Obvious tie-ins are hoped for, but I haven't read that bestseller; I was referred to Third Secret via Amazon and enjoyed it as a relative rarity, a theological thriller.<br /><br />You have to love any book that contains these lines: a key figure \\"produced a small black controller. 'One press and Swiss guards charge into this room. Assaulting the pope is a serious crime.'\\" (308) And admire, whatever prose or creed you incline towards, this description of a skeptical witness of a visionary: \\"For an instant he thought he caught a glimmer of light in her pupils--two quick flashes of a reflected image--a swirl of blue and gold. His head whirled left, searching for the source, but there was nothing. Only the sunlit corner and the silent statue. Whatever was occuring was apparently [the visionary's] alone.\\" (237. No plot spoilers, thus the brackets.)<br /><br />Not up to the apocalyptic shocks of GK Chesterton's The Man Who Was Thursday--which I highly recommend to any reader of Berry--but a quick-paced, if rather too fast-moving, reimagining of Marian visions, not only of Fatima but relating to common trends also seen at LaSalette, Lourdes, and Medjugorje. (Garabandal and other discredited ones would have been clever to throw in as contrasts with those to which the Church has deemed \\"worthy of assent.\\" And Berry's legal eye works well here to analyze the implications of this at first supportive phrase from Rome, which leads into the heart of the tension in this story. I am glad I did not read many of the earlier posted reviews here, as they give away far too much of the plot. The chapters, I agree with other critics, are often too telegraphic, and with 71 of them I felt as if I was reading merely Berry's expanded outline too often.<br /><br />For me, not wanting to diminish the suspense denoted in the novel's subtitle, suffice to say I found it a notch above the \\"airport reading\\" I expected. Berry has done a commendable job in relating serious theological debate on issues of the utmost importance to Catholicism and incorporates a lot of expository byways that prove also intriguing. Why prelates wear skullcaps, what is addressed to a dead pope three times, how St. Malachy's alleged prophecies might mesh with the German pope neatly elected after this novel's publication and its fictional Teutonic pontiff, and the clash of humanism and authority within such structures as the former Irish homes for unwed mothers and today's celibate mandate for (unless you transfer from the Anglican priesthood as already married!) Latin rite priests and clergy makes for often thoughtful as well as enlightening engagement well above a genre-bound page-turner. A brief afterward documents Berry's research and his alterations.<br /><br />The strengths I found most emanated from Michener's struggle with his vocation, although why he entered the priesthood seems a mystery. A stronger connection with his Irish past remained  necessary; the links Berry crafts here feel too flimsy. The fey clerical henchmen defies credibility--although even he does surprise me a bit, credit to the author I admit. (I was half-expecting him--and his episcopal manipulator--to be part of that dependable Dan Brown scapegoat Opus Dei, so heavy-handed was the sidekick's character and the clumsiness with which he--and again his employer--was drawn by the author.)<br /><br />If you decide to take the plunge, stick with the middle portion--what's predictable does swerve again into more satisfying speculation despite the utter unreality of what a pope would be most concerned with immediately upon election to the throne, and all the jet flights across Europe, however quickly accomplished, blur crucial periods of the action into unbelievably action-driven scenes involving cardinals as well as connivers. That such high-ranking figures would be skulduggerers amidst the pomp of a papal investiture never convinced me at all.<br /><br />I don't care how much \\"the fate of the Church\\" depends on the third secret--it remained preposterous that its highest figures would be dashing about Eastern Europe while a pope died and another lurked to grab St. Peter's chair. (Speaking of which, I suspect Berry muddles papal infallibility--which has to be \\"from the chair,\\" or ex cathedra explicitly stated, not, as he proposes, in any matter even of faith or morals, unless I am wrong. Viz. \\"Cathedra\\" in the Oxford Dict. of the Christian Church: \\"No authoritative statement exists as to which particular Papal pronouncements are 'ex cathedra'.\\")<br /><br />The love interests occupy a respectable portion of the plot and prepare the reader for wider relevance as the climax approaches. I was moved by the final portions of this novel, and only wish that they could be fulfilled, personally and for the Church. If the ending strikes other Amazonians as preposterous, consider that as I read this novel, cardinals were gathered at the Vatican to gingerly hint at possible liberalization of celibacy for priests, as an Eastern rite Melkite priest argued to his Latin rite confreres.<br /><br />Berry, astutely, has a relevant subject: a German pope, this ever-deepening conflict within the priesthood as vocations decline and congregations in the Third World increase, and the vexing tug-of-war between clerical and lay factions as to married clergy, reproductive freedom, gay unions, and the expression of sexuality. With a nimble mind if not the most agile construction, this novel should challenge readers of any faith who place all their faith in a fixed, unchanging revelation.

It did take me a long time to finish, and while I cannot comment on whether the fact of translation (which I always suspect when I slowly read applicable novels in English) or the details amassed by Kohout were the cause, the density of atmosphere as Prague struggles to free itself from its captivity as the capital of the Reich's Protectorate makes for a fittingly somber and moving fictional thriller, combined with a thoughtful meditation, thanks especially to Gestapo functionary Buback and his love Grete, on how decent people can redeem themselves--and perhaps others--from barbarity for which they have been too long its too complacently silent perpetrators.<br /><br />This added depth to an already intricate whodunit enriches the plot. It's not perfect. A map should have been added for the benefit of readers not familiar with Prague's byways. Even as a repeat visitor there, I wished for some guidance, as much of the action in the later chapters depends upon the barricades and escapes among its city streets and districts, as the German and native elements make their assaults and retreats.<br /><br />The action itself, although it starts finally to intensify after the news of Hitler's suicide begins to encourage and discourage the novel's various characters, might have moved along far quicker; although the novel never bogged down, it did wander off on detours that detracted from the intensity of its central clash between liberators and oppressors. I do not read mysteries or thrillers normally, so I may be not the best critic of such genre conventions regarding pacing. The murders, thinking about it in retrospect, uneasily shift from those of psycho-sexual delusion to those excused on behalf of a vengeful populace, and although this transfer is less than smoothly accomplished, it does perhaps represent more accurately the sudden jerks of the crazed mind rather than the controlling author.<br /><br />As I stated earlier, I'd love to read more about some of the key figures as the Czech democrats succumbed to the Communists, and certainly Kohout's own age and experience would make him an excellently placed observer and chronicler. In the meantime, this novel may not describe much of the beloved postcard Prague, but conjures up the sinister shadows that, when I walked along Bartolemeska street, I could still enter, left by decades of its prominence as the dark facades where the police and the jail loomed even as the flags changed.ce, and although this transfer is less than smoothly accomplished, it does perhaps represent more accurately the sudden jerks of the crazed mind rather than the controlling author.  <br /> <br />As I stated earlier, I'd love to read more about some of the key figures as the Czech democrats succumbed to the Communists, and certainly Kohout's own age and experience would make him an excellently placed observer and chronicler.

My subject line rephrases the title of Malcolm Bradbury's travelguide spoof from the pre-Wall 80's, \\"Why Come to Slaka,\\" itself a spin-off of his academic satire \\"Rates of Exchange\\" behind the Iron Curtain in what must have been a Warsaw Pact neighbor formerly known as Slaka, a post-89 casualty no doubt. While Slaka did not survive Balkanized glasnost, Molvania lives.<br /><br />As a repeat traveler to not only Prague but the bucolic countryside of Bohemia and the Hungarian puzsta plains near Romania, I confess this book triumphed. On every page, without fail, I chuckled--often more than once. And I rarely laugh out loud at movies, unless it's caused by unintentionally funny plaints or exertions by artistes. As other reviewers have noted, the Molvanian jokes do get stale--like much of the native cuisine I gather--on extended exposure. This traveller's guide is best savored while a few minutes on the toilet, waiting for your computer to boot, or while being put on hold on the phone--the closest counterpart to an inimitably Molvanian experience.<br /><br />My two pre-teen sons love its illustrations and captions; much of the fun is not only in the text but the deadpan earnestness of the layout, the boldfaced emphases, the maps and not least future offerings in the Jet Lag Series blurbed on the back pages. For the educated P.C. reader seeking novelty, this vademecum will surpass any common guide meant for the hoi polloi.<br /><br />Any customer of Rough Guides/Lonely Planets will recognize not only their feel but their ambiance, as reassuring platitudes of the politically correct phrasing guaranteed to offend no culture mesh into the timid warnings for Westerners gingerly tiptoeing off the beaten track. The potted biographies of hapless or jaded contributors, the photo/text matches, the sober histories and the determinedly fair-minded rankings of accomodations, eateries, and attractions make for hilariously stereotypical reading, within which any armchair or experienced journeyer will ruefully recognize not only one's self but countless ranks of conniving clerks, finagling waitpersons, surly vendors, supercilious guides, gesturing drivers, and fearsomely (non?)communicative forays beyond phrasebooks. As the book instructs us, the departure fee from Molvania may be 3000 strubli, \\"but most visitors agree it's well worth the price.\\" The entry fee's far cheaper and no less valuable an encounter, in the Jet Lag new but already time-honored tradition of \\"taking you places where you don't want to go.\\"perienced journeyer will ruefully recognize not only one's self but countless ranks of conniving clerks, finagling waitpersons, surly vendors, supercilious guides, gesturing drivers, and fearsomely (non?)communicative forays beyond phrasebooks.

US	53087372	R15VHT1QRQXNW1	1854113097	274258643	The Chosen People: Wales and the Jews	Books	3	7	8	N	N	Anthology of Welsh writers on Jewish topics	This is not a narrative history or a scholarly investigation. I was a bit misled by the publisher's description; this book focuses mainly on quite recent, 20th century, literary mentions of Jews by Welsh authors, considerations of the establishment of the state of Israel by Welsh politicians and religious figures, and extracts from a smaller number of pre-20c preachers and storytellers on Welsh-Jewish affinities. It is not a truly academic study for there are but three brief footnotes appended, no index, and a brief but serviceable 10-pg. introduction by the editor.<br /><br />Davies has done a service by translating much of these materials, previously scattered, half only in Welsh originally, and I only wish that a fuller incorporation of the earlier period had been included. While the publisher suggests the scope of this research goes back to the 6th c. this is barely glanced at in the book. Little of the earlier stages of Welsh consideration of the Jews apparently exists, according to the contents here assembled.<br /><br />Davies does caution that the pre-Reformation divines and mythmakers did not focus much on Israel or the Jews; a look at the fascinating pseudo-scholarship long dabbled in by British Israelites may have seemed like a tangent for this admittedly small anthology, but such forays into proto-Celt/patriarchial roots by misled etymologists might have enriched this collection and added to its value for curious readers and curiouser scholars today.	2005-10-06

Reading the extensive footnotes, I realized only after finishing the body of the text that when Patricia Puma was trapped early in the attacks, she was being interviewed by phone with one of the co-authors, for the NY Times. She never escaped. I wonder how the two authors felt, talking to those dead within the building, and later crafting this book which commemorates and enlivens the lucky and the doomed. Flynn & Dwyer bring a sensitivity to their meticulous reporting, and never preach, sentimentalize, or rant.<br /><br />I had followed some of their coverage, along with their staff, in the NYT after the bombings, and material from these earlier stories, along with excellent graphics detailing the problems in stairwells, elevators, and concourse exits heightens considerably the effective arguments the co-authors make for how technological flaws and logistical rivalries between the Port Authority, the NYFD, and the NYPD made for mistakes that could have been rectified before 9/11. The authors make their case for those responsible, indirectly, over the years that the towers were planned, erected, and remodeled. Comparisons with the Empire State Building of a previous generation, and the legacy of the Triangle Factory fire make especially helpful comparisons.<br /><br />The authors firmly point out how fireproofing codes had been eased, stairwells had been narrowed for maximizing floor space and therefore profit, elevators shifted into the interior, and radios bought but never effectively tested, taught, or employed all worsened the city competition between its law & order forces. Police helicopters flew up, firefighters milled below. The conditions under which the NYFD had to climb up particularly led, as the authors persuade, to their demise while many would have been gasping for air rather than able to help civilians in the second tower before its collapse, which the authors repeatedly document was held to be impossible by many of those --rescuers or victims--waiting for deliverance inside.<br /><br />The acts of heroism moved me without being cloyingly conveyed. The transcripts of the messages relayed by those trapped become integrated deftly into the larger chapters that tell of myriad construction, bureaucratic, and physical minutiae that the authors assemble, with a prose style eloquent without being grandiose, into a swiftly expressed whole. The understatement about the horror of those especially on the 78th floor at the time of the second assault lingers, as does the heroism of fire chief Orio Palmer and the astonishing survival of Stanley Praimnath, who saw the United jet crash into his window as he dived under his desk. I do wish a bit more information about the area around the towers was explained, as for those like myself unfamiliar with the area, it became difficult to understand where those in the vicinity being assembled to climb or evacuated from the towers were gathered.<br /><br />Whatever your position on the larger geo-political issues, any intelligent reader can learn from this account. The authors state the conditions on that morning in rather unadorned, for the most part muted, fashion. One sentence, near the end, however, deserves special notice: \\"In a world where zealots could see only icons to smash, the attacks made sense; in a world where people like Dianne DeFontes sat alone in an empty law office, eating yogurt and answering phones, the idea that the attack had fallen on the representatives of a superpower seemed hallucinatory.\\" (248)<br /><br />I wonder, then, what a critic of the supposed \\"little Eichmanns\\" such as Ward Churchill would make of this book, which powerfully expresses the extremes of fear and hope endured by everyday folks from around the world, hundreds of feet up, so high that the firefighters saw the explosions of smaller fires as if peering at distant supernovae.e explosions of smaller fires as if peering at distant supernovae.	2005-09-24

When the narrator, whose name changes so often that, by the end of the book, you like her may have forgotten her original identity, mulls over how her prayer was only \\"please not yet\\" in crisis and nothing more, you realize how much of a role fate had in who survived and who did not.<br /><br />The relentlessness of the extermination, here not in the camps but in everyday life for those who manage to disguise, if for a time, their Jewishness, reveals itself in the constant danger of exposure, not only by the Germans but by the Poles who might stumble upon the truth about the narrator and her accomplices from back home. Even as they escape the ghetto for Germany as slave laborers, they cannot fully trust their own fellow nationals. Accents, mundane details, imagined native cities and schools, catechisms, hymns and Christmas celebrations, relatives of potential informers who knew them in their homeland: all of these factors never ease but briefly, no matter how far they seem from their origins, posing as one invented character after another.<br /><br />This strain of brazenly acting--even before the Gestapo--so often as to (nearly?) obliterate one's true self makes the tension of this novel interiorized as well as represented in the often sparely but grippingly related events. I had heard an excerpt from this novel read on NPR, knowing nothing of the author, back on publication in 1992, and have never forgotten it. A small shortcoming is the telescoping of events at the close, and an afterward that seems too awkwardly expressed. But the force of this clearly told, unsentimentalized, and very immediate novel makes for a fresh take on events from a less memorialized perspective: of those who went underground within the Reich to survive. Ida Fink has written two other collections of sketches and stories based on real events, and deserves your attention for her careful craft.survive.

Bibliophiles, introverts, eccentrics, and loners such as the narrator and his subjects provide the ideal audience for a book about stubborn individuals, largely focused around the Suffolk coast, who resist the tide, metaphorically and practically.<br /><br />Languor permeates these pages. At times, the recitation of facts about Conrad and Casement, the plot of Borges' story on Tlon, or the history of silk manufacturing seemed too much potted or borrowed to engage me with whatever additional insights I'd have expected Sebald to enrich these anecdotes. More successful are his examinations of the eroding Lowescroft, the man with the Temple of Jerusalem model, and the fittingly named LeStrange. When Sebald reports more on the local rather than the otherwise known, his concentration improves and the book nourished by these more primary sources rather than secondhand summations.<br /><br />Best of all is his account of a terrible storm and its aftermath, where the trees' denudation and the stars' reclamation of the blackout skies over this stretch of the coast make for gripping imagery. His passion emerges, albeit subtly, here, and his poetry on devastation made me want to seek out his last work, On the Natural History of Destruction. Tangentially, allusions to the earlier military obliteration are made in his reveries on the RAF base and its German targets, and no doubt readers of his more-German centered work will want to read his preparatory thinking, as it were, in the hauntingly titled--if you read the epigraph--Rings of Saturn. These, symbolically, are only discussed in this part of this unclassifiable memoir/novel.	2005-09-21

As the blurb for the book on this site summarizes, this combines two stories, one from the Arthurian, post-Roman era and one from today, set in 1993. Figgis reminds me of Charles Williams' own difficult fiction (she cites him in a quote), which likewise sought to merge the supernatural plane with our own mundane. Her knowledge of archeology and the \\"dark ages\\" of Britain makes for the most involving aspect of this tangled tale. She delays, like a crafty storyteller, clarifying details of the story until much later than a reader might expect, and even at its close, this novel leaves spaces still unfilled.<br /><br />Its unforgiving erudition makes this at all times a daunting rather than diverting read, and it's a very serious story, with not much humor or wit to lighten its considerably relentless gloom. It deserves a more educated reader than I am to excavate and label all of its layered artifacts. Figgis labors to re-create not only the decay of post-Roman Wales but the decline of one modern man's life, and the parallels, although never obviously juxtaposed, make for instructive insights, which she does not--to her credit but relying upon the reader's consistent and not entirely rewarded effort--simplify or reduce to truisms.<br /><br />While I expected an easier novel, this does show that Figgis takes her audience as seriously as she does her fiction, and this is probably a step above the usual Arthurian fantasy. My one criticism is that I sensed that secondary characters remained too willfully mysterious throughout, and the lack of explanation for many of the more mundane events--as well as those more symbolic--irritated me. Figgis does not provide enough clues to unlock all of the puzzles she places within the way of Kerr's quest, for him or for us. More disturbing, unsettled in its characterization, and opaque in what would have been in other novels clues that would have been eventually made transparent, her novel may frustrate more likely than entertain. She knows a great deal about the time she restores here, Arthur is by the way off-stage rather than the protagonist, and both The Tracker and Cathal Kerr remain enigmatic central characters beyond the last pages of what does not reach simple closure as a conventional \\"time-travel\\" tale.arent, her novel may frustrate more likely than entertain.

Mainly on the Bosnian-Serbian front in the earlier period of the 90s conflict, Loyd does give you lots to mull over.<br /><br />One vignette: he looks through a sniper's night scope from a Sarajevo roof down upon the enemy, who in stirring separates himself, Loyd recalls, from a dark blur into a form resembling again a man. Loyd can shoot, refrains, and meditates how easily he can make the choice. Another: the legacy of Tito, he opines, left its suddenly divided religious and ethnic factions knowing nearly nothing about what supposedly now separated them, and much about what they had in common: the worship of \\"vlast,: of power and the common man, as well as the intellectual's, duty to take sides when before these sides mattered none at all as youths. Finally, I recall late in the book his terrible descriptions of Grozny in Chechnya and of a massacre in a Bosnian hamlet. No matter how many you many have read, these atrocities do stay with you, a testimony to his powers as a writer.<br /><br />These skills, amazingly, mingle with lots of not only alcohol but much harder drugs, and how Loyd can recall so much given his psychic self-devastation gives the title he has chosen for his memoir its own horror. His father's estrangement, his boarding school trauma, and his own downward spiral may vitiate the force of his wartime stories, but these events do show the aftermath, and the background, of why Loyd found solace and allure in such perilous places as to draw him away from London after the Gulf War to return to battlegrounds willingly.<br /><br />My only caveat is that these later complications, as in his father's turmoil, do weaken somewhat the impact of the book as a whole, however thematically Loyd may have wished them to serve as bookends for his war experiences. More successful, if no less fragmented, his own family history spans recent Europe's own divisions, his recent relatives having fought against each other for Britain as well as Nazi Germany. The continental dimension within his own family memories enriches what often has been a type of account limited to a citizen from one place going to another and then home again. Loyd's refusal to compartmentalize blame may make him less popular among his slicker media comrades, but his honesty, lacerating as it is, is hard-earned truth.ds willingly.  <br /> <br />My only caveat is that these later complications, as in his father's turmoil, do weaken somewhat the impact of the book as a whole, however thematically Loyd may have wished them to serve as bookends for his war experiences.

What the blurb omits is the prescience of this book, written in 1978, that anticipates a variety of trends early on. Redfern works for a CNN-type media multinational conglomerate, Insatel, and Williams' uses his former-radical status to comment incisively upon globalization, the yuppie phenomenon (although probably before the word was coined--he'd have known of it, as the author of \\"Keywords,\\" if anyone would have...), and the compromises made by idealists who need to make a living in the decade following the collapse of the utopian ideals of the 60s.<br /><br />I like a point (p. 6): speaking of Insatel, the narrator: \\"The network already installed for spectacle has this subsidiary facility for unarranged events.\\" The root meaning of \\"facility\\" expresses cleverly the insights this book is full of. Williams may not have been able to write much fiction, given his considerable critical analyses, and this novel is a bit clumsy in its efforts to move the considerably complicated plot forward when it is so entangled with the author's own intellectual applications of the post-60s response by the Crown, the press, and subversive elements to the whodunit case. The ambiguity of the last page narrated does make for a fittingly elusive end. It seemed as if a sequel could have followed, as it's quite open.<br /><br />Still, it's a worthwhile read, if not the easiest to come by now. The trouble of many scenes is that they do not emerge with enough descriptive detail, and many conversations tend to blur with little distinction. One chapter takes verbatim a pamphlet but its prose does not differ enough from that of the narrator.

You get less of a sense of why to visit so many of the places rather than where to sleep and munch when you get there. This emphasis on the practical, of course, makes this an essential reference for any traveller. Yet, I would supplement it with cultural reading and research before planning a vacation, for too often too little of the reasons to go to one place rather than another are lacking in this Lonely Planet guide.<br /><br />Extra credit, however, for stimulating, if too brief, introductory material at the start that places as marginalia recommended books and websites (inevitably some of the latter being puffed up as better than they actually are regarding their depth). Too often in many guides, such lists are appended rather than featured prominently. All in all, a helpful nuts-and-bolts guide to where to go and what to do, but as I mentioned, the why will be better found in other books and guides for the newcomer.	2005-09-10

It's pretty much a curio of its time--the McCarthy era, from the vantage point of a radical protester who found himself at odds with the administration for a trip he had taken to Russia in the 1930s. Kent's bluster and bravado infuses every page of this hectoring, big-shouldered, he-man tale, and as an artist known once widely for his engravings, drawings, paintings, and adventures in Greenland and points north of Maine, it brings back, in exhaustive detail, his upbringing and his thoughts and his tale over the first part of the last century.<br /><br />The illustrations, curiously, are interspersed throughout the volume in abundance, if not where you would expect them to comment upon the precise page upon which they are placed. Kent notes that they are to comment on the text, idiosyncratically! I do not know if many people remember Kent today, but his prose and artistic style of bold lines and deep cuts, shadows, heroism, robust men and lissome (if solidly built) women certainly recalls a whole era of Depression-era America, when so many volumes, government-sponsored art projects, and public and private buildings were graced with this now-bygone spirit of optimism and humanism.	2005-09-07

It can be found in larger publuc libraries, however. Sarah, nearing forty and recently diagnosed with a lump in her breast, decides to visit \\"Ulster\\" in mid-July, unaware of the celebrations of the Twelfth indulged in by that area's Loyalist community. A liberal who works at Cambridge, Welsh-speaking originally, leftist liberal but no Nationalist, nominally Protestant only because she is not Catholic, her sharpish tongue, no-nonsense observations, and wry mix of self-pity and idealism make for a busy week on the other side of the Irish Sea.<br /><br />Glennie provides a cast of characters who, in their varying views on the situation beginning to worsen in the North, show everything from Marxist to Nationalist to Republican to Unionist to indifferent reactions to what ails the province. Seeing that she wrote before the worse stage of the war, her attempts to show, filtered through her own Welsh-Cambridge sensibility, the effects not only of war but desire for sexuality from the attitude of Sarah, long widowed and seeking to renew an affair she had previously five years back with a Protestant journalist sympathetic to the Civil Rights campaign, makes for a thoughtful examination by one Celt of another Celtic-tinged struggle for identity within a fracturing British-dominated system.<br /><br />Particularly engaging are Sarah's reactions to the \\"stage-Irishry\\" within both Catholics/Nationalists and Protestants/Unionists are trapped, once the cameras come. The Hollywood-ization of the country that preceded the outbreak of violence gains a rarely addressed forum here.<br /><br />The ending is not predictable, and although melodramatic elements do enter to spice up the plot, Gallie remains fair-minded to all involved in the story, and even though in the relative compression of time and place that this novel features, her fresh perspective by a Welsh woman on the Irish divisions that have already begun to spread--resisting the Anglo invader, or collaborating for the benefits of liberal democracy?--to Wales ensure that this overlooked novel remains relevant today.features, her fresh perspective by a Welsh woman on the Irish divisions that have already begun to spread--resisting the Anglo invader, or collaborating for the benefits of liberal democracy?--to Wales ensure that this overlooked novel remains relevant today.	2005-09-06

It's not a quick read, and quite dense in parts. Fans of post-modern fractured looks at Britain presumably know what they'll encounter here. Those, like myself, with less experience with the likes of not only Sinclair but Moorcock, Ackroyd, & Chris Petit (whose The Psalm Killer is a great take on the Irish Troubles in 90s Belfast) may find it a tough slog.<br /><br />In parts, notably the few pages on post-Thatcher Wales and the episodes on the poet-artist David Jones in his stay with Eric Gill at Capel-y-ffin, the relatively straightforward tale telling and powerful descriptions work wonders. But the greater tale of Kaporal and his pursuit of disgraced politician Jeremy Thorpe, along with the suicides in the West Country and the mixing in of Sinclair's own Landor-ing tries at a novel and his own semi-autobiographed childhood, make for less than knockout fiction, over the course of 350 pp.<br /><br />The trouble is that, as Sinclair's clever enough to incorporate (285) a character who critiques accurately Sinclair's faults as a writer, is that Sinclair seems too self-satisfied to keep on meandering in the same groove. A mish-mash of events rather than an attempt to learn from them, the ultimate laziness of Sinclair, masked as a Borgesian or Burroughian exercise in the nature of unreliable truth & fiction, seems tired and listless far too often. My three rather than two stars are credit to the effort Sinclair puts into many small details that work well, but even these fail to resonate beyond a few pages at a time.<br /><br />This lack of quality control leaves lots of glintingly crafted needles among the prosy haystacks that'll prick your attention, but I wish there were so many more. Colin Tunstall's attempt to revive the utopian dream, Prudence & Annwn and the Mabinogion, the clash of pulp vs. poetry, the Eagleton quote on the literature of a subject people tending towards neologisms, shamanism, and farcical excess, the details on the Bob Dylan photo at Aust ferry (that conincidentally graces the new Scorcese Documentary on the bard): these may bolster his thesis that \\"endlessness is immortality\\" in the accumulation of facts, opinions, and observations, but I doubt if Sinclair himself will wind up among the immortals of Brit Lit.<br /><br />His newly proclaimed Welsh origins caused hin, evidently, to aspire to a take-down of both the Welsh and the English, but the dreariness inherent in a plague on both houses dispirits the whole enterprise, and after hundreds of pages of inconclusive material, a wish for a more succinct and focused control over so much promising raw data may mean that I'm less trendy than the likes of Sinclair, but a story does come first, immortal or not.s, shamanism, and farcical excess, the details on the Bob Dylan photo at Aust ferry (that conincidentally graces the new Scorcese Documentary on the bard): these may bolster his thesis that \\"endlessness is immortality\\" in the accumulation of facts, opinions, and observations, but I doubt if Sinclair himself will wind up among the immortals of Brit Lit.    <br /> <br />His newly proclaimed Welsh origins caused hin, evidently, to aspire to a take-down of both the Welsh and the English, but the dreariness inherent in a plague on both houses dispirits the whole enterprise, and after hundreds of pages of inconclusive material, a wish for a more succinct and focused control over so much promising raw data may mean that I'm less trendy than the likes of Sinclair, but a story does come first, immortal or not.	2005-09-06

But the Insight Guide packs a lot of cultural information, historical background, and analytical mini-essays into its admittedly heftier bulk than other guides. It gives, say, far less architectural detail or in-depth context than a Blue Guide, but fills out the often skimpier coverage of a more popular guide listing hotels, restaurants, and attractions along the descriptive essays--written by various authors--on each region. Appendices list the typical details of where to eat, sleep, spend, stretch, and slouch; the separation of this data may make for either a more--or less--user-friendly guide.<br /><br />The nuances, since many writers contribute, on such topics as the incomers buying and restoring homes in Welsh-speaking areas, the rise and fall of the mining valleys, the parlous state of the native language and the effects of deevolution, Snowdonia's beauty and its fragile state when so many climb its peaks, the revitalization of Cardiff, and the reason there's so many castles--these all gain thoughtful if brief treatment.<br /><br />A good appetizer to whet the appetite before you go. You will not obtain itineraries in-depth of where-to-turn, how late it's open, how much it costs. But as a background planner, resource, and pictorial (not to be understated when thinking about where you want to visit, although it looks suspiciously sunny all the time) panorama, this is a carefully prepared yet not overwhelmingly meticulous resource.	2005-09-01

Unfortunately, this novel seemed to sink itself irretrievably into the gloomy village it labors to describe. I felt as if I was watching a Masterpiece Theatre episode for Anglo-agoraphobes that left me indifferent rather than involved.<br /><br />The elements for a good story are there: Thomas Ellis can initially establish distinguishable if satirically wounded character types, but they listlessly poke about the pages, muttering and pottering about without a real plot to entice you or action that shakes up the doldrums that the author evidently has lived in herself so long that she lacks the cognition to make such a realm vivid and intriguing for first-time visitors to her Anglo-Welsh family, who seem trapped in amber as much as the dim and clouded ambiance that pervades this dreary book.	2005-08-25
US	53087372	RFLM8S9KN4YT6	0786712066	349135328	Dislocation: Stories from a New Ireland	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Mixed bag of stories from "younger" Irish writers	The editor commissioned these stories from Irish-born (or in one case, Irish American) writers, all under 50, who try to put into their imagined settings the real unease experienced by Irish within the past generation. Not all of the stories directly take place in or even address Ireland; the common thread only that there's an Irish provenance to their authors. This makes for a more diverse collection than the subtitle might suggest. Such diffusion, therefore, makes also for a less than satisfying impact as an anthology with a central unifying theme.<br /><br />Aidan Mathews, whose novel \\"Muesli at Midnight\\" is a rarely acknowledged gem, gets all too infrequent coverage; his two story collections are worth seeking out. He, earlier than others, brought a European dimension into his fiction as the \\"Celtic Tiger\\" was no more than purring. Taking James Bond's cinematic incarnations as a link across the 60s into the 70s, a barber and his surgeon customer carry on a conversation over the years that makes for a more traditional character study echoing the mid-20c masters of Irish short stories.<br /><br />Blanaid McKinney's tale takes a while to work its magic. A priest has ditched his school post for a fling in London with a woman who may or may not lead to his leaving his position. His disillusionment with London's relentless adverts and the tawdry culture they and his lover embrace and celebrate leads to a moment of decision for him. It reminds me of what Kieslowski could have filmed as one of the parts of his film \\"Dekalog.\\"<br /><br />Eilis Ni Dhuibhne embeds in many of her stories folkloric elements, and Riding Hood sports a new tailor in her offering. Again, a slow starter, in three at first seemingly disconnected parts, this follows a librarian from a country like Sweden or Denmark into a place like Vienna. She meets an Italian man who claims a recent separation from his wife and grown daughter. The bond they tenuously share does not work out in predictable fashion, but it does satisfy for its link to Europe's wider traumas against which the protagonist must measure her own pack of troubles.<br /><br />Sean O'Reilly's novel set in his native city of Derry, \\"Love and Sleep,\\" offered little of either but a lot of post-modern angst, brutal if infrequent coupling, and a main character who'd you'd hope never to meet in a pub. This all applies again to his story, \\"Playboy,\\" and if this is your type of milieu, O'Reilly's for you. He writes well, but seems too smitten with the demi-monde. Sort of like Celine or Genet stuck in an Irish theme-pub.<br /><br />Which leads to the twist, an Irish pub tarted up as an Aussie one in Judes Cross, where a market-town trying to become the next Tidy Town (like real-life Adare?) makes for one dissatisfied publican. Tom Humphries' \\"Australia Day\\" works more as a commentary than a full-fledged story, but it does elaborate well this relentless and soul-draining plundering of the tourists' purse that inescapably accompanies Ireland's own marketing of itself as both authentic, pricy, and au courant.<br /><br />Joseth O'Neill's \\"Ponchos\\" never addresses Ireland, but many of those on the barstools in the NYC pub could've been transplants from the two previous tales. His tragicomic story reminds me of those of Matthew Klam, author of \\"Sam the Cat,\\" in their common examination of threatened males in an Sirens-like reverie of increasingly assertive, tempting, yet unattainable (unless in fantasy or a brief moment) women who make for all the wrecked and lonely people--once lovers and now only couples--today. It's simply told but moves quickly and with needed banter and wit.<br /><br />Keith Ridgway's \\"Grid Work\\" takes a more successful (at least in his bank account and status) alpha-male who, seven-foot-two, lives in planes, so it seems to him. At least not in economy. His outpouring of anxiety, his refusal to talk on planes, and his globalized deracination all remind me of Michel Houllebecq's males in similarly technologicall advanced environs but reductively primitive, self-constructed, cages of rationality.<br /><br />The rest of the stories did not work for me. Claire Keegan gives what felt like the never-ending story based on a mad priest, a tale of \\"feet water,\\" a bachelor farmer, his quondam mate, and heaps of rural melancholia. John Mac Kenna's \\"Maps\\" imitated  the insular studies of John McGahern if with more expletives; the father-son struggle needs a lot of originality to propel still another short story. Molly McCluskey's story of two girls growing up and apart on the East Coast was respectable enough for her MFA-type of writing that is so plentiful, but felt out of place in this anthology when technically she's outshined by  O'Neill and McKinney's analogous relationship studies.<br /><br />Finally, Mary Morrisy's tale of a instructor and her students alumped on the page and never roused itself. The set-up all too familiar, but more than character sketches need to add up for a story to gain its own momentum and impel the reader further. That's why, as a whole, the dialogic energy of Mathews, the insight of McKinney and O'Neill that manages to avoid the predictable endings you thought you were headed towards, and the corss-cultural scope of Ni Dhuibhne, to name the four best, only somewhat off-set the acceptable nature of the middle stories listed and the drudgery of those last described.s males in similarly technologicall advanced environs but reductively primitive, self-constructed, cages of rationality. <br /> <br />The rest of the stories did not work for me.

While no information is given about the origin of these stories, only their late-90s dates, and that the collection was \\"originally published in Dutch\\", Ugresic has certainly assembled what the subtitle of her collection indicates. I cannot tell if these essays were written in her native language or in Dutch, which adds to the slight confusion I felt when dealing with these nearly thirty appetizers. If taken in small portions, she offers her thoughts efficiently.<br /><br />Contrasting the plight of the literary writer with the best-selling, commodified celebrity, she gives a series of elegies or curses at what looms as the funeral of the book for the educated reader. Now, she's preaching to the converted surely, given that the fine Dalkey Archive, a doughty holdout against the Oprah book clubs and Ivana Trump-driven marketplace, publishes her own efforts. But, over the course of only 220 pages, her critique wears so thin that she sounds griping rather than analyzing.<br /><br />She does warn that the \\"professor of literature\\" scolding tone does creep into these essays; I respond, though at a far more proletarian institution than the ones she teaches at: yes, \\"it takes one to know one.\\" I sympathize with her position, and support it, but the limitations of the 1000-word limit that straightjackets her into repetition and frequent lack of development keeps this anthology (the fiction, by the way, is negligible in amount compared to the essays) from wholly succeeding as a study of the decline of literary fiction and belles-lettres.<br /><br />Not that her comparisons lack hard-earned insight. Socialist realism and the optimism of self-help books, whether peddled in big-box retailers, on talk shows, or the glossy magazines, makes for an original thesis. She speaks movingly of exile and the manufactured status that this is supposed to confer upon the exile from the former Communist bloc. Juxtaposing Tito-era \\"houses of culture\\" in every village with the peddling of books as nostrums on TV, or women, smoking, and the sacrifices they make for the male-dominated literary elite illustrate her knack for not only clever but informative anecdotes from her own life in Yugoslavia. This element, as a Croatian who chose to flee her country once it attained independence, and once it co-opted so many of its intellectuals and fellow authors, makes for sobering reading about the seductive power that continues, after the Stalinist and Tito eras, to recruit willing propagandists who, as in the former times, subvert yet support the regime.<br /><br />So, this collection makes me want to read more of Ugresic. But, a warning--unless taken in small doses, you may find this brief but too ponderous assortment of essays too much for one or two sittings. She's confident, understandably aggrieved and rather bitter, and for better and worse, this is who you contend with while hearing her insistent and rather petulant voice in TYFNR.o confer upon the exile from the former Communist bloc.

(A Guide to Welsh Literature) Vol. VII	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Pioneering essays on mostly 20c poetry & fiction	When I asked a Welsh friend for a survey of recent Welsh literary history, he recommended this, which also goes by \\"Welsh Writing in English\\" and is actually the 7th and final volume in the series \\"A Guide to Welsh Literature\\"; the other volumes treat literature in the Welsh language. This imbalance shows how recently most of \\"Anglo-Welsh\\" has emerged as a contender against Welsh on the shelves. As opposed to Ireland, where two languages have battled it out for half a millenium, the canon of A-W literature remains in its formative stages; some authors going back and forth between the two languages as well.<br /><br />Since Amazon.com does not have a \\"look inside the book\\" offer here, I will simply give a quick peek at its contents. This volume arrives via the CREW project helmed by the editor at UW Swansea. Belinda Humfrey gives a pre-20c run-through, that ends in rather abrupt fashion, not the only essay to do so in this anthology. By the way, no drama is studied. Rather than take a \\"literary history\\" approach, the editor M. Wynn Thomas explains that he favored an assortment of critical perspectives from what is still a contested field. Therefore, the tone of the entries varies considerably, while adding to the personal feel of this collection, which admirably avoids jargon and can be read by not only scholars but novices like me productively.<br /><br />Stephen Knight offers an appropriately deep-delving and penetratingly thorough excavation into what many regard still as the stereotypical 20c \\"industrial novel\\"; he provides many examples that explore this long and well-mined strata well.<br /><br />John Powell Ward scrutinizes the border realms mentally and geographically and the tensions and energies they produce, from Arthur Machen a century ago to Iain Sinclair's typically baroque, po-mo 2001 exercise into his own only recently proclaimed origins, \\"Landor's Tower.\\" The whole London-Welsh continuum by such as these two bookending writers would have made, in fact, a fine additional chapter, but Ward and others do incorporate some of such cross-border alliances into their sections. Feminism, minority, and gay Welsh writers also gain the notice of critics throughout the volume, which has a helpful list of sources at the back, as well as end-of-chapter notes.<br /><br />Dylan Thomas and his contemporaries earn James A. Davies' attention--Dylan was the first Welsh writer in English to grab, like his contemporary Brendan Behan in Ireland, the celebrity Celt-as-dissolute bard costume and fit himself into it, for better or worse. The often overlooked efforts of those in his shadow gain by comparison and contrast with Dylan T. R.S. Thomas, Glyn Jones, Idries Davies, Alun Lewis, and Lynette Roberts all deserve renewed readerships.<br /><br />R.S. Thomas, Tony Conran, Raymond Garlick, Harri Jones, David Jones, and the notably eccentric Brenda Chamberlain all through the century--raised as estranged from Welsh-speaking Wales--sought to construct a less-anglicized identity, and Tony Brown & the editor look at their success or its lack in an involving chapter that should resonate with many readers from \\"hybrid\\" cultural backgrounds. Popular images of Welshness, what appealed or appalled earnest writers who learned about the Welsh past and its language, were exported, first and most famously by Richard Llewellyn (whose \\"How Green Was My Valley\\" was the first \\"Welsh\\" novel I read as a teenager, the only book in my public library under \\"subject: Wales: fiction). John Harris' chapter starts out rather slowly, and editing perhaps gives it an uneven tone, but his section on the fan letters generated by Llewellyn's best-seller make for the most memorable pages in the entire collection. Such criticism examining reader's responses to texts deserves many more adherents; it takes down from the academic tower into the shops and armchairs how ordinary folks receive and assimilate literature, more popular than most of what scholars analyze.<br /><br/>What happened in the next generation, \\"the Second Flowering,\\" sparked by the magazine Poetry Wales, is discussed with vigor and frankness rare in a scholarly context by one who was there, Tony Conran. Katie Gramich offers a spirited analogy between rugby and Welsh authors attempting the crossover into the British leagues of fame; the editor and Jane Aaron intellgently examine literary production between the defeat of devolution in 1979 and its success in the squeak-through of 1997. The miners vs. Maggie Thatcher understandably and movingly takes up much of the coverage in these decades as well, and whether a nationalist Welsh cause could sustain itself, and the role played or abandoned by writers in English, make for a valuable essay, in part because it confronts the Marxist assumption that the Welsh economic consternation should have \\"naturally\\" reified itself in the cultural and literary productions on a sustained and widespread level of production.<br /><br />Finally, the noted Welsh activist Ned Thomas (see his \\"The Welsh Extremist\\" published by Y Lolfa) approaches the past century and the present one's prospects by charting possible paradigms for literary success in raising alternatives to \\"false consciousness\\" in a Wales many of whose residents look more to the multinationals than the nationalists for progress./> <br />What happened in the next generation, \\"the Second Flowering,\\" sparked by the magazine Poetry Wales, is discussed with vigor and frankness rare in a scholarly context by one who was there, Tony Conran.

Yet Griffiths never stoops to shock. As graphic in their imagery, events, and language as his fictions have been, this Liverpool-born, Welsh residing writer means to scrape off the grime and get to the humanity--or its frequent lack--beneath the crustiness that coats many of his drug-addled protagonists and antagonists in nearly equal spoonfuls, bongloads, lager gulps, or needle pricks.<br /><br />In my Amazon review of his previous novel, \\"Kelly+Victor,\\" I wondered how long Griffiths could sustain his chosen milieu; the current Welsh-cum-Liverpudlian down-and-out, dole-and-drug addicted generation. Well, the epic with more than a handful of concurrent narrators, \\"Grits,\\" introduced his realm, if rather too lengthy a look at its denizens, who threatened to blur into not a willing victims' worth of a lost weekend but seemingly half-a-decade's staggering drama of binges, withdrawals, and scams.<br /><br />The comedown after the raves of unfortunately titled \\"Cool Cymru\\" followed in Sheepshagger, whose Ianto is now anonymously referred to as practically a rural (not urban?) legend by Darren and Alastair, the two young men who drive the plot and a car into Wales from Liverpool to intimidate an ex-Scouser as a \\"favor\\" for the two lads' drug kingpin. Griffiths whips back from Darren & Alastair to their target nimbly in alternating chapters, and the climactic moment paid off superbly, although the resolution of one of the two narrative strands seems so open-ended I'd have, if it was a movie, felt a sequel was necessary.<br /><br />The only drawback of an otherwise compactly conveyed, linear, macabrely entertaining, and exciting narrative is that Griffiths keeps alluding to other incidents that you're not sure happened in \\"Grits\\" or \\"Sheepshagger,\\" given the complexity and mass of detail in his previous novels covering literally, symbolically, and spiritually the same bleak landscapes.<br /><br />He may intend his novels to play off one another tangentially, as did Faulkner in his fictional county, but it is difficult (in the cases of both authors) to follow at times. Dialect usages, like the Welsh, go generally unexplained, and as this is \\"natural\\" for the speakers, I applaud Griffiths for forcing us into his characters' reality. Yet it does make it more challenging, and the alienation we feel as a result transforms his panoramas into even more foreign locales.<br /><br />Wonderfully if aggravatingly subversive, this novel, as with the previous two, shows Griffiths tightening his fictional control over his denizens, and he continues to improve as a writer by this compression of stark, raw, poetic Old-English and medievally-influenced language with equally raw observations in our beaten-down, insult-laden, vernacular. The diminishment of our modern dreams and capabilities Griffiths shows well by our decision to keep our verbal expression as minimal as our imagination, and the costs of this to such as Darren & Alastair.same bleak landscapes.  <br /> <br />He may intend his novels to play off one another tangentially, as did Faulkner in his fictional county, but it is difficult (in the cases of both authors) to follow at times.

I'm glad I hadn't read the summary or the comments before I opened Shroud--warning: major plot spoilers abound! Suffice it to say that David Lehman's \\"Signs of the Times\\" on the late 1980s Paul deMan revelations, while not receiving explicit credit in the author's notes, can shed light on the inspiration for Banville, much as the Blount spy episode does for The Untouchable, which pairs neatly with this novel as two portraits of unlikeable but captivating men that Banville sketches not with a righteous incrimination but a humanist compassion as he seems to report rather than construct their tales. No other comments have appeared on the triptych-like structure of the novel, so about this I will add a few words.<br /><br />The first part, the left-hand side of Banville's objet d'art, presents a smug, self-satisfied roue. I was thrown off, I admit, by the cleverly planted aside about the \\"Hebrew\\" neighbor who watches the scholar as he leaves Arcady, California--itself conveyed sharply and concisely in its summery smells and languid allure. It reminded me of Thomas Mann in Pacific Palisades in exile from the Nazis. Cass, at her entrance, appears annoyingly at his side, as if to whisper calumnies in his ear; at his other side I imagine the older Kristina Kovacs recriminating him with upraised finger and brow before an academic crowd--the whole rarified and curiously solipsistic atmosphere of a lit-crit conference amusingly captured, again by Banville, in only a couple of pages (it took David Lodge, no slouch himself, many novels to do the same--which I also highly recommend!). The scene of the woman run over in the street, which may appear on the margin of this segment, disturbed me greatly; it can be seen only more clearly in retrospect as foreshadowing, I suppose. This section's characteristic passage shows Banville's prose at its customary best: \\"Flakes of ash from his cigarette fell on her breast, tiny, warm, weightless kisses.\\" (76)<br /><br />In the central frame, the protagonist turns victim. Here, the Graham Greene-landish nature of Querell in The Untouchable seems to color the prose; \\"I would like to be the protagonist of one of those third-rate, so-called philosophical novles that were so popular in the haunted postwar years, the man who takes on the identity of a sinner all unaware that the one he is impersonating was a saint all along.\\" (150) While Banville avoids such a neat juxtaposition to his credit, this echo seems to issue from Greene's own fiction. This can best be seen in the miniature depictions: a mysterious train ride to and from Brussels, and the apparition of an ambiguous savior from the ruins of the protagonist's family home. The pace of this central action rouses itself from the torpor of the left-frame, part one.<br /><br />For the right-hand section, the action fades and after what for me was the climactic revelation around page 150, the remaining section is prepared for by: \\"The year and I are both declining; there is a chill in the air.\\" (177) With part three, the last sixty pages present more of a diminishing presence of all of the main characters. This last section, however, in its deliberately blurred and less substantially rendered details, involved me less than it could have. Death in Turin rather than Venice, yes, but again this morbidity shrouds the last segment in shadows more than sun. I see here the momento mori, the aging and contorted figures, the skulls and the devils awaiting below the ledge. If the opening of the book recalls Beckett, the end summons up the aftermath of another revelation--Greta to Gabriel, from Joyce's \\"The Dead.\\" For the protagonist of Banville's study, he is doomed to live on in a world of increasing gloom, descending while still alive into the Hades of his own making, and of what he has been made into by the ghosts of the last century. (P.S. See also my reviews of \\"Eclipse\\" and \\"Ancient Light.\\" These overlap with Axel Vander, Cass, and her father Alex Cleave's story.)e ghosts of the last century. (P.S.

The conceit of a tale told by a madman more sane than etc. etc. threatens to be a cliche as much as many of the elements: IRA bombers, sinister priests, wayward gals, small-town provincialism, Northern sectarian and Catholic sexual repression, that make up so many Irish-based films and fiction. How does McCabe fare in this novel, then?<br /><br />Judging by his later work, Call Me the Breeze (also reviewed by me on Amazon), I think the author has established his preference for the confessional tale told by a misfit who does dirty deeds done dirt cheap a bit too predictably. But not to judge by hindsight, so Breakfast, coming in between Butcher and Breeze, inevitably will suffer comparisons of F. Brady and P. Braden. Irish-English polarities become more prominent, as the action allows Pussy to leave the North for London, expanding the commentary beneath the superficially more daring gender-bending nature of this bildungsroman, the man from the provinces come to the big city. The glam and disco era, itself undermined on more than one level by bombings, perhaps more recently will unfortunately resonate anew for a London again associated with terror strikes. The tension between identity and conformity, or oppression and liberation, can be seen in Pussy and those with whom he is surrounded: Irish and English confrontation reified.<br /><br />William Trevor's novel and Atom Egoyan' film of Felicia's Journey might be an appropriate comparison: violence threatening a more innocent provincial Irish youth who is misled from the path that they take seeking resolution with the one who engendered them, the search for roots against those who manipulate that desire for the advancement of misguided power and fatal cruelty. I hope that readers of McCabe and viewers of the film keep in mind that McCabe strives, despite some clumsiness in the whole patient-shrink set-up as the framing device, to illuminate this struggle intelligently rather than sensationally.he whole patient-shrink set-up as the framing device, to illuminate this struggle intelligently rather than sensationally.	2005-08-14

He wrote over 500 works of inevitably wavering quality, but S&eacute;anna is the creative book upon which his reputation rests over a century after its first publication. This work was intentionally rendered by Fr &Oacute; Laoghaire to provide \\"modern\\" learners with an entertaining tale. It's arguably considered the first literary achievement of those native speakers who sought to revive Irish after the Famine and who would among anglicized adult learners seek to nourish its late 19c/early 20c revival.<br /><br />In this adaptation, admittedly simplified in spelling (into the subsequently mid-20c \\"school Irish\\" or \\"caighde&aacute;n\\" form) and dialect (some passages are excised, many words are standardized rather than kept in the Munster Irish of the original text) of the well-known folktale of selling one's soul to the Devil, Seanna the shoemaker makes the Faustian bargain with \\"an Fear Dubh\\" (the dark man, that is, the Devil) in return for thirteen years with his hand in a never-empty moneybag. While the language that its adapter favored may seem rather self-consciously quaint today, the matching of story and pictures here gains the full five stars, recommended for its pictorial quality and bound durability in its new printing.<br /><br />The notes, unfortunately, are skimpy and many more words than those few glossed will have to be looked up by the student. I found some cruxes remained in dialectal variations, and even the largest dictionary, &Oacute; Don&aacute;ill's \\"Focl&oacute;ir Gaeilge-Bearla,\\" did not readily divulge for me the meaning of some variants here employed in what aims to be an \\"easy\\" text. Yet, this is how we must learn a language: by grappling with the dictionary, our grammatical knowledge, and maturing instincts, right?<br /><br />The Dublin publisher Cois Life-- whose titles chart the whole range of quality literature and criticism in contemporary Irish-- is to be commended for this handsome edition, which in hardcover comes with an hour-long CD of the text recited. The font is easily read, although at times the accents (fada&iacute;) are hard to make out when above the letter \\"i.\\" Marie-Louise Fitzpatrick's beautifully watercolored illustrations add charm to this edition, ideal for learners of Irish, young or old.r />The Dublin publisher Cois Life-- whose titles chart the whole range of quality literature and criticism in contemporary Irish-- is to be commended for this handsome edition, which in hardcover comes with an hour-long CD of the text recited.

True, this storyline has marvellously observed moments, for me especially in the observation of the narrator's friend Max's academic parents in their separate studies, waiting impatiently for human contacts to ebb so they can get back to their research.<br /><br />But the arguments about atheism, agnosticism, and theology are scattershot and frankly rather disappointing, given their lack of originality. I expected more from this book, but instead of a sustained assault by a young thinker against too comfortable assumptions, instead I received a few hundred pages of a story that moved in fits and starts, with remarkably few interesting scenes, characters, or developments. I do admit that around the halfway point, the conversation between Tom and Colin does perk up the philosophical underpinnings that stay far too buried for most of the narrative. It barely earns two stars, only for attempts at insight that occasionally prove moving, if far too fleetingly. A glimpse of Wood's promise does emerge at the funeral of one of the main characters and the eulogy attempted by another (no plot spoilers) make for a finely tragicomic scene in the tradition of Waugh or Kingsley Amis.<br /><br />But the whole musical realm within which Jane is shown takes up energy that would have better been spent on Tom's own musings, if they were to convince us at all. A few potshots at Kierkegaard's name and admittedly frustrating aphorisms do not make much of a case for his \\"book against God\\" project. Now, is this rather Wood's point? The open-ended denouement may support a rejection of Tom's ambitions.<br /><br />If so, then these 250 pp. could have been better condensed and tightened into a fine novella. Wood gives you no real weight for his protagonist, who appears far too closely drawn on his own early experiences. This muddled semi-autobiographical portrait of a rebel academic shows only intermittent control of the fictional process. Without his previous reputation at the Guardian and New Republic, I wonder if this would have been published.

While other reviewers have dissected the spy background, the force of Banville's prose has gained less attention. He gives marvellous set pieces about entering the Kremlin's inner sanctum, of meeting his mother-in-law to be to ask for her daughter's hand, and of ghastly encounters with related royals at both Buckingham Palace and post-war Germany. Banville conveys the querulous self-deprecating, yet stubbornly principled, career of one claiming to be Irish, royalist, husband, father and queer, relative of the Windsors yet a committed Marxist loyal to Stalin's regime, all while in the pay of the Crown in peace, hot, and cold wars. If you're wondering about how the book's composed, not only what it's about, here's three samples.<br /><br />First, Victor ponders his unmasking. After noting how Marxism obviously replaces \\"the faith of my fathers,\\" he reflects: \\"But what comfort does belief offer, when it contains within it its own antithesis, the glistening drop of poison at the heart? Is the Pascalian wager sufficient to sustain a life, a real life, in the real world? The fact that you place your bet on red does not mean that black is not still there.\\" (96)<br /><br />On the next page: [. . .]I have a different definition of what constitutes effective action. The worm in the bud is more thorough than the wind that shakes the bough. This is what the spy knows. It is what I know.\\"<br /><br />Not all's so aphoristic. One favorite analogy, late in the book: eating lunch at the German Prince Willi (cousin to the British royals) after WWII, Victor recalls how the dumplings \\"looked like the testicles of a giant albino, and were so dense and repulsive that after my knife had gone through them the lips of the wound would shut again with a repulsive, kissing sound.\\" (302)<br /><br />Who can top that? If you like this tone, then read this intricately crafted novel! My only criticism is that the conceit of dictation to Miss Vandeleur, the excuse for Maskell's composition of his memoirs, seems a bit too pat and standard for this novel, and lacks dramatic tension. You also do not gain enough of a feel for broader reactions to Maskell's exposure, even if the hermeticism of most of what Maskell relates may be therefore intentional as his outside support system crumbles.<br /><br />But as to the story Maskell narrates, it's not to be missed. It takes its time developing, in a skillfully created but rather suspended ambiance that evokes well the more restrained early decades of Britain's last century. Up to the birth of his son, Maskell's memoir unfolds slowly and demands much patience; with the coming of the WWII, the pace quickens and the book picks you up with its brutal, queasy, yet honestly heartfelt, momentum.n of his memoirs, seems a bit too pat and standard for this novel, and lacks dramatic tension.

As my sympathies are with the Celts here and not the Saxons, perhaps I wish that Bailey had taken the side of the underdog more often. Read Ned Thomas' \\"The Welsh Extremist\\" from one of Bailey's key interviewees, a noted critic, for a pro-nationalist (obviously) counter-argument.<br /><br />Being pre-1997 with the arrival of devolution, this account may be a bit dated. However, Bailey--as an English writer now living in NYC--takes pains to present both the nationalists and the newcomers in as fair a light as he can, and his even-handedness provides readers with an honest examination of not only the natural beauties, very well-described especially in the mountain and moor scenes, but the human conflicts that still mark the Welsh landscape, home of the indigenous British. You truly feel the isolation when Bailey scales the hills and tells what he saw.<br /><br />This book may not sound, given its title, like a travelogue so much as one of those more innocuous sight-seeing, walk to the teahouse and back guides, but Bailey does make an effort, as his own list of sources shows, to update George Borrow's Victorian itinerary published as \\"Wild Wales\\" nearly a century and a half later. Jan Morris' \\"The Matter of Wales\\" deals with a lot of the same terrain in more panoramic and admittedly perhaps sentimental prose. Bailey, less loyal to any notion of patriotism, gives a more sober, pedestrian-level, accessible, introduction to many Welsh issues still vexed in our supposedly post-colonial era.	2005-08-06

For a critic who has devoted scrutiny to Dylan as well as the canonical heavy-hitting English canon of bards, Ricks comes equipped with his OED and a vastly patient ability to dig into what on the surface, given Beckett's elusive and often skeletal expressions, can be deceptively straightforward utterances.<br /><br />Markedly even among Beckett's legion of exegetes, Ricks takes time to compare the French with the English renderings, and unearths from both versions witty and insightful analyses. His energy rarely flags. He may think a bit too much of his cleverness, I suspect, but this is forgivable when we can learn so much from his recondite schtick. As these apparently originated as 1990 Clarendon lectures at Oxford, Ricks keeps aware of an audience--on the page or in person--who is following, and presumably chuckling at, his remarks. You get the sense of Ricks, as with Beckett, performing his recitals rather than transcribing them for actors or academics.<br /><br />The whole point of death and extinction in Beckett remains an often too little observed topic, and that Ricks stays pretty much on target the whole way through proves an impressive feat. The book takes in, by the way, topics germane to anyone with a general knowledge of Beckett, and is not as limited a concern as the title may suggest. Ricks' infectious interest in puns, allusions, and innuendo makes this a bonus for readers similarly afflicted. Ricks remembers that, as so much in life as well as literature, Beckett is deadly serious as he is uproariously sly.<br /><br />Doomed to lack as encyclopedic a knowledge of the Beckett canon (and who among you reading this could ever attain such a familiarity as Ricks?), still, I enjoyed this work much more than most criticism I've had to peruse, whoever the scholar or subject.  John Banville judges this book, at least from the excerpt as a back cover blurb, \\"extremely and gruesomely funny.\\"blurb, \\"extremely and gruesomely funny.\\"	2005-07-21

Galway city's center, the dockside and Corribside, the various amusements, sports, trades, dancing, and \\"picturesque\\" views all gain attention in the book's first hundred-plus pages. Few old photos pre-1900 are shown, and after the mid-20c, the coverage is a hodge-podge, going up, judging from the showbands' sartorial splendor, well past 1960 into the 1970s, despite the \\"1895-1960\\" subtitle. Docked a star for inaccuracy, thus.<br /><br />I bought this, given the book's subtitle, thinking that it'd be chock-full of Galway memorabilia, but the scope by far focuses on militaria. It does a fine job of collecting not only photos but letters, documents, and other ephemera from 1914-1918, including some horrific snapshots of the carnage from the front.<br /><br />A smaller section produces court testimony and lists those from Galway arrested for their role in the 1916 Rising, and another chapter discusses and documents Galway's role in the \\"emergency\\" of WW2, both helpful for the historian, as such data and photos outside of Dublin have not been easily found before.<br /><br />Over half of the pages, impressively packed with captions, photos, and diary and card-verse excerpts from soldiers as well as from commercially-produced items for the fighting men and those they corresponded with (and bereavement cards ready-made and versified too) deal with WWI and make for grim and moving reading nearly a century after \\"the war to end all wars.\\"	2005-07-21

Living in a Conamara gaeltacht since 1970, his adopted locale inspired him to ask two questions that impelled the saga adapted in this update (Dublin: The Lilliput Press, 2005, 20 euro) to his 1986 work, Atlantean. Bono, in an interview with Bob Dylan, cited Quinn's initial contention: tracing ancient Gaelic song to North Africa. A new edition's range of illustrations, attractive font and design, and incorporation of material gleaned from refinement and elaboration of his initial foray into largely uncharted intellectual waters presents iconoclasts with a model of how to construct an alternative to what everyone assumes to be the only way from which to perceive 'reality.'<br /><br />Looking at the p&uacute;c&aacute;n boats that once dotted his Atlantic coast, he noted their resemblance to lateen sails on Egyptian dhows; listening to sean-nos melodies, he marvelled at their pentatonic counterparts from the Arab realms. Quinn targets cultural echoes, archaeological evidence, and linguistic links tying Ireland not to the conventional La Tene-Celtic and thereafter European-centered diffusion pattern, but to a neglected nautical passage that, he reasoned, had long escaped the gaze of Continentally ethnocentric scholars fixated on an Indo-European genesis for the peoples and crafts that entered into the island. Now, Quinn's thesis contradicts the Celtic origins which many Irish have celebrated for 300 years.<br /><br />His findings, necessarily scattershot and rather random, resemble a Victorian vicar's parlour-displayed assemblage of bric-a-brac. (Only source titles, not precise citations, fill his endnotes, frustratingly.) I suppose Quinn might retort it's instead structuralist bricolage, a bold thrust to delve deeper below the psuedo-Keltic veneer appliqued by Revivalists and Romantics to excavate the broken shards and ghostly palimpsests abandoned by those who travelled the \\"wine-route\\" from as long as 5000 BCE along the Southern Mediterranean littoral, until, drawn by tin from Cornwall and smugglers to Ireland, moving up the Iberian coasts until they continued due north to the first landfall the western and southern island shores. He advances that the true impetus for Irish culture came from North African, Egyptian, and Mediterranean lands rather than Central Europe, the Roman empire, and its successors.<br /><br />Neither the ancient classical nor the native Irish authors, Quinn insists, called the indigenous people in our island 'Celts' -- this being an antiquarian and so relatively early modern coinage. In what was for me the most intriguing section of his study, he contends that North African substrata underlie our Irish language itself, and he relates the legendary accounts of the Iberian and Egyptian origins of the island's first ancestors to the migrations that would have brought trade, colonisers, refugees from early Christian persecutions, and monks to Ireland before the suspect arrival of a largely fabricated Patrick. While I lack the familiarity that Quinn has with his many sources, I wondered why, however, his use of mitochondrial DNA studies to support his claims cited Bryan Sykes (his eloquent Seven Daughters of Eve. London: 2001) of Eve, but not the concurrent team led by David Bradley from TCD, whose assertions a few years back in Science appear to complicate what Quinn simplifies about the coming of the earliest settlers from Asia Minor to Connaught thousands of years ago, Bradley's team, and other research by Brian McEvoy and colleagues at TCD, and by D.B. Goldsmith and colleagues, also depends on genetic markers still overwhelmingly present in natives to the West today. None of these researchers, active in the past decade, have been cited by Quinn, an obvious flaw.<br /><br />But maybe Quinn's stacking his evidence? Bradley's TCD team and recent geneticists argue for an Atlantic fringe origin, but from Northern Spain to Scandinavia rather thanfurther south and east. Simon James and Barry Cunliffe, among other leaders in pre-Roman Celtic-British studies, have accepted the invalidity of the \\"Celtic\\" invasion of the islands and the west thesis. Emerging challenges by linguists to the Central European genesis and Celtic invasion pattern seem to clash in their findings with Quinn's Mediterranean-African genesis for the early Irish.<br /><br />Bearing the traces of peoples pushed ever westward as farmers advanced, a kilometer or so a year, the peoples (whose genetic traits distinguished at 97% in the West of Ireland among males of native descent vs. 3% in today's Turkey) came not over water but presumably over land--driven across Europe as they were pushed ahead by agriculturalists---unsettled folks from the Fertile Crescent who were shunted ever westward as farmers ploughed Europe over thousands of years. The remnants of those pre-farmers wound up settling finally into Connacht's spaces--the last nearby refuge on the North Atlantic fringe.<br /><br />Again, certain portions of Quinn's argument, even to this general reader, appear akin to romanticised notions of solidarity with au courant Arab and Third World solidarity rather than the 'Thomas Cook model' of radial diffusion from an Alpine or Danubian homeland, favored by many 19 and 20c scholars. The evidence, as Quinn admits at times, for a maritime rather than continental dependence influencing Irish development depends far too often for academic scrutiny upon perhaps coincidental or random findings, albeit painstakingly and cleverly compiled by Quinn over three decades and more. His basic reliance upon his interpretation of Irish from its status as a living language rather than using Romanised inscriptions to re-create a Celtic tongue appears convincing, and I await further scholarship to clarify Quinn's educated guesses. Like the vicar, his collection impresses somewhat but also leaves the viewer muddle-headed as he examines many labels, evaluations, and connections between displays.<br /><br />Chapters on Wales, Vikings, and Sheela-na-Gigs sway uneasily beside steadier accounts of monastic art, mythmaking, and the pirate trade with Algiers and Morocco. The Berber-Irish parallels again smack of the type of overly enthusiastic detective fieldwork that Lorraine Evans (Kingdoms of the Ark. London: Pocket Books, 2001) presented in establishing archaeological patterns making Queen Scota of Milesian lore into the eponymous ruler over Ireland's hordes and the instigator of the British race. I enjoyed both Evans and Quinn's attempts to scour the taint of British Israelitism off of their navigational tools, and I wondered why the latter author neglected the former, but I fear that those hidebound and tenured will publish on largely unconvinced by either freelancer's revolutionary reports.<br /><br />Frustration emerges as Quinn recounts throughout his revised work the skepticism he faced from this establishment.

Like Roy Foster's massive biography of Yeats, or Anthony Cronin's on Beckett, this work gains much having been written by not only a fine scholar but a Irish writer who knows his country well and can convey it with verve and precision to a broader readership outside academia.<br /><br />This study blends the literary criticism of Murray, an authority on modern Irish drama, with a scrupulous examination incorporating details from those still living who recalled O'Casey. He supports this by a massive array of primary and secondary sources--the endnotes and bibliography amount to nearly 100 pages. Murray writes for the general reader clearly and sensitively, eschewing jargon in favor of direct, spare, and clear prose. He takes you all the way from late Victorian times to \\"the new and bland Ireland\\" of 2004, in a thoughtful chapter on the \\"afterlife' of O'Casey's current reputation, vs. that in an Ireland that had spurned him, and vice versa, for so much of the 20th century.<br /><br />With well-chosen illustrations (on the cover, a tellingly posed photo of the man at his most \\"thoughtful;\\" a colorful shot of a 2002 Abbey production on the jacket's reverse), this book presents finely-printed but well-paced text. With a careful separation of the man from the very-calculated character who wrote his notoriously \\"ornamented\\" six volumes masking as \\"Autobiographies,\\" the examiner Murray faced a daunting task. How O'Casey, as defiant Communist, served so long the cause of Stalinism, defending it even after 1956 Hungary alienated many of his colleagues, and why he sought exile in Devon and popularity in the US more than in the Ireland for which he had joined in revolt in its \\"Citizen Army\\" make for fascinating anecdotes and thoughtful insight that shows depth behind the plays of their creator. As Murray remarks, the subtitle \\"Writer at Work\\" has a triple meaning: it refers to his avocation--he only labored as a \\"working man\\" briefly; to his efforts behind which he warned off others, as he attended to his \\"work at hand,\\" and to the \\"arrogance of the disadvantaged man of talent who knows his own worth.\\"(6) His complexity and self-mythologizing turned O'Casey early on into a toiler who sought to establish a worker's utopia but to keep humanist values that, by their nature, resist authority and oppression.<br /><br />Also, you find how over his long career he kept producing dramas long after the initial punch of the Dublin trilogy about revolution, like that historical event itself, soured. Why and how Stalinism became his faith? For me, the politics of O'Casey even overpower his drama, and Murray examines both of O'Casey's passions meticulously. The reaction of critics to his work by many reviews quoted widens the context in which and for which O'Casey had to make his chosen living, adapting his romantic yet controversial yearnings into a delivery on stage palatable for a ticket-buying audience to be sustained over a lengthy career.<br /><br />This predicament makes instructive lessons for what occurs when (like Wordsworth?), one outlives one's youthful idealism but still clings to its more distant warmth and spirit over the decades ahead the young 1916 red rebel never expected he'd face.pth behind the plays of their creator.

Far less emerged from Derry; this and Eamonn McCann's \\"War and an Irish Town\\" are the two basic first-person accounts, supplemented by Peggy Deery, an \\"as told to\\" book by Nell McCafferty, and Niall O Dochartaigh's more academic study of Derry's role in the rise of the civil rights movement and the insurrection following.<br /><br />I stress the importance of Fionnbarra O Dochartaigh (who you might find in the histories by related spellings/anglicizations) as an example of the generation, also shown by such regional figures as Seamus Heaney, John Hume, and Martin McGuinness, as part of the post-WWII generation who took the Irish cause forward in various cultural, political, or activist choices made for those who sought to further the tiny gains begun by those who refused the gerrymandering and blatant discrimination foisted by the Unionists upon the city.<br /><br />O Dochartaigh's story moves between the personal and the political, NICRA and the various factions that campaigned for a peaceful progression into freedom and were only pushed towards, among some of them, more aggressive agitation after the marches had been suppressed. Although I wish he had taken his account further into the present regarding his own on-going grassroots organizing, he provides a solid context for a part of north eastern Ireland that unfortunately has been long overshadowed by its more populous larger city. Some of his reticence may be due to on-going surveillance brought upon republican activists now.<br /><br />There's welcome touches of sly humor, which enliven this rather thin, unfortunately, but essential reading for finding out more about how the city on the Foyle fared in the earlier stages of the Irish republican movement. The author was one of the first sit-in occupiers in Derry, by the way! A sequel to this narrative would be welcomed by many of us readers.many of us readers.	2005-07-19
US	53087372	RGPNAADMOK7ZY	0670033928	772270793	Europe Central	Books	3	125	144	N	N	Symphonies & tombstones	Having finished the book a few minutes ago, I must record my reactions. I spent the last few weeks in its passages--on and off, necessarily--it's an overwhelming monolith as forbidding as its 1935 \\"Deutschland, das Land der Musik\\" stylized eagle cover image. Yet, like the somber image, it attracts a certain reader curious to part the curtain and enter. This mythic structure towers over the individual, whether in the storylines or ourselves, wandering into a great labyrinth.<br /><br />The blurbs summarize the plots, but a few overall reactions may let you know if this book may be worth the considerable effort and investment of time. I was pleased to see that in the sources appended to the text, Guy Sajer's outstanding memoir (which I've also reviewed for Amazon) The Forgotten Soldier is cited first of all. This account (which has been asserted by some to take liberties with fact) of an Alsatian fighting for the Germans on the Ostfront came often to mind as I read Vollmann. The author's scope and research simply is not the type we expect to find so evidently scaffolding even \\"historical fiction,\\" and this involved me more in the result even as it distanced me from the conceit that I was listening to fully-realized narrators rather than, as Vollmann gives away in one footnote, a \\"fabulist.\\"<br /><br />The musical themes I found appropriate, but lacking knowledge of Shostakovich's ouevre, the exacting attention given to them left me floundering for long stretches of an already nearly endless work. (My wife was reading Anna Karenina simultaneously, and we kept pace with each other!) Unlike the earlier Russian writers, Vollmann's epic does not unfold so easily. Even with background knowledge of the conflicts (in no small part thanks to Sajer), the panoramas, like the Ostfront serving as the focus for so many scenes, astonish but diminish you as a reader, struggling to keep up with the events. Perhaps this reaction is intended by Vollmann as the appropriate response?<br /><br />My favorite parts were those of Kurt Gerstein, Van Cliburn, Vlasov and Paulus, and Hilde Benjamin, the GDR's \\"Red Guillotine.\\" Vollmann takes on a very intriguing narrative style imitating the leaden justifications of Soviet propagandists well for many vignettes, and his energy often seems more expended on the side of the USSR rather than the \\"German Fascist\\" entries, leaving the book a bit more lopsided than the design of paired stories would suggest. This probably, given the determinism of the Soviets as well as actual events, nonetheless may convey the force--in so many ways--of the Russian over the German ideology in the struggle for Europe Central--which tends to get overlooked, actually, in the novel in favor of the Russian steppes.<br /><br />If you're somewhat familiar with the contexts already, this is in my opinion a fitting and challenging work that will force you to enter into the minds of people that you may have only glimpsed at a distance in grainy documentaries--this itself serves as one of many motifs--the humanity is less directly perceived than in more accessible, sentimentalized, or tidy novels.<br /><br />Yes, the work needed an editor. A lesser author would have ironically earned another star! But a writer as intelligent as Vollmann should know that he needs to keep his reader in mind, and not expect us to labor for so long on what his labor needs to compress into a more comprehensible form. The Shostakovich-Elena-Karman triangle makes its point and encapsulates the question of \\"can art fight evil\\" well. But it goes on three times longer than needed in an already stuffed narrative that needed more concentration upon, say Zoya. The ties with the Nibelungenlied, Tristan, and the Germanic myth are excellent, but I think these could have been tightened and honed. You also sense that Stalingrad, Dresden, the gulags and lagers all are filtered through book-learning.  Vollmann for all his impressive research tends to let it sit on the page as \\"facts that need to be made into fiction to make it a WWII story\\" rather than to incorporate what's been published as memoirs and first-hand interviews, say, into vividly rendered experiences transferred into the plight of his imagined protagonists.<br /><br />For many authors, this would have been the work of a lifetime. For this prolific if admittedly prolix writer, (most of whose books I've gone on to review in late 2013/first half of 2014) it's an immersion that seems to have been, more or less effectively in parts rather than the whole--within who knows what shorter time. And what's Vollmann getting at in blaming \\"wartime paper shortages\\" for the lack of the supplement's chronology? Perhaps a sly relevance for us today?facts that need to be made into fiction to make it a WWII story\\" rather than to incorporate what's been published as memoirs and first-hand interviews, say, into vividly rendered experiences transferred into the plight of his imagined protagonists.<br /><br />For many authors, this would have been the work of a lifetime.

For a very young writer (born 1977), such acclaim as this slim volume has garnered shows that the power of the MFA and creative writing industry is driving what in earlier decades would have been energy more often harnessed and directed in isolation, perhaps with a few friends or mentors, but not dozens.<br /><br />This fussiness lessens the power of these stories, the highlights of which have been summarized on Amazon. A knowledge of the bombing of La Frontera prison, of the Sendero terrorism that focused upon symbolic (dog hangings) and practical (power blackouts of the cities) actions, and of the devastating avalanche of 1970 heightens the contexts that Alarcon includes, but with the exception of the ambitious, if obvious in its motifs and themes, long story \\"City of Clowns,\\" little feel for Lima emerges.<br /><br />Instead, it's largely the same often self-pitying, well-worn, psychological terrain inhabited by so many contemporaries of Alarcon, who, given his bicultural and bilingual knowledge, should not settle so easily into. Rather, the flashes of insight evident as he sketches the emotional impact of exile, of alienation, and of resentment show more depth when juxtaposed against urban landscapes he apparently favors: New York City as well as Arequipa.<br /><br />P.S. The subsequent Spanish translation, intriguingly, was not done by Daniel but by Renato Alarcon, evidently another family member, as \\"Guerra en la penumbra.\\"	2005-07-06

This novel takes on indirectly (as in his more recent \\"A Long, Long Way From Home\\") Barry's own family's experience as Irish divided between serving the British and aiding those who rebelled against the King. The other reviewers here cover much of the plot, but I might add that a touch of magic realism near the explosive climax makes for a nice touch, and the tension between truth-telling and perceived loyalty moves the story of the modern-day Aeneas along his wanderings efficiently and poignantly.<br /><br />Barry, also a poet and best known--at least before this novel--as a playwright, brings to his fictional characters a narrative style somewhat at odds with what one might expect. He's not Joyce, that is, striving for a correlative voice to match his character's interior musings. Rather, he takes the rich legacy of Joyce and makes it impel his own telling of the interior life of those that Barry finds empathy with, and whose inner as well as outer itineraries this author feels, you sense, he must tell. This impelling of a writer to find release through his creations makes for a very effective novel, indeed.	2005-06-23
US	53087372	R1DAEOADFNN1C5	0312316453	276106325	The Magdalen Martyrs (Jack Taylor Series)	Books	4	14	15	N	N	In times of stress, he recalls passages from books he read	With such a diagnosis, who couldn't (at least if you're reading these reviews) connect with Jack Taylor? The third in the series finds Bruen a bit more relaxed, if you can say that about a man creating not only the drug-addled (see novel #2) but back to booze (novel #1) protagonist out on another mission in which again packets of cash come his way almost serendipitously to allow him to fund his ramshackle and lackadaisacal vocation. I'm pleased to find only two errors this time out. The first would likely be lost to a non-Irish reader: Mount Melleray gets misspelled--I remember Joyce's characters discussing it as a dry-out facility, and was surprised this wasn't added to Jack's reverie on the site. The second only a Galwegian might catch: Scoil \\"Fhursa\\" gets garbled into the phonetically proper but orthographically flawed \\"Ursa,\\" unless it's a Latin-Gaelic pun.<br /><br />As for the plot, why does Harriet Klausner keep calling these \\"British\\" noir? It's again a Galway story, and added to the characters this time out is an appealing foil, the ban garda (policewoman) Brid Nic an Iomaire, who Jack takes down a peg by calling her by the ugly anglicized rendering of her surname, \\"Ridge.\\" Cliched set-ups: this time Jack falling in bed at every chance with the mum of his latest employer--again balance against raw accounts of being down and out, chemically speaking.<br /><br />Yuppified, tourist-trampled, and \\"refugee\\"-ridden old/new Galway again provides the atmosphere, at turns oppressive and cleansing. Few natives of the city survive. The \\"drinking school\\" at Eyre Square grows. Characters manage to cover long swathes of the admittedly compact city center seemingly instantly, but like any writer I suppose Bruen cuts to the chase when necessary. Miss Bailey, the sentry, and Supt. Clancy endure. I miss Keegan, but Brendan and Bill return again, and their predicaments impel much of the plot. Cathy seems to be fading away, and Jeff continues as an unevenly drawn confessor figure. Why Jack hates his mum so remains for me too ambiguous, but two earlier relationships left disappointingly vague in \\"The Killing\\" get a bit of welcome clarification, however briefly, as Jack recalls Kiki and Laura in a moment of self-incrimination to account for his past treatment of these two former loves.<br /><br />While it's hard to believe that even a doped-up Jack would choose both the lacerating honesty of Thomas Merton and the hokey claptrap of Khalil Gibran for comfort, the allusions continue, mostly not for no apparent reason! I did find this time around the vignettes of the Magdalen victims moving and a welcome change from the totally first-person style of Bruen's two earlier Taylor books. They avoid sentimentality and preachiness, while still conveying the horror perpetrated upon those women.<br /><br />The Church comes in for a hard time in this work, at least from the Franciscans who keep circling Jack, and of course Fr.

Why Jack hates his mum so remains for me too ambiguous, but two earlier relationships left disappointingly vague in \\"The Killing\\" get a bit of welcome clarification, however briefly, as Jack recalls Kiki and Laura in a moment of self-incrimination to account for his past treatment of these two former loves.  <br /> <br />While it's hard to believe that even a doped-up Jack would choose both the lacerating honesty of Thomas Merton and the hokey claptrap of Khalil Gibran for comfort, the allusions continue, mostly not for no apparent reason! I did find this time around the vignettes of the Magdalen victims moving and a welcome change from the totally first-person style of Bruen's two earlier Taylor books. They avoid sentimentality and preachiness, while still conveying the horror perpetrated upon those women.  <br /> <br />The Church comes in for a hard time in this work, at least from the Franciscans who keep circling Jack, and of course Fr. Malachy, but the entry of the doppelgangers Fr. Tom and Danny Flynn represent an appealingly disorienting couple of unsettling interlocuters.

But many of the examples gathered here fail to do much for his cause. The contents give no indication of what the essays are about, so I skimmed each before deciding to commit myself to the most promising. Here's the results from those.<br /><br />Elissa Schappell's \\"Sex & the Single Squirrel\\" plunges into the world of \\"furries\\" and \\"plushies,\\" who gain camaraderie and stimulation from fetishizing stuffed animals, dress up in such apparel themselves, and/or imagine themselves to be animals. Certainly a ripe topic, but Schappell goes on too long and arrives at little worthwhile, in a entertaining but rambling narrative. Being an Eno fan, I found Rick Moody's \\"Fractal Love of Brian Eno\\" pointless. Eliot Weinberger's \\"The Laughing Fish\\" tries to make a point about the incongruity of the title image; at least it's brief. Katie Roiphe's \\"Graham Greene's Vietnam can be summed up as more of the same that the era of \\"The Quiet American\\" found, and at least it's well-written and sensitive to what she finds in today's Southeast Asian tourist haunts.<br /><br />Russell Banks' \\"No, But I Saw the Movie\\" takes a rarely covered subject: how a novelist reacts to two of his works becoming indie movies. Especially if you have seen/read his \\"Affliction\\" or \\"The Sweet Hereafter,\\" it tells of the pros/cons of the translation process from page to film effectively. David Shields' long meditation on Bill Murray likewise shows care and long thinking about his subject, and another fine essay appears. But that's it for the 26 contenders. Not the greatest ratio of hits to strikeouts. Six up to plate, three homers.<br /><br />I was pleased to read the few above that made a worthwhile investment of my time, but having checked this out from the library, I'm just as happy that I did not pay for this volume.or this volume.	2005-06-22

From what I understand, Barry himself comes from a family similar to those of which he describes in both novels, divided between serving the Crown and rebelling against it, and such tensions permeate also his fine drama.<br /><br />Willie Dunne's story, as one of the dwindling, by 1918, 16th Royal Dublin Fusiliers, can be emblematic of all those southern Irishmen who fought for what they confusedly supposed would be a cause that would attain not only British victory and the salvation of Belgium against the Hun, but Home Rule for their island nation. While the pace does sag in parts due to the dreariness of the protracted trench life that Willie must endure, Barry labours mightily to keep a light touch upon a heavy subject, and his depictions of the sights that Willie and millions of others saw effectively keep a reader's interest, even if there is not much of a plot other than the boredom of a common soldier for long stretches at a time. In parts that may be a bit confusing for those without knowledge of Irish nationalism, Barry, for the uninitiated, blends the complicated Easter rebellion against the English in 1916, the Ulster contigent, Redmond, and what became known rather inaccurately as the \\"Sinn Feiners\\" into his tale of Willie, mostly in the trenches for most of four years, sometimes on leave as short as to a French bordello, longer to field and soldiers' hospitals, and then home to Dublin--once to be summoned as he is going back to Flanders off the ship to fight against his fellow Irishmen in his hometown's streets. His confidant, Fr Buckley, gains exceptional resonance as one who has elected to take on the spiritual and mental burdens alongside the men in the trenches.<br /><br />The tone of the omniscient style Barry selects, as in \\"Whereabouts,\\" approaches near-biblical cadences and its sensitivity and literacy jars against the more earthbound nature of the less eloquent Tommie's struggle. Still, Dostoevsky's \\"The Idiot\\" is one of the most popular reads shared among the entrenched, and the level of reading that even the average private may have attained makes for a thoughtful observation, given the large number of memoirists, poets, and novelists who reported on this awful four years.<br /><br />This disjunction, in fact, works effectively to heighten the breach between the longing the inarticulate soul keeps within the most physical and expletive-laden of moments, and the terror and wonder that coincide or juxtapose on the battlefield, when months of pent-up tedium collide with moments of terror. And when the fog of war is man-made as well as natural, all the more cruel become the grey vistas the soldiers slog and gaze across.<br /><br />Barry's best in descriptions that strain to make new scenes out of all too familiar settings. Out of dozens of examples, here's three: \\"It was line officers only that knew the drear paintings and the atrocious music of the front line.\\" (146) \\"There was no town or village on the anatomy of the human body--if the body could be considered a country--that had not tried the experiment of a bullet entering there.\\" (171)  \\"The poor lads of the Royal Army Medical Corps, stripped to the waist, hauled down those morsels of humanity away if they were still breathing and gabbing and praying. The remnants were left to decorate the way. Hands, legs, heads, chests, all kicked over to the side of the road, half sunk in the destitute mud. And front ends of horses and horses' heads sunk in with filthy foams of maggots and that violent smell; horses that looked even in death faithful and soft.\\" (231) For comparison, a graphic novel, \\"Charley's War,\\" about a WWI soldier and his horse, has just been published and would make a fine comparison. A more scholarly counterpart to Willie's letters could be \\"The Moynihan Brothers in Peace and War 1909-1918,\\" (Irish Academic Press, 2004) in which two Kerrymen exchange correspondence; one brother's service on the front almost exactly overlaps that of Willie Dunne's.<br /><br />Speaking of books, Barry appends a brief list of the recently growing shelf of books devoted to the long-taboo subject of Irish involvement in the Great War. His research is evident but never overwhelms the limited but representative experience of Willie. Coolies from China, Algerians, Africans join the Europeans and their descendants in this world conflict, and the fruits of such globalisation mobilised for the first time culminate in one of the most poetic and horrifying vignettes I have ever read.

On its own, \\"Killing\\" advances Jack's saga, nimbly expanding some of his (and my) favourite minor characters from take one: unctuous Fr Malachy, the wry \\"sentry\\" at the bar stool, and porcine Supt. Clancy. The welcome new additions of blustery Keegan and menacing Fred offset the rather flat Jeff & Catherine match this time around. The minor characters' shared understatement and maudlin sourness establishes neatly and laconically their inimitable Irishness. This is not to say Bruen falls into cliche, quite the contrary.<br /><br />What suffers after pitting this newcomer against Jack's first case are too many similarities. I cannot divulge specifics as they spoil the plot, but there were repetitions in suspects, crimes, and investigatory procedures (often involving tossing money at Jack's contacts and having them suss out, off the pages, key evidence for Jack to bring to his paying customer) that made much of this novel rather feel casually spun off rather than intricately plotted. Now, some indirection, given the purported motivation of finding out about the \\"tinkers\\" deaths despite the \\"clans\\" propensity for secrecy makes the comparative lack of detail about this subculture acceptable. But, even more than in \\"The Guards,\\" the sense of lives lost behind the list of the four murdered travellers that Jack must try to solve appears too evanescent. One powerful vignette of a travellers' camp destroyed by hostile elements among the settled folks recalls real events at Rahoon that occurred in past decades. Still, the whole \\"tinker\\" element remains largely overshadowed by more immediate skulduggery for most of the story--even the decapitation of swans!<br /><br />I was also let down by the puzzling Kiki, who seems to come and go with little reason except as a reason to define metaphysics and provide the obliquely prepared for motivation for her walking out on Jack in one pub scene. Laura, notably, seems not to deserve the fate she meets, and why Jack's attitude towards her is such may be blamed on his coke habit, for little logic can be culled from his actions towards her, given her demonstrative loyalty to him. Since Bruen via Jack's tender perspective is wise to the gentle-yet-cutting manner of Irish women when it comes to Mrs. Bailey, why this perspicacity fails to transfer to the island's younger and impressively willing women confused me as well as Jack's major antagonist this time around.<br /><br />If I had read this and \\"The Guards\\" had never surfaced, it'd gain a higher rating, and my three stars do not diminish Bruen's passion and care for his city and its denizens. I care along with the author and his fictional creations about the scenes he narrates. But with even the same Merton quote repeating again in this sequel (although I was pleased to find Beckett twice!), I feel Bruen's coasting rather than accelerating.ms to come and go with little reason except as a reason to define metaphysics and provide the obliquely prepared for motivation for her walking out on Jack in one pub scene.

In short tales like \\"The Golden Honeymoon\\" and \\"You Know Me, Al,\\" Lardner managed to convey the viewpoint of upper middle class strivers who in first-person narratives let on more about themselves and thier desperation in Middle America than the speakers realized. For Klam, the 1990s, like the 1920s, show bumptious go-getters elbowing aside the sorts who Klam focuses upon here. Five of the six stories are first-person. Other reviewers tell of their highlights.<br /><br />What I add to the other comments is that, yes, Klam's range is limited, but for a first collection, the stories are more subtle beneath their often self-deprecating gallows humor. Here the men who would've been hustlers on the sales floor in Lardner's time, the Rotarians and the golfers. Now, they are the guys who probably were frat boys at college, on their own a decade or more later, all with \\"relationship baggage,\\" all in what often are serial partnerships with women who they shy from committing to, for once the (pre-marital, unlike the 20s) honeymoon fades, the meaning of their often cluttered, materialist, and vapid lives hits home and hard. Klam uses metaphor sparingly, taking pains to give what over 200 pages may seem too same a tone, but one that I believe accurately conveys a vocabulary and consciousness of society's ambitious but conflicted latest entrants into the rat race and approaching middle age.<br /><br />Klam in the last story, \\"European Honeymoon,\\" strives for multiple characters and a third-person stance that is a bit more clumsy, but tries to make a bigger \\"statement\\" than the more attention getting tales like \\"Sam\\" and \\"Issues\\", as marriage loomos over its characters as well as Alsace's past history and the loss of connection in post-war Europe and America among a family. I look forward to reading more of him, and I hope that he does not burn brightly and flame too quickly like, say, Fitzgerald from the same 20's!, Fitzgerald from the same 20's!	2005-06-18

I wanted to add, as a Galwegian once-removed, that Bruen captures well the transition of his hometown from a 1950s overgrown and decaying village into today's bustling tourist trap, gentrifying, selfish, and greedy. Like much of contemporary Irish life, the values of the past, however limited and blinkered they were, have collapsed and only a few like Jack Taylor uphold, on his better days and especially when he can back up his better nature with a bit of cash to share with those worse off than he (which is saying a lot)some humanistic generousity.<br /><br />Bruen, interviewed on a website devoted to his works, has spoken of his wish to portray this secularising, grasping, and yuppified cityscape, and how it collides with those left on its remodelled streets in the gutter and at the barstool, too fragile to keep pace with a world around them that's too suddenly changed for not the better, despite the economic boom. All of this context comes very sparingly in this novel, and even the gardai to which the title's given over gain barely a supporting cast role. Jack's tale, unlike the cover blurb that links Elmore Leonard to James Joyce, by contrast takes nothing from the Irish forebear that for all his genius and ego has overshadowed those (like Bruen) who labour in his wake.<br /><br />Instead, I would place Beckett as the true inspiration. After I had sensed this in The Guards, I found the author verifying Sam as one of his influences. The spare, bitter, yet somehow life-affirming and defiantly tender nature of Jack and those with whom he struggles to bond makes this book stick in my memory. I do not read \\"crime fiction\\" normally, but a desire to read about Galway today makes this, the first in a series that is nearing the half-dozen mark (abroad; American publication lags and has just reached three at the time of my post), valuable not only for its first-person testimony to a changing city, but for depths of honesty and humanity that lurk subtly under self-lacerating and chemically-altered surfaces.of my post), valuable not only for its first-person testimony to a changing city, but for depths of honesty and humanity that lurk subtly under self-lacerating and chemically-altered surfaces.	2005-06-18

Part of the account's interest is that much of it takes place in a smaller town, outside of Prague. This attention to details of life beyond the narrow perspective adopted by most non-Czech chroniclers makes it a valuable, if rather rambling, narrative. Czech-American Novak and his family go back for a year to what was still then, but not for long, Czechoslovakia, and the tensions that split the nation receive attention here. There was not as much on his family as would be expected, and I recall a lot that at the time intrigued me about wheeling and dealing in the black market trade that has kept so many Czechs solvent despite often officially precarious economic regimes, pre-and post-Wall.<br /><br />It's an entertaining read, certainly more digestible than sociological treatises about average life there, and I found it conveys a mix of personal observation and cultural summation effectively. It should be better known than it is, for it seems never to appear in bibliographies for English-speakers who wish to find out more about the Czech lands beyond the capital city.	2005-06-13

Books	5	21	23	N	Y	"A faithless lover's letter of apology" for this city	John Banville, in many of his novels, conjures up the alchemical and scientific wonders of early modern Europe: Copernicus, Kepler, Newton, Dr Faustus. His prose always has daunted me from taking on his dense, serious fiction, but perhaps, after this wonderfully self-deprecating, nimbly observed, and precisely rendered collection of thoughts inspired by events and people in Prague, I will try his novels! As Banville prefaces this small but pleasingly compacted assemblage of ruminations, it is not a guidebook but (my words) a momento urbi, a reminder of this city.<br /><br />He avoids post-Wall sightseeing (contrast Myla Goldberg's Time's Magpie), limits his Kafka citations wisely (compare nearly any other journalist!), and steers clear from tiresome dynastic recitals (unlike Peter Demetz' City of Black & Gold). Out of his travels there, starting in 1975, he instead opts to build slightly interrelated essays. The first, \\"Sudek's City,\\" tells of the Professor and Marta, who show him and his companions prints by Josef Sudek, a photographer (two of which I presume grace this book's covers), who reveals tangibly yet tangentially the post-war era. Banville links the dislocation of the jet-lagged traveller in the hotel room with the wider struggle by a people to overcome alienation in their home city, yet such connections are left subtle, for us to tie together. The description in a page or so of the Professor, who himself threatens to become effaced after so many decades of having to blend in to such surroundings, is one of the most powerful depictions in print I have ever read of summing up another human in a few well-chosen words.<br /><br />\\"Threshold,\\" from which the name for Prague was derived, merges the background on the city with its monuments, even as Banville insists that they do not make Prague what it is, this essence too elusive. Fittingly, such fluidity blends into an account of Rudolf and the intellectual climate that lured some of Europe's most creative minds in the later 16th c. to study magic, astronomy, the occult, and the rational, or mixes thereof.<br /><br />\\"The Prague Orgy\\", while never mentioning Philip Roth, starts with Banville's teenaged longing for a minor Czech actress, Eva Bartok, and his longing for such dark beauties, often with (sans makeup!) pale plum-hued shadows under their eyes. He segues into his friend Phil who boasts of \\"The Company,\\" the Havel era, the \\"putative parents\\" of his hostess at a doomed dinner party, to conclude, paraphrasing another Philip (Larkin) that \\"nothing, like something, can happen anywhere. Banville again evokes psychological dislocation marvellously, keeping control of his shifting scenes while hiding from we his readers his manipulative strings. He's too good a writer to let his craft show so nakedly.<br /><br />From one who wrote a novel called \\"Kepler,\\" the chapter \\"Great Dane, Little Dog\\" relates the long story of Tycho Brahe, his unfortunate death for the sake of royal etiquette, and his somewhat unwilling apprentice Johannes Kepler. Prague itself fades a bit even more than in the rest of the book, but Banville keeps the tale engaging. I found this segment of the volume readable, but since I do not share Banville's obvious love of this period, its comparative detachment from the city itself made it too tangential. On a related note, he incorporates references to a far more obsessive text, Angelo Maria Ripellino's \\"Magic Prague,\\" nicely into his volume, so you feel you get the gist of that admittedly appealing but immensely detailed study without all of its laborious asides. Their common concentration on the hermetic, the mathematical, and the malcontent does show why Prague thrived as an asylum and a laboratory for so many ambitious quacks, mad scientists, and rogues.<br /><br />\\"Snapshots\\" takes Banville out of Prague to Bratislava, but not for the sights. He conveys here being out of place as a modern intellectual at a conference where his ignorance (so he assumes, though we readers might disagree) his unmasked before the restless native audience. The tale of an old communist, Goldstucker, and the saga of the Golem and the Jewish ghetto is recounted to sum up the condition of the latter-day dreamers and thinkers in a more recent regime that reigned over the Castle.<br /><br />Finally, in two brief codas, \\"The Deluge\\" tells of the 2002 summer floods, with a marvelously apt quote from Eliot's \\"Four Quartets,\\" and \\"After-Images\\" leaves us with Banville's fading scenes from his Prague travels. A short bibliography adds to the value of this short but elegant and never predictable meditation.<br /><br />Pg. 83 sums up his motif for this volume, except for its covers devoid of visual \\"pictures\\" that rather he brings out of his mind's eye into our receptive faculty: \\"These are the things we remember. It as if we were to focus our cameras on the great sights and the snaps when developed all came out with nothing in them save undistinguished but manically detailed foregrounds.\\" The unreliable and capricious state of memory, then, is Banville's true souvenir that he shares with us from this city.so he assumes, though we readers might disagree) his unmasked before the restless native audience.

Such conflicts, certainly, dominate the history of Catholicism ever since.<br /><br />MacCulloch asserts that much of his study investigates theological rather than political, cultural, or historical elements per se. He makes us, far removed for the majority of us from such contentions as were fought over five centuries ago, understand how much passion as well as cogitation made figures like Erasmus, Luther, and Zwingli determined to create a better church promoting the people over the institution.<br /><br />The author avoids easy stereotypes and devotes less attention than I would've expected to matters such as the sale of indulgences or the \\"peasants'\\" revolt. Catastrophic wars often earn but a few seconds of his attention compared to justification by faith, for example. And Luther's rather puzzling insistence to recognize earlier in his revolt the presence of the body and blood in bread and wine receives less than clear explication by MacCulloch. You get the impression either Luther was foggy on the notion or that MacCulloch assumes we readers know more than most of us do about the nuances of Luther's position, which eluded me, I confess.<br /><br />The feel of the later medieval times dominates the beginning of this work, and while my own limited field of expertise gained only a few pages in this massive work, I sought out what MacCulloch had to say about ideas of purgatory and found to my pleasure that--on this spot-check of sorts--that his approach was up-to-date on the scholarship, his sources varied and new to me, and his incorporation of the few pages on this topic were clearly presented.<br /><br />This book does not move quickly. I found I had to give it close attention to follow often intricate arguments and densely related material. This is not a criticism of MacCulloch. But the blurbs tend to present it as a lively page-turner, which it is not. It largely eschews jargon, but it does demand intellectual and theological familiarity with the period, to say the least. Understandably, it will serve as the one-volume summation on this period, but perhaps it's beyond the grasp or concentration of those non-experts wishing for a more concise introduction./>This book does not move quickly.

She combines her own interviews and reading with reflections upon how \\"gypsies\\" and Jews coexist and play off each other's stereotypes in the eyes of the dominant culture that illuminate from her own perspective (her mother's Jewish) how marginalized peoples have to survive often on the less respectable fringes of a world that both inflates and diminishes the power of \\"the Other.\\" Especially revealing is her exploration of \\"the Devouring,\\" the Roma cataclysm during WWII.<br /><br />Others have commented on the fact that she only delves in-depth into one Albanian family, and I agree that this concentration lessens the impact of the rest of her book, which follows in a more general survey Roma in Bulgaria, Romania, Germany with glimpses in the Czech lands, Poland, and the Balkans. She refers to other \\"gypsies\\" in the West and India, and I realize that publication pressures may have limited her ability to give all the detail she may have wanted to, or, on the other hand, that she chose a few representative places and events to stand for the whole panorama.<br /><br />But, I did feel that she sensed an exhaustion of the topic by the last chapter, a weary recounting of conferences and rather fruitless statements of purpose by \\"professional Gypsies\\" and the academic and public policy specialists who follow the Roma. She writes from an American identity but her prose uses Britishisms to arrive at an expat, mid-Atlantic style that makes her seem more detached from her subject than she may have meant. (Perhaps the influence of her now-partner, Martin Amis, in assistance when she worked on this book can partially account for this stylistic tic?) While Fonseca has done her reading and strives mightily at giving us an popularized introduction to the Roma, her chapters vary widely in interest and verve, and the book took me much longer to read as a result.<br /><br />Lively depictions of a train trip from Poland to Germany vie with desultory recitals of conversations with countless individuals who have little of interest to relate. Careful crafting of her sentences collides with boilerplate renderings of findings reminiscent of anthropological term papers.

US	53087372	R1EAOPFZ6MN89P	0060196742	43859328	A Changed Man: A Novel	Books	3	1	4	N	N	Uneven latter third, but worthwhile and thoughtful	When Prose starts with a quote from Middlemarch and references to Dickens' Mrs Jellaby from Bleak House and her \\"telescopic philanthropy,\\" you can see that she's aiming at a serious, yet readable, survey of mores in the style of these distinguished forebears. She pulls off a quickly paced, yet nuanced, look into the minds and hearts of the various characters that other reviewers have listed. Up until around the entrance of the antagonist about halfway into the pages, the book captures your attention and keeps it realistically skeptical, as Prose filters a streetwise sass as she takes us via a light but sustained indirect narrative style (as Joyce did in Dubliners) through the reactions of Bonnie, Vincent, Irene, Danny, and later Maslow. I admire any novelist these days able to convincingly adapt this challenging method, and I found that it rang true.<br /><br />What's best, then, about this work is how you see that change does not come overnight, but gradually, with backsliding and mental grooves that prevent the best-intentioned of us from getting out of ruts due to years of habitual attitudes. Prose delves into Vincent's mind in this way the most, but she does not spare the other characters mentioned from similar scrutiny. In this satire and meditation on morality, therefore, we can see ourselves also put under the magnifying glass.<br /><br />So, why three stars (more like 3 1/2)? The latter third of the novel was driven more by a potboiler page-turning acceleration of action that left, until the remarkably graceful recovery at the very end of the work, me rather disappointed in its predictability. The character Prose introduces lacks, in the interior monologue conveyed, the verisimilitude of the previous characters. This character seems to have been assembled from visits to websites rather than drawn from life, and the flatness may be intentional compared to the more in-depth portrayals earlier established, but this latter figure makes a very weak foil to parry against the stronger characters Prose has built up.<br /><br />The ethical ending, I admit, does show Prose is able to keep control of the resolution that closes this novel's action, but the loss of momentum even as the plot quickens in most of Part Three shows, as in her Blue Angel, that for now, Prose's ideas still remain more engaging in these two novels than her ability to animate a novel over four-hundred pages with her imagination.parry against the stronger characters Prose has built up. <br /> <br />The ethical ending, I admit, does show Prose is able to keep control of the resolution that closes this novel's action, but the loss of momentum even as the plot quickens in most of Part Three shows, as in her Blue Angel, that for now, Prose's ideas still remain more engaging in these two novels than her ability to animate a novel over four-hundred pages with her imagination.	2005-05-25

This is not meant to damn with faint praise, simply to note that consistency of Durcan's critiques of Catholic institutional/hierarchical hypocrisy, Anglo-American (with emphasis on the latter, which is only fair) consumer culture, and how globalisation threatens the humanistic values for which Durcan has laboured so long to champion as one of the cultural harbingers of a newly secularised Ireland continues here.<br /><br />He confronts the dying of his mother, the republican legacy as inherited from her and the MacBrides and all the illustrious forebears vs. its hijacking by Gerry Adams and his cabal, and the resultant cynicism permeating the \\"peace process\\" boldly and eloquently. This makes for by far the best entry of his collection here. John Moriarty, a philosopher Durcan ranks among the most eloquent of the past century, is reviewed via JM's Nostos, and Durcan's enthusiasm makes me want to reconsider an author I've shied away from as too recondite--a fine example of how an informed response can cause one to look anew at an author one has avoided! Durcan intriguingly compares Moriarty not only to his student John O'Donaghue (of Anam Cara acclaim) but to the entrepreneur Tony O'Reilly as two of the best students at UCD at the time! For any reader cognisant of Irish current affairs, this juxtaposition is bracing. Pieces on travellers, Sean MacBride, an hair-raising airplane ride with Charlie Haughey, and his granddaughter Rosie Joyce work well enough, concentrating upon the local, the particular, and the personal. Many others are mediocre, like those on the new wing of the National Gallery facing Clare st in Dublin--name-dropping obscures what the art museum actually looks like and displays. For a parochial RTE audience, as it often is in a small country, this familiarity may be forgiven, but on the page it smacks of nepotism and fawning to his social class' designated \\"superiors,\\" alas. Durcan repeatedly speaks here of living in a storage facility-cum-cave in Ringsend near the Liffey industrial docks, and I wondered how this squared with the hob-nobbing, poetry readings abroad, and jet-set itineraries his entries elsewhere document.<br /><br />Compared to the like of entries like \\"Osama Bin Bush, \\"Camp X-Ray\\" (on Guatanamo Bay) and the invasion of Iraq, well, you don't have to disagree with Durcan to find this level of discourse rather puerile, self-satisfied, and predictably smug. Durcan does take on Dublin's Cardinal Connell with a sense of heartfelt pain at how the Church has turned in upon itself away from a changing Ireland--and one that I hold that Durcan's influence in no small way managed to shift away from the priest-ridden stereotype--and his honesty here at how one Catholic manages to practice at one level a faith he clings to even as its shrouded carapace repulses him makes for clumsy if genuine reading. But Durcan's clumsy attacks on Bush and the American hegemony make you cringe for a better editor and an wish that Durcan would edit before he speaks on the radio the scripts here printed. He will win no new converts with such blather, and its superficiality diminishes what in other places that I've highlighted in this January 2001-April 2003 collection of 39 talks manages to rise above the mundane, the predictable, or the patronising voice.ks of nepotism and fawning to his social class' designated \\"superiors,\\" alas.

The twist, however, is the ghostwriting angle that Buarque inserts into a by now familiar plot, at least for anyone whose read experimental fiction of the past sixty or seventy years. Actually, I expected more of the Budapest sections, but much of this read takes place in Brasil. A dislocation that the cover art, reversing Rio and Budapest's tourist attractions with their pictorial referents, wittily prepares us for. The allure of alienation, of wishing to immerse ourselves into another tongue and place, comes out beautifully in the narrator's wish to wake up in a locale where he speaks a language everybody understands but himself!<br /><br />The characters he engages with, his wife Vanda, his stepson Joachim, his lover Kriska, her son Pisti, along with Costa's unctuous partner Alvaro and his antagonist of sorts Kasper Krabbe, make for entertaining if at times puzzling antagonists. Buarque wishes apparently to obliquely introduce and manipulate his supporting cast so they appear as elusive as, well, those with whom we come into contact in our everyday world. The combination of the surreal and the quotidian makes here for a satisfying, if somewhat predictable in its climax and resolution, story.	2005-05-13

His energetic style rushes past dazzling insights that only later cause you to pause and then question them more thoroughly, in retrospect. By then, Diamond's long ahead of you, on to yet another byway along his intellectual marathon. You never can catch up with his pace.<br /><br />Such aplomb can be found in his earlier collection, which suffers a bit by comparison. It lacks the unity that linked GGS. You can find his \\"later\\" ideas published in the next decade and more here percolating--\\"Accidental Conquerors\\" the raw material for GGS; part five \\"Reversing Our Progress Overnight\\" anticipating \\"Collapse.\\" Without exception, the length of these essays, individually often full of intriguing anecdotes, remains constant. They satisify with analogies as disparate as a Mercedes dealer, a relative from the Holocaust, his toddler's vocabulary, and how bowerbirds' love shacks compare with dating rituals on the Sunset Strip.<br /><br />Their origins in Discover and Natural History magazines reveal also their limitations. Compressing complex theories into a small space for a broad audience is Diamond's admirable skill. Yet, he raises more questions than he can answer. This open-ended approach perhaps stems from his style of lecturing, but on paper it leaves the reader less satisfied than his listeners, I sense. I learned much from each disparate essay, but I never reached the conclusion without feeling a bit shortchanged. His annotated bibliographies document the breadth and depth of his research, and I have nothing but praise for his abilities. Yet, I find in his more unified later publications a more cohesive, if equally debatable, presentation of his very fertile intelligence.	2005-05-06

She enters Nan's tales delicately, bringing you as a reader in and out of Nan's anecdotes occasionally before taking again the thread of her long and detailed recollections of a life spent largely outside the confines of city life, but, it is to be noted, increasingly becoming settled within the urban life that takes over for millions of Irish in the latter part of the 20th c., from whatever rural background or tradition.<br /><br />The highlights of this account I found were in her service for Major Evans at Gretton House in Northants. In this quintessentially British country home, she worked her way up from being a kitchen maid, and her vignettes capture movingly her ability to, being illiterate, to live by her wits. Her subsequent return to Ireland, one senses, was not wished for, even though it brought her back to her traveller lifestyle. For her childhood, as with too many of her own 18 children, she shows how elastic the bonds are between parents and offspring (despite the often asserted claim that for travellers family ties come first), as some of her own children found themselves sent off to institutions to be raised.<br /><br />The most intriguing section next was how she met her match in trying to survive as a totally untutored fortune-teller in 1940s Conamara, since she could only barter her wares rather than be paid for them from women as poor as she was! After that, the weariness of surviving wears her down into a much older-looking woman than she was when Gmelch met her in the 1970s. Abusive husbands, unending pregnancies, exhausting hustles, and life spent on the road or in substandard housing left her wiped out.<br /><br />Drink and violence--at one point she casually gives as an aside the fact her husband broke her nose--belie the carefree proto-hippie romanticism that rose-tinted a harsh, gray, and lonely life.

Her \\"Nan\\" relates the stories of Nan Donaghue, who in T&T is quoted often; his study of urbanisation among the \\"tinkers\\" relies more on theory. In this short book, they collaborate: she writes an cogent and concise overview of the travellers' possible origins, their traditional lifestyle, songs, their crafts, and how technology has forced them to adapt to living less in the country and more by the city to survive, not always by honest means. One of the best parts is her recorded dialogue enacted (deadpan? uproariously?) by two travellers themselves, one as the \\"buffer\\" or citified non-Traveller rebuffing the hyperbolic begging script followed doggedly by the traveller playing the twenty-year-old starving mum with five children to feed.<br /><br />Gmelch subtly observes too how stereotypes of the settled people play into the increasingly dishevelled and strained pleas of the begging travellers and their babies (or props stuffed into shawls), for who--after all--gains the most coins from passers-by? It'd be interesting to compare their position in the mid-70s to the multinational denizens found on many Irish city and small town streets today. I wish the text was a bit more detailed, but the publishers aim for a popular overview, not an in-depth scholarly presentation. For its balance of half the book as photos, by George Gmelch and Pat Langan, and the other half as efficient text by Sharon (with a thorough--for that time--bibliography), this handsome work, despite a cover and typeface that panders to \\"tinker\\" stereotypes, captures the transitional period between the past and present Ireland in which the travellers play symbolic, practical, and complex roles.	2005-05-06

Books	3	2	2	N	N	For better & worse, the only book on US Traveller clans	I wish that there was a well-crafted, even-handed investigation of the U.S. traveller families of Irish and Scottish descent who comprise the bulk of the material in this 400-plus page book. Cultural mores and anthropological insights are scattered about especially in the Murphys Village (Augusta, Georgia park noted as a center for clans) and the marriage chapters. But Wright's intent, weakened if more widely marketed for the non-scholarly reader by the ill-chosen, sensationalist blurbs that cheapen his book on the inside and back covers, is to expose what has been a long-established and little understood part of largely rural Americana to a larger public. To correct an earlier Amazon review or two, the Romani (Gypsies) are not kin to the traveller clans; this is a misnomer. Wright does show how the Roma differ from the travellers and that there is actually little crossover in the Irish and Scottish travellers he follows. This book is not ideal, but until others tidy up what Wright's rummaged, it is by default the place to start reading. (By the way, in 1997 an indie B-movie with Bill Pullman, Mark Wahlberg, and Julianne Margulies was made, Traveller; NBC Dateline around the same year profiled the Disney scam that begins Wright's book. Later, as other Amazon reviewers relate, the Toogood child abuse video incident sparked another brief span of less than approving attention by the media about US \\"Irish\\" travellers.)<br /><br />In the meantime, Wright's take, that took 16 years and that he admits he left unfinished until the early 90s Disney World scam and the closure to the saga of Jimmy Burke (his primary informant) finds sensationalist focal points for what the author admits is a repetitive account of the scams perpetrated by the Northern and Southern Irish travellers upon bargain hunting trailer buyers, by pigeon drops involving the elderly, those wanting suspiciously cheap bargains for roofing and driveway sealing, and, as the author accurately points out, those \\"refs\\" or \\"country people\\" wanting something for next to nothing. Without those \\"refs\\" also willing to deal outside of the proper paperwork and business protections, an observer can agree that the travellers are only taking advantage of people who themselves participate in scams in which the \\"refs\\" are also eager to bypass the law in favor of a quick buck saved or stolen.<br /><br />Wright was a correspondent for Trailer Life Magazine, so the bulk of the unfortunately if appropriately named Scam deals with the minutiae of trailer sale cons perpetrated with names, facts, and dates. He does protect his sources, and passes on only general details to others. A few hundred pages of the scams, expanded from his 1980s articles in that magazine, does provide I suppose helpful evidence for those needing to learn about how to avoid being ripped off, but the data grows tedious as it's endlessly repeated as the crimes keep on keeping on. He does claim to have documented here with all names and dates what became his obsession as he determined to delve into the traveller subcultures and find out from the victimizers and the victims both sides of the situation.<br /><br />As a descendant of non-US, native Irish, travellers, I found Wright's book dispiriting in its rambling and uneven pace, which ironically befits a description of a group living always on the road and one step ahead of the authorities. Still, I must admit that I believe Wright's sincerity in exposing the frauds that do occur, and that he is not acting out of any prejudice against this American sub-culture in particular. He tells on pg. 8 at the start that he had been invited by the travellers themselves to be a witness to their set-ups, and then goes on to say that travellers claim that only a few bad apples spoil their otherwise honest activities.

Bellow's later work, of which this might be the first harbinger, tends to muse rather than move given the lack of energetic plot. After the first hundred pages, setting up the major and minor characters and promising a half-satirical, half-serious look at intellectuals in 1970 NYC--sort of an updated Glass family from Salinger's oeuvre--MSP's pace settles into a rut until it wears out 150 pp. later. Yet, the last paragraph is beautiful!<br /><br />Parts of this novel do shine. Especially at the start, the bruised condition of Sammler invites pity more than put-downs, and the criticisms he makes of his urban jungle have only become more prescient, sadly, with 35 years to erode further the Gotham infrastructure. I found much less ranting than obituaries of the late Bellow had set me up to expect here. Stanley Crouch's introduction helps place the context of the novel within black-Jewish relations at the end of the 60s and the slide into the catastrophic 70s decade and \\"drop dead, New York.\\" Crouch understandably given his interests promotes the black pickpocket figure that motivates the first section of the book, but this character largely drops out until the rather forced, awkwardly staged, and overly symbolic climactic scene very late in the story. Still, I wish the introduction in the 2004 Penguin paperback was inserted at the end of the novel, as Crouch does include story spoilers.<br /><br />Equally crucial are the Dr Lal's and the setting's lunar subtexts, the aftermath of a napalm attack by the Israelis in the Six Day War (the best scene in the book, and I wish there was more of the Jesuit photojournalist Fr Newell), the Holocaust and the return from the grave and the murder of a German soldier, the post-60s collapse of a livable city, liberal cant, Wellesian asides, and failed Olaf Stapleton Cosmopolis world scheme--Crouch correctly draws your attention to these as key elements that carom off Sammler's own musings and longings, as with many of his later novels from this point on, especially on Judaism and the (non?)existence of the soul after death in the minds of aging protagonists. The use of \\"we\\" by the omniscient narrator a couple of times only unsettles more the reader.<br /><br />But Shula, Eisen, Fetter, Wallace, and Lim all disappoint as the supporting cast after initially promising entrances, the subplot of Wallace and Fetter's plane never engages, and that of Lim makes the middle of the book (as Crouch notes) sag for at least fifty pages as the Indian prof and Sammler chat in a conversation that probably only Goethe could have pulled off, not two speakers in English as a second (or fifth) language after a weary day in a sultry city, no matter how learned they both were.<br /><br />This is Bellow's flaw: much of his high-flown thoughts here could've been placed better in essays rather than as fiction. Far too much of this content drifts and loses dynamism, and I do not believe this is intentional for the character of Sammler, for it characterizes Bellow's figureheads that from this novel on began to take over his novels. They're fascinating in small doses, but fail to leap off the page into convincing figures you could imagine meeting given your own presumed lack of erudition and creature comfort that his metropolitan bon vivants possess.as key elements that carom off Sammler's own musings and longings, as with many of his later novels from this point on, especially on Judaism and the (non?)existence of the soul after death in the minds of aging protagonists.

He was lucky to be able to record their last days on the road, as since the 1970s-mid 90s here documented, many travellers have settled into more permanent dwellings. These photos show many careworn faces, women at early ages looking much older under the burden of many children, men equally weary of a hard existence in the often unforgiving Irish climate, and children gazing at the lens with mingled suspicion and interest.<br /><br />In his sensitive introduction, that could and should have been far more in-depth, given what Oppersdorff's capable of telling us, the photographer indicates how wary his subjects were of his presence. I believe this would've merited much more detail, and the sparse presentation of this book--63 plates and maybe 3000 words of text at best, only begins to whet one's curiousity.	2005-04-29

After Bellow's death, I was curious about his last novel and its ruminations about death. Many reflections on Judaism, the barbarity of the 20c, Platonic love, the longing to believe that our individual demise will not mean that \\"the pictures come to a stop\\" inside our mind. Ravelstein isn't as uproariously Falstaffian as the jacket blurb seems to hint, and his sybaritic and rarified lifestyle places him at an even higher remove from the daily humdrum than other Bellovian protagonists. Still, parrots, Michael Jackson, a Mircea Eliadeian nemesis, and the switch in an aging panjandrum from Athens to Jerusalem as a source of wisdom comes across affectingly at the best moments here.<br /><br />Less engrossing was the level of creature comforts indulged in by Ravelstein and his Johnsonian (Boswellian?) erstwhile biographer Chick, who move about in realms that seem so distant from daily tsurris that the novel's theme of reinventing one's self--to the extreme in Dayton, Ohio's native son remade and remodelled into a Francophilic pundit admired by the rich and famous in corridors of power appears more unreal than a depiction of what any student at a large research university may recognize as a portrait of a star professor and his coterie.<br /><br />This may be Bellow's perhaps accidental point, although the latter part of the book, which details the sickness of Chick and some notably dull dreams he has while medicated, sags after Ravelstein's death. More vivid, besides, than his current trophy wife is his depiction of his former Slavic spouse, the venal Vela. Nikki and Rosamund suffer by comparison as the two male characters' current partners, and I wondered why Bellow didn't allow a shift in his structure of the story here to make Vela more present than past tense, as this dissipates much of the power inherent in her and Grialescu's menacing presences.<br /><br />All in all, a good example of Bellow's gift for the snap of a vigorous prose style, intelligent and thoughtful, but rather distant and self-involved in its concentration on characters that those of us outside the tenured and the cosseted ranks may not perceive as humans as fallible and menaced as those at the top. We all meet our mortality, nonetheless: the inescapable ending that Ravenstein faces with Chick not far behind, or ahead./> <br />All in all, a good example of Bellow's gift for the snap of a vigorous prose style, intelligent and thoughtful, but rather distant and self-involved in its concentration on characters that those of us outside the tenured and the cosseted ranks may not perceive as humans as fallible and menaced as those at the top.

Perhaps his wish is to focus on only his own career, but this reticence does not seem to be matched in the rest of his account, as his dealings as the editor of the magazine Irish Writing brought him into close working and often personal relationships with the best authors that Ireland produced in the middle of the 20th century, a position matched by his own tenure at Dev's paper The Irish Press, where Marcus served as literary editor and continued to publish quality efforts.<br /><br />He also has penned his own novels about Cork Jewish life, and must be one of the few writers capable of translating not only Hebrew but Irish fluently! While this autobiography, by its title, slides a bit away from giving a full picture of Marcus, it's worthwhile for insights into mid-century Irish literati, and gives a fitting counterpart to the tales of bohemian Dublin in the post-war period from John Ryan (Remembering How We Stood) and Anthony Cronin (Dead as Doornails). Less drinking in Marcus' version, however!	2005-04-22

The strengths of the study lie in the formation of the Waffen-SS and why it--unlike the Wehrmacht--recruited foreigners, gradually loosening the \\"aryan\\" requirements as the war advanced and the prospects declined for the Nazis. Weale, with a military background, gives intriguing information about how pressure was brought down on susceptible POWs to often mislead them into signing up for anti-Bolshevik, pro-German (although this latter motive could be obscured) activity. The author tells the story of the British Free Corps, and this part takes up largely the latter half of the book. Earlier sections recapitulate stories of traitors such as John Amery, William Joyce, and the pre-war British Fascists and how idealists, con artists, counterspies, and those soldiers simply double-crossed or blackmailed by their German guards turned to the other side, for a variety of reasons, not all of them as clear as would be supposed.<br /><br />Compared to Sean Murphy (no relation to me) in his similar 2003 \\"Letting the Side Down: British Traitors of the Second World War,\\" (for which Weale wrote the preface), Weale lacks some of Murphy's verve and irony. Especially in the pre-BFC sections, the pace bogs down in terminology, ranks, and background details that befit military history but do slow the narrative. On the other hand, Murphy and Weale--whose studies often overlap and compliment each other, as they work from the same archives--rely more on these primary sources which were opened to historians in the later 1990s. Weale's first-hand knowledge of how military intelligence operates makes for informative and instructive reading.<br /><br />Few noble actions emerge in these pages, and one of the quirks of this tale is that the worst traitor in number of lives he betrayed, Harold Cole, also saved many British soldiers during the earlier, post-Dunkirk period, before regressing back to his wonted criminality. Weale finds little nobility in much of his study's participants, but he examines their deeds fairly, soberly, and with an eye for the rather futile cause for which a few British soldiers risked so much, daring to place fighting the Soviets, making some money, avoiding jail, or simply acting out of fear while trying to align their loyalty to Britain with their assistance to the Reich.o his wonted criminality.

I put down this book the night before the papal election, exactly at the point where Morris discusses how Ratzinger actually put the rein on some of John Paul II's more forceful moves towards declaring statements blocking women's ordination as infallible; carefully nuanced exegesis by Morris reveals very subtle but nonetheless wiggle room for future movement away from some of the last pope's more dogmatic pronouncements. He fits this into a battle between cardinals and the episcopate promoting a collegial right to establish doctrine based on their accumulated experience as part of the Church's magisterium against the centralisation of papal power. This data which may indicate the new pope's ability to create flexibility despite what on surface may appear to the casual observer only more rigidity, buried inside a footnote on pg. 349, is typical of the wealth of detail--you must read the extensive endnotes as well as the text proper to appreciate how thorough has been the author's research--found in this popular yet scholarly treatment of the Church from about the mid-19 c to the late 1990s.<br /><br />In retrospect, some of the concerns Morris finds diminishing in his 1997 study have only increased, such as the pedophilia (or more often adolescent boys rather than pre-teens with priests, Morris and many critics parse) scandals that grew more prominent rather than less so in the beginning of the current decade. Vocations appear to keep tumbling at least in the West; non-compliance with Catholic teaching by the rank-and-file grows in the American segment due to democratic tendencies constantly eroding the earlier, pre-assimilationist culture that codified American Catholicism mid-20 c. These tendencies, as Morris shows, created tension from the later 19 c onward, and the battles with Rome by the U.S. bishops are far from new. Also, the role of the Hispanic church seems, despite many references, to be diminished (perhaps reflecting an East Coast orientation naturally taken for the majority of the narrative). As a related correction, St Thomas the Apostle parish in L.A. is not on its Eastside--typical of Morris's scholarship, this was a rare mistake in an admirably solid resource that taught me an enormous amount about everything from John Stuart Mill's liberalism to moral theology to John Ireland's far-reaching impact upon the course of the national Church. However, I was disappointed to find that two sources that would've aided Morris' often moving depiction of life in the triumphal, dogmatic, and secure mid-20c decades were absent from his notes: Garry Wills' \\"Bare Ruined Choirs,\\" and Jubilee Magazine, a forerunner of the liturgical and cultural renaissance that the post-Vatican II era either expanded or truncated.<br /><br />When describing how Fulton Sheen lectured, how the old Mass flowed, or how theologians battle it out over birth control, Morris never loses sight of the telling quote to illuminate larger issues. His discussion of subsidiarity and how polarised opposites Dorothy Day and Fr Coughlin could argue from this same basis of natural law and social justice doctrine fascinated me! From the Irish famine to Americanist vs. separatist controversies, through the dispersal of urban ethnics into suburbia, the connection between sex and rural ethos in traditional Catholicism, to current dichotomies in various dioceses in a time of fewer priests and more lay people running parishes, Morris is excellent. He's fair to all sides, although he shows a bit of bias against the hardest right-wing and left-wing factions both. His model is one of adaptation without dilution, certainly a challenge for such a vast institution on the one hand suffering losses to not only non-practicing millions but evangelical sects, on the other struggling to avoid the fate of mainstream Protestantism, which has, according to Morris, seemingly lost its moral and cultural clout in today's nation. Although on the Americanist controversy and the labor movement in the mid 20c, he bogs down in too much detail, at other moments, as in his travels in late-20c American parishes, his mastery of minutiae to explain big issues winningly works well.<br /><br />As he warns, the tug of secularism--whatever one's view on the current state of Catholicism--presents a warning to those who want the Church to adjust totally to its surroundings. He takes heed of the fate of Episcopalians--fewer in all of America than Catholics in Los Angeles: \\"Once a religion assimilates to the culture, it almost invariably diminishes into a social center or a low-cost therapy program.\\" (411)20c, he bogs down in too much detail, at other moments, as in his travels in late-20c American parishes, his mastery of minutiae to explain big issues winningly works well.

I first heard about this case when reading James Joyce's essay \\"Ireland at the Bar,\\" and was intrigued by the clash of British \\"justice\\" (sic) and the native, Irish-speaking Connachtmen, who were set-up by a system conducted in a tongue through which they could not converse, and by judicial rituals nearly incomprehensible to a group of peasants brought to a show trial by a government--for neither the first nor last time--eager to frame innocent Irish in the name of meting out punishment by the British establishment.<br /><br />A notable feature of this book is its delving not only into the court transcripts but the context within which the interrogations occurred, and the wider social and political impact. I'm reminded of another study about a case almost exactly a century later, that of the \\"Kerry babies,\\" that has received a more theoretical but similarly thorough treatment by sociologist Tom Inglis, \\"Truth, Power, and Lies.\\" (Dublin: UCD Press, 2003) Fr Waldron, like Prof Inglis, uses one case study to understand power struggles within the greater Irish society undergoing change, pressures from abroad, and that serves as a symbol of deeper forces and tensions that attracted so much attention to a rural murder.

US	53087372	RBKL7EY0MX39D	0750929367	997132066	Letting the Side Down	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Introduces Axis WWII collaborators & sympathisers	Sean Murphy (no relation that I know of!) gives an accessible, cogent, and brisk overview of a complicated topic, that only recently--with the partial opening of access to archives--has begun to be shared: how British civilians, soldiers, and diplomats shared secrets with the Nazis (and the Japanese, in one chapter) before and during WWII. He writes clearly about an impressively varied cast of dozens of scoundrels, opportunists, deluded idealists, and just plain spies. Most seem to have taken the chance for excitement or escape from a POW camp, a chance to revenge themselves for imagined or real grievances against the British in some personal or ideological manner, or for the cash--which rarely amounted to much. Some were half-German having been raised in England; some fell in love with a German and wished to become reunited with a paramour through espionage on the Continent; some--like PG Wodehouse or Susan Hilton--found themselves trapped as the Nazis gained control of France or were shipwrecked and landed in German custody or were interned as foreign nationals. Many were lonely or misfits, and easily induced by their new captors into some level of cooperation, although this process, as Murphy carefully shows, was not always clear at the outset to the British subjects under Nazi pressure.<br /><br />With characters such as Paul Nash, Norman Baillie-Stewart, Thomas Baty (an elderly Englishman working for the Japanese who dressed in geisha gear), the Mitford sisters, and the best known, Lord Haw-Haw/William Joyce and John Amery, the narrative takes you quickly but with sufficient attention to detail, often drawn from recently available National Archive primary sources, through the actions and the reasons why a few British, along with assorted Irish, Scots, and Channel Islanders, chose to--often rationalising that they were defending true British ideals--side with the German forces, often in the early days of the war before Dunkirk and the Blitz revealed the true nature of Nazi plans for Britain.<br /><br />Having a special interest in William Joyce, I was impressed by Murphy's attention to primary sources here. Although Mary Kenny's biography, \\"Germany Calling,\\" had not appeared when this book was published, Murphy relies not on JA Cole's superb earlier biography or Selwyn's briefer work on Joyce so much as archival evidence. This concentration on first-hand detail, whenever possible, rather than secondary sources keeps the pace fresh and the scholarship current. Even with a rather familiar subject such as Joyce, Murphy comes up with cogent insights. About Joyce's claim that he was a British citizen rather than American-born, Murphy suggests that this knowledge may have not been known to Joyce earlier in his life, due to his father's secrecy, so \\"perhaps Joyce actually believed he was British.\\" (104) Additionally, in an account of his trial, Murphy contrasts the fate of Joyce and Amery with lower-profile collaborators, all of whom had done far more damage to the Crown materially or in cost of lives, who met often much less fatal fates.<br /><br />This scope, therefore, opens up what earlier, more microcosmic studies (see Adrian Weale--who provides here a brief preface) of individuals or groups such as the British Free Corps or pre-war British Fascists have not been able to: a panoramic view of how all of these perhaps rather disparate elements fit together prior to and during WWII to represent the often hapless, occasionally cunning lot of those determined or deluded to undermine the British struggle against the Axis powers.<br /><br />It surprises me that the Italians received little direct assistance in comparison to the Germans, at least from the evidence Murphy assembles. While pre-war connections existed between Mosley, the BUF, and various individuals prior to the war, I wondered about the wartime ties I'd presume must have existed between a few Italians in Britain and Mussolini's intelligence network. By comparison withthe Nazis, few spies emerge, at least in these pages, with any strong Italian-British connections. Also, the predicament of Sark and its doyenne as one of the Channel Islands under the Nazi occupation goes unmentioned. Outside of a couple of mixed metaphors, I found Murphy's study free of stylistic infelicities, and it was a pleasure to read his carefully documented, thoughtfully presented, and often exciting (with a wry touch of humour or irony when required) account.ison with the Nazis, few spies emerge, at least in these pages, with any strong Italian-British connections.

Not to say it's an easy read. Bits of the Irish language, proverbs, Celtic legend, Japanese and native American lore, Hiberno-English, allusions and elisions packed with every poem, this collection does echo, as the publisher's blurb suggests, a bit of Muldoon's adapted state of New Jersey's forebear William Carlos Williams at times. His translations of the old Irish verse Pangur Ban and two Rilke poems show that he's skilled at rendering into solidity other voices besides the many within his own imagination tumbling forth here in typically erudite and rather daunting fashion.<br /><br />Sleeve notes--inspired by on various rock albums anticipates Nick Hornby's essays on rock songs by a few years, and Muldoon's growing immersion in his American surroundings and family life makes for entertaining, if again often puzzling, explorations. This book's best read following Madoc and The Annals of Chile, for it builds upon relationships established in these previous collections, which are even more challenging than the usually briefer forays into the metaphorical and metaphysical here, one of the best of which begins the book.<br /><br />\\"The Mudroom\\" casts about a heap of junk and treasure to uncover ancient Judaic archetypes within a country shed--just one example of the juxtapositions Muldoon's mind works within to create disturbing as well as enlightening scenarios that linger and jumble in the mind after you close these dense if terse pages.	2005-04-11

It's actually a better place to start reading the \\"later\\" Muldoon, in fact. Domesticity has tamed a bit of the bravura evident in the arcane lore dazzling the other collections perhaps too much. Poems here like \\"Unapproved Road,\\" mixing Taureg with IRA in its 1950s failed \\"border campaign,\\" wittily contrast in a way that Muldoon warms to more and more as his work confronts his own hyphenating midlife identity into an American as much as an Irish poet. \\"Guns & Butter,\\" \\"Whitethorns,\\" \\"A Brief Course on Decommissioning\\" address the post-1998 events in the North of Ireland intelligently and without pandering. His children and wife now enter his work to round it out more vividly, and at least some of the shorter poems here continue the clarity sought in \\"Hay\\"'s briefer verses.<br /><br />The reason this collection loses a star is the last poem, as usual in his work a longer one: \\"At the Sign of the Black Horse.\\" The Irish navvy-Jewish mogul undercurrent never convinces, but seems layered over the parental concerns. Where Muldoon often swerves to avoid obstacles, here he seems to plow ahead, but ends up floundering a bit when taking more time to expand and concentrate his direction would've made for a better poetic quest into a very deserving subject of culture clash.	2005-04-11

Muldoon here follows his overwhelmingly learned Madoc with another circumnavigation of all his forbiddingly clever and sometimes satisfying contours of his (not our) known world. Part one, as with the previous volume, takes in bits of this realm and, oin Brazil, confounds me even as in the tender and lacerating Incantata, moves me with its honesty at a past amour. The Sonogram and Footling and The Birth track his daughter's arrival, while the long poem that comprises most of this volume, Yarrow, takes on the 60s, colonialism, a sheltered Irish childhood, Arthurian figures, drug culture, Romans, the Wild West, and \\"the loathsome Mike Oldfield\\" to name a few topics.<br /><br />Not for the fainthearted, but rewarding in fits and starts and never less than ambitious, although with no annotations or guidance, each reader will never get out of it a fraction of the learning Muldoon's put into it. This criticism, as Incantata avers, is not unknown to the poet, but it does discourage all but the boldest who journey into a phantasmagorical and ever-changing depiction of intelligence at its craftiest and most conniving.

Muldoon's progressed into ever more difficult territory in his collections, and for a poet still relatively young (just over 50), he reminds me of a musical prodigy (first volume at 23) who's not fallen victim to trends, nostalgia, or predictability. I tackled these 250 poems ready for a challenge, and received one. The headings with a major Western thinker helped me in the way that Joyce's scheme aided readers of Ulysses: the titles are detached from the work--in brackets--yet need to be integrated into the poetic sequences.<br /><br />Like Joyce's Homeric template, how each thinker fits into the poem below remains rather obscure to those of us lacking a knowledge of 250 big names in Western thought. Puns, wordplay, imagery, and content sometimes surfaced recognisably, but many of the names were only vaguely recalled by me or not at all. Surely a thesis awaits on their correspondences. Meanwhile, the narrative itself remains clever throughout. Its fragmentation depicts well the colonial utopian dream being shattered by Native and post-colonial realities, although I was disappointed that the whole Madoc-Mandan-\\"Welsh Indian\\" topic remained, as the subtitle perhaps indicates, a \\"mystery\\" barely acknowledged.<br /><br />Muldoon's more engaging, IMHO, than his near-counterpart in age and origin Seamus Heaney, for PM possesses less of a gravitas and more intellectual playfulness in his concentration of an almost cinematic, and non-agrarian, employment of myth, action, and reaction within the mind of his characters. He's set himself a grand canvas upon which to paint his masterpiece here, and he's not so transparent that he easily exhausts close readings. Like musicians in it for the long haul, he's still improving after decades of honing his craft, and this work, while surely for a rather recondite reader, rewards and entices in its flirtatious teasing of what we can know and what remains enigmatic, a mystery despite manifest destiny and all the philosophies we can accumulate, in books or in life's own battle.st destiny and all the philosophies we can accumulate, in books or in life's own battle.	2005-04-10

They evoke not only Kafka but Joyce in his Ithaca chapter of Ulysses; the omniscient and patiently probing inquisitor, here, finally gets \\"ES\\" to admit his weariness, but the rare entry of the interrogated into the set-up only enhances its blended horror and suspense.<br /><br />This ambitious novel, in its other modes of transmission, \\"Diary of a Madman,\\" and Travel Scenes, intersperse with the Criminal Investigation sections. These, to me, recall many other Central European fictional post-war attempts to plumb the heart of mid-20c darkness. It is not to fault Kis for doing well what he does here, but these portions lack the excitement of the interrogative modes, and by comparison languish on the page in their comparative introspection and wandering reveries.<br /><br />As a whole, the novel works best in Bloomsian asides, such as ES thinking about how to see the world through glasses that imitate the curvature of a dog's eyes, the weariness of fecundity, or the closing pages in which the Garden of Eden, the stages of man's life, the battle against nothingness so characteristic of Jewish secularised mentality, and the link to Kis' own forebears becomes clearly visible behind the novelistic scaffolding of the previous 250 pages, which read quickly for a subject so dense.	2005-04-10

Peadar O'Dowd has produced collections of Galway via the camera before; this one gains wider distribution, is attractive, and focuses most on the 1940s-to 1979, ending with the late pope's visit to Ballybrit. Any visitor to today's Galway can only marvel at the dereliction in the streets and buildings as late as the 1970s, and despite the unease by many at the touristy, gentrified, suburbanising, and increasingly exorbitant nature of the present city, no one can be that nostalgic for some of the destitution that no manner of nostalgia can cleanse from the photos seen here.<br /><br />Not all are grim, of course. Workers, clergy, sportsmen, students, dancers, shawled women, camogie teams, shepherds, and peddlers crowd these pages with faces often a bit reserved and shy, expressing a diffidence that characterises many in the past generations in their public expressions. Galway's own beauty may not leap out of the black & white photos, but giving the city a non-postcard tint only highlights the handsomeness as well as the dramatic rich-poor contrasts that even today mark the place.<br /><br />Careful annotations show readers details that casual observers would miss, and O'Dowd's knowledge of the scenes now vanished or altered makes for a book that's instructive, accessible, and attractively presented. I only wish more volumes could be assembled, so I could find the still elusive photos I hoped for!	2005-04-08

It depicts an episode of a robbery and its prequel and sequel from  a triple perspective, and intersperses poetic description, slangy argot, and the contrast between small-town and Dublin Irish effectively. The potentially maudlin or hackneyed theme of sexual abuse motivates key actions here, and the imagery, to the author's credit, controls this unstable element effectively.<br /><br />The other play, \\"Blue,\\" may be slower and more meditative, with a sprawling plot that takes in growing up among a trio in a village in the West, and in print, seemed to often downshift from the dynamism of its predecessor, preferring a leisurely exploration of maturity, again with a background of drugs and violence lurking and coming, in both efforts, out of the blue.<br /><br />I predict Ms Sarma will go on to expand upon the potential she's shown here, and I certainly would be open to adjusting my rating if I had the chance to see her plays on stage.	2005-04-02

It's a tragicomic narrative, wittily told with the right amount of self-deprecation as well as begrudgery, comeuppance (the scene at Clonmacnoise especially grand), and bracing realism.<br /><br />In an account that dismisses romanticization of Eire even as it laments the passing of traditional caretakers of its heritage (the churches, the antiquarians, the gaeilgoiri), Roy balances his own regrets for the loss of the past with a realisation that such a flight away from historical and cultural foundations may be exactly what today's Irish men and women desire for themselves.	2005-03-24

This collection works better in its brevity than \\"Cries of an Irish Caveman\\" and its focus upon aging, continuing that previous work's title poem, narrows the thrust of this new collection to decent effect. Decent, because there's not much to draw you in to Durcan's appeal if you have not earlier been convinced of it. Despite the Vermeer cover painting and the title, no poems about paintings this time round. Wrapped in a paper ribbon with a blurb from \\"The Lovely Bones\\" author Alice Sebold, its presentation seems designed to heighten the author's profile with an endorsment by a currently middlebrow popular novelist, but I don't think Durcan needs such help. Although he deserves attention, which does not seem to come his way in terms of his recent work as much as before. I would recommend this as acceptable fresh material to those familiar with the poet, but newcomers should start with the anthology \\"A Snail in his Prime.\\"<br /><br />I fear that Durcan has not found much to replace his earlier diatribes against Catholic, provincial, and busybody Ireland of earlier decades. As his society suburbanises, there's less room for sharp imagery, parody, singsong, or sheer joy, it appears from these pages. Foreign trips again provide some counterpart, but the Irish native peoplescape seems less fascinating for the poet's eye, ear, and pen than in his 1970/80s versifiying heyday.	2005-03-24

What will be most challenging to any reader unaccustomed to the editorial omniscience in Victorian triple-decker novels such as those of Dickens, Thackeray, or Eliot will be Gordon's use of a garrulous and always intrusive narrator who goads us along and guides the story in and out of the predicaments and pensiveness of Pearl, Maria, and Joseph. I let this voice wash over me for dozens of pages at a time, resisting and then surrendering and then being annoyed anew.<br /><br />Maria resents Pearl's boyfriend Finbar (note previously an error on pg. 271: \\"The Gardai\\" recalled by a native from the north of Ireland as invading homes in Belfast. As the gardai are the state police south of the border, this is at present improbable to impossible!): `She almost says, You are simply going to have to stop condescending to me. But she needs to keep his favor. She still hasn't heard Stevie's story, which seems to be connected, somehow, to Pearl's. Without this information, she's paralyzed.' (280). I felt the same way about what I call this `recording angel' that never seemed to let the story take its own course, who constantly, like Jiminy Cricket or perhaps a voice of reason, kept up a running commentary like a `color man' chattering while the sports game carries you on with its own energy, no need for added banter. Still, this irritating if sometimes endearing feature of narrative is rarely used at length in popular contemporary fiction, and Gordon's to be admired if also resented for daring such an insistently patronising mode of conveying the details of her long and serious novel.<br /><br />It could have benefited from some of the gallows humour beloved by the Irish, New York and Dubliner alike. Gordon's tackling generational changes, maternal love, and the end of idealism, so perhaps, like Maria and Joseph, 60s earnestness trumps the `whatever' generation the hippies spawned. The voice may be that of, as it tells us, a sort of pre-Marlon Brando godfather to Pearl; I preferred thinking of it as a female angel, myself.<br /><br />Allusions to biblical events and figures grow as the novel progresses for some satisfying typological comparisons between Judas, Mary Magdalene, the Resurrection, and classical figures like the aforementioned Antigone. Dr Morrisey poses as a great foil to the no-nonsense Maria, and their showdowns wittily play off New York and Irish characterisations. Pearl's father, in case you're wondering, is a briefly present Cambodian doctor.  This makes the hunger striker, as her father conceives of to her mother: `If we should have a child it would be very impure: Jewish, Russian, Cambodian, Catholic, Buddhist. A real mess. I am in love with the idea of mess. The mess is our only hope against the tyranny of the pure.' (95)<br /><br />The RIRA and hard-line militants represents the pure; Pearl counters with her own assertion of a trans-national identity. She becomes an emblem of the object at one with the color. This, in an early aside, matches what the narrator notes about Irish, in its equivalence of white, grey, and yellow with the meanings of brightness/wisdom, stone, and noble. Pearl sees, in her delirium, detached faces as if cut-outs from her past, of Stevie and others she has loved and known. This scene reminded me of French Symbolist art of a century ago: faces like petals, falling from a branch upon a blank and therefore pure background. In Pearl's quest for equivalence, the deed of starvation blurs into suicide so that martyrdom and witnessing cannot be disentangled. Her embodiment is her chosen path to enlightenment. What Maria, the doctor, and Joseph come to represent in their intervention you can discover for yourself.ver for yourself.	2005-03-16

Haven't heard as much about him since his initial burst upon the scene, and this novel--one of a projected trilogy of a Fianna Fail politician and his family--shows both his ability to intelligently parse the emotions and to hit a bit of a block when it comes to making fiction rather than verse to express such emotion.<br /><br />The story's old-fashioned. At one point, a character picks up a light novel to fall asleep to. Having done the same with this over the past few nights, meaning no disrespect, but I wondered--this book with its pretty watercolor cover, embossed purplish title, and Poolbeg (sort of a middlebrow first-printing publisher for Irish fiction) imprint, I wondered if what I held also fit the bill for my nocturnal entertainment. But McCarthy does take on, thankfully, serious issues beyond the rather conventional romance that brings in the younger folks in the plot. The politician, a veteran of the \\"old\\" IRA, now is a member of the Dail (Irish parliamental house of representatives) in the midst of the \\"Emergency\\" (that is, WW2). His constituency is after him for all sorts of trivia among the hardships the Irish endured--although they pale next to what the rest of Europe's facing.<br /><br />Such contrasts, expressed in the titular contrast between daughter Christine's romance with an officer serving among the British and their ward Asya/Alice's half-Jewish heritage and the threat she feels if Hitler invades Ireland (a real, if rather peripheral, supposition if Britain had capitulated to the Nazis) highlight the Irish vs. Continental mindsets, if a bit too neatly and inertly given the unexciting plot.<br /><br />Three stars, then. More credit for the ideas than their realisation upon the page. McCarthy writes well enough, and I would seek out the other volume of his trilogy (the third installment to my knowledge not published), Without Power, that looks at 1973 and the Fianna Fail's fate then in the Cork/Waterford area during another election.<br /><br />But the lack of evident excitement makes for a more realistic, if less involving, novel looking at the pressures upon a politician. A local IRA youth has killed a detective, and the tension over whether a hangman will be imported (from England, as really happened at the time) for his execution drives the FF pol all the way to see DeValera and plead (with the old IRA's chief) for clemency. The comparison of legitimate violence in the war for Irish independence vs. the crackdown by Dev on the later guerrila campaign against those perceived to have sold out for collaboration with the Crown, the role of WW2 neutrality, anti-semitism, and the actual precarious state in which the Irish Free State existed until the war turned the tide beginning in the summer of 1942 all make for a valuable insight into the Irish mind at the time.my knowledge not published), Without Power, that looks at 1973 and the Fianna Fail's fate then in the Cork/Waterford area during another election.<br /><br />But the lack of evident excitement makes for a more realistic, if less involving, novel looking at the pressures upon a politician.

But close enough to take us inside the passionate debates that have raged since around WW1, hard to believe, about the state of what we see packaged as the text of Ulysses. [Out of the whole volume, I only found one typo and one persistent misspelling: The Irish Literary Supplement's editor being not Robert Lowerey but Lowery.] Scandal is lively, intelligent, and rewarding in its evocation of the complicated birth, growth, and now perhaps immortal lifespan over the past eighty-odd years. With a parlous history of a manuscript that from the start emerged in multiple copies, the problem of a proof or a copy-text that later readers could assume was that intended by Joyce became more and more difficult to solve.<br /><br />Arnold's clarity, sly wit, and fair-minded treatment of those literary detectives who sought to reconstruct what Joyce had never left behind--one reliable manuscript of the massive novel--makes for a fascinatingly told and challenging puzzle. Arnold guides you through an immense amount of learned material in an impressively clear and coherent command of the details. He stays outside any partisan cheerleading, and takes pains to reveal his opinions while keeping them apart from the facts arranged by the many participants who have labored to patch what Joyce did not.<br /><br />You learn about obscenity and its effect on the clandestine and widely scattered serialisation of the nascent novel and why it never was actually delivered as one complete draft; Anglo-American vs. German editing theory; the aging Richard Ellman's inability to think straight about Gabler's strategems; copyright laws or their lack when it comes to the U.S. and Ulysses; how cowed those entrusted with overseeing the Gabler project gave in to what Arnold shows is a gallant but flawed campaign to create a \\"continuous manuscript text\\" out of nothing but the editor's determination to drink from a mirage; the hostility of most entrenched scholars to any upstart daring to take on the Joyce establishment, tenured, moneyed, and often arrogant; the machinations of the Joyce estate to protect their income generator from chugging into the public domain and staying there; the John Kidd vs. Hans Gabler battles recalling David vs. Goliath after the \\"corrected\\" {from what, exactly, in the first place?) text is published 1984-6; and, in this updated printing of Arnold's 1992 study, the aftermath of \\"the Joyce Wars,\\" the return to power of the Joyce Estate, the failed assault by Danis Rose, and the current stalemate, given that few in the world among the 400 \\"Joyceans\\" have the knowledge, the stamina, or the finances to improve the faults that Gabler perpetuated (his edition turning eponymous rather than \\"corrected\\" in later printings) as he sought to eliminate the 5000 supposed errors in the 1922 text.<br /><br />Again, this all makes for an engrossing read if you like Joyce and/or literary detective work. It reminds me of Richard Altick's books on earlier case studies by editors long before the computer age. Now, editors like Gabler use the machine, but how can artificial intelligence catch what humans do not proofread first? And, when it comes to Joyce sans pariel, how do we know what that clever Dubliner meant anyway? Such questions, as JJ predicted, still keep the professors busy, animated, and stimulated. You'll be too, after reading this. And, as Arnold concludes, read the original text, in whatever edition, most of all, for its endless languours, frustrations, and delights.o create a \\"continuous manuscript text\\" out of nothing but the editor's determination to drink from a mirage; the hostility of most entrenched scholars to any upstart daring to take on the Joyce establishment, tenured, moneyed, and often arrogant; the machinations of the Joyce estate to protect their income generator from chugging into the public domain and staying there; the John Kidd vs. Hans Gabler battles recalling David vs. Goliath after the \\"corrected\\" {from what, exactly, in the first place?) text is published 1984-6; and, in this updated printing of Arnold's 1992 study, the aftermath of \\"the Joyce Wars,\\" the return to power of the Joyce Estate, the failed assault by Danis Rose, and the current stalemate, given that few in the world among the 400 \\"Joyceans\\" have the knowledge, the stamina, or the finances to improve the faults that Gabler perpetuated (his edition turning eponymous rather than \\"corrected\\" in later printings) as he sought to eliminate the 5000 supposed errors in the 1922 text. <br /> <br />Again, this all makes for an engrossing read if you like Joyce and/or literary detective work.

The first section, on his (supposed?) near-drowning off Australia's Bondi Beach, does have its inspired lyricism as it meditatively sputters about for awhile, into a consideration of impending doom at the edge of civilisation. The next part, an assortment of briefer poems in his accustomed style, shows off its best moments in some efforts as short as two lines, such as that celebrating John McGahern (or, later, an elegy for Liam Walsh). He wanders into Swedish territory briefly, but for the most part this rest of this volume stays in Ireland. Not much of the natural world is glimpsed this time. Durcan often writes for particular individuals here, and with much less attention to clerical, political, or national concerns than his previous work had done. No poems about paintings either.<br /><br />The third part, an epithalamion (as in Spenser's marriage song) commemorates his daughter's union with Mark Joyce, and is pleasant and at times intriguing. But the final section of the book drags down the satisfactory if not very rousing middle section. Cita, his latest amour, seems to have sauntered off to Thailand with another lover. Greg? Yes, that name alone should raise guffaws. But such comedy becomes only strained, as if you're watching a stand-up routine that never knows when to end. The speaker casts himself as Tulip, apparently starting an extended versified series of bovine sorrows. Maudlin, unfunny, and embarassing--its self-deprecation leaves one feeling not pity or amusement at the situation of the lovelorn that we have all shared--this segment merely wallows in its own muck, to neither the author nor the topic's gain.	2005-03-03

My earlier impression after my initial reading was one of grisliness, but on re-examining McNamee's debut (hard to believe, that), I realise that what truly makes the narrative so powerful is the withholding of such gory details from the reader. The omniscient voice does shadow in and out of various characters (to more or less similar effect--this the novel's main drawback in its monotone, if also its noirish strength), but since the characters keep the horror at a distance, so then do we, as spectators.<br /><br />This detachment differentiates McNamee's take on Belfast from the farce of Colin Bateman, the humanity of Glenn Patterson, or the tragi-comedy of Robert MacLiam Wilson, to name his peers. Atmospheric in a manner that conjures up a sodden city as grim as Dickensian London, this fits a period that now has been obliterated under new skylines, regentrified waterside developments, and tenuous ceasefires. Based on Lenny Murphy and his Shankill Butchers, the crimes they commit are not so much the focus as the aura they create, and live haunted within, as the Ulster rhetoric they pay lip service to is, as the perpetrators know, no cover for the deeper violence to which they pledge their true allegiance, even if they cannot fully articulate it.<br /><br />The subplot of the journalist Ryan, his estranged wife Margaret, his contact Coppinger, and the \\"moll\\" Heather gets a bit murky, as if McNamee did not want to fully explore the supporting characters circling about Victor Kelly. It's a little disappointing, and feels incomplete. The lack of range of registers in many of the indirect narratives of the main characters makes for a sameness in tone that works well in smaller doses, but over a couple hundred pages gets a bit wearying. This may be McNamee's intent, as the style--suffused with homiletic cadences and half-remembered biblical starkness--recalls both Joyce's Dubliners (\\"scrupulous meanness\\") and Beckett's street denizens in its carefully modulated detachment.<br /><br />[P.S.The author has published (only in Britain as of now) a novel based on Robert Nairac, an undercover James Bondish figure, Oxford student, Sandhurst grad, and SAS recruit who submerged himself inot the Provo stronghold of South Armagh--\\"The Ultras.\\" It'll be interesting to see if McNamee's historical re-visiting of the Troubles through another enigmatic --if more romanticised and articulate--figure will play out this time.]nness\\") and Beckett's street denizens in its carefully modulated detachment.<br /><br />[P.S.The author has published (only in Britain as of now) a novel based on Robert Nairac, an undercover James Bondish figure, Oxford student, Sandhurst grad, and SAS recruit who submerged himself inot the Provo stronghold of South Armagh--\\"The Ultras.\\" It'll be interesting to see if McNamee's historical re-visiting of the Troubles through another enigmatic --if more romanticised and articulate--figure will play out this time.]	2005-02-28

Once you get past the collar-grabbing effusiveness of many of the titles (they sound often like tabloid headlines or a hippie songwriter's snide put-downs), you realise the intensity of vision that goes into their making. Like many musicians, by the way, he's supposed to really make the messages come alive on stage. Not having had the opportunity, the page must suffice.<br /><br />But the sense that Durcan needs an audience to energise his skills can be conveyed here nonetheless. Although I predict many of his earlier, context-specific poems on scandals and pontifications within Irish 70s-90s society will become dated for a newer readers from a more cynical, multicultural, and secular Ireland, still--Durcan's pairing of paintings with poems, his exposure of his own vulnerability within sexual, marital, and post-marital situations, and his delight in the female, the subversive, and the exotic all establish him as a major contributor to the resurgence of contemporary Irish culture.	2005-02-24

I've never had the chance to hear him live, but reading accounts by those who have, I am struck by their common amazement--and occasional exasperation--at Durcan's earnest, if a bit wearying over the longer haul--attempts to capture the mundane and the mystic in the language of and for the average person rather than the academic.<br /><br />This refreshing attitude can put off those accustomed to more oracular countrymen like Heaney, more deliberately difficult like Muldoon, less buttonholing like Montague, or less eager like Hartnett. His sexual and emotional openness speaks to those who, unlike followers of the bardic peers that I've listed, tend to be leery of poetry and the scholarly industry churning exegetically behind it. His satirical jibes at Church and State pieties may make him dated already for a younger, post-Catholic Irish generation, but they place him boldly for his time within the opening up of Irish society in the 70s and 80s. His tendency to select the headline-grabbing title places him alongside Dylan, and his lyric bursts show that he was a fitting collaborator with Van Morrison on the album Enlightenment.<br /><br />Toibin and Fintan O'Toole give typically astute essays on the role of Durcan within the changes of his generation and nation. Eamon Grennan offers a mini-anthology of his own criticism on Durcan's various collections as they appeared; Peggy O'Brien explores a great idea: to compare his analysis of his father-son relationship with Sylvia Plath's father-daughter complications.<br /><br />Edna Longley explores Durcan and the North of Ireland issue while Ruth Padel provides an excellent, spirited piece on the \\"spin\\" within Durcan's seemingly casual craft. Bruce Woodcock's more personal recollections segue into Brian Lynch's memoirette of his days in the 60s with Durcan. Finally, Brian Kennedy shows from a curatorial stance how Durcan had studied what became the National Gallery of Ireland's \\"Crazy About Women\\" poems-paintings match-up in print and in person, while Derek Mahon, in an amusing homage to his fellow poet, first gives his send-up of a \\"Durcan poem\\" and then examines not the surrealism credited wrongly but the cubism within Durcan's art.<br /><br />Unlike many essay collections on writers, this one, with many of its respondents acting writers themselves rather than merely critics makes for a readable, down-to-earth, and no-nonsense chorus of those who admire but do not worship the man they know.<br /><br />Given that Durcan's work since this book (1996) has been more harshly received by audiences suspecting he's coasting on past glories, a follow-up volume on the past decade of Durcan, within an Ireland changing as he had celebrated and predicted--a people perhaps richer in pocket but not often enough in heart--would be equally welcome.

Village engaged me for a while, but by the time I got to Dancehall, the energy it took me to get through the thickly described prose seemed not worth the effort. I wound up skimming the rest of memoir #2. The subject matter of this one, apparently about 1965-9, when GO'B goes off to London, interested me more.<br /><br />Still, until the actual arrival of the \\"hippie era,\\" about page 65 (fittingly!) in this volume, it's again very slow going. He narrates from a stance too self-involved with recreating the nuances of thought, emotion, and introspection. The outer world in which he takes part, therefore, seems to become distanced and rather uninvolving for the reader, as it is for the author when he recalls his withdrawn nature when confronted with Swinging London. The pace does pick up once the 60s as we stereotype them kick in, but even here, the sexual lack of success and the ensuing disaffection with the whole shift in mores vs. his own frustrating dates makes for an intriguing, if difficult clash.<br /><br />Difficult because O'Brien insists upon a very allusive style that conjures up an almost Joycean amount of references, some you catch, others you don't and feel patronized by the gnomic authorial tone as a result. The lapses into French as the narrative continues don't help matters much for anglophones. He does capture the slips in and out of relationships, for friendship and/or sex, well, and the self-hatred that accompanies his own rootlessness as an Irish self-chosen exile. His Mum keeps popping up, however, which confused me more. Maybe I shouldn't have skimmed Dancehall Days?<br /><br />O'Brien takes less drugs but keeps up the booze intake, apparently, and winds up after an aborted music career (The Sunday Joint was, I agree, a far better band name than Limousine--sums up the hippies vs the yuppies to come, I'd say, in the contrast) at Ruskin College, Oxford. Here, apparently at a place for the chosen proles to advance, he sees the cost of his new education: he can never be one of the lads or one of the dons, he seems to say. (Although he later gained a PhD and tenure in the States.) He dives into Trotskyite agitation but, again, the workers to whom he peddles Red Mole seem far from his earnest ideological pose.

Pepper appeared, my memories of the hippie era are tied up with childhood. I don't idealize or denigrate the hippie era, and I was curious, after reading TC Boyle's commune novel Drop City, to discover more about what now's forty and not \\"twenty years ago\\" today, or close to it now. Miles takes a rather bi-locational look at the era 65-71 or so mostly switching between London and California. Politics are downplayed and music is highlighted, along with drugs, as the forces inspiring fashion, mores, ecology, and sexuality to change. The text may not get the attention that the photos do, but Miles tries hard to hit all of the high points within the parameters described above. A few typos (Mondo Carne, Tasahara, Berry Melton) escape the editor's eye, but I admit that he crams a lot of material into short, easily accessible mini-essays.<br /><br />One on People's Park, Berkeley effectively distills the whole conflict into a few well-written paragraphs. He gives a quick rundown on the French '68 risings, and notes how--given the lack of translations of Tim Leary, for example, the French took their radicalism more from rock n' roll from abroad to mix with Gallic activism and literary bohemianism. Miles stresses how remote the Beatles had become by the later 60s, influencing from a height what others scurried about to copy and further commodify.<br /><br />In one essay on the drug culture in SF, early '67, he captures the aftermath of the idealistic Human Be-In in January, in that night's police crackdown on \\"soft\\" drugs like pot and LSD and how as if overnight, they and their purveyors were replaced on the streets along with new dealers, of speed and heroin. Miles hints strongly that there was a concerted effort from authorities to undermine SF culture that escalated into the decline of the movement just as it looked at its most utopian, while even by the Summer of Love, the decline has become irreversible.<br /><br />Other essays, like that on the Weathermen, seem diffused, and confused--the Manson murders are celebrated by Bernadette Dohrn before the murders themselves are examined a few pages later; the SDS receives nearly no attention prior to the Chicago trial; the end years peter out into a dribble of unrelated vignettes before stumbling to a halt with Woodstock '99. One problem: many shorter entries read as if made to fit the page and the graphics, and they suddenly stop at the bottom while leaving you as the reader expecting more coverage on the non-existent next page's continuation. This staccato pace throws off the flow.<br /><br />Miles wisely stays out of the way himself in nearly all of his narrative, allowing others to be quoted at length. You do learn about personalities like Vito and Szou in '65 on the Sunset Strip, the conflict between the Family Dog and Bill Graham approaches to doing business with/as the counterculture, and the Diggers vs. HIP Haight-Ashbury merchants ideological differences. Valerie Solanas' SCUM manifesto gains citations at length, as does a key ad by Frank Zappa warning the hippies about their smug conformity. What it felt like to have Neal Cassady driving the bus, play at London's Roundhouse, be at Woodstock, or watch a light show in SF all gain credence through carefully chosen details and quotes. Alice Cooper and Led Zep are astutely credited with ushering in the death of the love generation (named by SF police chief Thomas Cahill that night after the Be-In!) and the era of the no-message, good-time arena rock that followed the earnest 60s.<br /><br />I do wish a glance at the hippie influence abroad--Brazil, Israel, Nepal, Japan, Mexico City--could have been included; the lack of international attention as well as how hippies filtered into suburban life would've been salutory. However, given the \\"heavy\\" heft of this large-format work, Miles and his photo compilers have pulled off a handsome and very inexpensively priced presentation. In summary, if you wish to see the rise and fall of the hippie ideals more from an Anglo-American rather than a global perspective, this book offers a glossy and engrossing, if not comprehensive, look at the London-California axis.n summary, if you wish to see the rise and fall of the hippie ideals more from an Anglo-American rather than a global perspective, this book offers a glossy and engrossing, if not comprehensive, look at the London-California axis.	2005-02-15

Harbison's chapters are well-written, summarizing the highlights yet largely free of jargon or arcana. It not only would grace a table or suit as a marvelous gift, but should be in libraries (where I found it) as a resource for those who cannot travel to the places or see up-close the intricate craft that a large-format book with excellent photographs offers. You can examine the filigree on the Ardagh chalice better here than in person at the National Museum, for example! Such often overlooked subjects as late medieval friaries gain sufficient attention here as well to stimulate the reader to more study or visits.<br /><br />My only criticism is very minor, but the vexed question of the extent of the Celtic incursions artistically and demographically into Ireland appears to be muddled in Harbison's account. A clearer explanation of the academic debate over this issue would have clarified for the general reader the latest thought on this topic. Overall, however, a handsome and carefully organized book, from Newgrange to Harry Clarke, again, stunning illustrations capture the allure of millennia of art and culture.	2005-02-10

I've always wondered how a city's fans respond to players drawn from the whole planet playing for passionately tribal crowds, and Foer gives an accessible account of, as in the Nigerians playing for Ukraine's Lviv Karpaty, how this exchange occurs.<br /><br />The Italian, Brazilian, Celtic-Rangers, and Chelsea chapters disappointed me a bit. The lesson that countries play as their ideologies dictate is fascinating, and I think this could've been highlighted even more throughout the book as a guiding metaphor. It's more workable than--as Foer hints a forward about contrasting globalization pre- and post-9/11--the capitalist-expanding markets theory, which is unwieldy when Foer has to come up with a jumble of its positives and negatives. Congrats, however, on his correctly dissing Juventus and Man U as the types of teams that are bought and play more as commodities or true \\"franchises\\" than many of their rivals. The whole marketing aspect and corporate tie-ins arise throughout the narrative, but lack in-depth investigation, which I think would have been more engrossing than rather pedestrian coverage of Brazil and Italy's power struggles behind the teams, of all places in the world. these two football giants are made mundane here.<br /><br />The Rangers coverage, for example, does not rise above the commonplace except when covering the first nominally Catholic player for the Rangers in the 90s. The transfer to Ulster of the sectarian rivalry is carefully explained, in that the North of Ireland since 1949 lacks a \\"Catholic\\" team on the prominent level, but Foer seems to have spent little time here as his quick take on Belfast is only that of thousands of previous reporters.<br /><br />His Barca enthusiasm comes through, and reminds me of Nick Hornby's Arsenal love-hate affair chronicled in Fever Pitch. Elsewhere, looks into the Jewish connection to football teams shows a fresh angle, but even here, ending with only an aside on MTK Budapest leaving that chapter dangling and weakened. The section on the American lack of support for the game shows clever observations but its brevity, unlike seemingly endless chapters on Italy and Brazil, makes the book's end anti-climactic.<br /><br />All in all, this book raises in short bursts more excitement than its thesis can sustain. Foer's better taken in small doses than an extended book, and this volume feels like an anthology of pieces rather than a full-fledged study of an admittedly great topic that he was lucky to take on. I only wish more of his personal passion for the game, shown in the Barca segment, enlivened the rest of what too often sags into feature articles that could've been reprinted from any thoughtful sports writer.is only that of thousands of previous reporters.  <br /> <br />His Barca enthusiasm comes through, and reminds me of Nick Hornby's Arsenal love-hate affair chronicled in Fever Pitch.

This, as later accounts reiterate, was in fact an attempt to make for socialism a more human face, and was not an anti-Communist rebellion so much a popular uprising against Stalinist/Soviet occupation and collaboration in the wake of Khruschev's denunciation of Uncle Joe and Polish student/worker calls for a more liberal shift in Warsaw Bloc policy. While U.S. Cold War propaganda tried to capitalize on the rebellion to make it an anti-Red one, in fact Radio Free Europe only worsened the plight of the revolutionaries by falsely raising the hopes of the embattled and trapped freedom fighters. The role of Imre Nagy is muddled here; Gadney interprets that he was more of a figurehead caught between the rebel's radical demands that he could not satisfy and the puppet regime's hold over their former prisoner and the nascent Hungarian transitional committees that had no real time to establish power before the Soviets' duplicitious crushing of the uprising. Janos Kadar gets off pretty lightly in Gadney's rather sympathetic portrayal, as one who turned tail and fled so as to save not only his own hide but allow an eventual semi-liberal economy, by Soviet standards, to emerge in later decades in Hungary--by the time of Gadney's interpretation. Given that all involved at any level were familiar with Stalinism, the decisions made to keep surviving the purges by individuals, in retrospect, cannot be faulted but being human ones, if less than ideal and moral, then those of frightened and weak people knowing how cruelly the Soviets would treat any who crossed them.<br /><br />As journalists reported from Budapest, naturally, nearly all of the book studies the capital's resistance to the Soviets, with very little balance from the rest of the nation. Given the information restrictions pre-the fall of the Wall, however, and the post-1989 regimes' continued prevarication even 50 years later about the role of informers (estimated by Gadney at one in ten of the population) and the role of spies and the AVO, this less than complete panorama of what occurred in October/November 1956 may not be so surprising to veteran students of or veterans from Hungary since WWII.<br /><br />The Western powers, as documented well here, diddled away at the Suez Canal and ignored Hungary's appeals, leaving the scene as more of an sudden bloody spill behind the Iron Curtain for the Russians to mop up. Most books printed in the West offer few photos on the revolt; this is a welcome exception. John Sadovy's snapshots published here, originally for Life magazine, of young fighters and the execution of AVO secret police as they were driven from their headquarters make up the most dramatic of the excellent array of photos here.<br /><br />For English-language beginners to the events of 1956 needing to fill up on more than the bare bones narrative here, go to Sandor Kopesci's (Budapest's police chief) memoir of the revolt and his imprisonment along with many of the other leaders, \\"In The Name of the Working Class.\\" Also recommended is a photo history of the subsequent Kadar regime, \\"Unfinished Socialism,\\" and Tibor Fischer's novel of 1944-56, \\"Under the Frog.\\"post-1989 regimes' continued prevarication even 50 years later about the role of informers (estimated by Gadney at one in ten of the population) and the role of spies and the AVO, this less than complete panorama of what occurred in October/November 1956 may not be so surprising to veteran students of or veterans from Hungary since WWII.  <br /> <br />The Western powers, as documented well here, diddled away at the Suez Canal and ignored Hungary's appeals, leaving the scene as more of an sudden bloody spill behind the Iron Curtain for the Russians to mop up.

How Conservatives Won the Heart of America	Books	3	12	19	N	N	Full of ideas, yet draws out too limply his thesis	My family all turned Reagan Democrats, I did not. Regardless of their own affiliation, my students now weary of the race/culture/class wars, my \\"white ethnic\\" blue-collar memories (I'm four years older than Frank) are too recent to recall any LBJ Great Society or its post-war affluence. So, I was eager--after being wowed by the Harper's Magazine precis of his book--to find out more. The trouble is that Frank rarely talks to everyday people--like those represented by my father, sister, in-laws, students--who made the switch away from a class-based capitalist-wary to a values-based, pro-corporate worldview.<br /><br />As he admits, parsing Ann Coulter's prose does little to expose the intellectual weaknesses of arguments based more on resentment than reason. Frank carefully dissects many pundits' pronouncements, yet the effect leaves me too detached from the grassroots reactions that fuel this season of prairie fire. When Frank admits a bit of admiration for Tim Golba's sincerity and committment to his anti-abortion crusade, this becomes a refreshing bit of candor and gives a personal touch to what too often, especially in later chapters about religion and race, sags into pro-forma mainstream left-leaning journalism. The chapter on sedevacantist offshoots of Catholicism, for example, drags down one on anti-intellectualism. Too much speculation and too few talks with true believers who react to what the pundits and politicians pontificate keep the book as a whole removed from the Kansas that Frank knows but has difficulty conveying to us far from \\"Cupcake Land\\" and its endless, raw strip malls, retail chains, and ticky-tacky McMansions.<br /><br />Many who responded to Frank's original piece thought that he had overlooked the loss of the culture war by the Democrats. It'll be interesting, in the probable updated forward to a post-2004 election paperback edition, how Frank will see his thesis vindicated once again. The latter pages do castigate the Dems for their hubris and condescension, but even here, you feel like the narrative--how did so many blue-collar folks desert the left--lacks enough attention at the voter level to this process. Frank focuses more on the leaders rather than the led in this movement over the last three decades, and for me at least, this detracts from the full insight that he could have found when investigating the loss of the blue-collar vote.<br /><br />When I tried reading Frank's The Baffler years back, I was baffled. Too po-mo. His craft has improved, but as one who penned Commodify Your Dissent, his claim that the film/TV/corporate media is not left-leaning but merely in it for the money, while true on the profit end, does seem to let the whole Hollywood-NYC latte set off the hook when it comes to their disdain for the common people. Yes, creative types do generally go left and to the coastal cities. With relatives in the film industry, and me living in L.A, I can attest that even at a much lower rank of the cultural pecking order, there's lots of disdain that comes from those in the media, who give as good as they get in turn from the right-wing backlash. This, in fact, has been credited in the exurbs to strengthening the clout of the right in 2004, since so many commuters listen to talk radio longer and longer on their daily drives to their own versions of \\"Cupcake Land\\" and its dustier subdivisions. Frank could have looked into this relationship in terms of his media manufacturing analysis, which appears jumbled and too compressed here to be convincing.<br /><br />In condensed form, as in the Harper's article, this analysis packed a punch. Here, in a book that despite its largish print and 250 pp. of text seems padded (although many of his 40 pp. of denser footnotes are well-written and show his research off nicely), Frank's argument loses its energy.sion, but even here, you feel like the narrative--how did so many blue-collar folks desert the left--lacks enough attention at the voter level to this process.

US	53087372	RFDGIEG2A4ZKO	1900850486	873523784	Deposition of Father Mcgreevy	Books	2	4	5	N	N	Promising material, but falters in its delivery	It's a unsettling, slightly-off, prose style that tilts this tale for the reader. The invention of Maginn editorializing Father McG's deposition makes for a handy device to convey what most readers today, if not well-versed (in more ways than one) would miss in the Irish references. The priest's account, however, goes on far, far too long. Nobody would blather this much if explaining the gist of what happened up on the mountain.<br /><br />Promotion for this novel plays up the tragedies in the hamlet as if they are shocking; others in the tale tell the priest that they really aren't much at all, given isolated men without women. The whole opposition of the men to those who wish to examine the fate (I'm skirting a plot spoiler) of their wives seems, even for 1940s Eire, to be \\"protesting too much.\\" Surely the men would want to find out what happened and put an end to any further contagion? The priest, Maginn, the doctors, and therefore O'Doherty all hint at this more rational reaction, and I found myself with no sympathy for the mountain men, although I doubt if this was the authorial intent. Their plight became increasingly, with Biddy's meddling, tiresome, and I could not believe either that a priest could be expected, even with the thousands of clergy in Ireland then, to be let alone to continue to care for such a tiny parish. The Blaskets parallels repeat throughout the book, and they outnumbered the handful in the Kerry settlement. I was reminded of an area called the Black Valley in the county that only got electrified very late, and was noted as a rather haunted locale. Also, by the way, seeing O'Doherty studies and practices art, there's a double meaning to deposition that comes from the taking down of the corpus of Christ from the cross--perhaps this relates to the symbolic fate of Father McGreevy? I felt his pain, but as a character he remained rather too inert on the page, amidst so many words for so little actual effect. This could have been a fine novella, but O'Doherty, like the priest, seems overfond of his own voice.<br /><br />The sheer extravagance of the stage Irish talk of the characters has been commented upon by other reviewers. This is unfortunate; the first two dozen pages contained careful, evocative prose, and the priest's description of giving Extreme Unction to the dying summoned up powerfully the force of spiritual healing into a weakened physical, human struggle. This theme continues within the larger story, but the detachment not only due to Maginn's footnotes but the lack of any narrative foil--the police documenting the prolix clergyman's endless verbalizing could have intervened to keep the reader at least on edge. After hundreds of pages of crafted but rather artificial Irish voices, one wishes for a shake-up that, despite Maginn's briefer interviews with others appended to the main deposition, never really happens.<br /><br />The suggestions of interfering with the otherworld gain credence as an alternate explanation late in the novel, but the rush of these musings comes too little too late. It's too muted after the enormous weight and lengthy drone of the priest's steady, unfaltering, and slightly but persistently unconvincing attempts--via the author, of course--to give the priest and his informants their own voices rather than a neutered, forced attempt at what O'Doherty seems to think readers outside Ireland imagine rural people--at least half a century ago--sounded like.<br /><br />For a more effectively rendered tone about the vanished rural Ireland of the middle of the 20c, try John McGahern's novels and stories. Eddie Lenihan, a modern Co. Clare seanachie, edits and comments upon oral testimony about encounters of Irish people with otherworldly forces in his Meeting the Other Side.

Because it deals with adolescence rather than the horrors to befall \\"Ferdinand\\" the author's alter ego in Journey, this book makes for a lighter and more entertaining read. The first half lists the smells and sights of the Passage where he grew, the toil for his parents and then working peddling the Gorloges' \\"manias of a whole insane asylum served up as trinkets\\", ensuing bad sex with the Madame G., off to England for a twist on the Dickensian orphan-cum-Edwardian schoolboy saga. Then, back to France for first Paris and then the sticks as Ferdinand works and swindles alongside the des Pereires couple. He's a mad scientist obsessed with tellurically grown tubers, she's a manic counterpart crazed by her own and her husband's hot air--in more ways than one.<br /><br />The pace moves this book very quickly. Compared to the later Castle by Castle, you can see in Death the origins of the elliptical, staccato style of his later, post-WWII novels. Yet, lacking the despair if not the pessimism of the 1950s efforts, Death still carries a sassiness that makes it an easier read and less bitter to savor. Compared to the earlier Journey, the freshness of youth carries the reader more nimbly through the passages relating wonderfully the stench of being seasick, starving, pants full of excrement, stealing, and sexually randy. This book lacks the gravity of the other works by Celine, but would probably, more than Journey, be the place to start.<br /><br />Yes, the constant negativism does drag the book down if you're an optimist, but then, why would someone who always looks on the bright side of life be attracted to the dark side of comedy anyhow? The narrator, like the author, knows he's a jerk, little better than the rest of failed humanity. The hundreds of pages spent with Courtial des Pereires, in their manic schemes and unrestrained rhetoric, speak of the joy of the crazy dreams we all harbor and their manipulation by those just a bit more avaricious and crafty than the rest of us. The human comedy Celine sketches here, in riotious crowd scenes and gustatory excess being at his most accessible, makes for a spirited encounter with the world, just before 1914 changed it--and the narrator and his author--all again.their manic schemes and unrestrained rhetoric, speak of the joy of the crazy dreams we all harbor and their manipulation by those just a bit more avaricious and crafty than the rest of us.

Sorry, but I can't share the five-star enthusiasm of some reviewers. It's no match for Death or Journey. I've examined a fair amount of and about Celine before this installment. For style, unlike Journey, the whole book's elliptical, which does make for a fast perusal! It's a strange pace at which to read the account, for your eyes scan it much more rapidly than the usual sentence/block/paragraph/indented dialogue/he said-she said-quote format.<br /><br />For this innovation, Celine's postwar prose merits attention. But, at 63, the author had declined, as he acknowledges to us, \\"you aren't interested in this kind of s*&t anyway\\"...before launching back into his ramblings. The titular castle's not arrived at until pg. 124, and the previous tirades against his publishers and public dispirit you before this main \\"plot\\" begins. Even the orgies with pregnant women and slavering soldiers remain diffused. Little of the detail of earlier works is offered here, other than a brief survey of the labyrinthine Hohollenzern chateau/castle--despite the English title, this is the only edifice of Celine's story. As with his other prose, characters rise and fade quickly and without fanfare. Clotilde and Parmalac and the chained returnee, Aisha and her mastiffs, Restif and his cryptic plans all arouse attention, but all of them vanish too suddenly.<br /><br />If you like Celine, you need to read this, but this'll test your earlier enthusiasm. He will not earn your pity when he justifies his suffering as greater than that of the Hungarian uprising as he wrote this in 1956. A memoir (translated by Francis Stuart--see his own Black List Section H for an intriguing counterpart of \\"creative non-fiction\\" to Celine) on the Charlemagne regiment of French that fought against the Bolshies for the Nazis near the end of the war, Ashes of Honour (British translation's title) or The Captive Dreamer (US title) by Christian de la Maziere is recommended for its more coherent account of the drama within which, in Celine's static locale, collaborators found themselves as the Reich began its collapse.<br /><br />It's noteworthy that I was more moved, as was Celine as narrator here perhaps, by his description of his dog and cat than by any of the humans referred to in their plight. You come away with little sense of the 1,172 refugees in this castle but lots of details of the effects of kohlrabi soup and sour beer on the digestive and sewer systems. In the end, Celine had to write and was driven to tell whatever his impulse made him speak, but the results after the war attest to his decline and increasingly deep rut, which are unsurprising but still aesthetically dulling.Honour (British translation's title) or The Captive Dreamer (US title) by Christian de la Maziere is recommended for its more coherent account of the drama within which, in Celine's static locale, collaborators found themselves as the Reich began its collapse.

The plot with Konny and David never holds any surprises, and the trajectory of the novel rarely rises above the mundane. Full of detail about the ship and the three men who intersected to bring about its tragic end, you find much to learn about the times, but this could have been a better non-fictional work of journalism by Grass. The clumsy author-narrator dichotomy appears listless, and the Grandmother talks, in the translation of her Low German, like some intellectual's attempt at Ma Kettle.<br /><br />A true account such as Guy Sajer's The Forgotten Soldier or a history such as Anthony Beevor's The Fall of Berlin, 1945 give context that readers curious about the collapse of the Baltic front will gain much from. Grass' short novella fails to convince as fiction, even if much of it is borrowed from--and better left as--fact to confront and contend with and against.	2005-01-21

The professor writes clearly, without jargon, and incisively. His sentences simply declare his findings, and the book flows well. McCarthy diligently has surveyed every scrap relating to Celine/Destouches, and he alternates chapters on the reality--as best as can be reconstructed--and the fictions that Celine built out of his experiences and his imagination. Certainly, more than many other authors, these two realms overlap willfully due to Celine's penchant for revising his own life even as he lived it!<br /><br />A great strength of this study is how McCarthy places Celine's impact within the larger intellectual, literary, and political currents of the era. His knowledge of Beckett especially sheds much light upon Celine's analogous characters. At times, the circumstantial detail overwhelmed me, as this dense context depends upon a better knowledge of French rivalries and movements in the 1930s/40s than I (or I imagine less specialised readers) possess. This is no fault of McCarthy, but the reliance upon an enormously complicated set of machinations around French collaboration, fascist and far-right activity, existentialism, and party and partisan strife makes for a heady background added to an already challenging Celinian effort on paper and in person during these confusing decades.<br /><br />As his biographer stresses throughout, the pamphleteer and the novelist cannot be separated, but the work done in each genre can be relegated at least to different shelves, and analyzed accordingly. The good and the bad, the noble and the skulking are as mixed in Celine as in all of us, and those who patronisingly condemn him too often echo the calculated revisionism of many in post-war France who claimed, contrarily, that they--of course--were always on the side of the Resistants.<br /><br />Celine's refusal to placate any side made him a pariah by all, and he liked this role. He's infuriating, and the decline in his prose despite its energy and brio depresses as the biography continues into the 1950s. Still, as ever, he refused to capitulate. That he died hours after he finished the draft of his final novel, Rigadoon, seems appropriate. Also that by then the self-righteous opprobium he sought and earned yet did not fully deserve (a typically Celinean stance) insured his end gained far less attention than Hemingway's suicide the same day. Celine courted and incited his foes, and then bewailed their attacks. He may have been mistaken and proud of his stubborn, sometimes inchoate mentality, but he did manage to prove himself a modernist: he defied any standard, any restriction, any PC-stance, to his doom or his credit, or, as McCarthy would judge, both.tants.  <br /> <br />Celine's refusal to placate any side made him a pariah by all, and he liked this role.

US	53087372	RNER08GSLL8QW	0306808986	93088102	Samuel Beckett: The Last Modernist	Books	5	16	18	N	N	Exhaustively researched but never exhausting to read	If you seek to understand how a product of the Irish Protestant middle class a century ago managed at an early age to overthrown any certainty brought about by such an upbringing, Cronin offers surmises to this and hundreds of other puzzles in the reticent Foxrock native's life. For a man who so esteemed silence, the impossibility of words to match our inner experiences and their outer raiments, Cronin's herculean cleaning out of the Augean stables, the poring through every scrap penned by Beckett, results in an extraordinarily thorough but never exhausting account ranging six hundred closely printed pages.<br /><br />As an adopted Dubliner, and as a working writer for fifty years, Cronin adds here to his earlier successes that pondered  literary failure, or at least mediocrity, in what passed for bohemian life in the Irish capital of the postwar decade, 1945-55, Dead as Doornails, and in his life of Flann O'Brien/Myles na gCopaleen/Brian O Nolan, No Laughing Matter. Both of these have been reissued recently, and I recommend them to readers curious about how talent can drown its sorrows in too much whisky and its potential in too much talk with too little discipline. While this pair illustrates many anecdotes riotously rendered, the cumulative effect of the two accounts makes for sobering cautionary tales, and how the ghost of Joyce lingered long over last century.<br /><br />How Beckett managed to extricate himself from the early dominance of Joyce when the two met and depended upon each other however fleetingly in Paris makes for engrossing storytelling. What I noted most of all was how Cronin, through scouring Beckett's records, depicts an author amazingly crippled by maladies mostly psychosomatic, by imagined fears, by phobias befitting indeed his future characters. It takes until 1950 or so for this author, now in his mid-forties, to begin to enter into the period, after `the long siege in the room,' where he could come out of his shell and wrestle with his demons. Having fought, at first for the French Resistance (if his rather circumspect accomplishments fell less than dazzlingly in the Hollywood sense, his danger was no less real and the fate of his comrades no less fatal) and then against his interior desolation, he only then could become, well into middle age, the leader of the avant-garde we know him as, the creator of Godot and Endgame, Krapp and Malone, Molloy and Worm, Winnie and Gogo.<br /><br />In this brief overview of Cronin's tome, no quotes. But, for anyone needing an excellent pr&eacute;cis of what Beckett achieved, chapters 23 and 24 in my estimation serve as a thoughtful and by no means uncritical survey of how Beckett set up scaffolds, erected his plots, and then demolished as much of the structure as the work could stand and still survive.<br /><br />Of course, his later rather dead-end prose such as How It Is and his tinier plays, or dramaticules, produced as the 1960s and 70s found him caught within the expectations of comedians, scholars, analysts, and audiences, the productions shrank as he seemingly had less to say. As Beckett, at the start of his career, noted of Joyce, the elder Irishman strove to cram the whole of existence into the written word, while his successor sought to eliminate as much of the words and still capture the whole of the same human condition. Two contrasting approaches, intersected by the love of language, the compulsion to manufacture it, and the doubt in any higher purpose than that of the artist driven to create and depict and narrate.<br /><br />Cronin's energy never flags. I happily measured how well he paces his own story. Godot appears only about 2/3 of the way through, and Cronin never stints on the earlier, more embarrassing malingering of the younger Beckett that presaged his rise to fame and irritated his naturally reclusive nature. His generousity, often remarked upon by those who knew and/or studied him, left many in his debt. Winning the Nobel Prize in 1969, heescaped on an extended holiday and gave away the prize money to a list of deserving up-and-coming writers. One bought a sports car with her windfall.<br /><br />Cronin, as one who knew and at least once offended Beckett, offers a counterpart to Damned by Fame, which appeared (as biographers often find) immediately prior to his own volume in 1996. James Knowlson, the keeper of the Beckett archive at the University of Reading (where a year's concentration and cash can earn you a MA in Beckett Studies), brought out the authorised biography, with more of the typical trajectory beloved by screenwriters, with Beckett's earlier, more derivatively jaunty, Joycean, or jejune scribblings preparing the way for a blossoming into challenging, disturbing, and, yes, humourous sketches of frailty, despair, and hope.<br /><br />For Cronin, Beckett's less a secular saint than a hypochondriacal mum's boy who, after coddling and a preparation for respectability, lived the life of the Irish exile (who kept decamping to London and even Dublin often enough) and finally had to grow up, support himself, and push his resources to plumb the darkness within. Out of this, he made stunningly evocative prose, for my tastes some of the best in the 20th century in English, full of cadences that, in the restricted French that he chose so as to limit himself to a harsher diet than that afforded the luxuriant Hiberno-English consumer, ghosted Irishisms, summoned English at its best, and shone through French.69, he escaped on an extended holiday and gave away the prize money to a list of deserving up-and-coming writers.

US	53087372	R2X92JJZPIIGIK	0838755739	721039391	Naming Beckett's Unnamable	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Kafka, the Holocaust, excavating into B's narratives	Gary Adelman, a professor at the University of Illinois, offers a much-needed serial explication of the later prose, too often overlooked in favor of the drama. He writes engagingly and accessibly, and his passion comes through clearly. Often overshadowed by Martin Esslin's mislabelling of Beckett as among the ranks of the existentialist-inspired \\"theatre of the absurd\\" of Ionesco, Sartre, and mid-century French rivals, the fictions Beckett hammered out of his skull onto paper from 1946-50 that became known as the \\"trilogy\\" of Molloy, Malone Dies, and The Unnameable announces a spectacular performance of its own. He wrote Godot as a witty break from the rigours of forming the last book of these three, so you can imagine how difficult this process might have been!<br /><br />Adelman starts by looking over the four short stories Beckett wrote after the war, known as the Nouvelles, and then dives into the trilogy. Some of his book has been published as a series of articles in the earlier '00's, and these portions do not seem to have been changed. I had heard about his argument that The Unnameable contains testimony of a Holocaust survivor before I first read that novel; as with any attempt to package Beckett into compartments, Adelman's connection works as well as can be expected. He makes a convincing point, but since the trilogy itself reaches towards its own narrative dissolution, no voice in it--especially by the third installment--can be reduced to a single \\"character\\" for long.<br /><br />Adelman, clearly honed by decades in the classroom, attacks the prose and chips away at its edifice. He uncovers the lineaments of care and craft to argue for-beneath the experimental narrative style-redemption within. I agree here, contrary to many who have delved into the same shafts, that Beckett cannot be placed totally within the atheist camp. He, like Joyce, wavered. He lived and died, honestly, among the uncertain.<br /><br />Furthermore, the attention paid by the critic to torture within the prose might underscore the appeal Beckett's works have had for prisoners. When I encountered Beckett's final installment, after which he could truly go no further (How It Is being I think an aborted try), I tested Adelman's reading (known to me from an earlier article) against my fresh one. It works for some of the novel, but as the narrative itself fractures, one narrator is not enough to address the impact of the Shoah. Adelman realises that his efforts to extract strivings for the sacred out of what many readers have determined to be godless texts has its limits, and he appeals to Kafka for support, a similarly tenuous figure for the past century's spiritual seekers and deniers.<br /><br />I just finished Anthony Cronin's biography of Beckett, and in its 600 pages I could not find any direct statement by Sam on Franz. In James Knowlson's biography, three citations emerge: in 1982, he'd been reading K, and mentions his diary once; nearer his death he had Kafka near his bedside shelf. Both Beckett's biographers, therefore, document no primary connection by K made by SB in the period Adelman covers, 1946-70, but, of course, this is not to discount K's influence. Adelman cites a NY Times interview with Israel Shenker from 1956 in which Beckett discusses his reading of Kafka, and it's a bit surprising that this eluded or was elided by both Cronin and Knowlson. Considering that Knowlson and John Pilling in an earlier work derided looking to Kafka as an analogue for Beckett, or that \\"In the Penal Colony\\" unlocks, as Adelman insists, \\"The Lost Ones.\\"<br /><br />In such a comparison, Adelman must rely on a lot of \\"might have been\\" and \\"had in common\\" to support his thesis. For such a thin book, a great deal of it previously published in journals. Adleman spends many pages summarizing Kafka before he can return to Beckett. While this is convenient for the reader, I did feel like I wanted chapters more solidly rooted in tangible, proven relationships established intentionally by Beckett that derived from Kafka rather than suppositions, however helpful they were to Adelman in unlocking the secrets within Beckett's mature prose.<br /><br />However, critics apply Marx and Freud and Derrida and Jesus to all sorts of texts no matter the direct inspiration, and Adelman makes his points without jargon, trendiness, or special pleading. His concern to express himself clearly and carefully means he does not pad his pages with theoretical blather or secondhand insights. For an advanced reader of Beckett, a recommended work that corrects earlier takes on the author and suggests new perspectives. For an author as scrutinized as Beckett, to come up with fresh enthusiasms as Adelman has makes for intriguing and thoughtful re-encounters with knotty texts.relationships established intentionally by Beckett that derived from Kafka rather than suppositions, however helpful they were to Adelman in unlocking the secrets within Beckett's mature prose.  <br /> <br />However, critics apply Marx and Freud and Derrida and Jesus to all sorts of texts no matter the direct inspiration, and Adelman makes his points without jargon, trendiness, or special pleading.

As we read on pg. 189: \\"What with being chucked out of everywhere, you're sure to find whatever it is that scares all those bastards so. It must be the end of the night, and that's why they're so dead set against going to the end of the night.\\" The start reminds me of the post-WWI antiwar novel by Remarque, \\"All Quiet on the Western Front,\\" or the later Dalton Trumbo screed \\"Johnny Got His Gun.\\" The African section energizes a Conradian \\"Heart of Darkness\\" by bringing in more recognizably human characters rather than archetypes. Sergeant Alcide and the family bringing their rubber to trade at the store both leap off the page, and what Chinua Achebe has labored for many chapters to convey here becomes conveyed dramatically, ironically, and memorably in much fewer paragraphs.<br /><br />The American episodes recalled for me Kafka's \\"Amerika\\" with their mix of comedy and confusion amidst industrial and urban freneticism. Celine anticipates Orwell's \\"Down and Out in Paris and London,\\" which Eric Blair was exploring at the same time, roughly, as the latter part of Celine's epic. The return to France, not even halfway through the book, and the subsequent medical pursuits, arrive at not even the halfway point of the book, and you wonder how the plot (such as it is) will continue.<br /><br />The humanism does reoccur, if sporadically, and every page contains aphoristic wisdom, often wittily if no less honestly uttered by Ferdinand. I'd like to find out, after reading this, how much \\"really\\" happened to Celine and how much was invented or revamped. I suppose, more than most authors, that the ties between reality and imagination on the page are drawn tighter than usual, in the style of \\"autobiographical fiction\\" like Francis Stuart's \\"Black List, Section H,\\" by another author who found himself pursuing for the sake of artistic integrity less than popular stances during WWII. No surprise, as I'm reading Anthony Cronin's Beckett bio, that Sam was influenced by Celine, too. As such a work of uneasy inspiration from a raucous mind, Celine's craft might fall short of the formal perfection expected from the highest caliber of \\"classic\\" authors, but he errs for honesty's sake. He castigates modernism and transcends it. Instead, he pioneers existentialist 20c statements that challenge the primacy or the substitution of art for God.<br /><br />I understand that Celine's later works fall much more into this darker zone between self-justification and self-release by prose. This novel was worth every long moment it took. It flows rapidly, yet demands close attention, curiously. You cannot enter into the mind of Ferdinand without being shaken up, and the author's narrative voice demands your full engagement. A bracing and novel, to use the French and the English terms, experience.

His talent is enormous, his ambition's contagious, his ideas are fertile as ever. But does he have the discipline to make it into the highest ranks, whose eminence I believe he can reach if he toughens up his attitude? He's the boy who likes to act the rebel, the drop-out he once was, but all along he has the makings of the PhD he became. This contrariness still simmers.<br /><br />As others have noted about Drop City, Boyle's talent shines, but he's capable of much more. I do find that his ironic style has in recent work subsided a bit, giving way to measured compassion in his stories, such as many of those in After the Plague. One of the stories in that collection dealt with a serial test of potential mates in Alaska, which may be the origin of what here is the Sess and Pamela plot.<br /><br />[...]. His love of boastful fakes and the ensuing macho punchouts continues here as in his other fiction, but it does get tedious even if he's good at it. I have taught his story \\"Greasy Lake\\" to college students, and much as I enjoy his bravura narrative in small doses, it can become \\"testiduneous\\"(to use a word from GL I found again in DC) over the long haul.<br /><br />The two brawling contingents, hippie \\"grasshoppers\\" and sourdough \\"ants,\\" do not even meet until the 280's in pagination. Lots of exposition precedes, often the most interesting feature of Boyle's writing being the details: how a commune tries to feed the folks, how you trap wolves, what a dark winter feels like in Alaska, how hippies need foodstamps and welfare to \\"live off the land.\\" If you let your eye fall upon individual paragraphs, you'll find nearly invariably well-crafted, energetic, restless prose, which itches to leap off the page free of cliche, full of fresh metaphors and clever observations. Problem is, the book's structure flits from character to character in its indirect narration, and the omniscient voice of the controlling speaker filters only sporadically through a cast of sometimes insufficiently differentiated people whom you find not enough empathy for.<br /><br />Sess and Pamela and Marco earn the author and thus the reader's sympathy, but Boyle's much better at male than female \\"consciousness.\\" So, after a few hundred pages of calculatedly witty insights, the reader may well weary of being so much inside other people's heads without a whole lot of dialogue or relief from the omnipresent buzz of inner monologue. It's a pattern common to much of Boyle's ouevre, where his strength of commentary and his weakness of sneering coalesce.<br /><br />I'm as pessimistic as the next faux-misanthrope, but while Boyle has progressed in his ability to care for his fictional humans despite our real clumsiness and hormones and ideals and hypocrisies, this novel fails ultimately to live up to its promise. I'm glad I read it, having learned a lot about the \\"how-to\\" issue of the time and places, and I wish Boyle well as he continues to improve. If he was a rookie, this'd be a remarkable season. Two decades on, this veteran still has to fulfill his potential with a bases-loaded home run. He can do it, but he has not yet.

Like John Banville's recent \\"Prague Pictures,\\" it offers one author's own perspective. If you have not been to Prague, the cityscape conjured up here will be elusively imagined as you read Goldberg's energetic digressions. Having lived there a decade ago, when the formerly cheap cost-of-living lured Westerners, she brings no autobiographical recollections but a sense of the savvier long-term resident. She avoids many of the familiar tourist sites such as the Jewish quarter, Hradcany and the Castle, and the Charles Bridge. She favors, as this series stresses, the off-beat locales.<br /><br />It's a quick verbal repast, edible in one or two sittings. Like dumplings and alcohol (as she notes after three decades of this diet the sudden, irreversible transition from ruddy youth to slumped middle-agers among its citizens), it fills you up for the moment but leaves you wanting more nutritious content soon after. She notices a lot more graffiti than I did, but offers insights about the pedestals and skateboarders that remain after the statues topple. (I'm surprised she did not visit the park where the statues loll on display for tourists.) Goldberg marvels too much at the system whereby the Metro's riders go on the honor system amidst plainclothes fare-checkers--maybe as a Brooklynite she finds this unbelievable? She helpfully lets you know that both the Strahov and Clementinum libraries rope off or keep at a distance from casual visitors much of what beckons enticingly from brochures. The chapter on the bell-ringing at noon sags into archness, however, and that on the nondescript suburb of New Karlin post-flood also adds little to the volume.<br /><br />That on the Strahov's curious cabinets of wonder, by its title, echoes Laurence Wechsler on LA's Museum of Jurassic Technology. It tells you pretty much all you need to know about this once-monastic library, and what in fact can (and mostly cannot) be seen by visitors. Apparently, as with many sights seen through Goldberg's point-of-view, they are better envisioned by armchair travellers rather than in person!<br /><br />Anti-war protests against the second Iraqi invasion seem so recent that it's a bit of a jolt to find a couple of protests by American ex-pats and the Euro-left already committed to bound pages. Goldberg, with her basic command of Czech, uncovers some of the ironies and miscommunications as the Yanks earnestly try to convince the Czechs about their common opposition in a city so marked by popular protests in past decades. (A small mistake on pg. 82: she gives 1944 as the date for a four-day savagely fought uprising against the Nazis when in fact it was just before liberation in early May 1945.)<br /><br />Her chapter on falling into the clutches of the police for a pedestrian infraction is by far the best part of the book. The theatrical nature of the Czech character enacted in public, aided or weakened by Goldberg's limited skill in the cops' own language, only adds to the confrontation and its complications. Here, she's excellent at casting herself in an impromptu role!<br /><br />Then, brief excursions to Karel Capek's grave at Vysehrad and Kafka's at the New Jewish Cemetery (about the only mention of this topic in these pages) add poignancy but appear anticlimactic after the previous chapter, which should've ended the collection.<br /><br />The final chapters, one on the parks along the shore north of the city, another on pubs and clubs and drunks, offer little noteworthy outside of the proclivity for Czechs either to have amazing bladder control (especially considering the bargain price for superb beer) or a tendency to avoid the old lady manning the jakes. This observation dovetails into her earlier related response to fearsome matrons guarding Strahovian artifacts which could have been models for Lewis Carroll's bestiary : \\"Officiousness is one pre-glasnost keepsake Prague is loath to disown--it is one of the few pleasures working-class Czechs can still afford.\\" (71)<br /><br />All in all, a nervous reverie for those who have visited or have no intention of visiting the city. But not for those who have yet to travel there. Best to check out standard guides, talk to veteran itinerants, and read \\"Prague Walks\\" and Ivan Klima's essays collected as \\"The Spirit of Prague.\\" Goldberg, like her book-jacket picture reveals as its contents affirm, remains too showy an interpreter--she dresses in black, but the loudly-striped leggings give her away instead of camouflaging her presence.iary : \\"Officiousness is one pre-glasnost keepsake Prague is loath to disown--it is one of the few pleasures working-class Czechs can still afford.\\" (71) <br /> <br />All in all, a nervous reverie for those who have visited or have no intention of visiting the city.

US	53087372	R1XCI5OBJGEGSD	0385474547	672855451	Things Fall Apart	Books	3	9	11	N	N	Very slowly paced, challenging despite its plain surface	This novel has been assigned for the intro to literature course I teach to technical college students, most of whom are immigrants or their children, most from Asia or Latin America. I've wondered about the relevance, therefore, of a Nigerian story set a century ago, written in a rather formal, faintly Britishised English prose, which for most of the story takes a leisurely, rather episodic pace until sudden eruptions of energy--as in the night pursuing the priestess, or the fate of the foster son of the protagonist (no plot spoilers here).<br /><br />The final third of the narrative, with the arrival of the missionaries--white and black, it is to be noted--starts to compress the action into a quicker, more Westernised pace, whereas the previous native sections were told in the mode of storytelling reflecting not only the author's exposure to and transformation of the English he learned at 8 and studied at university in the 1950s, to play off against the clash with the newer rush of culture and ideas and force brought by Europeanisation.<br /><br />Fair play to Achebe for a balanced look at the pros and cons and the inevitability of imperialism as it sought out and conquered the traditional holdouts and wiped out or at least gravely injured ancient beliefs and practices. This novel, I believe, works more as a case study from the p-o-v of those forced to submit to the foreign ruler, but Achebe does show that Christianity offers the lowest castes a chance at redemption in this life that they could not have found within the prejudices of the native ideology. This fair-mindedness does much to create a provocative, more nuanced perspective, even as from the indirect consciousness of the protagonist, the new arrivals represent accurately the doom of the power and the order once sustained for so long, isolated from the invader's machinations.<br /><br />As a novel, and not a source of understanding this conflict, I think that Achebe gives a literary work less symbolic and multi-layered than, say, Conrad's Heart of Darkness--which I've taught to students who found it nearly beyond their grasp. That Achebe's book is taught to younger readers surprises me (my copy was in the young adult section of the library), since--like Hemingway--a rather transparent prose style may cover lots of complexity between the lines. However, Achebe's style is plainer, and often in the early stages of the work, there is not the depth below what for non-Nigerian readers holds lots to grasp in terms of a different vocabulary, mentality, and folklore. This is not an easy read, but this is due more to our unfamiliarity with the context than the story itself. The clash of mentalities will be able to be understood by my students, but the intricacies of Achebe's native culture will still be beyond our knowledge from what the glossary provides.

That Achebe's book is taught to younger readers surprises me (my copy was in the young adult section of the library), since--like Hemingway--a rather transparent prose style may cover lots of complexity between the lines. However, Achebe's style is plainer, and often in the early stages of the work, there is not the depth below what for non-Nigerian readers holds lots to grasp in terms of a different vocabulary, mentality, and folklore. This is not an easy read, but this is due more to our unfamiliarity with the context than the story itself. The clash of mentalities will be able to be understood by my students, but the intricacies of Achebe's native culture will still be beyond our knowledge from what the glossary provides.

I have my arguments about some of his stubborn persistence in removing God from Beckett to leave that Sartrian \\"god-shaped hole,\\" but after all, Beckett is notoriously and delightfully difficult to pin down and resists easy categorisation about the presence or absence of the deity in his fictions and dramas and other unclassifiable prose. Calder's exegesis gains added conviction from the closeness between author and publisher for so long.<br /><br />Calder raises an intriguing point: Joyce and Kafka were one-trick, if very talented, ponies next to the variety of genres assayed by SB. Calder delves into what J & K lacked (in his opinion) next to their modernist (and post-modernist, given his lifespan and continuing productions) successor: in Beckett, in his life as in his literature, we find a stoic, compassionate, and above all forgiving mentor. Like sincere religious gurus in the past, his message conveys a detachment from greed, solipsism, fanaticism in the pursuit of a cause or a creed, and care for creatures and the defenseless among us. Remember his early story, with Dante's lobster? Personally, I'd reinforce SB's own charity and thoughtfulness, expressed often without fanfare, and how he humbly practiced what he printed. Calder was moved by the author's morality, too, and he writes this study to promote an understanding of SB less for the literati than for the thinkers, and doers, who need guidance in a world in which faith cannot be thrown away to abstractions rather than channeled into action, responses to assuage real human agony now.<br /><br />Calder explores philosophical, ethical, and religious sources for Beckett's early writings, and compares his own musings to those of Beckett on these matters. The resulting conversation of sorts between SB and Calder invites us to consider our own responses to human suffering, as limned in Beckett's creations and as influencing Calder himself as he became friends with SB.<br /><br />While I disagree with some of Calder's readings, I fully support his aims, and stress that this is an excellent study that deserves an audience and incites a reader to return to Beckett for direction as well as out into the world to act as SB would. If this sounds like Calder makes SB a guru, so be it. For many otherwise in danger of meeting the tautological fate of many of SB's tormented characters, we can learn to read Beckett as a direction out of our own self-imprisonent towards selflessness.<br /><br />I've read a shelf-load of Beckettiana, and I admit that this book, overlooked and not easily found, remains among the two or three to turn to after or during encounters with the primary texts. Not recommended as an introduction or primer (if you're starting from scratch, try Hugh Kenner's Student's Guide to SB); you must get your own bearings and learn to respond on your own terms to SB first. But, for a boost and a reminder of the challenges within--and I might add against reductive--existentialism, Calder gives us a heartfelt, eloquent, and accessible study of a man he knew well and, like many of us, loved for his inspiring humanism.eations and as influencing Calder himself as he became friends with SB.<br /><br />While I disagree with some of Calder's readings, I fully support his aims, and stress that this is an excellent study that deserves an audience and incites a reader to return to Beckett for direction as well as out into the world to act as SB would.

Strong provides for English-speaking readers a better overview of the origins of its leader, Abimael Guzm&aacute;n, and a context within to place the SP among Andean and Peruvian influences. Gorriti writes for a Peruvian audience and assumes they're familiar with his exploration of internecine government, military, and police struggles against each other and the senderistas. Gorriti hits harder against the Leninist and Stalinist inspiration for Guzm&aacute;n's deviations into devolved Maoism and then \\"Gonzalo thought.\\" Strong downplays the brutality of groupthink and brainwashing within the SP but offers a non-sensationalistic representation of their campaign.<br /><br />The energy of certain chapters in Gorriti about SP punishment of dissenters, the raid by police on Ayacucho's prison, and the fevered rhetoric of Guzm&aacute;n's millenarian apocalyptic visions will not be found in Strong. Instead, in muted journalistic fashion, he progresses through the founding of SP, its Incan and Andean mythmaking--a chapter differing than Gorriti, who stresses its political philosophy via its leader's European intellectual influences--its Chinese and Maoist connections, the cocaine trade and the Reagan-Bush early 90s attempts to counter it and gain Peruvian clout against the guerrillas in return for greater US control over the war on drugs and the Peru's regime--the resulting terror as government and guerrilas caught millions in the middle, the role of Catholic, Mormon, and evangelical churches, the cholera epidemic and Fujimori's takeover, and, an area nowhere else that I have read in English covered, the role of the SP within the RCP and the International Maoist and radical movements in the early 1990s. A final glimpse into the first \\"liberated zone\\" of Lima in the shantytown of Raucana shows that, surprisingly, in a downplayed SP scenario, their hope of a red utopia--at least for a time--might actually thrive.<br /><br />I found four areas weakening the whole. Lack of footnotes and often even a mention of his published sources (although a helpful bibliography appears) diminishes greatly the use of this text for further research on specific points the author raises. For instance, Strong relies upon what are probably linguistic coincidences between Chinese and Quechua terms as he labors to make connections between the two realms and the resultant Asian strain in Peruvian native culture and therefore its manipulation by the SP into its deviant Maoism. He also, in my opinion, credits too much Andean roots for the SP, when in fact much of their ideology emerged from Guzm&aacute;n's Kantian and Marxian studies, only later grafting on bits of Incan \\"tradition\\" to lure indigenistas into their often middle- and upper-middle class-led ranks. He wanders off the SP into European racism in the final chapter, when a tighter focus upon the role of the Peruvian diaspora in supporting (or not?) SP needed greater attention. His vignette of \\"The Musical Guerrilla Army\\" debuting for a Sun-Peru SP front, singing in Spanish \\"the people's blood has a beautiful aroma\\" while renting out a Richmond (London) tapas bar for the night serves as a cautionary tale for all lovers of revolution who never suffer themselves the sacrifice.rive. <br /> <br />I found four areas weakening the whole.

But, if you have a basic knowledge of Peru already, this over 500-page collection of stories, chapters from academic books, poems, folktales, political reportage, popular journalism and interviews, and historical and anthropological coverage satisfies the need in English for a comprehensive starter for further research and reading on many topics.<br /><br />Organised into chronological order, sections progress from pre-Inca, Inca, Conquest, Post-Conquest, Colonial and Republican periods into the 19c. These intersperse scholarly investigations with narratives. Then, politics, the Shining Path, the drug wars, the urban squatters turning land into new communities, activists among the feminist, evangelical, and gay communities, liberation theology and local leadership, and life among both villages and in Lima add chapters that comprise about half of the total text.<br /><br />Most rewarding for me were the chronicles by the Incas after the Conquest, John Hemming's chapter on Atahualpa and Pizarro, folktales bookending the text from early and Amazon peoples, Steve J. Stern's analysis of post-Conquest creolisation and its discontents, Manuel Cordova's tale of life a century ago after he was abducted by Amazon indians, and the fascinating account by Catherine J. Allen from her The Hold Life Has all about coca-leaf ritual bonding. Anyone who associates coca only with cola or crack might learn a lot from this anthropological description of how chemicals sustain fellowship, and also force gatherings to acknowledge etiquette and social class distinctions--even under the influence!<br /><br />The literary offerings, poems, novel excerpts, and stories, are less intriguing, but worthwhile. I sense some of these--as with the Vargas Llosa chapter from his novel Conversations in the Cathedral--were a bit wrenched out of a more rewarding context.<br /><br />I wish the past ten years, the downfall of Fujimori and the attempt by Toledo to stabilise a tottering state, could have been included in an updated edition, which could also look at the fate of Guzm&aacute;n and his Shining Path cohorts. Life in the diaspora--a million Peruvians live abroad--would also be enlightening. But, until these hypothetical additions, this is a promising book for anyone curious about Per&uacute;. As the back jacket asserts, there's nothing like this in English--or Spanish.<br /><br />Also recommended: Robin Kirk's The Monkey's Paw for 1980s/early 90s Peru; Gustavo Gorriti's history, translated by Kirk, on the Shining Path, and Vargas Llosa's memoir of running for president, Fish Out of Water; his novelisation of Guzman, The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta; his mystery novel also set in this period, Death in the Andes.o to stabilise a tottering state, could have been included in an updated edition, which could also look at the fate of Guzmn and his Shining Path cohorts.

Peru's Shining Path fanatical cult, devolved from earnest Maoism into indoctrinated millenarian warriors determined to bring down their corrupt nation and destroy it in order to rebuild it into a utopia, chose this weed as their logo.<br /><br />Robin Kirk, in her collection of rather disparate chapters, charts her Peruvian encounters with the senderistas, their pursuers, and the victims left by both sides--'internal refugees' forced off their land by those who claimed to fight for and protect them, whether government or guerrillas. Beginning with her 1983 first visit to Orin Starn as he was writing his dissertation about a Piura hamlet, Tunnel Six, that grew around the spew from an irrigation works near the Ecuadorian border, she records various stints spent in the country over the next decade and more, as the war with Abimael Guzm&aacute;n's disciples intensified and spread to the cities.<br /><br />I read her account after having studied her translation of Gustavo Gorriti's history of the SP. I wondered, from an English-language vantage point, why so few reporters from outside Per&uacute; had produced book-length works for a popular audience on the movement. Why? In large part, the hostility towards 'Western' gringo observers, not only by the army and police suspicious of collaborators, but from the SP itself.<br /><br />Kirk, like previous chroniclers to a land of harsh weapons and forbidding walls, finds herself trapped. Her white skin, San Franciscan provenance, and education distance her from her subjects. They mistrust her, and she finds herself caught between pity and contempt more than once as she listens to guerrilla prisoners. Powerful moments emerge here, but overall, the book feels like a cobbling of previous notes and journalistic material upon which she presumably sent back while in Peru. The section on one family's search for the fate of their son bogs down the pace considerably. The accounts of her quest to find female SPers to talk to reappear throughout, but in a rather scattershot pattern, as does her Lima scenario. I was never sure where I'd find her or when, as about fifteen years appear to have been spanned and compressed here, somewhat confusingly.<br /><br />However, Kirk's honesty, her own realisation that she can only approach but never enter the interior of those she interviews, makes for a bracing if disheartening recounting of her Peruvian journeys.<br /><br />A sample quote: \\"{W}hen the column came, people hid. But the column could drag them from their homes and administer a 'popular trial.' The column could shoot them or hack them to death with machetes or stone them as they begged for mercy. Or the column could force a daughter to kill a father; a husband his wife. La columna could force an entire village to march before them, forming the people's vanguard of an attack. It burnt the houses of those it deemed traitors. It took those, especially the young, it found useful. The column called itself 'the people's wrath.' Its appearances could be as sudden as a thunderhead cresting a ridge. Its departures were scored by the slow, measured sound of grief.\\" (104)<br /><br />Its name taken from a poem (by Jos&eacute; Carlos Mar&iacute;ategui, founder of Per&uacute;'s CP in the 1920s), its nightmarish rhetoric, its idealised portraits transforming its portly Ayacucho doctor into a cherubic, trimmer messiah of redemption through decimation: all underscore the actual distance between the SP and those from the lowly for whom it mediated in fevered litany its 'pensimiento Gonzalo'.  As an aid worker asks Kirk: 'if they are fighting for the people, why kill them? Why did they drive them away?' (170) This discussion leads into an excellent analysis of what differentiates senderistas from other militants.<br /><br />Kirk, by the end, finds that she cannot keep returning to the flame that threatens to devour her. As a journalist, she finds that her employers less eagerly solicit stories on community reform than terrorist assaults. As the SP reels from the backlash by not only the government forces but vigilante peasant groups, these same gatherings find that they may have learned a bit from the mystical nihilism of the senderos after all. Not in content so much as in form. For what were once dreams begin to assume reality. In the wake of first Velasco's land reform and then the SP, despite the near-collapse of the economy and its mismanagement by whoever manipulates himself into the presidency, the common people begin to embrace local control of their justice system, their farm production, and their faith, which increasingly finds its dynamism fueled by evangelical Protestantism and its insistence upon self-worth and hard work to achieve security. As Kirk wings her way from Per&uacute; for the final flight home, she admits her bravery and its lack. In the awe-inspiring but also awful--in its sheer reach beyond human power--array of climates and terrains, Per&uacute; represents a microcosm of our planet's diversity--and our inability to grasp our place in the macrocosm. She learns the lesson: 'Never underestimate fear.'

Reading this in tandem with John Ryan's \\"Remembering How We Stood,\\" it's instructive to find how much the two memoirs of bohemian, post-war Dublin overlap yet each keeps its own particular focus separate even as they cover so many similar events: Behan's self-promotion, Kavanagh's libel litigation, and Flann O'Brien's insular inspiration. The Scots painters \\"The Roberts\\" receive greater detail here than in Ryan, as he knows them in London and follows their troubled relationship further. Likewise, Cronin provides a pre-fame Behan in all his exasperating energy as the two bum about France. Ryan keeps his attention on the Dublin setting from which he witnessed the literati's coming and going; Cronin brings in the Continent and Britain to widen the perspective, often offering greater detail if no less a careful analysis than Ryan. As a fellow writer, Cronin--unlike the publican/editor of Envoy Ryan--was seen by Kavanagh especially as competition, and this intensity adds dynamism to Cronin's descriptions of his conniving compatriots.<br /><br />Certainly there is humor, but more profoundly, melancholy. Drink, sexual repression and expression, and the limitations of what Ireland could offer talented writers in this repressed era makes for cautionary tales about how short-lived fame can be and how crippling it can be for those whose lives outlast their genius. Cronin's briefer, later encounters with his subjects after they have fallen from the heights gain poignancy even as he refuses to sentimentalise his (former) friends, since they too often all too easily refuse to take blame for their own fate.<br /><br />When I read about Julian Mclaren-Ross, I figured this minor figure was popular in the Edwardian period; when Cronin reveals that this once-recognised author was then--deep in decline--only in his forties, it only underscored the brevity of renown and the long slide afterwards so many must endure from the creative ranks. Cronin writes precisely, without cliche, self-pity, or cruelty. Along with Ryan, Cronin's non-autobiographical (!) memoir marks a celebration and an epitaph for 1945-55, more or less, among a coterie who sabotaged their own potential--even as they tried to achieve more than their society dared allow for them.<br /><br />(Cronin's fictionalisation, Life of Riley, on this period is also worth reading, as are his incisive biographies of Flann O'Brien and--a figure curiously absent from Dead as Doornails even in an aside--Samuel Beckett.)ep in decline--only in his forties, it only underscored the brevity of renown and the long slide afterwards so many must endure from the creative ranks.

His memoirs won't tell you much about himself, but lots about the milieu from which Donleavy's \\"The Ginger Man\\" attained notoriety in decades past.<br /><br />Paddy Kavanagh comes off as especially waspish here; Flann O'Brien as clever as you'd expect; Brendan Behan's responsible for some hilarious anecdotes--the cats and the steak my favorite--and also irritation and disgust, as we see through Ryan's eyes how playing up to his reputation brought him low. \\"Pope\\" O'Mahony, a lesser-known character but equally deserving of fame, exasperates as an erudite, gnomic leg-puller. The only one whose aura seems too dim here--as Ryan admits, at least on paper--is the Ginger Man's inspiration, the enigmatic Gainor Crist.<br /><br />I expected more about the infamous \\"catacombs\\" about which Behan's recent biographer, Michael O'Sullivan, wrote, and about McDaids, but one understands the lack, given that Ryan ran his own pub! His take at the whole drinking and intellectual climate of 1945-55, considered the doldrums of Irish creative life, remains both serious and sardonic, muted and moving, in an inimitable prose open to irony, insight, and inspiration, but never cruelty, one-upsmanship, or false sentimentality.<br /><br />(Also recommended: fellow Bloomsday trekker Anthony Cronin.

Nicholas Grene's analysis compares about 20 plays through topics relating to political concerns and stage representations of Irishness; Anthony Roche's survey of 1950-90 begins by focusing on Beckett's impact and then extends to a few of the major playwrights, stressing their departure from one lead and a strong plot into more open-ended structures and mostly a double-male lead set-up. Prof. Murray examines a broader range of playwrights while necessarily diminishing the space he devotes to any one playwright or play.<br /><br />His thesis for Irish drama: 'the mirror does not give back the real; it gives back images of a perceived reality. The play as mirror up to nation, rather than to nature in Hamlet's sense, results in a dynamic in process: you have to stop it in freeze-frame to distinguish what happened (history) from what might yet happen (poltics).' (9) Yeats, Lady Gregory, Synge, O'Casey (on whom Murray has written a biography from Dublin's Gill & Macmillan, 2004) receive chapters, but attention to lesser-studied writers such as Paul Vincent Carroll, Denis Johnston, Behan, and George Sheils gives Murray's survey added detail. He examines drama on and from the North, and adds newer dramatists such as Sebastian Barry, Marina Carr, Dermot Bolger to older contributors like John Leonard, Friel, Murphy, and Stewart Parker. Although I wish he had given more time to the curious M.J. Molloy, his comments on Carr I found particularly astute.<br /><br />Murray paces himself incisively and sharply. Of the Abbey's Ernest Blythe's determination to produce Irish-language plays ub the 40's & 50s: \\"Laudable as this cultural aim may have been, its effect was to distract from the dramatic responsibility of confronting audiences with the art which questions assumptions and reveals the gods by which people live.\\" (142) He uncovers tidbits like Tom Murphy's recruitment to join a lay committee to assist the Vatican in crafting a vernacular liturgy better suited to contemporary needs. Drama in Ireland, Murray emphasizes, 'oscillates always between tradition and innovation. It never occupies either pole for long, but invariably registers the tension. Irish drama is a long, energetic dispute with a changing audience over the same basic issues: where we come from, where we are now, and where we are headed. Alternatively, these questions comprise history, identity, home or a sense of place, and visionary imagination or what Shaw above called dreaming, or myth-making.\\" (224)<br /><br />In closing, this book shows the results of decades of thought, classroom experience, and scholarship. He ends with reflections on the \\"national dream-life\\". I will quote his final paragraph.<br /><br />'This national need to rephrase, however obliquely or symbolically, this Beckett-like obligation to express, is not just a mark of the garrulous Irish swopping yarns in the pub or within earshot of earnest American scholars. It persists as a mode of being. It is the material of performance, of enacting assurances that we are alive and can survive in spite of our unshakeable memory of defeat. For Yeats [. . .], \\"It was the dream itself that enchanted me\\", and so it has always been. The dream is always waiting to be fulfilled; the nation is always awaiting completion. It has been the assumption of this book that mirror and dream are two sides of the same mimetic process. Irish drama both records cultural conditions and generates fresh possibilities.

His juxtapositions work energetically to open up new perspectives on Beckett--no small feat given the weight of scholarship that confronts the novice to his drama. By playing off Godot against Behan's Quare Fellow, we see that Roche's thesis--of the recent Irish drama less concerned with conventional plot than an entry into the void, what waits outside the wings of the stage--gains force.<br /><br />His chapters on Tom Murphy, Friel, Tom Kilroy, and plays about \\"The Troubles\\" continue this exploration into less comforting, confrontational plays exploding (at best) stereotypical limitations of Ireland and its representation. Roche avoids jargon, constructs his points carefully and cleverly, and brings to us welcome insights and a refusal to fall into cliche as he winnows down forty-odd years of plays to concentrate on the writers best suited to challenge us today.<br /><br />At one point he reflects how lucky he was to see a particular play in many performances, and how he sat \\"rapt.\\" Such enthusiasm, tempered with a wide knowledge of contexts within which internationally and locally to place the drama he studies, add to the appeal and the energy found in this volume.	2004-12-08

Expecting an overview of how different languages have been spoken, recorded, and continued in Ireland, I found a collection of talks given to the Irish translators & interpreters' association. While, as the table of contents shows, you do find comprehensive studies of Irish, early-medieval Latin, German, Ulster-Scots, medieval French, \\"language interface\\" in early Irish culture, you also get sign language, renderings of Sophocles, modern translations of French poetry, and essays on space within a globalised context and memetics & metatranslation.<br /><br />The range, therefore, while wide, fails to satisfy those who need greater depth on a particular topic. For instance, Liam Mac Coil's presentation of the state of Irish (Gaelic) today fits it into wider debates about language death, and continuity. These concerns, while valuable, have appeared in other fora, and veer away, given the idiosyncratic nature of his digressions that follow, from a comprehensive mapping of the health of Irish today. The talk was undoubtably entertaining and impressive, but its rendering on paper leaves the energy rather limp and loose.<br /><br />Still, this volume can serve as a springboard into other scholarship on many of the topics, and might be useful for those needing a quick, if sometimes too limited, glance at the general status of linguistic differences in past and present Ireland.<br /><br />(By the way, for Irish, see also James McCloskey's Voices Silenced? and Ciaran MacMurchaidh's Who Needs Irish for more debate on points shared with MacCoil in the above volume. Co-editor Michael Cronin's Translating Ireland from Cork UP, 1996, is well worth reading for its fascinating reflections.)	2004-12-08

The sheer timespan of that last clause, from our 21st century perspective, shows how durable has been the legacy of a language-group that we don't even know the true name for-only that many of us descend from varied ethnicities who shared related systems of communication, dating back thousands of years. Even the name Celt is a Greek invention. Defining the Celtic, then, depends upon its clash with the foreigner; so much that Cornwall and Wales owe their names to what the Saxons called the `Other', those outside the common-wealth, those un-familiar, those pushed back to, as a Cornish author lamented over two hundred years ago, `about the cliff and the sea'.<br /><br />Notice that Tanner, in looking for the remnants of those who speak or revive Celtic languages, differentiates speech from the material culture of the six nations he explores. He visits the Scots Isles, Conamara, West Belfast, the Isle of Man, North and South Wales, Brittany, and finally the outlying colonies in Canada's Maritimes and Argentina's Patagonia. While he finds music, say in Cape Breton, vibrant, there Scots Gaelic, despite the murmur of tourist brochures, will be far less heard-spoken by at most 500 people. Brittany and Galway certainly cater to cultural tourism, and hawk their Keltic Krafts diligently, but in these more ancient redoubts, too, Tanner finds growing indifference to the language's perpetuation. Over and over, he notes, outsiders-those who have taken as adults to learning Celtic languages-find themselves resented, marginalised, or dismissed by natives embarrassed to speak to strangers, ashamed of their own lack of fluency, or determined to let their language die a quiet death in their homes rather than in public.<br /><br />The conclusions he raises will depress those for whom cultural revivals portend linguistic renaissance. The strongest part of the book, in fact, is its introduction. Tanner notes how, since the entry of clerical control from Rome in early mediaeval times, revivals have occurred! Monks eager to draw a lineage rooted in native genealogies manufactured branches for those grafting papal foliage onto arguably indigenous Catholic varietals.<br /><br />Anglo-Saxon and Norman invaders invented Celtic origins for their dynasties and legends; Reformers and Romanticists followed after Catholicism had succumbed to first Protestants and then the cult of nature-these in turn sought antiquarian justification for their authority. Finally, the New Age/Wicca/ecological movements have manufactured a spuriously feminist, magickal, and pacifist kingdom in which an alienated urban, affluent, Western European consumer can recapture a realm of vegan, polysexual, pagan lifestyles.<br /><br />But we already know what to expect. His preface concludes rueing the label given the Celts by so many for so long: dreamers denied political victory, quaint and charming, content to live as Tolkienesque `eternal elves of the West'. He does not mention that even the elves left at the end of the 3rd age.<br /><br />And it seems that the Celts too are departing, and their ancient tongues, upon which the linguist JRR Tolkien in part had invented his own array of fictional but linguistically correct tongues, will be as removed from our future reality as those of Middle-Earth's. People may learn Breton as they do Elvish or Esperanto, but as a community language, Tanner predicts, it will be as dead as Manx or the three debated re-versions of Cornish.<br /><br />He ends his forward with a poignant panorama. The Celtic sea ebbs, first into pools, now into puddles. Where can we immerse when these last splashes dessicate and evaporate?<br /><br />For, as Tanner's scholarship (if too often rather undigested; names-dates-clerical minutiae diminishes the pace of much of this book--down one star) demonstrates, no continuous territory remains over which a Celtic language is spoken. We see this in the broken Gaeltachta&iacute;, the loss of Welsh and Scots regional cohesion, the disappearance of any Breton-speaking heartland, and the nearly extinct numbers of speakers of Welsh in Patagonia and Gaelic in Canada. On the other hand, many whom Tanner interviews simply shrug that this demonstrates a Darwinian natural selection. The fittest languages remain, English, French, or Spanish in these cases. Why, after all, keep a minority language as a curiousity when no monoglots still exist in any Celtic tongue? What's the value, economically, educationally, emotionally, of holding on to an unwieldy, unremunerative, and unattractive heirloom?<br /><br />(P.S. For guardedly more optimistic views on the future of Irish, see James McCloskey's Voices Silenced and Ciaran MacMurcaidh's Who Needs Irish?

Since Fuhrman and I are only a year apart in age, I thought this'd be an intriguing read for its take on being thirteen or so, 1974. It was that, but the hasty nature of the ending, the less-than-satisfying, melodramatic climax with the animals, and the underdeveloped comic-book context within which the story starts and finishes (not to mention the misleading cover art) left me with an appreciation for a work in progress.<br /><br />The best sections by far were the episodes with Craig and the later racial protest--here, you felt as if you were surrounded, bike in hand, facing the adult world for the first time in all of its unruly, unstereotyped, and unclear messiness. The night spent with Margie, the scenes of familial dispute, and the boredom of classroom life all gain their own sharp moments, but the characters of his Mama and siblings needed more development. He sets up Mama, for example, in a larger context of friends she shares on the phone and seemingly keeps apart from her husband, linked to a college class she takes, but this and her life outside the home is left scattered. Perhaps this reflects only what the narrator's limited vision is at the time, but this p-o-v itself becomes contradicted by the last pages of the book.<br /><br />Surprisingly, little period detail specifically from 1974 exists here. Characters like the priests and nuns flit in and out but do not stick--I imagine that this was changed in the film. Fuhrman's narrator at best strives for a Holden Caulfield type of wisdom, and he and his cronies possess an admirable range of artistic references, given their dialogue, but the artistic side that represents rebellion and escape, like the novel itself, needed much more work that the author's early death prevented.<br /><br />On the other hand, the film (which I have not seen) inspired my twelve-year-old son to read the novel, and now he's asking me to find him William Blake's \\"The Marriage of Heaven and Hell\\"! From Amazon's links, I see we're not the only readers with this tie-in. So, postmortem congratulations to Fuhrman's example for today's adolescents.

Only to convey that, unlike many other \\"coming-of-age\\" stories of a youth, Arguedas' semi-autobiographical tale presents a boy already formed even before the events of the bulk of the narrative. A pantheism rushes over his pages, and the Catholicism in whose school he is domiciled for most of the story remains more of a veneer over a pagan and defiant Quechua world refusing to succumb under the oppressive colonial and clerical regimes. The set-pieces of the book, the uprising of the peasant women for salt and waiting in the town as the plague approaches, gain force when (as Vargas Llosa notes in his afterword) placed within a calmer flow of words, at times scraped by harsh reality.<br /><br />The descriptions of the natural world remain moving; however, many of the supporting characters at the youth's boarding school and the girl he courts (from afar it seems more than close up) stay rather diffused and vague. Nearly no details emerge, for example, of the actual schooling he receives, but plenty of cringeworthy accounts of how Rector Linares attempts to manipulate the Gospels to placate insurrectionists. A message, I gather, that subsequent generations in Latin America learned from. The prescience of this work, given the later events in Per&uacute;, makes Arguedas all the more compelling a contribution, that even in English (thanks to the abundant Quechua blended in), makes for a bracingly vivid read, with hints of what would become \\"magic realism\\" mixed with muted political critique and personal quests for identity for a boy caught between cultures.	2004-12-05

The English with property who resented the burden to their town's coffers, the threat imposed by vagabonds on the highways, and the ideological dissension against the Commonwealth rallied under leaders promising-under the sign of the laurel branch-to restore the true Faith and retain those strong enough to lock up, exile, or condemn those who sought to undermine their kingdom. `Inspired by Scripture, with a burning vision of a just, godly, disciplined community, they determined to uphold the law, reform the manners and habits of the poor, protect true religion, and maintain orthodoxy in word and deed. They were often sincere, energetic, and compassionate; they were also intolerant and merciless (their principles demanded no less).' (2) Seeking unanimity and no protest, they dedicated themselves to a better land, one that would please their Creator by enforcing an end to humanity's baser actions and instincts. Bennett implies that such a tale might not seem out of place today. Imams and preachers might agree.<br /><br />Fairly, the author, aided by his own considerable familiarity with legal theories and the everyday practices of the early 17th c., strives to be fair to both sides in this clash of ideologies. John Brigge himself comes from the recusants, those few who persisted in Catholicism and who argues for mercy against those who triumph in their wish to render harsh justice.<br /><br />Bennett eschews stereotypes, at least in his narrative's start.  In prose crafted painstakingly to convey the thoughts and speech of educated as well as ignorant folks of the 1630s, Bennett carefully shows, in a novel entirely from Brigge's indirectly expressed consciousness, how visions, dreams, portents, and prayers mixed with half-understood remedies, medical hearsay, and folkloric incantations to construct the mind of a sophisticated early 17 c. Englishman. His use of colloquial dialogue, monologue, and period details portrays a land not unfamiliar to inhabitants of such climes today, but one before the Enlightenment, before scientific breakthroughs, and one still trusting in revelations as much as reason. The picture seen through Brigge's eyes, painted by Bennett, remains far more reliant upon fevered reveries as much as ratiocination, and this results in an uneven novel. At times, the focus blurs and shifts, as in an art-house movie, away from a determinedly realistic into an impressionistic depiction of a mentality still pre-modern. While the intent is admirable, the changes do deter contemporary 21st c. readers from fully appreciating Bennett's attempt to faithfully match Brigge's mental state. The jarring entry, especially as the novel progresses, of nearly magical realism (to use the Latin American fictional equivalent) draws too much attention to the art utilised by Bennett at the risk of too much concentration on the illusionary state suffered by Brigge, upon whom we as readers remain dependent for the entire story.<br /><br />This shortcoming aside, Bennett exposes a Brueghelian tableau of hideous faces, strange diets, and half-fanciful caricatures as he brings into his novel a mixture of a murder mystery that Brigge must solve, a family drama as he must wrestle with the aftermath of infidelity while caring for his new son, and his own manipulation by the city officials who seek either his allegiance or his ouster. The plot carries you forward, past the genre formulae of a whodunit, into the tension between two visions of how people are to be governed. Implicitly, Brigge's Catholic tendency to forgive stands a losing battle against the Puritan emphasis upon punishment against the sinner. Brigge, fearing that he cannot resist the majority, wakes one night: `He tried to pray, but he could not make himself unafraid. This is man's true state, he thought, to know fear. This is what being human means, above all else. We are bundles of fear and need. The rest is a mere distraction, a way to deceive ourselves out of our terrors, which we sometimes hide and which we sometimes forget, but we remain afraid. We are all afraid.' Insensibly, Bennett's existential modern view merges with that of his 1630s character, steeped in Catholic verities yet terrified by the void.<br /><br />The novel loses pace after a deus ex machina allows Brigge to wander out on the roads with a band of half-crazed pilgrims advocating evangelical purity; Bennett seems to be setting up a sequel to his novel before he finishes Brigge's own tale. Its diffusion into almost magical realism casts more of a miasmatic haze over the denouement, and diminishes the power of the earlier chapters. This shortcoming aside, the novel still remains worth reading for its prose, its acuity, and its topic.<br /><br />(Adapted from \\"Puritan Death Ethic,\\" on-line review at the website for The Blanket)self unafraid.

That is, playwrights strive to show an Ireland truer to reality than that previously shown by stereotypical \\"stage Irish\\" caricatures or plots. Thus, Grene argues, his selection of plays attempt to realistically capture Irish life for audiences expected to be familiar with both its distorted enactments and the more accurately dramatized Ireland that replaces it, generation after generation, in the corrective plays that supersede the earlier inaccuracies.<br /><br />This daunting thesis Grene illustrates by a variety of plays, familiar as Synge's Playboy and unfamiliar (at least to me) as Tom Murphy's A Crucial Week. Most exciting for me are his discoveries within the historical distortions placed into Translations by Brian Friel, the autobiographical elisions applied by Sean O'Casey, the Tuam, Co Galway work of Murphy, the making of Behan's The Hostage vs. its Irish-language precedent, and the possibilities for a change from the usual Irish themes in Yeats' Purgatory and Beckett's All That Fall.<br /><br />Grene avoids pedantry, trendy critical jargon, and keeps the reader in mind as he studies such works honestly. He credits other scholars thoughtfully, brings in the historical and political contexts but never allows them to overshadow the actual plays, and summarizes earlier debates about them well.<br /><br />One shortcoming: as if sensing that students might be using his book as a crib to avoid reading the plays, he does shy away more than once from examining their endings. While he exerts much effort in establishing the background and conflicts emerging from many play's earlier plots, he tends to duck out before bringing some of his close readings to a dramatic close.	2004-11-29

In smaller sections, it captivates you with a sense of what it was like, in 1968, just before this then-isolated island got an airport and electric hookups to the global village, to spend a wet and windy winter on the edge of the Atlantic. But, as a whole, the authorial smugness and arch prose drag down a book in which nearly nothing happens. Not that this itself is a downfall, for in parts you realize what it'd be like to face yourself, as a young person shy, awkward, and introspective, who has taken yourself out of urban life nearly entirely for long stints. The pleasure of this account, in fact, is in its lack of the picturesque, the quaint, or the predictable travelogue produced by so many Irish visitors, short or long-term. The writer's failure to come to terms with even a fair try at the Irish language prevents him from appreciating more than a superficial understanding into a very crucial element of the Aran mentality. This transience distances him from his place. Certainly, this short book lacks the overwhelming erudition of Tim Robinson's hefty and valuable academic investigations of the island, but its lightweight quality itself's too ephemeral. (By the way, consulting Robinson's island map and comparing it to McNeillie's whereabouts, he seems to have boggled his true location, perhaps to protect the identity of his host family.)<br /><br />It reminds me of another outsider who came to stay for a time in the West of Ireland, Lawrence Millman's They'll Never See Our Like Again, which also added little but likewise floundered when the writer tried to assume a bit too hubristic attitude when it came to one who thinks he knows better than the daytrippers once he's mistaken by them for a native. Not everyone who well-intentedly visits a foreign place can afford to live there for a year, and such condescension diminishes the authority of those who stay longer but still (as McNeillie to his credit admits) will never really \\"go native\\" at least in the eyes of the real inhabitants. Very few of Inis M&oacute;r's  natives seem to establish any rapport with McNeillie. This ironically draws for me a truer picture than many tourists hoodwinked by pub chatter and conniving characters into thinking they've gained some profound insight into Ireland.<br /><br />So, while his intent can be admired, this product nevertheless fails to live up to its intent. Far too often the pages float by with little ballast. He writes well about nature, but this could have been an essay, since it has no reason to be so drawn out for so little substance. If McNeillie wrote it to warn off his children against their father's example, it's not apparent here what harm this mundane sojourn one winter had on the author. He spends time in a drafty cabin, gets seasick, gets really sick, fishes, helps with farm chores, daydreams, drinks, and keeps a diary. Eventually he has to go back home come summer.

Much of the material has been prepared for those needing a warm-up to 16 June 2004. Now that's passed, however, there's much to help the Joycean newcomer to Ulysses. It diminishes the Linati schemata that has caused many to rely too heavily on Homeric parallels. It frees readers by showing that whatever their fears, other actors, critics, and readers have shared them. While I wish it would have offered more of a chapter-by-chapter run down just to set the scene for first-timers, and while it pads the book too much with appendices at the expense of tips needed by novices, it does meet a need for the 'amateur' who seeks out Joyce for enjoyment rather than fulfilling a course assignment--a sure way to deaden many an enticing narrative.<br /><br />The book offers little of the larger context of Joyce's other literary efforts within which to place Ulysses, but given the compression of even an overview and a few points-of-view within 160 pp., Nora Tully earns praise.<br /><br />A shame her name comes third after the ubiquitous Frank McCourt (who I admit has a couple of decent insights nonetheless from his brief forward) and Isaiah Sheffer, who muses at length about the NYC Symphony Spaced readings each B-day. These personal encounters with the text, then, prepare for Tully's own skillfully arranged array of comments, mainly from past literati (for copyright reasons?) about the novel. Interspersed are mini-essays, the best of which were Mary Gordon's account of how she teaches the Nausicaa episode (you always find something new when returning to a familiar text: for me, she showed me the benediction-monstrance-Gerty's crotch link in a way I hadn't noticed before!); Tennessee Williams' term paper; a Vanity Fair ranking of thinkers by critics in the early 20c; and Robert Spoo's veiled attack, justifiably deserving to be even less muted, on the copyright abuses by the estate keeping Joyce from entering at last the public domain in Britain and Ireland.<br /><br />A handy map of Dublin; updates on Joyce websites; recommended books and videos; celebrations of B-Day worldwide; cinematic, fictional, dramatic, and musical tributes: these round out a satisfying collection. I wish a review of the various audio versions appeared, for as this book says, listening to Joyce read well adds the musicality and the aurality that the author, myopic as he was, depended upon to convey meaning from an admittedly daunting pile of print.

Farrell	Books	4	8	8	N	N	A carefully written life, but not lit crit	Among leftist writers once lionised in America, James T. Farrell suffered (along with his slightly older counterpart John Dos Passos) one of the most precipitous declines. Imagine: having published his Studs Lonigan trilogy before the age of 30, he was not even 50 when he was assumed dead-at least on a plaque put up to honour past literati who had resided at New York's bohemian accommodation, The Hotel Chelsea. When I read his trilogy, considered the quintessential Irish American expression in print, it had just been reissued along with a 1979 TV version. I never saw the adaptation, but the evocation of documentary detail combined with sociological re-creation appealed to me much as some science-fiction has. That is, clumsily but engrossingly told. For Farrell, like authors of other genre fiction, conveyed the force of ideas and scenes rather than the polish of style and craft. The energy of his vocation propelled him past the fifty-book mark by his death, the same year that I read him and that the TV series appeared.<br /><br />Self-absorbed, self-pitying, and self-righteous, these traits kept Farrell a type himself. Robert K. Landers offers a comprehensive biography drawing on not so much Farrell's fiction as his character.<br /><br />Farrell here has received the attention of a conscientious and skeptical biographer, who keeps his distance a bit from both his subject's increasing grandiosity and his opponents' ideological ferocity. The depiction of his marriages, his affairs, and his anti-Stalinist skirmishes all emerge clearly and without melodrama. Landers, in a massive undertaking, only has three typos throughout, a rarity in these days even among serious books. And, by the way, it's amazing how poor a speller the unedited F. was, judging from his own correspondence here.<br /><br />Farrell, asleep under the influence with a lit cigarette, incinerated much of his own archives, so the effort Landers makes to reconstruct the life and times of F. is considerable. Yet, you learn little of his actual work, even of Studs. Many admirers are quoted in these pages, but you wonder what the fuss is about, distant as Landers stands from his best work. Not to mention, on the other hand, lots more of his substandard productions. But, as is clear here, he lived long enough to write more slovenly work than stellar prose, unfortunately.<br /><br />Understandably, some of his later novels gain no more than a single sentence of mention! This approach discourages newcomers from seeking out his lesser-known works, but apparently, Landers implies from the lack of coverage given the vast majority of his published product, they aren't worth the bother.<br /><br />For decades, driven to keep churning out sub-standard contributions in order to support himself and satisfy his compulsion to create, Farrell poured out much of his waking time-aided by amphetamine addiction-into manic bursts of immersion, He could conjure up, as he had in Studs Lonigan's Southside Chicago's Washington Park neighbourhood, a wealth of precisely recalled descriptions, exactly rendered conversations, and characters drawn from life-his life, and his family. This did not endear him to all of his childhood and adolescent chums, not to mention his relatives, who found themselves not caricatured but recorded in his fiction, with only their names changed. But, protecting no innocents.<br /><br />A dropout from the eminent University of Chicago, Farrell's studiously amateur but doggedly pursued course of largely autodidactic education led him early to reject the Church and embrace atheism. But, perhaps like Joyce in his creative vision if not his intellectual rigour, he could never truly leave Rome in favour of more rational or chilly cultural climes. As Joyce limned Dublin, so Farrell Chicago. Despite living in New York City most of his life, his best work emerged from his early encounters on the Southside.<br /><br />And, like a musician playing the oldies circuit, audiences never wanted to hear his new album, his claims that the art he'd just done was his best effort yet. He knew he had made it once, and had to keep that bittersweet realisation for the next forty-five years.<br /><br />But, in his defiance of the easy way out, in his view of function as a method by which the struggles of an Irish American slum family could be demonstrated, and by his forthright adherence to a cause called by many idealistic but by him somehow achievable, Farrell leaves a legacy better found, as Landers shows, in his refusal to put his characters into either revolutionary romanticism or socialist realism. As early as his first and best work, Farrell promised that he would never toe the party line. When writers were expected to kow-tow to how Lenin ordered art to be manufactured, Farrell broke the mold and hand-crafted his own awkward but endearing figures. When artists were threatened to hammer heroic figures out of proleterian clay, Farrell cleared a path for those for whom truth could never surrender to an ideology. For this, Farrell's Studs and Landers' Farrell deserve credit.<br /><br />P.S.

Its relative compression--about 40% less than Grits and with two main characters rather than eight or so. The fact that they both speak the same dialect also helps the pace and depth of this novel. As the millennium strikes popularily in 2000 (if not calendarically), Victor finds himself immediately taken, in more ways than one, by Kelly. We find out first his side of the story, then hers. Details from her narrative fill in gaps left from his perspective, and the result gives what for readers of Griffiths other fiction are again visits to the DSS, gripes about the consumerist lifestyle, and ennui interspersed with not so much chemical but hormonal charges.<br /><br />This shift from hundreds of pages of drug-fueled states of consciousness to a couple of a hundred focused more upon sex does move the plot along more quickly and less sullenly than that of Grits. As with the earlier novel, poignant moments are few but effectively rendered against a harsh, noisy, and brutal city landscape. The two cathedrals of Liverpool tower over the characters symbolically and literally as Kelly and Victor scramble to keep their footing in an increasingly tense relationship with one another and with their surroundings.<br /><br />After reading Sheepshagger, Grits, and Kelly + Victor, I'm still left curious if Griffiths can convey other milieux as effectively as he can that of these often intelligent but determinedly scamming and disenfranchised young. I must admit that given pages of effectively captured but numbingly cumulative monologue and dialogue--with their scrounging and complaining about the injustice of it all--his characters are only too eager to keep living off of the welfare paid them by others caught up in their own mundane, if often less chemically sustained, drab jobs. Certainly his characters find enough income to keep their alcohol and pharmaceutical intake steady.<br /><br />This distance, then, from his often articulate but stubbornly willful layabouts does diminish this reader's sympathy for their plight. Perhaps this is part of Griffith's more subtle message, but I suspect that he considers himself a voice for the voluntarily proleteriat rather than their humanist critic. While I empathize with many of his characters' ideological rants more often than not, their repeated refusal to act upon their raised consciousness makes for a frustrating encounter with so many partially educated but stubbornly lazy sods. I look forward to reading whatever Griffith produces about British youth today, but I also urge that he'd hone his critique a bit more sharply against the multiple causes for anomie today among its drowsy and shifty malingerers.and pharmaceutical intake steady.<br /><br />This distance, then, from his often articulate but stubbornly willful layabouts does diminish this reader's sympathy for their plight.

Clearly, the influence of Graham Greene colors Shakespeare's characters such as the alcoholic priest, the effete bishop, the corrupted policeman, and the \\"palanca\\" prisoner. And, the example of Garcia Marquez' non-magical realism shows in the portrayals of the three old men on the bench who serve as a chorus on the events rather confusingly and slowly spread out in the chronology of a novel that jumps from 1965 to 1983 to 1986 in the main parts and back to the earlier 20c in the backstory, very reminiscent of Latin American storytellers in its family saga of eccentrics and rogues.<br /><br />In parts, the tale comes alive through the author's descriptions and word choices. In other places, it sags--especially in the end--and the tension brought by the real Sendero Luminoso to Peru drains from much of the narrative. By the end, you get the sense that the guerrillas are no more a national threat than the Weather Underground or Patty Hearst's SLA was to the U.S. However, I doubt that this was Shakespeare's intention in his effort to convey the drama of terrorism and those caught up in its convictions.<br /><br />Extra credit for a mention of Jean Gerson, 15th century Catholic theologian, and the curious byways into Mariolatry. This subplot itself does reveal relevant consquences for the titular plot of the novel, although by the end this purportedly central symbol appears diminished and secondary among what has become, despite its rather short length, a too complicated and diffused plot.<br /><br />(At least one figure here returns in his other novel about Peru and the Senderos, The Dancer Upstairs. Comparisons to Mario Vargas Llosa's novel The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta invited.)	2004-11-10

In a 1998 preface, he briefly describes how, when president (elected in 1990) Alberto Fujimori staged a coup in 1992, he was arrested for his investigational journalism into the president and his `Creole Rasputin'-right before the arrest of Comrade Gonzalo. Gorriti managed to escape, files spirited out of the country too, and wound up in Panama working for its paper La Prensa. There, in 1996, he again faced his enemies as that government threatened him after he exposed a campaign financed by a Colombian drug cartel. He lived in his office for weeks, so as to foil police plans for his deportation. He emerged victorious, determined to uphold-in what he calls `cosmetic democracies', a free press.<br /><br />At the time Gorriti compiled his tale of the SL, he had intended it as part of a three-volume work on the Peruvian Communist Party and its many alphabet-soup off-brands. This shows, as I was instantly immersed into a detailed narrative of unions, strikes, police machinations, and bureaucratic-to me-trivia. The book is probably not the first place to go for a quick introduction to the situation into which Sendero Luminoso stumbled. Gorriti clearly addresses an audience more familiar than I was with his country. Still, the gifts of his journalistic verve carried me through pages of departmental decisions into powerful chapters that highlighted the deadly nature of Guzm&aacute;n's millenarian blend of Lenin, Marx, Mao, and messianic apocalypse that plunged-literally-much of his nation into darkness and resulted in at least 70,000 deaths, half of these at the hands of those who claimed to liberate the people from their imperialist oppressors. Half of these at the hands of those who claimed to protect the people from their revolutionary oppressors.<br /><br />This is Gorriti's achievement. Eschewing the glib slogans of the left and the harsh vows of the right, he tracks the rise of the Shining Path from a few students tossing dynamite-a commodity readily nicked from the mines-to police reprisals and the spread of societal breakdown across the Andes and into, as the book ends, the edges of the city. What the history lacks is a context for foreign readers into which Guzm&aacute;n and his ilk can be placed. Not even his birthdate is given; we know nothing here about his early schooling, what kind of a doctor he was, or how Jos&eacute; Carlos Mari&aacute;tegui founded the PCP, apparently in the 1930s. This information, which any academic editor would insist upon in a conventional manuscript, is, I assume, assumed by Gorriti not to matter or to be common knowledge to his Peruvian audience. Robin Kirk (who has written a lefty's view of Per&uacute;, The Monkey's Paw) translates what, given my knowledge of Spanish, I presume carries the uneven rhythms of the original prose, with its leaden `he said, she said' reports from within the corridors of power as well as its nearly cinematic vignettes of attacks and reprisals from the front.<br /><br />Given these drawbacks, nonetheless, the uneasy mixture of dry minutiae about police intelligence sloshes against a potent additive. Excellent analyses of Sendero rhetoric and the emergence of his death cult demolish naive leftist praise for this deadly insurgency; on the other hand, the reprisals that the Senderos provoked and received resulted in innocents being taken with the guilty--and the two sometimes becoming blurred.<br /><br />The energy with which he describes the attacks by the guerrillas on the Ayacucho police stations, the torture of suspects, the funerals of officers and cadets, the rain on a tin-roofed shanty where a teenaged girl guerrilla shows her interviewers the marks of her abuse by her captors: all of these vignettes unforgettably inscribe themselves on your memory.<br /><br />(Edited from a review article, \\"No Escape from the Anthill\\" at the on-line Belfast journal The Blanket)<br /> <br />(Edited from a review article, \\"No Escape from the Anthill\\" at the on-line Belfast journal The Blanket) <br />	2004-11-06

Two of my students were working on essays exploring the concepts of jihad and holy wars, so I recommended they check out Harris' argument. I've just finished the book myself, and it feels like an author's first work, with all of the energy and passion on one hand, and the grad student's (I was one too) desire to fill one's document with all of one's reading, thinking, and experiences--however tangential to the whole.<br /><br />The enthusiasm Harris brings to his thesis carries you along, but with (as he acknowledges readers often do, late in his text) a tendency to skim as you go. The neuroscientific and philosophical byways do not always end up supporting his larger points, and the enormous space given his admittedly thoughtful footnotes may point to a problem he and his editors faced when assembling his shorter but still rambling musings into a more cohesive form. I'm still puzzling over his closing statement that mysticism is more rational than religion, but it's a good koan upon which to meditate!<br /><br />His instruction that if all of us simply answered our children's questions honestly, the problems caused by unjustified dogmatic positions and unproveable belief would end appeals to me as does his assertion that we need a stronger force to end dissension caused by religious intolerance's alliance with world-ending technology. But, like many rational claims, how we could go about this seems as unsolvable a dilemma as how to forget that we know how to blow the world up in the name of a deity or a secularized creed.<br /><br />Humanists for centuries have been advancing such claims, at least since Voltaire, and, as Harris emphasizes, our world's in far more danger now that intolerance carries a nuclear and biological key to open Pandora's box once and for all. I recommend his book for its often bitterly amusing archness, its insights into the warped policies historically and currently advanced by (mid)East and Western regimes, and his defense of mystic and not religious introspection--muddled but nonetheless demanding consideration, at least on an individual level.  His desire, however, to put neuroscience, often arcane philosophical debate, and somewhat unclear analogies from these to bolster his ethical position does weaken the stability of his broader, often idealistic and impractical claims in the cause of a secular humanism that would somehow replace our habitual credulity. All in all, congratulations to him for stirring up a too complacent embrace of wobbly tolerance and patronizing acceptance of what in fact, as Harris labors mightily if too clumsily to reveal, are dangerous and life-threatening calls to destroy us all in the name of an unknowable, irrational apocalyptic eschatology.policies historically and currently advanced by (mid)East and Western regimes, and his defense of mystic and not religious introspection--muddled but nonetheless demanding consideration, at least on an individual level.

Also, the chapter that looks into the early spirituality of the first friars adds valuable understanding to what must have inspired many to take up the evangelical and mendicant challenge.<br /><br />The excursion into the Middle East, especially the siege of Damietta, remains helpful for an appreciation of the never-ending cruelty of warfare in this contentious region, but you do lose sight as a reader of the place of this episode within the immediate experience of Francis' diplomatic apostolate. In later stretches of the narrative, the debate over poverty receives important attention, but the machinations of the friars replacing the discipline of the Order's founder with a more pragmatic system needed further explanation, as did the claim by House that the refusal of the Third Order to bear arms for a lord undermined the whole feudal structure and helped advance the power of the middle class. Certainly, the latter theory deserves much more depth than House gives to it here.<br /><br />The few photos are excellent. One in particular, near to the life of the saint, shows his face hallowed out like an El Greco figure, if not as elongated, seemingly hunched over and suffering with an individuated expression as if drawn by one who knew him. It speaks eloquently for a man who, while praising nature, punished his Brother Ass of a body into an early death.<br /><br />Such a contradiction, House only can hint at, stands as his legacy.	2004-10-24

Mailer does labor mightily to bring this monsterful novel forth as a masterful tale. In the opening pages, describing death and pain, in the set-piece battle with the Hittites, in his description of being within the bowels of a tomb, in other descriptions of being within another's bowels--here, he succeeds. Like it or not, the excremental theme manages to connect the mud, the fecundity, the slime, the stink with carnal and practical and spiritual knowledge through power. I wonder if Foucault read this before he died?<br /><br />What's disappointing, then, are the stagnant patches you must slog, or more likely skim, to get to the energized portions. Nearly 650 pages, and probably no more than 150 of them reward your effort. The characters of the little queens Honey Ball and Heqat, big queen Nefertiti, the main pharoahs, and the Hittite princess do manage to leap off the page. But you miss others that needed to be drawn more distinguishably--such as the wife of the Hebrew that the protagonist marries for fourteen or so years--this whole \\"lost weekend\\" episode could have been much better written. This whole lacuna in the story sags, as if Mailer had to have the narrator pass a few years in exile in order for the rest of Egypt to move forward to catch up with him.<br /><br />As a result, the bracing plunge Mailer does give you into the mentality of an entirely alien way of faith, cosmology, and ethos manages to immerse you for long periods, only to be irritable when, as in the final stretch of the book, the care taken in parts falls apart and the story lumbers to an indifferently conveyed conclusion. As the pages go on, the narrative design of the book weakens, and the whole shift from one life to another seems to be--as in many time-travel stories--wobblier and less convincing. The ability of characters to drift in and out of each other's consciousness is an excellent device, yet it too is applied almost at random rather than with care.<br /><br />I suppose the hours I spent with this book entertained me, but the investment of time paid off with less consistent rewards than the decade Mailer spent upon its construction would lead you to believe.ellent device, yet it too is applied almost at random rather than with care.  <br /> <br />I suppose the hours I spent with this book entertained me, but the investment of time paid off with less consistent rewards than the decade Mailer spent upon its construction would lead you to believe.	2004-10-23

Each chapter's broken up into such sections, ideal for guiding meditation or inspiring reflection. It's a volume I gave away as a gift and re-purchased for myself after I read it, knowing that I'd return to its contents again and again. O'Donohue's learned much from those with whom he lives and talks and ministers, and his frequent interspersions of Celtic tradition and current Irish-language proverbs and observations attest to the continuity of the Gaelic worldview within the larger Anglo-American hegemony that dominates our lives.<br /><br />One of the best recommendations for this guide is its refusal to romanticize the rural and rooted tradition's hardships as well as its comforts. The author comes from the people he writes about, and this grounding keeps his suggestions--however philosophical they may soar--concise, honest, and free of cant. The respect for the life lived under the radar and the flyover culture by those committed to the land energizes these stories. Mixing tales and legends and theology from the Irish perspective with contemporary analogies, incidents, and insights, this book somehow avoids touchy-feely simpering or wishful fairie musings.<br /><br />It's appropriate for those of any faith, any skeptic, or any with spiritual longing. Written by a priest, but never limited to a Christian presentation, the transparent ecumenism of the author's approach speaks to any reader wondering about the Big Questions. Humbly, eloquently, and frankly, it's like having a personal confessor or soulmate with whom you can sit and listen companionably. There's no sloganeering, no ten steps to salvation in ten minutes a day, and no assurances of glib piety. With an open-hearted wonder, serious but never glum intelligence, and a generous capacity to listen to others and to nature, the wisdom distilled by the author here issues gradually, to be sipped rather than gulped. Antidotes for our fast-food generation, which will only work their healing power if we follow the prescriptions and elixirs gathered in its pages.food generation, which will only work their healing power if we follow the prescriptions and elixirs gathered in its pages.	2004-10-12

London-based journalist McCrum brings a more nuanced perspective, showing how, beginning in Dublin, going down around the southern and up the western coasts, stopping at market towns, plenty of b&b's and country houses, and ending with the North's urban terrain, he learned a more neutralized position on the \\"Irish question,\\" if never coming up with one satisfactory answer.<br /><br />Refreshingly, he spends a bit of time in areas rarely portrayed in detail either in guidebooks or travel accounts. Anglo-Norman memories in the south-east, for example, or Puck, Lisdoonvara, and Ballinasloe fairs. Even when he visits familiar settings, such as the Aran islands, Derry's Bogside, or Belfast's Peace Wall, he notices what most visitors do not, or if they do, rarely record! His skepticism and enthusiasm often mix with intriguing results. Through mysterious set-ups he often stays with well-off Irelanders, and his encounters at a Kerry artist's colony epitomize this type of isolated hothouse setting as opposed to a more gritty scenario such as his meetings with the Travelling community in Tuam, or his frank talks with Loyalists from Shankill Road.<br /><br />My only letdown was that his itinerary does not penetrate the midlands, only easing into Ballinasloe in East Co Galway as the furthest point away from the coast. A look at Longford or Offaly would've been worth it, for certainly these too are less frequented spots in which McCrum might or might not have found tales to tell or people to interview. Sticking to the circle route, he never explains really why he never went into the interior of Ireland as well. And I'm still mystified about what Bord Failte did to compensate his stay--I sometimes felt that he was set up at places free, and at others he had to fend for himself. I got the impression he may have inadvertently wound up endorsing certain hoteliers or hosts with whom he lodged.<br /><br />He avoids easy putdowns of (some of!) his fellow tourists, and keeps his language free of self-indulgent pity or easy sentiment. In the rare instances he describes natural beauty, he conveys its sensations well. And the range of accomodations never fails to keep the reader alert and bemused.

Adding to the list of favorite bon mots below, I'm chuckling over his reaction to seeing his picture on the cover of the newspaper's he's joined: Narcissus' bedroom wall. And summing up some fearsome portraits in some Anglo-Irish manse as having the hair of Barbara Stanwyck and the face of Fred MacMurray.<br /><br />The end of the account does hit rather suddenly, as if Donegan wanted to duck out with as little damage as possible--again, not surprising in an Irish rural context to which he has, if imperfectly, adapted over his stint. I would have liked some nuts and bolts knowledge: how did he survive on what the paper paid him? Did he play any more golf, being a Scotsman who's written previously about the sport? Was he living rent-free in his (former? on-and-off?) girlfriend's family's shack? Wouldn't more of his London and Glaswegian pals look him up, or call him, or e-mail him? How did the Tribune fill its pages and meet its bills? Still, the charm of Donegan's year of discovery lies more in his admittedly artful arrangement of a slew of witticisms, anecdotes, and set-pieces. Newt Gingrich gets his deserved comeuppance, by the way.<br /><br />A light read, sure, but not without it worthwhile insights into Derry, Dublin, the memories of a former pop star, a funeral, and the realization into what opting out ultimately leads one to understand.	2004-09-25

James McCloskey, a linguist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, tackles this question in his bilingual book. I found his musings far too rambling-even within the small scope of 51 pages in either language-around the world rather than addressing Irish itself. His title misleads: only chapter six and an epilogue focus upon Gaeilge. Yet, this intercontinental context has too often been neglected when addressing Ireland's language question, and his counter-parochialism exemplifies how contemporary linguists can apply issues of language death, transmission, and recovery learned over the past century-often after the Gaelic Revival-as anthropologists, missionaries, professors, and activists began to encounter many more of the approximately 6,800 languages still surviving the century after the founding of Conradh na Gaeilge. Yet, half of the world's languages will not survive this century, experts predict. In expanding and resisting imperialism, strategies of how people encode a wealth of meaning within a particular means of expressing their worldview in a microcosmic means of preservation and progression.<br /><br />McCloskey spends most of this very short book--the 51 pp. are duplicated more or less in Irish and English, although not an exact translation to the former from the latter--musing about the international threats to languages. This material can be found in such books as David Crystal's Language Death, and even for Scots Gaelic, in an earlier academic work by Nancy Dorian with the same title as Crystal's short overview. I wish McCloskey had delved more deeply into his subtopic.<br /><br />Still, alongside Darerca Ni Chartuir's The Irish Language: An Overview and Guide (2001 ed.) and Ciaran MacMurchaidh's \\"Who Needs Irish?\\" contributors (Dublin: Veritas, 2004), this raises extremely crucial points about the viability of Irish, and a rather optimistic conclusion.

A dangerous tendency by me, but I found his insistence upon non-theists apart from atheists, and agnostics apart from believers, to be a helpful breakdown of more realistic and flexible categories within which many of us think about the presence or the absence of a deity or force. He makes his arguments clearer by crediting his friends, teachers, opponents, and fellow scholars, and this adds to the humility and credibility of his message. However, I found the chapters uneven in strength, and the book could have been 150 pages and lost a hundred pages of padded--if admittedly interesting--supplemental material.<br /><br />Lacking a stronger editor, therefore, Shermer relates his anecdotes, findings, and research in an accessible manner, avoiding for the most part technical and academic jargon, but his chapters do skip about like different lectures or set-pieces that often feel disconnected from the whole, as with his contingency/necessity explanations, his musings on Ghost Dances and related messianic myths, and his rather sudden incorporation of the Belief Engine into his thesis. The uneveness grows as the book progresses, and weakens the power of his opening arguments.<br /><br />I question his claim (xiii) that \\"Never in history have so many, and such a high percentage of the population, believed in God.\\"<br /><br />Shermer does not footnote this assertion, and while many billions do of course believe in a monotheistic deity today, he cites no worldwide figures to support his claim that this is a higher percentage of the world's peoples than ever before. Yes, perhaps many today had ancestors who were pantheists or animists, but again he does not offer statistics to back up \\"such a high percentage\\" as that he proposes.<br /><br />Likewise, his surveys concentrate on educated (a bias he admits--they tend to return more complicated surveys!) Americans (a bias he in passing acknowledges in nodding only once in passing to lower levels of belief in the rest of the First World). This clouds his findings about levels of faith among scientists and the greater U.S. population alone--which has statistically higher levels of belief than the rest of the industrialized world. Leaving out the rest of the planet, developed and less-so, his findings appear limited and open to debate.<br /><br />On pg. 121, in his otherwise sensible attack on Michael Drosnin's work of psuedo-scholarship \\"The Bible Code,\\" Shermer cites Drosnin's claim \\"that all Bibles in the original Hebrew language that now exist are the same letter for letter.\\" Shermer goes on to prove this is nonsense, but I think he may be taking out of context Drosnin's context, which may be referring rather to the Torah scrolls which are hand-copied letter for letter by scribes--admittedly a different context.<br /><br />On pg. 123, Shermer sums up his argument well: \\"Why do you need science to prove God? You do not. These scientific proofs of God are not only an insult to science; to those who are deeply religious they are an insult to God.\\" Also, on pg. 141, he quotes Edward O. Wilson's \\"reality check\\" for skeptics, which those on Amazon trapped in the imbroglio of trying to use reason to prove or disprove faith should remember: \\"Their crisply logical salvos, endorsed by whole arrogances of Nobel laureates, pass like steel-jacketed bullets through fog.\\"<br /><br />Shermer spends much of the remaining hundred pages off on tangents that intrigue but do not add substantially to the basic argument he has already made: keep the two areas of fides et ratio apart, for neither can convince the other. He does get in some good points taking apart the pros and cons of the current Pope's proclamations on the these two approaches to human inquiry. Shermer, unlike the Pope, insists that we leave each realm up to its adherents. He ends his bookin a moving testimony to the sense that a skeptic can carry of the numinous, a fitting resolution to the open-ended embrace this book seeks.s his book in a moving testimony to the sense that a skeptic can carry of the numinous, a fitting resolution to the open-ended embrace this book seeks.	2004-09-17

While I did not support the choice made by the protagonist, Sy, at the end, and sympathized more than perhaps I was supposed to with the antagonist, I found this evocation of the Cold War period as spent at a cow college in a small town in the Northwest gripping and surprisingly convincing in its indirect narrative style, which mimics not only the patterns of thinking in Sy's mind, but springs off at times into Joycean reverie.<br /><br />I have only read Malamud's The Assistant, and that in college, so my pleasure at his plot became all the more pronounced when I found so much of the setting alarmingly familiar--I teach English too at a non-liberal arts college, run by number-crunching techies, so Sy's predicaments--although now I doubt if he could land his position without a PhD--stayed fresh despite happening half-a-century ago.<br /><br />Issues of academic freedom, nourishing of the soul, escape into nature and ideals vs. the mundane may be new material for those used to Malamud's urban explorations of often NY and Jewish characters, but here it all works. I was mildly intrigued that Sy's Jewishness never gains but one mention, near the end of the novel, but is assumed, I suppose, throughout as he is marked by his beard and his \\"East Coast\\" origins as an outsider all the time. The near-absence of religion and the substitution of a longing for nature, perhaps a Wordsworthian sort of wonder, permeates much of the lyrical passages interspersed with the more tormented episodes--which gain as the book lengthens.<br /><br />The book has a bit of slapstick and a lot of farce in the predicaments Sy gets himself into, but I can testify that much of Malamud's take on such an institution remains relevant today, in a much more constrained academic job market for such profs-to-be. Again, a measure of the skill Malamud brings is both the detachment the third-person p-o-v offers of Sy (who never leaves our sight) and the engagement with the other characters we see through his jaundiced eyes, and the fact, as I stated, that your sympathies may not be fully with Sy by the book's close.skill Malamud brings is both the detachment the third-person p-o-v offers of Sy (who never leaves our sight) and the engagement with the other characters we see through his jaundiced eyes, and the fact, as I stated, that your sympathies may not be fully with Sy by the book's close.	2004-09-14

Seemingly an impossible task to attain on the page, but his decades as a musician allow him to capture the spirit behind the music. As they say, it's not how you read the notes, but how you hear them.<br /><br />His chapter headings refer to various titles of Irish songs, and I enjoyed his rendering of differing reasons (or lack of) for how various tunes get attached to specific names. A much better book than \\"Round Ireland with a Tin Whistle\\" by David Wilson for its ability to convey the feel of how music changes with every playing, and how fluid the communication between players can be in a seisuin.<br /><br />Any book Carson writes deserves a read, whether his version of Dante's Inferno, his prose-poem-fiction of late, his explorations of his city's past, or his crafted if learned verse.<br /><br />He opens up a bit more here than in some of his earlier works, and the glimpses into the world he lives in between nights playing makes for intriguing scenes.	2004-09-13
US	53087372	R1MXFCLFN2YHEO	037542234X	949761823	Interesting Times: A Twentieth-Century Life	Books	3	9	13	N	N	A donnish interpreter for the working class	After a slow 150 pages in which Hobsbaum tells of his birth in 1917 in Alexandria to a Jewish father, son of an &eacute;migr&eacute; cabinet-maker, and a Viennese jeweller's daughter followed by his youth in Austria and then Weimar Berlin and his stint at Cambridge, his story gains energy, if intermittently. Certainly Hobsbaum has led, after a rather tenuous period of living hand-to-mouth via the courtesy of relations and friends, a life more comfortable than that gained by many, communist or capitalist. His adherence to the Communist Party for so much of his life, from his profession in 1932 in Germany to his joining in 1936 and his allegiance throughout Stalinism and after the Hungarian revolt of 1956 motivates his four-hundred page apologia. Balancing his ideological commitment to a concomitant refusal to accept dogma results in a curious tension. How can a securely employed, well-travelled, multi-lingual, and nimbly minded individual stay loyal to a cause that rallied the poor and the intellectual while committing so many murders in its name?<br /><br />Hobsbaum argues well his reasoning. Surprisingly, little of his book recapitulates his scholarly mission, the fame of which derives first from his popularising of the earlier century's \\"primitive rebels,\\" those who resisted capitalisation and globalisation and their own redundancy. Far too many pages provide lists of luncheons, flights, and friends. Hobsbaum warns the reader that little of his private life will emerge here, and his sons gain only a couple of sentences here and there, for example; their half-brother, apparently the result of an affair in-between his two marriages, is mentioned in half-a-sentence. Instead, as the blurb and the cover images trumpet, Hitler, Che, and the Soviet Man of Steel gain attention, and even more the milieu in which he and his internationalists roamed in between seminars and scholarship-again, little of the classroom to be found here. Hobsbaum actually gives little insight into the Great Men, but much on his mates.<br /><br />Idiosyncratically, the book's form skips about. Most of it tracks his own career, while latter chapters sum up his thoughts and chats in France, Italy, Spain, the Third World, and the U.S. One chapter, fascinating to me for its oblique mirroring of recent Ireland, takes on the land of his holiday home in Wales near the eccentric Clough Williams-Ellis, builder of among other wonders, the seaside resort of Portmeirion, later the site of the 1960s television series The Prisoner. In this chapter, the author carefully analyses the resurgence of Welsh separatism in that decade, to the point that it drove him to a safer and more anglicised portion of the principality in which to vacation. Hobsbaum dismisses \\"ethnolinguistic nationalism\\" and has little time for the 1960s legacy of individualism that led to the promotion of non-conformity at the expense of the social ideal for which earlier revolutionaries had struggled.<br /><br />Hobsbaum pinpoints the crucial difference between himself and later radicals. He is one of the last living intellectuals inspired to hoist the Red flag by the events in the year of his birth. A teenager when he cast his lot with the German communists just before Hitler's consolidation of power, Hobsbaum defends his faith in Marx. While later converts recanted once the allure of the anti-fascist crusade dimmed, Hobsbaum emphasises that he remained a believer after Khrushchev's decision to undermine the monolithic power of the CPSU in 1956-the second time that \\"ten days shook the world.\\" \\"To put it in the simplest terms,\\" he summarises, \\"the October Revolution created a world communist movement, the Twentieth Congress destroyed it.\\" (201) Because Hobsbaum and his CP allies had been lied to, \\"something that had to affect the very nature of a communist's belief,\\" the concealment of the truth about Stalin led to the instability of an presumed solid façade of political and cultural endurance, and foreshadowed the fall of the Wall.<br /><br />Which perhaps was a Potemkin village, but one where, Hobsbaum claims, protection against the harsh blows of capitalism and unrestrained greed did enable Soviets and those under their subjection to pursue a laudable goal of communist equality and worldwide fraternity. Hobsbaum cautiously tiptoes around the conflict of the dream with the reality.<br /><br />He acknowledges that communists like himself and their western parties never had to govern from a position of actual power, and therefore mitigates the decisions made by those who did rule in the name of the working class. No creed since Islam in the seventh century, he reminds us, spread so rapidly and so far across our planet.<br /><br />Speaking of this takeover, Hobsbaum elides complications. He compares the removal of communist ministers in western governments circa 1947 with their inclusion in non-communist administrations \\"in the countries under communist rule.\\" (180) He laments the establishment of the Orwellian-monikered Cominform before continuing: `The Eastern regimes, deliberately not set up as communist, but as pluriparty \\"new\\" or \\"peoples' democracies\\" with mixed economies, were now assimilated to the \\"dictatorship of the proleteriat\\", i.e. the standard Communist Party dictatorships.' The author seems to skip over how a country can be \\"under communist rule\\" with a mixed economy and a pluriparty regime for long, before being standardised as a CP one-party dictatorship, given the logic of communist consolidation of power within a single party model. And, from my admittedly non-specialist understanding of those nations soon to be mortared into the façade of the Eastern bloc, such a pluriparty system was never seriously intended to survive, given the 1943 Tehran conference and the Cold War's surrender to the USSR of those Central and Eastern European nations as a buffer zone to defend Stalin's empire.<br /><br />Hobsbaum confused me with a statement about one of those buffer nations with which I have some familiarity, Hungary. Discussing an intellectual who claimed to be a victim of Soviet repression post-1956 who in fact was a Party organiser after the revolt, the author states: `Unfortunately in the course of those years, under the benevolent eye of the Kadar government, the sympathizers with the 1956 movement, that is to say the bulk of the communist intellectuals and the academics, quietly re-established their positions.' (145)<br /><br />Those less informed about Hungary at this time might misconstrue this passage, intended to contrast the fake refugee from the revolt with his comrades who remained, as praising the regime of Kadar, who pretended to side with the rebels only to turncoat to the Soviet invaders as they returned to crush the revolt, and to imply that the majority of those who were sympathisers with the rebellion suffered no harm under the Kadar regime. Although a communist revolt, the Hungarians sought neutrality apart from the Warsaw Pact and a mixed economy. These aims, Hobsbaum agrees, could not have been tolerated under Soviet domination, but he diminishes the struggle of those who sought a more human face for socialism by too often defending the Russian bear's slashes across the face of those who defied its imperial might, feigned as a blow for people's equality.<br /><br />Throughout his book, Hobsbaum distances himself from Judaism and Zionism, in the name of a greater identity with the oppressed everywhere. Yet his early identification with the position of the outsider, the alien, and the non-conformist (witness too his long championship in scholarship and avocation of an appreciation for jazz) could only have been gained by his Judaic stance, secular as it was, and his similar oppositional decision to embrace communism at fourteen. I find his lack of sympathy for Israel predictable therefore, but still would like to know what alternatives could have existed for his relatives who did not survive thecamps, or those who did survive in a hostile Europe.<br /><br />His detachment from issues like these when they effect the individual may be attributed to his rather distanced position as that outsider, whether in Wales, in London, in Berlin, or in Alexandria (although his lectureships at the New School in New York City, at Stanford and the Getty Center, or his frequent global trips in search of like-minded companions sounded quite enjoyable to me). He claims that after his forties, whatever happened of note in his life was inside his head, and these transatlantic odysseys merely widened his intellectual horizons. Or maybe not, as he remained loyal to the Cause throughout the Cold War, despite New Labour, and now in spite of Bush. His chapters on the rest of the world outside the dons' room and the overseas seminar open up many intriguing insights, but I never felt that Hobsbaum was quite on the same level as us proles.<br /><br />A sample, taken from a discussion of the Party's `cultural group' protesting in 1956: `The Indo-Scandinavian intellectual Palme Dutt, one of those implausibly tall upper-class figures one occasionally meets among Bengalis, belonged through his mother to an eminent Swedish kindred-Olaf Palme, the socialist premier assassinated in 1986, was another member.' (208-9) This, like his analogy of labeled decanters in \\"the combination room\\" at Cambridge to keep dons from confusing their port and their sherry, speak of a privileged world in which Hobsbaum has earned his eminence, and one where, his communism to the contrary, he continues to thrive. It is natural for any of us to write from the position we know, so I don't mean to criticise the laurels which Hobsbaum has earned, but I do wish to point out that, as he confesses, `somewhere inside of me there is a small ghost who whispers: \\"One should not be at ease in a world such as ours.\\" As the man said when I read him in my youth: \\"The point is to change it.\\"' (313).

I enjoyed the authors' incorporation of weather catastrophes, tree-ring dating, metallurgy, and archeological scenarios that enlivened the first part of the book. In my opinion, this area could've gained much more in-depth treatment, as the later, post-Patrician era has been done to death repeatedly. But I admit I learned more here than from Thomas Cahill's book, and in a much more stimulating context. The Bronze Age clarified, the myth of the Celtic invasions faded, and the appeal of the Beaker Folk widened. Now finally I know how copper was discovered, too!<br /><br />Also, in later periods, as with their explanation of potentially soporific subjects like the Eoganacht rivalry with the Ui Neill, the tensions behind Brian Boru's struggle to regain sovereignty, the Viking-Irish uneasy contest and co-existence, and the legends of Patrick and why the northern powers at Armagh propagandized his cult, McCaffrey and Eaton present dramatizations effectively, and not having seen the PBS/RTE videos, I imagine these emerge even more vividly on screen. For many raised on pseudo-Celtic, often 19c-originated founding myths of supposedly Irish lore, the findings here -- reminding me of historical criticism and how it overthrew earlier readings of the Bible in the 19-20 c's -- will be revelatory.<br /><br />My disappointment lies in the two authors' lack of footnotes. Although a bibliography is given, the absolute lack of following up many of the co-authors' assertions makes this a book that cannot satiate the curiosity of those readers eager to delve further into specific topics raised. While the scholars active in the making of the videos are credited in the preface and in the text when interviewed, their ideas are not necessarily those that the authors use for all of their own assumptions. The lack of follow-through here that would and should have linked the authors with their oral and printed primary and secondary sources diminishes the value of an otherwise promising overview of the pre-1171 period. Still, given the dearth of non-\\"magickal\\" and non-academically oriented books introducing readers to this period, it's a worthwhile -- if less than ideal -- survey of early Irish history.gh here that would and should have linked the authors with their oral and printed primary and secondary sources diminishes the value of an otherwise promising overview of the pre-1171 period.

And our time and place is a world, a society that emphasizes the technological rather than the personal (despite what advertisers might have us believe), the superficial and fleeting rather than the profound, the commercial at the expense of the communal. All these changes have their price, and the casualties we can see all around us. (12)<br /><br />Here, Lenihan speaks for all of us who witness the recent decades that have transformed the physical and spiritual Irish landscapes irrevocably. Lenihan's compilation of oral testimony, mainly gathered from the region, witnesses a less manicured environment. There, ringforts survive as fairy redoubts, lights dance and dust puffs as evidence of fairy activity, and those of us who dare to cross to their side live shortly or longer afterwards, seemingly at the whim of beings diminished in size but not in power. Speaking Irish, hurling, dancing, they represent the survival of a \\"hidden Ireland\\" refusing to capitulate to the modern age, just as Daniel Corkery wrote, perhaps romantically I admit, of the 18c bards clinging to the their remnants of an indigenous Munster mentality. Lenihan's collected accounts of rural informants tell us of an era that may, I hazard, hearken back to a \\"race memory\\" of the Iron Age, as the indigenous people retreated before the triumph of the unbending ax and the steely blade, so that their descendants the Tuatha de Danaan cringe before the mower's scythe or the spalpeen's knife, while we flee from their nocturnal hegemony across flowing water to at least temporary refuge.<br /><br />Many who read these stories in urban Ireland or abroad, as Lenihan observes, hide their unease by scoffing at--or denying these tales as those of--a skittish and inebriated peasantry. The storyteller takes pains to gradually let these reactions surrender to, at least in an older generation, the revelation of their own rumours, those of a friend of a friend, that often parallel the encounters he has gathered over the past quarter-of-a-century, He tells us that his audience has to be able to remember a time before 1970 or so to recall any such tales.<br /><br />This reminded me of the sign I saw at the National Irish Folk Museum outside Castlebar. It requested visitors to fill out forms if they wanted to share their own rural memories, specifying, however, that these needed to be prior to 1960. Between Lenihan and the National Museum system, we notice the great division between those (like myself) who remain cut off from the other side of the water, living always in a land where television silenced the seanachai, and the tales of the dark faded when, as you can see on your evening stroll, the blue light emitted from the box in every room near at least one window of nearly every electrified domestic interior.<br /><br />In the depopulated hinterlands, the old folks tell their stories of the other side (the \\"wee folk\\" or its like never finding an expression in these respectful pages.) Lenihan analyses each account in an afterward combining deftly a folklorist's skill and a reciter's interpretation. He avoids skepticism and enthusiasm admirably, balancing his sympathy with the vanished culture these tales capture with a frank admission that this culture will never revive.<br /><br />(Excerpted and edited from a review article in the on-line Belfast-based journal The Blanket.)nder to, at least in an older generation, the revelation of their own rumours, those of a friend of a friend, that often parallel the encounters he has gathered over the past quarter-of-a-century, He tells us that his audience has to be able to remember a time before 1970 or so to recall any such tales.  <br /> <br />This reminded me of the sign I saw at the National Irish Folk Museum outside Castlebar.

Dorothea Hast and Stanley Scott, practitioners and scholars both, visit a seisiun at Gleesons pub in Clare near the Miltown Malbay centre of melodic pilgrimage, interview traditional singers Len Graham from Glenarm and his wife, Padraigin Ni Uallachain, from Louth, and analyze a performance held at Trinity Inn near the college in Dublin under the auspices of the Goilin Singer's Club. By concentrating on these three manifestations of the current Irish scene, emphasising in turn the instrumental, the sean-nos and song tradition, and the song as both perpetuating the tradition and welcoming the innovative, Hast and Scott provide an overview easily enjoyed in a couple of sittings along with the accompanying 28-track CD, keyed to their informative text.<br /><br />Although designed for the classroom, this volume can inform anyone about the background, current context, and permutations of Irish music. I was impressed by the ease in which musicologists Hast and Scott integrate technical terms into their text designed for the rank novices like me to musical terminology. The activities allow you to learn from the CD track at specified moments in your reading, and particularly impressive I found one example. Piper Jerry O'Sullivan offers multiple versions of \\"Garrett Barry's Jig.\\" The first is a stripped-down version transcribed for the beginning student. The notes simplify the melody. The second version adds ornaments. The third time through, with the use of the regulators of the instrument, adds even more intricacies. As a careful listener to the pipes, the combination of the three scores and the three takes added immeasurably to my comprehension of what, if I had been presented only with the audio tracks, would have sounded like lots of flash added to a straightforward tune.<br /><br />The connection of the pub session and the repertoire with the local emerges strongly in these pages. Hast and Scott could have wandered all 32 counties and given a thumbnail rundown of famous players or notable tunes in these 150 pages. Instead, they study the etiquette, the passing on of tunes, the respect paid the elders, and the democracy of the audience and players, as all who play and sing thus gain appreciation in turn. The incident down the road or up the lane, as so many titles show, the inspiration of a particular player, and the commemoration of battles and courtships long faded remain memorialised but never mummified. The context emerges in the playing and the singing, ever-shifting but still reified. Each playing and recital changes the structure but leaves the scaffolding in place for the next builder. Eschewing the gazateer approach, the authors' choice to zero in on three locales heightens their primacy of the community within what continues to be passed on within the Irish traditional repertoire, and what is added.<br /><br />After an injury of a famous musician, the authors note that within a week or so not one but two ballads had been composed about his mishap while playing at doubles. E-mail and phone only accelerate the transmission of the oral tradition, it seems. Similarly, the ability to tape performances, to sell recordings, and share by technological advances the wealth of musical variation only increases the lustre of the treasure to which musicians and singers contribute. `In each postindependence generation of Irish musicians, individuals have had to choose between the urban, upbeat high-volume allure of swing, rock and roll country and western, heavy metal, or rap and the more rural, frequently slower-paced, quieter, intimate appeal of Irish music'. (96)  Now, on the other hand, musicians and singers can mix forms. While in my opinion the hybrids can be dreadful, they do expose younger listeners to the older forms.<br /><br />The gamut of players and singers treated shows this heterogeneity. While any listener or player may lament who or what's been left out, you must admit that the range can certainly educate the beginner or the advanced fan of Irish music of the diversity we are lucky to hear and share now. For example: Carolan harp tunes, West Clare and Sligo fiddle, ceili bands from the 1940s, vocals from John McCormack, Joe Heaney, Andy Irvine, and Gleesons pub singers, sean-nos from Ni Uallachain and Scots-Irish song from Graham, and members of Lunasa live and in session demonstrating some of the finer points of the text, to which Hast and Scott also enrich their own musical collaborations. The text covers the history of Irish music effectively, although the influential and detrimental Dance Halls Act of 1935 in the south needed more explanation, as it weakened the ability of individuals to hold their own musical gatherings and seems to have been instigated by the Church and the Dublin government to weaken rural choices for venues. I wondered if this was part of the anti-jazz campaign undertaken by republicans in the middle of that decade, but the text offers no context. Dance tune traditions and their instruments in turn receive a few paragraphs; from this I learned of the bodhran's very recent rise in popularity and that of the uilleann pipes, both having entered the limelight only during the 60s and 70s. The decline of the harp and the ascent of the fiddle still puzzled me due to their too brief treatment here. Why the concertina became the \\"woman's instrument\\" can be traced, intriguingly, to not only its relative affordability early last century but its sale at hardware stores.<br /><br />Throughout this survey, Ciaran Carson, Belfast poet-musician, from his estimable Last Night's Fun (1996), the ultimate print on Irish sound, continues to be cited. Near the end of Hast and Scott quote Carson--<br /><br />'Each time the song is sung, our notions of it change, and we are changed by it. The words are old. They have been worn into shape by many ears and mouths and have been contemplated often. But every time is new because the time is new, and there is no time like now.' (116; in Hast and Scott, 135). As with the language, so the music and the native culture. All are enriched by the blow-ins and the strangers, but never is the root torn away.

While many books now offer the novice \\"training wheels\\" to steady a ride through the Hibernian labyrinth, fewer meet the demands of intermediate readers in an accessible manner that can be recommended to non-academic, amateur Joyceans. While much freer of jargon than many of his scholarly peers, Schwarz' study is not a book to skim. I'm not even sure that RJU is the perfect answer for the repeat reader--much of the first hundred pages I found very dense, both exhausting and stimulating in turn, and I'm a literature professor! But, as the author insists, Joyce demands more of us than other writers, and we need to work out to meet the challenge and earn the reward. No pain, no gain, indeed.<br /><br />As a coach, Schwarz in his \\"humanistic formalism\\" teaches us a sensible interpretation based on Joyce's \\"metaferocity.\\" This plan charts the metaphorical circles around the Bloomsday core, and explores some of their ripples. His thesis: 'If the result of the action of Ulysses is to enable a more mature and gifted Stephen-Joyce to write Ulysses, the result of reading Ulysses is to enable us to become consubstantial with the plenitude of Joycean voices.'(61)  He argues throughout against those critics who claim that the style of the book, especially in its latter half, overwhelms the tale and its characters.<br /><br />To support this, his defense of the difficult chapters such as Eumaeus and Ithaca advances his proof that here the style captures the problems Stephen and Bloom have in establishing a true rapport. Earlier, he draws upon Bloom's Jewishness to illuminate a crucial distinction between the pair: \\"Joyce is also contrasting a characteristic Jewish turn toward tomorrow and acceptance of today--even while being fully conscious of the frustrations of the present and disappointments of the past--with the Irish preoccupation with a romanticized version of the past and the Catholic obsession wuth dwelling on past sins and measuring every action according to a strict and narrow barometer of sins and grace.\\" (105) Furthermore, although many of Schwarz' suppositions do strain a bit of credulity (I fail to see despite twice being assured that 16 by the term itself clearly symbolizes homosexuality; his reading of Bloom as one of the 36 Wise Men, a lamed vov, of Jewish tradition does not seem supported in Cyclops; or his claim that the pair's relationship fails to be obscured by the prose of Oxen of the Sun), I did enjoy immensely his playful exegesis linking the Citizen and his cronies at Barney Kiernan's to a nearly complete Seder!<br /><br />A couple of drawbacks: a tendency by the author to ask every couple of pages stiltedly \\"Do we not see\\" or \\"Must we then not claim\\" types of questions when assertions would've strengthened his claims better. Also, once in an endnote and once in the text, paragraphs from earlier in his text reappear verbatim. Added to this a need to proofread for typos and errors such as \\"principle\\" for \\"principal\\" leaves me a bit disappointed at the quality control exerted upon the manuscript.<br /><br />Still, a worthwhile exertion for those taking on Ulysses after the training wheels have come off and the need to enter a mental marathon impels the reader to return yet again to mid-June 1904.<br /><br />Half-a-star rounded up for effort. 3 1/2- 3 3/4 stars, more precisely.wuth dwelling on past sins and measuring every action according to a strict and narrow barometer of sins and grace.\\" (105) Furthermore, although many of Schwarz' suppositions do strain a bit of credulity (I fail to see despite twice being assured that 16 by the term itself clearly symbolizes homosexuality; his reading of Bloom as one of the 36 Wise Men, a lamed vov, of Jewish tradition does not seem supported in Cyclops; or his claim that the pair's relationship fails to be obscured by the prose of Oxen of the Sun), I did enjoy immensely his playful exegesis linking the Citizen and his cronies at Barney Kiernan's to a nearly complete Seder!

It looks like a compendium of material easily found on the net or other books, I first thought. But after reading it, it does do justice to its title. It collects in one handbook what Irish is, where it's been, and where it's going. The directory of website already has some dead links, inevitably, but this collection helps readers find both print and electronic references, publishers, and provides a great overall reading list that updates Seosamh McCluskey's guide to books in Irish from a decade ago.<br /><br />This book fills a needed gap in a primer not for learning the actual language but providing a context, useful for small group learners, independent learners, or college or cultural center classes. A match with Gabriel Rosenstock's Beginning Irish, which is cited by Ni Chartuir, would be ideal for beginners. My only caveat is that some of Ni Chartuir's book appears to be padded, overlapping with Rosenstock and what can be found in other sources--with her coverage of common words on signs and the like too scanty when more worthwhile suggestions on musical and audio learning helps needed to be expanded instead in her text. I also wish her comments on the various books and tapes teaching Irish were more critical, as there's a big difference between O Siadhail's Learning Irish and Teach Yourself Irish, for instance, in quality, emphasis, and accent, as well as much criticism of these by learners. Turas Teanga, by the way, appears too recently for inclusion, but would be worthwhile to compare to the Now You're Talking/Irish On Your Own or Cogar cassettes. The CD-ROMs gain also too little in-depth treatment.<br /><br />An added thanks for Nikki Ragsdale (a noted learner turned fluent speaker herself) in the editing and handsome endpapers. The book is a pleasure to hold and its pages (in the hardcover) are designed for durability within a dignified cover and binding.<br /><br />Particularly noteworthy is the appendix with essays by those who have taken immersion courses in Ireland. (See Steve Fallon's \\"Home With Alice: A Journey Through Gaelic Ireland,\\" for a longer account (reviewed by me on Amazon) in part about Aras Ui Chadhain in An Cheathru Rua (Carraroe) in Conamara.) The writers give an uneven amount of information, but by far the best is the last one, Seamus O Finneadh's excellent account of moving from his in-home Gaeltacht to sessions at Oideas Gael at Glencolumbkille in Donegal. If such a collection as Ni Chartuir's inspires more to become gaeilgoiri, or lovers and acquirers of Irish, then the price of this slim volume is a bargain indeed.<br /><br />{Since this was published, more books have appeared.

The success of McG's recent novels Amongst Women and By the Lake/That They May Face the Rising Sun casts a soft light upon his earlier fiction from the 1960s, but this novel is no romantic landscape.<br /><br />In the bogs of west-central Ireland, a policeman cycles about pretending to do his duty while his wife takes care of the children and waits to find out whether she has a terminal disease. Told in a powerful voice largely from within her consciousness, the narrative style shows amazing assurance for a then emerging writer. The last scene from her point-of-view ranks in my estimation with Joyce's closing of \\"The Dead.\\"<br /><br />I heard McG introduced at a reading as the greatest Irish author from the second half of the 20th (and 21st?) century. This is no hyperbole. While his reticence means he is not the showman that Seamus Heaney is, and while his oblique commentary acknowledges the trauma of the past Irish century rather than exploiting it like many of his lesser contemporaries, McG's dignity in the face of 1960s censorship (for subsequent work) commands respect and a renewal of interest in his entire body of work. Read this story and you'll find the ebb of rural Ireland charted precisely.	2004-08-08

The natural beauties sullied by strip malls, as is happening now to his native Ireland, the power of the churches in decline, the pop culture obliterating earlier memories of a more rural and depressing era. I did not find this book as uproarious as other reviewers, but I appreciated his determination to investigate below the surface impressions that do clutter this narrative.<br /><br />It reminded me at first of the Bill Bryson/PJ O'Rourke school of travelogue, which piles up observation, one-liners, seemingly random conversations, town-by-town itineraries, and accounts of mundane meals to somehow stumble upon cultural criticism. His accounts of Elvis, JFK, and NYC seem irrelevant to the theme of his book, but they do express his curiosity with these icons of America. I liked his vignettes of pols Al Smith and James Michael Curley much more, he warms up when it comes to musical contexts, and his incorporation of extracts from letters from earlier immigrants home to their Irish families introduces each chapter with an appropriately chosen contrast regarding Irish America.<br /><br />The somewhat strained whimsy makes for a very uneven read. In my opinion, Pete McCarthy's \\"McCarthy's Bar\\"--later in the 90s--has one advantage over O'C's similar reporting: McC adds the longing for the spiritual nearly absent from O'C's perspective. Of course, this reflects each man's own personality, but the lack of an escape from the everyday does ground \\"Sweet Liberty\\" in a too quotidian reality.<br /><br />Although I must add that, as with every struggling comedian, some of his witticisms are spot on, and he leaves the best of these for last, a sign of his emerging gift for telling a great anecdote. It's just that the book runs out of steam--as he does--before the end, and the energy of the opening chapters fades as Yankee novelty vanishes: the immigrant's experience repeated.<br /><br />So, this may be O'C's point, but I do think that the relative youth when he wrote this, no more than thirty, shows he needed to mature as a writer. Which he has a decade since--if you read his Dickensian historical novel about immigrants, \\"Star of the Sea.\\"vanishes: the immigrant's experience repeated.<br /><br />So, this may be O'C's point, but I do think that the relative youth when he wrote this, no more than thirty, shows he needed to mature as a writer.

Although apparently out-of-print in the US, it's easily found at airport booksellers, any bookshop in Ireland, or many of those tourist info offices.

I just heard McG read from this novel (the gold watch scene) in Galway, and perhaps I can add a bit of his comments that may help potential or veteran readers. (Amazon deleted my original review from this sentence forward--I can't figure out why.) Briefly, everything in this novel happens twice: thus the circularity and repetition. Also, the fixity of place and time comes from McG's belief that starting in one place and time remains essential for a writer's craft. If you like this novel, read his collected stories and look for his earlier five novels.<br /><br />He celebrates rural life, while never romanticizing it: a difficult task. While this narrative may lack action, it offers drama to the patient listener to his prose, which demands to be read aloud. McG's attention to his vocation shows in the decade he spent on this latest work. Next, he will provide his memoirs!	2004-07-31

I read it after the recent Jamie O'Neill's &quot;At Swim, Two Boys,&quot; and found Plunkett easier going if no less nuanced. Both authors revive a vanished Dublin, a decade or so after Bloomsday, and explore the roots of what would become the 1916 Easter Rising. While SC often is claimed to be a novelisation of the labour leader Jim Larkin and the Lockout strike that paralysed the city, JL actually appears only in a cameo of a few paragraphs. The plot's more about those who work, who must decide to keep off the job or give in due to the pressures of survival. The novel is rather lengthy, but the period it captures, by the accumulation of detail, carries you along easily. Plunkett almost never slips when letting the story continue its momentum, and his style is deceptively transparent.<br /><br /> Particularly evocative, given the time in which Plunkett published (1969), when Irish writers were beginning to be able to publish fiction that offered a greater realism in their depictions of sexuality, is his characterisation of the tensions within liaisons. He portrays alcoholism, vagrancy, and poverty vividly, and avoids cliche in what, perhaps not at first glance, remains a well-researched and engrossing historical fiction.<br /><br /> Perhaps Plunkett is unfairly ignored today as more of a &quot;popular&quot; than an intellectual Irish writer, but I urge you to seek this book out (I found mine in a Salvation Army thrift shop, but most large public libraries should have a copy) and then turn to his ambitious and often quite powerful short stories. Sure, he labors in the shadow of Joyce from a generation or two before, but he manages--at his best as here--to craft satisfying and challenging work that delves deeper into realistic presentations of his now vanished Ireland than many readers realise today. Beneath the stereotypes still marring much of what audiences expect as &quot;true&quot; Irish narrative, his fiction remains a reminder of the past decades now fading from living memory, and for that deserves to be rediscovered by us.s &quot;true&quot; Irish narrative, his fiction remains a reminder of the past decades now fading from living memory, and for that deserves to be rediscovered by us.	2004-07-31

This biography, admittedly massive in its investigation of every detail extant of McQ's long career, never flags, even if not all the information is scintillating. I found the humanity of the \\"AB\\" touching at moments, against the stereotype that most hold him in today, and Cooney deftly weighs the harsh legacy which ultimately weakened the Church in Ireland against the struggles McQ faced personally and professionally as his ambition to become Cardinal and primate of All-Ireland never were fulfilled.<br />Surprising vignettes pepper the text. My two favorites: his rat-shooting skills and his questioning of clerics about what kind of underwear soldiers wore in the US Army. The sad dealings with sexual abuse do gain careful explanation here, even if the evidence IMHO is not air-tight, McQ's life does show the price paid for the Jansenist scruples inherited by his own Congregation and dictated to so many of the Irish people during his tenure. The struggles with DeValera over the Constitution of 1937 gain much scrutiny here, a very critical contributor to the social climate of mid-20c Catholic Ireland.<br />A fine resource for scholars and an accessible read for the rest of us too!	2004-07-12

As other reviewers have noted, this book's a third Y., a third his influences (Evola, Spengler, occult and geopolitik tomes), and a third relationships or hunches with realms as varied as S&M, ADL informants, a supposed Auschwitz survivor, pan-European fascists, occult and Indo-European adepts, and more Communists and anti-semites with Jewish spouses than you'd assume.<br />His research is exhaustive, his footnotes beyond the most diligent striver for tenure, and his style starts out journalistically charged but descends for most of the 600 pages into turgid analysis and energetically formulated but often thematically dull reporting. After preparing the reader halfway through for a breakthrough into the New Fascist Order of which Yockey was a harbinger, the rest of the work's anti-climactic.<br />Hard to believe such ideas, expressed so opaquely by their innovators and popularizers, gained any audience at all. Still, I learned about Spengler, Evola, and the Ahnenerbe investigations under Himmler which labored to find pre-Christian foundations for Aryan and European culture. The letters extracted from Yockey's Belgian lover, Elsa Dewette and the antics of Mana Truhill make entertaining reading, and the appendices exploring how Yockey's influence may have echoed into many other niches all record worthwhile information.<br />But Coogan's thoroughness makes for a daunting read, and I fought sleep more than once. It's a useful reference for the very few needing such a work, but I wish the popular biography had been scaled down and more left to the footnotes. I applaud Coogan's skill in managing to summarize so much recondite and often mind-numbing material for a wider audience, and recognize that much of the difficulty with his book comes from the sheer impenetrability of much of this primary material for us dolts.	2004-07-08

It swings back and forth between an old woman's recollections and her younger self, in a country-like-Hungary, during WW2. This arc is intersected by another woman, who confronts her father's remarriage at one point and his funeral at the other. The choices the women make propel the play's momentum. Not having seen this work on stage, it's difficult at first to put the pieces together, but careful reading and especially an &quot;ear&quot; to the polyphonic voices within the plot turn what may at first sound like an academic exercise into a moving commemoration of loss and gain. I look forward to more from this playwright, born in England 1969 to an Hungarian father, and now living in Dublin.	2004-07-07

Fat Lad tries more obviously to capture the unpredicatability; Number 5, his most recent work, offers a more mature, steadily microcosmic view over the past half-century. Here, in a story based loosely on Peter Ward, in 1966 reckoned the second victim of &quot;the troubles,&quot; Patterson limns the sectarian divide and also, more to the point/pint, Belfast's shared joys and sorrows. Sounds predictable and perhaps cliched, yes, but read this, and see how Patterson transcends predictablity. He may not have garnered the attention of Robert MacLiam Wilson with his boisterous louts Ripley Bogle and those from Eureka Street, but Patterson may prove better equipped with the stamina to outlast his brasher competitors Colin Bateman and MacL-W, as his narrative foregoes glitz or shenanigans for a a deeper psychological resonance.	2004-07-07

On its own, if Patterson had not surpassed it in his later efforts The International and Number 5, it'd have merited another star. But placed beside these two works, it suffers a bit by P's compulsion to stuff it full of everything he's thought of since writing his debut, Burning Your Own, with its barely teenaged protagonist. Itching now to create a grown-up character, in Fat Lad he sets out, as the acronymical title indicates, to give us the ultimate Six County statement.<br />My favorite parts took place in the bookstore that sets out to resist the chainstores' assault. Any booklover will find much fascinating material here as a backdrop. The characters, while engaging, seem too verbose and the plot too cluttered to truly highlight Patterson's talents, which emerge better when focussed on smaller settings and less grand ambitions. Still, for any one wanting to learn about Belfast around the later 1980s, this novel serves as its evocation and commemoration.	2004-07-07

A couple each time; unfortunately, these were impossible to find on cd (cassette even out-of-print in more than one instance) if you lived more than a few miles from the musician, I reckon!<br />This inevitable let down between supply and demand for those outside of the countries who want to hear the music does frustrate armchair listeners like me. Go to the Egyptian chapter, for example, and you'll find that most of the genre's picks are bootlegged as tapes in the market stands. Since 1999, I gather that this tendency keeps growing given filesharing and cd-burners, so I'm not quite sure how one would find much of the music on smaller regional labels today even from reputable importers.<br />This evolution aside and perhaps beyond RG's survey, this does whet your appetite for music. But be forewarned that much of it comes at quite a price from the net or a music store, if you're lucky enough to find what you want. The illustrations in the text, the sidebar profiles, the list of merchants appended: all these represent a labor of love and a fine reference source.<br />I do wish, finally, that RG had kept their guides on the Net (as it had at least with the Rock Guide in the later 1990s) so they could be updated as CDs go in and out of print.	2004-07-07

Many of the cross-references and entries reduce or eliminate the pre-1991 coverage in the 5th ed. This made room for what can be seen here, perhaps unwittingly, as the death of the alternative scene, as Option magazine folded since nobody knew what the adjective meant anymore. Stone Temple Pilots, Metallica, Madonna, Prince, Run-DMC are all here, which isn't a recommendation in my opinion. Still, faced with the lack of other works (Dave Thompson's Alt Rock guide and Christgau's decade-length digests are far more, well, individually weighted, for better or worse), this is the best in-print source. All-Music Guide, now having migrated like TP to the web, serves as an excellent counterpart to TPRG's 4th and 5th eds.<br />I often compare reviews from AMG and TPRG, or check data for references. Between the two, they fill a gap left by Rolling Stone since the 1980s and Spin since, well, then, for the American rock aficionado who can't always find Q or Mojo. TPRG started as an Anglophonic rock 'zine in the middle of the 70s, so its tendencies tilt that direction in much of its coverage. The styles remind me of the heyday of Option or Alternative Press in its array of critics, who often wrote in these magazines. The critics show their smarts and are fun to browse.<br />Reviewers do often go easier on the music than Thompson or Christgau, but their emphasis on what the more mainstream or over-eclectic critics miss fills the gaps for serious fans. If you use this in conjunction with AMG and your own gut reactions, you'll gain a better sense of what's worthwhile to keep hearing.	2004-07-07

His acidic attacks on his nation's complacency I always find stimulating and refreshing, if increasingly sounding like jeremiads rather than analyses. He, like many of us, finds lots wrong with an Ireland too eager to jump into bed with Anglo-American hegemony and multinational servitude, but is short on answers on how to stop the seduction.<br />This collection of essays brings, then, those Irish intellectuals who wag their fingers as well as clap their hands for their veteran friend, antagonist, and colleague. While it overlooks his European and republican contributions in favor of a more &quot;insular&quot; concentration, it does serve as the first volume, slim as it is, devoted to taking the man seriously.<br />Seeing that many of his works are out-of-print and often impossible to find even in good libraries, this festschrift should mark not the end of Fennell's four-and-counting decades in the public eye, but spark him and us to taking his jabs seriously, and putting them to work in today's Ireland. And, wherever sufferers of the &quot;postwestern condition&quot; languish.	2004-07-07

This book takes extremely obscure goth-industrial/new-wave curiosities even a rock geek like me's never heard of and mixes them into mini-essays that both overrate and dismiss, as any critic should do--according to his/her and our tastes, respectively!<br />Thompson did inspire me to go back and listen to bands fresh. Most of this book covers the 80s, especially the Brit scene, and while many of the records were impossible to find, or at least afford, back then, it does jog one's memory. As one fan's reactions, it straddles the fence between the Lester Bangs/Bob Christgau/Joe Carducci single-critic assaults and, in its catholicity, the variety of the Trouser Press or All-Music Guides.<br />You won't find exactly what you hoped for, but groups as bafflingly listed as Roogalator, pointless as Hanoi Rocks, and as risible as Dead or Alive share space with Gun Club, Raincoats, Buzzcocks and undoubtably your favorites too. I hope.<br />Added bonuses: the prefaces are windbagged attempts at giving backgrounds from the 1970s for the alternative scene. They read like they were cut-and-pasted from magazine articles. Better time spent perusing the discographies by label and producer, which appear unique to Thompson's compendium among current record guides.<br />And do read his reviews! Even if you've never heard of the music, they show his talent at summing up a sound and an attitude, with less snobbery than Christgau and more acumen than some in the Trouser Press volume (which doesn't overlap as much as you'd think with Thompson's picks.)<br />By the way, Thompson did publish in 2003 &quot;A User's Guide to the Fall,&quot; one of three Fall books that year.

This book, however, is for the latter category. As a refresher or a starter, this whets your appetite not by plunging you into the usual &#34;Dia dhuit&#34; conversation but a gradual grazing and nibbling about. Instead, the long history of this language--the oldest vernacular outside of Greek and Latin surviving in Europe--a look at male and female names, and the role of the language among tourists and in Ireland allows the reader to get a feel for the contexts within which today's learner will progress.<br /><br />Rosenstock, of German-Irish parentage by the way, is a noted poet, critic, editor and translator. His wit and enthusiasm make this an ideal starting-point for not only those who wish to learn Irish but those curious about how the language works, what its grammar and vocabulary look like, how simple conversations might go, and what its proverbs and colloquialisms reveal about the native Irish character.<br /><br />Rather than dive into another twenty-lesson textbook like Michael O Siadhail's admirable but daunting &#34;Learning Irish,&#34; my advice is to begin here, see if you like the language, and then go on to the more linguistically oriented tapes and series. (A later 2005 ed. has a CD.)<br /><br />This also accounts for the demotion of a star. Perhaps to appeal to the widest audience, almost no phonetic equivalents for the sounds of the Irish alphabet are given, since Scots, Aussies, ESL readers, and Americans might all say the sounds differently. Too often, Irish texts assume a learner with a standard English (as in the south-of-Britain version) dialect/accent. This avoidance, while admirable on one hand, detracts from a learner's &#34;ear,&#34; necessary for anybody needing to get a grasp of the peculiarities of Irish pronunciation. Still, you can read and get a feel for the layout and mentality of the language here and gain a valuable foundation upon which to later sound out...<br /><br />Adh m&oacute;r/good luck!in a valuable foundation upon which to later sound out...

With an English-speaking visitor and a native Czech guide, this takes you, chapter by chapter, chronologically through the eras that have built up and ripped down Prague. It's a bit hard to believe that this book has been co-authored by a native English speaker, as the idioms often smack of ESL: instead of being interrupted, she's always finding that he &quot;cuts across her.&quot; I must admit this only adds to the book's appeal. At the time just after the fall of the Wall, the city it describes may not be there just as it's here captured, but this heightens the allure of what's evoked, accounting for the rather &quot;enchanted&quot; air of much of the book. Simple but handsome drawings hint at what you'd see, and a welcome coverage of the area's often neglected ancient sites begin the itinerary promisingly.<br />Less dauntingly erudite than the study of its occult lore, &quot;Magic Prague,&quot; better digested than the history &quot;prague in Black and Gold,&quot; yet more detailed and relaxed than the typical guidebook, this combined narrative and handbook is recommended alongside the &quot;PragueWalks&quot; volume!

Patterson, born in the early 1960s in Belfast, has been ideally if fatefully placed for a vantage-point from which to explore his city's past decades, This debut novel, published when he was 27, has the hallmarks of such fiction: a protagonist's bildungsroman, the voice of a narrator that delves into his young character's inchoate mind in a manner beyond that character's means of expression, and a stress on violence and alienation that goes with this urbanizing territory.<br />This stands out most in my recall: the wasteland where Mal and his role model Francy play and square off: symbols of the larger divisions as summer brings explosions and battles. Patterson strips down the plot to detour from heavy-handed messages or naive journalistic appeals. As a native, he has the advantage of few of his competitors in this crowded corner of &quot;troubles&quot; fiction. He keeps it real. Less common among those who have tried to enter the northern Irish psyche, he looks out from the unionist side but feels no &quot;loyalism&quot; to all it represents. While his later novels roam about the city with less apparent duality and a subtler employment of symbol, for a beginner, Patterson here shows the talent he has sustained in Fat Lad, The International, and Number 5.	2004-07-07

His own Irish-German mixed background, explored in his memoir &quot;The Speckled People,&quot; enlivens each of the three novels. They are not related, but each tackles alienation within, in this case, Berlin around the fall of the Wall. It<br />begins with a literally headlong rush, and draws you into a tangle of relationships.<br />It feels as if based on real situations. This may testify to H's skill in inventing fiction out of his life, or his ability to make it seem so! Either way, without giving away too much of the plot, the Irish narrator must become a &quot;surrogate&quot; companion for a woman he falls for, who may or may not have been jilted by her lover. Interspersed with this plot, a Turkish-German woman widens the relevance of how &quot;outsiders&quot; in Germany can become accepted or remain at odds. Often, fiction that concentrates upon such intimate connections leaves me detached, but Hamilton keeps the narrator's development arc convincing while subtle.<br />His prose style, unassuming, uses transparency to allow you to gaze into the character's depths, and he handles the unfolding story well, given the limitations of the first-person that at times slow the action. After this, I would turn to his &quot;The Last Shot&quot; and &quot;The Love Test.&quot;	2004-07-06

Russians incinerated as they try to flee across the Volga. Mass cruelty mixed with a German clergyman painting a \\"Fortress Madonna\\" on the only available paper, the back of a military map. Soviet propagandists blaring \\"death tango\\" music across the front. The Russian truce seekers meeting with Germans after Christmas. Those on both sides who desert. Soviet POWs worked to death as human oxen. German letters home from the \\"kessel.\\" Hitler's gambling with half a million lives and Goebbels' media manipulation. Stalin's NKVD and Hitler's Feldgendarmerie both shooting those terrified to fight. Everywhere, mud, ice, blood.<br />These poignant and infuriating vignettes rise above the sheer mass of often primary-source material trawled by Beevor. Too often, this army formation goes here and this general goes there, especially in the middle of the narrative, and this weakens the \\"human\\" touch which I favor, although to be fair other readers may relish these strategic accounts. I certainly needed the maps to follow the action.<br />When I was a child, a \\"Reader's Digest\\" condensation described Stalingraders eating library paste and boiling leather goods to survive. Surprisingly, the civilian plight gains very little attention; the focus here mixes wide-scale accounts of troop movements with accounts drawn from letters and documents. This is a difficult balancing act to carry off for simplifying a complicated story over a couple of years in four hundred pages, and I commend Beevor's skill while wishing nonetheless that the book was even longer, to allow more space between these two extremes, and more time to relate the dazzling or dreadful individual's story that illuminates the fog of war.<br />A good companion to his \\"The Fall of Berlin,\\" and those curious about the punishment batallions of the Soviets, the effect of the loss of the Sixth Army on the Nazi psyche, and the fate of those receiving Russian revenge for Nazi terror will find a logical continuation in his more recent work.effect of the loss of the Sixth Army on the Nazi psyche, and the fate of those receiving Russian revenge for Nazi terror will find a logical continuation in his more recent work.	2004-07-06

Being a veteran of the mosh pit, I found the chapters on SST/Black Flag-Minutemen-Husker Du most relevant to my tour of duty in the early 80s. The latter chapters on such as Beat Happening, Mudhoney, and Fugazi barely registered. Burma and Sonic Youth have their moments; the Boston band's relative isolation gains impact when contrasted with the NY scenester's careerism. The 'Mats chapter skids to a halt without even a mention of \\"Tim\\" as if after indie labels the band ceased--inconsistently, the Huskers' saga continues after they jumped to Warner Bros. Similarly, SY gets more ink in the midst of their major-label dealings, as do the BH Surfers. The decade of hardcore and underground pre-Nirvana post-Brit/NYC punk/art/pose makes for a logical framework, but the fate of those surviving \\"Nevermind\\" and \\"the year that punk broke\\" [sic] would also make for sobering reading.<br />Steve Albini, the Minutemen, the Huskers, and Fugazi seem to come off best as principled artists here; the beginnings with indie labels like SST prove fascinating, and the conflict between ethics and long-term careers does make for tension within many of the bands' histories. I would've dropped the Surfers--whose antics more than any music had made them noticed--and combined Fugazi with Minor Threat. The K Records twee pop legacy, unfortunate as it is, seems not to fit into the whole, and Mudhoney's chapter seems taken from the author's two works on the Seattle grunge scene.<br />What should have been added? How Alternative Press and Option magazines worked with the smaller 'zines to educate and create savvy listeners, along with the indie and college radio stations, across the nation and abroad. Mail-order, in the pre-Net days, and good ol'word-of-mouth between fans at record stores, dorm rooms, garages, and gigs played as much as role as any other form of promotion these fledgling labels could create.<br />The decision, as with Option in the 80s, to only review lp's on indie labels ran into conflict as the majors used farm-league brands to nourish (and/or exploit) up-and-coming artists from regional areas. Concomitantly, this merge of the majors with the minors, and the distributors of British music here, is an neglected topic. IRS was an offshoot of WB, of course, as was Sire, but who can diminish their effect on college radio and local scenes despite or because of their added clout?<br />Joe Carducci (of SST) in his maddeningly Lester Bangs-ish \\"Rock and the Pop Narcotic\\" touches upon the role of labels and the whole mish-mash as hardcore dribbled into 70s metal and all sorts of (...)children spawned on those indie labels.

I read this after Michael Azerrad's &quot;Our Band Could Be Your Life,&quot; and Carducci's insider perspective plays off A's chapters on SST bands well. What chaps my hide is C's haughty inclusion of an LA Times article criticizing Black Flag's refusal to intervene when the moshers pounded on the innocent bystanders. C. acts as if the band had no responsibility for the brutality some of its fans perpetrated against other fans. C. thinks that the music matters not its context, and to me, as somebody who was there, that's b.s. The two are inseparable and you don't have to be a PC straight-edge Dischord disciple to agree. C's taking the easy, if provocatively punkish, way out here, just as gangsta rap's apologists do.<br />That out of the way, I do welcome any tome that celebrates both The Fall and Hawkwind, and his stream-of-consciousness rants on all sorts of po-mo critically reviled 70s music does mesh with what happened as SST devolved into a hair-metal crudge label! Where would Queens of the Stone Age, Velvet Revolver, and all that Seattle sludge have heard that it was ok to listen to Zep and Ozzy?<br />And, truth be told, Carducci's spot on when it comes to many of his ravings, even if Lester Bangs, Richard Meltzer, Chuck Eddy and Chuck Klosterman have all howled the same cry. Much as some of this book in its calculated slumming gets my goat, other chunks soothe my soul, and make me feel as superior as you do to what passes for street cred, as we get angrier and crustier compared to/about those darned kids. Heck, my sons now realize what a cool record collection their geek dad has, and passing along C. to them for expanding their horizons, where the unfashionable joins the unlistenable, continues to further the underground resistance, when real punks don't go to Hot Topic chain stores or don leather and mohawks to prove their commodified (non?)conformity. It's an attitude, as C. points out--not the puerile suburban tantrums that stifled so much creativity in the 80s, as his label's own slump then demonstrated irrefutably.ums that stifled so much creativity in the 80s, as his label's own slump then demonstrated irrefutably.	2004-07-06

It includes the first Hamilton fiction I read, \\"Nazi Christmas,\\" which in my opinion tries too hard to imitate Joyce's Dubliner mood, and the action of which is recycled to better effect in his memoir. If you've liked H's other books, however, the simplicity of these stories, with Irish and German locales, will widen your appreciation of his themes of exile, alienation, and longing.

For its poignancy and insight into what it must've been like as WW2 finally, but perhaps uncertainly, was ending, this novel brings that moment alive. Who fired the last shot and when serves as the hook for the reader, but I honestly felt this was rather anti-climactic when it's revealed. The strength here of Hamilton's skill lies less in the plot than in characterization and the establishment of mood as the Nazi remnants flee ahead of the Soviets from the Czech lands back into Germany. For those who like Hamilton's themes of German alienation and those caught between frontiers and national strife, this novel will please. Also look for a very hard-to-find counterpart novel of his set in the GDR, \\"The Love Test.\\" Both works, as with his better-known thrillers and his memoir, take on loneliness and fear with compassion and humanity.	2004-07-06

I read this after &quot;At the Tomb of the Inflatable Pig,&quot; John Gimlette's comparable Paraguayan travelogue, and both books feature young British who find themselves returning to a land they happened upon in their youth (circa early 1980s?) in decades since, contrasting the changes and recording that which endures. Thomson's account avoids Gimlette's overwritten prose, but its own lack of adornment may fail to keep all readers excited. He eschews New Age dippiness or &quot;us vs. them&quot; cute encounters for a more workaday narrative. He tells what he saw, who saw it earlier, and what we know about it--given the wide lack of hard evidence. He always relies on the locals, has an admirably nimble way with translating his excellent Spanish as he conveys his conversations with them, and avoids stereotypes on all sides--except for those ubiqitous German tourists we've all encountered ahead of the rest of us in the most remote places!<br />I wish he had invigorated his account a bit more with less recapitulation of his own often humdrum reactions, but he does this to counter the often romanticised visions of Hiram Bingham, Victor van Hagen, and many others who have explored the terrain before him--and not always as thoroughly as he has. The encounter with the titular White Rock, for example, is nearly subdued, but it sets off the mystery better than purple prose.	2004-07-04

Extremely well-written, conversational yet thoughtful, Davies and Lynch deserve congratulations for combining annotated bibliographies (including websites, which alas cannot keep up with print, as some are already vanished), glossaries, and chapters analysing the key elements of thinking. They rightfully (no pun intended!) distinguish fascism from far-right ideologies, and again remind us how often the former term becomes (like Nazi or holocaust) debased by lazy usage. This is the first book I'd recommend to anybody looking for more on the many permutations of this complicated system of thought, action, and myth.	2004-06-27

(By the way, he never explains what the &quot;Finn Sadal&quot; stands for in their name, but Fenian and &quot;sadall&quot;--Irish for animal or &quot;squat person&quot; seems apt!) He also over-estimates the power of the Church, and attributes to it a confused mixture of irrelevance and dominance. The whole papal subplot seems to veer off wildly and seems forgotten. The trek across Ireland slows the plot, and what all the quotes from fictional and real people have to do with the chapters gains no clarification. A recommended updating of the genetic code-meets-Irish terrorism angle is Henry Porter's novel &quot;Remembrance Day,&quot; about two decades later on the political and scientific front, if before the breaking of the genome.<br />Reading Herbert reminds me that so much of SF depends more on the excitement of ideas at the expense of satisfying characterisation. Too much of the story's wasted on superfluous people, names, descriptions, backgrounds which matter little. Prominently featured scientists trying to find the cure, for example, get attention early on but then are relegated to barely a mention; horrendously stereotypical &quot;stage Oirish&quot; dialogue by cardboard IRA men undercuts genuinely ambitious attempts by Herbert to analyse terrorist thinking. You get little sense of what &quot;ordinary&quot; folks suffered in the world of &quot;Panic Fires&quot; and mass barricades, or how goods (and weapons) would have been traded and daily life would have stumbled on. Many of the characters are too far removed in labs, the White House, the Papacy, and isolation to convey what the plague world would have felt like, and this detachment weakens the novel's force.<br />Like Michel Houellebecq's &quot;The Elementary Particles,&quot; a massive scientific restructuring of global society gains barely a nod until the end of the book, when far too much is crammed into a few pages. I felt like a sequel could have done more justice to the fascinating drama of a planet with 10,000 men to a woman.cientific restructuring of global society gains barely a nod until the end of the book, when far too much is crammed into a few pages.

But I wish it offered more of the human side: the gallows humor of the Berliners was a needed, if too sporadic reminder, of the day-to-day struggle we too often forget in a dehumanized enemy. A Soviet is quoted as being amazed that, faced with the loss of their parents amidst burning buildings, the German children cried just like their Russian counterparts had done. The Soviet is amazed at this similarity, after having been indoctrinated about the savagery of their enemy on every level and at every age.<br />The forest battles outside Berlin and the clash at the Seelow escarpment are the most vivid parts of this narrative. Beevor has done his homework, and has sprinkled into his military text of this general went here and this division came there the human accounts, but still, having finished Guy Sajer's &quot;The Forgotten Soldier&quot; (a French-German soldier on the Eastern Front, the end of which overlaps in the East Prussia campaign with Beevor's text), I missed more of the personal vividness of a memoir. I realize Beevor sets out to give an all-encompasssing account in a few hundred pages, and he does his job well, but I wish those he quotes so often, like Vasily Grossman for the Soviets, could be heard even more so. 11-13 million fled East Prussia, but even his research doesn't make their stories come alive enough, nor those of the Soviets who pursued the Germans into defeat.<br />One element emerges clearly, however: Stalin's ability to hoodwink the Allies, especially FDR, and devour Poland and what would become the GDR. It's amazing to think how gullible the U.S. was, played for fools by the &quot;liberating&quot; Soviet armies. For this, Beevor deserves full credit for his analyses.	2004-06-18

It's narrower than I expected: Britain barely gains a mention, but Latin America (e.g. Apristas in Peru) gains more attention, and Russia and Germany receive the lion's share of international coverage, balanced with the American fringes. It's unsurprising in its perspective, but having consolidated helpful documentation of Arab-Nazi/far-right ties, the hijinks of such as Yockey, Otto Ernst Remer, Skorzeny, and Gerhard Rex Lauch makes for unintentionally entertaining reading. I liked the vignette of Jewish tourists throwing bagels and lox at American Nazi Rockwell, and the delusions of the anti-ZOG megalomaniacs.<br />Too often, however, the book bogs down, especially in its post-war diplomatic accounts, in minutiae that had me nodding off. The condensation of the emergence of the French New Right, under Benoiste, and the permutations of the German thinkers, on the other hand, kept me page-turning. Certainly the descriptions of Yockey, for example, drawn I imagine from Kevin Coogan's bio in manuscript, showed Lee's ability to make his subject come alive.<br />Still, reflecting perhaps the rush to get this in print post-McVeigh, you get clumsy sentences like this (as early as the preface, xxvii): \\"With that fateful sub rosa embrace, the die was cast for a litany of antidemocratic CIA interventions.\\" Three metaphors mixed in 17 words. Or this non-sequitor. After citing evidence of neo-Nazi German views intersecting with \\"the perverse logic of ecofascism,\\" Lee then claims that $Qhis type of thinking would enable mainstream politicians to avoid racist terminology while advocating xenophobic views. 'We have to think of the ecological consequences of unlimited immigration.' declared Otto Zeitler, Bavaria's land development minister, after German unification.\\" (218)<br />Yes, certainly we have to think about such issues, but I see no xenophobia in pondering the obvious in Zeitler's statement. Routledge has published lots of fascist studies the past decade and a half; I recommend their very accessible and intelligently organized \\"Routledge Companion to Fascism and the Far Right\\" for an ideal introduction free of stereotypes or sloppy analyses. With Lee's book, the haste seems to emerge in the lapse in rigor.<br />The bias is evident in this book, but after having dutifully read it all, I find the purported threat from these factions in the West overblown, and those from the Middle East, on the other hand, largely ignored by the Left. It does gather in one volume a sobering reminder of how much the West, especially the U.S., cozied up to the remnants of the Nazi regime to keep them out of Stalin's grasp, and how much disinformation continues to be shelled out, by the Left and the Right, about the involvement between anti-communist factions, the far-right, and America.e to think about such issues, but I see no xenophobia in pondering the obvious in Zeitler's statement.

If you want to imagine yourself on the roads of mid-17c Ireland, under suspicion by its foreign and native lords, and managing to pursue the ladies, master the Gaelic tongue, and keep applying your Virgil to life's surprises, this is the novel for you. I commend Devaney's well-researched study, for this manages to show the clash of two mind-sets while keeping the plot boiling with all sorts of (mostly unrequited) love and action without cheapening the effect. I do wish it had not ended so suddenly; the fault of so many novels told in retrospect: the present rushes in and collapses into a frantic telescoping what had been carefully mapped out for so many detailed pages previously.<br />Still, I wish the author well, and I enjoyed a glimpse into the two cultures sparring against each other and the narrator caught between loyalties, even if his meeting with Bedell seemed anti-climactic after all of the tension built up throughout the plot.<br />If more comes from this writer's pen, it'll be worth the read.	2004-06-18

He knows so much that he writes this book with very few footnotes or quotations. But what's off the top of his head may go over yours: that is, he often throws out surnames of titles of parties and refers to movements and events that, for newcomers, need more context than he provides in the text. Sometimes, explanations are given later, frequently not.<br />The best portions are in the introduction--which shows how indefinable fascism is, in the lack of a Manifesto or a \\"Fascintern\\"--although much later, on p. 90, he gives a \\"fascist minimum.\\" Other bits are worthwhile--for me, the skinhead vs. fascist and far-right vs. fascism comparisons; the reminder that the term is overused and misunderstood by the Left; clerical fascism explained and its role in \\"political religion\\" in the misinterpretations known as radical Islam; why Soviets taught their people so little about the Nazis--too similar?; the megalomaniacal plans for world domination from Zhironovsky in early 90's Russia out of an Ian Fleming thriller or a Marvel Comics villain.<br />It taught me a lot, and as it anticipates the abuses of ideology across much of the world just before 9/11, remains relevant. Laqueur's study packs a lot into a few pages. It's just that he forgets that we all aren't as smart as he is. Probably better suited for those who know European politics already and want to delve deeper. It did show me that much of the threat in the West from the newer movements has been as overblown as perhaps that from the Middle East had been--at the time of writing in 1998--overlooked.	2004-06-07

In \\"CMTB,\\" the Charlie Manson-meets-Nikolai Gogol, Steppenwolf-Tarantino influences would have made for a decent novella, but nothing can sustain a reader faced with hundreds of pages of snippets from his briefly productive but ultimately solipsistic life. While a couple of the treatments he gives are engrossing on their own, and show how the hundreds of pages have been distilled into genuinely engrossing condensations, the effort expected of a reader to sift through so much dross to find the diamond is likely to discourage all but a McC fan who simply must read his every effort. This rivalled \\"The Dead School\\" for tedium, which is unfortunate given the dramatic potential of that and this book.<br />Even Ardal O'Hanlon's \\"Knick Knack Paddy Whack,\\"a first-time effort I found remaindered, offered as much fireworks. For a novelist of McCabe's proven abilities, \\"CMTB\\" is slacking off.<br />If, as the blurb tells us, it took five years to write, perhaps he should take ten per novel, like his fellow Border craftsman John McGahern. Nothing's shocking or compelling this go around.<br />Three examples: what was his rival Johnston's \\"Cyclops\\" thriller all about? Jimmy alludes to its contents in a sentence but given his jealousy towards his plagiarising mentor, why not elaborate? The stint in Mountjoy takes a few pages--whole years go by, with little from his incarceration to influence the rest of the novel, except to mark time, I suppose, and speed up the chronology. I found it curious that the narrative voice went into 3rd person briefly around pg. 296, and I hoped that--late in the game--this portended a fresh angle, but the end dribbles out into a series of dissipated conclusions, none of them that surprising given the unrelenting dreariness of the story.<br />Compared to noteworthy recent Irish fiction from the northern regions treating similar themes and situations--as disparate as John McGahern (By the Lake), Colin Bateman (Cycle of Violence and Divorcing Jack), Glenn Patterson (Burning Your Own and Number 5), Robert McLiam Wilson (Eureka Street and Ripley Bogle) and Niall Griffith (A Welsh version--in Sheepshagger), Mc Cabe's tale of inflatable dolls, IRA thugs, ennui, drugs, and autodidacts seems tired and exhausted.m that surprising given the unrelenting dreariness of the story. <br />Compared to noteworthy recent Irish fiction from the northern regions treating similar themes and situations--as disparate as John McGahern (By the Lake), Colin Bateman (Cycle of Violence and Divorcing Jack), Glenn Patterson (Burning Your Own and Number 5), Robert McLiam Wilson (Eureka Street and Ripley Bogle) and Niall Griffith (A Welsh version--in Sheepshagger), Mc Cabe's tale of inflatable dolls, IRA thugs, ennui, drugs, and autodidacts seems tired and exhausted.	2004-06-03

It did, but failed to rouse my ennui. Gimlette in small parts writes superbly. The blurb notes that while this is his first book, he has penned travel journalism. The latter, I think, is probably better suited to his style, which over hundreds of pages shimmers but then sinks. He has to integrate four hundred years of Paraguayan history into his own accounts of his decades of visits, and the book's weight slumps.<br />The best part, contrasting the Lengua natives and the German Mennonites on the Chaco, comes at the end; the previous 80% of the work spends far too long in Asuncion and whatever happens in the jungles gets bogged down in too many visits to ex-pats, too many boring meals at woebegone inns, and conversations that fail to interest anybody but the author himself.<br />I liked what I learned about Eliza Lynch, who is also the subject of two recent novels, and the devestating wars, the stronero regime of Stroessner, and the sheer mess that passes for daily life in much of the nation all make for naturally stimulating reading. But too often Gimlette strives for a word that doesn't quite fit--his three adjectival uses of &quot;curly&quot; for example--as he strains towards a style that calls more attention to himself than his subject.	2004-06-03

Eloquent desciptions of Budapest sustained about fifty pages, but what about the other couple hundred pages? Well, it's the same difficulty cubed here. This book's at least four times longer yet feels like ten times more cleverly engrossed in navel-gazing. Here, as the blurb tells you, he takes on the whole noble family from which he's descended. The first half, mixing up all of his ancestors as his father and his mother, could've been jettisoned completely. The first interesting scene came on page 449: between his grandfather and a Bela Kun-era communist functionary dismissing the grandfather's shrine to his brother as &quot;nothing,&quot; brushing away in the name of bureaucracy all that was individual.<br />Still, for a more consistent version of this, read Ken Kalfus' recent novel The Commissariat of Enlightenment. I kept waiting for truly engrossing insights into the clash of ideology and the personal, but too few remained in the last half of the book, although to be fair it reads more easily than the first half.<br />Bits do glitter within a heap of fools' gold. The narrator's lunch treats made by his mom. Mr. Nussbaum's visit, a showdown with an officious waiter, a household raid by Soviet troops, the memory of an afternoon with uncle Roberto, the realization that a dictatorship equals intimidation and fear, with its executioners and victims on the sidelines. I chuckled when his family were labeled the lowest category&quot;intellectuals plus class enemies. But moments like these are far too few. As the title line of my review indicates, this book should've been 150 pages.<br />Far too little of Hungary emerges in a distinctive manner. I'd check out Tibor Fischer's Under the Frog for a more powerful and 75% shorter narrative of the Stalinist period. Strange that Esterhazy's homeland sags so stultifyingly on these pages when they boast of having owned so much of it. Almost none of its beauty or limitlessness rises from these word-soaked chapters, upon which no editor's red pen seems to have alighted. The translation by Judith Sollosy--the dustjacket notes she's an espert in translation and head of the Hungarian publisher Corvina's English section--gives us at one point a Pope &quot;Pious&quot; (no pun, as much later we read &quot;Pius,&quot;) and renders from Magyar what we read as a &quot;bum wrap&quot;--a great neologism, but not what the author meant, in context!<br />Finally, the borrowings from dozens of other writers make for--in theory--a great instance of interextuality. I added one star for effort. But this magpie approach--for example, lifting parts of Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes to bring the death of a twin brother of the narrator into the plot--dumbfounded me. If you want an intelligent longer read you're better going back to one of Esterhazy's inspirations, like The Magic Mountain, Ulysses, or even Beckett's 1950s three novels. These deliver modernism in its concentrated form. What Esterhazy delivers is diluted, bloated, and indigestible. Maybe the compressed nature of the Magyar original does justice to Esterhazy's overwhelming lists, musings, anecdotes, and endless random thoughts, but the English version left me exhausted and glad to be done with the task.owned so much of it.

In the first five chapters offer a succint history of the city. I found especially valuable &quot;the Moving World,&quot; on the various accounts available to English-speakers from those who had endured the 20c in this city. Also consult George Cushing's Hungarian section from James Naughton's Traveller's Literary Companion to Central and Eatern Europe. Like Jacobs' book, out of print but still able to be found secondhand.<br />Jacobs' guided walks (with simple maps) sometimes cover lots of ground, literally and theoretically, but fill a lack for Budapest, a city which--unlike Prague-lacks many quality guidebooks and suggested itinaries for English-speaking visitors, armchair and real.  His reading list's well-chosen, and his mixing of personal and historical narrative proves easy to read and packs a lot of thought into a couple hundred pages.	2004-04-29

It makes you see the West from the Celtic perspective, with an almost &quot;what if?&quot; tone. The remainder focuses upon the author's attempts to rebuild from what we know of the historical record, folkloric practice, and modern re-creation what can be taken from the past and made relevant for modern seekers of Celtic wisdom, morality, and spirituality.<br />As with Caitlin Matthews' daily handbook of prayer and ritual, &quot;Celtic Devotional,&quot; this book responds to a need for a less romanticized, more practically oriented approach to a way of living that concentrates upon one's interpersonal relations as well as one's orientation with the natural and supernatural realms. I applaud the author's insistence that Celtic languages be a part of the revival process within the learner. His own struggles to reimagine and reinvigorate ancient learning and mix it into ethical practice deserve wide attention and I commend this book to any of you curious to get beyond &quot;new age&quot; facades and delve into a truer, and less superficial, way to understanding. It's not always a quick read, but better taken in smaller amounts, to be pondered and integrated, before continuing. It's a book probably also best read with others and talked about--I wish I could've known people I could've shared it with! While Caitlin Matthews' devotional suits the solo reader, this book benefits from a group, preferably led by one more adept than first-time seekers, at least from my impressions.<br />This book exists as &quot;The Apple Branch&quot; and as &quot;Celtic Wisdom,&quot; but it's the same contents. Not easy to find, but, fittingly, worth the quest. as is much beyond our impulsively mall-bound, chain-store, one-click grasp!	2004-03-23

The protagonist reminds me of a younger version of Garda (policeman) Paddy Coyne in Hugo Hamilton's Dublin novels, \\"Headbanger\\" and \\"Sad Bastard,\\" in its conveyance of contemporary Irish attitudes and language. Sorry, it ain't Barry Fitzgerald for those taken aback at such youthful invective.<br />This could've been a much better long-short story, or a novella. Much of the writing is too casual, even coming from its post-adolescent characters, and I guess the lucrative (!) nature of putting out a novel rather than a story adds to the padded feel of the plot and descriptions. Francesca's story does have, however, a different attitude and diction that works well to balance off of Patrick's, and the shifts add to the appeal the novel does manage to sustain.<br />It's slow going for the first 40% of the book, and it only picks up nearing the finish.

True to the Hibernian stereotype, he talks your ear off for hours yet you come away dazzled by his wit...only realizing after your &quot;intimate&quot; conversation how little you've actually learned from your nimbly eloquent and now fleeting acquaintance.<br />I found his opening two chapters on Irish Catholicism the best, in which he balances fault-finding with sensitivity and compassion. His chapters on far-left politics and &quot;losers&quot; reveal not so much his own intellectual and political thoughts as his take on the wider community of thinkers, posers, and activists in all their idealism and philistinism both.<br />His mentor at Oxford proves in his student's eyes repelling and appealing, but the whole dislocation I presume Eagleton felt at Oxford here becomes refracted into some Wildean scene that, not having had the privileges Eagleton earned, I could not fully share. His recollections on the page seemed angled at those within the charmed circle, as those in the leftist campaigning, and if you're removed at a distance as I am, the detachment only grew as I read his entertaining but--in these latter sections--ultimately disengaged recollections.<br />Still, as with his literary and satirical work (seek out his novella &quot;Saints and Sinners&quot;), Eagleton's worth reading, for the energy of his mind and the enthusiasm of his intellect. You won't find much about his personal side here, but he does deliver what he wishes to share on the page, frankly and tersely.	2003-09-25

You see through this densely described but thinly plotted series of vignettes life as a small boy regaling you with peasant and small-town stories before the onset of WW2 brings that relative idyll to a close. In one of the strongest sections, the fury of civil war that brings the Nazis, the Soviets, partisans, and communist activists like the narrator into a tremendously violent clash. Like the hero of the book and film \\"Europa, Europa,\\" the speaker here also must keep switching allegiances as the borders constantly shift and Hungary's caught between the warring powers.<br />Later, the collapse of bourgeoisie democracy at the machinations of the communists receives a well-described treatment; without some prior knowledge of who some of those only identified by initials here might be in real-life postwar Hungary, however, the effectiveness of this section weakens for Western readers. (Some note or appendix by the translator would've helped.)<br />The travails of the narrator in prison also become gripping as the Party seeks to tighten its grip on even and especially its own members, in the name of permanent vigilance and the necessity to continually finds scapegoats for the \\"people\\" to blame. The 1956 revolt receives a mixed review here, surprising to many weaned on more of a heroic, James Michener rendering.<br />More prison, more mental hospital (the monologue of the sanitarium director to the narrator on his hospital discharge is priceless), and more pages devoted to the plight of the somewhat pampered intellectual in the service of being a predictable dissident to the West and privileged servant of the East: these concerns take up much of the remainder of the story, along with a substantial amount of spontaneous and/or furtive sex, which seems pro forma for these types of novels (see Klima and Kundera for comparison). The problem, as with Konrad's later \\"A Feast in the Garden,\\" is that little of the writer's energy seems directed towards creating art rather than commentary. Perhaps the changed circumstances within which Konrad would've labored as a writer under the communist regime to produce this work pertain, but for Western readers, it's not a gripping storyline. You'd benefit from it more for what it conjures up about life under attempted and actual totalitarianism than for a fluid and inventive array of characters, settings, or symbols.<br />A final note: A mincos (the Hungarian title) means more a \\"go-between\\" or a \\"panderer\\" rather than \\"loser.\\" The distinction clarifies the situation often found by a narrator who winds up neither Jew nor Gentile, Communist nor anti-Communist, freed from confinement nor imprisoned behind walls.

He favors thinking about Kafka, Kampuchea, the Bomb, garbage, and corrosion of the moral and physical type. It takes a very slow accretion of these reflections, alternating with the narrator's work on a sanitation crew, the decline of his father's health, his marriage and his mistress, and his own impotence as--you guessed it, a writer..to emerge into what manages to be an appropriate ending to this reflective, meditative narrative.<br />I like Klima's refusal to give into the cliche, the accepted role, and his determination to peer over into the abyss: the quality he fears and admires in his predecessor Kafka. As with most of his work, you find out less about the streets of Prague than his inner labyrinthine intellect. I do wish, however, that Klima could break out of his familiar narratorial role: his protagonist always seems like himself, despite at the novel's start a disclaimer. Which is wise, considering Klima's faithful rendition of a love triangle that motivates what plot that exists to thread the multiple digressions and sub-plots along. His account of infidelity certainly carries the whole theme of lies and decay forward and grounds the novel in its elaborations.<br />Actually, the garbage crew proves the least interesting part of this novel, and the relationship between him and his wife and his mistress the most engrossing--I expected to be excited by just the opposite motif! Klima comments elsewhere that he took on the garbageman job as &quot;research&quot; for a novel. On the other hand, under the communist regime, he may not have had many alternatives. See &quot;My Golden Trades&quot; for some of his other tasks.<br />More admirable than Kundera, in my opinion, is Klima's moral stance; you can read his interview with Philip Roth in Klima's essay collection &quot;Spirit of Prague&quot; to understand more about how the two Czechs differ in their decisions. For readers willing to be moved more by insight than titillation, this is a fine place to begin your introduction to Klima's world.he two Czechs differ in their decisions.

US	53087372	RQJ275Y0OY0NT	0964561123	785895107	The Spirit of Prague and Other Essays	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Aphoristic, probing, and mostly satisfying	Like Klima's fiction, this collection reveals his characteristic ruminative style as he ponders his and his nation's pasts, his mission to write to express his yearnings, and his thoughts on salt, garbage, totalitarianism, language, and Kafka. Surprisingly, I found the concluding essay on his famous predecessor rather mundane in its insights compared to his more focused thinking about how a writer must find himself true to himself rather than an ideology--this theme connects many of the essays. There's repetition of even some of the same phrases and motifs from overlapping essays and his fiction, but this makes for a more coherent, if less dazzling, overview of his mental landscape. For, despite the title, most of the essays dig inward rather than expand outward into Czech views. Klima's passion makes him--and you--delve within the human spirit to investigate how it endures pre- and post-1989 reality--in the Nazi camp at Terezin, under the rule of fascism and communism, and in the uneasy transfer to uncertain capitalism: Klima observes them all.<br />His shorter, more casual pieces remind me of Karel Capek's in their humanism and attention to the everyday's intersection with the infinite. While they feel less weighty, they still help to widen your perspective on the often elusive, unreal qualities of the harsh world within which Klima has had to hack out his own hardwon wisdom, to keep going as a creative artist despite camps, jails, and decades of forced manual labor and samzidat, clandestine survival as a writer who refused to give in.<br />None of the essays, besides, feel dated. His interview with Philip Roth proves fascinating, and the title piece serves as essential reading for any visitor, armchair or actual, to his native city. If you've read Klima's novels or stories first, you'll recognize many familiar concerns. The concentration of his thoughts here, as opposed to their more leisurely inclusion as they drift in and out of his (often nearly identical to their author, it seems to me) protagonists, makes an appropriate guide to Klima's world view. Paul Wilson's translations live up to his usual fluency. An annotated bibliography by Wilson of Klima's publications, or a preface that aimed at showing Western readers more of the scope of his fiction, plays, and non-fiction would have improved this volume, for Klima makes passing references to what he's working on at the time. Without more knowledge of his ouevre, however, it's hard for a newcomer to relate the particular essay to the other writing that had engaged him at the time.<br />For all its circling around the same concerns, for better and worse, Klima does manage by repetition to remain stubbornly faithful to his vocation: to combine the human wish to seize the day with the realization that the days pass and soon no more will we able to seize time at all. His refusal to ignore mortality makes for rather uncomfortable but ultimately honest reading. This serves as a portal into Klima's interior realm.heir author, it seems to me) protagonists, makes an appropriate guide to Klima's world view.

Why Konrad bothers to invent \\"David Kobra\\" to provide the author's seemingly randomly connected reflections when it's evident that they are Konrad's own life, more or less, strains the limits of what we expect from a previously capable writer. Wartime descriptions and subsequent reports from Hungarian recent history as witnessed first-hand enliven parts of this novel, but too much attention to extraneous affairs of the heart and the head drag down any momentum gained by this novel's livelier moments. This work sorely needed a tough editor.<br />I would have accepted either an tighter autobiography or an energized novel, but not this rambling narrative, lazily assembled and languidly paced with little regard for sustaining any reader's interest but the author's own for his story. Disappointing, given the inherent interest of much of the material of a life spanning the past half-century and more in Hungary.<br />An English-language reader curious about this period would better find \\"The Undefeated\\" by Palocsi or \\"My Happy Days in Hell\\" by Faludy as first-person testimonies of life lived under such turmoil as Stalinism, or novels like Konrad's earlier \\"The Loser\\" for communism, Fischer's \\"Under the Frog\\" for the 1956 revolution or \\"Fateless\\" by Kertesz for the Nazi camps suitable for more gripping stories.	2003-09-05

It's simply that a lot of the pieces here gathered seem lackluster (the detective tales, the vignettes, a good chunk of the plays) and may not have weathered well the shifts in literary taste since WW2. The decline in tension in RUR from its strong beginning to a too-romantic fadeaway surprised me; I expected a harder-hitting plot. Still, worth a read for anyone curious about the robot vs. human conflict at its birth. The next play, the Makropoulos Secret, only gathers steam near its conclusion, in the whole rationale for immortality. Capek's genius to me appears erratic and while powerful in certain speeches given his theatrical characters, dissipates over the course of these two plays taken as a whole.<br />As for the stories, the two versions of the single footprint mystery deserve attention, and the \\"money\\" story, although contrived, makes an effective point. The more investigative tales doubtless will appeal to fans of the detective genre, but they didn't do much for me. The feuilletons anthologized here make for pleasant reading, continuing a French/Czech specialty, but really aren't meant to be earthshattering in their simply observed reflections. As a journalist, Capek shows both the immediacy and the impermanence common to much of this genre.<br />The shorter pieces included rarely roused my interest; exceptions, however, made my reading worth it. Two superb considerations of how the bakers felt about Jesus' miracles of the loaves and the fishes and (especially) Pilate's reflections on his famous query \\"What is truth?\\" show off Capek's skills very effectively.<br />Also, the reflections in the last quarter of the book, on Czechoslovakia (just before the Nazi invasion) as the center of Europe, on what's truly revolutionary as centered more in the transformation of the individual by gradual change rather than sudden political overthrow, and a brief essay that shows the plight of the urban poor rival Orwell in their combination of the perspective of the little man with the insight of the intellectual.the urban poor rival Orwell in their combination of the perspective of the little man with the insight of the intellectual.	2003-09-05

This book would please fans of Kundera--the exploration of the aesthetic--and Klima--the examination of the moral. It conveys in hazy, introspective short chapters various scenes from the exterior and interior landscapes of the narrator over the postwar period. The 1947-67 focus allows Klimant to delve into the problems of society and how the individual can align an artistic or ethical impulse with the oppressive surroundings he, in this case as an architect, must design.<br />Questions of art, as his companion Olga and he discuss, make for the most engaging part of this work. I found that, once the first seventy pages had passed and the narrator's retrospective exposition had circled back to the 1967 &quot;present,&quot; that the flow lost its control and the novel began to dissolve into smaller, less involving scenes. The structure seems to fit more an interconnected group of short stories than a conventional novel.<br />Robert Wechsler's translation notes make clear the difficulties in rendering this elusive text into English, and perhaps some of my comments reflect this distancing effect on a foreign reader. Still, for those who love dense prose more than a gripping plot, this novel should reward those who have read other, more popular Czech authors and who wish for more glimpses into the subtle struggles of a sensitive narrator during the communist tyranny.	2003-09-04

In a few pages about a Skoda car dealer, for example, he tells you much more about post-communist economics, Czech character, and the slippery negotiations needed as an Eastern bloc society adapts the mannerisms of the West. As a returned emigre, he's in the ideal position to contrast his decades in Chicago with his decades in a provincial town in the Czech republic. His bilingual skills allow him to be a stealth Czech--his attitude has become American, but his mother tongue lets him &quot;spy&quot; on how his compatriots &quot;really&quot; act out of earshot of tourists.<br />While I would have liked more on how his wife (also Czech-born) fared with him on his year in Prague, or how he worked with Milos Forman on the director's &quot;auto&quot;biography, this book does capture fluidly in two hundred easy-to-read pages what denser tomes and more superficial visitor's accounts labor to convey.<br />Two examples from the book: &quot;In writing this book, I took heart from the fact that memory itself is a kind of an imagination.&quot; That is, Novak in short chapters within the book, and then briefer vignettes, in a mosaic fashion pieces together his impressions of his own hometown, his friends, his stay in Prague, and his encounters on a daily basis to build up undramatically the shifts in his own life and that of his homeland. Unassuming, Novak gives a personal perspective without getting wrapped up in his own self-importance.<br />After a failed interview with the Prague-based outpost of Reader's Digest, Novak reflects: &quot;the Number One Print Publication in the Free World banged on the Bell of Liberty out front while peeping through the keyhole out back, and maybe what it finally boiled down to was this: in the West, people often weren't what they said they were, while in the post-Communist East, in a more forgivable and tragic way, people often weren't what they thought they were.&quot;<br />Novak's own humility and Everyman stance shows here, as well as his rather annoying tendency to Capitalize Important Archetypes or Stereotypes to Make a Point. He does this throughout the text to draw together many of his disparate themes, and his ablility to do this succeeds in small portions (he gives a great chapter on Prague's legendary past) but this distracts over the course of the book.<br />My only other caveat: this will teach you little (except for that chapter) about Prague itself; it's more a study of the current (as of 1992) Czech psyche as found mostly in Prague than a tour through the nation or an introduction to recent history or culture. Best read for those who have a grounding in the context already, and who wish to delve deeper than guidebooks or visitor's impressions.e.&quot; <br />Novak's own humility and Everyman stance shows here, as well as his rather annoying tendency to Capitalize Important Archetypes or Stereotypes to Make a Point.

I recommend his novel \\"City Sister Silver.\\" In Joycean, demotic, slangy, and debased registers, he manages in his story excerpted here to capture post-1989 Prague while avoiding the imitative Kafkaesque allegory that clogs so much of his earlier, pre-Glasnost compatriots' stories in this volume. Klima's \\"Tuesday Morning: A Sentimental Tale\\" from his superb \\"My Merry Mornings\\" collection and Skvorecky's droll \\"The Well-Screened Lizette\\" both highlight the intricacies of love and sexual politics in the Communist era. Ladislav Fuks' \\"Kchony Sees the World\\" and Arnost Lustig's \\"The River Where the Milky Way Flows\\" strive to examine the Shoah from an adolescent's oblique viewpoint; Ewald Muller's brief nightmare \\"Swallowed by Earth\\" in turn conveys the mood of partisans and refugees during the war forcefully. Ota Pavel's \\"Cafe Slavia\\" excerpt and Berkova's \\"Lousehead\\" excerpt manage less successfully but still ambitiously to capture some of the manic air of Stalinism and hero worship.<br />The other selections make me wonder if editors feel compelled to include all of their long-neglected authorial friends in these anthologies. When so many writers have admittedly suffered under totalitarianism and have been limited to samizdat clandestine exposure for decades, it sounds mean to begrudge them a wider audience. And many may not have had the luxury of being enriched by what Western readers could for forty years of the post-WW2 years. I don't mean to patronize, but the rest of the volume does not stand up to the selections I've noted. Topol's novel that followed this anthology, however, confirms him as the first major post-1989 figure in Czech fiction, and I hope that others will follow his formidable but dazzling path soon.	2003-08-30

Not that all of it happened to Pekarkova, but this reads often best for its descriptions of refugee camp squalor, the hearsay of Olda and the camp inmates who bicker over \\"urban legends\\" filtered rather poorly from abroad about Canada, Australia, and the U.S., and the needs for sex and comfort while waiting out so many lonely nights in an uncertain limbo between East and West in the early 1990s. As fiction, as opposed to reminiscence, I suppose the sexual quotient gets amplified and the violence magnified for the plot, but it's pretty much a slow read despite the frequent couplings, fights, and constant bickering that she narrates well but ultimately wearyingly to us. In smaller portions, the power of her tale and the evident joy Pekarkova shows in crafting her story comes through, but this novel fails to truly sustain its 200 pages, and probably could have better succeeded as a trio of interlinked short stories. So much seems padded in terms of camp life, while the interludes in Italy and outside the camp could have benefitted from far more detail and incident. While I can reckon that as a novelist, she wanted to highlight the camp as opposed to the outside world, the hermetic<br />emphasis on an unendingly mundane routine slows the pace down to entropy. True, you feel you're in the camp too, but this may not be the best place to propel a novel, rather than an anecdote.<br />Still, given her delight in storytelling, and her often carefully organised observations--especially early in the narrative in her Czech homeland--I look forward to more mature work from this promising writer, who here gives much detail about a realm in which millions have lived over the past half-century but (as opposed to the Nazi and Stalinist camps) almost none have conveyed to Western audiences in English. (By the way, the translation's very fluid, as if the novel was written in English, and the book's slow-moving but quite readable.)e.)	2003-08-30

The Publisher's Weekly blurb sums up the strengths and weaknesses of this ambitious but ultimately lackluster narrative. The research conveyed here admirably impels you to keep going, but about a third of the way into the story, the initial pace flagged (after the first attempted uprising) and the subsequent characters and events did not captivate me. I kept reading dutifully; the spark that animated the tension between interrogating brooding scribe Coote and his unbelievably eloquent prisoner Cot dwindled into endless testimony rather than crafted tale-telling. It defies a reader's credulity that a girl with minimal education, in spite of her Daly bardic heritage and that oul' gift of the gab could fashion such a tale down to artfully rendered verbatim conversations, vocabulary, and allusions and details so long after the &quot;fact&quot;. McCafferty wisely intersperses Coote's own impatient and rather scoffing reactions to Cot's volubility to balance her testimony, but by the end of two hundred pages of such a lopsided conversation, the narrator's own power has long dwindled before the relentless drone of dreary incident and irrelevant digressions. Perhaps this is meant to reflect &quot;real&quot; slave narratives, but this does not make for the most engrossing fiction.<br />If McCafferty wants us to imagine that this is a testimony in the line of slave and captivity narratives, this imitation would work well in a classroom study of such texts. With an author's preface and afterword, footnotes, reader's guide, and a glossary, this apparatus only furthers such a use. I liked the attempt to add an Islamic spin to the later sections of the tale, but this never became as fascinating a motif as it could have been within the larger framework.<br />Many students (and teachers) could benefit from exposure to the little-known &quot;redshanks'&quot; fate in the colonization of he New World. As a college instructor myself who researches Irish themes, this work by a lecturer does appear created for such an audience for comparison to &quot;real&quot; narratives of servitude. But, outside of a syllabus' assignment, I cannot imagine many readers will finish this without, well, being impelled to do so by their own duty to their Authority.<br />(For later black-Irish American themes, Peter Quinn's &quot;Banished Children of Eve&quot; and Kevin Baker's &quot;Paradise Alley&quot; both treat the middle-19c in NYC, immigrants and mixed-race unions, free-born and ex-slaves, and the Draft Riots--the latter re-created in the film &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;.)r does appear created for such an audience for comparison to &quot;real&quot; narratives of servitude.

In the first half of this memoir, she avoids the overly and sadly familiar vignettes of camp inmates to instead explore in detail the unfamiliar story of what happens to an escapee from the death camp who wanders back to Prague, while the Nazis still rule the city.<br />Her scenes of homelessness and fear, as her former friends often become terrified at seeing her alive and sheltering her from the Germans, reveal a fresh persective on a refugee who ironically seems to be more endangered outside Auschwitz than if she had stayed within the lager. After the war, she shows how the Jews returning to their homes found their possessions and livelihoods stolen, and how many of their fellow Czechs had brazenly or surreptitiously commandeered the houses and the property for themselves, since the Jews could do little to regain these items.<br />Kovaly then explains how the appeal to a more just system, rather than the beleaguered democracy that tried to revive postwar Czechoslovakia, began to fool idealistic Czechs into supporting a communism based more on the lies of those who dared not tell the truth of Stalinism, as well as those who genuinely sought--as her first husband Rudolf Margolius--to bring about a better world through Marxism on more of a Titoist model.<br />Many pages that follow could serve as a primer for exposing how communist dreams began to replace harsh reality for many Czechs. In incisive prose, with well-chosen metaphors and vignettes, she excels in comparing her own search to that of her husband and his fellow believers. This gradual conversion, she finds, could not be based on the facts, since these were hidden from the \\"masses,\\" but doomed the Czechs to repeat the failures of Soviets, who pretended that no prejudice or nationalism tarnished the record of their CCCP--an inspiration for Czechs weakened by the Nazis, the camps, and only two decades of fragile post-WWI uneasy peace under an attempt at humane democracy. Their self-confidence beaten down, they were ripe for the idealism and self-sacrifice that communism promised.<br />Also, she notes, the servile, the opportunists, and the conniving rose quickly in a system that rewarded the disciple, often an incompetent member of the \\"proletariat\\" over qualified managers and leaders. She shows in the next quarter of the book how her husband was forced to become a foreign minister, and how quickly the climate shifted and led to his show (Slansky) trial and execution. Then, the pace shifts for the last section into a quick leap forward to 1968, and evocative descriptions of the \\"Prague Spring\\" and her eventual flight to the West at last.<br />Readers who select Ivan Klima's novels of Czech life before and after communist dictatorship, Sandor Marai's \\"Memoir of Hungary, 1944-48,\\" or Gyorgy Faludy's account of prison in Stalin-era Hungary \\"My Happy Days in Hell\\" will appreciate this memoir.<br />P.S.

Klima could have written a novel about a figure like him rather than a dissident disillusioned for a change. Like his other novels, here Klima carefully constructs a story in which the plot alone will not carry you along. The film that the narrator imagines out of his everyday reality makes for an intriguing contrast between art and real life, but this sort of story within a story by an artist by now has lost its originality. Where Klima best succeeds is in examining how people compromise themselves to survive an otherwise intolerable situation, and his works deserve attention for their honesty.<br />Not a lot happens--the soporific tone may mirror the grey nature of the state of which Klima writes; little of it comes alive save a few glimpses of nature. I suppose that's the point, but it makes for slow going. I like the epigrams tossed about the text, but this feature of Klima's style jars you a bit, since his tales constantly shift between meditations on powerlessness and resistance to totalitarianism and a conventional story in which not much happens to a dithering narrator, recognizably human to be sure but never particularly loveable. I'd start with his shorter stories before tackling this rambling novel.	2003-08-19

A few points that have not received much comment elsewhere here on amazon.com.<br />Pros: Marvelous scenes: Mark's obsessive study of cafe culture and his determination in an afternoon of \\"funicularation\\" [my coinage!] to distill the essential five unforgettable seconds to cherish always from this effort. Nicky's depictions of the \\"half\\" verses within the biblical tales portraying characters' doubts and second-guesses, and her catfight with Emily over John. Scott's brush-off when John shows up uninvited at his flat during his \\"date\\" with Maria, and his offhandedly cruel reversals of childhood cruelties onto his brother. The whole second section on Imre Horvath and the business course final exam to compress within a few pages the choices faced by Imre. The restaurant meal seen through the omniscient narrator now vs. the memories of the older generation then. Melchior's sudden entry into the tent at another eatery. ESL students' phrasing. Finally, the attempt to resist cliche while living it.<br />Cons: The disappearance or slide off-stage in the last half of the book of key characters. Narrative fatigue evident in the increasingly slack authorial voice as the plot trundles forwared. Harvey's taking a supporting role in the story despite little earlier attention to a seemingly insignificant figure for satire; the inclusion of Imre's two daughters seems to hint at their role in the latter part of the novel but this never develops despite the set-up; a loss of momentum perhaps meant to mirror the growing ennui of other key characters in the novel.<br />While such a state of sloth may better reflect reality as Phillips and his fictional counterparts endured in Budapest, for a novel I'd expect a tighter revision of life into art. John's Don Juanish rake's progress through the ladies of the city became more and more unbelievable given his sad-sack condition, or unless this reflects the less-discriminating standards of newly liberated youth for impecunious Western journalists. Wish-fulfillment?<br />In fairness, the strength of the novel rests in its clash between old and new, Hungarian and American, and although the book could've been a hundred pages less, it does convey the flavor of the physical city and mental condition of (some of) its inhabitants--as of a decade or more ago.

Like the Cambridge Companion to Joseph Conrad (and unlike much within the Companions to Joyce or Beckett, for instance), this volume in the series guides both newcomer and veteran reader of an author whose symbolic, portentous themes may discourage first-timers.<br />The editor clearly introduces Kafka within his wider European context; David Constantine shows how we can read Kafka more open-endedly as opposed to the straightjacketed interpretations of scholars, and emphasizes a recurrent theme: K's search for truth demonstrates how his work must slip out of any closed meaning anyone can attempt to lasso around a slippery critter like Kafka.<br />Anne Fuchs tries, anyway, with a psychoanalytic take on \\"The Man Who Disappeared\\" [aka \\"Amerika\\"]; Rolf Goebel's exploration of the flaneur in the modern city of The Trial (I too prefer German connotations of the \\"Process\\" better as its title) works better to show off an element overlooked to many for a fresher interpretation than Fuchs' for her chosen text. Elizabeth Boa's examination of matriarchal household vs. patriarchal \\"Castle\\" provides a convincing look at Heimat, myth, and quest in that novel; Ruth Gross inevitably must cram too much in too little space for her dash past the short fiction, but her focus on the divided self of Kafka who must write to survive despite a job shows an author many of us can understand as truly one of us.<br />Stanley Corngold (whose translation of the Metamorphosis should be studied by all readers to compare against the Muirs' version)<br />offers a complex examination of the metaphysical division in the later prose and aphorisms; Bill Dodd revives the political aspects of Kafka to counterbalance the common religious-mystical readings, and places Kafka within the nationalist, Zionist, labor, and technological issues of his time, usefully reminding us of his occupation in the new field of worker's accident insurance and the clashes between the company's interests and those of the everyday claimant.<br />Iris Bruce for Jewish folkloric elements and Dagmar Lorenz for gender issues both explain well the relevance of these themes in accessible essays; Anthony Northey's examination of biographical myths vs. realities usefully suggests to non-specialists how we should revise the ideas that Kafka was some working man's crusader within the limits of his job, and how the Castle's women illuminate the place of the real women in K's life.<br />Osman Durrani's chapter on editions, translations, [stage] adaptations compresses fascinating issues arising from these three elements; Helen Hughes and Martin Brady's Kafka and film adaptations, however, suffers from its self-consciously clever style at the expense of detailed analysis (Welles' \\"The Trial\\" gets the best critique, but deserves more in-depth treatment); Iris Bruce's chapter on Kafka and popular culture likewise gives far too little detail and focus mainly on \\"The Fly\\" and \\"Naked Lunch\\"-type homages while barely noticing, say, the whole effect of K. on the tourist industry in Prague or the impact on a wider audience beyond these two movies and a R. Crumb comic biography.<br />All in all, worth a read; the jargon of these specialists should not detract from the insights which open up new depths for readers outside the classroom and the seminar as well.ithin the nationalist, Zionist, labor, and technological issues of his time, usefully reminding us of his occupation in the new field of worker's accident insurance and the clashes between the company's interests and those of the everyday claimant.<br />Iris Bruce for Jewish folkloric elements and Dagmar Lorenz for gender issues both explain well the relevance of these themes in accessible essays; Anthony Northey's examination of biographical myths vs. realities usefully suggests to non-specialists how we should revise the ideas that Kafka was some working man's crusader within the limits of his job, and how the Castle's women illuminate the place of the real women in K's life. <br />Osman Durrani's chapter on editions, translations, [stage] adaptations compresses fascinating issues arising from these three elements; Helen Hughes and Martin Brady's Kafka and film adaptations, however, suffers from its self-consciously clever style at the expense of detailed analysis (Welles' \\"The Trial\\" gets the best critique, but deserves more in-depth treatment); Iris Bruce's chapter on Kafka and popular culture likewise gives far too little detail and focus mainly on \\"The Fly\\" and \\"Naked Lunch\\"-type homages while barely noticing, say, the whole effect of K. on the tourist industry in Prague or the impact on a wider audience beyond these two movies and a R.

While SK insists that the revolt was for a purer, worker-dominated type of communism (perhaps akin to an anarcho-syndicalist model) free of Soviet imperialism, this argument dims in BL's account. He gives the points that the students and workers distributed and proclaimed, but the whole question of how the Hungarians' new state would contrast with both the capitalist and the communist systems appears rather muddled in his narrative. Maybe such nuanced planning could not be taken in the heat of the moment, as the Hungarians struggled in a few days to drive out the Soviets.<br />Where it excels is in simply telling it like it was: the hunger, the generosity, the giddy sleeplessness, the state of his corduroy jacket, the grease-slicked rifle he hoists. You become so caught up in his vivid descriptions that you wonder why so little about this revolution has reached the West in easily accessible form. His footnotes add valuable details about the fate of his fellow revolutionaries and the mental framework of a \\"typical\\" young man hearing the demands of the leaders for the first time at the university conveys itself here unforgettably.<br />As well, the emotion of encountering liberating and opposing troops in the street, the fear of entering the AVH (secret police) headquarters and the shock of what he and his fighters find there, and the sheer amateur heroics coming up against the jolt of a Soviet muzzle at one's neck makes for an honest re-creation of what Liptak and his young fighters encountered as the counter-attacks flattened the idealistic students waiting for NATO to arrive. Liptak, to his credit, narrates all of the conflicting emotions that result once these guerrillas faced the Soviet troops--some in the latter's ranks thought that they faced the Nazis or Israelis on the Suez Canal!<br />Liptak clearly tells how the Suez crisis overshadowed the Hungarian revolt--and how the Hungarians believed that the West engineered it to distract the world from the revolt. Also, Liptak reminds us of Eisenhower's upcoming election, and why Ike might have wanted to avoid the issue of sending aid to Budapest as he faced re-election.<br />A couple of points that would have benefitted from more in-depth analysis: first, the role of the CIA in infiltrating the National Student Association and the Hungarian students assisted in their education after they fled to the US is not mentioned. As one who participated in this process, Liptak, given his smarts, either keeps silent out of loyalty or ignores the pressures faced by these students to spy for the CIA as perhaps tangential to his own story. Still, given the importance of this whole event of the 1956 rebellion in Cold War terms, Liptak's silence on this topic surprises me.<br />Second, the lack of comparative bibliographical references appears to weaken the wider impact of his testimony. Why does BL not mention SK's own memoirs, published about a decde earlier in North America? I'd be interested in what BL thinks about the previous work, and other first-person accounts and third-person studies of 1956 and its aftermath. He does not fit his own detailed account into any broader tradition of such narratives.<br />Overall, Liptak's account, in its verve and freshness, remains worthwhile reading and I recommend it as one non-fiction book that kept me up late in the night to finish it! Inevitably, all of our own individual accounts rely upon our own limits of evaluation and Liptak does present the tale at its heart as one from \\"Ocsi,\\" his younger self. But the older self might have stepped into the conclusion and presented how he had changed and evolved in his historical understanding of the events which his younger self helped shape.

Reading it--in one sitting--after the author's earlier 1981 collection Orbit of Darkness, I was impressed most with MacMillan's ability to shift into multiple characters and narrative shifts to circle around the year or so before the Treblinka revolt to keep my interest and avoid the neatly plotted historical novel. While his detachment may disappoint those looking for a conventional melodrama, he takes on the challenge of description of the body--and bodies--in an unsparingly clinical manner.<br />This fits the gaze required of the perpetrators and those who they forced to be its victims, for minutes before they were gassed, or for months before they perished as slave workers. By this clinical stance, MacMillan forces us to see the excavation of the bodies for burning as the Soviets threaten to near the camp as the Nazis slowly realize that they will lose the war. The scenes of childbirth, of beatings, of natural beauty somehow still lurking just outside the camp perimeter all join to put you in the place of those who died there, slowly or more rapidly.<br />MacMillan's greatest skill lies not in tying together the loose ends of his plot--people die and vanish without clear explanation, just as it must have been for those in Treblinka. The meticulous research evident here constructs a phenomenological, not a investigative, report of how the camp crushed its victims. You feel the gas chamber for yourself, you see the \\"hospital,\\" you feel yourself losing touch with cold reality as the seasons change. This is not a book for light reading, but it will endure in the minds of those mature enough to accept its version of the extremes under which people will put other people. He avoids cliche, and one scene that I recognized as a holdover from his earlier Orbit story-series repeated a particularly apropos phrase or two, but since the scene of the new dentist's task is so vivid, I'll accept the repetition on artistic grounds. MacM does write painstakingly.<br />4 1/2 stars, for some loose narrative ends that could have either been excised or threaded more satisfactorily, but also the same amount of stars for the craft and morality at the heart of this moving and chilling novel about perverted reality.tion on artistic grounds.

Whether witnessing an old man watching his wife die in an impersonal hospital, mulling over a fellow worker who claims to have seen a Marian apparition, selling carp to Christmas shoppers, helping a neighbor's child who has literally dropped into his apartment, meeting an old flame returned from affluent exile, listening to a professor who sees phallic symbols rearing rampant in the urban landscape, or boating with religious fanatics, Klima deftly captures the flow of moments that accentuate the survival of the sensitive and the idealistic holdouts who refuse to give in to the system.  Even the rants he describes avoid stereotype, and the subtle criticism of the dissident permeates these vignettes in a well-crafted, undogmatic, and moving manner. Although George Theiner (not as photographer but as translator) gives Klima's voice a bit too much of a working-class British inflection, the English version succeeds in its colloquial, unforced fluency. This is what post-1968 Prague must have been like, you think. Far from the Charles Bridge and the Stare Mesto. Grim suburbs, bulldozed fields, damp mattresses, endless queues. Worth remembering today, and to learn from how the Stalinist experiment warped all those under its control.	2003-06-23

Comic book knights, Bohemians in the ancient sense of the word, a curious order of Catholic (?) sisters, Native American legend, trash-heap denizens, a forest journey in the Ruthenian mountains in which our hero and his love stumble into the Warhol(a) Museum, Laotian refugees, tender lovemaking, lots of violence, and most notably an extended visit from Mr. Novak and the field of bones at Auschwitz are among a few of this book's highlights.<br />It feels like, as reviewers remarked, Clockwork Orange (in its vocative mood, its frequent addresses to its audience, and in its linguistic/philosophical-theological, and urban melanges) meets Trainspotting (drugs galore, incoherence, muddly plotline, and dialects beyond counting). You'll lost track of who's who and what's what, but this may be intentional on Topol's part as he recreates the world of illusions, or my difficulty with a rather alien Central European host of allusions. Sheer love of storytelling doggedly pushes you on. Topol creates his own original novel, and the strange beauty mixed in with endless goings-on that stretch over 500 closely printed pages lull you into an hypnotic state of altered consciousness when you plow on through this daunting text.<br />Keep going, give in to the flow, and the book will take you in if you're patient. Alex Zucker's introductory notes help non-Czechs gain a rough background for what we can expect, and the fact that the prose moves so well, so densely, and so vividly attests to his and Topol's considerable skills. I predict even better work from their future collaborations. Although it's a difficult book to handle in its Pynchonesque, Joycean ambition, it rewards you with hundreds of vignettes, miniature scenes pulled out of reveries and terrors for our delight and instruction. A more serious book at its core than the punkish surface may let on, the respect for mercy, faith, and humanity beneath the mayhem and alienation reminds us that the search for enduring values persists in the most unlikely fictional and factual terrains. And, like Dante at his quest's end, somehow he sees and does not see his Beatrice again. At least that's my guess. See for yourself. This book marvelously conjures up images from its descriptions, and you too drift through space.rors for our delight and instruction.

Four set pieces alone would justify reading of this novel: the making of Tolstoy's death mask (the narrator describes that the cement left one of the Count's recently closed eyes with a little popping sound); a true revolt of the proles unfolds just as the camera man hopes for footage of the same to stand in for the Kremlin where Stalin \\"might\\" have been as an extra if he had not really not been there for the October (read: November) revolution; the embalming of Lenin as he/before he dies; and the final chapter's stream-of-consciousness relation of the rise and fall of the USSR from Lenin's own supine p-o-v.<br />I came to this novel curious about how ideas are sold to people, and the novelistic control of this theme more than rewards the careful reader. Not a long book, this is both its strength and its slight shortcoming. I imagine Kalfus had pared down a longer draft, as there is no unessential material here at all. A lesser novelist would have wandered into fleshing out more characters, following up the fates of Volodov and Astapov with subplots stretching into the future, and would have showed off more of his (or her) knowledge about the time. I'll certainly search out his two earlier volumes of short stories now. As the bibliographical note after the novel indicates, his research matches his fictional talents. He even acknowledges Sheila Fitzpatrick's \\"unimaginatively titled\\" Commissariat of Enlightenment--for such an organization did exist, as Fitzpatrick studies. What a title: a group to enforce and rule over indoctrination into \\"scientific\\" study of history, laden with documents written by intellectuals for workers to educate the latter about why they were so idolized by the former.<br />With a keen understanding of the, well, dialectics involved in such a Soviet mission, Kalfus deletes, drains, and cuts, like the film editing, the embalming, and the dictate by terror that he intertwines into the three themes of his story. It makes for gripping if not casual reading. I only wish he had allowed more room for following through Astapov's fate after the establishment of Stalin's power. Yes, a whole other novel is buried in a few asides of this one. I wish there was a sequel--Kalfus makes you care about all three of his protagonists, no mean feat when they all turn out to be so terrifying in their respective devotions to their propagandistic crafts.ing if not casual reading.

No triumph of the indomitable human spirit or uplifting morality for MacM's gallery of survivors, perpetrators, and victims. While you admire the starving priest, you also sense the objective view of his \\"martyrdom.\\" Such a \\"fly on the wall\\" distancing shows that powerful fiction still can emerge from reality whose terrain seems to have been thoroughly excavated in the past half century.<br />MacM's style does not draw you in and it does not repel you. It lists, it describes, and it moves on. His perspective takes in more than the stereotypical \\"survivor\\" account--he looks at partisan fighters in the marshes, a family reduced (most of them unwittingly at first) to cannibalism, a Nazi soldier as Berlin falls, fighters in the sewers of Warsaw, functionaries turned documentarians of pornography, and teens who witness from afar a scene that begins \\"they were shooting the wedding party into a ditch.\\"<br />This is the part of the array provided by MacM, who later wrote a novelization of the Treblinka uprising, \\"Village of a Million Spirits.\\" His work deserves attention, for it shows how writers outside of direct involvement with the Shoah can enter into its imaginative possibilities and continue to confront us with the moral and dramatic struggles it keeps raising in the imagination of all of us who grow up in its receding but still chilling shadows.	2003-06-16
US	53087372	R6L8XDPOLP2VO	0375727019	185430326	The Elementary Particles	Books	3	8	9	N	N	Better read for its hopeful ideas, not its naughty bits	I read this six months ago, and over this period I've kept thinking about this book. One reviewer suggests that you read not Camus but Cordwainer Smith instead--an apt comparison perhaps lost on the existentialist coffeehouse denizens. Like pseudonymous Smith, MH provides stimulating critiques of the status quo via rather overly complicated stories. While in science fiction, where Smith's relegated, such an exchange of thought for sometimes less assured fictional skill is an expected tradeoff for readers, it seems many who bristle at MH's rants against the \\"new boss same as the old boss\\" fall into an easy trap set up by an author all too eager to goad and provoke.<br /><br />I liked the novel of ideas underneath the posturing surface of sex, drugs, rock n'roll. I barely noticed any explicitness in the content--but as I'm the same age as MH, maybe we're unshockable--part of the author's point, no? Again, the distance of translation must be acknowledged--in French perhaps his prose slaps you harder? (3 1/2 stars in English, therefore...)<br /><br />What leaves an impression with me months later is the longing for transcendence that the novel conveys. In fact, the conclusion moved me greatly, and I'm about as sentimental as MH (or at least as he claims to be in his press kit). MH captures a contemporary yearning for fulfillment that many readers might flinch from--the lonely keyboardist being a figure all too familiar to online bibliophiles. I would have liked 90% of the novel to have focused upon the reformation of the world rather than only in the end chapter within which such interesting visions are locked. (Parts of the conclusion reminded me of the Fritjof Capra talkathon film \\"Mindwalk\\"--for all the pluses and minuses that brings--the philosophical dia/trialogue borrowed from Galileo for our New Age, and another French setting!) True, there'd be less lucrative raunch, but more nourishing content. The manifesto quality of this chapter shows in fact that MH's true skill might lie more in social criticism than fiction, but that's a genre that sells even worse, and is less likely to grab profiles in the NY Times Magazine--which is how I first heard of MH, after all!<br /><br />I'm adding to this, although it's chronologically buried for all but the most assiduous scourer of back reviews, that this novel, despite its flaws, is the one to start with; Platform's take on sexual tourism and the travel industry and The Possibility of an Island's return to the cloning scenario that ends The Elementary Particles both extend intriguingly (if no less clumsily as fiction rather than essays--perhaps where Houllebecq's true calling lies, but you cannot in that format play with the imaginative possibilities so teasingly!) elements first raised in TEP.<br /><br />MH has lamented the effort put into his first novel, Whatever, when it failed to arouse the lumpenintellectualariat against the consumer cyber age all we amazonians admittedly enjoy.

Rather, I'd like to suggest that readers tackle this work after they read &quot;Fateless.&quot; There's allusions to this more accessible novel in the novella; the latter seems to me more the interest of a philosophically inclined reader's group. While &quot;Fateless&quot; can be read on one's own and grasped, I believe that &quot;Kaddish&quot; would be better suited for collective study and discussion.<br />It offers few of the pleasures of fiction. Rather, with its considerations of Adorno, Hegel, and Bernhard, and with its nods to the prose of Beckett, Camus, Sartre, and perhaps Kafka, it's more a meditation/fulmination than a novel with an easy plot trajectory. It offers food for thought, but may be rather indigestible if gulped in one sitting. This is more the type of work that Nobel laureates get rewarded for late in their careers; the popular acclaim granted &quot;Fearless&quot; by contrast would first gain an audience for this author, in my estimation.<br />Again, this is not to detract from Kertesz' achievement, but simply to point out that (at least in English), this compressed, concentrated message may better be shared if taken in smaller, diluted portions among like-minded friends. (My impression is that in the original Hungarian, the agglutinative nature of that language would make this an even heavier, more weighty lump of prose.) It would serve as a fitting challenge after you've all read and discussed &quot;Fateless.&quot; As I suggest, this novel can be contemplated with profit by one's self; this smaller work is best divided, nibbled, and ruminated over bite by bitter bite.	2003-05-27

The book breaks off just as the narrator chooses to hide and therefore conitnue his fight against the never-named but omnipresent \\"them.\\"<br />The rapacity and cunning of \\"them\\" remind you of Art Speigelman's \\"Maus,\\" and I wonder if he read this novel earlier. The picture of daily life outside the camps is told with details which constantly circle back to the narrator's lost (married) lover, and understandably, these obsessions only fade gradually, as the transports impinge more directly upon the Jews.<br />The metaphor of the circus, in which the only animals are people, is sustained admirably in this section of the novel, and the translation conveys well the bare irony of the minimalist style. Almost childlike in its observations, the tone of the novel may be off-putting to some readers wanting more elaborated insight. It took me about sixty or seventy pages to get used to the rhythm, and only in the halfway point did it fully compel me. But I read it in one sitting.<br />Why? By its steady momentum, you are carried into the horror even as it does not overwhelm you. Through the control of the protagonist, you too gain control over the situation, and resolve to resist the temptation to give in to complacency.<br />The characters remain in your memory: Roubitschek and his onion, the narrator's almost comic aunt and uncle who blame the whole Nazi invasion it seems on their nephew, Ruzema's memory, and most of all, Tomas the cat. Rarely has a pet assumed such an evocative place in such a story. The daily task of finding food when you can buy so little. The scene of the names being called for transport in the synagogue, the depictions of the grave digging detail, the narrator's shattered home, and the growing despair that battles against the realization that the slow advance of the Allies means that people \\"out there\\" are actually fighting to save the narrator: all these add up subtly to a powerful testimony.<br />The narrator must wear a star that shines only at day, that gives no warmth, that is pinned over one's own heart, but over the course of the novel, he realizes that his status as the \\"other\\" frees him (almost like a Camus character) to live.<br />Worthy of comparison to Imre Kertesz' \\"Fateless,\\" and Primo Levi's memoirs, this overlooked novel deserves much wider attention.

I doubt that much is fictionalized here; the novel is too fragmented and disjointed to work as a seamless work of art. Rather, it conveys how brutality and rationality contest within the viewpoint of the narrator: German efficiency meets mass cruelty. What I liked about this work was its refusal to become manipulative. Granted, there's no pandering to easy emotion here, and that may put off readers looking for a humanizing, life-affirming message-laden story.<br />The descent from the \\"easy\\" to the harsher times, as the narrator must resist giving in like the \\"Latvians,\\" the long time \\"Moslems\\" (sic) who somehow live but have died inside, comes rather suddenly--just as it must have to camp laborers. The infirmary segment, in its refusal to become clarified, marks a powerfully unsettling stage in both the book and the narrator's confrontation with the mystery of the Nazi mentality that cares for a few while killing the many.<br />Brief as it is, the re-emergence into Budapest after liberation remains equally effective for its quality to one having awakened from the nightmare only to be gawked at by his fellow citizens as he journeys home still in his hodgepodge of camp and castoff attire. Again, the anti-humanism and existentialist quality of Kertesz' book attest to a refusal to accept the facile answer for what can only be described but never truly shared by us.<br />Unlike other Hungarian works translated into English, I found the prose readable, colloquial, and the tone, while distancing, appropriate to the content. My only suggestion would have been an autobiographical forward or translator's afterward about the author, as this updated framework would have been helpful for those of us who had only heard of Kertesz until his reward of the Nobel laureate.	2003-05-25

The accounts here, by a cross-section of thoughtful, self-deprecating, agonized, and bewildered observers, show why those in the ghetto were so diminished and demoralized.<br />Years of abuse, mental and physical, years of starving and disease and uncertainty wreaked havoc on the Jews in Warsaw. Reading these accounts, you understand how awful were the limited choices between giving in and holding out could both be. Also, what here emerges more fully is the extent to which Jews were exploited with the hopes of work permits, resettlement, visas, and hush money by informers, turncoats, bosses, and those willing or forced to collaborate. The constant anxiety underscores the bodily suffering of the ghetto's inhabitants.<br />Revealed here are the predicaments hundreds of thousands of people like you and me faced, nearly half-a-million crowded into an area the size of Central Park. What often has been distorted into kitsch or melodrama in later re-creations in its original context remains unforgettably eloquent.	2003-05-03

During the night of his plan, he converses with two hostages: an ex-prisoner from the north of Ireland, and an ex-porn actress from Germany. Both of the hostages are working at Disney when they're captured, taken away from considerably less attention-getting jobs as they muddle through the mid-1990s.<br />Patterson's novels (\\"Burning Your Own,\\" \\"Fat Lad,\\" and my favorite, \\"The International,\\") all evoke Belfast in its charm and vitality, getting beyond its the more familiar stereotypes. Far from glossing over the media and propaganda images, Patterson takes them and with the agility of a native son, upends them to examine them coldly but not despairingly. Here, too, Belfast lives in its pages. Unlike his other novels, however, the scope broadens to encompass Paris' seedier districts, postwar Germany, and the Disney think-tank in Southern California.<br />Seems to me that Patterson has obtained his knowledge of L.A. largely from Mike Davis' \\"City of Quartz\\" with its \\"Narcopolis\\" and \\"Narcopolice.\\" I don't think UCLA has theology majors, but otherwise his details, I can attest, seem plausible enough for the American sections of his novel. Similarly, he gives his Parisian settings,notably of the church on Montmartre and Pigalle, a well-observed quality: of one flower-seller enduring her lucrative tourist trade, he tells us of her smile, \\"of the professionally enchanted.\\"<br />The reason I only give this book 3(1/2) stars is that the decline of the protagonist. the Disney wonder gone to speed, while told cleverly, fails to convince. His slide from capable and clever worker to strung-out addict happens in too clumsy a manner. While the experimentation shown with prose (a bit of Joyce and Beckett perhaps, if only subtly) and plot is praiseworthy--a pattern Patterson exhibits to his credit in all of his novels--Sam's fall from grace seems too scattered to make us care. While this may be the point, the somewhat distant narration only moves us further away from much sympathy with his delusional predicament.<br />And I wish I had known much more about his two hostages. If the novel had brought them even more alive, it would have held my sympathy much more. Still, you can never regret reading Patterson, and his work deserves much more attention. If you like him, check out another view of Belfast from his contemporary, the apparently more irascible Robert MacLiam Wilson, in \\"Eureka Street\\" and \\"Ripley Bogle.\\"Joyce and Beckett perhaps, if only subtly) and plot is praiseworthy--a pattern Patterson exhibits to his credit in all of his novels--Sam's fall from grace seems too scattered to make us care.

Instead, after reading Erno Szep's story a few weeks spent digging trenches in a slave labor camp, you close the book not weary of a cheerless tale, but wishing you could have found out more--especially after Szep returned to Budapest just in time for the Soviet siege and the Nazi/Arrow Cross defense. In a series of very brief episodes, he relates with all the detail he can bear his view of the Jews in Budapest as most of its \\"able\\" men first were rounded up, then sent off to work under the sneers and beatings of the Arrow Cross. He conveys vividly the feel of forced labor and little food, the monotony, the damp, and the hunger increasing as their supplies and energy dwindle and the toil takes its toll.<br />Unlike some other Hungarian translations of texts, this one by John Batki, a scholar who left Hungary as a teenager, manages to render into very colloquial but never casual English what must be marvelous Magyar prose. Szep's style evidently is cosmopolitan, with a snap and joie de vivre that persists despite his subject matter. Imagine a less taciturn, more convivial counterpart to Primo Levi. My only withholding of a fifth star in the rating: a stereotypically verbose and clumsily experimental preface by Dezso Tandori that reminds me of the worst of translated Hungarian stylists too enamoured of their own cleverness to remember their reader's attention span. Stick with Szep's own \\"autobiographical statement\\" and Batki's remarks. How I wish Szep had written much more! (1884-1953)<br />Parts of his story shed new light on old events: the process by which were extended, denied, and re-extended passes by the Swedish (although Raoul Wallenberg's not mentioned by name--perhaps postwar Hungarian censorship may have been a factor?) and Spanish embassies; the fate of those who had grown up entirely Christian by birth and belief but had Jewish grandparents; the more recent converts hoping the excape the yellow star; and the printers. In this last vignette, Szep wonders why that largely socialist union, in WWI, allowed its members to produce so much propaganda for the capitalists. If they had simply refused to print the disortions of the ruling class, Szep muses, perhaps war would have been averted. Hmmm.birth and belief but had Jewish grandparents; the more recent converts hoping the excape the yellow star; and the printers.

Reminded me of the tone of Joyce's &quot;Dubliners&quot; in their attempt to combine the mundane with the transcendent. However, their often flat tone distances the reader from identifying with the characters. This may be due to translation, but for an English-language reader, the interest conveyed through these wartime vignettes of Budapest Jewry endures more than their literary merit. Tbe final story, however, nearly redeems the interrelated collection with its epiphany of an imagined revival of the district today.	2003-04-22

Now, as his new introduction points out, he's the establishment! Most scholars seem to have accepted his findings, largely based upon the massive amount of archival sources he has exhumed, and Connolly proves tenacious in defending his perspectives.<br />The book thankfully does not lapse into jargon or grudge matches against academic rivals. Largely left to stand on its own, the text proper is revised less, leaving readers needing a catch-up on the issues raised in the past twenty years to turn to Connolly's introduction. While I wish he had taken on the issues he raises in his introduction and worked them back into the original text more, the likely symptom of many scholars--he doesn't want to go back and rewrite his dissertation again--doubtless may be the reason for this selective revision.<br />Readable and detailed, yet never overwhelming the newcomer to 18-19 c.Irish history, this book's the place to start for pre-Famine analyses of the Church.	2003-04-21

Uncommon too: the ability to revive on the page the stories of one's family members going back hundreds of years. In clear prose, largely uncluttered by cliche or digression, Fenyvesi offers a well-told series of vignettes and anecdotes, mixed with his own encounters with the people descended from the peasants his ancestors once employed.<br />Most of the book takes place not in Budapest (home to 98% of the surviving Jews in the country; 6/7 of the Jewish population was killed in the Holocaust) but in the villages near and far from the provincial city of Debrecen. This gives added interest to what has largely been documented as an urban saga for Hungarian Jewry, and the love of the author's family for their land goes far to explain why nothing short of extermination moved the Fenyvesis and Kaufmanns from their beloved roots in such a seemingly ordinary terrain.<br />The author, as a gardener himself, shares this understanding of bonds between land and lore, and writes well of the connections established in his family between Judaism, farming, loyalty, and continuity. His stories range from humorous to harrowing, and his family runs the usual gamut of believers, skeptics, rebels, and good-natured souls. I only held back a star in my rating because the last chapters in the book noticeably lacked the interest for me that the majority of the book had sustained.<br />Nonetheless, this is a fine example of a book that adults as well as teenagers eager to find out more about Central Europe and Jewry should seek out. It's uncommon to get a viewpoint that's neither shetl nor city, and for so long a period that focuses on the family within the nation and takes the microcosmic view to show the greater detail needed to appreciate the connections joining a people's love for the local with their grappling with their place in the wider culture and their faith.ons joining a people's love for the local with their grappling with their place in the wider culture and their faith.	2003-04-21

Richard Teleky's essay collection, \\"Hungarian Rhapsodies,\\" I had dismissed in that review his article on Esterhazy and admitted that I felt no attraction to Esterhazy's watered-down postmodernism in spite of Teleky's attempts to arouse Western readers' interest in this writer so admired by Hungarian critics. Now, knowing that translation and my own ignorance may have prejudiced me, I decided to give Esterhazy his own chance to win me over as a reader.  Maybe I was wrong and Teleky was right?<br />I vowed to approach this book optimistically. I thought this imaginary travelogue could appeal; I figured it'd serve as an appetizer for the main course, the meatier and even denser non-fictional account of a second journey down the same river that Claudio Magris serves up as \\"Danube.\\" Two books on journeys down the river through Central Europe, both emerging post-1989. I started with what seemed the easier one, the fictional journey.<br />Outside of the account of his native Budapest in the middle of the narrative, related with a heavy debt to Italo Calvino's \\"Invisible Cities,\\" this novel meanders when it should flow in a linear direction, like the river itself. Vienna barely registers, Romania's blurred, and the comlplicate meta-fictional structures and intricate levels of intertextuality left me with no aftertaste. Nothing to savor. Doldrums. Sargasso-ish sea.<br />I know it's au courant to borrow Borges' imaginary books to cite, Joyce's nightmare dialogues, the whole 20c of European Lit when it comes to experimenting with Traveller vs. Tourist and truth vs. fiction, but Esterhazy here fails to reward my efforts.<br />From about pp. 130-190, yes, the Budapest section does satisfy a bit, but despite the book's paltry footnotes, there is much that left me empty and I couldn't have cared less to track down the erudition Esterhazy possesses and I lack. Unlike Magris (who the former author mentions very late in the book--written a few years after Magris' magisterial survey), the Hungarian author appears to not much care about the story, the characters, or the plot. The book's clumsily conveyed (at least in English) and the reader's given no context from which (unlike Joyce or Borges) some meaning can be extracted given diligence and attention.<br />What the plot builds up to is anyone's guess; he seems to have tired of the whole enterprise after the Budapest section. Only bare fleeting bits of emotion felt by people who have suffered in the mitteleuropean landscapes he rushes past remain to move you as a reader. Rarely have I read such an ambitious book by a purportedly renowned novelist that fails to rise to even a basic level of engaging my attention--and I've read my share of such post-modern efforts, and I'm familiar with the effort often expected from readers before the pay-off accrues. Here, no jackpot.<br />Maybe again this post-1989 cynicism and detachment is the proper pose to assume, but Esterhazy through this book comes off looking like a fop, and the fictional fashions he dons look secondhand and no more trendy or even retro this time around.

Ellegood International Publications)	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Fills a niche for Hungarian expats and non-Magyars too	Due to the linguistic isolation of Hungarian, its cultural and literary wealth has become trapped in a Slavic and Germanic slurry surrounding its terrain. Teleky, as a Canadian/American third-generation Hungarian, seeks to fit his understanding into the familiar pattern of the ethnic revival of interest among those far removed from their original homeland. As an Irish American myself, I found his searches appealing to me also; the comparisons and contrasts among different sensibilities and the struggles to regain our grasp on difficult ancestral tongues brought his essay on learning Hungarian close to my mental home.<br />His chapters on stereotypes and Joe Esterhazy's film \\"The Music Box\\" I found particularly impressive for their mix of erudition and unforced satirical/incisive commentary. Dismantling the kitsch and tchotkes assembled by expats and Hollywood seems to be a notable skill for Teleky, and makes for his best work here.<br />For an academic, he writes surprisingly well! That is, his essays aim for the \\"educated general reader\\" instead of the professoriate. Always clear, modest, and focusing upon the subject more than himself--even when the subject is himself! Many nationalities feature such essayists seeking to connect themselves back to their roots; Teleky's collection appears to me--as an outsider to this nation's studies--to fill this necessary niche in the Hungarian section of the few English-language studies found on most library or bookstore's cultural shelf. For those of us not able to enter into the Magyar language, Teleky's crossing of the boundary between the Anglophone world and the Hungarian realm shows how valuable that encounter can be. I give this book four, not five, stars only because of personal bias; some of the essays--however clearly conveyed--simply failed to grab me. I doubt, for instance, that after reading Teleky on Peter Esterhazy's daunting post-modern novels I'll rush out to read any. Teleky's promotion of Esterhazy seems a bit half-hearted, as if many of this novelists' tricks dazzle less once his legerdemain has been revealed as imitations of other European literary magicians over the past century or so.<br />Not that many revelations await him, for instance, when he finally journeys to Hungary in 1993 for the first time. But his refusal to glamorize or over-interpret what he sees is refreshing. He keeps his perspective and sense of humor. And of balance. By avoiding theorizing and refusing to inflate his own stature as an observer, he offers honest essays each \\"assaying\\" the value of the little treasures and trinkets he puts under scrutiny as we watch.<br />I'd also recommend Monica Porter's \\"The Paper Bridge\\" for another expat's visit for a month circa 1980, and Zsuzsanna Ardo's \\"Culture Shock: Hungary\\" for two other books interpreting Hungarian mores and sensibilities for the rest of us, whatever our bloodlines.half-hearted, as if many of this novelists' tricks dazzle less once his legerdemain has been revealed as imitations of other European literary magicians over the past century or so.<br />Not that many revelations await him, for instance, when he finally journeys to Hungary in 1993 for the first time.

One of \\"Kingstown\\" and one of greater Dublin might've aided those unfamiliar with some of the terrain. Being a native of Dun Laoghaire (post-1922 \\"Kingstown\\"), O'Neill seems a bit too confident that all of us can follow the travels of his protagonists without much assistance.<br />Like much in his novel, however, a slow immersion into the swim proves necessary to avoid reader's cramps. I found the Joycean imitations in his various narratives fascinating, but those less enamoured of \\"Ulysses\\" seeking a more straight(pun?)forward telling of historical romance understandably may become frustrated with the experimentation O'Neill indulges in and the expectation that we're familiar with the dense context and subtext surrounding characters such as Eva MacM and Mr Mack. Not to mention slang, Connolly and Pearse (deftly sketched both) and the whole Irish-Ireland milieu of nine decades past. But, slowly, persistence and attention to nuance cue you in to essentials.<br />The novel actually lightens about halfway in its telling, only to in its final chapters go back to a Bloom's-eye passersby look at the beginning of the Rising that I found appealing. Once again, however, O'Neill keeps the p-o-v shifting like the Wandering Rocks and we have to tag along with his Odyssean urge to plow forward into a more Gertie McDowell style and almost a parody of popular page-turners before shoving the plot into the climactic battle scenes, that I found suprisingly moving in parts and cluttered and nearly slapdash elsewhere. \\"The fog of war\\" reified?<br />The ending let me down quite a bit. You anticipate when beginning the last chapter perhaps a sequel to this book. Having lived so long with his characters, O'Neill and I didn't want to let them go. But the last pages telescope too much into too little space. As with many epic stories, the telling of the journey becomes the reason to follow the adventures O'Neill recites, more than the rapid rush to hurry up for a rapid and flaccid denouement.<br />The cumulative power of the novel, nevertheless, provides an engrossing and sensitive look from a fresh perspective at events familiar to \\"Irish Historical Scholars,\\" gay and straight alike. Like another recent look at these events, its own narrative alternately assured and maddening--Roddy Doyle's revisionist take on Dublin and its struggle towards (partial) independence, \\"A Star Called Henry\\"--O'Neill offers us a well-told story inescapably in Joyce's long shadow but struggling towards its own light, nourished and bloodied by 1916's history tangled with Irish fiction's strong Joycean roots.journey becomes the reason to follow the adventures O'Neill recites, more than the rapid rush to hurry up for a rapid and flaccid denouement. <br />The cumulative power of the novel, nevertheless, provides an engrossing and sensitive look from a fresh perspective at events familiar to \\"Irish Historical Scholars,\\" gay and straight alike.

Not that the statue stays maximized: the whole point of the climactic Hungarian 1956 revolt. Fischer's style I found appealing, even laugh-out-loud funny (and I don't often audibly guffaw while reading!). I read it for its depictions of 1940s-50's Budapest, and how ordinary folks tried to survive. Great tongue-in-cheek depictions of Party exhortations, an oddly appealing Jesuit, an honest romance and a lot of less lengthy couplings, and a meditation on courage amidst a world of betrayers. Managing to avoid cliche and to rather strive for the original phrase, Fischer's novel satisfies. I only wish there was a sequel.	2003-03-19

My ideal author. But, fourth time at bat, without the tension often provided in his previous fictional settings by their comparative isolation, this urban vision of Mills fails to excite. It reads well, but carries no edge. His other novels thrived on conjuring menace behind simple, repetitive tasks and apparently simple, workaday mates.<br />Here you get the mates and the repetition, but not the menace. That leaves you with an allegory about capitalism but not the edge of his other fiction, which mixes tranquility with threat.<br />Also, the lack of a strong female character undercuts the energy often pent up and prowling in Mills' other matey protagonists. Without much of an outlet for the narrator's ambition outside the job, the story lacks mystery. Even his out-of-town jaunts, while they too find (as in other novels) a rather enigmatic assemblage, here seem more suburban than his rural bucolic/haunted landscapes entered by constructors and repairers.<br />Stick with his other books, and hope that this is only a delayed \\"sophomore slump.\\" After the perfect endings of his other three novels, we can cut him a little slack--like his all too human characters ludicrously but touchingly reflecting  ourselves.	2003-03-19

Suprisingly, the opening chapters proved gripping, filled with enthusiastically rendered anecdotes about early rulers, medieval battles, and lots of double-crossing diplomats and nobles. There's material here for a dozen epic (English-language at least!) novels or movies. Extracts from historical novels sprinkled throughout the book from otherwise untranslated Hungarian authors spice up Sisa's entrees vividly.<br />As Hungary becomes its own empire, then falls under Turkish and Habsburg dominance, the story keeps pace. When the Austrians take over, and nationalism emerges, you root for the heroes even as Sisa fairly tries to show how other Hungarians and minority peoples allied with the imperialists for their own reasons. Distinguishing the \\"state\\" from a \\"people\\" and a \\"nation\\" clarifies his presentation for Western readers who may lump these terms differently than they apply to Central Europe and the Balkans.<br />I found the latter part of the book a bit less engrossing; I expected more on 1956 and especially the Kadar period up to 1989. This post-revolt stage seems glossed over too quickly, even as other sections elaborate (especially in the second and third editions) in too much detail for the novice diplomatic and territorial confrontations with Romania, the former Czechoslovakia, and the Balkan states regarding Hungarian minorities and the aftermath of Trianon. This material may better suit political students of this period than the first-time reader wanting a panoramic view of Hungarian history and culture.<br />The absence of tanchaz music and the 1980s folk-music revival (Muszikas, Marta Sebestyen, romany/gypsy artists for example) bringing Hungary onto the \\"world music\\" scene means that you find a lot deservedly on classical music but not its modern folk offshoots and grafts. However, plenty of coverage of art and literature balances this omission, I suppose.<br />Written with obvious love and passion, yet remaining fair-minded about, say, the mixed blessings and upheavals Jewish immigration caused in the 19th c., the betrayals of its leaders, or the demands of minorities within Hungary's shifting borders, Sisa's book filled a need for a popularly aimed, solid work--belying its coffee-table size and rather rough-hewn cut-and-paste (pre-word processing) layout. Best read a few chapters at a time, the old-fashioned way: in a comfy armchair, propped open on your lap.Written with obvious love and passion, yet remaining fair-minded about, say, the mixed blessings and upheavals Jewish immigration caused in the 19th c., the betrayals of its leaders, or the demands of minorities within Hungary's shifting borders, Sisa's book filled a need for a popularly aimed, solid work--belying its coffee-table size and rather rough-hewn cut-and-paste (pre-word processing) layout.

It's the ending that deflates what could've ended with a bang: not literally but dramatically. Tolstaya loves her creation, and the grim blend of satire and realism in the post-apocalyptic shadows she presents often proves moving in its narrator's attempts to make linguistic and philosophical sense out of the beauties and the harshness he (at first uncomprehendingly) witnesses.<br />Parts of this book, especially in its first half, offer scenes of memorable poverty and ingenious social commentary. Maybe for Western readers the poetic remnants from past Russian voices resonate less, and there's details (as in the layout of the hamlet) that those of us unfamiliar with Moscow don't really &quot;matter&quot; the way they might to a Russian reader. Still, the fall and rise of the narrator keeps you page-turning. Especially relevant are passages keyed towards booklovers and the pages we hoard and guard against the unlettered mobs: these musings are among the best in the novel and well worth attention.<br />Though I doubt any of us could match the appetite of the narrator's bookishness THAT much; but, read it for yourself.<br />The novel's pace in its latter third (cf. Riddley Walker's plot) seems too predictable given the variety Tolstaya's invented so far. I cannot figure out why she could not sustain a more satisfying climax and denouement. Again, distance from the original text and context may be partly to blame; I may not recognize all the symbolic figures or allegorical allusions that a native reader might find more illuminating.<br />Granting this discrepancy, I emphasize that the build-up doesn't lead to an equally inventive conclusion. So much wit and poignancy and insight pours into this novel, but it overflows into a storyline that spills out and diffuses its gathered potency into dribbles and splats.	2003-03-19

Here, while broadening his scope to give a panorama of linguistic change over the world and the millennia, he mixes admittedly for me an overwhelming amount of detail on creoles and pidgins into his wider concerns. You do find that his style is often colloquial and witty, but for those of us non-linguists (in the learned sense), we need such a popularization of scholarly endeavors.<br />I bogged down in Steven Pinker's &quot;The Language Instinct&quot; halfway after it started strongly and then seemed to overwhelm me with neurology. Mc W's book, by contrast, explored what I'd always<br />wondered: why do languages start out so complex and then grow more simplified, rather than vice-versa as in the natural world?<br />While McW does not exactly solve this mystery so much as admit that languages tend to ornament and filigree given the space and often the initial isolation to do so, his exploration of the topic takes in many pop culture references that appealed to me.<br />As a college professor myself, you can't get too sniffy about connecting what students (and newcomers like many of us coming to linguistics via such general accounts as McW's) know to what the more educated people think about a particular field. Only 35 or so, McW has an amazing range of examples from his own experiences, cultural and media allusions, and academic invesigations to bring into his ambitious overview.<br />By the very nature of a popularizing book, any academic or layperson daring to translate jargon and charts into actually disseminated knowledge to a wider audience risks the inevitable run-in with meticulous specialists. Both scholarly camps deserve their place. McW can skip from Chomsky to the quip nimbly. While he must have simplified many debates to make a quick assertion, a look at McW's bibliographic notes show how immersed he is in his studies. But he never loses his common touch with those of us know-nothings. Throughout, his footnotes and asides on such matters as Simpsons and South Park characters, dubbing Married With Children into German, how getting drunk (Germans again) effects dialectal emergence, and why Lloyd Webber musicals pale before BBC comedies all make his more erudite points more digestible and memorable. He must be a great classroom teacher at Berkeley.<br />Again, his writing style does strike me as rather too casual and some of the book feels rushed out, but his personality and enthusiasm overcome these shortcomings. Yes, a more reserved academic has probably produced a more rigorous work on this on some library's back shelf, but for those of us without a course in linguistics or the luck to be at Berkeley, this book offers a bracing first dive into the swirling eddies of language change.<br />It leaves me with a question: McW notes that the puzzling assignment of gender in Germanic languages may stem from some now lost idea in folk wisdom or proto-Germanic/Indo-European myth. I wish we knew more about this! Many such fascinating tidbits nestle in these pages, and you'll enjoy finding your own.er loses his common touch with those of us know-nothings.

US	53087372	RB7E7VXNVR0YN	0809088355	890857082	Stealing from a Deep Place; Travels in Southeastern Europe	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Not for cyclists but armchair travellers	Brian Hall's enjoyable account wants to accomplish different goals. One, how one bicycles across Balkans and Carpathians and the plains in between, is surprisingly absent from much of the text. Looking at the map of his route, you realize how little of it he describes in detail. Not a bad thing in itself, for the day-by-day relation of one's travel wherever it is gets annoying--like seeing home movies of another's trip--but it left me wondering why the mechanics of the route gain only attention when the bike breaks down. Almost no sensation of going up and down what must be magnificent vistas appears here; you forget that he's pedalling for months, and the heights are rarely present. Only the stays on the dreary flatlands (with one great exception in Melnik, admittedly).<br />Now these two points--breakdown and stay in mountain hamlet--are highlights of the book, and Brian's meeting with a know-it-all &quot;fixer&quot; in a horrible industrial city is told remarkably well, but still I was left ignorant of so much that must have happened along the route just in terms of being on the saddle.<br />Perhaps Hall wants to focus on the human side? Second goal of the book. In his Romanian visit with Georgina and her letter, he again gets to the heart of living under constant and evasive scrutiny. He lets one incident speak presumably for many others.<br />His economical telling of these events makes them engrossing, but you wonder: why so few events given the length of his route and the folks he must have seen?<br />His natural descriptions are sparing, less vividly told than, say, his predecessor Patrick Leigh Fermor. But when he chooses to relate his visions they are wonderful: cakes in a bakery, brush fires at twilight, that mountain village near the Greek border, and the Chain Bridge in Budapest all receive glowing but tempered vignettes. His language is tbat of the Harvard grad you'd expect: mercifully not too bookish, savvy and colloquial, but with a hint of deeper insight and erudition sprinkled in when appropriate among the clearly told scenes. He intersperses historical accounts inro the work, not as smoothly as Fermor, more like an another American visitor a decade later, Eva Hoffman (Exit From History). But for the newcomer, these help.<br />So, why three (and a half) stars? The book does not gel. After two-thirds of the book, the Romanian and Bulgarian parts, the Hungarian section that follows leaves you scratching your head. Third goal unmet. Like Fermor's Angela in the second volume of similar climes, Hall's reticence in elucidating his relationship casts a shadow on the page. For Fermor, it was out of necessary discretion. For Hall, I'm puzzled. At the start of the book, he mentions that he met &quot;someone&quot; in Budapest and would be going back there, but much of the Hungarian bike ride, and the whole countryside that he must have seen, is missing from his urban account.<br />True, the best scenes in Romania and Bulgaria come near borders for Hall, but his focus on the domestic and the familial in the latter third of the book as he lives with Zsosa and visits her family seems like it should have been a separate memoir.<br />He could have told a more complete picture of Hungary as lived through the eyes of his girlfriend's family if, you sense, he had lived there longer and taken time to travel about the nation whose language he's learning. Skilled in languages, comfortable among strangers, skilled with surviving by his wits, you wonder why Hall left evidently for Boston to write the story. Did Zsosa come with him? Did they separate? He dedicates the book to her and notes that he was surprised that she, his &quot;love&quot;, liked it.<br />But this only leaves us wondering what the afterward was to his story, and why he never explains how they met, how he supports himself while spending the mornings at her place writing his account, and why he then returned for home. He may have run out of money, but what about her?A worthwhile book but an elusive and intentionally I suppose--given his obvious attention to detail--circumspect story.worthwhile book but an elusive and intentionally I suppose--given his obvious attention to detail--circumspect story.	2003-02-04

Not a travelogue so much as an extended series of conversations with usually well-spoken people much like Hoffman herself. Not a book for those seeking Romany flavor, hotel mishaps, and quaint lore. She largely conveys her impressions and ideas in a style reminding me of essays for the New Yorker or the Sunday magazine of her own employer The New York Times.<br />Her reflections on Havel's Czech Republic, the still lurking oppressiveness of Romania post-Ceausescu, the Bulgarian-Soviet aura, and the Hungarian cynicism mesh nicely with her own Polish rather aristocratic attitudes (not by birth but by predilection?).<br />While the report's well-written, it does lapse into an over-reliance on the chat in the salon, so to speak, rather than on the street. You feel as if she, naturally attracted to educated dissidents for the most part, wished to relate their stories to us at the expense of a conventional tour of the countries she visits. For instance, little of Slovakia appears, and the sights she describes stick less in the mind than the ideas she ponders.<br />Fine, but fair warning for anyone expecting another Patrick Leigh Fermor (pre-WWII) or Brian Hall (Stealing from a Deep Place, 1988--Romania/Hungary/Bulgaria cycled through from an American's p-o-v). A useful introduction to how politics inevitably must give way to the ordinary, the human, the lived experience. Although she may differ from Havel, Hoffman provides a beneficial Western counterpart to his own thinking. 3 1/2 stars.	2003-02-03

I encountered fewer characters this time, due to his longer stays with people, and, as Fermor admits, he tended to keep to the company of the gentry more than the peasants and Gypsies he originally anticipated.<br />As in the first volume, vignettes stand out: he nevertheless manages to find a Gypsy encampment, Hasidim among lumberjacks deep in the Carpathians, a count who mutters in language out of Robbie Burns about his butterfly collection, and the romance with Angela, discreetly but poignantly narrated. My favorite scene is just before his great romance, when a briefer &quot;roll in the hay&quot; becomes exactly that in the company of Safta and Ileana.<br />Fermor's allusions to his later Crete exploits are tempting--I only wish he had had time to related these too in more detail. His comparisons to 1980s Europe and what transpired to some of his friends later on make for thoughtful and instructive entertainment--the mark of the best writing.	2003-01-28

How does one live with lies? For the revolutionaries, they sought, in K's view, not so much a Western-style republic as a democratically-elected, neutral nation where both reforming Communists and other social democrats and other parties could share power. I found this intriguing, as I'd assumed naively that any Soviet-bloc nation yearning for liberation automatically would reject Communism--at least in 1956. As K. shows, gradually rather than suddenly, the nation edged towards revolt. In the wake of Stalin's death and the encouraging noises made by Khrushchev, Kaposci decided to back Imre Nagy and his allies against the Soviets and their Hungarian puppets.<br />We all know the aftermath, but Kaposci broadens his work to take in the years before 1956, so we fully understand the intrigues that made every move under the Soviets dangerous. What emerges from his account are the evasions that anyone who survived had to pretend as reality each dreary day under such a system--where early hopes had been crushed by mendacity, careerism, and brutality.<br />I wish he had included more about his own resistance against the Nazis, and about the prison life in the years after his show-trial, but these are minor quibbles. What you will find here is a matter-of-fact account of what it takes to be a hero, for K. and his compatriots have the chance to act nobly when so many around them turn traitor. A lesson worth remembering and passing on, as this book provides us with true role models.	2003-01-28

Amazing that a footloose teenager could bring such depth to a grand tour on foot, seeing Mitteleuropa on a pound or so a week and the advantage of lots of largesse from the peasants, fellow tramps, and more noble hosts he meets seemingly without fail.<br />For instance, his dozen pages describing his Viennese pal, Konrad, who speaks in Shakespearean argot picked up from a book of the Bard, are worth more than countless other heftily paginated but intellectually fluffy travelogues; Fermor truly has a knack for meeting the best companions or at least making us and himself believe he's met such on the road! I found his level of past and present exposure to various languages and ability to, say, warble Virgil or Horace as he walked along truly marvelous, if hard to relate to today! The amount of knowledge he packs into these pages can be daunting for those less multi-lingual than himself, and I didn't catch every reference he makes, but that's no fault of his. More four stars for the effort I put into the book showing my ignorance rather than any inability of his to keep me turning the pages. It merely shows the gap between the world from which he came in class, education, and opportunity vs. our own.<br />Especially moving are brief footnotes here and there which comment on the fates of a few of the friends he makes in his German stint; the contrast between his future and theirs only a few years after 1934 adds poignancy and heft to his reflections.<br />Certainly an account worthy of seeking out and making it again better known.<br />Reminiscent in ease of tone, level of learning, and finely crafted style to the books of Arabian and Middle Eastern travel by the current British writer/scholar Tim Mackintosh-Smith, &quot;Yemen&quot; and &quot;Travels with a Tangerine.&quot;-Smith, &quot;Yemen&quot; and &quot;Travels with a Tangerine.&quot;	2003-01-18

Here, with only a month allotted, she manages to combine a travelogue with her own encounters with her relatives and family friends willing to meet with her. Others do not. You feel the tension living in a communist regime here, even one as relatively more open (1980) than others, and I wondered how much of her story she had to leave out for fear of offending those whose conversations she could not have retold at the time of her book.<br />She conveys her journey in a surprisingly well-written account that often relies upon analogy and metaphor. She builds into her visit an examination of the refugee and the stateless condition--why can some adapt and others never can, once removed from their place of birth, she asks herself and other Hungarians she knows from England, where she now lives after a New York childhood.<br />Worthwhile for its thoughtful and evocative analysis. A month usually gives little raw material for a sustained report, but combining her travel with her own recollections and other exile accounts, Porter constructs a non-sentimental, honest, and revealing picture that opens up herself as well as Hungary to the reader.	2003-01-11

Understanding Religions)	Books	4	50	52	N	N	Islam from the soul's p-o-v	A great look at Islam from the \\"phenomenological\\" perspective. Not for beginners, more for intermediate students who've already grasped the general \\"how-to's\\" and \\"where-from's\\" and who, as the authors intend, wish a book that gives the insights of a practicing Muslim imbued with the faith of the heart as well as the facts of the mind. The authors' sympathies seem to be with the former, but as practioners of the latter, they manage to bridge the gap between an inner view and an objective analysis.<br />You can tell that Chittick and Murata have refined much of this material in classrooms--they frequently provide analogies that Western readers can understand, and anticipate objections and confusions predictable from newcomers. I appreciated their sensibility that can teach both those within Islam and those observing it from the \\"outside\\"; they assume that both groups will learn from their fair-minded approach. While a bit soft on the Islamists and their narrow interpetations, they do criticize (pretty late in the book) such limitations, although typically in a gentle, understated manner. It's only fair to notice when this book appeared. My only reason for four stars is because a revised edition would be very appropriate with the renewed interest in Islam and the need for an updated global context.<br />However, most of the wisdom in this study is timeless. My favorite part was that devoted to the Muslim conception of the afterlife and the intersection of good and evil within the power of the divine. Not the easiest topics, but very worthwhile for the careful, patient reader. The attention devoted to these ideas pays off. Over hours spent thinking about the authors' encounter with the hadith of Gabriel, I came away from this book enriched and invigorated.<br />Carefully compiled and meticulously written, the combination of Western objectivity and personal enthusiasm (in the root sense: to be filled with God!) motivates what must have been a labor of love as well as a considerable effort intellectually for the authors to compile. No mere textbook, but no fuzzy inspirational tract, this volume combines scholarship with love and scrutiny.a considerable effort intellectually for the authors to compile.

He sets out how classical and contemporary attempts to plumb a Creator's role and our response to such role-playing are often surprisingly similar.<br />For, unlike the personalized, overly touchy-feely or stern and tetchy divinity models we're confronted with in the mass market (a pun not made by Ward!), he offers us a more distant, more mature deity that we have to make an effort to face up to, who may not necessarily be that bothered about if we mix wool and linen or collect sticks on the sabbath or get into fights over trinitarianism. His book, as another reviewer points out, is not the first place to begin, but makes excellent &quot;intermediate&quot; reading for anyone seeking to meet philosophers who've tried making sketches of a deity more--or less--detailed for the few perhaps unsatisfied with what that &quot;mass market&quot; is given as &quot;God.&quot;<br />My only star subtraction is for the fact that at times Ward seems too self-satisfied with his interpretations, and fails to see how what these erudite thinkers have to say about God has failed and probably will go on failing to find popular transmission and acceptance among many of the less-informed clergy and parents and cultural images who publicize the kinds of images of God we get as kids and often never grow out of. While he alludes to this once in his own preaching (eliding over the context of a passage he cites), I wish Ward could have had some suggestions on how to change this. As it is, his book is like a hidden &quot;egg&quot; in the DVD that a few seekers will stumble upon while 99% of the other players will amble past it-- obliviously. Being at Oxford rather than out among the unlettered hordes, he may place more faith in the consolations of philosophy than the rest of us usually find. Still, one of the advantages of such books as Ward's is that we gain his years of donnish insight and clerical practice even if we missed out on that Rhodes scholarship.<br />And, as Ward points out, if more of us realized how insufficient and patronizing popular conceptions are vs. those of the dons and profs here, maybe we'd all calm down a little in our theological ranting. If only more of us could accept the probability that perhaps we won't live forever, but be subsumed into some numinous essence. Problem is, as Ward shows, it takes some growing up on our part to accept such versions of a God more involved with the big picture than with our little lifespans.

I wanted to read the novel before seeing Scorsese's film; Baker's novel, however, delves much more into the riots than does the film--which treats it more as an anticlimax. The Irish are both sympathetically and mercilessly portrayed by Baker, and I respect his ability to keep you caring about the fate of his intertwined characters--even the villains--until the end. I wonder, given the deserved yet unresolved fate of one key character, if this person'll show up in the final volume of this NYC trilogy?<br />Another reviewer mentioned that there isn't much to relieve the violence. Yet this fits such evocations. We look elsewhere than this novel or Scorsese for slapstick. As Baker's column and novel both emphasize, this NYC is amazingly dangerous. How could one walk one block and survive even before the riots? His  constant and clever parallels (as drawn by his characters) between the famine, slavery, Civil War and street death, and the riots intertwine well these intricate threads into an engrossing read. thankfully, Baker manages to avoid cliche and sentimentality (except where the latter fits their telling of the story, given the characters' own worldviews and expectations).<br />The recollections of the characters offer great set-pieces: Tom's soldiering, Ruth's famine, Robinson's imagined reporting, and notably Billy Dove's adventures on the sea, his holding off the riot at the orphanage, and the powerfully rendered fate of Colonel O'Brien. I think there could have been more substantially differing \\"registers\\" to make the characters' indirectly told narratives more differentiated. Without giving anything away, considering the resolution, I think more liberty could have been taken to dramatize how the story was conveyed through these different figures. Hundreds of pages of musings filtered largely through an omniscient narrator makes for--as in many epic historical novels--lots of detail but a rather plodding form to transmit such rich sources of raw lived experience. Still, Baker's strength lies in particular scenes more than their sum total. As others note, the research weaved into the plot makes history personal and understandable--commendably done and fiction's trump over \\"plain\\" scholarship for most of us casually curious about this period.<br />I also wish an endpapers map had been included for those of us not so familiar with their island terrain. Baker describes it vividly, but it's hard to tell just how far, say, Billy Dove's sewer escape or Dangerous Johnny Dolan's mobleading horde took to criscross flaming Manhattan. My only other suggestion: edit down the final hundred or so pages. Perhaps form meets content here, but as the riot ebbs even as the climax nears, the rising energy of the narrative seems to weary instead of surge.<br />Too bad Archbishop \\"Dagger John\\" Hughes, creator of St. Patrick's cathedral, here is so doddering; for another take on his role in a similarly-staged (Penguin pbk.,1994) novel exploring black and Irish in the same riots, compare Peter Quinn's excellent \\"Banished Children of Eve.\\" I see no credit from Baker to Quinn, but Quinn blurbs on the back jacket for Baker! Taken together with the film, you'll have three, well, violent but sensitive views of famine survival, slavery's victims, prejudice, and the ongoing Civil War as seen from the distance of the already congested, teeming city.through an omniscient narrator makes for--as in many epic historical novels--lots of detail but a rather plodding form to transmit such rich sources of raw lived experience.

Alternating vignettes of natural and inner beauty with harsh violence and chemically-induced ecstasy, Griffith allows Ianto and his mates to emerge here to gain both the sympathy and aversion of the reader. Never straining for sensationalism at the expense of character development, the author sets the figures in a landscape embodying the ancient clash of Welsh native against English invaders while avoiding heavy-handed allegory.<br />Griffith's accounts of raves, drunken binges, and sheer frustration provide an engrossing narrative. I wondered, when reading, if the characters had previous encounters in other Griffiths novels or stories; there's a lived-in quality they share that I found appealing--as if I was eavesdropping on them rather than viewing them as fictional figures. I don't give five stars easily. I suppose only waiting for more astounding heights for Griffiths to climb prevents five stars for a writer at the start of his career.<br />I anticipate his other books will gain greater distribution soon; if there's a trilogy, then it deserves serious attention.<br />Similar to Irvine Walsh, the dialect may slightly put off those wanting a quick dash through its pages; rewarding by its density and wit, this novel kept me eager to return to its pages. Similar to George Saunders' stories, a genuine compassion underlies the sensational surface. Similar to Magnus Mills' novels and Michel Faber's Under the Skin, Griffiths mixes stark settings with nearly symbolic tension overwhelming its visitors.	2002-12-24

Those lucky enough to have read Tim Mackintosh-Smith (or \\"Ahmad Kandash,\\" according to some of his native Arab neighbors) on his adopted land of Yemen (I wish the American press had kept the British subtitle \\"Travels in Dictionary Land\\") will find the same strengths in this account. Outside of, say, an Omani snack of dried shark and Scotch or a jeep bounce, the report from the hinterlands is driven more by insight than ignition. In the manner of many such travellers' tales from more leisurely pens and patient eyes, not much happens in the way of thrills; a subtler, refined retelling of IB's adventure through his own retracing gives a filtered, reflective sheen to the book.<br />I sense throughout an unease with his \\"masahi,\\" or Christian status--with many he meets understandably amazed at his command of Arabic, Tim's constantly finding himself almost apologetic for his \\"infidel\\" status. I wonder if ensuing books (long life to the author so he can tell his journey's sequel--even if he's the same age as me--not that old!) will unfold not only the geographic and personal encounters he tells so well, but his own spiritual struggles. Foreshadowed perhaps in the transcendent dervish dance he witnesses.<br />Anyone who can gracefully cite the apropos Edward Lear allusion, the culinary reference (some of which escaped me due to my parochial palate), or learned medieval reference and still keep a travelogue dynamic and unassumingly witty while avoiding cliche or pandering is an accomplished scholar and a skilled word-smith.  His range of knowledge enters at the right moment, and then recedes; he largely does not show off what he knows. Instead, he sprinkles it into the text to flavor the immediate image or conversation he's narrating to us. Not an easy feat.<br />But the world he enters can never be entirely plumbed by a Westerner; skilled as he may be, this author knows the power of the unresolved detail.

As a native of Belfast and a skilled journalist, he writes without the verve of J. Bowyer Bell or the swagger of Tim Pat Coogan, but his own version of IRA history fills in details previously unreported by mainstream authors or known by the public crucial to a nuanced understanding of how the Provo IRA via SF came to be the acceptable face of republicanism today.	2002-12-12

His Jewish background and interfaith efforts in the Balkans enrich his study. Too often, Christian readers receive in such journalistic introductions comparisons between their faith and Islam, while Jewish readers are often ignored--it's assumed Israeli issues suffice! Many reviews here have pointed out the strengths and weaknesses of his book already.<br />I might add that the attempt to pit Wahhabism against Sufi/Sh'ia interpretations does make for a rather unwieldy combination. So much of the book involves Saudi machinations, and so little by balance opens up alternative versions of Islam. Certainly his sympathies are defended, but the book cannot seem to settle for either a sustained exploration of the narrow Saudi ideology or a convincing insider's defense of the expansive Sufi/Sh'ia messages.<br />Too often, Schwartz seems to rely upon his earlier journalism (and it's not often the Albanian Catholic Bulletin, the Anderson Valley Advertiser [as in that great Boonville brewery!], and the Forward share bibliographical mention). His accounts of the Balkans fragment, and the reader hops with him from noted figure to infamous tragedy without really feeling the depth of the human impact of either war or enlightenment. Likewise, with his Saudi chapters, the destruction committed by the regime against its Sh'ia and other dissident Muslims lacks the telling detail needed for a new reader to this topic to enter fully into what obviously for the author is a heartfelt as well as intellectual issue of the utmost importance. His connecting the Saudi to U.S. academia and think-tanks and mosques is intermittently revealing, but he does not delve in-depth as I expected, say, on Saudi funding of American mosques and centers.<br />Lacking footnotes: he lists many works in the text but without hardly any citations. One must guess from the authors he cites what texts he has quoted from and as for the page references of 98% of what he mentions, forget it. I do applaud his inclusion of URL's and acknowledge his reliance on Net sources, but since the vast majority of his research listed is from traditional print, his lack of scholarly adherence to convention leaves readers eager to find more having to make more of an effort than is customary to do so. He could have put endnotes in for more than a few of his sources--only a handful appear at the back of the book.<br />For instance, he notes Khalid Duran's \\"Children of Abraham: An Intro to Islam for Jews\\" book and some Sufi sources that I found intriguing. But, again, no exact page or even title citations discourage the reader faced in his works consulted with pages of titles and very little guidance. And, as others have noted on amazon.com, why he plays his evident embrace of Sufism up and down simultaneously dampens his credibility. Surely his example would strengthen and not weaken his claim to have both observed the faith he had studied first without and then within to defend what he sees as its proper form. He isn't a dispassionate academic but an involved pilgrim, and I would have liked to have had Schwartz more throroughly blend the two rather than piece together much of what seem to have been his articles over the past decade.<br />What could have been included more often? One example: in a few pages on Marin County and John Walker Lindh, he mixed his Bay Area perspective with a take on Lindh that could have become its own book! I look forward to more from Schwartz, and thanks to his own blending of Western analyst, Balkan-languages speaker, and Sufi practitioner, he brings a rare perspective to the topic.ites what texts he has quoted from and as for the page references of 98% of what he mentions, forget it.

KSR presents people grappling with the big questions over millennia, while integrating into his plot an impressive range of insights from religious, cultural, political, and social history. Happening upon this work in the midst of studying Islam, it arrived at a perfect moment for me. KSR blends an astonishing amount of scholarship into his story but stays for the most part with how ideas have an impact upon the individual as well as the group. Trading off between earthly reincarnations of the \\"jati\\" group and brief scenarios with them yet another time in the bardo, this framework allows readers to learn along with KSR's appealing characters how to better one's self and those around us. Subtly, the characters' views move into more modern and skeptical bases as the centuries go on. Familiar inventions and battles occur, all the while tinged with the difference for us as readers effected largely from \\"our\\" Western-dominated absence from his global narrative.<br />His humanism and skepticism against totalitarian and oppressive systems keep the wheel turning through a well-told tale. You lament the passing of nearly every main character, and the unpredictability of their incarnations adds tension and poignancy to themore intimate scenes. Sometimes, however, too much goes by in one character's long life to make much of it stick except in the more detailed vignettes. KSR's own grasp of historiography makes for great intellectual fodder, but it can be a bit clunky as presented in the latter chapters of the book by \\"talking heads.\\" Then again, these ideas are discussed at academic conferences, so perhaps their erudition and airless quality fits!<br />The blend of Native American, Islamic, Buddhist, Sufi, and Indian mentalities proves a fascinating thought-experiment while Judaism and Christianity have largely succumbed. I would have liked to have had a glimpse of the surviving two other monotheisms and how their remnant fared, as well as a depiction of Zott [Rom/Gypsies], Armenians, and more of the Africans and Aozhou [Australia]. But the book is long enough that you'll be entertained and educated in plenty as it is. His penultimate reflections of teaching in a university much like the one in KSR's own town serve as a thoughtful valediction upon the effect of students upon a professor. Although a bit long-winded in places, this actually adds verisimilitude to a novel concerned with how we wrestle-- stumbling, defiant, giddy, weary or blustering--against the gods' obstacles or the universe's indifference to improve our existence despite the fates and our own inevitable deaths.Armenians, and more of the Africans and Aozhou [Australia].

I've read a lot of books on Irish nationalism--if not as many as Terry Golway has listed in his excellent bibliography!--and I recommend his work as a readable, fair-minded, and well-told introduction to the subject. A  thousand years condensed into a little over 300 pp. of lively narrative;  although about 700 years gets condensed into the book's first few pages.  Most of the concentration is upon the period from the 1700's forward, and  the pace picks up when the 1798 rebellion, the first of many, begins.  Golway's capsule biographies of many of participants gather essential  details and apropos anecdotes to give a brief sketch of many names that  most readers may have only heard a bit at best about before. This panoramic  perspective gives the history a broader scope than other such introductions  to Irish history, and he uncovers factual nuggets about many of the figures  that help the curious reader to keep them easily in mind. Assuming nothing  on the part of the reader in prior knowledge of the period, he writes a  study that at the same time can satisfy those who thought they were already  familiar with these events. Like a good popularizer should accomplish in a  popular history, Golway tells the story with no wearisome editorializing,  no maudlin asides, and no apparent ideological hidden agenda. The facts  speak for themselves, and whet your appetite for more--many further works  can be tracked down through his notes and bibliography. If you're looking  for a place to start yourself or another reader on a journey into the Irish  past and present, it's a great place to begin.	2000-04-16

The urge to demystify the icons of 1916 has been a strong tendency in recent historical studies of this period, and one that many intellectuals and writers in Ireland have espoused--at least in part.<br /><br />Not that such a suspicious attitude towards hero-worship is not wise. It's just that, taken as an underlying motif in Henry Smart's growing-up, it weakens the novel's energy, and saps its cumulative narrative drive.  Doyle describes many incidents vividly (as in \\"Paddy Clarke\\") in specific scenes. He gets down the inner voice of Henry and renders it at times grippingly.<br /><br />Yet, as another reviewer here has noted, you wonder why, if he's so \\"smart,\\" why he does not jump ship for  America even before the British make him a wanted man. He spends the second half of the novel on the run, believing not in the cause but only in his cunning, yet he stays and endures not only the Rising, but the Tan War (and even the Civil War--disappointingly glossed over rapidly in the melodramatic final pages), when I could not understand why he remains so long in Ireland, since he has no loyalty to the ideals or the rhetoric or the future of the Irish nation anyway.<br /><br />I know in my mind why Doyle sets up a revisionist narrator, but as a reader seeking a compelling story, his  Henry fails to prove to me his smarts. Maybe we are meant to regard Henry as an unreliable narrator, but we are not given any other p-o-v to adequately balance against Henry's worldly-wise slum-kid skepticism. The  tale--like its hero--runs out of steam long before it's over. Doyle gives us a young man who can figure out all of his opponent's gambits, but who does not believe enough in himself to win.<br /><br />While attention to this engrossing period is to be commended, and Doyle has read widely while researching the details of early 20c Ireland, his urge to cut down the big figures leaves us with too little to care about. We become as fed up as Henry, and I wonder how the next two volumes will sustain him as he wanders  through America. (Although I know I'll read vols. 2 & 3 anyway!)

Obviously, as with his former book, many  of these tales have been polished in the telling long before they were set  in print. At times, this narrative voice carries you along with an almost  Joycean momentum. Lyrical, swooping, crafted prose. But, as others have  noted, the last third of the book skips about disjointedly; one late  chapter starts in 1971, the next 1969, for instance. You never get a feel  for his wife and daughter--although this may be explained by the pain of  his own divorce, and the difficulty in confronting anew the broken hopes of  his past. The later chapters, after he's established himself as a teacher,  feel rushed and cursory, as if he just wants to hurry up, get to his mother  and father's deaths, and not have to write yet a third memoir with more  detail given from his middle- aged years. The gradual disintegration of a  cohesive narrative thread weakens the total impact of his story. Still, for  the wonderfully described first two-thirds, with its variety of characters,  locales, and stories, it's worthwhile. And he has the best depictions of  teaching in an urban environment I've ever read. 3 1/2 stars.	1999-10-26

Again, Levi  was certainly not the most forthcoming of men, even as he was a writer most  famous for his autobiographical accounts. His wife and children receive  little more than fleeting mention in the hundreds of closely-printed pages,  and inevitably her treatment serves sometimes more as a commentary on the  works of Levi himself than a fresh work. How difficult it must be, after  all, to write the biography of an autobiographer! Yet, having pointed out  some faults, this biography is worthwhile for its picture of the  Piedmontese Jewish community into which Levi was born and returned to; its  explanations of how Fascist Italy differed from Nazi Germany in its  anti-Semitic actions; and most of all how the inner workings of the  lager--Auschwitz-Birkenau--played out in Levi's classic accounts as well as  the larger context of the privations endured by many of his fellow inmates.  Here, the two lengthy chapters on the camp are astoundingly detailed and  intimately rendered, and would make an ideal follow-up to readers who have  read Levi's own descriptions, for Anissimov is alert to what Levi says and  what he leaves out. Apparently the child of refugees herself, the  sensitivity and acumen with which Anissimov describes how and why Levi gave  the famous accounts for which he is justly famed makes her  biography--especially in these two long chapters which themselves comprise  almost a monograph--necessary for those who have first read Levi's own  works. Her book will not tell you much new about the content of these  works, but you will understand better why they were written when in his  career, and why such a reticent man remained so in his own life while his  books spoke for--only some part--of the pain and hope he carried within and  guarded carefully.eticent man remained so in his own life while his  books spoke for--only some part--of the pain and hope he carried within and  guarded carefully.	1999-06-19

Often, the zeal of the  &quot;exiled children in America&quot;, as we're referred to in the Irish  Proclamation of Independence from 1916, has surpassed that of those Irish  we've left behind back home.  Golway's book gives you some of the reasons  why this disparity may have emerged--the force of the Famine, deportation  of many Fenians,  the Civil War's effect in giving unwitting assistance to  many Americans who returned to agitate in Ireland and abroad, and the  economic success gained by a few Irish emigrants and even more the  sacrifices of a few dollars of many many more Irish who did the grunt-work  which fueled the fortunes of those few, no doubt. Today, many of these  emigrants' descendants are criticized as &quot;plastic Paddies&quot; who  know little about Ireland beyond a few ballads and sentimental slogans.  Both their critics and their supporters among the Irish Americans  themselves should study this book, which uses Devoy's long career as a  basis for a complicated study of how factionalism, quarrels, and a somewhat  clumsy mixture of idealism and pragmatism all combined to effect change  back in Ireland. And it should also instruct those who still support the  Irish struggle today--it shows the pettiness and begrudgery that has often  plagued U.S. efforts at grassroots aid. Although at times in the later  sections, I lost track of who was outwitting who in all of the internecine  backstabbing among the various claimants of The Cause, this is not to  discredit Golway's skill. He had an intricate story to narrate, and he  keeps it fresh and even witty, without pandering to his readers. His own  experience as a journalist, a career shared by Devoy, undoubtably enriches  much of the ambiance behind this sometimes reticent figure, too. I often  wonder how a biographer, faced with a subject who's written his or her  autobiography already, can calculate a new angle from which to view the  person. Golway manages to integrate Devoy's own words sparingly, and by  filling in much of the context which Devoy would have kept mum about (or  not known of), the author presents a surprisingly relevant case study of  the dangers and the seductions of trying to achieve an ideal in a messy  world of spies, politicians, revolutionaries, businessmen, and everyday  folks. In a time when many Irish and non-Irish alike are taking a renewed  and justified pride in this island's heritage, this book introduces you to  the American contribution to the Irish situation.

As a posthumous record, this trenchant self-examination by an IRA volunteer from Newry in the 1970s turned--while  in custody and only after repeated resistance--&quot;grass&quot; after  years spent as an Intelligence Officer and then a member of &quot;internal  security&quot; for the IRA gains its veracity from its unflinching look  inside the mind of an idealistic Communist law student. Slowly, he  transformed himself into the director of the &quot;South Down Command&quot;  of a resurgent IRA, whose members carried out under Collins' command a  number of killings of local figures linked (accurately but often  inaccurately) to the RUC local part-time police who aided the British in  the North of Ireland. As Fintan O'Toole, Dublin-based journalist, noted in  an article after the killing, those thugs who avenged themselves upon the  author--by bludgeoning him to death down the lane from his home--only seem  to have proven ironically true what Collins had accused (by naming some  names and barely concealing others in Killing Rage) those who still relied  on such savagery of being--more ruthless brutes rather than principled  fighters for a more just Irish nation. This same nation, throughout its  occupation by Britain, has been often betrayed by informers, and so has  little compassion for &quot;touts.&quot; In a small town where both his  friends and many enemies lived alongside him, Collins' narrative details  step-by-step how his youthful idealism turned into detached, weary plotting  and then killing against others he lived and worked with every day. Trying  to fight British occupation, Collins could not fight his own descent into  bitter self-recrimination. The methods used to resist weakened his inner  convictions; the gap between high-mindedness and low-life executions became  too great, and Collins describes his plunge into self-hatred as he began to  hate others more than love a hope for a free Ireland. Whether writing this  book--as a husband on the dole with a wife and family of four--was an act  of courage or foolhardiness, Collins certainly stuck to his determination  to make amends for his own past deeds and to begin to agitate peacefully  for a united island. Those who silenced him cannot also silence this  disturbing, essential autobiography. Any reader who seeks to understand the  mixture of high motives and sordid practice which has sadly congealed into  the mindset of many IRA volunteers should begin here, with one of the very  few (and undoubtably the best) accounts from an IRA man himself. (It's  instructive to compare his autobiography with those by Ernie O'Malley from  the Irish Civil War of the early 1920s, by the way.) And, as Collins writes  in his preface, we await similar accounts from those on the other side,  those who still fight against one peaceful and united Ireland in the name  of a foreign Crown. Collins' account deserves a careful reading; some may  rashly dismiss it as merely some predestined &quot;death-wish.&quot; Yet an  honest reading of his book argues that all of us who have been involved in  the Troubles must address our own complicity, as we all build a peaceful  and an equitable Ireland as one people--with different traditions but a  basic, fundamental, moral unity.thers more than love a hope for a free Ireland.

Like his earlier &quot;King of the Jews,&quot; this novel also takes on the Holocaust--but this time (with a couple of briefly portrayed exceptions) it's at a distance.  The narrative voice of Peter Lorre as a modern-day Cassandra works interestingly in the early parts of the novel, but by the time the ghost town emerges halfway through the book, Epstein seems to have become uncertain whether or not to stay with Lorre's p-o-v or roam about more loosely.  This distancing from Lorre weakens the latter part of the novel, and it's hard to care for the characters' fates thereafter. Too many players strut about, enter and leave without making enough of an impression in a novel which reaches for a grand statement about Hollywood, the Jewish role, and the Nazi terror. Epstein's best at brilliant vignettes: a Yiddish version of the Dreyfus trial via stock footage shown on a shetl bedsheet and then resurrected by none other than Goebbels; the opening airplane-in-distress scene introducing the dramatis personae; a satirical graveside panorama of Hollywood's Jews and Gentiles alike; the imaginative staging of &quot;Antigone&quot; after the Nazi occupation of Salzburg; and the splendidly conveyed and visually captivating opening sequence of the grand movie which von Beckmann begins to film in the Nevada wastes.  But Epstein's work is stronger in these smaller parts than as its meandering whole, from which at least a third of the book could have been cut and the rest more tightly controlled by its talented but overreaching author. Still, I'm using it for a &quot;Jews and Hollywood&quot; book circle at, fittingly, the Hollywood-Los Feliz Jewish Community Center, and I hope others in our group will record their own opinions about one of the few novels to capture verbally some of film's magical power.	1997-11-03

I liked best the Stahr character (read: Thalberg) when he spins out his fevered visions of how his beleaguered writers could be kicked into inspiration thanks to his ingeniously quirky re-visions (literally) of their hackwork plots.  His narrator--sometimes a female &quot;Hollywood brat&quot;, sometimes a more omniscient p-o-v, swoops in and out between these studio scenes and a somewhat slatternly love interest for the overworked and undersatisfied mogul.  I was reminded of Nick Carraway when reading Fitzgerald's attempts to come to grips with an unfamiliar, fabled-but-hubristic milieu.  Reading it is not an entirely smooth process, but seeing the work-in-progress along with the scaffolding affords a rare glimpse into what might have emerged, in some critics' estimate, as one of his best novels since &quot;The Great Gatsby.&quot;	1997-11-03

Couldn't help but wonder if there will be a sequel, given the ending scene.  It's slow in the beginning, but picks up once Corso's pursuit takes him into the haunts of other collectors of rare and diabolical tomes.  I found myself skimming the Dumas descriptions, and never became engaged by the swashbuckling genre as presented here, but the Eco-like investigation into the demonological world provided for me the book's real pleasure.  And a lust for books energizes this enjoyable intellectual chase.	1997-09-26

The only letdown--the obviousness of a sequel that this story leaves you with.  I guess because I teach both SF and mainsteam literature, that I was hoping for a tighter close to this episode in Fr. Sandoz' harrowing journey--into space and into his soul.  But I look forward to finding out more about the aliens' world--as &quot;ec&quot; wrote in a review above, it's too sketchy as given, considering the build-up to the arrival.  And I wanted more about the supporting crew--after they're all delineated, they seem to be too pat, and their further developments as peers of Sandoz seem not fully realized. The author does better with their earthbound confreres--they gain more depth than those stranded in space, although the latter group doesn't enjoy as much time to muse, I guess! Still, a welcome investigation into religious faith and one that--unlike an earlier Jesuit's portrayal in James Blish's old chestnut &quot;A Case of Conscience,&quot; is fully nuanced and believable.  Having been taught by a few Jesuits myself, I hope that they survive into the next century in better corporate shape than the figures here, caught in all of their idealism, realism, and depth	1997-04-27
