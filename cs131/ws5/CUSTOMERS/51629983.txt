I tend to agree with his conclusions, but I approach my evaluation from another point of view.  It is generally accepted that when a child is born, it arrives with a \\"fundamental mass of life tendendcies\\" that represent the potential of his being.  If one is born into a vital situation inconsistent with those tendencies that cannot be overcome so as to prepare the child to become a faithful contributing member of the society into which it just happened to have been born, there will likely be problems.  I gather that Geo. W. Bush was delivered into a vital situation not entirely compatible with his potential or desires.  One might expect a degree of unhappiness to be the result, at least at first, with all the quirks attendant to the growth process, followed by a search for a crutch upon which to lean, and on which to rely.  He seems to have found it in religion that turned him into George the Evangle. <br />It is our misfortune that now he has accepted the role of the Active Voice with the infalibility it implies that prevents him from recognizing his errors.  He has become reclusive and admant while relying on the advice and support of others to whom he has become close, and in whom he has faith they will not disappoint him.  They have become the filter leading to his throne through which important people must pass to gain entry to the inner sanctum.  Perhaps this is a defense against having to deal with an inferior reality.  Whatever the cause, he has failed the nation by his dogma, and by avoidance may have missed the chance to react before the horror of 9/11.   <br />He demonstrates his hypocrisy by pretending to be God-fearing for the protection of life and nation while he seems not to have any remorse toward the deaths of more than 1000 troops, or the wounds of another 9000 plus who, because of his misguided belief, may lack the benefit that could derive from stem cell research if aggressively pursued.  Perhaps it is because our military is all volunteer, and ought to expect the consequences. <br />I doubt I am doing Dr. Frank any disservice by offering my opinion in my own words as I conceived them as I read his book.  My greatest hope is that the Office will make the man rather than vice versa. <br />Kenneth Ramey,   Paso Robles, CA	2004-12-09

Grant (The American Civil War)	Books	5	28	29	N	N	A man of whom all Americans can be proud	The book is remarkable for its clarity of speech and the simplicity of its presentation, but most of all for the quality of focus of a man whose final chapter is as moving as any I have read, and written just a week before he died.  I recommend that the trilogy of Grant; CAPTAIN SAM GRANT, GRANT MOVES SOUTH, and GRANT TAKES COMMAND, be read first.  Then read his MEMOIRS, and follow it up with ON THE BORDER WITH CROOK.  The characters in the MEMOIRS appear prominently in all the others; men known by Grant from West Point, the Mexican American War, and who served, subsequently, as officers during the Indian Wars following the Civil War.  Connections such as these fascinate me.  Grant's knowledge of his adversaries most of who he knew from experience was perhaps his greatest weapon.  Yet, war being war, he never let let friendship interfere with his duty, which is why he became known as UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER (U.S.) GRANT. it seemed to me the more he got into his work, the better he expressed himself, and his CONCLUSION rose to the level of greatness as a writer.  He seemed the perfect compliment to Abe Lincoln whose policies he hoped to carry forward.	2002-06-29

Because so much of the material is primary source (mostly letters) our perception of the people involved is broadened to the point where we really get to know them.  Adam's son, John Quincy, was the sixth president of the US, but did you know that Jefferson was the third and Madison and Monroe the 4th and 5th, and that John Quincy was followed by Jackson?  Things begin to fall into place as one reads this book, and suspicions are aroused by what is learned.  It is not the sort of book you read and forget, but the sort that leads you on toward a better understanding of why, for example, Burr killed Hamilton at the &quot;INTERVIEW AT WEEHAWKEN.&quot;  JOHN ADAMS is not a book with all the answers, but it surely points readers in the direction of them, by other authors.  It is a book about a decent man married to a wonderful woman, Abagail, during difficult times. I would not hesistate to recommend it to all.	2002-04-08

At first maps were created to fill in the gaps of undiscovered areas of the world.  This is enough to excite the imagination and enthusiasm of anyone with a bent toward histroy.  But, maps are now becoming devices for use by agencies and persons more interested in distribution of ideas, beliefs, and the like. Mapmakers have turned their efforts inward as well as outward, as in the case of the maping of Mars and the Moon, to meet the demands of Social Scientists in what we can only hope will be for the benefit of mankind as before.  There will be hardly a book, be it historical, about art, or science that can be read after reading this one but that relevence will shine through for the benefit of one discipline or another.  Rather than get too involved, however, I recemmend the book be read for the enjoyment of learning.  It is well written and most informative.	2002-04-06

It leaves no loose ends.  She truly is an artist, and her work deserves the acclaim it has received.  I was born in 1929, and raised under difficult circumstances in CA where the districts of the city were like so many small towns woven into a whole. I had little difficulty relating to the text which on more than one occasion brought tears to my eyes.  The unexpected greatness of Lee Harper's work is the universality it reveals in the telling of community generousity, kindness, hypocrisy and lack of consideration that forms the essence of every community.  Most of all, and this is less apparent because of our habitual natures, it is a tale that describes how it is we come to believe in and subscribe to qualities that determine our human and community character.  The community the author describes is generally of one mind, but it has its share of middle-minded folk, too.  The father figure, Atticus, sets the parts at variance as the one character whose uprighteousness opposes the \\"taught\\" hypocrisy on which the community relys, but his means are practiced in such a way as to offend only the most adamant and ignorant few.  It is a drama worthy of the most serious consideration by readers who, if they are wise, will read into it their own shortcomings; concepts based upon everyman's 'secret tyranny' (prejudice) that prevents them from being the \\"free thinker\\" that is Atticus who taught his children more enduring values.  It is how we and our communities change. But, circumstances differ, and each community must deal with them independently. TO KILL A MOCKING BIRD, however, implies the importance of teaching as the means best deserving of the attention of all who would make ours a better world. Those old enough to reflect upon the past can appreciate the progress that has already been made, and be encouraged to help continue the process of setting good examples for generations to come.	2002-02-03

South Georgia Island is in the same latitue nearly as the Falkland Islands. The ENDURANCE left South Georgia December 4th, and ran into ice in the same latitude as Cape Horn on the 7th, just 87 years before we rounded the Horn.  We saw no ice, and the sea was calm.  What a difference 87 years makes.  Yet simply being there helped me to imagine more vividly the grandeur of Shackleton's achievements as a man and a leader.  For nearly two years ENDURANCE'S crew were trapped in the ice, the ship was lost, as shown by Hurley's spectacular images, that put the men and dogs on the flows on which they drifted, with essentials saved from the ship, until months later they landed on Elephant Island.  This is where the real adventure begins, the one that turned failure into incredible success for which the expedition and Shackleton will forever be known.  The rescue required the sailing of a 22' ship's boat across the Southern Seas to South Georgia Island, and the scaling of a mountain range to reach the whaling station on the other side.  Shackleton was at his best, but those who greeted him and his men cried to see him as he was.  His incredible feat, as well as his frustrations, will capture your emotions as few books will. In the end all were saved; no lives were lost.  Still, Shackleton was doomed to die on South Georgia Island while in his mid forties.  He is  buried there, appropriately, it seems, a man whose dream was not to be realized, but who instead will live forever because of the success he had in saving all who shared his experience.  I cannot recommend the book enough to any who have a yen for adventure of the very highest order.	2002-01-27

I read this book without realizing it was the first in a trilogy.  That would explain the odd ending.  As an historian of Spanish/American History, and one who operated a horse ranch in CA for more than a decade, I confess it is authentically written.  Readers without knowing at least a modicum of spanish will find it essential to have a good Spanish Dictionary handy since much of the dialog is in that language.  Parts of the book are exemplarary for its understanding of the cultures involved; southern Texas and Mexican, that exprresses as beautifully as any I have read the concept of the Mexican mind as it relates to the gente de razon as well as ordinary types with whom it would be best to stay clear.  The first part of the book is tedious, but I found myself emotionally spellbound by parts in the latter portion of the work.  McCarthy is a very good writer, and may have touched me because he and I are so close in age, and have had similar experiences.  I would recommend the book to persons with open minds and who appreciate the subtleties of Mexican philosophy as essential to their lifestyle so different from our own.  I cannot say toward what the plot is leading in volumes 2 and 3 since I have not read them; nor do I have a strong inclination to do so.  From what I have read, it  seems to me the title is totally inappropriate since there are so few pretty horses.  I can only presume that the connection will be made in the later two volumes.  The plot, as far as I am able to make it out, is a comparison between two cultures.  Beyond that, I cannot say what value the book offers except that it contains passages of great beauty and comprehension toward the end.	2001-04-01

One such was the Class of 2000/2002 that points out that these graduates have very little direct knowledge of even their recent past.  It only proves that if they are to be enculturated, they must first be taught.  In Plato's day, the means was by oral transmission, the effect of which was to perpetuate what might not be true.  &quot;Memesis,&quot; the total act of representation, that part of of our individual consciousness to which it is designed to appeal, is the area of the non-rational, of the pathological emotions, the unbridled and fluctuating sentiments with which we feel but never think. It is the affect imagery of emotion that hits us directly in the gut before being filtered through the brain, there to be digested before accepted. When indulged in this way emotion weakens and destroys that rational faculty in which alone lies hope of personal salvation and scientific assurance.  Memesis is the &quot;active&quot; personal identification with which the audience sympathies and is enculturated because it is taught.  He who cannot justify his own conclusions cannot be considered a totally educated person.  Still,  there is a need for guidance if the pupil is not to get in over his head and tend to drown rather than learn to swim and particpate for the good of all.	2001-02-28

Beyond that, it is an incredible story of a man who, as did so many before and after him, explored the unknown; such as the Mountain Men of the 1700s and the Astronaughts of the 1960/70s.  The realization that a man walked on the moon and returned to earth in the 1970s exemplifies the immense speed with which knowledge, once gained, can accelerate the speed with which more knowledge becomes known.  Shackleton's exploit has all the spirit and confidence of the crew of the Apollo VII, but on a much more approachable scale.  The rescue of his entire crew that relied upon his success in sailing a small boat across dangerous seas to a distant ilse, then crossing its mountains to get to the whaling station and help, has all the suspense of Apollo VII.  It is enough to have readers shouting HURRAHS by the end.  Yet, it is no more than another of so many experiences where man has taken it upon himself to open their world to others, even at the expense of their own lives.  Fascinating!  HIGHLY REDCOMMENDED.

The theme is devoted to the right of an animal to its territory, and expresses the interesting fact that the possessor is usually the victor if and when confronted with an intruder.  After reading Ardrey's work, I have watched with interest my 17 pound bundle of fluff, chase a much larger dog from our property.  It was no contest.  Just as the one knows his rights and the bounds within which they can be excercised, so too, does the other realize that, as an intruder, he has no right to contest that right.  One needs to keep in mind that man is no less an animal than those studied by Ardrey who, although his writing is good, tends to be a bit tedious until he gets to the point of his discussion; namely, that man is no less territorial than lesser beasts.  Within certain social groups this truth is more revelent than in others.  Immigrants to the U.S. stake out their &quot;turf,&quot; as they say, and woe be to the trespasser, not a few of whom have been killed.  Readers who take seriously what Ardrey reveals should be able to point to areas on earth where his thesis is in full bloom, and is the cause of considerable consternation and death. I would rate the book five-star were it not that it takes awhile for the casual reader to appreicate what is being written.  It is a work which every Secretary of State should read and discuss with the President and membes of his cabinet before allowing the United States to become actively involved in national affairs, which is not to suggest that the U.S. should remain aloof from affairs that deal with decency and terrirotial righteousness.	2001-01-23

The book is named for the principal character, Wetzel, called by Indians &quot;le vent de la  mort&quot; (the deathwind).  The plot derives from experiences recalled by  members of the author's family.  It tells of real people, missionaries and  renegades each vying for the devotion of Indians in Ohio during the  colonial advance westward (late 1700s). It's raw adventure and of historic  value.  Fascinating, exciting, and representative of the time.  Wetzel is  an unforgettable character whose skill as a hunter exceeded that of the  Indians.  It is not a gentle book, but important.  The ending will satisfy  everyone.  Appropriate sequels to the opening of the Ohio Territory would  be 'Captain Sam Grant,' by Lloyd Lewis, 'Lamy of Santa Fe,' by Paul Horgan,  in that order.  Both describe subsequent settlement of Ohio. For those who  would pursue the settling of the further West, 'On the Border with Crook,'  by Capt. Bourke, describes the post Civil War Indian wars, and is a  suitable sequel to 'Lamy of Santa Fe.'	1999-09-27

Two other works should be  read before criticizing this one; THE SPANIARDS, by Americo Castro (search  under the author's name), and THE MALLEUS MALLIFICARUM, found by title.  I  recommend prospective readers read the reviews of these works first, and  then decide if Mr. Roth's descriptions are extreme.  A less direct method  would be to read THE CAPTAIN FROM CASTILE (see the review in amazon.com), a  novel based on fact, but with a fictitious cast of characters and the  expected amount of fantasy. History poses a problem because it can inflame  the mind unless one respects that what is past may no longer be true, at  least in the same sense.	1999-09-22

Because of the intensity of the Spanish spirit and the strength of its culture, what  is revealed is, I discovered, applicable to Hispanic peoples as a whole, be  they of the Old World or the New. Read first the Addendum and Appendix.   They more than hint at what to expect, and provide a reference point from  which to judge more current events, such as the NAZI holocaust, Communist  Russia's banishments to Siberia and, most recently, the Serbian expulsion  of Kosovars. It is a work most suited to the serious student in search of a  deeper understanding of human nature and the development of antagonistic  cultures.  A brilliant work of Spanish History and, because of Spain's  considerable influence at the height of its glory, a must for anyone  familiar with the language, but who needs more cultural insight.	1999-07-26

It is remarkable for its objectivity, its vivacity, and as a lesson of how best to get along with one's neighbors. Eva's recollections as a child and woman are remarkable and is a person easily taken to one's heart. Her considerable life is a valise which contains a portfolio of memories of the most meaningful sort. I would compare her book with Mari Sandoz' Old Jules; both about frontier life, one in the SW, the other in Nebraska. The reader has the added benefit of increasing his or her Spanish vocabulary that reflects the lifestyle in which Eva was raised. Beautifully written.

Without the background, it becomes a source for a lot of misinformation, especially dangerous to those who are hung up  on the subject of witches.  Informed readers who know how to separate out  and distinguish fact from fiction will find the Introductions by Rev.  Summers fascinating, but misleading.  Witchcraft is a fantasy which the  Church converted to its use as it began to lose membeship.  It is not the  world wide conspiracy of evil described.  Because of the Malleus, millions  of persons were killed over a period of three hundred years.  Again, this  is a work for historians and experienced readers.	1999-07-06

After reading Victor Slocum's book about his father,  and SAILING ALONE AROUND THE WORLD, I at first found this work a bit  redundant, but then I didn't understand its intent.  By telling the story  of Joshua's life, Mr. Teller attempts to define why Capt. Slocum  disappeared.  It represents the last of the triad - Victor's book about his  father, the Captain's SAILING ALONE AROUND THE WORLD, and this work.   Together they provide an understanding of a man whose life changed with the  sudden death of his first wife, the only woman he truly loved, who is  buried in the American cemetary in Buenos Aires.

He is not the writer his father was, but his recollections fill out the years of preparation leading eventually to his father's  'sailing alone around the world.' If it lacks the poetic style of his  father, it does refer to his mother and ships owned and sailed by his  father which lends romance(both senses)and understanding to the Captain.   Joshua Slocum was a true man of the sea whose self-taught knowledge made  him capable of deeds covering the gamet of seamanship.  One can not read  the chapter about the LIBERDADE, a canoe of hardly more than 30 feet in  length built in the wilds of Brazil with ingenuity unknown today and sailed  over 5,000 miles to Washington D.C., without a sense of wonder at the  achievment.  If you enjoy success stories, you will love this one which  explains, in large part, the Captain's remarkable success in the sloop  SPRAY.  One other book, THE SEARCH FOR CAPTAIN SLOCUM, completes the triad,  but that is a subject of another review.	1998-11-06

The  scenes conjured by the writer are in no way more graphic than the truth  which a history of the Inquisition can substantiate.

As a 'middle-of-the-roader' he was not much liked by persons with  stronger opinions.  If we recall how nearly Burr came to winning the  presidency from Jefferson, consider how his temperment at the time was  viewed, and note the support he received at his trial, and from whom, the  reader ought to be left with questions which, as a reviewer with a legal  background concluded, creates serious doubt as to Burr's purpose and guilt.  Burr's Americanism is proved by the way he accepted what he knew was  political policy of the day; government condemned individuals rather than  accept blame for filibustering schemes gone awry.	1998-11-05

Both DeVoto and Irving Stone research well the material presented in their books. But, every author is an individual and  his perspective will necessarily differ from others.  This book, as do  other overviews, does a wonderful job of exposing the reader to causes he  may never have considered in the pursuit of Manifest Destiny.  Men to Match  my Mountains is the perfect sequel to DeVoto's two books, 'Across the Wide  Missouri,' and 'The year of Decision, 1846.' More than simply a history  book, it is a kaleidoscope of detail, bits of which will interest everyone.	1998-11-04

I'm a Californian who has seen the entire coast described by Dana.  He has painted a remarkably true picture of that coast still recognizable.  Jackson was president when Dana sailed in 1833.  It was also the age of the  Mountain Men some of whom were seen in CA while Dana was there. In San  Diego Dana met professor Nuttal who taught at Cambridge and was known to  Dana.  Nuttal crossed the continent the hard way, as a naturalist, then  made his way to CA, and eventually returned on the same ship with  Dana to  Boston.  Both Dana and Nuttal, and their respective pursuits, were  precursors to Manifest Destiny.  Their trips also were descriptive of the  times.  Two years after his leaving Boston, Dana returned as an accepted   'foc'sle' sailor, a man cured of whatever ailed him when he left home.  His  exploits are remarkable for their daring.  He never shirked  his duty as a  shipmate. His is a remarkable tale which could only have been told by one  of his character.  If read in conjunction with the landed history of the  time, 'Across the Wide Missouri,' by DeVoto, it becomes a historical  masterpiece significant for its truth, sadness,  and moments of supreme  beauty of expression.	1998-11-03

Gen. Crook had been a calvery officer whose services proved to be of considerable value,  as much for his ability as for his compassion for the Indians.  His job was  to protect the settlers and subdue the Indians by locating them on  reservations.  The author was with Crook during his first and second  Southwest campaigns as well as that of the Northern Plains.  His love for  his commander and appreciation of the Indians made him the perfect writer  for the topic.  Gen. Crook seems the ideal officer for the job, but was  defeated, not by the Indians but Agents assigned, after the army had done  its work, to reservations by Washington.  The book is a wonderful  description of the duty performed by Gen. Crook who, had his system been  utilized, would have led to a better life for all. In the end, Bourke  feels, Crook died of a broken heart. Important history, and a story too  beautifully told to miss.	1998-11-03

Her success is astonishing, as is the respect she retained for a father who on one occasion nearly killed  her.  It is not a book for the faint of heart.  Mother would have been 100  in 1998, and was raised in IA and MN under similar circumstances.  She was  'down' for several days after reading it because she related so closely to  Mari's life. Old Jules was a man of determination and a dream he would not  let die.  His story is of individuals needed to settle the midwest which  was wrested from weather and cattle barrons. You may become emotionally  involved with childhood memories, but you will admire Mari's honesty and  the success of Jule's life.  So real!	1998-11-03

Lamy's initial dilemma, besides getting to his Santa Fe assignment, was to overcome the  politics of Mexican Catholicism, and bend its will to his own. It was not  the good Church defeating evil so much as it was Lamy's determination to  arrange things in their proper order while at the same time creating an  infrastructure to benefit his parishioners.  His monument is the cathedral  at Santa Fe in front of which is a stature to his memory as a man beloved  by all. Still, Lamy shows a natural reluctance to relinquish habitual  authority after retirement.  The Archbishop was a man, after all, but a man  with a calling he was determined to fulfill. Incidentally, when a character  from one book shows up in another unrelated work (Lamy's eventual  successor, in Tucson), 'On the Border With Crook,' it lends co-incident  authenticity to both.	1998-11-03

As a student of Spanish American History, I wonder why this book was not assigned reading when I was in college.  The first part deals with family and youth of a precocious lad whose father saw in the Military Academy the  Chance for a free education for his son.  Grant was a most capable horseman  whose ability was appreciated.  His first military assignments in the  northwest were less than appealing to a man in love, and far from home.   His reputation as a drinker began at this time.  He was a virtual failure  at whatever he attempted to do except crossing the Isthmus of Panama. And  he proved his mettle during the Mexican American War along with other  familiar West Point cadets who would subsequently become famous leaders on  both sides of the Civil War and, later, wars of Indian reduction in the  west.  In Volume One, the boy becomes a man and soldier. But its greatest  greatest contribution is its telling of the Mexican American War and the  attitute of those who fought it.	1998-11-02

Obviosuly, it is an overview, but one that will intrigue anyone who can apreciate what it took  to make America great, and fulfill its Manifest Destiny.  The bibliography  is a storehouse of primary sources which should be read to flesh out this  outline.  Add to the fascination of the topics the skill of the author, and  you have a work of memorable proportions.  You will like it.	1998-11-02

Of all his works, this is the most down to earth.  The others are too 'professorial' as if intended to impress, while this one  simply lays it on the line. Psychology and mythology relate to each other  very nicely, as Mr. Campbell realized when asked to share his concepts with  those of a Psychologist.  Jung was a favorite because of his concept of  Universal Mind.  Contrary to what might be thought, the book is not  anti-religious, but it does explode particular Christian beliefs.  Rather,  it reveals the Universal meaning of 'life' which each community resolves in  its own way, frequently as not, in similar ways.  Boil away the variety of  customs, etc.,and you have the essence of Joseph Campbell's work, and a  better appreciation of man's universal mind.	1998-11-02

Vol. 2, Mexico and the United States. 2 vols. in one	Books	5	21	24	N	N	Most complete introduction to the Rio Grande Valley	This two-volume series was my inroduction to Paul Horgan who became one of my favorite authors.  It is interesting to note he and Frank Waters ('the Man who Killed the Deer') died recently just two weeks apart.  They were  both 92, and among the greatest authors who dealt with the Rio Grande.  Mr.  Hogan's dedication to detail set him apart from Willa Cather whose fame  rests upon her book 'Death comes to the Archbishop,' using Lamy as her  subject.  She rejected the aproach of Paul Horgan who at the time was  writing his own history, 'Lamy of Santa Fe.'  Willa Cather was a novelist;  Paul Horgan an historian, and of the two I prefer the truth.  Anyone  interested in the history of the Rio Grande will be delighted with Paul  Horgan's two-volume introduction to it.	1998-11-02

Josiah Gregg was preceded by Mountain Men who explored the area, but he was  the first with sufficient education to describe the people, land features  and Indians with whom traders would have to deal. His work constitues a  PREFACE to other books dealing with the Santa Fe Trail and its growing  interest to the United States.  Independence, MO, and Fort Smith and Van  Buren, AR. - were the northern and southern starting points for Santa Fe  respectively. The book is as much a tale of encounters as it is a  repository of valuable information.  A 'FIRST READ' for persons interested  in Santa Fe and the Westward Movement. Another of a variety of fascinating  histories of the Southwest.	1998-11-01

Books	5	32	37	N	N	Primary Source tale of a honeymoon on the Santa Fe Trail	Magoffin was a name familiar to the Mexicans who had trading relations with Susan's husband for years before he married her and took her with him from the states on an expedition to Chihuahua, Mexico.  She kept a diary  from which she drew her information for the only book I know written by a  woman, young and pregnant, whose fate it was to die in her 26th year, at  home. Accounts from her perspective at such a crucial time in relations  between the United States and Mexico, in a venacular peculiarly her own,  make her work one of considerable importance to the serious student of the  time.  Revealing also are individual encounters with men, some from her own  country, and her opinion of Gen. Stephen Watts Kearny, commander of the  U.S. Army of the West stationed in Sante Fe. Susan was a young lady of  class the exercise of which makes the reader proud, and whose elegance  charmed all who came to know her.	1998-11-01

Books	4	6	6	N	N	Attempt precisely to reconstruct the expedition' course	Following the Louisiana Purchase, Jeferson sent out expeditions to explore what the United States had bought.  Pike's Arkansas Expedition was concerned more with the southern extent of the purchase than was that of  Lewis and Clark, but it was not less important. Pike reported directly to  Gen. Wilkinson whose reputation as a double agent involved in the Aaron  Burr conspiracy, lends spice to an otherwise ordinary expedition.  It is a  good beginning for further study on the subject of Mexican/American  relations in the first decade of the 19th century, and an inducement to  read other books about Zebulon Pike as explorer.	1998-11-01
