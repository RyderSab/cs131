It was an excellent read.  I am not really a fan of Brooke's and have not suffered from ppd, but was interested to hear what she had to say.  She can thank Tom Cruise for my interest.  He should only be so eloquent in his speaking as she is in her writing. This would probably be a big help to others suffering from depression of any kind.  She gives hope that there is a way back to \\"normal\\".	2005-07-05

She is remarkably believable.  I did not watch the trial and tried to avoid news reports of it.  This was a quick one day read.	2005-05-12

The depth at which she is able to describe Charles' heartbreak is so true to life.  There are still a few trademarks of the author in here though, \\"Little one\\" is a reference I find in most if not all her books I have read.	2004-10-07

Neatly written, following along the lines he describes in the story of Ray's obsession with neatness and order.  I liked this story I could not put it down without thinking, I need to see what happens next...I like the book size, nice, neat and comfortable to hold.	2004-05-21

My son saw me reading this and broke out in hysterical laughter, saying, &quot;Mom, you're never going hunting!&quot;<br />Good story but I don't get why the part about the family that lived below Jane at her aunt's condo is included in this book?  I thought she would come back to that relation but never does, and it's never explained how it related to the rest of the story.  And what happened to Archie?  Lots of loose ends, but I particularly liked how she wrote the last section with the two authors speaking to Jane as if they were actually her straight talking girlfriends right in the room with her.  Interesting.	2004-03-03

I read 14 pages and was so disgusted I had to throw it in the trash bin.  What a shameful way to use our favorite author's name.  It was not funny unless you're a 14 year old boy.

I don't see what all the hype is about, I didn't find this book life changing.  But it was a good story, I read it straight through in one day. A great book for a sitting on the porch rocker read.

He was so deeply affected by The Snow Goose reading by his teacher as a child that he had to pursue the geese.  A quick 30 minute read,  days later I find myself still thinking about this short story.  Touching and haunting.	2003-04-28

I found myself laughing out loud and shouting YES! Oh my, Craig Wilson has finally put into words what makes one so happy in life.  I LOVED the Sweet corn story.  So much so, that I had to read it out loud to my husband.  He laughed too.  Probably because we can so relate to that one.  And the Clothesline, Oh lord let me die face down in line dried sheets...lmao.  Right on, hit the nail right on the head.  The camping chapter will help me explain to my dear mother in law why I will NEVER be at the family reunion campout.  Roughing it is a tub with no jacuzzi and that's as rough as I get.  Hysterical laughter could be heard over the Italian vacation with mom.  USA Today must thank Craig Wilson for my subscription.  Reading his columns should be listed as one of the simple pleasures in life.	2003-04-12

A good try at trying to be wise and give wisdomly advise.  Think Sarah is finally realizing what it is to be an adult woman in today's world.

This was the best \\"Single girl looking for love and success\\" book I have read so far.  I love the genre, but this is by far the best.  The ending was excellent!<br />To add to this read, I recently watched the made for tv ABC family movie based on this book.  Stayed very true to the book and the lead actress, Charisma Carpenter fit very well in the role of Jane as did the actor who played Ethan.  Nice Sunday afternoon snuggle up movie.	2003-03-04

But nothing that happens is too spectacular or so extraordinary that a bestseller is written about it.  Seems like everything that this story has, has happened to me or someone close to me.  Hmmmm...maybe I should write a book.  However, am looking forward to an opportunity to see the movie, if only for Ioan Gruffudd.  Hope it comes to the US.
