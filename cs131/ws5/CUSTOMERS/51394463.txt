This book also contains a few original games by Sackson, including the wonderful Card Stock Market game, which was later sold in boxed form as Black Monday.

Somewhat text-heavy (as programming books tend to be), it still contains a number of good illustrations and screenshots to effectively teach you. The first three sections cover the fundamentals of Excel and VBA; the next three deal with programming and development topics such as user forms, pivot tables, and event handling; the final section covers miscellaneous issues like compatibility, file manipulation, and class modules.	2001-12-31

A section on storms, for instance, shows how the elements randomize success: in the 12th century, a typhoon ruined Kublai Khan's attempted invasion of Japan, yet relatively calm seas helped assure the Allied victory on D-day hundreds of years later. Another chapter compares and contrasts the dense forests of the Battle of the Wilderness during the Civil War with the intractable jungles of Vietnam. One lesson this book teaches is that bad weather usually favors defenders: the Germans used fog and precipitation to their advantage during the Battle of the Bulge, as did the Viet Cong during the siege of Khe Sanh. The authors draw a few predictable conclusions--planning, logistics, leadership, and tactics are all critical, they say--but on the whole they provide a fascinating look at how wind, clouds, waves, rain, snow, mud, sand, heat, hills, mountains, and islands (to name a few factors) affect war.	2001-12-31

The writing is weak and filled with cliche's.  Very implausible, mildy interesting, ridiculous characters.  None of the characters in this book seem real, the author did a poor job creating them.  Mostly they are super characters able to do everything (the mark of a poor writer) or are just immoral and boring.  The women are all [prostitute]..., the men are all tough, blah, blah.  This is the kind of work I'd expect from Puzo if he were 14.  I think its just an attempt to cash in on his name, rather than a serious attempt at a good story.<br />I'd advise you not to waste your time with it.	2001-12-31

The section on ethics is naive and pathetic.  The idea that because one has a software engineering license one is good is misguided.  You can force someone to learn a few things including the basics of a discipline, but you can't ensure they are competent.  The idea that a person would be legally responsible sounds like a way for corporations to pass the buck and evade responsibility and have a convenient fall guy.  If I were a corporation and a &quot;licensed software engineer&quot; started making waves I'd politely but firmly explain the relities of the world (I'd threten to fire him if he didn't tow the company line, bureaucrats are easy to replace).<br />Whats needed is a broad recognition that software engineering is a discipline that should be required by CS majors and MBA working in an information science area.  <br />What really needs to happen is upper management needs to be held accountable for their mistakes.  Having a &quot;licenesed software engineer&quot; wont mean a thing.<br />The book offers little of practical value, other than a brief description of CMM and some general common sense ideas.  For the money its of little value.  I'd suggest Rapid development instead.  Its much longer, but has real meat.	2001-12-05

Then after a little experience I read this one.  Don't read it too early in your career because a lot of it will just wash over you.

He took hundreds of books and distilled  their essence into a 600 page masterpiece.  He was brilliant.<br />This book on the otherhand is makes some outrageous and plainly stupid claims.  The solution to bad software management is to require computer science majors to take software engineering and design classes, as well as offering much better Software amd Information Systems Management courses at the MBA level.  People learn from each other, and if Harvard and MIT present well trained MBAs who understand the concepts of Rapid Development (read just 1 extra book) we will be on our way to an improved software development process. <br />Instead the author is deluded and thinks requiring licencing is the answer!  As he describes it it will be a cloised group, tough for new people to break into.  Sounds terrible.  Plus a licence just shows that you have some book knowledge and know some procedure definitions, it doesnt mean you can produce good code or run an effective department.<br />His approach will lead to much more overhead and red tape and cost with a slight gain in effectiveness.  Instead if we all were taught the contents of Rapid Development in Business School and as Comp Sci majors productivity would rise at little cost.  For example.  A price who has a license is still going to crush morale.  But someone who has read Rapid Development will understand that what drives programmers is different that what drives managers and treat them accordingly.  An effective manager can get a lot more out of his/her people than a price with a licence.<br />I hope this book is an aberation and McConnell comes to his senses and drops this crap and instead returns to old form and produces another classic.<br />Let me save you your money and summarize the book:<BR>&quot;Many companies have poorly run software departments.  They are inefficient and costly.  The solution is to require Software Engineering Licencess that only a few people will be able to get because of onerous restrictions like many years in the industry and personal recommendations of 9 licensed software engineers'<br />Bunch of crap.  Those chosen few will want to protect their jobs, and knowing how important their recommendations are can exact a huge price from someone.  &quot;Work like a dog for low pay for a couple of years and I'll recommend you&quot;.<br />Skip this dud and read Rapid Development.	2001-09-08

This was a complete waste of ....  <br />First of all, ... for 140 pages is a ripoff, compared to the other XP books in the series which have almost double the pages.  Probably they could get away with it because the 2 authors are widely known.<br />Second, this is a subset of whats in Extreme Programming Installed.  XP Installed is a great book and explains everything covered in this one and more.  This book had about 10 pages of additional information that XP Installed didnt.  ... for those 10 pages is pretty expensive.<br />Third, Considering the books short length, its further anoying that almost a third of it was just a rehash of what XP is.  The real content of the book was maybe 90 pages, and even that has lots of blank pages, end of chapter white space, etc.<br />Save your money, and dont buy this book.  Instead read XP Installed.

I was looking forward to this, despite some misgivings from the bad ratings it got, and boy was I disappointed.  Some of his points are interesting and valid in isolation (the first section, about 30 pages was ok), but he's full of hot air (and himself) when drawing conclusions.  He thinks that because certain professions (Doctors, Healthcare workers, ) are licenced then so should software engineers.  He doesnt seem to realize that those professions involve public safety.  He writes that software thats written that affects public safety should have someone that can be sued.  Sounds like an easy way for a company to find a scapegoat and avoid liability.  He pays lip service to the SW-CMM but doesn't seem to realize that even a good sofware engineer is going to have to do what he's ordered.  He wont be told to hide a safety danger, but he'll be rushed and not be able to design well.  I can see the usefulness of certification in a language like Java, to help in the interview process.  But the concept of requiring a licenece for a software engineer is just plain stupid.  I was so disappointed with this garbage, I just can't beleive its the same author...	2001-07-18

I don't think so. I am tired of the bloated technical books. Our time is too valuable. <br />Its comprehensive, well written, full of examples, and actually FUN to read.  Very rare for a technical work.<br />&gt;Second, the examples are bad and explanations are horrible. <br />No the examples are comprehensive and excellent.  Very helpful for some of the Swing/AWT classes.<br />&gt;Note how the authors explain how local anonymous inner classes should be avoided and then use them in every example afterwards. <br />In general Anonymous inner classes should be avoided, but small ones are ok, and the authors give an example.  If you dont want to make the class anonymos then dont.  Its just an example, and they explain all you need.<br />&gt;Notice how OO principles are disregarded in the first big example.<br />No I didnt notice, they do an excellent job explaining OO principles.<br />&gt; Notice how the chapter on inheritance talks extensively about reflectivity which has only tangential bearing. Also, there is a lot of &quot;This doesn't work here, but don't worry about that now&quot; and &quot;I know we didn't bring this up yet, but you will see this 5 chapters on&quot;. It's called forethought - try it!<br />No its called complesity.  Rather than assuming the readers have extensive OO experience they provide some background.  To throw in everything would be too complex at the start.<br />&gt;Third, too much time spent on GUI topics.<br />I disagree.  Its an important subject and complex.  To spend less time would be worthless.  I found the GUI coverage to be good, and bought the 4 volume set to get complete coverage.  <br />&gt;This takes up nearly half the book. I have to buy the equally bloated Volume 2 to learn enterprise programming.<br />The combined books are 1500 pages.  GUI takes up a chunk, severalhundered pages.  Skip it if you dont care.<br />&gt;Forth, no diagrams. Perhaps a sprinkling of UML would help understand what is going on.<br />I had no problem understanting what was going on.  Well written, lots of examples, and screen shots.  Far more useful than some diagrams.  Not everyone knows UML either.  Spend a few minutes reading the code examples and its easy to follow.<br />&gt;Fifth, the authors do not concentrate on the basics.<br />Sure they do.  After reading the book I had an indepth understanding of many aspects of Java.  They cover all the Basics, but in depth.<br />&gt; The authors rather give you some code so you can say &quot;Look what I can do!&quot;. In a book so large, I would expect to gather a sound understanding of how everything fits together. Where are the examples of Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues? <br />They cant give examples of everything, use some of the classes they give you, don't reinvent the wheel.  Look at Suns website for examples of code.<br />&gt;Juxtapose this with a typical C++ book.<br />This is more interesting and fun.<br />&gt;Sixth, there should be a reference to programming style. <br />Just observe how the authors code.  The book cant cover everything.   They do explain about writing good code.  The dont mention indenting with spaces rather than tabs, who cares.<br />&gt;Instead I have to get the official short document from Sun's site. An excellent source.<br />&gt;I expected a lot more from a book from Sun.<br />This guy must work for Microsoft.  Its one of the best technical books Ive read.

Also, it glosses over some of the advanced topics.<br />Even so, it did the job and I learned PERL.<br />If you are a beginner this book should be ok.<br />I don't think the O'Reilly PERL books are good for learning PERL, only as references.  The PERL Cookbook is pretty good, with some useful examples.	2001-03-21
US	51394463	R3466X8I1QJPM6	1565922840	658971757	Learning Perl, Second Edition (Nutshell Handbooks)	Books	1	7	12	N	N	Awful	I see a disturbing ternd by O'Reily of pumping out books that are not well done. I consider this a terrible book.  Its poorly organized, skips over many important topics, and among the worst books on Perl Ive seen.  My gut impression was it took them about a month to write it, just a rush job rip off of programming Perl.<br />A beginner should avoid this book.  Learn Perl from another book and use Programming Perl as a reference.  The Cookbook is good too.<br />Avoid this book, its a waste of money.  Its the worst languages book Ive seen in a while.	2001-03-17

US	51394463	R10G3B1A2SMIN9	1887901159	634024522	How Robert E. Lee Lost the Civil War	Books	3	5	19	N	N	armchair quarterbacking is easy	Lee did make many mistakes.  But the author desn't realize that the Viet Cong in Vietnam were differnt from the average US citizen.  The confederacy didnt have the military knowledge we have today, 115-145 years later.  Hindsight shows all their mistakes.  So what?  How would a goon general  have performed then, with limited knowledge?  Lee made mistakes, but the  other senior southern generals were pretty bad.  What would they have done  had Lee sent them some reinforcements?  Does anyone honestly believe Joe  Johnston would have been able to save Richmond if he had an additional  15000 troops?  Had Lee not attacked during the 7 days abttle and broken  McCellens will, Richmond might have fallen by siege in 1862 or 1863.  Lee  did make mistakes (Gettysburg) but would any other general have done  better?<br />The entire southern war strategy may be faulty, and thats not  just Lees fault.  Could the south have conducted massive Guerilla  resistance?  What would the norths reaction have been?  Were that many of  the southerners willing to fight that type of long protracted war?<br />The  book is ok, but the author is unfair, and anyone with a deep understanding  of the Civil War sees this.<br />Read some of JFC Fullers books on the  subject, such as the Generalship of US Grant.	2000-06-23
US	51394463	R3U4XQYCJFQ6JO	0521297931	727926923	Supplying War: Logistics from Wallenstein to Patton	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Eye opening - gave me a new understanding of war	I never realized the importance of supplies in war and the difficulty in obtaining them.  Not just food, ammunition, POL, and equipment, but the small over looked things that are critical.<br />The book touches on a wide  range of topics and is a must for the student of military history.  For  example the author covers baking of bread for 17th+18th century armies, the  effects of weather (freezing rivers), the use of trains (you can't just  dump supplies off a train, you need a depot).<br />Its a little dry, but worth  reading and inexpensive as well.	1999-11-30
US	51394463	RYKR86617LLJQ	0812909852	315130508	Korea: The Untold Story of the War	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Very good coverage of the political aspects of the war	Very interesting coverage of MacArthur and Truman. Excellent sections on the diplomatic maneuvering by both sides, as well as the UN and keeping the alliance together.<br />My only regret is the book was rather light on the  military operations, esp. after the Marines extracated themselves from  Chosin.  <br />Well worth reading.	1999-11-30

I never realized the importance of supplies in war until reading this book.  It covers a wide range of topics and is invaluable for broadening  your understanding of military history.  Its relatively short, a little  dry, and a bargain.	1999-11-17
US	51394463	R1AYJCYCASWXRK	0380727420	752513024	Hazardous Duty	Books	3	9	10	N	N	Average - no where near as good as About Face	The book is ok, but not great.  About Face was excellent and I was expecting something more.  While I did learn from this book, and it was a worthwhile read, there wasn't enough substance.  There was a bit too much  about Hackworths exploits in getting the interviews, and not enough  analysis.<br />The contents of the book could have been summarized in 25  pages.  It wouldn't have been as entertaining but it would have been a much  faster read.<br />The book was an enjoyable read, but I wanted more analysis,  and less story telling.	1999-11-10
