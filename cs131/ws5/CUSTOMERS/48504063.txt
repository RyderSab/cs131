In this book, our villain/hero Fade has done some bad things.  He is a sympathetic character but he does kill people which is not socially acceptable even if there is good reason.  As a result we watch his work with his old friend Matt Egan and his strange relationship with Karen Manning with interest.  How can it end.  We hope for a happy ending.  Fade is a good guy even if he has tried to kill an evil government functionary. <br /> <br />As I write this I am raising my grade to 4 stars because even if there can not be hoped for ending it is a fun read.  It is my first Kyle Mills and I will read some more. <br />	2005-10-03

It is interesting to write a review of a mystery so much after finishing the book.  What stays with me is the character development.  Matt Hunter is terrific character.  Portions of the book were far fetched but on the whole it was great fun.	2005-09-06

I only read it on the weekends relaxing on my porch and was always anxious to reacquaint with the young man who would become FDR.   It is a testament to this biography that after reading almost 800 pages I was sorry to see it end. <br /> <br />With all this praise one might think that I understood FDR.  I finished this book no less able to draw a conclusion about the man who would lead our country through two of its greatest crisis.  Question abound in  my mind that probably can never be answered.  The first and most difficult question is what was so special about this man that he could lead.  As this book points out he was not a giant intellect,nor a hard worker or even a visionary.  Somewhat like our current President he muddled through his youth.  Most of what he accomplished was a result of his family name.  The easy answer is that polio changed him.  That is not satisfying when it is recognized he is nominated for Vice President before he got sick. <br /> <br />I remain uncertain and Mr. Ward does not really help in answering the unanswerable other than possibly in his prologue.   From reading this book one might come to the conclusion that FDR did not really relate to anyone.  He lived a distant life from his wife and children.  Possibly it was only Lucy Mercer who reached him.  He was dominated by his mother but even there he was independent. LOuis Howe and Missy Le Hand were totally devoted to him but it does not appear he spent much time with Missy when she become ill. <br /> <br />His battle with polio is beautifully told.  I take away from that his ability to be optimistic and positive against all odds.  He showed perserverance but only really when his ambition was involved.  Yet even in this case he chose to spend his time in Warms Springs somewhat removed from the other visitors and did not spend time with him family.  <br /> <br />As the above review shows, a First Class Temperment is a wonderfulbook because it presents the subject in tremendous detail.  It does not draw conclusions.  Mr. Ward introduces us to FDR in transition.  We meet him and see him grow.  We see what kind of president he will be. I admire FDR.  I am not sure that I like him much.  I know I loved the journey and thank Mr. Ward for setting it out for us. <br /> <br />I hope that Mr. Ward will read the review and maybe indicate what he thought of his subject.  Maybe he will even write the next volume.  <br /> <br />For me I will continue my education by rereading No Ordinary Times,  Conrad Black's biography and Arthur Schlesinger\\"s 3 volume set.  I doubt it will answer any of my questions but I look forward to the experience.  <br /> <br />Geoffrey Ward thanks for the experience. <br />	2005-09-06

As other reviews have indicated this is not intended to be a complete biography but rather information gleaned from a review of the archives of Justice Blackmun <br /> <br />LInda Greenhouse focused mainly on three topic.  The first is the ending of a friendship between Justice Blackmun and Chief Justice Burger.  The two men grew up together.  Burger was the leader bringing Justice Blackmun with him.   When Justice Blackmun arrived at the Supreme Court he slowly became his own man and the friendship falls apart.  In her reliance on the Blackmun papers only we can only see one side of the fissure but even that shows when old friends go their own way it often is done by small slights that in each detail is irrelevant but together are significant. <br /> <br />The second theme is the change in Blackmun\\"s  attitude toward the death penalty. In small steps the responsibilities of the Court required Blackmun to more fully understand the implications of the penalty until finally he no longer could support it.  Again the change is beautifully detailed and we feel from his writing as portrayed by Ms Greenhouse the depth of the change.  In this portion of the book we learn how difficult it is to predict how sitting on the Court will change people.  As we see the selection process for a new justices begin we should remember that people do grow with responsibilities and not to be to quick to characterize a nominee. <br /> <br />The last focus and the most detailed portion of the book is the identification of Justice Blackmun with the Roe decision which he wrote. Starting from the beginning of the research at Mayo Clinic the focus of the decision was the protection of doctors.  As Blackmun developed his view he became more concerned about the rights of woman.  Roe became his legacy and he worked hard and even stayed on the Court longer to be sure the case was not reversed. <br /> <br />The book also provides a wonderful insight on howthe Court operates.  Justices that have different views are friendly.  The letters and the notes between the justices are fascinating.   <br /> <br />The theme is the change in Blackmum as he served.  The lesson is that as we watch the Court we forget that the justices can change and that there is enormous pride in the institution.   <br /> <br />In summary this is a wonderful book by an author who obviously respects her subject	2005-05-14

The interesting part of the book is watching Dan Brown begin to develop his craft.  I have now read all four of his books and in some degree they are all similar but they improve.  Each is researched, although according to several reviews the research in this book is spotty especially as it relates to number theory and Spain. Each takes place in a long day.   In each the conclusion is reached just on time.   <br /> <br />Digital Fortress is not nearly as interesting as the others.  Also the plot is even more far fetched than the later efforts The characters are not as interesting  <br /> <br />All in all it was worth reading because it shows how someone who has become a master started.  I have  read that Mr. Brown is having trouble finishing his next novel. Maybe he is concerned that he has reached his peak and does not want to just mail one in as other authors such as Grishom have done on occasion.  Maybe he also has realized that he has hit his peak.  In any event it will be interesting to see what he does produce next. <br /> <br />In rereading this review I see I have spent more time talking about the author than the book.  After thinking about the Digital Fortress that is an appropriate comment. <br />	2005-04-24

The demise of Enron was the direct causation of the Sarbanes Oxley Act which redefined how public corporations must act.  When one reads through Eichenwald's book it becomes clear why reforms were needed.  Enron was a company that was totally out of control.  The environment starting with its compensation method focused on the deal maker and did not even think about the basic elements of corporate control.  Nobody cleared transactions.  Nobody understood what had been agreed to.  All of these weaknesses are discussed in the book very well <br /> <br />Eichenwald clearly identified the good guys, the weak guys and the bad guys in the book.  Andy Fastow was the evil man.  He seemed completely motivated by greed and totally acting for his best interest.  He is portrayed as a liar and a crook.  <br /> <br />Jeff Skilling is the most interesting person in the book.  He is shown to be brillant and creative.  On the other hand he seemed totally unfit to be the COO of anything.  It is hard to understand how he could have trusted Fastow in the position he was in. As Enron began to collapse it appears that Skilling becomes mentally ill.   I find it hard to believe that Skilling did not understand what was happening.  Sometimes the person who should know and turns his back on the activity is the worst. <br /> <br />Ken Lay the last of the big three is portrayed as a glad hander who just wanted everything to be okay but brought nothing to the party.  I am waiting for his trial because it again appears to be hard to believe. <br /> <br />There also are heros who stood up for the shareholders.  People who left or fought the good fight such as Jeff McMahon and Kaminsky.  The problem with this type of book is that one wonders who spoke to the author.  There may have been some special pleading.  <br /> <br />Having said all of the above the important point is that this is a great page turner.  The style is engaging.  The author does not spend too much time trying to explain the complex financial transactions, but focuses on the human story.  It is a great read and will be the landmark book on this sordid subject.	2005-04-11

Without reading other books in the series a portion of the book is lost because the incident that colored the behavior of Dis and Abe is not understandable.  For this effort to be completely enjoyed the past history should be understood. <br /> <br />Having said that most of this is a good read.  I do not want to give away too much of the plot but the twists and turns before the ending are fascinating.  We watch the story unfold through deductive reasoning. Dis is a compelling character who shows human weaknesses.   <br /> <br />There are a few quibbles.  It is hard to understand how the illness of Abe's son fits in the story.  Also I think the ending was a bit far fetched.   <br /> <br />	2005-03-22

As many other reviewers said the discussion of Bologna was fun, especially because Grisham loved the city.  Plot was not believable or even important.  <br /> <br />The book was totally lacking in suspense and was far fetched.  The saving grace is that the book had no pretense.  It was just a pleasant diversion on two plane trips.  I am not sure how one rates.	2005-02-27

This book is a wonderful example of the development of a character and the changed perception. The first hundred pages of the book paint a picture of Rennel as a generally horrible character.  He certainly seemed the unrepentatant killer of a little girl.  There is no doubt in my mind that Rennel deserved to die <br /> <br />However, as we see Rennel develop we begin to understand what actually happened. Our perception of Rennel and even his brother Peyton change and our sympathies shift.  The lesson is clear that it is easy to understand how emotion can color judgement.  Also there are many figures about capital punishment set forth that make it very difficult to favor this form of punishment.  <br /> <br />Mr Patterson is a wonderful story teller but sometime the polemics block the progress of the story.  Also when the Supreme Court get involved it is easy to see the Judge Scalia stand out. <br /> <br />A criticism is that Mr Patterson is often guilty of overwriting as well.  Also the Paget family is just too good.  These foibles do not really slow the progress down. <br /> <br />The plot is very similar but not quite as good as Reversible Error by Scott Turow which I read several years ago.  If you have not read it I suggest you compare the two. <br /> <br />	2005-02-23

I unfortunately agree with the negative reviews.  The first segment of the book is wonderful.  Without giving away any plot the train ride and the scenes in LA are riveting.  If the book had ended there I would have given it a 5 star.   <br /> <br />The remaining portion of the epic is not convincing, wordy and boring at times. I continued to read this portion because of the momentum of the first portion.   Also it was interesting to try to figure out exactly what was happening.  This was resolved mid way through the second portion.  From about 450 onwards the story dragged.  I found the end unsatisfying.   <br /> <br />The question that is touched on better never really explored is the moral dilema that was faced.  In the 700 pages more should have spent on this issue and less driving in a never ending snow storm.	2005-02-14

I spent the second part of my vacation reading The Narrows and I must admit I was wrong.  The Narrows is better on all accounts.  <br />Harry Bosch continues to be a compelling hero.  He unwinds the mystery but a brillant intuitive mind matched with hard work.   Connelly is comfortable bringing in past history, even the movie version of his past book.  Giving the characters life, especially Terry McCabe adds reality, which makes the book even more chilling.  The characters are terrific, there is not a missed beat. Harry is human.  I felt for his love for his daughter and his indecision about returning to the force.  This was all in retrospect As I was reading all I could do is turn the pages as the book was so exciting. <br /> <br />Michael is the best there is.  We can only celebrate that Harry is going back to the police force and we will see more of him.	2005-01-06

The interesting part of these books is that the stories are all basically the same.  Brillant psychotic killer who needs to play with the protaganists are featured.  Murders are creative and send a message. Close calls abound and most times the killer is discovered just as he is about to commit yet another heinous murder.   <br />Yet with similarities some books work and others do not.  The difference is that the characters are interesting. Sean and Michelle, the detectives, who we met in Split Second mix well. They also are very clever. We watch their friendship grow.  The killer who narrates several chapters is fascinating and even though he kills he has a soft side, which may have been part of his undoing. <br />I stayed up too late reading this.  There are criticisms that parts of the story are not believable.  All I can say is that it is only a story.  That is so but is a really good one that should not be missed. <br />	2004-12-30

Like so many thrillers this one brings strong emotions on each side-- some were enthralled and others bored.  I am a big DeMille fan and enjoyed Up Country and the previous Corey books.  As in those, the writing is fun.  The difficulty with this book is that it seems that the story was a way used to put forth a theory.  The last third of the book was actually silly and the ending was unacceptable. <br />The conspiracy theory is always dangerous but especially as in this case when there does not seem to be any motive for the conspiracy.  Maybe there will be a sequel when a reason for the alleged conspiracy can be explained.	2004-12-18

The book construction is clever but neither story reaches the level that we are used to.  I have read more of Jonathon than Faye so I can not tell if it is her influence that predominates.   STill Life which is set in Santa Fe was more interesting.  Steven Katz is an interesting character.  The story unwinds in the normal Jonathon matter but it lacks the character development that I enjoy in his books.   The ending is interesting.  Unfortunately the story is too short to really care about any of the characters. <br />The other In the Land of the Giants is an old story.  Although Dorothy is interesting again we did not have the time to watch her really develop.   <br />I imagine the Kellerman's had some fun writing this and it was pleasant entertaining.  Really the effort proves that two is not always better than one.	2004-11-27

The never ending stay in the small town in New Hampshire was uninteresting.  I also have trouble figuring out what really happened.  If someone want to explain this to me please send me an E Mail. <br /> <br /> <br />Others have enjoyed these books so I will not give away too much.

The fun of the book is watching the killer react when his plan goes awry.  He cleverly with exquisite execution defuses the situation. <br /> <br />The FBI agent who is pursuing him adds very little to the effort.  I keep waiting for her to add some significance to the narration but it never happens. <br /> <br />The character of the hit man who for some reason Mr. Perry only names once in the book is engaging.  We forget that he is a cold blooded killer until we are reminded by an FBI agent.  The second wonderful part of the book is the description of Las Vegas.  I have shared it with a friend of mine who lived and worked in Las Vegas for several years and from her description it was right on. <br /> <br />Lastly and this may be carping.

This is simply a wonderful book <br /> This is the second time I read this book. I read this for a book club. I had remembered the portions about baseball and the wonderful relationship between Ms. Goodwin and her father.  The rereading does not diminish the pleasure of this portion of the book.   <br /> <br />The second reading permitted me to think about the the insightful description of growing up in the 50's--an experience I share with Ms Goodwin.  It was a simpler time when fathers came home the same time and mothers stayed home and raised the children.  Children owned the streets and everyone was growing together.  Ms. Goodwin also points out that it also was a time when woman could not work.  A simpler time is not always the better time. <br /> <br />The most interesting portion of the book on the second reading is the foreshadowing of what is required to be a historian.  Joining her ability to recreate a ball game as the beginning of her career as a historian, which she points out depends upon the ability to tell a story.  SEcond when historical events such as the integration of Little Rock we see her mastery of history.   <br /> <br />I used to think that No Ordinary Times was my favorite book.

I measure a mystery by the characters that one meets, the excitement the plot generates and the ending.  This effort gets 2 out of 3.  <br />There are wonderful characters such as Blu the beautiful secretary and Sammy Liston( a wonderful name) who move the story along.  Also the portrait of Pope and his role in the housing development was terrific.<br />Arvin also makes an effort to have some serious thoughts.  There are several pages of wonderful writing in this effort.<br />The two criticisms were a little too much foreshadowing and the ending just was not up to the rest of the story.

The style is the same, a long day with the unknown person until the end driving the action.

It clearly marked the end of Reconstruction and influenced the subsequent 90 years.  Essentially, in the election of Hayes who is portrayed as a decent individual and Republican party giving up its commitment to Black rights we see the end of the battle for equality.  <br />The story is told well by Mr. Morris.  It is impossible to read this without drawing comparisons to 2000.  Some of the reviewers have argued that there were differences but some of the similarities are striking.  Tilden like Gore made fundamental errors immediately after the votes were cast. IN each case there was faith in a legal strategy that did not work while their opponents out manuevered them on the ground.  Also Florida was the place where the work was decided.  <br />I suggest that anyone reading this book also read 1876 by Gore Vidal to understand how different society was at that time.	2004-03-21

In his early works he wrote suspense stories.  In The Last Juror the suspense which is secondary to the development of wonderful characters.  Miss Callie is a wonderful woman who shows how a powerful force for good can make her whole family better.  It is worth reading this book just to meet her.  <br />The rest of the small town characters such as Harry Rex and Baggy as well as Will himself and his grandmother are wonderfully drawn.   <br />Some reviewers have commented that the book lacked suspense.  It seems that Grisham is moving in his work.  Rather than a fast moving book such as Angels and Demons with little character development, Grisham is now writing slower moving books with wonderful characters.  The Testament and the King of Torts are examples.   I think that the new Grisham is every bit as enjoyable as the early Grisham but just a little different.	2004-03-21

By the way the reviews on Amazon written by readers are better in my view than most one reads by professionals.  I agree that the book is a great page turner in the beginning because the premise is terrific.  The problem is that there is not a satisfying or believable resolution.  The other disappointment is that Baldacci at his best develops memorable characters such as in Absolute Control or the Winner.  In this book none of the characters grew or surprised.  <BR>If you have not read Baldacci before do not start with this one.  If you have read his others prepare for having fun but the book will not measure up.	2004-01-04

Garfield	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Forgotten President	This is a wonderful book.  It is a compelling story of James Garfield who was an accidental president.  Garfield was only in office in 6 months and most of that was spent battling to have offices filled.  <br />The background of life in the White House.  The lack of security and the open atmosphere of the White House is so interesting when compared with what we know have.  <br />Also the story of the Nominating Convention is compelling.  The studies of Chester Arthur, Blaine and Senator Conklin are wonderful.  Meeting these individuals is a bonus in this story.  <br />This is a wonderful book.	2003-11-30

He is a Vietnam hero, a lawyer but his major occupation is as an avenger of wrongs.  Other reviewers describe the story.  <br />My comments are that he seemed just a bit too hard to believe.  Also the 9/11 angle just was too far fetched.  <br />In summary the book was fun to read but thinking about it afterward it did not hang together.	2003-11-30

Other reviews have repeated the story so it is not worth going into the details.  The mystery portion of this historical thriller, is well paced and continues to unravel.  <BR>The wonderful part of the book is the character development.  I especially enjoyed HOlmes, Longfellow and Lowell.  We began to understand them as the extraordinary people they were as they dealt with the crisis of the murders in Boston. Also I particularly enjoyed the relationship between Oliver Wendell Holmes and his son.  At times coincidence was stretched somewhat, but that is normal for a good mystery.  Even the minor characters were fascinating.<BR>Lastly the historical color added to overall impression.  There were touching scenes of post Civil War Boston.<br />All in all a wonderful effort. I can not wait for Mr. Pearl's next effort.	2003-03-01

Also a judge in New York was reversing the conviction of the Central Park jogger alleged rapists.  If Turow's book only dealt with these issues brillantly as he did the book would have been timely and engrossing.  The story shows the unraveling of the truth and we see how errors were made.  We also learn that the police are honorable in their way and do their job well but still can be wrong.<br />In addition,Reversible Errors examines old relationships and finds errors, some of which can be reversed others that can not be.  Gillian ,the judge who convicted Gandolph, is in my view the most attractive character in book.  She is correcting her past errors.  Muriel the PA and Larry the fascinating police detective are having more difficult correcting their errors.  I doubt they ever will.  In any event these parallel relationships enhance the book.<br />Many reviewers have compared Turow to Grisham.  There is no comparison.  Grisham is fun. Turow is a master.	2003-01-26

Hornet Flight like Jackdaws deals with penetration into occupied Europe, but unlike his past efforts the characters were not believable.  Harald the hero and his girl friend Kathy are totally dependent on unreal coincidences to move the plot along.  There were opportunities of character development especially with Kathy's and Harald's parents but instead they were made comic book, as a prior reviewer said, figures.  <br />In short I would rather invest my time in reading some wonderful prior Follett's than this effort.	2003-01-05
