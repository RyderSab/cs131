If you want to learn programming, this book is not for you. If you want a reference book you can go back to, this book might be helpful, but other books may be better (I am also amazed at how many people try to use learning materials as reference manuals and reference manuals as learning materials). If you want to learn to create files from scatch, this book is not for you (personally, I would rather learn how to animate the snowflakes in chapter 6 rather than starting from nothing and wasting time drawing a snowflake from scratch).  <br /> <br />This author never claims the reader will learn programming, that the book should be used as a reference, or that readers will create files from scratch, so why evaluate the book on those criteria? It is like buying an SUV and then being disappointed with it because it gets low gas mileage. <br /> <br />The author's goal for this book is clear - to learn to create flash animations and interactive files. In that regard, I thought the book was a huge success! I have gone through many computer books dealing with many applications (Access, Filemaker, Excel, SPSS, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, InDesign, and Illustrator to name a few), and this was easily one of the best. If your goal is to learn Flash quickly, then I highly recommend this book.	2005-09-07

(Alvin Hansen Symposium Series on Public Policy)	Books	2	12	46	N	N	technical, but okay	This book will appeal to economists who specialize in human capital policy, but by focusing on methodology is too technical. It was written by economists, which means that the book's main purpose is twofold: 1. vain attempts at the quantification of human and social psychology and 2. cheerleading for conservatism. The solutions are practical, but you get the sense the authors, all instructors at ivy league or very selective institutions, are divorced from reality and actually believe the reduction of complex social problems can be simply solved from an ivory tower.    Not surprisingly, Heckman and Carneiro (HC) advocate vouchers and choice as the solution, again as if just by adding market mechanisms into any social endeavor will magically lead to socially optimal outcomes, in this case equality.  HC's first point is that there is a perception that something is wrong with education. They are correct on that point, although it may not be true. Other countries perform better than the U.S. on many assessments because they track students early into vocational and postsecondary settings. In the U.S., we have had to accept lower performance in exchange for access and increased levels choice.     The cause of lower performance, HC suggest, is that teachers have little incentives to produce knowledge. The same, of course, can be said about professors like HC. For instance, if you do a search on google, the Univ. of Chi. website, an academic search engine, or the Univ. of Chi. economics department, you will see no evidence that students in his class have ever learned anything (not that they haven't; there just isn't any evidence). Since Heckman is dealing with a group of highly motivated and academically prepared students, all he is doing is just not messing them up instead of actually contributing to their knowledge. Heckman's students would be much better off in an economics course at what HC call a \\"lower quality\\" institution, where instructors have to actually show evidence of learning and where the least academically prepared with the least advantages in life show actual growth in learning.    Indeed, Heckman himself has incentives to not care. He's got tenure, earns six figures, never gets evaluated on what students learn or needs to provide evidence of it. HC's argument is compelling, and all colleges and schools should be held accountable and demonstrate learning outcomes. But I doubt as professors HC would ever be willing to  implement the same policies in their programs they advocate in their article (i.e. annual program reviews, annual publicly articulated assessment of learning, etc.). I think I smell a couple of chickenhawks...	2005-09-05

After reading this and Raphael's other two Revolutionary era books, however, I don't think I will see things in the same way.  <br /> <br />The fact is that many of the \\"revolutionary ideas\\" the founding fathers espoused had been around for years and were not that revolutionary after all (except for some of their ideas on religion, to which some were either indifferent or openly hostile); Massachusetts was basically an independent state before the Declaration of Independence without the help or assistance of the founding fathers; and that the people, not a group of 8 or so rich guys, played a much more important role in America's independence (in fact, like today, the rich didn't even fight - they bought their way out).  <br /> <br />The main point of this book is that our current views of history allow us to disregard the contributions of the many, who bear the most costs, to the benefit of the few, who bear little if any cost (I doubt any of the soldiers fighting in today's wars will see any oil money, while the president and his friends, who have never fought in any wars, will benefit handsomly).  <br /> <br />The fact that people, not the rich, were the main drivers behind the revolution is a revolutionary idea. What could be more patriotic than that?	2005-08-24

That is why republicans focus on issues they can't possibly win (gay marriage, war on terror, fairness in the media, etc.). People like Goldberg actually believe that if only the pesky liberals, despite having little to no real control over anything, would get out of the way, we could truly make progress. Long ago Republicans figured out the economic returns for the very wealthy from losing a few social issues were well worth the costs, particularly since the poor dupes who vote for them foolishly think Republicans actually care about the social issues they profess.  <br /> <br />Despite this flawed thesis, the book is entertaining and sometimes funny.	2005-08-15

For the first time, I was asked to teach a statistics course this past summer.  <br /> <br />To be honest, I was not excited. If you ask today's professors, most students are bored, unmotivated, lazy malcontents who feel a good grade or degree should be handed to them on a silver platter with no work or effort. <br /> <br />Nothing could be further from the truth.  <br /> <br />What I discovered (with the exception of a few students) was a group of motivated students eager to learn. And granted, some were more interested in getting a good grade and saw learning as a vehicle towards that (research proves that grades are pretty worthless indicators of learning anyway. Students figured that out a long time ago; I'm amazed professors still believe it).  <br /> <br />I also discovered that when professors call students unmotivated, they aren't talking about the students -- they're talking about themselves. <br /> <br />If you are a boring instructor whose entire teaching method is based on lecture and your class is required to complete a program, of course the students forced to sit there are going to be unmotivated. Certainly, students are responsible for their own learning, but when professors say negative things about their students based more on anecdote than actual research, they negate their own responsibility. Tenure is not a shield from a accountability. <br /> <br />Teaching was a blast and students gave my teaching high marks. Not because I was a dynamic speaker, funny, entertaining, and approachable (which they all said I was), but mostly because they  felt like they actually understood the material. Imagine my joy when a student taking stats for the third time finally figured out how to plot a regression line. Teaching and learning is a two-way street; enough with the excuses.	2005-07-23

Imagine my joy when contemporary writers (McCullough, Ellis, Zinn, Shaara, etc.) managed to  highlight the remarkable achievements of the individuals involved in these eras.  <br /> <br />In many of the publications, I kept seeing Morris' name pop up and thought I would read this biography. The main problem with this book is the writing and style. While technically obeying the elements of the English language, the author's style is agonizingly plodding and uninteresting (just like the textbooks and professors that encouraged me to avoid historical scholarship for the first 25 years of my life). Frustratingly, the author applauds the efforts of Ellis, McCullough, and Elkins in brining the people and events of this era alive -- and then does the exact opposite, writing a book so bland discombobulated only a machoist could enjoy it.  <br /> <br />There is a reason public demand is so high for books by Chernow, Ellis, and Brands and why this book will quickly be relegated to never-been-checked-out library book sales. The author had an opportunity to write about an interesting subject, but choose instead to write a pretentious 300 page sleeping pill. What a missed opportunity! <br /> <br />By itself, the book is tolerable, but put it next to Chernow, Ellis, or even Elkins and McKitrick and it is crushed. On the bright side, you could learn a thing or two about Morris by reading this book -- just don't expect to have near as much fun as you would with other authors.	2005-06-21

However, I thought I would give Randall another chance with his Hamilton biography. I thought it was slightly better than the Jefferson bio. <br /> <br />Then I read Chernow's Hamilton biography, which leaves Randall's in the dust. The main problem with Randall is that he is a professor and, as convential wisdom goes, professors write to pad their vita and for other professors, with little concern for the reader and more concern for quantity than quality. (In fact, with few exceptions [like J. Ellis], you should always skip a history book when the dust jacket announces the author is a professor). <br /> <br />This book is an adequate overview of Hamilton, but why read it when an exceptionally better book exists? For completists and Hamilton enthusiasts only.	2005-06-07

Despite the author's status as a full-time professor, the writing style is clear and concise. Also, the author should receive praise for making history relevant in contemporary policy debates and disspelling several myths about the history of higher education.  <br /> <br />On the other hand, this book mainly covers the history of ivy league institutions and the 30 or so national selective public and private universities. Maybe the quest for a comprehensive history of higher education -- one that truly covers all colleges and all students -- is elusive and perhaps impossible, but I remain hopeful someone will someday pull it off.  <br /> <br />Bottom line: a pretty decent introduction to the history of higher education.	2005-04-13

In this case, that is very good because the author addresses many unanswered questions about Washington, in the process presenting the man over the myth.  <br /> <br />Because of its berevity, readability, and well-written storyline, it is tempting to recommend this book as an introduction. However, I would recommend reading a few other detailed narratives (in particular Shaara's American Revolution books) before this to set the context. <br /> <br />I still think the best Washington biography is Flexner's - if you have time, the four-volume set is excellent, but the one-volume edition will suffice. But that does not take anything away from Ellis'.	2005-02-10

(Although to Zinn's credit he is critical of both democrats and republicans; I don't recall Schweikart writing anything positive about contemporary democrats or negative about contemporary republicans). <br /> <br />Fortunately, the author spells all of this out in the beginning. And generally he does not deny the existence of America's faults, although making excuses for those faults (like slavery) on the basis that at least we're not as bad as others (the Arab world's horrible track record on human rights) is problematic.  <br /> <br />This book is worth reading, but seeing it as gospel will only provide you with a set of blinders. The most patriot thing you can do is read it -- and Zinn's -- with an open mind and realize that judging the United States is more than about being publicly proud of our ideals and accomplishments, but also recognizing and learning from our lapses in judgment.	2005-02-05

I do not recommend it as a reference tool or if you want to learn only one or two things quickly -- the steps and lessons are sequential.  <br /> <br />Although this book can be kept in your library as a very decent reference, my recommendation is that if you want to learn Fireworks from scratch, then get this book and buy another if you want something around to continually reference.	2004-11-07

The previous reviewer of this book could not have been more wrong about grades. Actually, research shows grades are a horrible predictor of success when controlling for other factors (income, socio-economic status, etc.). Research also shows there is *no* link between a grade and what someone has learned. This is because grades are relative and measure an individual's performance at one time, although I will admit that using multiple methods and more numerous testing will increase the validity of grades. If tied to the learning goals of a course, grades can be effective. But as a policy making tool or measure of what someone has learned, grades really don't say much, if anything at all.	2004-05-25

Tolerate this book if it is assigned for the class, but buy something a lot better if you really want to learn about regression.	2004-02-24

This book is a paradox: it is geared for those who want to learn about multivariate statistics, but is written for those who are very experienced with multivariate analysis, espicially mathematical applications.     Why an instructor would ever assign this book is beyond me; buy and tolerate this book for class if you must. In fact, I don't know one student in my multivariate class who did not complement, supplement, and eventually supplant this text with another text, exasperated by the authors' pretentiousness and unnecessarily complex explanations.    Maybe advanced statisticians will appreciate this book, but as a learning tool it is totally worthless.    My ulimate recommendation is to not enroll in multivariate statistics and purchase the graduate version of SPSS and a multivariate book geared towards learning. I guarantee you will have learned just as much - if not more - as the poor people who suffered through this text and the graduate-level course associated with it.    Employers today - whether they be a business or university - are much more concerned with what you actually know, as opposed to what course you took, anyway.	2004-02-24

This book was clearly written for other professors and advanced statisticians and definetely not students. If you get assigned this book for an introductory statistics class, buy or check out other books from the library.  <br />On the other hand, this book is not totally worthless. If you are well versed in statistics and have had several advanced classes, this book serves as an actually decent review manual. <br />Overall, in retrospect it was worth the buy.  However, I am amazed by the number of professors who actually think this book is adequate for an introductory statistics class.  (The typical professor retort &quot;the authors are respected in the field and have published prolifically&quot; doesn't really mean a lot in the real world, where people are more interested in learning and not really impressed by the number of publications a professor has).	2003-07-27

The only criticism I have is that in teaching the reader to &quot;think like an economist,&quot; Wheelan literally thinks *exclusively* like an economist.  <br />For instance, Wheelan asserts spraying DDT, thus eliminating pests, can be good in some instances because the costs (pollution) outweigh the benefits (better economic benefits in the long run leading to reduced pollution levels eventually).  Organisms, however, are notorious for building resistance, as evident with the fruit fly population explosions and the failures of modern antiboitics to keep up with the new bacterias.  Taking an economic approach, an ignoring an evolutionary one, can be dangerous indeed.<br />Despite, this book is very good and well written and is highly recommended.	2002-11-25

However, the author's do a good <BR>job of getting the main point of the book across -- that America <BR>has become increasingly conservative since the early 1970's.  <BR>(Nixon would have fit in well with the Democrats today and Clinton certainly would have fit very comfortably with the Republicans in the 1970's).  I thought the authors were pretty clear that the Clinton years (and all the scandals) could not yet be completed or analyzed (the book was written in 1998) and hindsight is usually needed when writing about history.  In any event, the authors were not kind at all to the democrats of the 1960's and pretty much imply that the democratic party and its candidates in the 1970's was a wasteland -- look for comment on the Clinton scandals in the next edition.  As far as the Reagan scandals (he told his lies and had his scandals too), I would try not to confuse objective analysis with a witch-hunt (conservatives think any criticism of Reagan is unwarranted, despite *his* scandals, and liberals do the same with Clinton and Kennedy).  Rather, I suggest you <BR>read this moderately interesting, rather short book with an open mind. (We all know about Clinton's scandals, but a pretty good objective analysis of a few of Reagan's blunders and scandals is Ambrose's Rise to Globalism).	2002-03-08

Why are they so forceful in their arguments that admissions should be fair for *everyone*, but are oddly silent when it comes to preferential admissions for student-athletes, legacies, or those whose parents make sizable donations?<br />The focus on race, and neglect of these other areas, shows too clearly where those who are against affirmative action are coming from...	2001-12-31

While Zinn's title will anger friends of the corporate world, millionaires, and the hopelessly-stuck-in-the-middle-class individuals who amazingly follow them, Iron's book is more objective.<br />The major strengths of the book are: the short biographies and stories of the people involved in the cases and the justices (how many people actually know who Plessy was?); a professional and informative, but not academic, writing style that will not alienate 99% of the public (hint: if you see a history book written by a professor, put it down and look for another - they write for other professors and themselves, not to add anything significant to the field of history); and the introduction detailing how the Constitution was created -- quite possibly the best telling of the story I have ever read.<br />Overall, a very good book and an ideal introduction to a history of the Supreme Court.	2001-06-27

Rather than focusing on specific details in an orderly fashion, Solberg delves deep into the culture of the university and how it impacted the intellectual environment and future movements.  His telling of the story is similar to approaches taken by Veysey, Rudolph, Soloman, and Brubacher &amp; Rudy.<br />While refreshing and admirable, Solberg -- a retired professor --can't break out of the mold of writing for other professors, not the general public.  In other words, the writing style is often dull, academic, and monotone, in spite of his retelling of interesting stories, and is clearly written to add something to the field of the study of higher education, not to the general history of the university or society.  It is the type of book that, when first published, sells about 5000 copies, is lauded and praised at academic conferences, and five years later is forgotten (it is currently out of print, even though published in 1967) until a journalist or non-professor historian writes a more interesting story, adding much more to the general body of knowledge.<br />Fortunately, Solberg's enthusiasm for the project comes through.  The bottom line on this book is that is a well-informed and detailed history of the Univ. of Il, but written in a typical academic style, taking a lot away from what could have been a great book; a true landmark.  Regardless, I recommend it to anyone interested in the history of the university or higher education in general.	2001-06-27

The one main difference between the two is that while Zinn is skeptical of everything and even admits to his hero's shortcomings...Johnson refuses to look at conservative leaders objectively and honestly...Regardless, Johnson's book is well written and covers some details Zinn misses -- it is a good, if opinionated, read (which makes it more fun!).  I recommend reading Zinn and Johnson only for those well versed in history, able to know that Zinn and Johnson are writing through their own lenses, and can differentiate between fact and fiction.	2001-05-24
