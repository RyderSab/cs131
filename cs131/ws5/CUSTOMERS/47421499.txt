US	47421499	RP85E6C11YTR7	1893687678	244197139	Wings of Morning	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Superlative!	WINGS OF MORNING is perhaps the most impressive chapbook I've seen.  The writing is exquisite and the stories are entertainment of the highest order.<br /><br />\\"If I Take the Wings of Morning\\" is a mixture of fantasy and science fiction.  Usually the combination fails, but in Ms. Kimbriel's hands, it not only works, it succeeds.  The story is set in the future, with the United States at war with, it seems, almost everyone.  The protagonist is an archaeologist on a dig at a site that seems cursed.  As international tensions mount, they also rise at the dig.  The story's solution to the problems of the future is to return to the past.  Whether one agrees or not with the theme, the story is absorbing and powerful.<br /><br />In many ways, \\"Ducks\\" is an even better story, as the protagonist, a girl almost ready to begin the tranformation to womanhood, is taught to hunt ducks by drowning them.  There's no attempt to hide the violence, but the overall feeling of the story is one of gentle wisdom.  The post-apocalyptic setting is not the only thing that reminded me of Edgar Pangborn's incredible DAVY.<br /><br />Ms. Kimbriel is a talent to be watched.  She's already a most impressive writer, and I expect her to continue to develop her literary muscles.	2005-08-12

It reminded me of Manly Wade Wellman's stories.  It is perhaps the best story in the collection.<br /><br />\\"Ghost Writer\\" is more like a John Collier romp, a story is which a writer ghosts a real ghost.  I hope this teaser makes you want to read the story.  Give in to temptation and curiosity -- it's a treat that won't add to your waistline.<br /><br />\\"Blood Kin\\" is a no-holds-barred, take-no-prisoners vampire story.<br /><br />\\"Nice Truck\\" is a bizarre mixture of \\"My Mother the Car,\\" a bubba story, and vice avenged.  It should be a dog, but it isn't at all.  It's a very fun story.<br /><br />I expect to read and enjoy more Keltora stories by Ms. Underwood, but I hope she writes more stories like these as well.  I'm not sure she's aware of how well she writes -- which may be part of her charm as a writer.	2005-08-12

It's sort of a backwoods Bubba in King Arthur's court, and it was another pleasure to read the story here.  On first hearing, the story was entirely too good not to want to have a copy to keep.<br /><br />\\"Worse\\" is an amusing little story about an elf prince who's supposed to marry a foreign princess and, after meeting her, would rather eat dirt -- not a normal part of the elvish diet.<br /><br />The piece de resistance is \\"Dracula's Lawyer,\\" the title story, in which a lawyer is hired by the legendary Carpathian prince to bring suit against a town for not hiring him as an accountant.  Since he can't expose himself to sunlight to apply or to work during daylight hours, he's using the Americans With Disabilities Act to fight for the job.<br /><br />Ms. Mandala has a knack of creating characters one immediately cares about and her style is clean and witty.  While not heavyweights, these stories are a pleasure to read.	2005-07-31

It's a fantasy -- sort of -- although there are no wizards.  It has a touch of romance and a dash of mystery, all stirred by a collection of characters who are, well, characters.<br /><br />Every small town has its characters.  For some reason, quirks that either die out or turn sinister in a city seem to flower in small towns, and Tranquility may have a trace more than its fair share , but they add life and color.  One of the most amusing is an old lady who can see about fifteen seconds into the future, so she's always answering questions before they're asked.  The dialog is almost dizzying, and very entertaining.  And there's the hermit called \\"Debbie,\\" who may be D.B. Cooper, who parachuted into the wilderness with a chunk of airline money and was never seen again.<br /><br />The two big things happening in Tranquility are the arrival of the new town doctor and animal mutilations, which may be caused by a large, predatory bird.<br /><br />While it might be hard to assign a category to this short novel, it's easy to identify it as a fun read.<br /><br />Bill Allen's GODS AND OTHER CHILDREN is a marvelous fantasy that reminds us that fantasy should be fun.<br /><br />Carl is a wargod who's decided to quit the family business.  He'd rather be playing music at an inn for drinks and enjoying life than providing morons with an excuse for slaughter.<br /><br />Because Allen uses some of the same story materials, I was reminded of flashes of the Amber series, LORD OF LIGHT, and the Dilvish short stories, but Allen is not imitation Zelazny, or imitation anything, for that matter.  He's a writer who's found his own voice and writes with verve and wit.<br /><br />These stories, while very different (and perhaps because they're very different) complement each other nicely.<br /><br />This is the second Double Dog from Yard Dog Press and, like the first, reminds us that too much of modern fantasy and science fiction has become self-conscious and self-important.  These books avoid those pitfalls, and do it by taking the mission of entertaining the reader as their first duty.modern fantasy and science fiction has become self-conscious and self-important.

They were actually better in terms of fit and casting quality than some products presently on the market.  And as a special treat, they were the only source for armored knights, gladiators, and movie monsters.  Even the movie monsters issued by other companies were actually molds from the defunct Aurora line.<br /><br />The only question is whether the book was more fun to read or to look at for the pictures.	2005-04-17

The Ace books were seldom of the same literary quality, but most were great fun reads.  To the uninitiated, the Ace Double Novels were actually two novellas or short novels (40,000 words)set back-to-back, each with their own cover.<br /><br />Yard Dog Press has revived the basic idea behind the Ace books with their Double Dogs and may have achieved a greater success.<br /><br />I seldom read science fiction anymore.  Too often, the writer's Great Idea is emphasized to the extent that characterization, plot, and literary quality are secondary at best.  Major novels by big-name pros have left me cold because the secondary characters were the usual caricatures one loves to hate and the protagonists were almost reptilian.<br /><br />If all Science Fiction were as much fun and as well-written as Jeffrey Turner's THIS INSTANCE OF ME, I'd read a lot more of it.  Turner has the great idea but mixes it with a fine whodunit and characters I can really care about.  The action takes place aboard a station where cutting-edge research is being conducted.  Forge is a project to provide a cheap source of energy, while Hammer is designed to permit faster-than-light travel.<br /><br />They do not, however, perform quite as advertised.  Instead, they open parallel time-lines which becomes both part of the mystery and the solution to it.<br /><br />Mark Tiedemann's OF STARS AND SHADOWS lives up to the standards of its partner.  Everyone is familiar with the ending of most space opera, where the outnumbered but valiant rebels beat the empire.  Tiedemann's book begins with this scenario, then examines the ramifications.  Ru Cowel has led a force that killed the emperor and receives the surrender of the empire but discovers that dismantling it is a task similar to riding a tiger.<br /><br />Besides the question of whether he can dismantle the empire, there is a more pressing matter -- should he dismantle it, as the empire is the only force enforcing an uneasy peace among rivals.<br /><br />There's enough intrigue in this book to satisfy downtown Rome or Byzantium, enough action and threat for those who require that, and some very deft characterizations and all-round good writing for those of us who place a premium on such things.<br /><br />OF STARS AND SHADOWS is an excellent companion piece to THIS INSTANCE OF ME because both are high quality works and they complement each other almost perfectly.<br /><br />I'm already eager to see the next Double Dog.re is the only force enforcing an uneasy peace among rivals. <br />There's enough intrigue in this book to satisfy downtown Rome or Byzantium, enough action and threat for those who require that, and some very deft characterizations and all-round good writing for those of us who place a premium on such things. <br />OF STARS AND SHADOWS is an excellent companion piece to THIS INSTANCE OF ME because both are high quality works and they complement each other almost perfectly. <br />I'm already eager to see the next Double Dog.	2005-02-05

There are no unwanted archaisms or awkward sentence structures here, but the best qualities -- good characterization, adventure, and \\"feel,\\" the sense of being on an alien world or in the slum sector of a station, are all well presented.<br /><br />The first story, \\"For the Honor of the Hunt,\\" is set on an alien world settled by human colonists who've established a matriachal culture.  Men are considered too violent and unstable to be permitted the use of weapons, although the society seems to be slowly changing.<br /><br />Britta NiGwen is a bounty hunter on the trail of a dangerous man, then discovers the hunt has been complicated by her competition, the first male bounty hunter.  Further complications develop when it turns out the opposition is more than just one man.  A good, exciting story, well-written.<br /><br />\\"Playing with Fire,\\" the second story may be even better.  The protagonist is male and Gifford proves she can write -- and write well -- from the male perspective.<br /><br />Tarn runs a junk shop on the wrong side of the tracks, or what passes for tracks on a station.  He may lose his business because of inheritance tax, but is offered a way out by an acquaintance named Dela.  Her solution is illegal and dangerous, but seems the only way out of the bind.<br /><br />Tarn and his new partner Ranen, the kid tech wizard provided by Dela, learn there are greater dangers than inheritance taxes and poverty, as their plan goes awry and they must worry about both the authorities and the rebels.  This is a taut story with a very satisfying conclusion and reminds me how science fiction used to be written before it became top-heavy with self importance.	2004-12-25

No empty mental calories here.<br /><br />\\"What Comes Around\\" is a marvelous story of opportunity and responsibility and is best described as magical realism.  The protagonist faces the same problems we all do, but her method of dealing with them is in the realm of the fantastic.  Still, while magic might be an opportunity, it also carries responsibility.  To me, this story was worth the price of the book by itself, making the other stories bonuses.<br /><br />Brad Sinor's \\"Location Shoot\\" is a fun little story but I'm not sure it qualifies as fantasy -- the notion of Hollywood prima donnas and agents being dragons struck me as too likely to dismiss as fantasy.<br /><br />Sue Sinor's second story, \\"Christmas Shopping,\\" resembles her first story in that the story has more twists and turns than a politician's stump speech but is far more fun.  It ended a bit abruptly for me, but the story has so many things going for it it's hard to object.<br /><br />I will warn the reader there are typos.  Some people can't seem to get around them while other readers hardly notice them.  To me, they're sort of literary speed bumps and I suspect future printings will have the typos corrected.<br /><br />This is one of those books that reminds you that fun can have a bit of depth.	2004-12-05

The writing, never less than workmanlike is first-rate in THE BLACK HUNTER.  THE BLACK HUNTER combines elements of a love story (not a romance-type but more like the real thing,) horror, and the best sort of sword and sorcery.  Underwood draws her characters sharply and clearly, until the reader feels he or she knows the characters as people.  In THE BLACK HUNTER, Conor Manahan meets Eithne the healer and falls in love with her.  This takes place at a threatened encampment infiltrated by the dark forces of the enemy.  The plot is exceptional, taking twists that are totally unexpected but totally logical.<br />&quot;Willowherb&quot; is more about the development of the relationship between Conor and Eithne, but is still involved with the war, and the bogies used by the dark forces.<br />&quot;Wyrd,&quot; even more than the other stories, shows us the warmth of writing that readers of Underwood's fiction have come to expect.  I haven't read such a warm writer since Edgar Pangborn.<br />This is a truly marvelous book, and I urge all fantasy readers to rush out and buy a copy.	2004-04-25

Rand combines the old west with the weird and deals up a winning hand each time.  Each story has its charm but if I had to pick one that stood out, it would probably be &quot;A Spider Poor Cowboy Rapt and Wide Lemon,&quot; which title makes sense if you say it aloud and allow for some linguistic drift.  In this story, a ghost decides to settle in the saloon, and the regulars have to exorcise it to save the business.<br />The stories are all cleanly written, with almost no verbal cellulite and are a pleasure to read.  This book represents, to me, money well spent.<br />If I have to mention a problem, it's a very small one; the stories were originally published in magazines and weren't edited for the collection, so there are small bits of redundancy, but the glitch is a minor one, and the stories are major fun.<br />I'll be looking forward to reading more of Ken Rand's work.	2004-03-27

Ned	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Ned Helped Write This Review	To be completely upfront about it, I have a story in this collection.  Any writer worth his keyboard is going to tell you that his is the best story in the collection.  I can't honestly say that -- the quality of the stories is remarkably high.  Even more amazing is that there isn't a single total dog in the whole collection, an event rarer than a solar eclipse.<br />This is not for those who sip their tea with dainty pinky extended, this is for somebody who finds humor in someone putting away a six-pack and belching the first stanza of a country-western song.<br />I was afraid, with the guidelines, that the stories might seem redundant, and several elements were used more than once -- the lethality of stomach gas and halitosis, for instance -- but the treatments were different enough that I didn't get the feeling &quot;here we go again.&quot;<br />There were so many bizarre and inventive stories that to choose one is difficult, but perhaps the story of the really lonely guy who built himself a woman out of Spam was one of the best, and pretty illustrative of the sort of outrageous humor that makes this book a pleasure to read.  Some shyer types may want to take the cover off John Grisham novel to hide the fact that they're not among the brain-washed, but for the rest of us, the cover was part of the fun.	2004-01-13

She has succeeded in melding traditional fantasy (a wizard's apprentice and an enchanted princess among other elements), with exotic features (for one, the setting is not the usual western Europe but the Punjab), and excellent writing.<br />The characters are not only vividly drawn, they grow, although they still have very human weaknesses.<br />Hale is, in many ways, very true to life.  She points out that whether one wins or loses the important struggles, other problems will remain.<br />While the threads are available for a sequel, and I'd eagerly buy and read one, I do not demand one because this book is such a superlative piece of work.<br />The essence of stone is not only the title of gthe book but a question posed to the apprentice, and the answer is appropriate.<br />First rate.	2003-07-27

I know and like John Dalmas as a person as well as a writer, and, as much as I enjoy his novels, his short stories are even better.  I suspect that John Dalmas is one of the most underrated writers in the business.<br />The book, as a physical product, is a nice piece of work, although I wish it had included a table of contents.<br />&quot;Gullikksen and the 500-Pound Hallucination&quot; is a marvelous story and the setting, a Great Lakes coal-fed vessel, makes it even more exotic.  &quot;Moonlight Nocturne,&quot; more mystery than science fiction or fantasy, is a marvelous piece set during Prohibition, and features a character with an idiocyncratic idea of justice.<br />&quot;Picture Man&quot; involves some interesting psychic research John has studied, phenomena that always makes the hairs on my arms stand up, but is a story, not just a compilation of odd facts.  It was rejected by three magazines, finally published by &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction,&quot; and was republished in two of the three &quot;year's best&quot; anthologies.<br />&quot;Out of the North, a Giant,&quot; is a potent piece of work in which Dalmas, like Manly Wade Wellman, uses dialect to make a story stronger.<br />&quot;The Railroad&quot; is less a short story than the beginning of a longer work, and you barely get to know and like the characters before it is gone.  &quot;The Stoor's Map&quot; is fantasy, something Dalmas doesn't often deal with, but handles like a master.  &quot;Tiger Hunt&quot; benefits from his knowledge of environment.  I'd heard him read it, years ago, and it was a pleasure to find it in print to read.<br />&quot;The Ides of September,&quot; written for &quot;The Saint&quot; magazine, was a sort of literary grandfather to a series of stories, actually two novels and a novella, published as THE PUPPET MASTER.<br />For a time, I had trouble finding a link between all these stories, then it struck me -- all are remarkably human, like their writer.their writer.	2003-05-17

My first reading of that book was at the age of twelve, and I remembered it fondly.  Re-reading it was a pleasure, even with the somewhat stilted language.  THE RED KEEP was another pleasure, while somewhat less.  This book, I'm afraid to say, is not French's best work, which still makes it better than most.  The story moved too slowly for me, though it had a fine, brooding quality, and the characterization was excellent.  A fine tale of intrigue and justice set in twelfth century England.  I do hope that some of French's other work, including SIR MARROCK find their way back into print.  Recommended to boys of all ages.	2003-01-04

All three stories are tightly written, but without the complications for the sake of complication of some writers.  The mysteries are very intricate and involved, and require the space they're given.  I don't accept Dalmas' premises as a world-view, but find them very satisfactory as basis for a story, and, once one even conditionally accepts the premises, the story runs logically from there.  Dalmas introduces us to some fascinating people and the story never drags.  More proof that Dalmas continues to grow as a writer.	2001-11-02

Since then I've re-read it many times and bought numerous copies for friends.  In under a hundred pages, Antoine de St. Exupery managed to beautifully express some tender and profound views and teach the reader some important things about mortality and the proper appreciation of it.  The illustrations are wonderful and the text has made this book popular in several languages for over three generations.	2001-08-10

The book is demanding, requiring that the reader bring something to the reading, but is enormously rewarding.  It's a powerful work of intellect and emotion.  The incredible complexity of the story is one of its pleasures, as one sees a story thread disappear here only to show up again &quot;way over there.&quot;  I'm not alone in regarding this book as a masterpiece of literature.	2001-08-10

The most interesting and important part of the story is the cast.  One develops a real affection for many of the characters, and the wrap-up lets the reader find out what happened to them after the main story is concluded.  It's rather like being able to stay in touch with old friends.  I do think that the book was poorly served by its cover, which gives no hint of the quality of the writing.  I observed that this might be Dalmas' best book yet because as a writer he continues to grow.	2001-08-09

Tolkien's Lord of the Rings	Books	5	7	12	N	N	Not for the Hobbit-Lovers	This book is a must-read for those of us who find Tolkien's epic tedious as well as smarmy and twee.  This parody is, as a parody, excellent, with even the characters' names laugh-out-loud funny, and it follows the plot of the original closely enough to demonstrate just how padded and over-written Tolkien's books were.	2001-07-31

In this book, the barnyard organizes an election and a woodpecker, who is a smooth talker, winds up almost controlling the Bean farm.  As usual, there are morals aplenty without being preached at the reader, but, given the 1930s political background of this book (Huey Long and some other major players were obviously in Brooks' mind as he wrote this) I suspect adults will like it more than the kids, although my own children enjoyed it.  From another author, this would've gotten at least four stars, but Brooks raises the standard.	2001-07-21

Brooks was hitting his stride as a writer, and is one of the better Freddy books.  A robin friend of Freddy's needs glasses, and from there the story gets wilder.  The book is great fun and, as in all the Freddy books, has some lessons to impart to the reader, one of them being that conceit is not only a vice, but a rather silly one.  This lesson is taught, as always, without a preachy tone intruding on the story.	2001-07-05

In this case, Mrs. Bean's long-lost brother turns up and wants his share of the inheritance, something that will bankrupt Mr. Bean and possibly ruin the farm. At the same time, he is needed to help the Centerboro high school football team beat its rival, Tushville, who has ringers playing on their team.  The action is fast and furious, and a delight to read.  Brooks and his Freddy books are a godsend to parents who read to their children.	2001-07-05

I first encountered this book at about the age of twelve, read it many times, and always wanted a copy. The story has plenty of adventure, some interesting twists, and is a good read, but it also deals with how to face adversity and the danger of pride.  It's an excellent book for teenagers and adults will probably also enjoy this story.	2001-06-29

This time she focuses on three alien species, not counting the humans, and brings them all off well.  She has the ability to make the reader care about even minor characters.  The story is pretty traditional SF again, which is not my preferred reading, but Wentworth's book kept me up late at night after I should've gone to sleep &quot;just gotta finish this/the next chapter.&quot;  While not perfect, this is a very good read.	2001-06-19

Talleyrand, descended from the cadet branch of a noble family as old as that of the king, survived and prospered under every regime in France from monarchy thru the directorate and Napoleon's empire and beyond. (On taking his oath of allegiance to King Louis Phillipe, Talleyrand remarked, &quot;Well, sire, that makes my thirteenth.&quot;) A major force in the post-Napoleanic world, his air of mystery and his laconic manner earned him the nickname &quot;The Sphinx.&quot; In both virtues and vices, he was an odd mix; greedy, vain, amoral in many respects, but he had an iron will and an unquenchable love for France, no matter who ruled her. Orieux's book is both informative and eminently readable	2001-06-11

A friend couldn't finish it because the protagonist is stricken with AIDS and has friends facing death as well. One of the more interesting devices is Death as a character, and the portrayal isn't the usual, somewhat flattering picture. Carroll shows death as petty, a liar and cheat. While not an easy book to read, it is immensely rewarding.	2001-06-11

The first five books are all good Zelazny, and the first book of the second set of five was a very good read, but the story seems to have gotten away from him before it was finished and leaves too many unanswered questions to satisfy at least this reader.  From another author, it would've earned at least four stars, but Zelazny, as I've noted before, can only be compared to Zelazny.	2001-06-11

The world is real enough to almost leave grit in your teeth and the characters, most of them alien, come alive, with complexities one wouldn't expect from most writers.  I'm looking forward to reading her next book, STARS OVER STARS, and future books.	2001-06-06

Here the story is told by a young woman, and the incredibly fine mix of &quot;real&quot; and imaginary worlds, as one shades into the other and back make a deep and strong impression.  The imaginary world is impressively inventive, with a wealth of images and evocative names.  The action and danger builds to a conclusion surprising and satisfying.	2001-05-25

By the time he'd written this, King had succumbed to the &quot;my every word is golden&quot; delusion, so the thing is much larger than it needed to be.  After reading this because I promised a friend I'd do it (oh, what we do for pretty women)I decided that even 180 pages would've been too long.  The conclusion is unsatisfactory because some of the cast of characters survive.	2001-05-21

Brooks began to hit his stride as a writer.  Here, the Bean farm is being terrorized by the minions of a creature, called the Ignormus, who lives in the Big Woods.  As usual, lots of fun and excitement, and several excellent lessons, none of which are preached at the reader.	2001-05-21

While A NIGHT IN THE LONESOME OCTOBER may be Zelazny's most fun book, LORD OF LIGHT is probably the greatest.  It's science fiction written in the vocabulary of fantasy.  Basically, settlers on an alien world, using advanced technology, create a world corresponding to Hindu mythology, with members of the crew taking on the aspects and powers of Hindu deities.  There is even a means of electronically providing for reincarnation.  The battles between the gods are epic and the verbal depictions are as good as a mural.  The ending is also some of Zelazny's most touching writing, without ever dipping into the maudlin.	2001-05-18

The major characters include Jack the Ripper, Count Dracula, the Wolfman, Dr. Frankenstein (and his creation), Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson, and about half a dozen more odd souls, most of whom have animal familiars, and the whole story is told by Jack's familiar, a dog named Snuff.  Zelazny mixes black humor, sometimes manic humor, and lovely writing, and the tapes, read by the author, are as comforting to listen to as a bedtime story by a dear friend.	2001-05-18

As one expects of Zelazny, the characterization has more depth than most writers can show. The protagonist is a Chinese demon who is facing a hidden enemy. Adventures abound, and the odd paradox as well. It will be hard to look at a bottle again without wondering what sort of world it holds.	2001-05-18
US	47421499	R31OAYISYUMN8Y	0380770229	588478390	Donnerjack	Books	4	6	9	N	N	New Mythology	This collaboration between Roger Zelazny and Jane Lindskold, while not entirely seamless, is very smooth.  As one would expect of a Zelazny book, the characters and settings are wildly inventive.  The virtual world, populated by living programs and mythic deities, is attempting to take physical reality in the &quot;real&quot; world.  This is only the background plot.  Much of the opening deals with a deal with a devil -- or Death, and the rest of the novel is involved with the consequences.  Not quite as taut as, say, Lord of Light, the novel is nevertheless excellent.  The novel would deserve a five-star rating if I were comparing it to the work of almost any other writer, but Zelazny can only be compared to Zelazny.	2001-05-18

Had Yard Dog Press not published this volume of short stories, the readers would've been robbed.  From the first (and best) story, &quot;Prom Date,&quot; to the last, Selina Rosen brings a quirky sensibility to her work.  &quot;Prom Date&quot; alone is worth the price of admission.  I had the pleasure of hearing Ms. Rosen read the story to a SRO crowd and had everyone in stitches.  Would you rather not take a date to a prom or take a dead prom date?	2001-05-17

Written during the Second World War, there are mentions of rationing and scrap iron drives, but most children won't find these a distraction.  This seems to be the first appearance of Freddy's nemesis, Herbert Garble, and there are the usual --unpreachy-- lessons, such as not to take onesself too seriously, and plenty of excitement.  This is one of the many Freddy books that adults will enjoy as well.  Gives one a great excuse to read to your child.	2001-05-11

Brooks (its only competition is Freddy the Magician).  Children and adults alike will find this one of the most fun books they've ever read.  I can still remember the delicious chills I felt when reading this book at twelve, and still enjoy reading it today.

The first few books, while entertaining, were before Brooks really reached his stride as a writer, and shortly after this book he was coming down from his peak.  Besides exploring outer space with several friends, Freddy must also help save the Bean family from inlaws who make a plague of locusts look like fun.  Even Brooks'least Freddy book is head and shoulders above most other children's books, and most can be enjoyed by adults as well.	2001-05-10

Brooks.  The earlier books, while terrific for children, are not as entertaining for adults as the later books.  The Freddy books are great moral instruction without ever being preachy, always entertaining.  In this book, the Bean farm animals decide to visit the North Pole.  They have adventures galore on the way and, at the Pole, help save Santa from some well-meaning pirates who are trying to bring efficiency to Santa's workshop. I didn't rate this book higher only because later Freddy books have an even greater appeal.  For children, this should be at least a four-star	2001-05-10
