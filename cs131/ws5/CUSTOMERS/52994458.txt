Our team strives to make them usable. I have always preferred to leave security to the security professional. Maybe that's not working. I suspect there are a lot of other GUI designers, usability folk, project managers, business analysts, and product managers out there arriving at the same conclusion.<br /><br />Have you felt the frustration of working through client interviews, screen reviews, team discussions and iterations of tests to make the most usable possible application -- only to learn that users stumble time and again even getting to your product? User authentication and authorization complaints rank right at the top in most help staff logs. This book may provide some alternatives to passive acceptance of things as they are.<br /><br />It is hard to summarize a 750 page book with over 60 contributors. There is a lot here for a broad range of interests. Yes, some chapters have a load of mind-numbing jargon, but as a whole, this material is very approachable by the professions I mentioned above. Many of the contributors are from the ranks of the same professions. Stats are mixed with anecdotes in an interesting way.<br /><br />Bruce Tognazzini's \\"Design for Usability\\" was a personal favorite -- and so was the chapter on designing the interface to ZoneAlarm, a product familiar to most.<br /><br />If there is one theme that unites all the contributions, it is expressed in the title of Ch. 32: \\"Users Are Not the Enemy.\\" Amen to that.	2005-10-09

This is also a very good book for the veteran scripter who wants to re-tool as DOM-based techniques take hold.<br /><br />I think Jeremy Keith takes the best road when he launches directly into DOM methods and objects, only mentioning the older ways for completeness. Most often, JavaScript books do the opposite -- mentioning DOM scripting only as an advanced art. But why learn the older ways when you must unlearn them later?<br /><br />The author focuses on teaching correct methods and approaches, often taking the long way around to make it easier to see the larger picture. This requires a lot of forethought and organization on the part of an author and here the material excels. I don't think anyone will trip up following this guide through the Web script jungle.<br /><br />The author also avoids the unbearable humor and cutesy language encountered so often in tech books. Thank you Mr. Keith! This is good, clear writing to go with good, clean scripting.<br /><br />Quibbles: I think the author should have been more concerned with compatibility issues, esp. with IE6, the decrepit but still dominant browser. For instance, on pp 200-01, he recommends using the setAttribute() method to set a class but does not mention that IE improperly demands \\"className\\" as a parameter. His snippet would fail in IE. The chapter on CSS scripting was good but barely scratched the surface, not mentioning a bunch of cool scriptable objects.<br /><br />Overall, this book is a worthy tool that should be welcomed by the target audience.	2005-10-06

We can find syntax and approaches so different from the standard practice most of us implement. Unfortunately, the scripters who have grasped the new techniques have shown little interest in explaining the new approach. Their examples published on the Web have a \\"show-offy\\" character that do little to communicate or proselytize.<br /><br />For that reason, I was eager to study this book since it promised to deal with some of the new approaches, including the syntax. I have learned a lot from the author who early on made pains to keep me running apace. Regretfully, the author seemed to be less and less concerned with keeping me with him as the book progressed. The first 4 chapters were the clearest.<br /><br />Part of the problem was mine. Since the book did not seem to be organized in a linear fashion, I skipped Ch. 5 on animation. I design Web applications so I associate animation with script kiddies and popup ad makers. Ch. 6, on form validation, was up my alley but following the author was painful because he kept referring to a variable \\"fV\\" that was defined with a self-referential, bizarrely nested syntax. Only at the end of the chapter did he mention that Ch. 5 first used this syntax. I had to go back to the previous chapter to get a clue. But only a clue because that chapter never really tried to explain why this extremely unconventional approach was used.<br /><br />The author early on tries to make the case that his approach is better than the conventional one. I *think* I agree but as the chapters progressed, he made less and less effort to prove anything at all. I was very disappointed in this. I also did not like the odd way the braces in the scripts were handled. Because he did not line them up well, it was difficult to tell when a section of a script began or ended. The author recognized this in some cases by putting in comments:<br /><br />  }  /* end 'if' */<br /><br />  } /* end 'for' */<br /><br />It would have been better to match braces visibly. Yes, code alignment is a matter of taste so I cannot really hold that against him.<br /><br />Some examples did not work quite as advertised. The type-ahead dropdown script did not work at all in Windows Firefox and worked only erratically in IE.<br /><br />I liked the way the author oriented his examples to user-centered design. Ultimately, the key to the best implementations of JavaScripting is not the syntactical approach but how the functionality fits into the usability of what you are doing.ents: <br />          }  /* end 'if' */ <br />          } /* end 'for' */ <br />It would have been better to match braces visibly.

A lot of work and creativity went into this book but it fails embarrassingly every time the author ventures into the How.<br />The author has much to teach and he does it well with vivid illustrations. His contention that Web widgets often imply assumptions and behaviors with surprising implications is something every Web application designer should pick up on and learn from.<br />Unfortunately, the author veers from his plan to be agnostic on technology and from beginning to end makes implementation recommendations that defy modern practice. It is as if his coding experience ended with Netscape 4 on the Macintosh, a particularly unfortunate combination.<br />He defines \\"traditional HTML\\" in a way that strips it of its current power and dynamism -- and then unfavorably compares it with Flash, naturally enough. Cascading style sheets (CSS) are introduced more as a complication rather than a systematic solution. The first positive mention of CSS is to point out that it can be used to get rid of those horrid link underlines -- a recommendation certain not to please the usability people.<br />The W3C-deprecated and destructive FONT tag is used throughout the book. On page 124, he warns that a drawback to using JavaScript to change form elements is that it forces an entire page refresh. This was true of Netscape 4 but not of any other browser released since 1997. His references to \\"Netscape 5,\\" a version never released to the public, indicates that some of the book is refurbished from old material.<br />Whenever the author gets into implementation, beware. For instance, his suggestion that a 50-item dropdown be divided into two 25-item dropdowns. There are more elegant and usable ways to handle that situation nowadays.<br />Following the author too literally would result in sites and Web applications very expensive to develop, even more expensive to maintain, and with a severely restricted usability.<br />The book ends with illustrations of sites the author considered ennobling. People who make Web interfaces for real people, not for other designers, will find them tediously irritating. The book would have been more valuable if it had covered the widgets of our daily bread a tad more seriously.<br />When it comes to Web design Why's, do as the author says, not as he does.<br />¶erely restricted usability. <br />The book ends with illustrations of sites the author considered ennobling.

Keys to understanding that at once became obvious:<br />1) The book is much more expensive than books with similar content.<br />2) The eloquent Jared Spool, listed as an author, provided only a short preface.<br />3) The book was designed as a college textbook. Who loves or hates a textbook enough to bother to review it?<br />As a classroom aid, the book is superb. Usability principles are presented from foundations to applications clearly and without padding. Unlike many usability texts, statements are backed with ample references. The color illustrations lighten the book sufficiently to soften any textbooky stigma.<br />Each chapter ended with review questions and exercises. Some of them were very interesting and creative, but if you are not in a classroom with an instructor who has access to the password-protected answers, you are on your own.<br />So the Web professional attracted to the material and learning on his own will inevitably feel a bit cheated out of the full value of the book.	2003-11-23

I noticed that when he forgets himself and actually focuses on code, he offers us some excellent material.<br />The problem may be the weak quality control and editing. In Chapter 6, for instance, there were problems in just about every code example. Sometimes the code in the book was correct, but the downloadable file was not. Sometimes the reverse. Sometimes examples worked as designed, even though it was interspersed with rogue or illegal code.<br />As for the annoying patter, let me end with a direct quote. If you can stand 600 pages of that, I admire your fortitude. The author's own comment says it all for me. From p.193:<br />&quot;And is there a method to this madness or an end to this grief? One can never tell, but we hope against hope that the gods in heaven or the mother of all mankind will be kind and have mercy on our fragile souls that we may once again see the sun rise and be glad that another day has been granted us. Huh?...whatever.&quot;<br />Close quote. Indeed.	2003-08-11

Real examples and authorities are cited to take the suggestions beyond the realm of personal opinion. This is a most satisfactory and valuable book.<br />I might not be able to do all the author suggests since the need for speed must be balanced with other costs such as maintainability by development team members, etc. but now I have a much better idea on what those costs are and how to deal with the options available.<br />Sometimes the book introduced terms without defining them but often my confusion was cleared with the concrete code which followed. The book assumes a high comfort level with JavaScript at least and although I had to squint real hard sometimes, I didn't sprain anything serious.<br />Page download and processing speed is a fascinating aspect of our work -- with lots of surprises.<br />Recently I was approached by a team with a particular problem involving manipulating heavy data tables. A solution was proposed based on loads of JavaScripting on cells. We sped this up by maximizing the use of CSS. We sped this up again by scripting on columns instead of cells. Interestingly, a no-script nifty CSS-only solution resulted in the slowest response for the largest tables. Our final solution was one that combined JavaScript with XSL transformations. You learn something new every day.<br />This book has lots of those new things for you.	2003-01-27

I was convinced to buy this book after studying a chapter from this edition which was published at webreference.com.  I found what Goodman had to teach in that chapter (on browser events and cross-browser normalization) to be both understandable and immediately practical.<br />This book is the real deal for those Web workers who are continually asked to get browsers to do more -- and do it in a more complex environment. If you have to deal with the various whimsies and treacheries of IE5, IE6, Netscape 7, Mozilla, and Opera, this is the reference you want.	2002-09-20

This one has some notable strengths and weaknesses.<br />This huge book does indeed cover most DW features but often only lightly. Perhaps the sheer size of it made it hard for me to figure out the organization of the material.<br />I was pleased to see the large number of warnings and tips on DW bugs and pitfalls. Perhaps Macromedia product management would not approve but the average serious reader will love this aspect of the book.<br />As a person who feels more comfortable working the code directly, Ch. 33 &quot;Writing Code in Dreamweaver&quot; is an excellent resource. The extensive section on server-based features &quot;Dynamic Dreamweaver&quot; was also valuable.<br />The book's example code gets bad marks for W3C standards compliance. Learn the tool from this book, not the code. The authors constantly used example code using deprecated tags and techniques. Ch. 9 &quot;Building Tables&quot; was especially bad in this respect. The authors were so eager to teach us the wasteful practice of using tables for layout that they neglected completely to show us DW's extremely powerful and labor-saving features for manipulating true data tables. Ch. 10 followed in the same vein.<br />The authors broke up the material with lots of interviews with people like us, people working the Web. This was a great idea and added impact and motivation to the book.	2002-09-12

In addition, I cheerfully choose to ignore his gracious yet wholly unexpected and aberrant judgment in mentioning my name in the acknowledgements.<br />If you are a person who frequents Internet newsgroups, listservs, and online forums related to Web work, you cannot have missed the word of mouth that is going around about this book. The praise is from all ranges of Web design experience and it is well-deserved.<br />I don't need to outline the book's contents. The editorial reviews and the information on the book's web site do that in detail. Eric has also made the code available to people who do not buy the book. But if you just work the code, you will be missing the book's motivation, warnings, tips, advice, colorful layout, and wit that make the code pop.<br />Eric, right from the outset, shows you how to combine both elementary and advanced style techniques. He leads you to do this in such a natural, seamless way that at different stages in each project you realize with a start that you just worked a bit of magic!<br />A long time ago, working in a huge factory in Pittsburgh, I tagged along as a helper to a mechanic who was massive and muscular. I fully expected prodigious feats of brute strength from the man. None were to be seen. His favorite saying was &quot;If you have to use force, you must be doing something wrong.&quot;  Eric calmly cuts through the clutter and makes it all look easy with just that spirit.<br />I want to make an appeal to those Web workers, such as myself, who code exclusively for the Internet Explorer browser: from time to time Eric will invite you to follow along in another advanced browser, such as Mozilla or Netscape 6, to see effects not yet supported by IE. You will richly profit from the opportunity. By the time future versions of the Microsoft browser support the standards that Eric is showing, you will be way ahead of the game.<br />&quot;Eric Meyer on CSS&quot; is destined to be on the must-have list of *everyone* who wants to stay ahead in this ever-changing Web game.he Microsoft browser support the standards that Eric is showing, you will be way ahead of the game.<br />&quot;Eric Meyer on CSS&quot; is destined to be on the must-have list of *everyone* who wants to stay ahead in this ever-changing Web game.	2002-07-27

Although there are some gems among the projects in this book for any Web professional, the ones who will surely get the most from this book are those who were trained in the old Photoshop \\"slice and dice\\" school. Adept in turning a page into an assembly of graphics-laden table cells, they are a bit threatened by all this CSS furor and wonder why the experts say tables are so bad.<br />If you are one of those people, this book is definitely for you. The author seems to be a former practitioner of Photoshop Phascism herself (one of the book's 14 projects has 71 graphics!) so she knows where you're coming from.<br />She also knows where you have to get to create modern, clean, easily-maintained code.<br />Most of the projects are interesting in themselves and with copious illustrations, easy steps, and thoughtful side notes, you should have no trouble following along.<br />I also really liked the way the code in the accompanying CD was presented. Each directory had an index file with a separate link to each important step. Note: There was often a disconnect between the label in this index and the label used in the book but this did not present an obstacle.<br />There was a bit of a lapse in testing some of the files before publication. The finished files for projects 3 and 9 did not open in IE6/Windows. The problem was infinite looping caused by the script meant to deal with an infirmity in decrepit old Netscape 4...another reason why this browser should be left behind.<br />There was another odd lapse for a book that is very free of errors: No, there is no CURSOR property value of ARROW.<br />One further warning to more advanced Web workers: the reference to DOM in the title may give you the impression that the scripting is the new W3C DOM \\"node-speak.\\"  It is not. Neither is it missed here, because script is not the focus of this fine book. The focus is on good HTML structure and artful styling. If that is your focus too, then this book is for you.	2002-06-06

This is a solid book for the *serious* beginning or intermediate Web worker who recognizes that CSS is -and will be- a technique essential to their career.<br />The authors do a great service in emphasizing the role of proper HTML structure. Without that understanding, CSS is merely decoration instead of an integral aspect of Web-building.<br />The authors make more effort to deal with backwards compatibility issues (meaning the decrepit Netscape 4) than I think necessary. But at no point do they cater to that browser. They completely avoid wasteful hacks such as tables for layout and 1-pixel .gif tricks.<br />The authors guide the reader in all the best modern practices, avoiding the old hacks, to create structurally logical and human-readable code -- code that looks nice and displays in new ways.<br />It's been a long time coming but finally the right Web coding practices are coming to the fore, with the help of books such as this.	2002-06-01

This book may not be so bad for an absolute beginner if there were an instructor present for elaboration, follow-through, and correction.  The author *does* at least hit on many of the key points one should be aware of.<br />The book avoids all progress in web design technique worked out since 1996. There is no mention of HTML as a structural language rather than presentational.  In the author's world, the efficiencies and power of Cascading Style Sheets just do not exist.<br />The author shows his print world bias by recommending serif fonts for content (p.59).  Not only is this an extreme minority viewpoint on the Web, it is very irresponsible to present this as accepted without presenting the majority point of view.<br />The author also includes lots of old information and even grossly wrong information.  He states that the average user is viewing a screen at 72dpi. A Web design expert should not be totally unaware that we in Windows have always been at 96dpi and even the new Macs (the obvious preference of the author) default to 96dpi.<br />All right, not worth going on and on here. The book is pretty. Lots of flowing, colorful, Gaelic-style graphics.<br />Another beautiful book best admired from afar.	2002-05-03

Yes, the book showed certain evidence of haste in editing and proofing but the errors and weaknesses are not of the type to cause an early adopter to stumble. For instance, there is no index but chapters are distinct enough so that it is easy to find the broad categories.<br />I eagerly picked up this book after attending a very impressive demo of Curl's capacities. Only skimming the two chapters on Object Oriented Programming, I concentrated on the other chapters most relevant to GUI developers of Web-based applications.<br />Being an ardent practitioner of the W3C's Cascading Style Sheets technology, I was a bit disappointed in Curl's implementation of styles, which seems clumsy and very limited, even considering the differences in syntax.  The authors were very knowledgeable on HTML and CSS issues -- which made their reliance on tables for layout a bit disturbing. Does this indicate that Curl lacks equivalents for CSS positioning and layout properties -- or merely that the authors did not happen to see this as important enough to include in examples?<br />I was dissatisfied with the paucity of examples and the fact that these examples were not of the type of depth to glue the various parts of Curl together.  There were some good examples involving 2-D and 3-D graphics which showed the technology to advantage. However, if your primary interest is in form-based Web applications, the examples were sketchy.<br />The book really needs to have context. Criticism of Java, HTML, JavaScript, etc. is not enough.<br />The authors must speak more directly to the questions:<br />{}Does the Web world need another proprietary, Java-like browser plug-in?<br />{}Does the Curl organization have what it takes to go against Microsoft's .NET, which has a similar architecture and revenue model?<br />Answer these questions and you not only have a good book, but a real cool winning tool.a good book, but a real cool winning tool.	2002-02-22

You are sufficiently warned early on when the author acknowledges that he prefers to use a simple text editor rather than the productivity tools (Homesite, BBEdit, Dreamweaver) experienced Web designers must use to construct sites with the speed, quantity, and accuracy necessary in their jobs.<br />The scripts resemble transcriptions from a professor's lecture notes. These are not lively, practical examples that you can modify immediately to enrich site usability by presenting the maximum amount of information and interactivity with minimum navigation.<br />That weakness is highlighted in Ch. 18 when the author dramatically warms to the subject of Flash ActionScript. The pulse of real world situations beats strongly in this chapter and I wish the other chapters had the same immediacy.<br />The last one-third of the book is dominated by server-side scripting. If you don't have your own server or do not know how to set one up, you won't be able to follow along. I believe this is a serious failing in a book clearly directed at the &quot;front-end&quot; worker.<br />And if you are as old as I am, you will find the editor's decision to use a tiny, red font for the most important lines of code to be a bit painful.	2002-01-15

His last book on the practice of simplicity was just a tease. Workers charged with the responsibility of making Web GUIs need more than pontification with sparse metrics and predictions of how great monitors \\"will be\\" in 2001.<br />Nielsen and co-author Tahir have come down from the mountain and produced a book that is as usable as they come:<br />(1) Take a site (you'll recognize a bunch) and give an overview in terms of what it is trying to accomplish.<br />(2) Show metrics and comparisons on how screen space and controls are used.<br />(3) Begin the fun in earnest with specific recommendations and focused criticism. The devil is in the details, and here is where we come away with the stuff that makes this book a valuable bargain. Opinions and advice Fortune 500 companies pay wads for are ours for the price of a book.<br />You don't have to agree with Nielsen on anything at all. I battle usability questions daily at work and know the trade-offs in every GUI decision. Nielsen is neither right nor wrong -- but he is certainly listened to by any Web worker who must come to grips with these issues.<br />By the way, the construction of the book itself is spectacular.

Because you learned well and fast, you made a living from HTML. The Web grew so explosively partly because we were all learning that way.<br />Now imagine the same thing happening in Web graphics. A text-based graphics format, with source open for all to learn. SVG, as an application of XML, brings the potential of data-driven graphics to the Web. The graphic is the data and the data is the graphic, cutting out all middle layers.<br />This is not a book about pretty pictures, although it is well illustrated. It is code-centric and by necessity focuses on SVG tags and attributes.<br />The author expertly leads us in easy steps. The book is surprisingly easy to read. The author often changes tempo, removing us for a moment from the code and infusing a relaxed perspective, despite his obvious enthusiasm for this technology.<br />The author assumes a basic understanding of XML syntax and some knowledge of applied cascading style sheets (CSS). XLink and XPointer are covered only to the extent necessary for linking in SVG, for instance. CSS, designed for XML applications as much as for HTML, is used from the very beginning, displaying once again the ability of CSS to multiply the power and flexibility of any tagging system it is joined to.<br />The typography of the book, and the modest but effective use of color, contributes to the clarity of the exposition. The beginner should be aware that to follow along in the book, it is necessary to download freely available graphics tools and browser plug-ins almost 7 megabytes in total.<br />SVG is a graphics format unlike anything you have ever seen. It has not yet taken center stage in Web development -- but it will. Will you be ready or will you be playing catch up?	2001-10-28

The examples and illustrations are presented in a workmanlike fashion and are quite clear.<br />-Do not buy this book if you want to see current advanced techniques in action and learn the bread-winning skills of tomorrow.<br />The book is a collaboration of several authors, with content organized into various projects, such as 'Providing Online Customer Support' and 'Setting Up a Storefront.'<br />The authors get high marks for what they unanimously preached: Build your site upon validated HTML or XHTML; separate structure from presentation through the use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to control fonts, colors, and layout.<br />The authors get low marks for what they unanimously practiced: Design your site with nested tables for layout, mocking the spirit of W3C coding recommendations; build to the weaknesses of Netscape 4; use JavaScript to write HTML, vitiating the separation of structure from content; use CSS merely to &quot;spice up&quot; your site, not transform it into sleek, modern efficiency.<br />The quality of project content was mixed. Holzschlag's 'Managing a Weekly Publication' was a delight to read for its description of the sources of the many compromises one must make with site code. Unfortunately, her project also began the litany of 1-pixel gifs to buttress the shaky edifice of old-fashioned nested tables.<br />Kuhlman's 'Creating a Complex Community Site' was a strong contribution, with clear instructions for the beginner in setting up an Apache server and using PHP.<br />Schmitt's projects were less valuable and an exercise in self-aggrandizement. Attend: 'Showcasing a Corporate (his own) Identity' which managed to show how to make a logo in Photoshop without ever really showing it in a lavishly illustrated book; and 'Designing a Great Personal (his own) Site.'<br />And yes, the book is extremely well illustrated. The organization is a bit confusing since the Table of Contents does not list chapters and each section is a numbered project but the example code files in the book's Web site are named by (non-existing) chapter. One can only guess. Each &quot;chapter's&quot; code must be downloaded separately and is composed almost entirely of code snippets, not whole pages --so you cannot see the code in action-- and these snippets have no listing numbers in the illustrations, so once again, you must open many files to find the code you want.<br />The authors are acutely aware of the current technology/style discussions and debates. They provide links to the sharpest, most relevant documents and sites. If you are just beginning, the lessons in those links will have you in the thick of it in no time!<br />I gave this book a 4 rating since it is far better than the average book on WWW site construction and HTML. You may decide I was too generous - or not.g since the Table of Contents does not list chapters and each section is a numbered project but the example code files in the book's Web site are named by (non-existing) chapter.

XSL transformations operate unlike any other programming or document transformation language. For most of us, it is a jarring agony to learn.<br />The book starts at the basics in a non-abstract way (unlike the Kay book) and builds your knowledge from the simple to the complex. The author's real-world experience shows to great effect here. He will take an example and build on it, not only illuminating new techniques, but thereby showing the power of XSLt to transform the same data in multiple ways.<br />The CD is worth its weight in gold. It is very convenient to have the code on hand of course, but the author goes beyond that. You get each definition in the W3C specification accompanied by an example with suggestions to alter the example to deepen your understanding.<br />One weakness of the presentation is that readers are left to their own devices in downloading, installing, and learning a transformation engine to actually carry out experiments. This is a weakness in a book so superbly directed at the beginning and intermediate level.<br />By the way, the slap at the quality of English in this book is completely false and is probably what prompted me to write this review in the first place.	2001-05-31

Through the influence of the new W3C Document Object Model and the powerful technique of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), modern HTML is far more robust and easy to maintain than in the past. Even the generally excellent Dreamweaver Bible does not deal with CSS until Chapter 27, and then only as something separate from &quot;real&quot; HTML.<br />Sparber and crew know otherwise. They burst out of the starting gate with Chapter 1 &quot;Using CSS to Make Selectable Themes&quot; and never look back.<br />If you are serious about Web work and serious about your Dreamweaver tool, this book will take you to a new level and you won't look back either. Have fun!	2001-05-23

Excellent flow, excellent examples and a real feel for getting your point across to script idiots like me. I have given away all my other JavaScript books.<br />Not only is the book superbly designed and written, it is also edited and proofed in a manner qualitatively superior to most computer books. Let's hope the book is not a fluke and we get other fine products from the team who put this book together.<br />I join others in saying this is a book not for beginners only. Wilton (unlike other JavaScript authors) deals with the newest W3C DOM standards and techniques with clarity and authority.<br />Serious Web worker - buy this book!	2001-04-07

With every property of CSS level 2 explained in a compact manner -including examples- the book can be a real time saver.<br />Eric's experience in the application of this advanced technique and his participation in the Web community is expressed in the organization and clarity of this book. No hand-holding tutorials here, just the facts and the context which gives those facts meaning.<br />And if that is not compact enough for you, Chapter 8 &quot;CSS2 Quick Reference,&quot; condenses the material even more. Also handy is the lengthy chart on browser compatibility.<br />I can only fault the book for not going beyond its purpose. That is, the book covers the CSS specification properties only. In particular, styles implemented by Internet Explorer, which may be extremely handy yet not officially approved, are not covered.	2001-04-04

Apparently the author knows a thing or two about good instruction.<br />I got a good overview and some new insights into WBT development. The book is  probably most valuable to training executives and managers than to  courseware designers and developers.<br />There were lots of valuable project  walkthroughs, which conveyed a good feel for all aspects of the process of  creating web-based training programs. It includes good discussions of  project management and how to create proposals to motivate the projects in  the first place. I can see where Hall's focus on return on investment and  how each affected worker in the project may react positively or negatively  to aspects of WBT.<br />The book has the best and most concrete explanation of  storyboarding that I have seen.<br />The technical stuff was pretty good,  despite the fact that the book is old (mid-1997) and tools, plug-ins, and  development environments have changed a lot since those ancient times. For  instance, by &quot;browser&quot; he really means Netscape, which in the  spring of 1997 had an 87% market share and represented hot technology. Now,  we have the advantage of not only of a more advanced browser, but also more  advanced international standards in browser authoring, such as Dynamic HTML  and Cascading Style Sheets.	1999-11-19

This book offers a very comprehensive treatment of the abilities of the Internet Explorer browser and the power of the latest technical standards of the World Wide Web Consortium. The text and accompanying CD are full of  vivid examples of underlying principles. Many examples can be applied  directly in real-world situation.<br />Be prepared for some important  frustrations. The author, after whetting the appetite with a fine bit of  code, continually refers the reader to a &quot;Quick Reference&quot; for  complete code properties. This reference does not exist in the book or CD.  He refers to important subject matter in &quot;Chapter 24&quot; which also  does not exist - nor does that subject matter appear in any other part of  the book. Some subsidiary material is included on the CD in Adobe PDF  format. To present Dynamic HTML and scripting in this flat and passive way  is like showing a person how to swim using a picture of water and a diagram  of strokes.<br />These problems reflect lack of attention on the part of the  publisher, not the author, whose enthusiasm and range of knowledge are  admirable.<br />Another sign of improper attention on the part of the  publisher is the large number of broken scripts. For instance, in Chapter  5, Listings 5-14, 5-15, 5-17 and 5-19, do not work. Troubleshooting found  the problems involved improper use of quotes and misplaced or unbalanced  braces. These are minor errors in the typesetter's art but showstoppers in  the scripter's world. A book of this sort needs to be subjected to rigorous  technical editing.<br />This book is worth the investment in time and money  for anyone serious about using the latest standards and techniques in the  Internet/Intranet environments.	1999-09-12
US	52994458	R1EB953YAQWWFM	1576102114	274715879	HTML Style Sheets Design Guide: The Web Professional's Guide to Building and Using Style Sheets	Books	1	7	7	N	N	Poor value technically but pretty.	Don't be seduced by this book's lavish cover or large-format, its 60-page  color section or the considerable writing experience of the three authors.  This book's potentially timely and valuable information is crippled by the  publisher's decision to get this book on the shelves without benefit of the  least editorial proofing.<br />Page after page of obvious problems completely  undermine your confidence in the technical content. Statements like  &quot;The Times font is probably the most commonly used font written in  languages using Arabic letters.&quot; (p114) surely won't convince you that  the authors have something to teach you in the way of fontfaces.<br />Poorly  thought-out and unimaginative illustrations have only a tenuous relation to  text. Sometimes they have no relation. On p105, the authors  &quot;illustrate&quot; the block nature of a list-item with a picture of  Felix the Cat in a non-browser window labelled &quot;Animated Gifs&quot;.  Another example shows us Lotus Notes instead of  Netscape.<br />It is clear  that technical facts have not been thoroughly checked. This is very  important in an area where published standards are not completely  implemented and there are wide variations in the type of implementation  across browsers and platforms. We are told that &quot;font size (sic) and  font weight (tsk tsk) are abbreviated using the slash (12pt/14pt).&quot;  No, font-size and line-height are abbreviated that way.<br />The book is  poorly indexed, but that is normal for computer books. What is abnormal is  that the color section, about one-third of the book, has not been indexed  at all! Especially amusing was the 5 full-color pages gushing about Time  Magazine's exemplary use of style sheets *without one line* of code to back  up the authors' esteem.<br />No, this is one beautiful book best admired from  afar.	1998-08-30
