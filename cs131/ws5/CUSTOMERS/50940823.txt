First a rain tasting like semen wakes up a Molly who has a religious experiences with coyotes at the front door. Then the dead begin quoting T.S. Elliot. Then alien fungus warps people's minds and make them cut themselves. The aliens can morph through walls and steal people's faces.<br /><br />Molly and her husband Neil are on a mission to save the children at Black Lake, with the help of understanding dogs. For some reason they are immune to the aliens. Well not really immune they are left alone and at times even protected by them as they rescue terrified children trapped in houses and churches.<br /><br />I like the houses with the living things in the walls. There must of been one hell of a party in the basement of the 'Tail of the Wolf' bar. An insane father who kills children is also good for some spooks. I dug this book, it made me want to go out and shoot mushrooms with my shotgun.	2005-03-03

I don't really know what to make of this book, except that it is an amateurish result.<br /><br />We start off with a terrorist of some kind stealing two nuclear bombs off of a train. So it starts off exciting, but after that it goes pretty much downhill. The main character is a newspaper reporter and this book is his memoirs of events that happened while involved with a religiously fanatic group that pland to nuke an underground bumker in West Virginia. The author/character even tells us that he has no idea on how to write this. He puts chapters in order of 'feelings' instead of linear events.<br /><br />While he's with the Christian Cult, we also get to read chapters about Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. It seems the reporter went to Japan to interview survuvors from 50 years ago. We read this in the middle of chapters of the present day where White Supremists are robbing banks to finance their terrorist activities.<br /><br />One thing I'll say, this 40ish middle-aged guy sure doesn't seem to have a problem getting laid. All the women seem to fall for him; married Japanese interpretors, a gravestone cutter who has sex with him when they meet the second time, and even the daughter of the Cult Preacher. This guy is just a stud.<br /><br />What I don't understand is why Eva went in to rob the bank with him knowing she was being set up to die, why he went along in the helicopter with the Marine Gunny to drop the nuke in the Atlantic. (The Gunny even needed his advice to strap a pick up truck underneath a flying helicopter.)<br /><br />The author of this book thinks rather highly of himself as he was putting himself in the shoes of his hero. I wish I could live in a world where overweight guys are chick magnets.<br /><br />Disappointing ending to a book that has too many side stories.	2005-03-01

She can touch the soul with her music and with complicated orchestry she won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.<br /><br />Samantha Fox bears her soul in this book. We can see how the musical genious labors for endless hours to produce a song for us cattle who love and adore her. She does have a Masters Degree in Music Theory and a PhD in Music History, but that shouldn't stop anyone from reading this book. Samantha breaks it down so we, the uneducated, can understand the complicated process that entails creating a song like 'Touch Me (I Want your Body)'.<br /><br />Many people think that Samantha Fox simply has her songs written for her by the third rate hip hop gang calling themselves Full Force. This is not true at all. Samantha is as humble as she is talanted and beautiful. Full Force is actually a group of homeless people that Samantha took in. She fed them, clothed them, and gave them legitamite jobs. One guy is partially retarded and all he can do is 'Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha Fox!'. Yes that's him. HE can't even pee by himself. Samantha gave them song writing credits. SOme say it was a clever tax maneuver, but we all know it was out of the goodness of her heart. Maybe the Pope will make her a saint some day and cannonize her 'St. Samantha Fox, Patron Saint of the Street Musicians'.<br /><br />Samantha Fox is a true Renaisance Woman. Her work will be enjoyed for countless generations.	2005-01-15

Frank is missed not just because of his incredible musical talent, but his biting satire type sense of humor.<br /><br />The man was a genious though. I have no doubt about that. He also saw things 20 years ago that we didn't. Doesn't anyone who's read this book realize that Frank predicted downloading music 20 years before Napster or the Internet? He thought it would be done through cable TV. It was the same principle!<br /><br />If anyone really wants to know and try to understand the man behind the music.

Next came TV (I saw the Geraldo episode), posters, video games, etc.<br /><br />No women were ever so beautiful, so gorgeous, so breathtakingly beautiful.

His whiskers have stand straight up, go straight out, and everything in between. There is some some dialogue that is nothing more than questions and answers. For instance, it is asked why Dali paints. On the next page his mustache is shaped like an 'S' and there are two paint brushes running across his face to complete the dollar sign '$'.<br /><br />I love this book because I am a big fan of Dali. Also my daughter has come to love it and usually asks for this book for her bedtime story. It makes her giggle because some of the pictures are just so strange. Although the picture of Dali as the Mona Lisa is quite disturbing.<br /><br />The book can be read in under three minutes, but for fans of \\"The Dali\\" it can bring a lifetime of pleasure.	2004-12-07

Somewhere in between \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" and \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is \\"The Five People you Meet in Heaven\\".<br /><br />Eddie grew up poor while his father worked the amusement park. Eddie wanted to be an engineer and get out of where he grew up and take the love of his life with him. Unfortunately World War II got in the way of his plans. Wounded, he returned home with a bad leg and spent the rest of his life continuing in his father's footsteps.<br /><br />The Five people he met were people he had both known and not known in his life, but they all had an influence on him, or he influenced them without their knowledge. He never met 'The Blue Man', but learned from him how he was indirectly responsible for his death. He also meets his Commanding Officer from the War, his wife, the woman whose husband built the park, and finally a young girl who he was never sure existed, but did.<br /><br />This book is full of sentiment, which isn't a bad thing. We need books like this along with the Stephen Kings and V.C. Andrews of the world. It deals with friendship, relationships, and had much to do with understanding an uncaring father.<br /><br />After I finished the book I thought it was a nice story, though had a bit of a strange ending. If Heaven is different for everybody, I'm sure I'll end up on a beach just as Eddie got his Ferris Wheel.	2004-11-18

With a dry British humor throughout, you'll enjoy the interesting characters. Crawly who was the snake from Eden loves his Bently car, Queen's greatest hits, and the Earth in general. Along with an angel, he wants to stop the Battle of Armegeddon for two reasons; he loves the Earth (except for the boring 14th Century) and the alternative is Hell of course and he's trying to avoid it.<br /><br />The Witch Hunter Sergeant is a hoot and by far the most colorful and funny character. With phrases such as \\"How many nipples ye got laddie?\\" you can't help but love him.<br /><br />The anti-Christ named Adam was switched at birth at the Satanic order of the Chattering nuns hospital, but it was a botched job. You really got to read the book to appreciate this part.<br /><br />Of course no book about Armegeddon would be complete without a visit from space aliens, Tibetans tunneling through the earth, a high speed chase through phone lines, and a 'nice' book that tells the future.<br /><br />Of course it was genious for the Four Horsemen to trade in their horses for Motorcycles. War (a hot babe), Death, Famine, and Pollution (Pestellance retired) now wear Hell's Angels jackets. But can they really get to the nuclear power plant before a floating moped carrying a prostitute possessed by an angel and the witch-hunter?	2004-11-17

From boyhood, teen, and adult years I have never seemed to outgrow the adventures of Tom Sawyer. Some of my favorite parts of the book are when there are no adventures at all and it's just every day life. For instance the Sunday morning church service cannot be called an adventure, but Mark Twain made it come to life with Tom's stumbling in front of the Sunday school after trading for tickets. David and Goliath indeed. Of course no service would be complete without the dog and the 'pinchbug'.<br /><br />Every boy has a Becky Thatcher sometime in his life and it's fun to look back at your own childhood as you relive Tom's romantic exploits through his eyes and your own.<br /><br />Of course Tom's adventures wouldn't be complete without his bosom pal Huck Finn. They become pirates on Jackson Island, witness a murder, and find buried treasure in a haunted house.<br /><br />With other colorful characters like Muff Potter, Injun Joe, Aunt Polly, and the school master (\\"Who tore this book!!!\\"), this book by Mark Twain will live forever and be a favorite for adults and children alike.<br /><br />And remember, anyone who lies will steal sheep!	2004-11-04

I flipped through it half expecting it to be a coloring book. In any other country Miss Lords would starve, but here in America she is a porn star, actress, singer, exercise and fitness spokesperson, and now author? Come on already.<br /><br />I remember Traci from my adult film collection I had in the 80's. Of course when everyone found out she was 16, all her movies disappeared from the shelves. Then when she turned 18 she made the now impossible to find 'Traci I love you' video which has one of the most hardcore gang bang ever filmed.<br /><br />She went on to make terrible B movies and her greatest claim to fame as an 'actress' was in STephen King's made for TV movie 'TommyKnockers'. You may also remember her from a few episodes of Married...with Children' which featured quite a few porn stars.<br /><br />After buying and reading this book as a joke, I realized Traci is as thin and one dimensional as the paper her story is written on. She is a complete airhead who expects everyone to give her whatever she wants. If she had any talant or at least a personality it would be understandable, but she has none of these. I can't really feel any sympathy for a girl who is eating in the cafeteria at high school and all the boys know her from adult magazines.<br /><br />Traci you are the American Dream.

Books	5	11	23	N	N	For the most part represents the opinion of non-sheep USA	Let's face it, there will never be someone you agree with totally, espescially when it comes to religion and politics. Though I agree somewhat with MM's political views, his religious viewpoint I spit on. I remember reading in his 'Stupid White Men' book that he thought everyone in Ireland should convert to Catholicism, I thought he was a complete buffoon for writing something so stupid. Although in that book I agreed with every Bush bashing word. Mr. Moore is Catholic and I have nothing against Catholics personally, I just don't agree with them. I wonder why Michael Moore always feels like he has to mix religion and politics (leave that to Bush!)<br />In Chapter 6 Michael Moore writes as if he is God himself. God is interrupting Mike Moore to add input to Himself. Cute idea, but I doubt God feels that way about abortion, His Son Jesus, or raunchy sex. I doubt God is a liberal and thinks homosexuality is OK. Go read a Bible Mike.<br />Politically his views are sound, Bush is an insane imbecile who doesn't know what he's doing, his supporters are idiots, and the world is going to hell in a handbasket quicker than you can say 9-11. I know I'll never be rich, I don't trust the stock market, and yes I will probably see my pension and benefits whittle down to nothing by the time I retire.<br />For every Bush backing Republican, I challange you to read this book. If you believe only half of what is written here, you have some soul searching to do. Look in the mirror and come to grips with what GW really is, nothing but a name. A name that made it's fortune from the Nazi party, and Arabs.<br />Great book, but Mike please keep your religious views to yourself, you can't write about both and get full support from everyone you are trying to reach. I believe you'd be even more successful expressing your political views if you keep your Catholic views to yourself. I will admit that at times I think Mike goes off the deep end way, way, way to far left. I really don't want Oprah Winfrey as president. Also I am white and want to live in a white community. That's my American dream and if Mike doesn't like that, then screw him.Winfrey as president. Also I am white and want to live in a white community.

Can you believe this man declares war? Can you believe this man considers himself a torch of hope for the world's oppressed? For those who think that the end of the world has come fear not. The Book of Revelation in the BIble clearly states that the anti-Christ will be a 'handsome and well spoken man'. At least we're somewhat safe for now.<br />Though this book can be a bit cumbersome, (you have to turn the book upside-down after each question to read the correct answer) the answers will ASTOUND you. Read what came from Bush's own lips as he answered questions about Vietnam, his military service, and his many failed business ventures. But the one question that is truly sad and heartbreaking is as follows. It was asked by a grade school girl...<br />Q. Mr. Bush, what was your favorite book when you were a child?<br />A.

It's rabid following has never gotten over the disappearance of Opus and the Gang from the funny papers. That's because nothing has ever been able to take it's place. Could you imagine Opus, Bill, Steve, and Milo tackling today's issues? What besides G.W. Bush and Saddam would be in the anxiety closet. Alas, we can only remember the good times.<br />This is one of my favorite Bloom County books. It mostly took on an issue that has always been important to me, rock n roll. The gang takes on the PMRC by forming their own metal band Deathtongue. After battling Washington though, Steve Dallas caves in and Billy and the Boingers is born.<br />Long live live Opus.

I admit I'm addicted to his kooky little tracts because some of them are just hysterical. My favorite one is 'Angels'. Did you know that Satan is behind music? He started with Chuck Berry and Elvis, then The Beatles, then Black Sabbath, KISS, and Motley Crue. If you listen to rock n roll you will burn forever in a lake of FIE. Haw haw!<br />But seriously, I have to admit some of those tracts changed my life (along with my God-fearing wife who has never read or even heard of Jack Chick). Maybe salvation through a comic book may seem ridiculous, it's only a seed. What Jack T. Trick tracts did for me was give me the courage to read the Bible and search for the answers for myself. I was raised Catholic. I went to mass every week, took communion, went to confession, went to CCD, and had my Confirmation. Then when I was 16 I started working and never went to church again for the next 10 years. The Catholic Church did nothing for me and meant nothing to me. Sure I said the Rosary and prayed to Mary, but now I know it's wrong. I blamed God for my problems, I know that's wrong too.<br />Jack Chick did not save my soul, Jesus did. But Jack did open the door and set me on a path to find Jesus on my own. For that I thank him.<br />To any Catholic reading this. I was once like you. I thought the Catholic Church was the way, it is not. Read this or any 'anti-Catholic' Chick tract you can get your hands on. There is a website online where you can read every single one ever written. It's called 'The Jack Chick Museum of Fine Art'. Read a few tracts and you will find yourself questioning the Catholic religion. I'm Baptist now, I'm still a sinner and far from perfect, but Jesus knows me.	2004-03-01

With his 1977 solo debut, he could have been a legend outside of KISS. Instead he succumbed to two things; laziness and alcohol. Ace used to be a hero of mine. As a guitar player he's still a big influence on me, but as a human being, even if half of these stories are true, he's been knocked off his pedastal a notch or two.<br />The stories in here are amazing. Like how he walked through Gene Simmon's hotel room, goose-stepping in a Nazi uniform. According to the book, Ace is a racist who doesn't like 'the two Jews' (Gene and Paul). Supposedly he made the famous KISS logo as a slap in the face to them. Unless you've lived under a rock your whole life, you'll know that the KISS logo features the double lightning bolt SS that the Nazis used.<br />The funniest story in the book is when Ace sat in a hotel room all night autographing plain white hats. Then he ironed patches onto plain white T-shirts. This was all supposed to be merchandise for an upcoming gig. Well after all his work, no one bought them because they couldn't believe Ace signed them.<br />The keyboard player and hairdresser who wrote this book come off as a couple of losers themselves though. They hung out with Ace, got the short end of the stick, and are now mad. The hairdresser even claimed he almost killed Ace with a baseball bat when they were kids. Ace escaped injury because he was fast on his feet.<br />Mr. G.G.G.G. comes off as a whiny wannabe who's keyboard skills did not take him as far as he had hoped. Hey if you lose your job and get your wife all mad at you because you decided to hangout with Ace in Atlantic City all weekend, who's fault is it?<br />It's a good read, but beware Ace fans. Ace is not the happy-go-lucky, drunken, fun loving buffoon he's portrayed to be. He's a lazy musician with a weird open marriage, and seems to have little respect for fans. How else would you explain a millionaire bitching about not getting a free computer from a young fan?<br />If I was Ace and owned a mansion with a state of the art studio in the basement, I'd have put out a lot more than four solo albums in 30 years.rom a young fan?<br />If I was Ace and owned a mansion with a state of the art studio in the basement, I'd have put out a lot more than four solo albums in 30 years.	2004-02-19

Anyone caught in it's spell could not possibly not want to read the sequel and see what happened to the three children that escaped the clutches of the Attic and their evil grandmother.<br />Well........for one this story is a bit far fetched. Did V.C. Andrews even write this? Didn't she die after 'Flowers' and has had a ghost writer for the last twenty years? Anyway they leave the attic and get on a bus, headed for Sarasota, Florida to join the circus. Instead they run into a mute housekeeper who takes them to her employer, a doctor. As in real life, this complete stranger befriends the three of them. He adopts Carrie, sends Chris through medical school and helps Cathy follow her dream of being a ballerina.<br />In the course of this of course, the doc falls in love with Cathy while Chris is still in love with her sister.<br />The great confrontation which ends in a disappointing anti-climax is when Cathy meets her grandmother again. You remember 'Flowers'? The hate, the fear, the helplessness. Remember how badly we wanted Cathy to get away? Well now the shoe is on the other foot. After a stroke, the grandmother lays helpless, though alert. Cathy stands over her with a switch and strips the helpless grandmother. The anger is burning in Cathy's eyes. The fear is in the grandmother's.....<br />I'll stop here. You just have to see what happens. I for one was disappointed.<br />The story ends with a great fire that destroys the mansion and it's evil, forboding attic.	2004-01-13

I was so in love with Cathy in 'Flowers'. But I cannot believe she died in that damn attic while making a purple paper worm. A terrible ending. But on the other hand, she never really escaped the attic did she? But then again on the OTHER hand, why would she agree to live in that mansion in the first place after the dreaded estate was rebuilt? When it was announced that it would be rebuilt, she should have had a fit and refused to see it through.<br />You can only take so much from these books; Uncle Joel, learning to paint in bed while paralyzed. Oh boy I'm glad the series is over. All in all, 'Flowers' and 'Petals' were the only two that really moved me.	2004-01-13

But after reading Garden of Shadows the hate doesn't burn as much. She had her own miserable existance once she came to Foxworth. Faking a pregnancy, living without love, the death of her children. The symbolic dollhouse and it's porcelin tenants open a profound door into the woman's soul.<br />Who would have believed she wanted to take Cathy and Cris into her arms the day they arrived at that cursed attic?<br />A fascinating read.	2004-01-13

Andrews (if she really wrote this or if it was her 'ghost') wrote this story to stand on it's own. It is a complete novel, not part of a series. If you are not familiar with V.C. Andrew's or her masterpiece 'Flowers in the Attic', you may enjoy this dark tale between a father and his daughter. If you are familiar with her, this story gives itself away just because you know V.C. wrote it.	2004-01-13

Some of us are the tree, some of us are the boy, some of us have been both, but most have been something in between. I first read this book as a child, I never forgot it. My daughter absolutely loves it (though she is too young to fully understand it. She cried the first time I read it when the boy cut the tree down.)<br />I was a tree to someone once. I gave and gave and was never fully appreciated. Many years later, there is a deep regret for the both of us. Children may love this story as just that, a story about a boy and a tree. But most adults who have been in relationships will sadly see themselves as one or the other.<br />Regardless of what many people have written here about this book, I think it's beautiful. I don't think anyone who ever reads it can ever forget it.	2003-10-01

Books	2	18	38	N	N	Another idiot's 15 minutes worth of fame	Michael Moore is also a `stupid white man'. To suggest that everyone in Ireland converts to Catholicism is the most ridiculous thing ever to be published. I am not a Bush fan, and that is as nicely as I can put it.... Oh all right, I hate him. But Michael Moore is really no better. Could you imagine this guy as president? He reminds me a little of that buffoon Rush Limbaugh. He claims to have all the answers, claims to know how to do everything, but when it comes down to it, he can't do a thing but talk. Well this is America and we all have the right to free speech, but couldn't we all do a book like this? Why does Michael Moore get to have his insane opinions published for his own financial gain? Why don't we all do it? We're all literate, we all have opinions. I'm going to begin my book right now. I'll title it \\"Michael Moore and Other Loud Mouthed Yankees who Need to Shut Up.\\"	2003-09-29

First off, for long time KISS fans, this book has nothing new for you. Everything in this book is the same old Gene we've been reading in Hit Parader for twenty years. It's the same old rehashed cliches and one liners from this holier than thou, better than everybody, egotistical, mediocre bass player.<br />Gene SImmons truly is the American dream. A poor immigrant who conquered the world thirty times over. He and his band KISS were household names in the 70's, reinvented in the 80's, and came back in the 90's. Yes Gene we know, you are so great, you can do no wrong, your word is law, blah, blah, blah.<br />Gene Simmons could put his fave or KISS logo on anything and try to sell it. The man has no reservations of using the KISS banner in any embarrassing way he can to make a buck. Don't believe me? Go ahead and order your KISS Koffin! That's right, a coffin. Women and money may indeed be the God of Thunder's only weaknesses, but who would complain?<br />The worst part of this book is the bashing of his former KISS-mates. We all know Ace is a lazy drunk, but do we need a picture of him kissing a middle aged balding guy in Austrailia?<br />KISS was great, but now they are done. At the Farewell Tour I said goodbye. Now they are a joke.(I mean c'mon, we got a fake Ace now!!!!)  All I have now is fond memories of a great rock band that they once were. I read this book out of curiosity to see if there was anything new, there wasn't. And you won't see me standing in line for KISS cookie cutters, transmission fluid, or lawnmowers.	2003-09-04
US	50940823	R232BOD2KKOIK0	0440215013	469631631	Secrets of a Small Town	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A fascinating, funny, scary read	I remember reading this, some really freaky stuff indeed. Here's the low-down. An author picks an American town and gets a hotel room. He then puts an ad in the paper for people to come to his room and anomynously tell him their dirty secrets. They could not write a letter, they could not call on the phone. To be in the book, they had to come in person and be interviewed.<br />One guy has the strangest of fetishes. He likes to sit in public restrooms and listen to people deficate. Others were stories of childhood escapades, but some were witness to horrifying accounts within their family.<br />Not a very large book, you can easily finish it in an afternoon, but there is at least one story in this book for everyone. It will hit home and stay with you forever.	2003-04-24

Beautiful pictures helped enhance the reading experience. Versailles truly came alive during her early reign.<br />Miss Fraser threw a curve ball by suggesting Louis XVI never had an operation for his sexual 'problem'. Such an operation would have stopped his hunting for at least a week. Louis kept a very accurate hunting journal and there are no date gaps that would have suggested his 'problem' was corrected. So did this king not like Marie Antoinette? He kept no mistresses, so one can only asume he was gay or impotent. I mean c'mon almost seven and a half years of marriage before consumation?<br />The book also describes the so-called 'affair' between Axel and Antoinette. The book never says for sure if there was an affair, but if there was, it was suggested there was intercourse at least once. When the family was being held shortly after their return from the famous and ill-fated escape attempt.<br />Parts of this book seemed rushed. For instance, arguably the most exciting moment of Marie's life was the escape attempt from France. Other books go into much more detail. The September massacres were briefly mentioned except for the killing of Princess de Lambelle. Although I learned in this book that before her head was paraded under the Queen's window, the murderers actually took the head to a beautician's parlor to have her hair done so the Queen would instantly recognize her!<br />The death of Louis XVII was brief, one sentence. There was no mention of his abuse at the hands of the jailors. True this is Marie Antoinette's story, but it is only from her biographies we get any information about her children. The fate of Joseph Louis in the Tower was a tragedy, and we can only be happy the Queen was not alive to know about it.<br />The Queen's trial was covered well, but I've read better. This book is truly a treasure for those most interested in Marie Antoinette's childhood and early reign, that is where the author seemed to put most of her effort. I read new information on the child and 'dauphine' that would become Queen Marie Antoinette.<br />A recommended read.t most of her effort. I read new information on the child and 'dauphine' that would become Queen Marie Antoinette.<br />A recommended read.	2003-03-30

I couldn't help it, when I heard Tim McGraw had a book published I had to laugh, and laugh hard. Yes ol' Timmy's doing pretty good for himself. His CMT sheep will buy whatever they are lead to. Tim doesn't write songs or play an instrument, so I doubt he had anything to do with this book. Much like Gene Simmons, he'll sell himself out with whatever junk producers decide to put his face on. He'll sit back and laugh at how a talentless man became a celebrity in America. Only in America.	2002-12-20

Back then I was a Marilyn Monroe fanatic. Every book, movie, poster, magazine, or collectable I could find, I bought.<br />I must say that I'm still a huge Marilyn fan and have well over 50 books written about her. To this day, Goddess is still the best written, most profound, well meant, and indepth attempt of portraying her story. If you call yourself a Marilyn fan, then there is no question about it. You must read this book.<br />Witnesses, documents, and photos (including her heartbreaking autopsy photo) will add to the text and leave you breathless.	2002-08-28

What can be said about the Crue that hasn't already been said? Apparantly a whole book's worth. For fans of what REAL rock n roll is all about, this is the supreme tale of rock superstardom. Vince is a sex maniac, Nikki is a heroin addict, Mick has a disease that's plagued his entire life, and Tommy, well his heart seems to be in the right place.<br />I agree with Vince, once Nikki (the main songwriter) started heroin, the albums just weren't as good (Theatre of Pain, and Girls, Girls, Girls). Yeah the hits were always there, but there was a whole lot of filler.<br />The main reason I got the book was to learn more about Mick, the Crue's mystery man. You'd be surprised. He named the band, and picked Vince to be the singer. He's done everything (to include hanging his brother). To see what he's done with his life despite his spinal problems and all, well my hat goes off to him.<br />My favorite story? There were so many. But the one I remember most was when Mick passed out on the beach when Razzle died. Mick thought he was dead himself you see. When he went back to the Motley House and saw everyone crying, he thought they were crying for him. He was convinced he was a ghost and tried to walk through the door without opening it!!!<br />Here's to you Mick, Tommy, Nikki, and Vince. Through all your craziness, ups, downs, and adventures (you gotta read about the Ozzy Tour!!!), you put out some of the greatest rock n roll the world knows.	2002-08-18

I ...was very interested. I am a 'fan' of Marie Antoinette and have been fascinated with her life since reading Castelot's biography of her.<br />This book however, though it has some interesting pamphlets of historical interest, is more like a scrapbook. The writing is poor and has no direction. The pamphlets reproduced in the book are mostly pornographic lyrics and droll poetry of the Queen. The worst of which is Marie Antoinette riding an erected penis as if it were an ostrich.<br />If you want to learn about the Queen, her children, or the French Revolution, this is not the book to find it in. If you are very familiar with the Queen's life, this may offer you a little insight as to the people's attitude at the time, but that's it. I read it once, and it has been on the shelf since.<br />For a truly amazing book about Marie Antoinette, I suggest 'The Fatal Friendship'.	2001-07-13

I tried to put myself in the shoes of the photographer when it came to the climatic 'kiss'. Was it enough? Was it too much? Should he, shouldn't he?. It's something only the individual can answer for himself.<br />The only complaint I have about the book are all the x's on the pictures, but that in itself is an interesting story. Before the pictures were to be distributed, Marilyn 'X'ed out the pictures she didn't like directly on the negetive! I would have love to have seen Bert's face when he found out she did this. Oh well, I guess it isn't all bad. Those X's are like an autograph I guess. Also I think these are the only pictures of Marilyn you'll ever see with her scar from gallbladder surgery.	2001-01-25

Fatal Friendship focuses mostly on the friendship between the Queen and Count Axel Fersen, the breathtaking escape attempt and their deaths. Loomis leaves it up to the reader to decide whether or not the two were actual physical lovers, but with the evidence presented, not only do I believe they were, but that Louis XVI knew, and didn't care.<br />The highlight of the book is the escape attempt though. As you read on and on at a harrowing pace, you almost believe they'll make it. But the stupid mistakes, lack of judgement, and time wasted sealed the fate of the royal family.<br />As we all know Marie Antoinette died on the guillotine, but do you know the violent death that Axel Fersen faced? Or the legend of the ring that was given to him by Marie?<br />An excellent, well written, and easy to follow book that made me fall in love with the Queen and see her not as a monster, but as a woman and a mother who despite trying her best, just couldn't make anything work out.	2001-01-24

I read it the first time when I was 16. I'll admit it sent chills down my back and the story itself disturbed me. I fell in love with Cathy,  how she had to care for her two younger siblings, and learn about love,  sex, and devotion from the only person available, her brother. The cruel  grandmother and even crueler mother will make you wonder if there really  are women this evil. If you've only seen the movie, you missed three  quarters of the story. READ THE BOOK!
