You'll find yourself comfortably using some techniques well before you even finish the book.<br />This book impressed me when I first read it 25 years ago. And it has stood the test of time: I felt amazed at how much more useful the techniques seemed when I reread it recently.<br />A couple of points deserve emphasis:<BR>1. In addition to teaching you how to say &quot;no&quot; without feeling guilty, the author masterfully teaches you simple, powerful techniques for keeping your cool while you're under attack.<BR>2. This book plays an important role in the set of cognitive, emotive, and behavioral skills taught by psychologists such as Albert Ellis and David Burns. While books such as &quot;A New Guide to Rational Living&quot; (Ellis) and &quot;The Feeling Good Handbook&quot; (Burns) contain tools that address a far wider range of problems, Smith's methods work far more rapidly, easily, and consistently for the challenges that this book addresses.<br />I strongly recommend this book for anyone wanting to quickly and easily learn to (i) say &quot;no&quot; without feeling guilty and/or (ii) react coolly to attacks by others.	2001-12-27

Some of the parts that I found most interesting include the following:<br />1. What was London really like in the 17th century? (Marrin pulls no punches in describing the sights and odors that more sterile histories omit.<BR>2. The democratic way in which the buccaneers and pirates organized their expeditions. The pirates were a &quot;floating democracy.&quot;<BR>3. The horrific tortures...described vividly in the book...that were &quot;acceptable&quot; more than 300 years ago.<BR>4. How Morgan's life ended.<br />Numerous illustrations accompany the well-documented text. The book far exceeded my expectations, and I will read other books by this author.	2001-12-27

You'll get more details than you'll find anywhere else on the extent to which bin Laden's tentacles reach throughout the world.<BR>3. You'll understand what has primarily fueled bin Laden's wrath for the U.S. (it's NOT the &quot;democratic way of life&quot;) and why people have flocked to bin Laden's cause. <BR>4. While rich in details, the book makes it difficult for the reader to pull together the parts of the story during the reading. After September 11's events, the publisher released the book almost nine months before it's targeted date of completion. Weak editing was an inescapable result.<BR>5. The &quot;afterword&quot; provides a most useful and interesting perspective on story. This is where Berger provides &quot;the big picture.&quot;<br />I've read other books about bin Laden. Despite its editing shortcomings, this is the book to read on the subject.	2001-12-21

Because you will come away with at most four short points that you may record as a reminder for yourself, I recommend checking this one out from your local library. I'm glad I read it; I'm also glad I didn't buy it. It's not a book that you would go back to again and again.	2001-10-24

The goal of the heuristic approach is to study (and use!) the methods and rules of discovery and invention.<br />Here are just some of the questions that Pollya teaches as tools:<br />1. What is the unknown? What is the data? What conditions does the solution need to satisfy?<BR>2. Do you know a related problem? Look at the unknown and try to think of a familiar problem having the same or a similar unknown. <BR>3. Can you restate the problem? Can you solve a part of the problem. <BR>4. Can you think of other data appropriate to determine the unknown? <BR>5. Can you check the result?<BR>6. Can you look back and use the result or the method for some other problem?<br />Overall, the author provides a systematic way to creatively solve problems.

While the underlying elements show remarkable similarity, group and leader dynamics, of course, enter into hate by groups. I do agree with another reviewer who commented that Beck produces few new explanations of hatred and the resulting behaviors. <br />The book, however, easily kept my interest and used many examples to beautifully illustrate the process that Beck explains. And he does provide some direction for helping to combat anger, hostility, and violence.<br />Anyone interested in this book may benefit from the following notes that I made:<br />1. I would like to have seen some information about the duration of the benefits from the cognitive studies that Beck refers to.<BR>2. If you're looking for credible evidence to support a belief (that I would love to have) that we're likely to find ways to significantly prevent or eradicate hate by groups of people, you won't find it in this book.<BR>3. While Beck provides thorough explanations of anger, hostility, and violence, you'll find far more useful tools to combat these patterns in both David Burns' &quot;Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy&quot; (Burns has worked with Beck for more than 15 years) and Albert Ellis' classic &quot;A Guide to Rational Living.&quot;	2001-09-15

While many psychologists and authors focus on one or several &quot;pet techniques,&quot; Ellis and this book show you how to adapt an integrated set of rational (cognitive), emotive, and behavioral tools to your personal situations. And Ellis writes this and many of his other books for us non-psychologists...not just for &quot;professionals.&quot; <br />The book starts by briefly summarizing the results of Ellis' ground-breaking work on what we do that causes us to feel and behave differently than we want. The author then teaches his general cognitive system...which includes very specific instructions...on how to change these feelings, behaviors, and thoughts. Ellis terms this system the &quot;A, B, C, D&quot; method of &quot;disputing&quot; irrational thoughts that are &quot;irrational&quot; because they (i) are not true and (ii) produce results that we don't want. The book then moves beyond this general system and shows you how to easily use cognitive, emotive, and behavioral tools to effectively stop your unwanted patterns. While the methods are extremely user-friendly, they do require work...beyond the reading. <br />Because this book shows how to effectively tackle a wide variety of patterns...the following is a partial list of chapters:<BR>1. Overcoming the influences of your past<BR>2. Refusing to be desperately unhappy<BR>3. Tackling dire needs for approval<BR>4. Eradicating dire fears of failure<BR>5. How to feel undepressed though frustrated<BR>6. Conquering anxiety<BR>7. Acquiring self-discipline<BR>...and others.<br />While many other psychologists/authors, such as David Burns in his &quot;Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy,&quot; use cognitive methods, Ellis shows how to use many of them far more effectively than most others. And he also includes emotive and behavioral tools, many of which he created years ago and that his non-for-profit institute has used successfully for decades. While Burns' book has some excellent additional tools, I strongly suggest that you start with &quot;A Guide for Rational Living&quot; and then move on to Burns' book if you want.<br />I've gone back to this and a few others of Ellis' books several times during the last 10 years or so. After working through a new situation, I keep realizing how much this one volume still does for me. <br />In my opinion, the book's only weakness is its stlye of writing. It's older style is less interesting than that in some of Ellis' newer books. I strongly recommend it not for its literary value, however, but for what it can do for you.	2001-09-06

After first practicing Freudian psychiatry...and finding that it usually (i) didn't work and/or (ii) was far too expensive and time-consuming, Albert Ellis developed rational/cognitive therapy in 1955 and soon added emotive and behavioral tools. Ellis and Burns have played the most important roles in effectively making these tools available to us laymen.<br />These tools work so well that you're far more likely to effectively deal with your own challenges with them than if you went to a psychologist or psychiatrist. (Some people truly do have chemical imbalances or temporarily need medication to get them to where they can deal with their situations, and that, of course, requires seeing a medical doctor.) Studies have consistently proven that cognitive-behavioral techniques help people faster and provide better long-term results than traditional psychiatric therapies. <br />I want to make one point that doesn't appear in most other reviews. Like Ellis, Burns shows you how to use both cognitive and BEHAVIORAL techniques. Yes, most unwanted feelings and behaviors do start with our own thoughts...and we can learn to change them. The main other thing I've learned over the past 20 years or so, however, is that I also need to first take some physical action to help change the emotional/behavioral pattern that I don't want. Just sitting in a chair and thinking differently doesn't do the trick. And &quot;Feeling Good&quot; provides you these tools, too.<br />You can easily benefit from the most powerful tools available through buying and using both Burns' &quot;Feeling Good&quot; and Albert Ellis' &quot;A Guide to Rational Living.&quot; While &quot;Feeling Good&quot; is better written and contains a wider variety of tools, Ellis teaches you how to use the single most effective cognitive system. <br />These tools require you to work in order to realize the benefits that you want. The terrific news is that there is hope! And, just as importantly, you have access to the tools that you need...now.	2001-09-03

The tools in this book that I've found most helpful include (i) instruments to measure both anxiety and depression, (ii) a &quot;pleasure-predicting sheet,&quot; (iii) a daily mood log to help identify and change unwanted feelings, and (iv) tools to help you overcome procrastination.<br />I agree with another reviewer who said that this book and &quot;Feeling Good&quot; overlap to a great extent, and I recommend this one. You don't need to read &quot;Feeling Good&quot; first, and the worksheets in this &quot;Handbook&quot; are larger and easier to copy and work with.<br />While Dr. Burns uses tools from cognitive behavioral therapy, I strongly recommend that you also obtain &quot;A Guide to Rational Living,&quot; by Albert Ellis. Dr. Ellis invented rational (cognitive) behavioral therapy in the mid-1950s and still writes, lectures, and works with clients. While Burns' books are generally better written than Ellis', Dr. Ellis teaches you how to use cognitive techniques more effectively than Dr. Burns does. Instead of just showing you how to recognize faulty thinking that produces unwanted feelings and behaviors and think of alternative thoughts, Dr. Ellis teaches you how to PERSUADE YOURSELF that this faulty thinking is both irrational and counter-productive. In my view, the difference in their approaches is similar to that between an intellectual discussion and a thoroughly persuasive speech. In order to make the desired changes, you need to convincingly and powerfully persuade yourself to change your thinking.<br />Together, this book and &quot;A Guide to Rational Living&quot; give you most all of the tools you need to experience the changes that you want in your feelings and behaviors. The approaches in both books require work. Passively reading them (or anything) will not lead to significant changes. The best news of all is this: There is hope! And you can have the tools at your fingertips.) will not lead to significant changes. The best news of all is this: There is hope! And you can have the tools at your fingertips.	2001-09-03

An investigator primarily uses statement analysis to study a person's choice and organization of words to gain the most information from that person's statement. Statement analysis represents a powerful tool because it goes beyond assessing the statement's content and the interviewee's non-verbal behavior. <br />Don Rabon is a nationally recognized authority on statement analysis. This book provides some excellent information about statement analysis, as well as excerpts from statements that you can analyze to help understand and develop these skills. The appendix provides answers to the exercises that appear throughout the book.<br />I highly recommend that anyone interested in statement analysis, however, begin with the book &quot;In Search of Truth,&quot; by Daniel T. Marsano. It has these advantages over Mr. Rabon's book: It<br />1. presents the concepts and tools in a way that you can understand and work with much more easily;<BR>2. explains why people unconsciously change their language patterns in ways that provide you additional information; <BR>3. teaches you how to use statement analysis in oral interviews, rather than just how to use written or transcribed statements; and <BR>4. shows you how to structure an interview to gain the most information.<br />The only disadvantage to &quot;In Search of Truth&quot; is that you'll need to order it through your book store. If, after reading Mr. Marsano's book, you want to pursue statement analysis further, Mr. Rabon's is one you'll probably want to pick up.	2001-09-02

Books	4	13	16	N	N	Compelling evidence and logic; weak editing	The author does what we expect top-notch detectives to do: He brings together evidence and logic to present a strong case for what actually happened in this 1975 murder case. Not just who murdered 15-year-old Martha Moxley and why, but how the local police bungled a case that they likely could have solved in just a few days or weeks. Instead, 22 years went passed before the author &quot;solved&quot; the case in a way that has finally resulted in trial proceedings against the man that Fuhrman maintains murdered Ms. Moxley.<br />This book does, however, suffer from weakness: poor editing. Some facts keep popping up repeatedly throughout the book without any mention that the reader has already seen them before...several times. A good editor could have organized the information in a way that avoided this annoying pattern.<br />This is the first Furhrman book that I have read.

Most of them, if you're like me. This author understands and effectively communicates some of the keys that bring peace and joy to life. In contrast with some books that offer scores of tips and suggestions that will likely have little impact on our lives, Miguel Ruiz presents his message with clarity and sensitivity. I was skeptical when I opened this book. I really wasn't interested in &quot;Toltec wisdom.&quot; I wasn't interested in &quot;New Age&quot;-sounding theories. What I found in &quot;The Four Agreements&quot; transcends religions and philosophies. I wish I had been open to, received, understood, and acted on this message decades ago. The four agreements encompass a way to live. They are not primarily a subject for intellectual debate. We all know, for example, that it is not possible to literally &quot;make no assumptions&quot; in life. On the other hand, learning to (i) take far fewer things personally and (ii) minimize the assumptions about what I want from relationships with others has helped me tremendously. While my reviews often point out the types of people who probably won't like certain books, I think almost anyone can enjoy, be touched by, and gain greater peace and joy through the help of this book.	2001-08-26

The opening pages provide the most interesting and gripping reading: the trial of the man who murdered Dunne's daughter. I also found the story of the Menendez brothers and that of the murder of Martha Moxley especially interesting. The parts that I found interesting, however, make up only about one-third of the book. Dunne devotes fully one-half of the book to the O.J. story. It goes on and on...and on. When the author noted several time how long and boring the trial became, I was having the same feelings about his treatment of the O.J. saga. I did enjoy learning about Dunne's perceptions of the cast of characters, including defendants, victims' families, attorneys, and reporters. Dunne reports what goes on when the cameras aren't rolling. For the most part, however, the author treats each person as either a &quot;good guy&quot; or a &quot;bad guy.&quot; While I understand that his experiences as the father of a murder victim probably cause this rather simplistic perspective, this and other characteristics of the book resulted in my losing interest about half-way through it. I finished the book but would have enjoyed it more if I'd read the first 80 pages and the final 20 pages.	2001-08-25

This book helps put life in a healthy perspective. Actually, I picked up this book while I was in the midst of reading &quot;The Survivor Personality.&quot; While the latter book is good, &quot;It's Not About the Bike&quot; masterfully shows what it's like to be not only a survivor...but a thriver. It helped me change my attitude about some challenges that really amounted to nothing more than &quot;mole hills.&quot; The book tells more about what it has taken for Armstrong to succeed than some reviews have indicated. Yes, he has natural physiological advantages. But so do all professional athletes. Lance does not have physiological advantages over all of his competitors. The book shows that he has learned to plan, execute his plan...and work his butt off. Does this mean that Armstong has the personality that many people wish he had? No. And the rest of us have personality flaws, too. I much prefer to read about people--especially sports stars and other celebrities--as they are, not as we would like to idealize them. This makes the book's message (about what it takes to become a survivor) much more relevant to me. Most everyone will love this book. You don't have to be a bicycle rider or sports fan. Riding with Armstong down Alps road on a bike at 70 miles per hour...with only a few feet of visibility...moves you into a differernt world. Readers who are offended by occasional expletives are the only ones who should steer clear of this terrific book.	2001-08-24

I strongly encourage you to read this after reading both &quot;The Brotherhood of the Rose&quot; and &quot;The Fraternity of the Stone.&quot; (Both of those rank among my all-time favorites.) <br />Besides bringing together the two protagonists from those books, the author (for the most part) continues blending action with logic in a way that made the first two books so much better than run-of-the-mill action/mystery novels. &quot;The League of Night and Fog&quot; begins with four different plots that gradually meld together.<br />One reviewer indicated that this book him feeling a little flat. I had the same experience; the ending just didn't have the same quality that I found in the rest of the book. OK, so it's not &quot;the perfect book.&quot; Few are. Most readers who like this genre will enjoy this book.	2001-07-28

That's the reader's choice. After making the choice to live with such a person, however, the reader will find strategies in this book to make that living situation as workable as possible. Nothing will make it easy; the book does provide effective tools that require discipline and practice.<br />These strategies, by the way, work well with non-family neurotics, such as co-workers and supervisors. The book focuses on how to live with behavior in others that we do not have the power to change. Sometimes, we can find no better option.	2001-07-28

This small volume packs substance. Situational management was not a fad. As recently as 1999, Peter Drucker (in his book &quot;Management Challengers for the 21st Century&quot;) emphasized that despite the apparent hunger for learning &quot;the one best way to manage, one such method does not exist.&quot; Producing desirable results is the goal of management; how to manage varies tremendously according to differences in situations.<br />This book goes well beyond espousing the idea of &quot;different strokes for different folks.&quot; Becoming a situational leader involves:<br />1. Starting with goals that are clear to both the manager and the people who will help accomplish them.<br />2. Working with her people to diagnose their &quot;competence&quot; and &quot;commitment&quot; to accomplish those goals. Diagnosis preceds effective management methods.<br />3. Contracting with each person on each of the tasks and jointly deciding which leadership style will likely be most effective. <br />4. Following through to provide the agreed-upon leadership style until either (i) enough progress or (ii) lack of suitable progress warrants a change in leadership style.<br />The book presents a practical model for diagnosing each person's level of development with regard to achieving each major goal. <br />One other note: Despite its &quot;leadership&quot; title, the book addresses one-on-one supervision methods. If you're looking for a book that addresses how to create and sustain a &quot;vision&quot; that will drive your organization forward, this is not that book. It is, however, the most practical presentation of situational management that I've read.	2001-07-28

At the conclusion of his book &quot;A Twist at the End,&quot; Steven Saylor highly recommends this biography of O. Henry. I do, too. <br />This book sheds so much light on both William Sydney Porter (O. Henry) and American life in the late 19th century and early 20th century. O'Connor meticulously documents his sources in a way that never interferes with his story. About three-fourths of the way through the book, I suddenly realized that this non-fiction work is far more interesting than the novel (&quot;A Twist at the End&quot;) that Saylor wrote about one part of O. Henry's life.<br />If you enjoy biographies, try to find a used copy of this book.	2001-07-27

Every part of the book kept me turning the pages. I liked the entertaining blend of action and thinking. With rare exceptions, the plot stayed a step ahead of where I expected it to go.<br />I found Shelby's name through Amazon.com. I like many of David Morrell's books, and Amazon &quot;suggested&quot; that I would probably like Shelby. &quot;Days of Drums&quot; does contain a number of bloody scenes with graphic descriptions. Readers averse to such scenes might want to choose a different book. This characteristic, however, does not dominate the book. Compared with Thomas Harris' books, such as &quot;Red Dragon,&quot; this book is mild in this respect.	2001-07-22

The plot begins with an interesting twist and then moves along quickly. Morrell has certainly developed the knack for ending a chapter with a sentence that almost forces you to start the next chapter. <br />While &quot;Desperate Measures&quot; doesn't develop the psychological depth or plot as some of his earlier books did, it does entertain.	2001-07-16

This is not one of them. <br />At his best, Morrell blends action with psychology. I keep turning the pages to see not just what happens, but why the protaganist does what he does. To understand the character and how he thinks. Morrell has mastered this genre.<br />I felt very disappointed with &quot;Burnt Sienna.&quot; The plot and characters have little depth. The book offers non-stop action and is a quick read. I kept thinking that Morrell probably wrote the book almost as quickly as the reader flips its pages. With about 25 pages left (and before the plot resolved), I thought seriously about not even taking the time to finish it.<br />This book reminded me so much of the ones Sidney Sheldon has cranked out for many years. If you like Sheldon's books of the past 10 years or more, you will enjoy &quot;Burn Sienna.&quot; If you don't like those Sheldon books, you may not want to even check it out of the library.	2001-07-15

It defines legal terms in such a clear and concise way that I don't need legal dictionaries designed for the &quot;layman.&quot; Whenever I want to understand a new legal term, I pick up this book and acquire a basic understanding within just a minute or so.<br />Most attorneys already have familiarity with this book.

The book covers Austin's story from its inception in the late 1830s to the mid-1980s. Overall, I learned how Austin evolved into the city it now is.<br />Having just read Steven Saylor's &quot;A Twist at the End&quot; and visited the O. Henry Museum, I was most interested in Austin's history during the last two decades of the 19th century. Readers wanting to know more about other parts of the city's history will find that the text and graphical content puts each stage of Austin's development into a useful perspective.<br />I learned...and thoroughly enjoyed the process.	2001-07-15

As a professional who needs to understand legal terminology, however, I have found this book unnecessary. I bought &quot;Law Dictionary for Nonlawyers&quot; before I acquired &quot;Black's Law Dictionary.&quot; The latter is so complete and has such clear definitions that I rarely even bother to use &quot;Law Dictionary for Nonlawyers.&quot; <br />I strongly recommend that the layman buy and use &quot;Black's Law Dictionary,&quot; rather than this or other legal dictionaries designed for laypersons.	2001-07-15

Back in 1959, when the male gender dominated the economics discipline, Ms. Penrose set out to answer this question: Was there &quot;something inherent in the very nature of any firm that both promoted its growth and necessarily limited its RATE of growth.&quot;<br />I found this book so interesting and helpful (I am a business appraiser) that I read it twice. This led me into studying the resource-based view of the firm.<br />I recommend this book for anyone interested in the broad topics of business strategy and management. Related books that I recommend include &quot;Contemporary Strategy Analysis,&quot; by Robert Grant; &quot;Modern Competitive Analysis, by Sharon Oster; and &quot;Why Firms Succeed,&quot; by John Kay.	2001-07-15

MacNeal makes a strong case that a proper understanding of mathematics requires thinking skills that our schools have not yet even identified. The author fills this book with examples of basic mistakes that &quot;educated&quot; people often make when using or even talking about numbers. <br />MacNeal argues convincingly that using mathematics properly goes far beyond being able to manipulate numbers. Mathematics is a language that helps us understand the real world. Divorcing this language from spoken languages, such as English, fails to teach students how to use and think about issues that relate to mathematics. (And that certainly includes a multitude of topics!)<br />&quot;Mathsemantics&quot; also provides a practical method of learning to make estimates. The author provides many examples of how to use information that we do have to make reasonable estimates regarding information that is unavaialable to us.<br />If I were a high school or college instructor...of almost any subject...I would (easily) find a way to make &quot;Mathsemantics&quot; required, relevant reading. This book provides so much more value than most of the &quot;best-selling&quot; books that you will read and hear about.	2001-07-15

I will take that advice and disagree with the positive reviews I have read.<br />This book lacks the focus necessary to impact most readers' lives in a significant way. If you benefit from books that contain scores of miscellaneous suggestions and tips, you might be the exception. After finishing the book, however, I felt as if I had read through a stack of one and two-page articles from Reader's Digest. Many of the tidbits were interesting. Taken together they provided little that I will remember or use. <br />Based on the very positive reviews I had read, I expected much more substance.	2001-07-13

The plot focuses on Austin's serial murders of the 1880s. These serial murders preceded those of &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; and were among the first such murders in history.<br />If you look for books that keep you riveted to each page, this book will disappoint you. Steven Saylor's writing was so uneven that at least 200 pages failed to hold my interest. If I had not been interested in Austin's history, I would not have finished the book. And I would have rated it lower--either two or three stars.<br />Since I live in Austin and want to understand more about its history, I found this book worthwhile.	2001-07-11

Wouldn't we all like to &quot;understand people&quot; and &quot;predict their behavior--Anytime, Anyplace&quot;?  Sure, but you won't find the answer here.<br />The message of the book is to  &quot;pay attention&quot; and evaluate all clues in the context of the  other factors.  When it came to specifics, the book includes list after  list of things to look and listen for...and keeps saying that those factors  may or may not tell you the real story.  <br />I love listening to interviews  with Dimitrius.  She knows her craft.  But this book utterly fails to  deliver on the promise (as embodied in the title).  Don't waste your money  on this one.
