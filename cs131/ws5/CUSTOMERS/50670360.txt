Although Crier seemingly comes across as a bit of an alarmist at times one cannot deny that she has researched the topic well and provided abundant source material.  <br /> <br />What I find particularly noteworthy about \\"Contempt\\" is how Crier artfully points out the judicial activism that takes place on the far right, and how the term \\"judicial activism\\" has been co-opted by social conservatives to serve as a codeword for any sort of court decision that challenges their attempt to turn America into a religious theocracy.    <br /> <br />As is the case anytime a book like this is published there will be the usual band of ignorant wingnuts (like Timothy Cornwell) slagging this book and questioning the credentials of the author.  The intelligent, objective observer would do well to avoid paying attention to such blather.  Crier is not a liberal; she's a moderate Republican with libertarian leanings.  She is also a former attorney and judge so I think it's far to say that she has a pretty good idea of what she's talking about. <br /> <br />If you are sincerely concerned about the tone this country has taken under George W. Bush, the religious charlatans who have effectively taken control of the Republican Party, and the hypocritical, corrupt politicians who do their bidding then this book is for you.	2005-09-15

Civilized political discourse, rather than blind adherence to political extremism, is the very essence of what America is all about.  Just read the uninformed, ignorant comments by B.C. Hackman in his review if you want proof of how bad things have really gotten in this age of spin groups and Swift Boat Liars.  Michael Moore and Al Franken are included in Goldberg's list, but it should be noted that these people represent the political left's reaction to the individuals that Goldberg conveniently neglected to list, thereby leading to the conclusion that this latest work is just another hackneyed screed written for the same right wing audience that has bought his other books. <br /> <br />I'm surprised Goldberg didn't want to title this book \\"The New Mein Kampf\\".  It seems to be going in about the same direction as the original.	2005-07-31

First, author John O'Neill was a vocal critic of John Kerry when the latter joined an antiwar Vietnam Veteran's group and started speaking out against the war.  O'Neill's criticisms were refuted and he was quickly forgotten, but now some 30 years later he crawls out from under his rock to pen an embittered, vicious screed that is based primarily on interviews with individuals who served in Vietnam during the same time as Kerry, but NOT on the same boat.  Given O'Neill's obvious bitterness and jealousy over Kerry's success, as well as the highly suspicious timing of publication of this book in the midst of one of this country's most divisive presidential campaigns (and spearheaded by a family friend of Kerry's opponent), only a blind partisan or a fool would have the temerity to call this book accurate or to believe the ludicrous claims made therein.  Calling this reprehensible book exploitive would be too kind, libellous would be more accurate.  Those who dare to call John Kerry a traitor would do well to examine the motives and credibility of the author of this outrageous work of fiction.  I wonder if O'Neill is angling for a job with The American Spectator after the election?	2004-10-11

That said, I don't think that The Last Juror was as bad as some of the other customer reviewers have made it out to be.  I was actually quite excited at the prospect of another of Grisham's stories set in Clanton, Mississippi, the same town in which the best book he's ever written-A Time to Kill-is set.<br />In The Last Juror, Grisham has done his usual fine job in developing interesting, colorful characters and in describing the town and its environs.  It's very evident that he's familiar with the local color and has done a good job of capturing the look and feel of a small southern town from the early 70s struggling with with everything from racial prejudice and desegregation to corruption to the blight created when a national superstore chain comes to town.  I also found the plot to be very interesting albeit somewhat derivative: a member of a very powerful but reclusive family is tried for and convicted of the rape and murder of a young widow.   In prison, he receives preferential treatment and gains early parole.  Shortly after his release some members of the jury that convicted him are killed.  The story is told from the point of view of a college dropout who owns and operates the town's weekly newspaper.  Parenthetically, I understand that Grisham did not want to title the book as it was but caved in to pressure from his publisher.  After reading the book, I now uderstand why-the title is somewhat of a misnomer.  There is no LAST juror, so just put this issue aside and enjoy the book.<br />Other reviewers have criticized Grisham's writing in this book and I must concede that on some level they're right.  The book is divided into three sections, the first of which is as well written as any of Grisham's earlier work.  The writing in the second and third parts, however, seem to suggest that Grisham started losing interest in his subject and was just going through the motions.  I can't remember any Grisham novel in recent memory that contained so many short chapters.  That's too bad, because this book really started out with some promise.  After the first few chapters I was raving to my wife that this might be Grisham's best book yet but by the end I realized it was not to be.<br />Overall, I'd rate the Last Juror as a much better novel than some of his more recent efforts like the Testament and The King of Torts, but not quite as good as The Summons or A Time to Kill.  While I that Grisham revisits Clanton in subsequent books, I also hope that he puts a little more effort into those visits.  But then again, maybe my expectations were too high.	2004-02-26

The problem I have with The Automatic Millionaire is that it is essentially a collection of tips that I've heard on a number of financial planning shows over the years.  Unless you've been living under a rock and not paying attention to any of the many financial planning programs on TV and radio these past several years the fact is you simply don't need this book.  The core message of the book is that you can become an automatic millionaire if you essentially live like a miser.  That's not a startling revelation now, is it?  I imagine Bach has himself become a millionaire from sales of this and his past books and I'm sure that if you follow the principles in The Automatic Millionaire you might actually become a millionaire.  The question is whether you'll live long enough to enjoy the results of your efforts.  Save your money and watch more CNN/FN instead.	2004-02-07

Some rather ignorantly and cynically criticize it as a tome of self-aggrandizement by a still aspiring politician.  Others, particularly political conservatives, gleefully lambaste Kerrey with hateful diatribes based on his politics rather than on anything of substance or fact.  Still others think he owes them some sort of explanation about his role in Vietnam.  They are, as one previous reviewer of this book stated, \\"unpardonably arrogant.\\"<br />\\"When I Was a Young Man\\" represents Kerrey's attempt to exorcise some of the demons that have haunted him since his days as a young man.  He looks wistfully at his childhood and college years in Lincoln, Nebraska, and goes on to tell about his career as a Navy SEAL and his deployment to Vietnam, where he lost a leg and was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.  As most of us also know, he was also involved in a most unfortunate mission that resulted in a number of innocent civilians being killed.  Kerrey clearly doesn't dwell on the subject for reasons best known to him, but to his critics I would say that he doesn't owe you an explanation.  Further, unless you were there and faced what he did you have no right to criticize.  This book represents Kerrey's attempt to deal with the horrors of war in the best way he knows how.  I found it to be an interesting read well worth my time.  But if you want startling revelations about what is best characterized as a tragic incident that unfortunately occurs in armed conflicts, you'd best look elsewhere.	2002-09-02

Unlike Rush Limbaugh, Savage doesn't screen his calls.  However, he frequently berates and insults callers.  More simply put, Savage is to radio what Morton Downey Jr. was to TV not that many years ago.<br />&quot;Compassionate Conservative Speaks&quot; is really nothing more than a series of conclusory statements, thinly veiled insults, and inane theories in support of the author's ultra conservative viewpoints.  Don't look for critical analysis here, as you won't find it.  <br />Each side of the political spectrum has its share of loudmouthed fringe element whackos who can't see the fallacy of their own arguments.  The left has Ralph Nader and the right has Pat Buchanan.  Savage's extremism and paranoia is even farther to the right of Buchanan's.

There's no doubt that the profession could and should do more for those who are less fortunate, and I think this book does a good job of putting that into perspective, although it is just a bit preachy.  Aside from a somewhat incredible part about a homeless man holding the members of a law firm hostage, it is a believable and forthright look into the world of poverty law and pro-bono work.<br />What I find particularly bothersome and somewhat offensive were the somewhat politically charged opinions of some other readers that this book was a springboard for the author's political views (of which Grisham doesn't appear to have made his readers aware), or that it is written with a &quot;liberal&quot; viewpoint.  It's unfair and rather ignorant to refer to anything that attempts to raise social consciousness as &quot;liberal&quot;.  This is yet another example of how the dreaded &quot;L&quot; word gets overused these days by self-absorbed, ignorant people who disagree with anything that brings attention to the social problems of this country that they'd prefer we didn't talk about because it reflects their own selfishness and greed.  <br />Read the book with your political filter (of whatever persuasion) turned off and enjoy it for what it is.	2002-01-28

Sadly, it lacks any semblance of credibility after that.  I have read every known account of the facts and circumstances surrounding the Lincoln assasination and have presented many talks on this subject.  In my opinion, Balsiger's book ranks with Louis Weichmann's as one of the worst and most unreliable volumes on the subject.<br />Factual information is either ignored, misinterpreted, or given short shrift.  The &quot;conspiracy&quot; to the degree one existed was between John Wilkes Booth, Lewis Paine, George Atzerodt, and David Herold (and to a lesser degree, Michael O'Laughlin, John Surratt, and Samuel Arnold).  ... Balsiger's book does little more than make sensational claims that the author cannot support without discrediting, reinventing, or ignoring historical fact.	2001-04-23

Weichmann would be little more than a footnote in the story of the assasination of Abraham Lincoln had he not shown himself to be ...individuals associated with a second, almost darker tragedy...the execution of an innocent woman.<br />Weichmann rented a room in the boarding house of widow Mary Surratt, where many of those who conspired to kidnap and later assasinate Lincoln lived at the time.  Once the conspiracy was uncovered, overzealous federal officials alleged Mrs. Surratt was an active participant.  Historical fact, as well as the testimony of the conspirators themselves, stood in sharp contradiction to these allegations.  Weichmann, who was barely acquainted with any of these individuals, testified that she was an active participant.  It was later determined that his motive was to curry favor with government officials in hopes of obtaining a federal job.  Based on Weichmann's false testimony, an innocent woman went to the gallows.  Weichmann later wrote this book in attempt to cash in on the public's thirst for knowledge.  The problem is, he had none.  He just happened to be in the same place as some of the conspirators for a brief period of time.<br />It is with this knowledge of the author's motives that anyone considering reading this book should approach it.  Weichmann has earned his place in American history as a liar and a coward.  As an author, he is not worthy of belief.	2001-04-23

This is not a pretty world in which we live, and to suggest that filmmakers should sugarcoat movies to present only sweetness and light is patently absurd.  But this is exactly what Medved seems to be striving for.  He has become a darling of the conservative right but in the process discarded semblance of credibility and integrity he may have had as an objective film reviewer.

Although this  title is out of print, I strongly recommend finding and reading it to find  the truth behind what amounts to little more than blatant manipulation of  the appointment process (I will admit to having some bias in writing this  review, by the way).	2000-07-28

After reading it I can only conclude that the author seems to be suffering from some serious unresolved conflicts.<br />McKinnon represents  a radical, and in my opinion, unacceptable view of feminism.  There are  better authors in this field such as Steinem, who presents a more balanced  and substantially less radical viewpoint.  McKinnon is to feminism as Louis  Farrakhan is to Afro culture.	2000-03-21

Cray has done an admirable job of chronicalling the life and times of one of the most influential and misunderstood men of the 20th Century.<br />The book portrays Warren initially as an ambitious politician with  uncompromising moral values during the early part of his career and life as  Alameda County District Attorney, California Attorney General, and  California Governor (hardly the political hack that a previous reviewer  described).  <br />Appointed as Chief Justice of the United States in 1953,  &quot;Chief Justice&quot; describes in intricate detail the decision-making  process that went into the most far-reaching and criticized court decisions  in the history of the Supreme Court, including &quot;Brown v. Board of  Education&quot;, &quot;Mapp v. Ohio&quot;, and &quot;Miranda v.  Arizona&quot;.  Cray does a first rate job of showing the reader the  conflict Warren had in reconciling a fair result to his pre-appointment  philosophies of the law.  <br />Cray has done a first rate job with this book  in portraying one of this country's most influential and enigmatic persons.   Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.  As an attorney, I've  always had great respect for the landmark decisions of the Supreme Court  under Warren, and I recommend this novel to anyone who has ever criticized  &quot;judicial activism&quot;.  After reading &quot;Chief Justice&quot;, as  well as &quot;The Bretheren&quot;, I have come to realize just how thankful  we as a society should be for Warren's service on the Court.  No matter how  hard his less enlightened successors (Burger; Rehnquist) have tried to roll  back the import of the major decisions of the Warren-led Supreme Court,  those decisions will hopefully always stand the test of time.	2000-03-18
US	50670360	R35Y95A6UGTMHV	0688086683	988869300	The Supreme Court: How It Was, How It Is	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Very Informative and Well Written	When I first read this book, I prepared myself for somewhat of a conservative slant, given the tone of many of Rehnquist's decisions since he was appointed to the Court in 1971.  However, and quite surprisingly, this book is well-written and does not attempt to present a conservative  view of the Supreme Court.  As the previous customer reviewer noted, this  is an excellent book for the layperson who wants to understand how the  Court functions.  As an attorney, I find it concise and written so as to  explain the inner workings of the Court without trying to be patronizing or  condescending.  I'm highly impressed!	2000-03-14

The guide is of absolutely no worth in determining the relative artistic merit of any motion picture  because Maltin has shown throughout the years that he wouldn't know a good  movie if it slapped him upside the head.  Furthermore, he tends to show a  rather strong bias for artsy movies, particularly foreign films.  At least  other critics like Shalit, Ebert, and Reed are a little more objective and  even-handed in their reviews.  If being a critic means being at odds with  the movie-going public 90% of the time, then Leonard Maltin's your  reviewer.  I put him right down there with Michael Medved as being a hack  masquerading as a movie critic.<br />More simply put, there are better movie  guides out there than Maltin's.  Haliwell's, for example, is a lot more  objective and a better buy for the money.	2000-03-12
US	50670360	R2E1ZVK2MLEK4C	0385497466	376574359	The Brethren	Books	3	0	0	N	N	A Good Book-But Grisham's Written Better Ones	For me, John Grisham's books fall into two categories:  excellent and mediocre.  Unfortunately, &quot;The Bretheren&quot; falls into the latter of these categories.<br />The plot of the book is simple enough:  three  disgraced and imprisoned jurists run a gay correspondence scam (or  &quot;The Angola Scam&quot; as referred to in the book) from behind prison  walls and unwittingly ensnare a presidential contender handpicked by the  Director of the CIA and supported by a cabal of defense contractors.   <br />&quot;The Bretheren&quot; is eerily ominous in showing how a  presidential election can be bought (the party of the candidate is never  really stated, but there are subtle hints he's a member of the GOP), and  the timing may or may not be coincidental. <br />This book tries to be as  ambitious as &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot; in portraying the author's  perception of contemporary politics; unfortunately, it falls far short of  that novel because it doesn't portray the suspense and paranoia that made  &quot;Pelican&quot; such a good read (despite the disappointing transition  to the silver screen).  The ending was also flat and contained none of the  panache of earlier and better works such as &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;,  &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;, and &quot;The Street Lawyer&quot;.  Despite this  flaw the character development, long a strong point of Grisham's writing,  is as good as always.<br />Overall, I'd have to put &quot;The Bretheren&quot;  with &quot;The Chamber&quot; and &quot;The Partner&quot; as Grisham's  &quot;also-ran&quot; or &quot;b list&quot; works.  This book could've been  a contender.  Unfortunately, it runs out of steam too quickly and the  ending disappoints.	2000-02-21
