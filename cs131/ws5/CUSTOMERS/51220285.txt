The 6th edition (ISBN 0-7216-6278-10) came out in 1997. I'm a medical librarian and I keep this next to my computer desk to aid in spelling for online searches, looking up  unfamiliar words so I know which book(s) to check, and to help me translate  medical jargon into laymen's terms for patients.  My library has Dorland's  and Stedman's medical dictionaries, too, of course, but this one is my  personal favorite.	1999-08-03

This book kept me up until my eyes refused to stay open any  longer and I made sure to finish it during breakfast, even though it meant  I had to scramble to get to work.    The references to other mystery books  and authors were fun when I recognized them and gave me some idea what the  other fictional detectives were like when I didn't.    The reason for Edith  Wentworth's non-stop lifestyle came as no surprise when it was revealed,  because it's similar to one of Leslie Ford's classic Grace Latham-Colonel  Primrose mysteries.  (Given the the emphasis Patricia Wentworth of Miss  Silver fame placed on honorable conduct, the choice of surname for Jonathan  and Edith was quite appropriate.)     General (Retired) Bud Hatch raised my  hackles from his first appearance.  I didn't care how many men (including  Max)thought he could be a great/good guy.  As the book progressed, I knew  he wasn't.  I'm a DAC(Department of the Army Civilian), as was my mother.   I received my certificate and pin for 20 years' service last year.  My  father was Air Force, so I'm a former military brat, too.  I can assure the  reader who is unfamiliar with our military that Hatch is no caricature.  I  find the premise of the Dark Deed that led to the General's death  chillingly plausible.  Even though I cannot condone Hatch's murder, I  understand why his killer shot him.    Got a good chuckle out of the way  that our modern gallant women of South Carolina foiled Hatch's plot to make  sure that the Fourth of July festival honored only patriotic men.  It was  also satisfying that Hatch was the disgrace to his former uniform, not the  gay Vietnam veteran that Hatch thought shouldn't be allowed to wear a  uniform.    Max Darling actually stirred himself quite a bit in this book,  which was a pleasant surprise.  On the other hand, if his mother, Laurel,  hadn't been so kind to Gail Oldham, it would have been prudent for Max and  Annie to have locked her in a bedroom with a bath until the murder was  solved.   Laurel is a woman who scarcely comprehends the meaning of  moderation.    A welcome departure from old mysteries is the depiction of  minorities and &quot;just plain folks&quot;  as intelligent, honest, and  capable.    Loved Annie's &quot;speak your mind&quot; thoughts that she was  so wise to leave unspoken.  I also loved the depictions of Dorothy L. and  Agatha, Annie's cats.  Yes, indeedy, Ms. Hart knows cats.  (It's a good  thing those cats are fictional, or our cover designer and illustrators  might find themselves on the business end of Agatha's claws for putting her  at the bottom and Dorothy L at the top.  By the way, that's a delightful  grin on the face of the alligator that forms the &quot;D&quot; in  &quot;Dead&quot;.  At least I think it's meant to be an alligator, although  the snout seems more like a crocodile's.)    In short, this update of an  old kind of murder mystery is as welcome as a glass of lemonade or ice tea  on a hot day.  Ann E. Nichols	1999-07-13

I don't know much about country music even though my late father was an Oakie from Okmulgee and descended from a long line of sons and daughters of the Old South.  My  siblings and I were not exposed to Country Western except for once a week  when our mother avoided the family room while the rest of us watched  &quot;Hee Haw&quot; [salute!].  My ignorance didn't matter a bit.   The  book is hilarious!  I didn't mind Patsy Angel. (I've never quite understood  why someone who was born at the same time that someone died would become  the reincarnation of the dead person when the baby was around months before  birth.  I forget why belief in reincarnation was dropped from Christian  doctrine, but I'm sure that wasn't the reason.)  I laughed uproariously as  the plot became more complicated.  I loved the final chapter so much I  reread it several times.  The next day I was quoting the opening lines of  the title song's chorus to my coworkers.  I even ordered a copy to be sent  to my sister.  I'm sure she's going to love it.  Ann E. Nichols	1999-06-29

I think men would rate it more highly than I have.  It wasn't too easy, the narrator is a manly young man, and the eccentric amateur sleuth both amusing and shrewd.  There is only one  reason I do not recommend it for women.  It's obvious to a modern female  reader that the amateur sleuth completely misread the female suspect's  feelings toward the morally and physically repugnant murder victim.  I  didn't see it coming and my outrage spoiled the book for me.  A woman  forwarned might be able to just grit her teeth and consider the period in  which the book was written.   Ann E.

US	51220285	R1SL6DNRKSP0KT	0553298755	825668119	Black Ribbon	Books	3	7	12	N	N	I wish Ms.  Conant Would Get This Bee Out of Her Bonnet	Last year I read copy of *Ruffly Speaking* that had been given to me.  Then I bought every paperback of Ms. Conant's series that was available in my town, which brought me up to *Black Ribbon*.  As I read each book in  order, my pleasure grew.  I thought Ms. Conant well deserved to have her  books come out in hardcover and have better cover designs.  The main  characters were engaging.  It was even a &quot;fat-friendly&quot; series  for a fat reader (5' 1/2&quot;, 214 pounds) because one of the heroine's  friends was a nice, competent, chubby policeman who was putting on a few  more pounds almost every book. That was refreshing.  It's difficult to find  positive fat characters in fiction.  Most authors seem to have no qualms  about making nasty remarks about their fat characters or fat people in  general.  (Unless the fat character is a nice person, in which case  euphemisms for &quot;fat&quot; are used.) Apparently, authors don't care  that a fat reader might find these remarks hurtful or offensive.  It's no  different from when books routinely had derogatory portrayals of ethnic or  racial minorities in them.  It's as if our extra fat means we have no right  to be treated with courtesy, decency, and respect.    Up until  *Bloodlines*, Ms. Conant's series was delightful.  I don't know what  happened to the author, but she changed.  Suddenly, fat was disgusting, if  not evil.  This was a shock.  I reread *Ruffly Speaking*.  As I recall,  Holly's friend stopped being chubby without any explanation.  However,  aside from a nasty description of a very fat female spectator at a dog  show, there was nothing offensive.  So I went ahead and read *Black  Ribbon*.    Ms. Conant now seems to actually hate fat people.  In this new  version of Holly Winter's world, if you're fat, you can't be nice.  I  really liked this series, but I can't be comfortable reading a book where I  get the impression the author would despise me because of my weight.  I  hope Ms. Conant will once again realize that fat people aren't necessarily  nasty or evil just because we're fat.    If you don't mind negative  portrayals of fat people, you should have no problem enjoying this book.   If not for that, I would have enjoyed it.      Ann E. Nichols	1999-06-28

I enjoyed the period details and the relationships among the characters.  The glimpses we get of court life follow what we learn about royalty and their courts from history  rather than fairy tales.  They didn't live &quot;happily ever after.&quot;   After reading what our young pharaoh and Lord Meren, his &quot;eyes and  ears&quot; have to put up with, the sensible reader will give thanks for  being a nobody.      Even though I knew that people didn't live as long  back then, it still seemed a bit strange to have Lord Meren, soon to be a  grandfather, consider himself as getting up there in years when he's only  34.  Meren's son, Kysen, has been a father for several years at an age  where young American men today would just be turning old enough to vote.     The only quarrel I have with this series is the portrayal of Queen  Ankhesenamen.  I first &quot;met&quot; her as a very sympathetic character  in Morrison's *The Lost Queen of Egypt*, so the harsh portrait of her that  Robinson draws is difficult for me to swallow.  However, neither that nor  knowing that Lord Meren must lose his beloved Pharaoh at a young age,  prevented me from reading the other books.  This is one of the authors for  whom I am unwilling to wait for the paperback.  Even now I can hardly wait  for the next book.  Ann E. Nichols	1999-06-08

I've managed to obtain used  copies of the first three, but I'm still looking for this one.  Those  readers who, like myself, have not seen a copy in years, might wish to see  a copy of The Murder of Tutankhamen:  a True Story by Bob Brier.  I can't  speak for the paperback version because I own the hardcover, but the  hardcover reproduces the same  portrait of Ankhesenamen that was in The  Lost Queen of Egypt.  Until then I'd had only a pale photocopy I'd made  over 20 years ago.  Other fans of this book may understand how I felt as if  I'd found an old friend when I saw that painting in color again.  It was as  lovely as ever.  I wish J.B. Lippincott Company would reprint the book.   Ann E. Nichols	1999-06-07

Fair warning:  if you're expecting this to be a nice &quot;cozy&quot; where everything comes out right in the end, you're going to have to be satisfied  with partial justice.  There are two mysteries in this one, the minor one  that's ridiculously easy to solve, and the major one that's quite a bit  harder.  The debates between characters with different viewpoints are  interesting, as usual.       Long-time readers can tell that the  rehabilitation of Miranda, who was rather obnoxious in the first book, is  complete -- the handy cast listing has dropped that line that she thumps  her own Bible.  (Of course, it was easy to tell that the authors decided  they really liked her when they started to describe her as plump instead of  fat.  The Browns follow a modern trend in writing where nice fat characters  are described using euphemisms for fat.  The dreaded three-letter word is  reserved for fat characters who aren't nice.)      Those readers who  consider Fair a jerk, as I do, will be pleased that he hardly shows up.  I  wish the authors would introduce a man worthy of Harry.        Notes:  The  illustrations are usually accurate as well as attractive, so it's  surprising that Pewter is in the dam-crossing one when the text states that  she stayed home.  Was there a change to the original draft?      The  publisher might wish to look at the fourth paragraph from the bottom on  p.30.  Unless &quot;scared cow&quot; is Virginian for &quot;sacred  cow&quot;, they might wish to correct that for the paperback.<br />Ann E.  Nichols	1999-06-01

The Mrs. Jeffries series, in spite of details and expressions sprinkled in, has never reminded me of the Real Thing.  I don't care.  I like this series anyway.   The tone reminds me of Miss Seeton.  You aren't getting Anne Perry here,  although Ms. Brightwell does have some good comments about social ills.<br />   These books are dainty tea cakes that make for a nice afternoon or  evening's read.  Sometimes that's all you want; and if that IS all you  want, this would be a good series to buy.  The main characters are  sympathetic (although Lutie is a little too much) and the murders aren't  ridiculously easy to solve.  This particular entry has a few decent red  herrings (all right, I'll admit it -- the author had me fooled too long for  my comfort).  <br />  The covers fit the series well except for one thing:   why is Mrs. Jeffries always portrayed with completely grey hair when the  books state that her hair has some grey in it?  (I think her hair is  auburn, but this isn't my computer, so I can't check.)  I know it's a minor  thing, but the artist is otherwise so close that it's a shame to have that  mistake.  I've suffered the aggravation of buying books with covers that  have nothing to do with the interior so I do appreciate the fact that this  artist has put some effort into the assignment.<br />   In short, if you like  cozies, you should try Mrs. Jeffries out.  You'll probably want to get them  all.  Ann E. Nichols	1999-05-28

The author's skill with descriptions was enough to make me share the heroine's emotions (after listening to all those salmon  pushers -- and thank goodness we have only a hint of their burblings -- I'd  be wanting to sink my teeth into some beef, too).  Beck does as good job  with the minor characters as with the main.  I admire the way the obnoxious  or boring characters were brought to sufficient life that I wanted to sneak  away from them.  The comments about Americans who try to force their own  views on the rest of the world were appreciated.    <br />   Too bad the woman  whose boyfriend dumped her before she got around to dumping him allowed  herself to feel depressed.  There's no need for that.  I've had one of  those calls.  When the guy asked me if I minded, I referred to his new  girlfriend as my savior.  (No, that didn't start a feud.  They've been  married for years and we're all friends.)<br />   Sampling an author's work  for the first time is always a risk.  It's good to be able to say that I  didn't waste my money.   Ann E.

Ann Granger will gently fill you in on what has gone before.  Marby and Meredith's relationship moves forward by the  tiniest of steps, so you won't have missed much.  The murder weapon is  interesting.  The mystery unravels nicely.  You won't be sheltered from the  hard facts of life, but you won't have your nose rubbed in them, either.  Personally, I think every adulterer who thinks s/he is going to get away  with it should read this book.  It fits the old saying about being sure  that your sin will find you out.  (That's not giving away much.  It's  obvious early on that adultery is the root of the matter.)  I've always  enjoyed learning that an author whose works I like shares an interest.  I'm  pleased that Ms. Granger chose to mention *Sprig Muslin* of all of the late  Georgette Heyer's many regency romances, because that's my favorite of her  books.  (From the description of the cover, I'm sure that mine is a  different edition, though.)  For readers who are not familiar with Heyer's  work, she also wrote mysteries.  &quot;Penhallow&quot;, the name of one of  the characters in this book, is the title of one of Heyer's mysteries.  I  really, really, hate the fact that so many hardcover books have boring or  ugly dustjackets compared to paperback covers.  I'm pleased that this  mystery has a dustjacket that fits the mood of the book. [Note to the  publisher:  Given the title of the book, the last line of the quoted  epitaph should probably be &quot;call the dead&quot; instead of &quot;all  the dead&quot;.] Ann E.

This is THE fantasy book to give to friends who don't want to  read fantasy.  They'll get the basic idea in fewer pages than most epics,  and they'll probably enjoy it.

If you've read that earlier book you'll  enjoy reading how things turned out, and you should enjoy the book even if  you haven't.  Although, as another reviewer mentioned, it's easy to figure  out most of what's going on (once Hewlitt remembers his kitten's accident,  the incident with Morredeth is inevitable, etc.), that doesn't matter much.   Never mind the &quot;mystery&quot;, the book is worth reading for the  characters alone. I only wish, for new readers' sake, that series remained  in print as long now as they did when I was a girl.  The internet makes it  easier to find out-of-print books than it used to be, but that's no  substitute for being able to order all the earlier books from the  publisher.  Ann E. Nichols	1999-04-01

It's time for Major O'Mara to retire, and this book, like  O'Mara himself, moves from the present to the past, and back.  We learn  more about the early days of Sector General and O'Mara's role in bringing  about many items that are familiar to the series.  Although the final  revelation was obvious before chapter 15, that didn't spoil the book.   Everything leading up to the end was interesting.  I think anyone who cares  about O'Mara will be pleased at his fate. [Note to the publisher:  On  p.217, full paragraph one, Padre Lorien is named, but the context makes it  obvious that Padre Carmody is meant.  If that IS an error, you may wish to  correct it for the paperback.]  Ann E. Nichols	1999-04-01

As with Lorien in *The Genocidal Healer*, Gurronsevas is allowed to  learn and grow -- always to be welcomed in fiction.  I've read all the  previous Sector General books I love the fact that the aliens are fully  people in their own right and humans don't always hog the limelight.  The  official reviews are correct about the humor.  (The exchange two aliens  have over an old human saying cracked me up.)  I really enjoyed reading  about Gurronsevas' role in the first contact situation and the people he  tried to help.  I did have one minor problem with the book, though:  it was  too easy to figure out what was going on (although there were a couple of  things I didn't see coming).  However, I'm 44 years old and I have over 30  years' experience reading SF and mysteries.  Even if you're another  &quot;old&quot; fan, don't worry.  The book is well worth your time even  when you're mildly irritated at the characters for taking so long to catch  on. Ann E. Nichols	1999-03-28

If you're bothered by books where the male characters are mostly jerks  aren't your cup of tea, skip this one.  If you insist that your lead  characters be likeable and nice, forget it.  However, if you're willing to  suspend your disbelief and won't run away from a book that forces you to  face the problems of the homeless and the abused, this book is well worth  your time.  I'm only sorry that the author didn't bother to show why her  male characters became such unpleasant persons, as she did for the most of  the female characters.  It doesn't seem fair.  Of course, this book is  about unfairness.  I was deeply drawn into the story, but I'm a fan of  science fiction, fantasy, and horror/supernatural books as well as  mysteries.  I think this book would probably be more appreciated by fans of  those other genres.  Ann E. Nichols	1999-03-28

This book almost made me late for Mass, something which Ellie Haskell  would probably have understood.  How could I have possibly torn myself away  with a mere 25 pages remaining although time was running out?  I didn't and  I am unrepentant.  Karisma, the male cover model of the title, is a  hilarious spoof of Fabio.  (Neither is the man of MY dreams, but I am  repulsed by any man who looks as if he could snap my bones like twigs.)  I  loved the snatches of imaginary romance novels.  They reminded me of the  Barbara Cartlands and Harlequins I read when I was a teen, but these were  much funnier.  I think the late Georgette Heyer would have enjoyed them,  too -- she was so good at skewering the excesses of the genre.  The rest of  the book is the sort of fun I've come to expect from this series.  There  are so many twists and odd coincidences that I don't feel bad for coming to  the same spectacularly wrong conclusion that Ellie did.  Can't leave this  review without expressing my appreciation for the author's double nod to  Joan Hess when she announced that Zinnia Parrish would be writing a sequel  to a book by the late Azalea Twilight [see Hess's *Strangled Prose*].  Oh,  and I mustn't forget to rave about the cover!  It's a pity that Amazon.com  shows you only the front cover because the back cover is even better!  It's  delightful!  It's inspired!

I didn't buy the premise for a  moment because none of the nuns this Catholic-from-infancy reader has known  were even remotely this naive.  The young, leftover hippies had me  scratching my head until I looked and saw that this book came out in 1975.  The author has a MESSAGE to convey and is none too subtle about conveying  it.  What saves the story from being a preachy bore is the author's sense  of humor.  I liked it, but not well enough to keep, so I gave it to my  mother. Ann E. Nichols	1998-08-19

Paul Madriani's way of  telling the story didn't impress me at all.  Fortunately, the story itself  overcame that flaw.  Enjoyed reading about lawyers' tricks.  For most of  the book, Lenore gave me a pain because of her foolish actions, but she  made up for it at the end.  Part of the solution was a definite surprise(it  *was* irritating that Paul took so looooonnnnggg figuring out the  significance of the bear, though).  I'll have to give Mr. Martini points  for having Lenore miss the first part of the conversation with the cable  guy -- after all, Lenore might have read women's magazines, in which case  she could have warned Paul that he was being major league moronic.  Of  course, an action-packed scene that led to a nicely nasty payback wouldn't  have happened if she had.  I'm not sorry I read the book, but I don't plan  to keep it.

I particularly enjoyed:  the showdown with the punk kids in Atlantic City, meeting Joe's Grandma Bella (and the aftermath of that dinner), Lula's way of dealing with the infamous Joyce, and the creative [non-fatal] way an abused woman deals with her abuser.  Other comments:  Sally Sweet is a nice addition to the cast.  Lula is only 200 pounds?  She's lost 30 since the last book?  Stephanie isn't even remotely plump, so it's ridiculous for her to feel bad because she outweighs a teenager she meets.  She's supposed to!  There's an error on p.242 that I hope gets corrected for the paperback.  (It's the sentence near the bottom that starts with &quot;Got tire! d of sand...&quot;  Maxine's mother is doing the talking, but the book has it, &quot;Maxine said.&quot;) Ann E. Nichols	1998-08-06

For the most part this was a very good book with a lot of nasty twits that kept me on my toes. There were two things I deeply disliked about it, though.  The first was killing off one of the characters.  Second, as a fat [5' 1/2&quot;, 211 lbs] woman, I was not happy with the way Ms. Kijewski handled Patsy, a fat woman Kat meets at the Sunflower Clinic during her investigation.  Ms. Kijewski acts enlightened at first by having Patsy talk about the insults and verbal abuse that thin people feel free to hurl at fat people.  I was going to praise the author for recognizing that fat bigotry is just as wrong as any other form of fat bigotry.  Then she had Patsy act like a jerk, which gave Kat the opportunity to claim that she knew people who were slowly killing themselves through overeating.  Given the nature of Kat's investigation, I found the author's offer of understanding that was followed by a slap to the fat reader's face quite ironic. (Of course, if Kat doesn't stop eating the way she does in this book, she may experience fat abuse first hand.) Ann E. Nichol	1998-08-06

I didn't get caught up in this book for the mystery.  I cared so little about the mystery that I didn't try to solve it.  I was too caught up with the heroine, Lily Bard.  I understand how she feels.  What I went through was extremely mild compared to the horror that happened to Ms. Bard, though I was so young I didn't have a name for what happened to me.  I must compliment Ms. Harris for her portrayal of a former victim (a term I prefer to &quot;survivor&quot; because it contains both the idea that the victimhood is in the past and that the person was wronged, which &quot;survivor&quot; does not -- and I know English too well to be able to convince myself that I would feel &quot;empowered&quot; by calling myself a &quot;survivor&quot;, thank you very much).  I find Ms. Bard's feelings about her past utterly convincing.  I not only have NO problem with the decision she made during her ordeal, I applaud it (and I spit on her family for their reaction)!  The only thing I didn't like about this book was the fact that a separated man didn't wait until his divorce was final before having sex with a woman other than his couldn't-be-&quot;ex&quot;-soon-enough wife. I am getting the sequel. (Note to Ms. Harris:  These days the term is &quot;safer sex&quot; -- condoms aren't foolproof protection.  I am glad that you bother to address the topic, though.  Too many writers don't.)	1998-07-05

This sequel isn't quite as good as the original, but I'd still give it an &quot;A-&quot;.  You can expect more interesting stories of Mr. Payton and Mrs. Cheever's childhood (and I am green with envy over Mrs. Brace-Gideon's house.)  I can't believe this lovely book has been allowed to go out of print!	1998-06-26

(I was surprised to read that he didn't think much of the Sunday strip where Calvin imagines he's a god.  That's one of my all-time favorites!)  I wish that Mr. Watterson would create a Sunday-style page whenever the inspiration struck him -- and when he has enough for a book, put them together and publish them.  I'd gladly buy it!!!	1998-06-26

The heroine, Megan, is such a twit that she can't figure out that her beloved Edmund is a grade-A jerk.  The character who makes the book is Edmund's sister, Jane, a woman of intelligence, courage, and sense.  Sam, their kinsman, is a good character, too.  I spent much of the book wanting to shake some sense into Megan, but I kept on reading because I cared about Jane, Sam, and the townspeople.  The author's solution was what I figured would be the only way to bring a happy ending out of this mess, but I did not expect the method she used to pull it off.	1998-06-26

I'm fat (212 pounds) and I really didn't appreciate the way Holly Winter reacted to having the fat female malamute breeder touching her.  Although the puppy mill owner wasn't fat, whenever Ms. Winter imagined one, she always saw the villain as a fat man.  She even used the term &quot;pig&quot; in one description of his face.  For an author who has tried to combat other forms of prejudice in her novels to display the stereotype that fat people are physically and morally repulsive was very disappointing.  I hope that someday she realizes that fat people deserve to be treated with courtesy and respect, too.	1998-06-11

James	Books	5	1	1	N	N	This book needs to come back into print	I started reading this book the summer after 5th grade.  It scared me so much that I didn't finish it until I was 18.  Some modern readers may not care for the old-fashioned wording (and the lack of buckets of blood), but many of these stories are classics.  I don't scare as easily as I did when I was young (I'm 43), but I still read this book.	1998-06-11

I'm fat (212 pounds) and I found the author's attitude toward fat people, as revealed by her treatment of Angela Bowers, deeply offensive.  Sister Carol Anne O'Marie was kinder to the rapist than to this abused fat woman!  I found the author's evident hatred of fat people all the more sickening because I'm Catholic and she's a nun.  This was my 5th Sister Helen mystery and it's going to be my last.	1998-06-11

This book is no exception.  I particularly appreciated seeing the complete version of &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot;.  I'd like to see more of Mr. Lovecraft's work annotated.  I am surprised, though, that the section mentioning Lovecraft's work in films or on TV didn't list &quot;The Real Ghostbusters'&quot; hommage to Lovecraft, &quot;The Collect Call of Kathulu&quot; [correct episode spelling?].  If that's because the editor never saw that episode, I hope some kind fan will help out.	1998-06-11

There were several times (especially during some of those exchanges between Calvin and his father) I laughed as hard as if I were reading them for the first time.  My mother was in the hospital a couple of summers ago and she asked me to bring her my Calvin and Hobbes books.  I'm sure their humor helped with her recovery.  Yes, I love &quot;Dilbert&quot; and &quot;Fox Trot&quot;, but I MISS this guys.	1998-06-11
