This author's previous book, after which this one is titled, informed us how we should pass our time before we die, as well as outlining the considerable lengths to which we must go before we CAN die. This book provides a practical interface to the original; a blank-paged \\"tick-off\\" format with which we can chart our Dante-esque journey. This \\"travellers' book of the dead\\" is increasingly to be seen all around the world, clutched by grim processions of the travelling undead, who trudge miserably from place to place like legions of the damned, anxious to tick the next location off the list. Upon completion, this journal is presented as evidence to an impatient grim reaper, who then mercifully dispatches the traveller to their ultimate reward. The fact that this book helps with some \\"nuts-and-bolts\\" travel practicalities is all very well, but this does little to alleviate the grim finality of its ultimate destination.	2005-07-15

Once one's status as an HSP is established, by way of this book's sensitively provided self-tests, the book then goes on to provide the tools to categorise one's sensitivity-type (ST) even further. The rude and insensitive sector of the population (RAIPs) would no doubt be surprised to learn that there are several types of HSP, with different levels of sensitivity depending on the life domain. Introverted, creative, sociable, and worried HSPs everywhere will be grateful to have these tools at their fingertips to increase the depth of their self-awareness on the HSP scale.<br /><br />My own self-awareness journey, however, has been hampered from the beginning by the gaudy colouring of this book's pink and yellow striped cover, with bright green and red overlaid font. Can't the publishers provide a version of the book suitable for highly photosensitive types like myself? We HPSPs are too often undervalued and ignored by the HSP community in general.	2005-07-14

However, my wife (who doesn't have her own Amazon account) would like to make a few comments:<br /><br />\\"I recently decided to reconnect my reading journey with my life journey (and girls, that equals spiritual journey!). I had been reading books like 'Men are like fish', and thought about re-entering the world of dating. My girlfriends were like \\"You go girlfriend!\\", and my husband was encouraging, provided I had the right advice. Well, the best advice we could find was this book, which is from the male's perspective (we thought it best to adopt a common sense approach, without getting over-emotional about it, as I'm sometimes prone to do). Well, it's going great! Just the other day I signed on for a fly-fishing course in Montana, and my husband is doing a great job of keeping the house topped up with mice and spiders. Dating is clearly an end in itself, and the experiment is really getting somewhere!\\"	2005-07-13

After all, spousal compatability is the most important aspect of a lasting marriage. It does seem remarkable to me, though, that in 30 years of \\"mostly happy\\" marriage, the author never realised her husband was gay. Surely the marriage's general long-term happiness should have the author questioning her own status, vis-a-vis the whole gay issue? Different personality types and their relative compatibility are usually issues that are sorted out in the pre-marriage courting stage, or at least in the early stages of marriage. For it to take 30 \\"mostly happy\\" years for the author to realise her objections to her husband's gaiety indicates the likelihood that she had actually changed over time. It's natural for some people to become more melancholic and morose as they get older, but it seems a bit unreasonable to be taking it out on your spouse!	2005-07-08

The book covers a lot of ground in its suggestions for things to do (and places to go) before you die, and on the whole these things do generally indeed fulfil an undeniably high level of unforgettableness. Surely, however, in the given circumstances, unforgettableness is largely an irrelevant concept? With death just around the corner, quite unmemorable, quickly forgotten activities serve just as well to fill in the time.

This book, still popular and significant enough to be published in such a luxurious Anniversary Edition 50 long years after its original appearance, is a worthy subject for this genuine Cowhide Golden Anniversary Review.<br />Any 50-year-old book will inevitably raise some issues of currency and relevance, but these problems are compensated easily with Genuine Cowhide Burgundy binding. Apparently some misprint problems have also crept in since this book first appeared 50 years ago. These will hopefully be cleared up in time for the 100th Anniversary Edition, for the preparation of which I believe the publishers are already attempting to procure significant quantities of extremely rare \\"Texas Red\\" Book-Binding-Grade Cowhide.<br />In anticipation of the improved 100th Anniversary Edition, then, this 50th Anniversary Edition receives a suspended rating of 3 stars.

I think we can all agree that, although he depicted some perfectly pleasant scenes of quaint countryside and rural life, Van Gogh's approach to paint application and colour was way off. How many times did he spoil, say, a nice waving wheat scene with turmultuous swirling colours, giving a dark psychological insight into a tormented psyche, at odds with the scene depicted? He couldn't even paint a nice starry sky without expressing through colour, texture and dynamic motion a radical and unique vision of personal torment, at odds with the artistic conventions of the time. This book, then, is a godsend; a chance to rectify Van Gogh's stylistic mistakes in the area of colour application, while retaining the charming scenes of the French countryside.<br /><br />A word of warning, however: this book is really not suitable for children or similarly impressionable people. I gave it to a young nephew who, after spending quite some time colouring in the nice birds over the wheat field, cut his ear off!	2005-01-25

Any link to France, however indirect or vague, will always get me in. I love it when people use French words in conversation, or insist upon the inherent superiority of French cuisine. I'm fascinated by people's accounts of their travels in France and Paris (which, despite the ignorance of some, is actually IN France), and really appreciate the fact that people tend to like to recount them at great length. I treat books like \\"Almost French\\" almost as my guide to life, having burnt out on Tuscany a while ago, along with everyone else (that's in Italy). My wholehearted embrace of the idea of \\"France\\" as a fashion accessory serves me well in the social circles with which I'm acquainted (originally a French word).<br /><br />This book does a good job of catering to my superficial fascination for all things \\"a la Francoise\\", but suffers from one fatal defect. Although I have never been to France or met any French people, I have seen plenty of photos, and from these it can easily be ascertained that, contrary to this book's most prominent claim, there are, in fact, quite a significant number of fat French women. Of course, \\"fat\\" itself is not such a vulgar concept in France, where, according to my Francophilic acquaintances, folk prefer to refer to the overweight as \\"fillesse des osseau grande\\". It has so much more style in French...<br /><br />In summary, I give this book a gallic deux stelle.	2005-01-21

The controversy, of course, isn't so much over the fact that there are a lot of fat people - this is indisputable; just have a look around you. No, the controversy arises over society's attitudes toward and judgement of people who are fat.<br />In line with this book, many would claim that people should be judged on \\"who they are\\", not what they look like. To me this is debatable, since it's impossible to know \\"who a person is\\" on the inside. Outward appearances are usually all you have to go on. Besides, surely the full definition of \\"who a person is\\" (and subsequent judgements) must also incorporate their physical appearance? Also, you often find that what you thought were well-founded judgements you've made on a particular person are later proven wrong by the person's actions.<br />I'm not a fat person myself, so am well-versed in judging the external appearances of fat people, and am well cognisant of the fact that their fat exterior can stand in the way of my judging the person underneath. To conclude, in my experience, fat people are often just as unpleasant as the general population, so to me it's as good a guide as any.	2004-12-23

Of course it's difficult to place all the complexities of a person's &quot;relationship style&quot; completely within one of the five love languages cited in this book (quality time, words of affirmation, gifts, acts of service, and physical touch), but, using these five as a general guideline, my dominant love language is &quot;physical touch&quot;, while my mate's is &quot;acts of service&quot;. Our relationship functions reasonably well on this basis; if my mate starts moving out of her assigned love language style, as she is sometimes prone to do, I'm usually fairly quick to make sure she gets back into it.<br />However, despite being quite aware and mostly accepting of our respective love language styles, as recommended in this book, I sometimes suspect that this is not the full picture, and there is perhaps still something missing in our relationship in terms of communication. I'm not sure if perhaps there's something missing from my partner's copy of the book, and she's not fully grasping the issues?

However, I don't believe that businesses can afford to take matters into their own hands to the extent recommended in this book. It may be true that without execution, breakthrough thinking on managing change breaks down, and it also may be true that a certain amount of discipline is necessary for getting things done, but surely condoning and encouraging execution itself is taking things a bit far.

The issue, as far as this particular book is concerned, is that I'm actually quite good looking. Many girls (and some boys!) have commented on my good looks, and I find that my looks serve me well in the game of picking up girls. Of course, I can't expect Amazon to be aware of this fact, since to my knowledge they've never seen me, but by hereby providing this information, perhaps it can be taken into account for future recommendations? If anyone would like photographic evidence of the fact that I'm not an average looking guy, please email me.

Love is supposedly idealistic and blind, but people tend to fall in love with people of their own level of physical attractiveness and of similar material aims. Financial and materialistic matters clearly come into it a lot when females select love partners - a tradition which has never really died off, just as the male focus on appearance and physical attributes has never altered.<br />Some of us, however, are being left behind in this area, and are still naively blundering along, falling in love for all the wrong reasons, or, worst of all, for no reason at all. I find myself falling for women just on the basis of a random smile or the way they look at me or laugh or flick their hair. For this reason I find myself falling in love with women who aren't necessarily particularly attractive in social terms, or don't necessarily share any of my attitudes or aims in regards to career and finance.<br />A book like this could therefore be a godsend to old-fashioned folk like me, who are falling in love for the wrong reasons. Rather than allowing love to happen randomly, or for that matter through business-like love arrangements in the aristocratic tradition, we now have the power to manipulate an actual love-response in whoever we choose, by encouraging the production of phenylethylamine in their brain. This is surely the most promising aid to self-gratification in the area of gender-relations since those &quot;x-ray specs&quot; they used to advertise in comics. No more do we need to worry about our physical appearance, social status, and wealth (and lack thereof) in seeking love partners. Science-nerds can finally gain the upper hand in the dating game, as their skills in chemical manipulation lead them out of the science lab and into the bedroom! Also, the mental pain and anguish of shallow one-night-stands and unsatisfying relationships based on lust are a thing of the past, now that we can chemically manufacture real love! Unhappy marriages everywhere can benefit from these discoveries; older couples whose passion has run out, or couples who are together for reasons other than love in the first place, can now discover or rediscover the passion of the real thing, just by playing with each other's phenylethylamine levels.uish of shallow one-night-stands and unsatisfying relationships based on lust are a thing of the past, now that we can chemically manufacture real love!

How can I overcome my barriers and begin to access intention as a field of energy? I don't want to be left behind in co-creating my life with the power of intention.<br />I think intention alone is not enough, and people often have to be forcibly acquainted with creativity, kindness, love, beauty, expansion, abundance and receptivity.

Aimless lives and purposeless churches alike are everywhere being sent cowering under the onslaught of multiple &quot;purpose-driven(R)&quot; titles. And the secret? If you ask me, the key to these books' popularity is that they offer an easier, more practical Christian framework to people who find the traditional Christian habits and traditions out of place in today's purpose-driven world. According to this book, the key to effective living is apparently the five God-ordained purposes: &quot;worship, community, discipleship, ministry and evangelism&quot;. The 10 commandments are thereby halved, making the whole thing much easier to remember, and more in line with today's busy lifestyle. Let's face it, people nowadays don't have time for any of that awkward and archaic stuff about coveting thy neighbour's ox! What a God-send for the author to have stumbled upon this &quot;God-ordained&quot; principles short-cut (pun intended of course). I'm sure he's giving God a financial share in the &quot;purpose driven&quot; trademark.<br />The footnotes question posed by this book is, I'm sure, leading to much heated discussion among Christians, both purpose-driven and non-purpose-driven alike. 18 footnotes out of 800 not referring to Christian Scriptures is a controversially high proportion, as I'm sure most Christians would agree, both the purpose-driven variety and the old-fashioned sort. I guess the fact that the author was purpose-driven enough to get 800 footnotes in there in the first place means he should be forgiven the 18 lapses, especially since it would take an extremely purpose-driven reader to read all of them anyway.<br />In conclusion, I give this book a purposeful 3 stars.	2004-03-04

I've always found it difficult to know how to respond when I find out that someone is gay, and it's even more confusing and potentially devastating if it's someone close to you, like a family member or someone you love. Acceptance would be one straightforward option, if it weren't such a challenging concept in the context of \\"family\\", or someone you \\"love\\". This book's emphasis seems to be in trying to make the gay person realise that they can change, and then applying whatever pressure is necessary to make them do so. This is all very well, but in my experience gay people are usually very reluctant to change, and even claim that their gaiety is something they're born with. We more melancholy members of society can find such attachment to gayness disconcerting, and it's therefore understandable that members of a morose family would want to undermine any gayness in their midst at whatever cost. Some would say that people of all temperaments across the whole range of emotions, from ecstatic elation to suicidal depression, just have to accept each other and get on with things the best they can. However, this doesn't take into account the fact that, as highlighted by this book, love often necessitates cruelty, especially where excessive gaiety is concerned.	2004-03-02

Since life as an HSP is such a challenge, it's a satisfying thing to find a whole franchise of books catering to all the different aspects of being sensitive in an insensitive world (SIAUW). It's very sensitive of the author to be catering to this need among the highly strung.	2003-11-08

Gone are the days when the womenfolk were happy with a nice frock and a husband with a steady income. These days the ladies all seem to want to be one of these new-fangled fancy &quot;stereotypes&quot; that are all the rage. It may come as a surprise to the author that there are some women who cannot be fitted into any one of these fashionable &quot;stereotypes&quot;, and instead prefer a combination of several of them. I give this book 3 stars, as it seems well put together, but I wouldn't advise any of the ladyfolk to be reading this kind of thing, since it could give them ideas.	2003-11-07

Those of us who are spiritual people know that it is a spiritual thing to receive. A lot of spiritual self-help literature seems to focus on finding peace or your place in the world, but getting things is sometimes under-represented. Apparently receiving is simply a matter of having the &quot;courage&quot; and &quot;insight&quot; to realise that desire for things is God-given. This is gratifying for spiritual people like myself, who already know what a wonderful thing it is to receive, or be given, things. All you need is to want them, and then ask for them. This proactive stance gives us more power over our own lives by catering to our desires, and spirituality is the winner! There are not many pages in this book, though, so I don't feel as if I've received as much as I might have. This book therefore receives 3 stars from me.	2003-11-07

Among the many accumulated objects cluttering up my house and my life is my vast collection of books about feng shui. I keep moving these piles and rows of books around the house, trying to find the best position for them. No matter what I do, though, the books keep collecting dust and stagnant energy, and I can't get rid of the clutter and negative symbology. This book has inspired me, though, to do something about these undesirable life patterns, and thus rid myself of both ambiguous purpose and unfinished emotional business. Once I dispose of my cluttering collection of feng shui self-help literature, I'm expecting my spiritual and emotional clutter to vanish along with it. My only dilhemma is  this book: if I get it, the cycle of clutter may begin again. For this reason, I'll give it only 2 stars, since I'm sure it's the first step on a slippery slope.	2003-11-07

I wouldn't question the dietician credentials of this author, and don't doubt that they probably have many good ideas about applying common sense to healthy cooking and eating. Common sense, however, should also tell you right from the start that, no matter how healthy and well worked out your diet selection is, guzzling it all down quickly is not going to be good for you. What's the point of putting so much effort and research into the food itself, only for it to be wolfed down in 5 minutes?	2003-11-06

When Aristotle inaugurated the concept of scientific study, &quot;science&quot; was just one component of the whole broader area of &quot;learning&quot;. Since that time, new discoveries in science have often led to major technological and social developments in the world, not to mention quite a lot of excitement. Occasionally they can also lead to the invention of a &quot;new science&quot; in itself, as one area of inquiry gains focus and breaks off from its broader parent disciplines. I guess it's a sign of the times nowadays that when a new science emerges it's published as self-help literature. The fad for specialised scientific journals empirically following specific and specialised lines of enquiry has, like all such passing fads, died. If any of those olden-days scientists like Eisenstein or Newton-John were publishing today, they'd be up against the likes of this book in the competition for the attention of the scientific world and the public.<br />The new science of &quot;Personal Achievement&quot; is pithily summarised in faculty handbooks as &quot;performing at your peak while gaining emotional and financial freedom, attaining leadership and self-confidence, and winning the cooperation of others&quot;. This book is surely worth at least 2 stars, since it's the ground-breaker for this brave new science, devoted to bettering quality of life for all humanity through extensive experimental research and dedicated data collection.	2003-11-06

Some men lament the fact that women only want them as \\"friends\\", and not as lovers. Well, I wouldn't be complaining, since I invariably repulse women in either context. At least if you were friends with women it would increase your opportunities to try to convince them to sleep with you. As for me, I go through life lamenting the lost chances and missed opportunities; standing on the sidelines lusting after beautiful women, knowing that they are forever out of my reach. Don't get me wrong, I don't limit my desires only to beautiful women; I would be happy with pretty much any woman, no matter how ugly. And it's not as if I expect only sex; I'd be happy just for them not to turn away in revulsion whenever I offend their vision with my abhorrent presence. My own self-loathing is matched and surpassed only by the regard in which I am held by women. It's good that there is a book like this, promising to solve my problem. My only concern is whether it can give any hope to someone like me, with no redeeming social qualities whatsoever. Nowadays there are many \\"guide to success\\" books on the market, and the numbers seem to be increasing at an exponential rate. Increasing at a similarly exponential rate is the proportion of thoroughly miserable, worthless outcasts like myself. It's good to see that everyone's needs can be catered to by a self-help book, so I give this one 3 stars.	2003-11-05

Like many people, I am continually affronted by those leading an openly gay lifestyle, and I feel this to be an infringement of my rights. I feel marginalised, like my own rights are in competition with other groups around me. Gay homosexuals have dominated the discourse for far too long, and it's good to see their previously unassailable position of power and social acceptance finally challenged, even if it is challenged from such an underfunded, underdog position as \\"Christianity\\". My right to be morose and melancholy has been openly mocked for too long by the unrelenting merriment around me. It's good to see someone fighting back. I can't bring myself to give this book more than 2 stars, however, because of the disturbing depiction of gaiety on the cover.	2003-11-04

There are many of these sort of month-to-month guides for expectant mothers, but for some reason expectant fathers seem to have been left out of the equation. In the past, I guess expectant fathers needing advice had to use one of the guidebooks for expectant mothers - surely leading to potentially dangerous birth situations, since women's biology and anatomy is so different from men's. It's all very well for expectant mothers, who are, after all, just following a fairly standard and well sign-posted path. Expectant fathers, however, surely need as much guidance as they can get!	2003-11-04

I'm sure that the question &quot;why do bad things happen to good people?&quot; is one of the big questions that spiritually-minded people have always asked themselves. Even non-spiritual people may also find themselves dealing with this issue, if they are ever unfortunate enough to have something bad happen to them. It's good that there is a book like this, in case such people need something to read on the subject. As a very spiritual person myself, though, I find myself much more likely to be pondering the opposite question : why do good things happen to bad people? This phenomenon can be just as distressing, if not even more so, depending on how spiritual you are. The two things are very related - both questions stem from our wish to get all the good things for ourselves, and give all the bad things to someone else. Why bother being good if I don't get good things? Why don't I just be bad? I'd be just as likely to get good things anyway. The moral and spiritual question of how to palm off all the bad things onto someone else, while skimming off all the good things for ourselves, has always apparently tortured us, and never more so in this age of envy and greed. Where is the motivation for doing or being &quot;good&quot; if good things go to bad people? Considering this book was written 20 years ago, you'd think it could have been updated by now to incorporate this more spiritual approach to the subject.	2003-10-31

Sure, there may be some bad things going on in the world, but most of them are not having too obvious an impact on the practicalities of my own life, and many of them I needn't even be aware of. One of the big trends these days seems to be for people similar to myself to become superficially interested in world issues and the supposed causes for suffering and exploitation in the world. This book thereby finds its market, and, if it's anything to go by, apparently a lot of the suffering and exploitation is connected with the ways that wealth and power are being wielded and exploited. Personally, I would have thought it a bit far-fetched to be claiming that corporate global capitalism is in some ways only focussed on its own financial and material gain. It's fine with me though, since, as a non-wealthy and non-powerful type person, it means I needn't accept any personal responsibility. For its comforting message, then, I give this book 3 stars.	2003-10-31

The whole contemporary craze for travelling itself has more or less passed me by. As I get older, though, I tend to get increasingly anxious about all the places in the world I haven't seen yet, and a book like this is bound to present me with many travel ideas I hadn't considered. The book's emphasis, though, presents a somewhat disturbing scenario to all potential readers. On one hand, it's good that, by making the list so long, the author is encouraging us to live for a long time, but what about those of us whose time is running out? For an untravelled person in their autumn years, 1000 places is an awful lot to be expected to get through, and attempting it could even shorten whatever time they have left. Conversely, younger, well-travelled people, who have already been to all 1000 places, will be disturbed to learn that they have nothing left to live for...	2003-10-29

Surely the author doesn't expect anyone to understand this? By putting &quot;via&quot; between &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;nurture&quot;, the author has broken one of the golden rules of getting people's attention. Surely it must be one or the other? &quot;Nature versus nurture&quot; has always been one of the most preferred dichotomous platitudes. It may be considered clever in certain circles to insinuate further levels of complexity over and above the basic &quot;black or white&quot; framework we all know and love, but it won't win any popularity contests! Due to my confusion, I give this book 2 stars out of 5.	2003-10-28

However, I can't help but feel a certain redundancy in its self-congratulatory tone and focus. Of course gay men have the same right as anyone to improve their lives, but surely it can't be a high priority for them. How about some life-improvement ideas for morose and melancholy men? They are really the ones who need cheering up.	2003-10-28

I have an average income, but, like many people, I have a burning desire to be more wealthy, so as to raise my social status above those around me. Books like this one seem designed for the purpose of informing people specifically how they could achieve this. However, although I'm no Einstein, it seems that this particular book's exclusionist nature may well leave me out. People like myself may only constitute a small market segment, but aren't we worth considering too? Why should I be excluded from the exciting wealth and investment opportunities referred to in this book? Perhaps the author would be wealthier from sales of their book if they had thought about this earlier.	2003-10-26

This author would seem to be onto something in their analysis of some of the ways in which our children are being raised to be joyless and selfish. My concern is, that after all the progress that civilisation has made over such a long period to get things where they are now, should we be poking holes in the standards and norms of our society, just when we've got it how we want it, and it's working most smoothly? It's all very well to be saying that we shouldn't be raising joyless, selfish children, but if we don't raise them like this, how are our they going to function in our society? If we raise joyFUL, selfLESS children, who will be the willing lawyers, accountants, factory workers, computer scientists etc. of the future? We all know that joyful, selfless children are unemployable, and fall by the wayside, as the more evolutionarily adapted members of society push them out of the picture. If joyfulness and selflessness were the norm, our society as we know it would crumble. Perhaps we should think about that before we go finding fault with the way things are, because they're like that for a reason.	2003-10-24

I have plenty of material possessions and wealth, but find them totally ungratifying. On the other hand, I also yearn for more: bigger, more luxurious and up-to-date models of the material possessions I have, and more wealth than I have. It's as if no matter how much I have, it's never enough. It's the same with my personal and emotional life - I have very good relationships with those close to me, but feel unsatisfied by them and find myself wanting something more from somewhere else. I neither have what I want nor want what I have. It's as if my desires are locked in a self-defeating spiral, like the heads of a two-headed serpent from Greek mythology or a Harryhausen film, eating each other, oblivious to the fact that they are not only destroying each other, but in so doing are also destroying themselves. Or something like that, anyway. This book, then, seems perfectly tailored to my needs. I have many self-help books on these kinds of subjects clogging up my spacious and highly desirable house, but experience (and my very desirable wife) has told me that none of them will satisfy me, so I don't want them any more. This book, however, seems just the thing for me. It seems to be addressing the exact issues I'm facing, so I want it. I'm worried though - if I get this book, will I then not want it? While I'm dealing with this quandary, I'll give this book 3 stars.	2003-10-23

I like reading those books about how the pyramids were built by a lost race from outer space, and how all world power stems from a Freemason/Knights of Malta conspiracy dating back 700 years, involving the Holy Grail and the nail-clippings of Christ. I'm also very much in favour of the ever-fashionable fictional technique of turning history to mush. Like most people, I'd much rather read a poorly written &quot;thriller&quot; with plot complexity and page mass in place of character, profundity or truth, catering to the paranoias and neuroses of the masses than, say, a history book. Here, finally, is apparently a book that combines all of my interests. I haven't managed to get around to reading it yet, however, because I'm still struggling through &quot;The Lost Druid Tribe of Atlantis: How A Race Of Ancient Druids Invented The 'Popular Esoteria' Genre From The Primordial Soup&quot;.

A blurb for this book says it's a \\"12-page self-help booklet that provides unconventional tools for self-improvement with stuttering\\". I can only commend the author and question any detractors on this matter. Just because a tool is unconventional doesn't mean it won't work. If a drill is too unconventional a tool for people to be using, they should feel free to use more conventional ones, like hammers or spanners or whatever. But I say why stop at the drill? Many stutterers may find relief in even more unconventional tools, like angle grinders or rotary hoes, and if so why shouldn't they use them? I give this book 5 stars for its fresh new perspective on the usefulness of household tools in the treatment of stuttering. Perhaps other disciplines should open themselves up to this new perspective; for example has anyone looked into the effectiveness of power-saws or rivet-guns in treating schizophrenia?	2003-10-21

When I read a book, I like to get the &quot;warm and fuzzies&quot; and receive a &quot;life affirming&quot; message. I'm also a big fan of &quot;feel-good&quot; books and movies, as a genre. This book is almost universally described as &quot;life affirming&quot;. It makes heaven seem like a wonderful place, since you meet people from your past, and learn heart-warming spiritual lessons from them in ways that you never would have expected. However, there is confusion in a couple of areas that need clarification. How can a &quot;life affirming&quot; book be promoting the idea of death (ie, going to heaven)? The author cannot have it both ways here, unless they subscribe to the strange idea that death is in some way life affirming. Also, what's the point of learning important spiritual lessons about life and about yourself when it is, by definition, too late? (ie, you're dead). This could be an OK book, but if the author were to clear up these points of confusion we'd all be better off.	2003-10-21

It's an intrinsic and essential feature of my profession. I thought I knew pretty much all there was to know - that is, until I saw this book. It claims to cover everything, and I must admit even I would be hard pressed to come up with 22 laws. Personally, I find some of the concepts apparently introduced in this book a bit far-fetched; I can't imagine how an idea like &quot;branding people's minds&quot; could be put into practice, nor, indeed, why you would want to. And as for &quot;branding over the internet&quot;, well, to me that's just pure science fiction. Branding is a fairly personal thing, though, and everyone has their own tricks and techniques.

I'm a very spiritual person, so these kinds of books are my kind of thing. I'm the first to dispense with traditional science and biology when it's convenient, since they're very complicated, and they don't cater to the emotional and spiritual needs of the ordinarily-minded person. A book like this one should give those of us who choose to turn our backs on &quot;proper&quot; science something to focus on instead in our search for health, longevity and freedom from pain. However, if we're replacing all the discoveries and benefits of science, it should be with something MORE intuitive, something MORE spiritually simple, than what traditional science and medicine have to offer. Otherwise, where's the alternative? If spirituality has to be so complex, we may as well just accept what we're running from in the first place: empirically measurable knowledge. I give this book two stars since, at 320 pages long, it's unlikely I'll ever read it.	2003-10-18

I have spent my life bound by fear, unable to fully express myself both physically and emotionally. My flow is blocked. I feel like a puppet going through the motions, an empty echo of the empty society around me. I should also explain that I love these kind of books - I feel this kind of inspirational product is just the thing to get me seizing control of my life, stopping my bad habits, following my dreams, and achieving the impossible. My problem is that I feel blocked; I can't get past the first page. I try to read, and I can't get past even the first few lines. I try to make up my own breathing-flow exercises and motivational techniques to continue, but they get me nowhere because I have no expertise or aptitude in that area. I have the same problem with pretty much all self-help literature - once the marketing megalith motivates me to purchase it, my motivation fails me when it comes to reading it.<br />For this reason, I give this book a four star score, since I'm sure it's my own failings, rather than those of the book or the author, that prevent me from reading it.	2003-10-17

This lady apparently passed herself off as a &quot;trailer trash&quot; to write this book about how poorer people live in America. This kind of experiment is all very well, but it seems a bit too easy to me. Surely we'd get more interesting results if it was done the other way round? Why don't any members of the working poor write a book about their experiences as, say, a highly paid academic researcher or manager of a large company? This would provide far more worthwhile insights than this book probably does. People are tired of hearing about poverty anyway, and would rather read about the humourous situations that could arise from a genuine &quot;trailer trash&quot; out of place in the corporate boardrooms of the big end of town, or comically stumbling around the big ivory towers of academia. It could then be made into a moving &quot;fish out of water&quot; comedy film with heart starring Tom Hanks.

Apparently this author thinks Americans are afraid of the wrong things. I'm going by the book's subtitle, since I haven't read the book - I probably won't have time to read it either, especially since it's not the sort of thing I tend to read. On this occasion I can't be bothered reading any of the reader reviews either. Well, if the author believes that Americans are afraid of the wrong things, what does he think Americans should be afraid of? Surely it's not enough to just leave it at that - the author shouldn't just be focussing on the negative without providing some alternatives. This is a common problem with our society nowadays - people complaining about the way things are without suggesting alternatives.	2003-10-07

Another one of those &quot;spiritual enlightenment&quot; books then. This one seems better than most, since it emphasises the present, as opposed to past lives or predicting the future. On the other hand, it's all very well to talk about &quot;now&quot; as the best time to seize the moment, etc. but what about people who don't have the option? It's like taunting them; they feel like they're missing out, while everyone is talking about how great &quot;now&quot; is. &quot;Now&quot; is the latest thing - get yours before it's too late. Talking about &quot;spiritual enlightenment&quot; at all is always a bit iffy too - it can be a bit like an exclusive club catering to people's need for belonging. I wouldn't necessarily accuse this book of that, however. In fact I wouldn't accuse it of much at all, since I haven't read it and have no intention of doing so. It's just not my kind of thing, although I did read an Alan atts book once...	2003-10-07

Is this some sort of claim that the media is biased one way or another? It doesn't strike me as very likely that the author is going to be able to convince anyone either way, since people tend to have very strong opinions about these things - they'll either be reading it to support their own biases, or to &quot;know the enemy&quot;, so to speak. Having said that, it could be an interesting read if you're interested in these kinds of things. I'm not myself, and can't really imagine reading this book under pretty much any circumstances whatsoever. I nonetheless give it 3 stars, since it would be unfair to harshly judge something I haven't read and have very little interest in.	2003-10-07

I don't see why the author of this book should have such a chip on their shoulder about fast food. I'm guessing here of course, since I haven't actually read the book, but if the author had their way we'd all be waiting in line for food to be served at a relaxed, unhurried pace. In this day and and age, this is simply not going to cut it, since many people depend on being able to get their food as soon as they order it, sometimes even directly through the window of their automobile. I'm not sure if the author is aware of this. Call me confused, but if you take that away from people, they'll probably revert back to bringing packed sandwiches from home, perhaps with a flask of their favourite beverage, since they won't have the time to buy their food from the long-winded commercial outlets. Don't blame the food - it's just trying to keep up with the general pace of life nowadays...	2003-10-07

Books	4	11	19	N	N	Timely book	This is a good book, and it's no more timely now than never before. Much that has been written on the subject of before 9/11 has come to shed light on the post-9/11 world, and none more so than this book. The truth cannot be kept from the American people for too long, and many won't fail to prevent it by reading this book. If Bowling for Columbine talked about guns and easy targets, this talks the issues a step further. It's a shame people have to criticise what they think they don't understand.	2003-10-03
