I picked up the audio book at the library.  I was hooked within the first 3 minutes. Honey Beth is everyone's high school nightmare... rich, popular, blond and perfect. I loved her sense of humor and unbreakable spirit.  Her interactions with Colin were a hoot. The only thing I have negative to say about the audio version is the narrators awful British accent. I kept picturing Hugh Grant's voice... much more appropriate. I usually listen to books on cd on my way to work and on road trips. I took this one inside and listened to it for two days until I devoured all 11 hours. I found myself laughing out loud and mumbling to myself like a nut. So if you're looking for something entertaining especially for a long commute this is a good pick!	2005-04-22

This is the first book I've ever read by Debbie MacOmber but won't be the last!  I first picked it up because I'm a knitter and pretty obsessed right now with the craft. I thought the premise was interesting. The character's are all in need of friendship however, they have little in common other then the desire to knit.  Isn't that how some of the best and most varied relationships begin. I loved the growth of characters through the book and the time the author took to honor each of the characters. The women in this book are all daring, brave and in for a lot of personal growth which MacOmber harvest throughout the book. I was sad to see it end! Thanks!	2004-06-18

I don't play golf, watch golf or even play an impressive round of putt putt. This is the third Feinstein golf book I've read and probably the best. I was amazed not only by the power of the story but once again at Feinstein's writing power. I first experienced it when I happened upon my ex-husbands \\"A Good Walk Spoiled\\" and thought I'd read a few chapters until I got to the library to pick up something I wanted to read... 544 pages later I was fired up and completely engaged in the world of golf. Since then I have suggested that book to everyone I know who even has a mild interest in golf and many who don't. I was sitting in a hotel room in California when I saw on the news that Bruce Edwards had died. I immediately ordered \\"Caddy for Life\\". Feinstein had me hooked after the first page of the introduction. He has helped share the legacy of Bruce Edwards with a non-golfer like me. He treated Edward's life with dignity and compassion while giving the special gift of letting the reader meet the remarkable man which Bruce Edwards embodied. He will be missed not only on the golf green but also on this planet. Read this book... may we all be able to live a life as intentional and giving as Bruce Edwards.	2004-05-27

The reader finally after 4 books really has a good grasp of all the players and is comfortable with them. This allows JK to take storytelling to a new level. This is by far my favorite of the series up to now. Not to ruin anything but to say I applaud JK for continuing to keep me on my toes and fascinated with Harrys story. To watch how Harry struggles with both the routine of his academic arena along with the political events occurring with the dark lord is storytelling at its best. I cannot recall a series a well written as this one. Cant wait to see what happens next!	2003-06-26

I am not a Christian however was raised in the Christian church. Thus I am familiar with the tales of Joseph, Jacob and his wives, ect. However, I have a renewed appreciation for these characters. What a rich book on the strength and sisterhood of women. Where the bible many times neglects herstory, this book offers an unique look at complex bonds and friendships between women, sisters and mothers/daughters. It also honors women spirit. The strong theme of birth, menstruation, coming of age are incredible. I highly recommend this book. What a unique take on both Jacob and Joseph also.	2003-06-26

I found the text to have good examples of HR practices however, to be unorganized in fashion. It was not an easy text to follow as it jumps around a lot.

It sucked me in. There are few books that do this and when I happen upon one that does I have learned to enjoy the ride... even if it's disturbing. The book tells about Augusten's childhood as he saw things... all the little conversations and beliefs that kids devise to make sense of their world are in this book. His mother is seeing a shrink and since he is a doctor Augusten has many beliefs about how a doctor would live. When he finds out the opposite and is plopped down in the surreal, strange and stinky home of Dr. Finch, he is disturbed. But what happens is very interesting... over time he adjust (as kids do) and makes the best of it. Many readers seem to be disturbed by the graphic content. Well, that's ok... the relationship that Augusten had with an adult man and was allowed to have was abusive. The book talks about the relationship as a teen-ager would see it. It's real.  I applaud Augusten with sharing his freakish tales with us. Is it funny... well, in some places I guess... funny in the sense in someone falling down a flight of stairs is funny. It makes you cringe and look away but you inevitably look back.	2003-06-20

I am currently a Masters level student who is taking a Governmental Accounting course. I have found this text to be somewhat confusing. The chapters and the information are very detailed however, the study questions introduce new terms and are hard to follow. This makes for a complicated and frustrating process for anyone who has not had a previous accounting course. I understand that there are not many books out there on this topic. However, a study guide or even the assistance of a glossary and some consistency in phrasing questions to be similar to the text would help. If I can't understand what the question is asking how am I to know if I understand what I thought I just read. The lack of pictures and graphics does not bother me and the blue ink while hard to get used to is easier on my eyes. The Powerpoint presentations were also helpful.	2003-01-31

Even if you are familiar with the Anne Boleyn and Henery VIII saga you will find new intrigue with this captivating book.  Written in first person from the prospective of Mary Boleyn who was intimate with the King years before her sister. This book tells Mary's story with is completely imeshed with her sister Anne's.  The Boleyn family is portrayed in a less then golden light as the family attempts to weave themselves into court life and gain the advantage over the Seymours (ultimately failing).  Anne and Mary are simply pawns in a sick and twisted game.  Anne is very unlikable in this novel however, it's not clear as to rather she is more tragically a causality of her family and the times.  Mary's hostility and love for her sister is as confusing and complex as any sibling relationship.  I celebrate when Mary is able to find true love and break free of the family cycle... if we could all be as strong as Mary perhaps we too will live happily ever after. Enjoy!	2002-07-10

Barbara Holland's book \\"They Went Whistling\\" is a delight!  Holland uses wit, sarcasm and a vast knowledge of many incredible women. This book highlights not only well known women (Cleopatra, Joan of Arc) but also remarkable lesser known women. These ladies were not the \\"fairer sex\\" by any means.  Their stories exude courage, brawn and too little glory.  For those looking for some herstory this book is a MUST read.  I found myself laughing, gasping and making list of women who I wanted to read more about. The stories blend together beautifully in a easy and smooth flow.  Holland's wit is so catching and real I soon felt like she was a good friend or relative telling me stories of the past.  Thank you Ms. Holland for the education and experience.	2002-06-24

I loved this book!  Jack is a crack pot law student coming home to find his brother is dead and the arms of the rich are ever reaching!

After reading a Blue Place and Stay, I searched for more of Griffith's works.  I am not usually interested in sci-fi or futuristic novels. However, Griffith makes her characters interesting and her story-line not only complex and multi-dimensional but she also has a way of feeding you information in bits and pieces. This effect could be frustrating but her transition between first and third person works similar to meeting someone new for the first time and then learning more and more about them over time. Lore (the main character) begins as a privileged prodigy victim of a kidnaping to a twisted victim who in the end discovers her true better self. While the beginning was hard to get interested in (probably due to my aversion to science fiction)... once I got going I was hooked!  Enjoy!	2002-06-02

James Patterson's ability to create complex psychological thrillers, which celebrate friendships, dedication and wit, continues in his second Women's Murder Club novel.  I love that the female protagonists are real people who have hurts, lives and dimension. They are allowed to love without being weak or overly romantically foolish and they are above all intelligent thinking women.  2nd Chance takes the reader on a wild ride of what appears to be a racially motivated string of murders.  However, it goes deeper then that. The murder seems to be after several members of the Women's Murder Club.  Be prepared to be swept away with a fast paced story and some new characters.  I found myself several times gasping and saying out loud \\"No Way!\\"  But just like always, James Patterson shows us there is a way.	2002-04-05

A story told in the first person of a 15 year old girl visiting with her relatives in India. The story depicts Maya's struggles with mixing Indian culture and American culture. Told in a very respectful and vivid manner this book gave me new understanding of Indian life.  The most poignant part of Motherland is the relationship between Maya and her grandmother (Ammamma) who raised her for the first four years of her life. Adolescence can strain any and all family relationships at times. This story shows how special the relationships between grandmothers and granddaughters can be. Being very close to my own grandmother and losing her at age 16, Motherland brought back a lot of fond memories of my own relationship with my Ammamma.	2001-05-08

I wonder where we would all be if we could simply do the same.  Perhaps not the in your face shocker it was when first published this book has not lost any of it's charm. Not only do I admire the adoption story line (as I am adopted also) but also the transitions of coming out.  Even though now lesbian characters are seen on almost every tv series... mis-nomers and prejudice still haunt us. I believe Rita Mae Brown wrote a timeless classic with Rubyfruit Jungle and gave lesbian literature its own hero.	2001-03-14

All the things that have kept me stuck and stunted in my spirituality were addressed by Father Leo in a realistic and nurturing way. He suggest we clear out our &quot;God Box&quot; those things that keep us beat down, guilty and judged in our religions and work on co-creating our destinies with God.  I now know I have a lot of work to do with my spiritual side... I've simply been lazy due to my fears.

First it was his ability as a caucasian man to characterize an african-american character with such larger then life greatness (Kiss the Girls, Along Came A Spider, etc). Now he takes my breath away with his characterization of two young pregnant virgins. His depiction of their struggles as well as the members of the church sent to investigate these phenomena.  The story of the second holy child in a time where plagues and the wrath of God appear to be crushing every corner of the world. Set in modern day... Patterson's story is focused on the two girls and not as much the plagues and trials of the world.  However, the characters have a tendency to grab a hold of you and take you with them. If you enjoy Patterson's previous books I don't think you'll be disappointed here either.	2001-01-03

Knowing he has excellent writer-genes I wondered what he would come up with. Within the first chapter I was hooked. The characters are vivid full techni-color souls with their own set of demons and secrets.   What makes this book so real is that everyone has been tormented by classmates however, Christopher Rice takes what can be perceived as harmless schoolhood traumas and exploits them into full blown tragedy. The tale begins with four friends practicing their own set of rituals however, Rice hints at the onset of something bigger running through the quad.  The beginning felt like &quot;The Body&quot; by Stephen King but this tale soon blossomed into a mixture of VC Andrews weirdness. While you will not find vampires or witches in this novel... there are many subtle nuances to keep you guessing.<br />I look forward to reading more work by Christopher Rice. His style is straight forward and flavorful at the same time. His character development is intriguing and very complex.  If you're looking for a good read this is a good avenue to wander down.	2000-11-21

I recall the first time I read the Godfather and the resounding feelings of honor and the undercurrent of love and commitment that I was struck with. Sure there are the scenes everyone remembers (horse heads in your bed) but the love of family was the theme that stood out to me in the first Godfather book. <br />Puzo has done it again.  With the third and final installment of the Godfather trilogy we are introduced to the inner workings of the Aprile family. Puzo's magical ability to enrapture the reader into the underworld does not hit short in his final book. Here is a  conflict between the Family and the legitimate business world... a world not known for it's overwhelming display of honor where everyone is a sell out. As with Puzos other Godfather books the lines between good and evil are blurred.  Family honor, Omerta, justice all intermingles with each characters sense of right and wrong and plays with the readers own beliefs of the two.  A more developed characterization of the other Aprile clan would have made for an even richer tale... however, Mario Puzo will be well remembered with this final work.	2000-10-19

I believe if you are looking for an  inspirational read and if you are a non-tree hugger like me you will find  this book interesting (not bogged down with facts, figures and verb-age).  If you are looking for something intellectual you may hunger for something  with more substance.	2000-08-28

Being of Korean decent I am always drawn to Korean  books. This is one of the most enjoyable books I've read yet. The symbolism  and depth of character continues to haunt me after finishing the book last  month.  Cleo is the older sister who lives life boldly... Marcy whom the  story is told by is the exact opposite of Cleo. I most enjoyed the  interactions between Marcy and Cleo's two children. The story is funny and  quick moving... I could not put it down.  I believe the depiction of two  women struggling between being Korean and American at the same time (first  generational korean that is) was beautifully conveyed to the reader. It's  hard to go wrong with this winner!	2000-08-09

However, I am not only disappointed but offended by this novel of  fiction.  First of all I found it interesting that no dates were given. I  do not know how old MS. Kim is however I know that Harry and Bertha Holt  began the first international adoption out of Korea in the 1950's after the  Korean War. These were landmark adoptions and very public.  Also, there is  no such thing as &quot;Honor Killings&quot; in Korea while they do take  place in other countries. I find it difficult to believe that Ms. Kim was  able to retell such events with such detail as they would have occured  while she was below the age of 5.  Having worked in the field of child  abuse I know for a fact that children do not comprehend times of trama with  such detail and adult reasoning. I find it even more unlikely due to the  fact she was relying on her memories only (lack of another person to  discuss the details with). Having a Romanian brother who is struggling with  learning English I believe it impossible for Ms.Kim to have learned English  in less then a week...let alone comprehension.<br />I am saddened that America  is being led to believe this story. As a work of fiction it is at the best  a plea for empathy. However, I fear it does more damage to us, adopted  Koreans by continuing the misunderstandings of our culture and our  experiences. I urge you to over-look the facade of drama and concentrait on  what you know about human development... you don't have to take my word for  it... listen to your own gut... I'm sorry Ms. Kim but your details have too  many loop holes and untruths for me to buy it. Unfortunatly I already  bought the book.	2000-08-07
US	53024614	R1OCP1EDT03TAR	0060928549	616125621	Selected Poems	Books	4	14	14	N	N	and the beat goes on... and the beat goes on...	There are several books out there filled with Ginsbergs ponderings (I've looked at most of them)... so why pick this one?  For one... this collection spans 48 years of A. Ginsberg's work. Highlighting poetry that  the author selected personally. Sure here you will find the ever famous  &quot;Howl&quot;, &quot;Sunflower Sutra&quot; and &quot;America&quot; as  well as, &quot;Elegy for Neal Cassady&quot; which was written by Ginsberg  shortly after hearing of his long time friend's death. However, where many  of these sort of books highlight one particular phase the author has gone  through (like a gallery showing of only Picasso's blue phase) this tome  lets the reader experience the entire Ginsberg.  I highly suggest this book  for anyone who is interested in getting to know Ginsberg and in  experiencing his greatness which spanned over 48 years (longer then his  friend Kerouac was on the planet).	1999-12-13

And once in a while one comes around that touches my soul...this one I must admit I could not put down. The characters are beyond powerful... and I credit Billie Letts for loaning them to us. Benny Goodluck with his rich heritage, Moses  Whitecotton whos wisdom I could taste and feel, and Forney whos eccentric  nature captivated instead of isolated me. I will carry these characters  with me for many days I suspect. May I find individuals in my life who  enrich me as Novalee's did.	1999-12-03

A GOOD Read Even For Non-Golfer	I bought this book for a friend of mine. And in a weak moment (no books to read in the house) I picked A Good Walk Spoiled up. I had anticipated being bored to death... as I am not a golfer and pretty much golf illiterate.  What I found was a whole new world I had been missing... and honestly  confused by. I have many golfing friends and I never understood what the  fascination was all about. From the time Feinstein described Davis Love's  urge to throw up in the first few pages... I was hooked and not due to my  attraction to regurgitation. The actual angst these guys put themselves  through was amazing to read about. Their home lives and what inspired them  to live on the road 40 some weeks out of the year in search of that elusive  hole in one made me appreciate the sport in a new way. 500 pages later I  was surprised not only that I had hung in there but also that I throughly  enjoyed the experience. I contribute my positive trip into golf land to Mr.  Feinsteins clever turn o'phrase.	1999-12-03

I loved  how her writing would suck me in time and time again. She had a talent of  making me care about her characters and even shed a few tears for them. I  feel incredibly insulted by &quot;The Klone and I&quot; What I have read  from other reviews is that others who are fans of her's feel the same. The  individuals who have liked it perhaps aren't great fans of hers. I feel she  used her good name to con her readers into buying this book.  When you are  an author of Steel's caliber you are expected to produce a certain type of  quality writing. If you want to try something new... fine... that's what  they make pseudonyms for. Obviously she didn't feel this book could make it  on it's own.  And it couldn't! Perhaps a vacation is in order... get it  together Danielle!	1998-08-24

However, I am adding this one to my all time favorite list. The  characters suck you in and won't let go. I found that I couldn't put this  one down. It's been a long time since I've had a book touch me this much.  It brought back what it felt like to be young and in love. It also reminded  me of those friends who touch your soul and change you forever. It  addresses the reality of friendship through good and bad times and reminds  us that friendship is often bittersweet with many facets.  I found this  book funny and tragic and wonderful... You must try this one out!	1998-08-24

Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil was a delight to experience. In Berendt's Savannah I found a mix of Gatsby-ish characters (Joe Odom and Jim Williams), colorful dragqueens (look out Ru-Paul and Pricilla... Lady Chablis is here...yeasss) and don't forget the witch doctor, shaman, guru Minerva. This was a story of diverse people living in a ridged society and doing very well. It showed that society will adapt to all types of individuals and still have the audacity to be pretentious. It also shows that old money and new money do not truely mix and that the times of society being two-faced is not an extinct phenomena.  Do yourself a favor and step into Savannah as Berendt sees it. Don't act like an uptight northerner or an uppity visitor but ease into the town and look around and most of all enjoy.	1998-01-01

I lucked on to Patterson a few years ago and have been wrapped up in a love/hate relationship ever since. Love because he makes my heart pound with fear and suspense and hate because he leaves me hanging with the lights on and a bad  case of insomnia.  Cat &amp; Mouse is just as good as it's prequels!  I was blown apart in the middle when I was manipulated into thinking tradgedy struck (No I'm not going to tell you what happend... read it yourself!).  Patterson's Alex Cross series will lighten your heart with it's warm characters and scare you to death with it's psychosis.  If you haven't read any of his books do yourself a favor and begin at the beginning. And if you are a fan as I am then buck up and dig into this great thriller!	1997-12-25

To keep his lover's attention he must compete with the pool boy who has youth on his side and at the same time find a job.  (The last time he was on the job market he was 15 and ran a cash box).

It is a story about sacrifice and family loyalty.  A story about a true &quot;prodigal son&quot; and the woman who loves him.  The book is much better then the movie!  It show the intense love of a son who wanted nothing to do with the family business but then ends up saving it and himself.  It tells about the strength of these organizations.  It also has a wonderful ending.  Puzo's Last Don is also wonderful.  And the Sicilian is about Michael (the lead in the Godfather) however I found it boring and much lacking	1997-05-03

My teacher at the time told me to read the last chapters first and then read the book like normal.  Well, where was he for this book?  I recommend reading the last few chapters first and then go beginning to end.  I was truly disappointed by this book!  The end took such a crazy...never in your life would you have guessed it twist that I felt cheated!  I missed several important clues during my reading of the book because I didn't see their significance until the end and it was too late.  I felt it was an ok book but would have been greatly enhanced if I had known what was at the end.  I do not think reading the last few chapters will ruin the book but enhance it	1997-05-03
