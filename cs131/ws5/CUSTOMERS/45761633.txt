I recently reviewed another book from Reader's Digest entitled \\"Discovering the Wonders of Our World\\" in which the earth's natural wonders were described in excellent fashion. Reader's Digest have now come up with a similar theme although, on this occasion, they have also included man-made monuments in addition to a chapter about such legends as Camelot and Atlantis.<br /><br />Let me be quite clear; this is an excellent work in it's own right and would ordinarily easily attract a 5-star rating.  Being published only one year after that other title, however, I was surprised and disappointed to see several examples where the same subject matter (Grand Canyon, Meteor Crater, Giants Causeway, Great Barrier Reef, Mount Fuji - to name but 5!) is repeated here - though not copied verbatim. This took the edge off the book for me - and with it one star.<br /><br />Nevertheless, when viewed on it's own, the book is well worth the purchase price.  With 6 general headings under each of which are several chapters, we have the subjects of; Incredible Earth (which includes 16 sites of natural wonder), Monumental Wonders (24 outstanding examples of historic architecture), Watery Worlds (13 examples of seas, waterways and even Blue Holes), Riddles and Symbols (13 of the world's mysterious carvings on the earth's surface), Timeless Landscapes (13 examples of an extension of the first section!) and Legendary Realms (7 examples including Eden and El Dorado).<br /><br />Each of these 6 new sections is introduced by a single, often quite excellent, photograph which is reproduced across two pages. Unfortunately, these 6 specific photographs are not captioned - and I still don't know what that incredible structure across pages 250/1 is.  Almost another star lost there!<br /><br />NM	2005-03-27

Perhaps, if you could afford to go anywhere on earth for your holidays, you might consider buying a copy of this book.  Then you could spend the rest of your life's vacations visiting the 52 most outstanding natural wonders that the earth is able to provide.<br /><br />My only disappointment was with trying to marry the word \\"Atlas\\" in the book's title with the content.  By it's very definition, any Atlas is a book of maps or charts and this is the first time I have ever picked up anything claiming to be an Atlas where there are \\"NO\\" maps whatsoever. Not one.  Secondly, the 52 chosen sites are put together in no apparent order - logical or otherwise.  For example, in successive chapters we visit Ayers Rock in Australia, Mount Fuji in Japan and then it's all the way back to Australia for the Great Barrier Reef.  More preferable would have been to depict each of the sites in question as a number shown on a map of the world - and then to visit each of those numbers in turn as though it were a single journey.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is still a first class book which - but for a slight lacking in organisation, could so easily have scored a full 5 stars.  The content is still there, the outstanding photographs are still there and so are the facts surrounding an incredible selection of places.<br /><br />NM	2005-03-27

Although this book was first published in Russia some 40 years ago, this the first English translation.  Written by a distinguished former Soviet submariner, it is a moving, vivid and first-hand account of life in the submarine service of the USSR during the bleak years of WW2.  The author died in 1993.<br /><br />Greatly feared by the Germans, I found it fascinating to learn how they employed extensive counter-measures to ensure the entire Soviet Fleet was kept bottled up.  In this way German U-Boats were then able to strike at allied and even neutral shipping with impunity.  Then we learn how, in 1943, all that began to change as the Allies learned how to strike back at their, hitherto unseen, enemy.<br /><br />For those with an interest in the war at sea, it is very easy to become so preoccupied with U-Boats and the North Atlantic campaign that the struggles undergone by our Soviet Allies (as they were at that time) are completely overlooked.  The involvement of Finnish Forces on the side of Germany (Finland eventually withdrew from the War in 1944) was an additional threat of which I previously knew very little.<br /><br />Altogether a fascinating, well written and worthwhile book which, for me at least, has opened up a whole new area of interest in the war at sea during 1939-1945.<br /><br />NM	2005-03-27

Many books which document any television programme or series are often lacking an important ingredient if the reader failed to see what was broadcast prior to reading the resultant book.  Not so in this case.  Whilst the book will undoubtedly leave the reader wishing they \\"had\\" seen the programme, this book stands well on it's own as a most readable and enjoyable tome.<br /><br />Kingdom of the Ice Bear is - as the title perfectly suggests, a book about that area of the earth which is inhabited by Polar Bears.  For those who are not aware, Penguins are found in Antarctica and elsewhere in the southern hemisphere only.  Polar Bear are found in Arctic climes only. And, if I may just put the size of the Polar Bear into context, when standing upright on it's hind legs, a fully gown male Polar Bear will reach a height of over 12 feet (very nearly 4m!).<br /><br />As the reader will expect, the central theme to the book returns to the Polar Bar time and again - but only because it has digressed in order to include just about everything there is to include in such a barren and yet beautiful landscape; The Inuit, Musk Oxen, Arctic Fox, Snowy Owl, Beluga Whale, Harp Seal (to name but some!) are all covered and their lifestyles reported alongside the flora and fauna which somehow seem to make the region far less desolate already.<br /><br />This is a book about a region where the Polar Bear lives.  It is an excellent book and comes highly recommended.<br /><br />NM	2005-03-27

I have always wanted to travel to the foothills of the Himalayas and must, therefore, admit to a little envy of those who have. Of course, there are plenty who have made the trip in one way or another and, seemingly, even more who have then gone on to write instantly unforgettable books about such adventures.  Thankfully this one is worth reading - if not more than once.<br /><br />In this case, the author's self-imposed task was to travel by Yak through Nepal and Tibet to the ancient forbidden city of Llasa.  Accompanied by a photographer called Caroline and two Yaks - called Mucker and Sod, this is the story of their journey.  It was an epic adventure punctuated by humour, danger and not a little Chinese bureaucracy. So, if you have ever fancied a trip to the foothills of the greatest mountain range in the world - have a read.  You will be glad you did.<br /><br />NM	2005-03-09

It could be said that the very pride of Americans in their country was born on the day Commander Robert E. Peary discovered the North Pole in 1909. Sadly, Peary's own secretive style and his refusal to submit his logbooks for scrutiny allowed doubts to overshadow that monumental achievement. For seventy five years those private logbooks remained locked away from public gaze and, as is always the case with those who achieve greatness, others who are unable to rise to such heights are only too willing to chip away at any well-deserved reputation until there is nothing of the meal left on which to feast.<br /><br />Then, 80 years later, renowned polar explorer Wally Herbert was given permission to study those previously unseen logbooks and private letters and, based on his own 30 plus years of exploring the arctic, could question the great Peary at his leisure. Throughout the following years of research in which he sought the answers to the most demanding questions, Wally Herbert reached a much needed conclusion as to exactly what Peary did or did not achieve. In order to reach that final determination, Herbert had peeled away Peary's very façade to reveal him as an ordinary man with ordinary frailties. It is always, however, the ordinary man who is able to achieve greatness.<br /><br />In putting together his research and findings into this excellent and most readable book, Herbert has provided the reader with an historic account greater than any work of fiction.<br /><br />NM	2005-03-03

Once again we find a book under the general heading of photography where the title seeks to make a very big claim.  Achieving photographic style is as difficult for the photographer as trying to define what precisely is meant by that very term is for the writer. In this fascinating book by one accomplished photographer, we are treated to the works of numerous other accomplished photographers - most of whom are not household names.<br /><br />In a book which is very thoughtfully laid out and presented, we find how successful photographers have found that certain measure of style in a situation where other photographers were also present and failed. It is always the successful photograph - and, thereby, the photographer, who is remembered.  From people involved in confrontational and even warlike situations, to the peace and solitude of an outstanding landscape or a subject of still life, this is a book which should be studied by all photographers - if only because there is an image in there somewhere which will give you an immediate idea.<br /><br />Ideas are what photography is all about and this book is packed full of them.<br /><br />NM	2005-03-03

Although designed to accompany a major BBC television series, this book stands alone as the complete story of the development of the submarine from those early ingenious devices to the latest in nuclear powered technology. All the great names associated with the pioneering work of submarine design are here - including Bushnell, Fulton, Holland and Z&eacute;d&eacute;.  Even William Bourne gets a mention and he first described such a craft in a publication called \\"Inventions & Devices\\" as early as 1578!<br /><br />Those early submarines are all well covered - complete with their successes and failures.  This includes their use in times of war from the American Civil War through the two world wars of the 20th Century and latterly varies from the German U-Boat to the two man torpedoes and X-Craft of WW2.  Curious how the German U-Boat of WW2 went on to become the basis for all the world's modern submarines. Eventually the book brings us right up to date with the story of those unmanned submersibles of the type use by Dr Ballard to find the Titanic.<br /><br />In short, just about all you ever wanted to know really.<br /><br />NM	2005-03-02

Similarly, when I see a book which claims to be a \\"complete\\" guide to whatever, I do not expect to find large sections of the subject matter missing.  Thankfully, in this case, the book is a fairly complete guide to the overall subject of Nature Photography.<br /><br />This includes a section on high speed photography with inclusion of some outstanding examples of birds, butterflies and insects all in mid flight, photographed by that world-famous exponent of this particular aspect of photography - Stephen Dalton.  Similarly, there is also a section on underwater photography - although, I did find the photographs here to be rather bland, uninspiring and some were even out-of-focus.

Once again we see the word \\"Encyclopedia\\" used in the title of a book which is not an encyclopedia at all. For a book to be so called, the contents must be laid out in alphabetical order.

This is not so with this book and, for that reason, the title given to this work is very misleading.<br /><br />That said, this is an otherwise competent and reasonably comprehensive work. It is a large format book containing just over 200 pages of intimate information on many aspects of photography including techniques and equipment. After a personal introduction by the author, the next 18 pages are dedicated to the story of photography which is condensed to a mere 4 pages with the next 14 devoted to a single photograph from and a few notes about 14 of the world's outstanding photographers. Then it's back to those good old subjects of; Basic principles, essential skills, visual themes, projects, studio & darkroom, applied photography, problem solving and galleries - almost all of which are covered elsewhere, if not in books by this particular author, then in books by others.<br /><br />Difficult to categorise this particular work.<br /><br />NM	2005-02-25

Commencing by giving the reader a clear demonstration of how British high-ranking officers failed to recognise the value of the submarine as a weapon of war immediately after WW1, this author skilfully devotes his first chapter to the development of the submarine in the Royal Navy up to the outbreak of WW2. With the original design of the 'U' class coming along in 1934, the scene is carefully set for an interesting book. And interesting it is too!<br /><br />By the end of WW2 seventy two 'U' Class submarines had been commissioned of which 17 were lost to enemy action and three to accidents.  The officers and men serving in those vessels received no fewer than 375 gallantry medals including those of Lt. Commander M. D. Wanklyn VC, DSO (and 2 Bars) DSC, RN. (NB: for those who are not aware, when a British medal is earned for the second time, a bar is issued to the original award - thus Wanklyn had three DSO's).<br /><br />In a well written and highly informative text supported by 35 b&w photos and a number of line drawings, this is just about as complete a work on any particular class of naval vessel I have come across.  The author has even managed to bring the book right up to date by including details of the discovery of the remains of HMS Umpire in 1989 (including an artist's impression of the wreck) and HMS Vandal in 2003 by scuba divers. In so doing we also have the benefit of knowing the most probably cause of their accidental losses in 1941 and 1943 respectively.<br /><br />NM	2005-02-20

Whenever I am not underwater, I am often found photographing birds in which I have achieved some modest success.  This book is packed with pictures of the highest quality I have ever seen in any book which is \\"not\\" about photography.  Whether they are standing, perched or even in mid-flight, the pictures are just stunning. The reason I have deducted one star, however, is because the photographers who took these excellent pictures are not named in the book. Sadly, all we learn is that the photographs came from a particular picture library.  Simply not good enough!<br /><br />High quality photography is very important when it comes to determining the difference between birds of different species. I still can't tell the House Sparrow from the Tree Sparrow or the Song Thrush from the Mistle Thrush and it is books like this which both explain and demonstrate those differences by setting such high standards not only in photography but also elsewhere.<br /><br />So what have we got?  A high quality book which describes just about all there is to be described in terms of ornithology; The birds around us, how birds work, behaviour, binoculars, photography, keeping notes, bird-watching in towns, inland waterways, the seashore, cultivated areas, forests, mountains and so forth.  Altogether an excellent book for the amateur ornithologist who really does want to learn more about his hobby.<br /><br />NM	2005-02-20

HMS Faulknor was one of many British Destroyers during WW2. This, however, was the one ship which was given task after arduous task until she earned the sobriquet of being the hardest worked Destroyer in the entire fleet.<br /><br />A quick glance at the 47 books listed as written by this same author reveals how this is a writer who specialises in books about war - both in the air and at sea.  It is also fair to say that those who have held the highest office in HM Forces (Mountbatten, Lord Fraser, Lord Lewin to name but three) would not consider lightly adding a foreword  under their own, illustrious name. It is, therefore, a measure of Peter Smith's ability to fully research any particular story and put together an account which is both compelling and factually correct that many such eminent names have been only too willing to appear in his previous books.<br /><br />This is the third edition of a book which first appeared in 1967 and which now benefits from the free access to material that was hitherto restricted. It is, therefore, a much fuller and richer account of this splendid ship, the actions in which she took part and of those who served on board.<br /><br />My one single criticism is retained for the photographic captions which need to be tidied up before the book is reprinted - as I am sure it will be.  That, however, should not be allowed to spoil your enjoyment of this otherwise excellent work.<br /><br />NM	2005-02-19

At the same time he simultaneously explores the development of strategy from the long-established broadside to the ever increasing size of turrets and their guns.<br /><br />Explaining the significance of specific ships to particular nations and the bloody battles they fought, this is clearly an author who understand his subject thus making this a book of great interest for anyone with a fascination of this period of ships and war at sea.<br /><br />NM	2005-02-18

This book was first published in 1977 under a different title and, in 1979, provided me with almost all the background information I required in order to plan an advanced diving expedition to visit the remains of these two great ships off the Malaysian coast. In the event that expedition never took place but, in later years, I made the mistake of lending that book to someone with the same idea. It is a measure of how outstanding this book \\"is\\" that I still regret having made that loan - simply because it was never returned.<br /><br />Three days after the infamous events of Pearl Harbour on 7 December 1941, HMS Prince of Wales (a 2 year old 35,000 ton Battleship) and HMS Repulse (a 25 year old Battlecruiser of 26,500 tons) with 4 Destroyer escorts sallied forth from Singapore as \\"Force Z\\" without air support. Their Aircraft Carrier HMS Indomitable had run aground outside Kingston Harbour a short time before sailing to join and had to proceed to the USA for repairs to her hull. With the events of Pearl Harbour not yet analysed and understood - i.e. airpower vs. sea power, Force Z was still thought to be more than a match for anything the Japanese might throw at them.<br /><br />They were very wrong and when the attacks did commence it was all over rather quickly.

Before settling down to read this book, I began by glancing through the pages to see what sort of warship might be regarded as the world's worst.  The inclusion of the \\"K\\" class submarine did not surprise me but the Yamato, Graf Spee and Hood - I thought these were the outstanding Battleships of their day.  Then, having read the narrative for each vessel, it became quite clear why they are included.<br /><br />\\"The World's Worst Warships\\" is a hard-back book measuring 10\\" x 8\\" containing almost 200 pages of detailed information on a carefully chosen selection of warship types.  Commencing with the Monitors of the American Civil War, the Author brings us through his book - chapter-by-chapter and development-by-development, as this particular type of war machine evolves and improves.  Each chapter becomes a fascinating read and the book is well illustrated with a generous selection of line drawings and historic photographs.  Incidentally, all illustrations are courtesy of \\"Chrysalis Images.\\" Chrysalis Books are the parent publishing company and I suspect many readers will find some of the images to be new and previously unpublished.<br /><br />At the beginning of the book, it is very easy for the reader to mock the early efforts of those building the very first iron-clads - the benefits of hindsight and all that.  Later on, however, we can only stand in awe as we learn of the political thinking and sheer dogmatism that surrounded the design of this and the building of that.  To think that the one country which truly recognised the value of the Aircraft Carrier right at the outbreak of WW2 would also insist on building 2 Yamato class Battleships - the construction of which almost bankrupted the nation and also even deprived the country's fishermen of their nets.  It's all in there.<br /><br />This is a work of reference to interest ship's historians the world over.  I also suspect it will be much sought after by Scuba Divers who look for the reasons why this wreck or that wreck is where it is today.<br /><br />NMhat wreck is where it is today.<br /><br />NM	2005-01-26

This title of this books proudly claims it to be a guide to warships of WW2.  When we get to the content, however, I thought it must be aimed at the younger generation - but no.  The book clearly states \\"This lavishly illustrated book is an essential addition to any naval book collection, both for the naval historian and layman alike.\\"  Somehow I don't think so.<br /><br />It did not take me long to read the book and right at the end I came across the Jervis Bay wrongly listed as \\"HMS\\" Jervis Bay. That was not all.  Under her specifications, against both Dimensions and Machinery is the single word \\"unavailable.\\"  Are they trying to assert that more than 50 years after WW2 ended, the dimensions and machinery of this pre-war liner are still secret?  Just to make sure I turned to my trusty \\"DODAS\\" published in 1969 to find the answers.<br /><br />This book has a number of headings for different types of ship - Aircraft Carrier, Battleships and so forth.  Under heading we then find a small number of vessels listed with each ship displayed across two facing pages.  Most of the available space is taken up with some excellent artwork which, in most cases, show a profile and deck view of the ship in question.  Of course, running the pictures across the centre of the book means that a lot of detail is lost in the crease between the two pages - especially for ships such as Aircraft Carrier which always had a great deal of detail in the middle of the ship.  What little text there is amounts to an overview of each ship or class of ship.  These together with the limited specifications leave a lot to be desired.<br /><br />Two stars retained for the artwork but really not worth buying.<br /><br />NM	2005-01-26

Firstly, we have the narrative of these historic encounters put together in an easy-to-read style that brings much satisfaction to the reader. Secondly, we have a first rate selection of photographs to support those actions that took place after photography had been invented. Thirdly, and perhaps most impressively, the author has gone to great lengths to track down some of the world's greatest paintings in addition to cartoons and maps showing the various deployments for each of the subject battles.<br /><br />Altogether, Mr Ortzen has produced a book of great quality here and it is difficult to see how any reader could be disappointed with the content.<br /><br />NM	2005-01-25

With exceptionally fine artwork, an excellent selection of historic photographs and absolutely first rate cutaway drawings to grace every page, this is one of the best books about German Aircraft of WW2 I have seen.<br /><br />Concentrating on 15 German Aircraft of the period, we have the very best dialogue and illustrations of the very best aircraft that Germany had to offer during this period of world conflict. The artwork in this book is simply outstanding.  Firstly there those cutaway drawings - the type that shows all the internal workings of the aircraft as though the outer skin had been peeled off.  Then there are the artist's impressions of each plane - including side, front and above elevations.  In some cases there are additional profiles showing the different liveries of different squadrons.  Finally there are the historic photographs - which are so good, some look as though they might have been taken yesterday. On the text side we are treated to full specifications and a potted history of each aircraft.  What more could you ask for - only more of the same I suppose.<br /><br />An outstanding book by any standards.<br /><br />NM	2005-01-25

The 373 U-boats which saw service in WW1 accounted for 6,394 merchant ships with a combined tonnage of  over 11 million tonnes. In addition they sank 100 enemy warships - including 10 Battleships. By comparison, the 1,169 U-Boats operating during WW2 sank 2,840 merchant ships with a combined tonnage of over 14 million tonnes and 149 enemy warship including 7 Aircraft Carriers.  And those are just the opening comments from this excellent book.<br /><br />From the earliest German submersible craft built in 1850 to the 12 vessels which are still in service with the modern Bundesmarine, this book will tell you almost everything you ever wanted to know about the German submarine. With plans, drawings and photographs, the U-Boats are listed in alpha-numeric order with all the technical information relevant to the specific vessel.  These details are followed by the fate of each craft.<br /><br />As a junior officer, Dr M&ouml;ller served briefly on both the Tirpitz and a type XXI U-boat during WW2 and is one of Germany's leading authorities on the subject of the U-Boat.

There is no comparable record of the war at sea - especially the U-Boat war at sea, if only because no similar collection of photographs exist.  The author, who was not a submariner, was ordered to join the crew of a U-Boat and to bring back photographs for propaganda purposes. Very soon he became appalled by what he saw and, using his unlimited stocks of film, began to photograph everything around him. Eventually he secreted away over 5,000 photographs until the war was over.<br /><br />More than 200 of those photographs are reproduced here as Buchheim takes us on a journey that is no joy-ride.  Instead it is a blow by blow account of the lives of men inside their tin coffins who's only real orders were to kill or be killed. It is an incredible account of war inside a U-Boat and an excellent read.<br /><br />NM	2005-01-16

For most people any one of the three separate adventures to; The Galapagos Islands, Lake Titicaca or the Blue Holes of Belize and the Bahamas would have been sufficient for a book in it's own right.  With Jacques Cousteau, however, this is just another day at the office and once he has made the points he wishes to impart - it's always time to move on.<br /><br />When my own second book \\"Diving Belize\\" was being written I had occasion to write to Jacques Cousteau with a number of questions.  His personal reply is now framed and hangs on my study wall. It says much about this great man that he found time for such a personal reply.<br /><br />Very few of those who visit the Galapagos Islands have any understanding of the special factors that exist there - factors that must always be conserved. What Cousteau has to say has not diminished with the passage of time. As far as Lake Titicaca goes, few divers get to visit there anyway and the message from this section of the book is probably the only appraisal of diving this high altitude lake. Of course, Belize and the Bahamas are very popular with scuba divers - but I wonder how many of those visitors know exactly what they are looking at when they first set eyes on those underwater stalactites at depths of over 50m (165 feet).<br /><br />I remember returning from one such dive when one of our group let it be known he was very disappointed with the dive.  When it was explained to him that it was impossible for stalactites to form in water and exactly how they had been created - then bent!, and then continued to form, he couldn't wait to get back into the water to take another look. This time he was not disappointed. I have also had the privilege of diving inside Ben's Cave in the Bahamas and the same comment applies.<br /><br />Having been required to re-read this series of books for this (and other) book reviews, I am finding them all the more interesting because of the time which has elapsed since I read them last. In short, these books are timeless and I repeat my view that no scuba diver's bookshelf is complete without a copy of this and those other books in the same series. - but be quick, they will not remain available forever.<br /><br />NMt.

This book was first published in the English language in 1971 as the second in a series of several books - each with it's own specific topic. Some of the photographs may look a little jaded - by today's standards, but because this book would have attracted a 5 star rating in 1971 I believe it should still attract that same rating today.<br /><br />\\"Life & Death in a Coral Sea\\" may be something of an over-dramatic title for some.  After all, this is not a book about Sharks or tragedy - but about conservation, pollution and, above all, the protection of our world's underwater environment.<br /><br />Packed with page after page covering all aspects of the book's main theme, I found the book all the more interesting because of the long passage of time since I read it last.  My over-riding conclusion is that the content is as relevant today as it ever was.

If any modern enthusiastic scuba diver had experienced just one of the many diving adventures recounted in this book - they would be dining out on that story for the rest of their life. Incredible as it may seem, however, each and every one of these outstanding diving adventures happened to one man. His name was Albert Falco and his occupation was Chief Diver on board the ship Calypso under the overall command of Jacques Cousteau.<br /><br />Of course, this book was first published in 1976 and by the late 1980's Falco had risen to become Captain of Calypso - which only goes to prove that this book contains perhaps little more than half the story of this man's life and work.<br /><br />Albert Falco is one of the greatest divers ever to have lived and this book tells the story of many of his greatest achievements. Though never a man to seek \\"records\\" there are numerous instances where Falco was indeed the very first diver to accomplish several achievements.<br /><br />Altogether, this is a gripping account of a man who made it his business to know everything there was to know about scuba diving. The resultant tale of his life is quite extraordinary. I do believe every scuba diver should read this book - at least once.<br /><br />NM	2005-01-13

The foreword of this book is written by a most distinguished former Director of the British National Maritime Museum.  Part of that foreword reads as follows:<br /><br />\\"The history of ships is a vast subject, extending for over five thousand years..... and to cover it fully is a daunting challenge. The knowledge needed is encyclopaedic and calls not only for an awareness of every stage of the development of the ship, from the age of the Pharaohs to that of the nuclear submarine, but also for a detailed understanding of the changes in man's lifestyle and habitat that have led to each new maritime advance. The author must supplement the expertise of the naval architect with the scholarship of the historian.  Additionally, and this is of the utmost importance, no man can truly evaluate or write convincingly of ships unless he is himself a seaman.  And finally, the author must be somebody of vision and imagination who can explain a subject of immense complexity in words the reader can understand, and do this so powerfully that the story, as it unfolds, becomes difficult to lay down. The success of this book, the best of it's kind that I know, stems from the fact that in it's author all these requirements are superbly, perhaps uniquely, combined.\\"<br /><br />Personally, I think this particular foreword is probably the best review any book ever had.<br /><br />This is a large coffee-table book of over 300 pages packed with information in the form of easy-to-read text, photographs - of the ancient and modern, and graphics of the highest standard. Together they combine to do justice to the book's own very daunting title and in so doing we have a most excellent product.<br /><br />NM	2005-01-13

There is no doubt that the Skeleton Coast of Namibia is bleak and inhospitable.  There was a time when Mariners would fear this particular stretch of coastline - and with good reason.  Those who's ships ran aground here had little chance of surviving the savage shoreline and those who were fortunate enough to come ashore had little chance of rescue. All they would find on the landward side was a bleached desert waste with few examples of the African wildlife they might otherwise expect to encounter.<br /><br />Today, of course, we have a wider appreciation of such unspoilt areas and the entire region is now a designated and protected National Park where none may enter without a permit.<br /><br />Such is the tranquillity of this forbidding region that even something as generally accepted as tyre tracks across the hardened sands are regarded as pollution.  Such tracks may take over 100 years to disappear altogether.<br /><br />In this book, the author produces an excellent insight into what appears to be every aspect of the Skeleton Coast. Geology, climate, rivers, flora and fauna, early explorers, shipwrecks, lost aircraft, fortune hunters and much more besides - they are all explained here. It is an excellent book, easy to read and supported by some first rate photography.<br /><br />Of course, it is the shipwrecks which are my own main interest but I should also like to visit such a bleak and unspoilt place. Were I to do so, however, it would not remain so unspoilt. It is, therefore, one of those places I shall continue to put off visiting.  In the meantime, I shall console myself by reading this book again.<br /><br />NM	2005-01-11

Not only does the author (who happens to be German) make totally unnecessary (and very unprofessional!) side-swipes at the British Royal Navy in a book about the US Navy, but when it come down to specific ships I found the information sadly lacking. In one instance, for example, the \\"Service History\\" of one vessel was a mere 17 words. Not enough.<br /><br />In another instance we are advised to read certain magazine articles written by the author to compliment what appears in this book. The fact that those articles were in the German language and, therefore, published in Germany leaves me somewhat perplexed.<br /><br />These publishers are a leading authority on books about Ships and Shipping and I felt let down by this book. Nevertheless, it is a useful list of most (though not all!) types of US Aircraft Carrier and in many ways I can see how it could well be a good place to start that all-important research.<br /><br />NM	2005-01-11

Then you just get annoyed because of the wasted money.<br /><br />Well, this book is not a waste of money simply because it is exactly what it says in the title - A complete guide to every species of Bear. And what a guide it is too.  Just as soon as the book arrived I sat down to glance through the pages.  I like to get a feel for every book I am about to review and I need to see what the format and photography is like before I settle down to some serious reading.<br /><br />The first thing that caught my eye was the list of contributors.  18 of the 32 names were Doctors and all of them eminent in the field of Bears, Zoology and other related aspects.  Then there are the photographs - every one of which is of a \\"National Geographic\\" standard.

But they're the sort of people who think whales are just big fish.<br /><br />For those who are confused, the Bahamas are in the Atlantic Ocean and Florida is in the Gulf of Mexico.

If you like \\"technical\\" it's here but if you like \\"technical made easy to understand\\" - it's also here.<br /><br />Whilst I could have done without that photo of the diver hugging the Shark (picky, picky I know), this still remains an altogether excellent book and almost the only one you will need on your next trip south.<br /><br />NM	2005-01-04

Beginning with a chapter headed \\"Evolution of the Aircraft Carrier,\\" the author successfully explains the early days of aircraft at sea and the problems encountered in providing them with a mobile, floating base from which to operate - and return. With sections devoted to explaining flight-deck geometry, the catapult, landing systems and hangars, this provides an essential lead-in to the information that is to follow.<br /><br />Chapter 2 gives the reader an insight into the changing \\"Role\\" of the Aircraft Carrier. This is a journey from those early days of \\"spotter planes\\" - required to do no more than report the whereabouts of enemy ships, right through to the ultimate modern-day, mobile nuclear powered system for delivering offensive airborne weapons to any corner of the world's seas.<br /><br />With the right amount of graphs, ships' profiles, technical and historical information, this book is a scholarly piece of work. It was particularly interesting to see how the speed of carrier-borne aircraft has improved from less than 100 mph in 1915 to over 1,500 mph in 1972 and how the ratio of capital ships to aircraft carriers had completely reversed over a similar period. Further changes and modifications due to the advent of the British designed Sea Harrier are also covered in great detail.<br /><br />Surprisingly, few countries (14 in all) appear to have ever employed Aircraft Carriers in their fleets and the remainder of the book gives full details of these countries and their ships in alphabetical order. Here one discovers how such historic ships as HMS Warrior built by Harland & Wolff and launched 20 May 1944 and HMS Vengeance (Swan Hunter - 23 February 1944) were renamed Independencia and Minas Gerais when they eventually became the pride of the Argentinean and Brazilian navies respectively.<br /><br />The plentiful supply of historical photographs throughout the book are particularly well chosen. These include everything from the earliest attempts at launching aircraft from warships prior to WW1, the only known picture of the Japanese Shinano - displacing a massive 64,800 tons and lost in November 1944 prior to completion, and examples of every type of Carrier right up to the mighty nuclear powered USS Nimitz class and much more besides.<br /><br />In short, this book contains everything you are ever likely to want to know about Aircraft Carriers and I congratulate both the author and publishers for a job well done.<br /><br />NMt the book are particularly well chosen.

The description at the beginning of \\"Growing mountains, living myths, migrating people,\\" summarizes this book perfectly.  It is all in here, the peoples and the places who and which occupy the roof of the world.<br /><br />The authors begin with an easy-to-follow description of how the mountains came into being as the earth's crust began to cool.  We are then carefully - and very skilfully taken on a journey which includes every known aspect Himalayan life. We are introduced to animals that cannot survive below 20,000 feet above sea level, we are introduced to individual societies and ways of life that are difficult to understand by most \\"westerners.\\"<br /><br />Throughout the book's 286 pages packed with information, we are also treated to hundreds of high quality photographs which, without words, also reveal the way in which these incredible people live and work.<br /><br />In summary, everything you need to know about the Himalayas and nothing to disappoint anyone.<br /><br />NM	2004-12-28

Man has been shipwrecked ever since he first went to sea in some form of rude craft and this book tells the reader all about it. Yes, the Titanic is in here - and if ever a famous shipwreck is used in books where it does not belong the Titanic \\"is\\" that ship.  BUT!, for once, she actually belongs in this book as part of world folklore on shipwrecks.<br /><br />This is an outsize book in which the author has carefully provided the reader with photographs and illustrations of both the ancient and modern. From early Egyptian and Greek vessels right through to the damage caused by the modern super-tanker, we have a history of ships through the eyes of those that were wrecked.<br /><br />Some excellent paintings, graphics and photography make this a first class book which will be of interest to all those with an interest in ships - especially those that were lost.<br /><br />NM	2004-12-26

If ever you have considered visiting Antarctica - for whatever reasons, this is the one book which will answer those questions which we, until now, unanswered.<br /><br />It says much for this work - which is described as a voyage of images and reflections by four explorers and photographers, that the final copyright of the book itself is shown as belonging to the Smithsonian Institute. A sign of quality in itself. It would be easy to describe those images as \\"Outstanding\\" or \\"Stunning\\" - and so they are, but those words are too frequently used for lesser photographs.<br /><br />This is a book which explains the Antarctic in a way in which it has not been explained before. It does so with an excellent mix of text and photography which, as I have said, answers those questions that until now remained unanswered.<br /><br />If all you want is to know something about Antarctica - then stop and pick up this book.

It came as no surprise to discover that none of the world's greatest rives are found in Britain. In fact Old Father Thames is hardly likely to make the top fifty! The end-papers of this book depict a map of the world in grey and white outline onto which each of the world's greatest rivers are shown in black. This is a clear and simple way of showing the reader exactly where those rivers are and how long they are in comparison to each other.<br /><br />From the contents page we find they are covered in the order: Yangtze, Volga, Irrawaddy, Mississippi, Loire, Zaire, Danube, Amazon, Nile, Zambezi and Ganges. Each chapter is written by a different contributor with the overall content having been edited by Alexander Frater who also supplies the text for the Irrawaddy.<br /><br />This book might be easily likened to a book of short stories by different authors. This is because each river has a very different tale to tell and is populated by very different people - and sometimes creatures.<br /><br />With each chapter being adequately supported by a collection of colour photographs - which are found together either in the middle of the text or at the end, we have a reasonable account of the world's greatest 11 rivers put together in a format which is easy to follow.<br /><br />A useful addition to the bookshelf.<br /><br />NM	2004-12-23

From those romantic subjects such as a Grey Squirrel in mid leap right down to a plant which is overrun by Greenfly and Aphids, Stephen Dalton is the man who seems to be able to take the right photograph just at the right time.<br /><br />As a natural history photography myself, I thought I was already aware of most of the wildlife which exists in my garden. In this book, however, this author shows me how to look beyond those obvious subjects such as animals, birds and flowers (although these too are also included to great effect) and discover much more besides. Only in a book by Stephen Dalton do we get to look at the way in which leaves from different trees fall together to make uniquely coloured patterns, or the way in which the early morning dew reveals the cobwebs of money spiders, or the way in which fungus - yes fungus!, radiates out from an old sawn log.<br /><br />This is a book for anyone with an interest in their own garden.  Once read, you will never look at that garden in the same way ever again.  It is also a book for those of us who wish we could take natural history photographs - half as good.<br /><br />NM	2004-12-22

One of my most prized possessions is a personal letter from the late, great Jacques Yves Cousteau which is framed and hangs on the wall of my study.  This is the man who brought the undersea world into the living rooms of so many people all over the world. Those television programmes first began in the 1950's and yet, even today, people talk about them as though they went out only yesterday.<br /><br />Not only did this man pioneer the invention and development of the Aqualung, he also pioneered the development of underwater photography.  It was to be expected, therefore, that any book bearing his name would be the most complete and thorough account of the subject and that the photography would simply be the best.  It is.<br /><br />Jacques Cousteau's Whales is a large coffee table book containing 280 pages of sheer value for money. The content includes Whaling in all it's bloody detail, a description of each species, their plight today, their migratory, mating and eating habits and much, much more besides. There are historic references throughout the book where appropriate.  Numerous ancient and historic pictures and photographs appear alongside modern photography which detail every aspect of the Whale. As with all good photographs, many of the images speak volumes; Across pages 10 and 11, for example is a photograph of a few Seagulls above a sea turned bright red by Whaling.<br /><br />For many people, this will be the only book on the subject of Whales the will require and they will not be disappointed.<br /><br />NM	2004-12-15

In this book, Andrew Cleave uses the word Giant just as one might describe Shakespeare as a giant of literature. It is a large, coffee table book packed with one of the most outstanding collections of colour photographs ever assembled into a single book.<br /><br />The introduction takes us back to the early years of fishing, whaling and exploration at sea. It includes semi-mythical encounters with Whales, Giant Squid and other sea serpents as it describes the experiences and folklore of yesterday. Unlike the remainder of the book, the text here is printed in very large letters which is unnecessary.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it is an interesting start to what now becomes an enthralling journey through the seas of the world. A quick glance at the contents page reveals exactly what we are in for with chapters headed; The Coral Reef, Whales & Dolphins, Sea Mammals, Sharks, Skates & Rays, Giant Fish and finally Marine Turtles.<br /><br />Each of these sections is hugely informative and will give any reader a wider understanding of the sea's creatures. I was particularly pleased to see an objective and educational overview of the Shark - especially the Great White Shark, without all the hysteria that always seems to attract any discussion of this specific topic.<br /><br />Altogether, a first rate book.<br /><br />NM	2004-12-14

When it comes to artwork, I have always admired that which is so accurate it could almost be a photograph - emphasis on \\"almost.\\" The shipwreck paintings in Bob Ballard's books are a good example of this. When it comes to wildlife - especially African wildlife, however, I can think of no artist in the entire world other than David Shepherd who can make his subjects come to life on a piece of canvass. He does the same with portraits, landscapes, aircraft, famous ships and glorious steam engines. One of his paintings of British paratroopers in action (Suez 1956) hangs in the Officers' Mess of 3rd Battalion the Parachute Regiment.<br /><br />There is, therefore, far more to David Shepherd's work than just the elephants for which he has become particularly famous. In addition, he has such a passion for the subjects he paints that he founded the \\"David Shepherd Conservation Foundation\\" through which he has channelled enormous funds towards helping and protecting endangered species of the world. How often do we find him on radio and television as he continually draws attention to this subject and that plight.<br /><br />\\"Painting with David Shepherd\\" is not any old \\"how to\\" book. This is a book where one of Britain's most popular and successful artists shares his secrets in order to help other artists with their work. Whilst those who know something about this man may well have expected to find a picture of one of his Elephant paintings on the front cover, be assured, this is not all about wildlife. After an informative introduction in which he suggests the reader be prepared to completely re-think their traditional approaches to oil painting, we find sections on; Materials & methods, sketchbook, wildlife, landscapes, trains, boats & planes, the past and portraits. I particularly liked the way in which he draws the readers attention to incidental detail - all of which goes towards the production of a great work of art.<br /><br />In short, there is something in this book for every artist - be they well established or simply aspiring.

Speaking as a scuba diver with over 40 years experience, I well remember the first time I ever saw a shark underwater (Fiji 1979) - and can feel the excitement as though it were only yesterday. I had no desire to harm that creature then and have no such desire now. Instead I look to works such as this to further enhance my understanding of the creature.<br /><br />On the one hand, this is a very good book with much information for the reader. On the other, it is as though the book has been hijacked by Ron and Valerie Taylor just to further publicise their existence. I am aware that many divers really dislike their gung-ho, macho style of attacking the shark head-on for reasons of personal publicity, but let me make two points; Firstly, the book is billed as having an “Introduction by Ron & Valerie Taylor.” Surely that means “they” didn't actually write it. At the beginning, there is a list of 8 contributors in addition to the Taylors and a photograph of all but one of these ‘nine.’ Of course, the Taylors’ just “had” to pose looking through the jaws of a Great White Shark in order to extract maximum personal effect. But what message are they trying to convey?<br /><br />Elsewhere we find photographs of Valerie Taylor wearing a chainmail suit covered in raw fish trying to get a Shark to bite her arm - I always thought it a great pity she didn’t try that stunt using a helmet - but I digress!!! And again, just what is that supposed to mean? Is she really trying to teach the uninitiated that sharks eat raw fish?<br /><br />All of which begs the question; Is this a serious book or what? Judging by the qualifications of the ‘serious’ contributors (some of which are very impressive - and none of which are held by the Taylors’!), I think it is. It would, however, have been much better with just the input from those other 8 (qualified!) people. Why? Because they are experts a person can take seriously. Put another way, with all reference to the Taylors' removed, this would easily have been a 5 Star publication.<br /><br />Today, all species of Shark are becoming increasingly endangered - some critically so. I wonder how much Ron and Valerie Taylor have contributed to the overall decline of this creature in general and the Great White in particular. Perhaps they haven't - but their antics suggest otherwise and many people believe them to have done far more harm than good. If so, that is not something for which they can be proud - with or without that wretched chainmail suit and their penchant for posing through the jaws of a Great White…<br /><br />Thankfully, the days of huge safaris to shoot wildlife in Africa and the Tiger in Bengal are long-gone. How long do we have to wait until the antics of those who persecute great creatures from the deep also come to an end?<br /><br />NMrs' removed, this would easily have been a 5 Star publication.<br /><br />Today, all species of Shark are becoming increasingly endangered - some critically so.

Commencing with a \\"Natural History of the Reef,\\" we are skilfully taken on \\"A Journey through the Coral World during which time we will have sampled just about everything a coral reef has to offer. Add to this the author's own outstanding photography and some diagrams of the highest standard and we have - in this one book, as complete a picture of the Coral Reef as I have ever seen.<br /><br />I particularly liked the way in which they have approached one of the Appendices at the end which is entitled \\"A Diver's Guide to Coral Reef Fish.\\" No they have not tried to include a picture of every single species. Instead they have provided the reader with an outline of each family of fishes. In this way, any diver who has seen some species with which he is not familiar will be able to look up the general outline of that fish - thus narrowing the search for formal identification.<br /><br />Altogether another excellent book from Jeremy Stafford-Deitsch.<br /><br />NM	2004-12-10

The wreck of the German WW1 Cruiser SMS Emden is still found perched on top of the rocks exactly where she ran aground off North Keeling Island in 1914. What was not destroyed by enemy action, Japanese salvage in the 1950's and almost a century of pounding by the elements, still bears a remarkable resemblance to a once great ship and is a lasting testament to her once gallant crew.<br /><br />Under the command of one of the most chivalrous men ever to wear a uniform, this ship went in pursuit of enemy merchant vessels and was amongst the most successful ever to do so.  In one raid she sank a Russian cruiser and French torpedo boat after simply steaming into a British port and opening fire.<br /><br />Such were the exploits of this ship and of the way in which her captain and crew conducted themselves, any person of any nationality would like to think that the personnel in their own navy were capable of emulating such fine behaviour - both in success and defeat, as was displayed in this particularly fine example.<br /><br />The book itself is well laid out with an interesting selection of historic photographs and maps.

In 1942, these two ships were in company with a fleet of smaller vessels at Brest. The original idea was that these two Battlecruisers would one day form part of a much greater fleet alongside the Bismarck and Tirpitz so that, together, they could destroy the Royal Navy at sea, it was a dream that never materialised.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the life and times of these once great ships is a compelling story and one that is well told by this author.

Just as soon as I start to research any ship lost at sea I head for one of two books.  If the date in question is before 1963 I head straight for this book - which is (or should be!) the first point of reference for anyone on such a quest.<br /><br />Laid out in an encyclopaedic form, the ships are covered in strict alphabetical order.  There are no photographs or drawings - just facts about those ships. Each of these commences with a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the technical details followed by a brief account of the loss of the vessel itself. In some cases, this narrative is nothing more than a few lines comprising all the available information. In the case of other, often more famous, losses the narrative runs to a number of pages.<br /><br />Because this is a book published by Lloyd's of London, the ships listed are predominately those which were insured by Lloyd's at the time of their loss. Other ships which were either uninsured or simply insured with another agency are not, therefore, included. Many people find this either confusing or disappointing. Whilst it would be nice to have a single tome detailing \\"all\\" the shipping losses in all the world, that was never the objective of this excellent book and is probably impossible to achieve in any event.<br /><br />Altogether an excellent record of the overall subject for which 5 stars are not enough.<br /><br />NM.	2004-11-30

It may not be a well known fact that the Merchant Navy suffered a greater loss of manpower - in terms of the percentage of their overall strength, than any of the three military services during WW2. Of the 185,000 seamen who served, 30,000 were lost along with 2,000 ships. These men provided a \\"Life Line\\" for the islands of Great Britain and Northern Ireland which were under constant siege from enemy aircraft, ships and submarines. Without the supplies they brought to our shores, Britain would have capitulated.<br /><br />In this book, Peter Elphick recounts many of the stories which have become legendary amongst seafarers and is a true tribute to all those who served - whether they survived or not.<br /><br />I consider this book as essential reading for all of those with an interest in the sea and her ships.  More importantly, however, it should be read by all those scuba divers who have a passion for collecting relics from sunken ships.  Many of those ships were lost as a result of enemy action and this book will go a long way to explaining the price already paid in providing any diver with a collectable maritime artefact.<br /><br />NM	2004-11-25

Horses and the Royal Family are as inseparable as Laurel and Hardy and this book sets out to bring that relationship right up to date by concentrating on the present Monarch's relationship with the noblest of animals.<br /><br />After a short introduction, the book is divided into a series of chapters which cover every aspect of Her Majesty's horses - both personal, sporting and ceremonial. Beginning with her very first pony which was a gift from her Grandfather - King George V, we are treated to a family scrapbook of photographs of the young Princess Elizabeth and other members of the Royal Family which take the reader to 1949.  On becoming Queen on the death of her father in 1952, the next chapter explains the Royal Mews, state occasions, various carriages and the functions on which they are used whilst expertly covering the early years of Her Majesty's reign.<br /><br />Chapter 3 is devoted to \\"The Turf\\" and describes the Queen's love of horse racing and show jumping. This provides an excellent lead-in to the next Chapter which is entitled \\"The Royal Windsor Horse Show\\" where we are treated to examples of some of the horses which serve Her Majesty as part of the British Army.  It is here that we find those glorious Drum Horses of the Household Cavalry - which, for all their size are steered by the knees of the Drummer as he uses both hand to set the tempo for whatever musical display is at hand.<br /><br />The penultimate chapter is devoted to the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery, where we learn of the origins of this, the most senior \\"Troop\\" in the British Army. This history is then complimented with personal tales which describe the dangers involved in moving a horse-drawn gun carriage at speed.<br /><br />Finally, we come to the ceremonial aspect of Her Majesty's position as Head of State - covering everything from Trooping the Colour to riding in Windsor Great Park with a visiting US President - Ronald Reagan in 1982.<br /><br />Lavishly illustrated with plenty of photographs relevant to the text, this is a book from which everyone with an interest in Her Majesty and all her Horses will learn something of great interest.<br /><br />NM.<br /><br />British Army Major (Retired).ed with plenty of photographs relevant to the text, this is a book from which everyone with an interest in Her Majesty and all her Horses will learn something of great interest. <br /> <br />NM. <br />British Army Major (Retired). <br /> <br />	2004-11-16

Ten Years and Twenty Days is a direct reference to the 10 years Karl Doenitz spent as a U Boat commander and the 20 days he spent as Hitler's successor as Fuhrer of Germany. I had stated previously in this review that the period related to his time in Spandau jail which was 10 years and I am grateful for being corrected on that point.<br /><br />As an English boy born in 1950 and growing up in a post-war Britain, we would play games where the Germans always lost - just like Cowboys and Indians. Much later in life, I began to research various ships and shipwrecks through my scuba diving and the name of Karl Doenitz came up time and again. Over many years I came to respect this man for the way in which he conducted both himself and his branch of the war with Britain. I consider him to have been an honourable enemy of my country. Yes, he was convicted of War Crimes, but it says much for the respect that this man engendered that over 100 senior Allied Officers expressed their disappointment at his sentence. But then, to the victor go the spoils and the one man to succeed Hitler was never going to remain a free man when others were being executed!<br /><br />Having read so many accounts of this once great Admiral before reading his own memoirs, it is clear to me he was convicted of no more a crime than \\"being one of the enemy\\" and it was for that he served his ten years at Spandau. Others, of course, were directly responsible for the great human atrocities of WW2 and it was they who were either sentenced to death of life imprisonment.<br /><br />I am sure there are those who will disagree with my assessment of this man - and, indeed, their own assessment may be more accurate. Nevertheless, this book reveals a great deal about an honourable man and is one which should be read by all those with an interest in Karl Doenitz the German Naval Officer and Karl Doenitz the last Fuhrer - who's first task on succeeding Hitler was to seek peace.<br /><br />NM<br /><br />An Excellent Account of Hitler's successor.t Account of Hitler's successor.	2004-11-05

Winston Churchill was one of only two people holding ministerial office at the outbreak of both WW1 and WW2.  Whilst he was First Lord of the Admiralty in both cases, he did hold other posts in between. As First Lord, he learned a great deal about the Royal Navy and was extremely well versed in naval matters generally by the time he came to be Prime Minister during the latter of those two wars. It is for this reason alone that he was often accused of paying more attention to the Royal Navy and their operations than he did the Army and RAF and theirs.<br /><br />Stephen Roskill comes to the subject with excellent credentials - having been appointed to the Cabinet Office Historical Section in 1949 to write those volumes of the UK Military History Series eventually published as \\"The War at Sea 1939-45.\\" Having been granted immediate access to the First Lord's and First Sea Lord's papers (the First Lord of the Admiralty being the Government Minister with special responsibility for the Royal Navy and the First Sea Lord of the Admiralty being the senior Royal Navy Admiral (also known as Chief of Naval Staff) who is in charge of the Royal Navy) for the period in question, he undoubtedly had access to information which would have been denied to other writers at that time. Little wonder his work eventually, though incorrectly, became known as the official history of WW2.<br /><br />In \\"Churchill and the Admirals,\\" the author now explores the very relationships Churchill had with a variety of senior RN officers (and others) throughout both wars. Whilst names like Beatty, Jellicoe (WW1), Pound and Mountbatten (WW2) spring readily to mind, what makes this account all the more remarkable is the fact that one man - i.e. Churchill, was involved at the very top of British Naval operations and strategy throughout this most important time in the history of the world.  And!, he almost out-lived them all.<br /><br />NM	2004-10-12

I can't say I have never heard of Gary Gentile, but this is the first and only book I have from this particular author.  To say I was impressed would be an understatement. I live in the UK and whilst I have no plans whatsoever to visit Delaware or Maryland, it is books like this that can make anyone change their plans and simply turn up with all their diving gear.<br /><br />The book is laid out just as a book about the shipwrecks of any given area should be laid out.  Under each vessel's name we have those technical details which divers are seeking more and more these days. Then we are treated (and some of the stories really are a \\"treat\\" to read) to the story of the vessel's final moments.  There are 30 wrecks featured which include an \\"African Queen\\" as well as a \\"Poseidon.\\"  But it is the book itself which is the greatest adventure because the greatest part is that not all the wrecks have been found.  Just as ancient maps of unknown areas carried the words \\"Here be Dragons\\" so this book carried the message \\"Here be virgin wrecks.\\"<br /><br />If I was living on the coast of Delaware or Maryland I would start my next search and research project by reading this book and then visiting all the appropriate museums, libraries and other institutions for further information before getting stuck into some very serious diving.<br /><br />If you have any more of these books Mr Gentile - please let me know.<br /><br />NM	2004-10-12

When you find a book which claims to get down to the \\"Basics\\" of any subject - you should expect to find exactly that. Thankfully, this author understands what that words means and delivers the goods.<br /><br />I am at the stage where my first bird is flying free and is being trained to hunt and, already, I have learned a great deal from this book. Not only is this an excellent book for beginners, I suspect many of those who think they \\"know it all\\" will find some useful information here. The artwork is simple and effective - and it works.

All the different components of such essential items as, for example, the glove, hawking bag, hood, swing lure, creance (to name but five) are shown in the right amount of detail thus creating no confusion whatsoever.<br /><br />The book itself measures 10in x 7½in (255mm x 190mm) and is packed with almost 250 pages of basic information about Falconry. Altogether, the author has covered every aspect of the sport from; The law, various birds, housing, equipment, furniture, handling, weights, food, training, travel, dogs, ferrets, fitness, illness, injury and lots more besides.<br /><br />I would suggest this book is an essential addition to the bookshelf of anyone who keeps birds of prey no matter how experienced the keeper might be.

Shortly after this book was first published, I attended the London Dive Show and I recall how I had to convince the lady selling this particular book to let me purchase her last \\"counter\\" copy because she had sold out within a couple of hours of opening on that first day.<br /><br />This book is a collection of shipwreck and treasure stories from ancient and modern times shown in the context of where they are in the world.  Measuring 12½ in x 10¼ in (315mm x 260mm), it is packed with almost 200 pages of exactly the sort of information every diver wants to read.  In short, this hardback book is a steal at £20.<br /><br />A quick glance at the contents page reveals how the author uses the word world-wide theme of the book to good effect with chapters on; Bronze Age to Byzantium, Vikings, Chinese Junks, Levantine Trade, Portuguese Carracks, Armada, Spanish Plate Fleets, Pirates and Privateers, East Indiamen, Revolution, Great Collectors, Gold Rush, Mail Ships and Liners and ships from WW2. These are followed by carefully detailed Annexes which show; The relevant maps, shipwreck listings, glossary, bibliography, index and acknowledgements.<br /><br />The treasures are enough to make any mouth water - and they are not yet all found.

As with dictionaries and other reference works, nobody sits down to read an encyclopaedia. Instead, I began by carefully studying numerous entries and then put the book to the test by comparing the \\"glossary of terms\\" found in two very good books on Falconry to the content of this work.<br /><br />The book measures 10in x 7¾in (255mm x 195mm) and contains 150 pages packed with information plus an extensive \\"further reading\\" section at the end. The publishers claim 95,000 words defining some 1,500 terms used in connection with the sport of Falconry. Those I had selected to study at random were all well described and included the ancient and historic origins of those words (where applicable) in addition to their meaning. The book also contains numerous illustrations to assist the written descriptions plus 4 sections of colour/black and white photographs/illustrations - from both ancient and modern sources.<br /><br />Thinking I had stumbled across a whole area which had been missed by the author, I looked up a number of medical terms associated with Falconry and was (initially at least) very disappointed to find vitally important words - such as \\"Bumblefoot,\\" missing altogether.  Then I discovered the 8 page appendix on \\"Diseases and Ailments\\" right at the end and mentally offered the author my sincere apologies and quickly restored the book's 5 star rating.<br /><br />Altogether, an excellent book and a most useful reference tool - although I am not sure why they have used the American spelling (i.e. Encyclopaedia instead of Encyclopaedia) in the title. A small matter which should not deter anyone from buying the book.<br /><br />NM	2004-09-27

Having had a passion for Owls since I was a boy, it was only a matter of time (and the right amount of land) before I began keeping them. Initially, I learned a great deal from knowledgeable friends who's support continues. It wasn't long, however, before some of the well-meaning advice from one friend was being contradicted by another and occasionally I needed to consult a more expert source altogether.<br /><br />I had already come across this author's name and a book with the title \\"Understanding Owls\\" seemed exactly what I needed. What a pity that the one message which comes across from this book - Loud and Clear, is that the Owl is not Miss Parry-Jones' favourite bird. In fact, I don't think she likes them at all. Having read the book and certain sections more than once, I am left thinking perhaps it is the author who needs to learn a little \\"understanding.\\"<br /><br />Commencing with a short section on taxonomy and where the Owl fits in to the overall scheme of things, we then find coverage of such subjects as biology, distribution/habitat, diet, feeding, reproduction, survival and status before coming on to the all-important topic of keeping them. It is here that the author tries to deter the would-be keeper by commencing with the subject of \\"Problems\\" and immediately exaggerates the noise owls create. After a page on \\"Giving a Home to Wild Disabled Birds\\" she summarises what she has written so far with the words \\"So what have we got? Owls are noisy, and generally not much fun just to watch in a pen; that leaves us with owls for breeding and flying.\\" (Incidentally, the errors in punctuation and grammar are not mine).<br /><br />So far, her own down-beat attitude towards these magnificent birds makes you wonder why she bothers keeping them at all. Furthermore, you could be forgiven for thinking she was being forced to write this book against her will.<br /><br />All that said, those first 40 pages then prove to be nothing more than a rather poor introduction to what now becomes a fairly useful book. Whilst still encountering the anti-owl sentiment here and there, we are now treated to the well described and illustrated subjects of; Housing, breeding, management, incubation, rearing, training and hunting.<br /><br />Sadly, just as we were beginning to smile, the author returns to a very down-beat message at the end under the heading \\"Hunting.\\" The message here has nothing whatsoever to do with hunting or even what is involved, just a couple of anecdotes about problems experienced by other people coupled with the author's wish to put off the reader at all costs. A bit like \\"I've started (in this way) - so I'll finish (in this way).\\" Which is altogether a great pity because this book could have been so much better.<br /><br />NMul book.

Having read books by other author's (including one called \\"Falconry\\" in which the subject of falconry itself is not even covered!) I needed the right book - and I needed it now.<br /><br />When the  book first arrived it looked as though it might end up being a 4 Star book - but I was wrong. You see, each and every book I review (and I have reviewed several hundred), commences with a full quota of 5 stars. Stars may then be lost for any number of reasons - but they have to be lost through some shortcoming of the book itself. There are no shortcomings here.<br /><br />The book measures 9½in x 6¼in (24cm x 16cm) and contains 150 pages.  It is well laid out, well written and well illustrated.  The subjects range from an introduction to the subject of falconry, getting started, equipment (and it's all in there!), your first bird, care, illnesses, rules of the sport and the law.<br /><br />Not only did I come to the book with a lot of questions, but as I read the book (some sections more than once) I found myself asking yet more questions.  It says much for the competence of this author that all the answers were found - within the book itself.  I have already adopted the author's prescribed method of intruding a Rabbit lure to my bird  - and it's working.<br /><br />In short, I am so delighted with this book that I could not find a single reason to deduct one star.

Who else?, you may rightly ask. Well the answer might so easily become Admiral Sir William Hargood - though only a captain at that time.<br /><br />Defiant and Dismasted at Trafalgar is an apt description of both Hargood and his ship (The Belleisle which was the only British ship to be totally Dismasted by enemy action). It is a hardback book measuring approx 9½in x 6½in and is packed with 190 pages of text with a small collection of relevant (and very interesting) photographs set together in the middle plus a few maps.  The book itself chronicles the Life and Times of Admiral Sir William Hargood. Commencing at the age of 10 when he first went to sea, the author skilfully takes us to each of the important phases of his life as he rises through the ranks of the Royal Navy until his peaceful death at home at the age of 77 years.<br /><br />In command of the Belleisle, Hargood was given a most important role and sailed his ship through withering enemy fire for more than 20 minutes without firing a single shot in return.  When he did \\"come within pistol shot range\\" he opened up with a double broadside crippling enemy vessels to both sides.  Nelson, watching his instructions being followed to the letter aboard the Victory commented \\"Nobly done Hargood\\" and so it was.<br /><br />Mary McGrigor takes the reader through the almost roller-coaster ride of Hargood's life in a very professional and well presented manner. In piecing together the various extracts from what must be thousands of individual sources of information, we are left with a story that is as complete as any latter day account could be.<br /><br />This is a skilful and competent work. As an example, in one moment, as we enter the opening phases of the Battle of Trafalgar, we are treated to a personal account of the battle by a 16 year Royal Marine Lieutenant and at the height of the action we are switched to that of another Royal Marines officer without losing any of the flow of the excitement.<br /><br />Better than any work of fiction, this is an eminently readable book even for those with no interest in naval history.<br /><br />NMyal Marine Lieutenant and at the height of the action we are switched to that of another Royal Marines officer without losing any of the flow of the excitement.<br /><br />Better than any work of fiction, this is an eminently readable book even for those with no interest in naval history.<br /><br />NM	2004-09-24

In using the real number of the vessel on which he actually served he has, for me at least, blurred the lines between fact and fiction.<br /><br />But don't let that comment deter you from a good read.<br /><br />NM	2004-09-24

When reviewing a book about U-Boats some weeks ago, I automatically thought of (and mentioned) Gunther Prien and Otto Kretschmer. There were, of course, many other U-Boat commanders far to numerous to mention here and, for different people with an interest in this particular aspect of WW2, those and other names will come readily to mind.<br /><br />This book is about six very different U-Boat commanders and each account is written by a different author.  Apart from Endrass, I had not heard of the others - and I am certain to be admonished for that in some quarters.  Each chapter tells the complete story of the subject German officer from start to finish. It includes their lives, their backgrounds and, as the title of the book might suggest, their achievements in battle for each of these men was indeed a silent hunter.<br /><br />Jurgen Oesten is a holder of the Knight's Cross and a former commander of U-16, U106 and U-861.  On the back of this book he has written the words \\"As a former member of the same trade and based on my own knowledge, I can say that each of the six authors succeeds in presenting an excellent description of the individual personalities of their subjects, building up a memory that is worth keeping.\\"<br /><br />Some might say this book could be improved by the addition of more historic photographs but I found it contained just the right photograph at the right time.<br /><br />An excellent read and a book which adds a little extra to one's overall knowledge of the U-Boat campaign of WW2.<br /><br />NM	2004-09-24

Graham Moore was regarded as what we would call today a \\"Star Performer\\" as he served aboard HM Frigates between 1793 and 1804. He was present during the Naval Mutiny of 1797 and helped destroy the French Fleet off Ireland the following year. Six years later he captured a Spanish Frigate carrying a fortune in treasure and as commander of HMS Indefatigable was involved in the opening stages of the Trafalgar campaign.<br /><br />This book is based on his private journals written during his time as a Lieutenant through to Captain RN and gives modern historians a valuable insight into the problems associated with turning one of HM Frigates - with it's largely motley crew, into an efficient and effective fighting machine.<br /><br />Tom Wareham was born in Portsmouth, the son of a serving Naval Officer and was, therefore, raised in an environment of Royal Navy culture, practises and traditions.  In 1991 he was awarded a PhD by Exeter University for his research into the activities of the Royal Navy's Frigate commanders during the Great War with France.  He is currently Curator of Docklands Museum, London.<br /><br />Frigate Commander is a hardback book measuring approx 9½in x 6½in and is packed with over 280 pages of text with a small collection of relevant photographs set together in the middle. Beginning in 1784, the author takes the reader on a fascinating journey through Moore's life in which his own extremely readable narrative style is interspersed with direct extract from Moore's journal.<br /><br />Altogether a well written and fascinating insight into life on board a series of Royal Navy ships and the life that went with them at one of the most interesting times in British naval history.<br /><br />NM	2004-09-24

The work of Dr Robert D. Ballard knows no bounds and is truly inspirational to those of us who read of his exploits and seek to emulate his standards with much lesser shipwrecks.<br /><br />Once again, just as soon as I took delivery of \\"The Lost Ships of Guadalcanal\\" I knew I had a 5 Star Book in my hands and, once again, I found nothing within it's 220 pages to make me take away any of those stars.<br /><br />This book will stand the test of time as a literary work and outstanding account of one of the major naval battle zones of the Pacific in WW2. There are modern photographs including a number taken from the air, historic photographs (American, Australian, Japanese and local) of the places, the personalities, the ships, aircraft and soldiers, some incredible paintings of the night actions that took place, pictures of Ballard's crew as they go about their work and his advanced equipment being deployed and used. There is also a picture of a very young John F. Kennedy in his PT-109.<br /><br />The first underwater pictures are enough to make the heart stop for just a moment as you realise this man Ballard has done it again - not once, but in this case several times. Commencing with the 9,850 ton Heavy Cruiser HMAS Canberra (the \\"A\\" stands for Australian) we no sooner see the first underwater photographs of this once magnificent ship - which went down fight in the opening minutes of the Battle of Savo Island, then we turn the page to find a 3-page open-out spread of Ken Marschall's painting of the entire wreck.<br /><br />On the opposite side of that 3 page spread is another equally outstanding painting of USS Quincy followed by her own set of underwater photographs. As the story of Guadalcanal continues, so we find more details of US and Japanese successes and losses and the trials and tribulations endured by the forces of both sides as the author carefully draws us towards that part in the overall series of battles that will bring us to his next discovery and Ken Marschall's next incredible painting - the USS Monssen.<br /><br />With more underwater photographs of yet more of the \\"Lost Ships of Guadalcanal,\\" and yet more paintings by Ken Marschall, the author skilfully brings the reader both to the end of the series of battles and to the end of his own journey of discovery. Whilst not one of the greatest works of art within the book, one of my favourite paintings is found on p.200. This is an aerial picture of the entire area called \\"Iron Bottom Sound\\" - painted as though the water had been removed and showing the location of no fewer than 13 warships, one aircraft and two beached freighters.

We who admire his work and, of course, his books, are much the richer through his sharing of his many adventures with us.<br /><br />Just as soon as I took delivery of \\"Return to Midway\\" I was aware I was a holding a 5 Star Book and there was nothing contained within its 190 pages to make me take away any of those stars. On the contrary, I could so easily have added stars for the factual detail, the readable style of writing, the photography and undoubtedly the artwork. But, in the same way as 5 stars are the most that can be awarded to either a military Generals or an hotel, so 5 stars are the most I could possibly allot to this particular book - and each one is thoroughly well deserved.<br /><br />As the name suggests, this book is about the author's return to Midway - the scene of one of the fiercest naval battles of WW2. In what has become his customary style, Dr Ballard skilfully takes the reader through his own journey towards his eventual goal whilst giving an accurate account of the Battle of Midway itself. In so doing, he treats us to historic facts, memories from some of those who were there (Americans and Japanese), documents, maps, historic photographs and his own photography which are all combined to produce a story which is as complete as it should be.<br /><br />The greatest loss on the US side during the battle was the 19,900 ton Aircraft Carrier USS Yorktown - and Ballard's discovery of this wreck almost 3 miles down on the seabed is as great a discovery as either the Titanic or the Bismarck.<br /><br />Having found this famous and yet elusive ship so deep, the author has again skilfully put together the most complete account of his search, discovery and final success. The various underwater photographs of the ship are then cleverly matched with a description of what the reader is looking at coupled with a photograph of that particular view from when the ship was afloat.<br /><br />As I have said before when reviewing this man's work; As I know from researching and writing about lesser ships, he really has done the most thorough job of work on all fronts.<br /><br />Once again, the book's front cover shows the artwork of Ken Marschall. From thousands of photographic images taken far below the surface, montage after montage of the various sections and profiles of the USS Yorktown were created so that Mr Marschall was able to provide us with a number of paintings which are every bit as accurate as a colour photograph.<br /><br />I congratulate Dr Ballard on yet another excellent and professional job of work. Once again he has succeeded where others only dream.<br /><br />NMbr />As I have said before when reviewing this man's work; As I know from researching and writing about lesser ships, he really has done the most thorough job of work on all fronts.<br /><br />Once again, the book's front cover shows the artwork of Ken Marschall.

Not satisfied with having found the Titanic, this great explorer of Oceans set off in search of what many people believe to be the greatest Battleship ever built - the Bismarck.<br /><br />Whilst we are treated, once again to excellent illustrations by Ken Marschall of the wreck itself, my own favourite series of images are across pages 218/9 and show the Bismarck sinking, how it turned upside down allowing the big guns to fall away from their mountings, how it then turned right side up as it continued it's voyage - 3 miles down, until it came to rest creating a massive underwater landslide. It is because there are no currents down there that that landslide was found - exactly as it was on the day it was created by this great ship in May 1941.<br /><br />Having the achieved yet another outstanding feat of finding a famous - but elusive ship so far beneath the ocean's surface, Dr Ballard has, once again put together the most complete account of that search, discovery and final success.

This book was first published in 1977 under a different title and, in 1979, provided me with almost all the background information I required in order to plan an advanced diving expedition to visit the remains of these two great ships off the Malaysian coast. In the event that expedition never took place but, in later years, I made the mistake of lending that book to someone with the same idea. It is a measure of how outstanding this book \\"is\\" that I still regret having made that loan - simply because it was never returned.<br /><br />Three days after the infamous events of Pearl Harbour on 7 December 1941, HMS Prince of Wales (a 2 year old 35,000 ton Battleship) and HMS Repulse (a 25 year old Battlecruiser of 26,500 tons) with 4 Destroyer escorts sallied forth from Singapore as \\"Force Z\\" without air support.  Their Aircraft Carrier HMS Indomitable had run aground outside Kingston Harbour a short time before sailing to join and had to proceed to the USA for repairs to her hull. With the events of Pearl Harbour not yet analysed and understood - i.e. airpower vs. sea power, Force Z was still thought to be more than a match for anything the Japanese might throw at them.<br /><br />They were very wrong and when the attacks did commence it was all over rather quickly.  Two valuable capital ships were sunk with the loss of 840 lives.  What happened that day has led to many questions being asked about the conduct of those senior naval officers involved.<br /><br />In an overwhelmingly authoritative account, these authors have accessed not only British records from WW2 but also Japanese records from the same period and even those from the naval dockyards of Norfolk, Virginia were the repairs to HMS Indomitable were logged as task No S.139.<br /><br />I am delighted to have a copy of this book back on my bookshelf and if anyone else missed it first time around, now is the time to treat yourself to an excellent account of one of the Royal Navy's greatest wartime disasters which is written in an exciting and compelling way.<br /><br />Better than any work of fiction.<br /><br />NMasters which is written in an exciting and compelling way.   <br /> <br />Better than any work of fiction. <br /> <br />NM <br /> <br />	2004-09-18

Having taken up the sport, there are those decide to specialise in; Teaching, shipwrecks, cave diving, photography, video, technical diving and so forth. In fact, there is no other sport on earth which offers such a diversity of different interests within that single activity.<br /><br />Having learned to dive and having leaned towards a specific aspect, however, there is one single interest which continues to bind all divers together. That interest is the marine life which divers encounter wherever they go.<br /><br />Neither sky divers, pot-holers nor mountaineers get as close to a whole new range of creatures as scuba divers do - on each and every dive. Those creatures may be static (fixed) and yet still classed as animal, they may be free swimming, shy, hard to find or easy to pick up. And, if those creatures are found in the North Atlantic between Canada and New England, they are also found in this book.<br /><br />Marine Life of the North Atlantic is a paper-back book measuring 9\\" x 6\\" (23cm x 15cm) containing 272 pages of solid information on marine life from Algae to the Spiny Lumpsucker fish. Each species is portrayed by colour photography (often more than once) with details of it's Latin name, common name, identification (description) habitat, range and comments. Alongside each photo is also space for the owner of the book to note down each personal sighting and add notes etc.<br /><br />In short, if ever you are diving in the area covered by this book and are interested in what you may see underwater, then this book is an essential addition to your kit bag and is one which will allow you to note each sighting as your diving progresses.<br /><br />Please note, the pages of this book are not waterproof and easily stick together when damp.

It seems that the very mention of the phrase \\"D-Day\\" is always followed by the word \\"landings\\" as, together, they conjure up images of small craft and thousands of allied soldiers struggling to create beachheads on a stretch of French coastline fiercely defended by well-entrenched German soldiers. Whilst those landings signalled the beginning of the end of Nazi Germany, there was so much more besides and this book covers them all to great effect.<br /><br />D-Day, Normandy Revisited is a hard back book measuring approx. 11\\" x 8\\" and containing 190 pages of well researched and equally well presented facts and photographs about one of the most pivotal dates in modern history - 6 June 1944.<br /><br />Five beaches on the coast of Normandy were each given their own code name on being selected for the landing of over 156,000 allied troops. Additional Airborne Forces were also dropped behind enemy lines in order to attack the beach defences from the rear. As each of the 5 beachheads became established so those troops were then able to move inland - fighting running battles in the Normandy countryside as they did so. The book is, therefore, divided into five main sections as it tells the complete story of each of those beaches - Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. In this way the reader is treated to what the publishers aptly describe as a \\"photographic pilgrimage\\" - firstly to the beach in question and then to the towns, villages, farms and even individual buildings relevant to the events which followed the establishment of each separate beachhead.<br /><br />With an easy-to-read style of writing, the author cleverly steers the reader through everything from the first wet footprints to the fierce fighting in the French countryside. With a generous and well-chosen selection of photographs - both modern and historic, we are shown what happened then and what it looks like now - 60 years on. Then, having followed the fortunes of those troops from one beach, we start all over again with another.<br /><br />In many ways this book is a jigsaw containing all the pieces which make up a complete picture of the events which were D-Day. I have read the book and it seems to me that all the pieces are there but, more importantly, it serves as a most appropriate celebration of those key events which, as I have already mentioned, saw the beginning of the end of an evil regime which once dominated mainland Europe.<br /><br />NMmany ways this book is a jigsaw containing all the pieces which make up a complete picture of the events which were D-Day.

Whilst the opportunities to visit any warplane underwater are extreme rare, I have visited hundreds of ships which met their fate at the hands of such aircraft and this book has yet to let me down as I search for the detailed knowledge I seek to complete the entire story of each such shipwreck.<br /><br />Just as there are different makes, models and special editions with the motor cars of yesterday and today, so there were many variants of the different aircraft - not only because those aircraft evolved as they were improved, but also because some were converted to undertake a more specialist role.  For example, there are over 9 pages devoted to just the Heinkel HE111 and all it's variants so, it does seem reasonable to assume all that modifications for the many other aircraft are also all there.<br /><br />As one might expect, the bulk of the book is taken up with Fixed Wing Aircraft (as was the bulk of the German Luftwaffe) after which are sections on Rotary Wing Aircraft (helicopters), Fixed Wing Aircraft Projects and Missiles.  There are sufficient photographs throughout the book to ensure each aircraft is well represented.<br /><br />For many people, I am certain this will be the only book on the is subject they will ever need.<br /><br />NM	2004-08-31

Oh what images the Crimean War evokes and has evoked for 150 years. For myself, with scant knowledge of specific events, I well remember visiting the Officers Mess of the Royal Regiment of Wales some years ago where I stood for over an hour ignoring my hosts just gazing at the detail of the most outstanding piece of regimental silverware I have ever seen.  Made of solid silver, the piece must have measured at least 3 feet by 2 feet and easily over 1 foot high. It depicted in full relief the Battle of Inkerman and showed those attacking and those defending that strategic hill.  It was simply called \\"The Inkerman Piece.\\"<br /><br />Elsewhere, those with a far greater knowledge of the Crimean War have acclaimed this book as a great work. Of course, only those who have studied the subject in great detail can vouch for the accuracy of the content.  Personally, I have taken note of the fact that the Bibliography alone runs to 7 pages and have also taken a close look at the authors and the qualifications and background they bring to the work. In this case it is very impressive.<br /><br />Ian Fletcher was born in London in 1957 and comes to this work as the author of 17 books and editor of several more.  His list of credits is impressive by any standards; Member of the British Commission for Military History, Fellow of the International Napoleonic Society, he also runs battlefield tours specialising in pre-20th century military history and is often found escorting clients to the Iberian Peninsular, Waterloo and the Crimea.<br /><br />Natalia Ishchenko's credits are equally impressive; Born in the Crimea, she graduated from Taurida National V. I. Vernadsky University and obtained he PhD in Philology in 1989. Today she is an assistant professor at her old university and author of over 40 works encompassing literary, historical and cultural studies.<br /><br />In short, these two people know their subject and have formed the perfect partnership for producing such a book.

The first thing that struck me when a copy of this book arrived through my letterbox was how thin it was. As a professional underwater photo-journalist & author who specialises in shipwrecks, I am also a shipwreck historian and, therefore, well aware of the shipwrecks to be found in Bermuda. This book does not do justice to those shipwrecks at all.<br /><br />Bermuda Shipwrecks is a paper-back book measuring 9\\" x 6\\" (23cm x 15 cm) containing 72 pages. With 10 of those pages taken up with such bumf as title of the book (again), fairly ordinary foreword (much of which is repeated on the back cover), acknowledgements, something about the authors, index, how to use the book (which in this case means reading it!) and how to order more copies (as if!), there is precious little room for the details for which we purchased the book in the first place.<br /><br />The book's cover calls this work \\"A vacationing diver's guide to Bermuda's Shipwrecks\\" but it is not even that.  Any diver operating anywhere in the world will require diving information and in a number of cases this is wholly non-existent. In others it is less than two lines.<br /><br />With much of the text punctuated with Teddy did this and then Teddy did that (a reference to Teddy Tucker (who wrote the foreword)) one is left wondering why Teddy didn't do the one thing he should have done - and write the book in the first place.  Doubtless it will be called \\"The Adventures of Teddy!\\"<br /><br />In brief, this is book of short stories about how many of Bermuda's wrecks were lost - and 'lost' is the right word for this book when it comes to detail.<br /><br />Not worth the cover price.<br /><br />NM	2004-08-28

Towards the end of the 19th Century, the world's first great arms race was running a full speed. As either Britain or Germany (the two largest navies in the world at that time) built a big battleship - so the other side would simply design one that was even bigger. This attitude towards supremacy in weapons became infectious and, as far as battleships were concerned, continued right up to 1937 with the design and building of the ultimate Battleship of all time - the Yamato with it's 18.1in guns.<br /><br />Conway Maritime Press are well known for their factual books on ships - especially warships, in which they provide the finest technical documentation. \\"All the World's Battleships - 1906 to Present\\" is hard-back measuring 11¼\\" x 8¾\\" with 190 pages of detailed and factual information. Commencing with Argentina all the world's battleships are listed by country - under which heading they are then displayed by \\"class of ship\\" commencing with the oldest vessels and ending with the latest.  For each class there is one or more of those profile line drawings for which Conway's books have become so well known. These are followed by all the usual technical details such as; Displacement, dimensions, machinery, armour, armament and complement followed by the names of each ship within that class and it's builder, date laid down, date completed and fate.  Next is a very \\"readable\\" potted history from which we learn of any political intrigue, variations between vessels, refits, new equipment, whatever defects or other problems that may have beset either the class or a specific ship and a short r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the fate of each vessel.<br /><br />Finally, the book is well illustrated with an excellent selection of black and white photographs throughout with at least one photograph on almost every page.<br /><br />On reading some of the criticisms voiced in earlier reviews, I would not be put off from buying this book just because a few wretched typographical errors may have crept in (I didn't notice them.). Nor would  be put off just because one or two of the photographs may not be as sharp as we have come to expect in this day and age. Those photographs which are not pin-sharp are included because they are the only photographs which exist and they come from an age when (a) cameras were not widely available, (b) all photography was in black and white and (c) even photography itself was in it's infancy.

Geoffrey Regan is described as \\"Britain's premier authority on military disasters\\" and, with the word \\"Blunders\\" in several of the titles of his previous books, he is certainly well qualified to provide an accurate account of those that are part of the world's naval history.<br /><br />\\"The Brassey's Book of Naval Blunders\\" is a soft cover book measuring 9¾\\" x 7½\\" containing 182 pages of detailed information on various historic naval encounters from around the world. There is a good selection of supporting B&W photographs throughout. In an easy-to-read style of writing - and following a two-page introduction, the author commences with an account of the 18,000 mile journey of the Russian Fleet in 1905 and how two-thirds of that fleet were lost when they finally came up against the Japanese. Likening some of those involved to the Marx Brothers is an apt comparison and a good indication of what is to follow.<br /><br />Part I of the book is then divided in chapters headed \\"Lunatic Admirals\\" - in which we are treated to no fewer than 16 excellent tales to fit that particular heading, \\"Tale of a Tub\\" - 10 instances of ship design ranging from a circular battleship to vessels that torpedoed themselves, \\"The Price of Admiralty\\" - where all the ultimate life-costing decisions are made by the governments and civil-servants-in-uniform of the day, \\"A Life on the Ocean Wave\\" - 6 tales of life aboard ship, \\"Above us the Waves\\" - various tales of submarine design left wanting (including the dreadful K-class) and \\"That Sinking Feeling\\" - recounting the loss of several well known vessels including the Mary Rose and HMS Vanguard.<br /><br />Part II is simply headed \\"Case Studies\\" and is exactly that, the case studies of 22 important naval battles ranging from Drepana in 250 BC to Leyte Gulf in 1944. Whilst I had not previously heard of Drepana - I never realised how Leyte Gulf was such a close-run thing.<br /><br />Altogether, this is a fascinating book, an excellent read and the answer to an awful lot of questions about naval warfare in general, the outcome of several naval engagements in particular and the fate of certain specific ships..<br /><br />NMtions about naval warfare in general, the outcome of several naval engagements in particular and the fate of certain specific ships..

There are those who are quite able to transfer their research into the written word in such a way that the reader is fully able to enjoy the fruits of their work - and there are those who are not.  Thankfully, Bill Finnis belongs to the former group.<br /><br />\\"Captain James Cook - Seaman and Scientist\\" arrived through my letterbox just as I was departing for a week's diving on one of the many Safari Boats found in the Egyptian Red Sea. I always take a good book on such trips and this one proved to be an excellent choice.<br /><br />This is a hardback book measuring approx. 11in x 8¼in, containing almost 250 pages of text with just the right amount of charts, sketches, portraits and photographs in support. The book begins with a chapter headed \\"Setting the Scene\\" and that is precisely what it does. Drawing on his own vast experience of the sea, the author explains the prevailing wind conditions in the Pacific Ocean before reminding us of the contributions made by a host of individuals - many of us will remember from our school days; Magellan, Drake, Anson, Bougainville, Dampier and Cartaret - to name but some.<br /><br />So, having been reminded of what has gone before in terms of world exploration we are now treated to an expos&eacute; of Cook's early years and how he came to be apprenticed to a small shipping company in Whitby on the Yorkshire coast.  Then, after some 4 years - and just as he is offered his very first command of a merchant ship, he elects instead to widen his horizons by joining the Navy.<br /><br />What follows is an immensely readable account of Cook's life and, of course, his death. Along the way, we learn of the difficulties associated with determining longitude and how this led to errors in fixing the precise positions of islands being charted by various explorers. We also learn how William Bligh - later to become that famous Captain Bligh of Mutiny on the Bounty fame, accompanied Cook on his last voyage.  Perhaps, after learning so much about navigation from the great man himself, it was little wonder that Bligh survived that epic voyage in a small open boat after having been evicted from his ship.<br /><br />Elsewhere, we learn how Cook had conducted a detailed survey of the Coast of New Zealand during 1769-1770. I particularly liked the comment whereby, in 1943 US Forces were based in that country and decided the charts should be brought up to date. Their own survey of the New Zealand coastline revealed several apparent errors made by Cook. Some years later, with the benefit of satellite position fixing, it was found that the US Forces were in error and Cook had been right all along.<br /><br />In summary, this book contains 250 pages of historical detail written in a style which makes it hard to put down. It is a fascinating account of one of history's most fascinating men and the reader will not be disappointed by either the content or the way in which it is presented.<br /><br />NMuch about navigation from the great man himself, it was little wonder that Bligh survived that epic voyage in a small open boat after having been evicted from his ship. <br /> <br />Elsewhere, we learn how Cook had conducted a detailed survey of the Coast of New Zealand during 1769-1770.

Such is the legacy of this great ship that, even now - over 60 years after she was sunk, the very mention of the word \\"Bismarck\\" conjures up powerful images of Battleships and war at sea - the like of which will never be seen again.  How curious that nobody ever seems to recall Otto von Bismarck - the former German Chancellor after whom the ship was named.<br /><br />In their \\"Weapons of War\\" series, Spellmount Publishing have produced the full works on this, one of the world's greatest ever Battleships. The Bismarck and her only sister ship Tirpitz were the very best that Germany could produce and, on a one-to-one basis, were easily a match for any ship afloat.  The Bismarck was lost because she was simply overwhelmed and her discovery in recent years by Dr Bob Ballard has only served to renew an interest that was hardly fading in any event.<br /><br />\\"The Bismarck\\" is a hard-back book measuring 11½\\" x 8¾\\" containing almost 100 pages of carefully researched and well- explained information with either historic mages or informative illustrations on every page. Not only was the Bismarck a classic ship, she will remain one of the most famous ships of all time and this is her story from concept to grave.  The book is well illustrated throughout with excellent colour profiles of this and other important ships - all of which form an excellent basis for comparisons.<br /><br />Commencing with the German navy post WW1 and the three pre-dreadnought Battleships she was permitted to retain under the Treaty of Versailles, Hitler's plans for rearmament and the subsequent re-growth of his navy are fully explained with a detailed analysis of existing ships and the lessons learned from Jutland. In this way, the book skilfully examines every aspect of the Bismarck's development and construction with detailed information relating to that historical fact before coming on to her design, machinery, crew, armour and armament. At various points the author digresses from the main theme in order to give a full explanation of that small number of ships which played an important role in the short life of the Bismarck.  Commencing with the Graf Spee and Gneisenau from which we are able to make important technical comparisons, we later find the same level of information relating to the Prinz Eugen and Hood as we move - chapter-by-chapter, through the life of this magnificent vessel. Towards the end is a fascinating account of the Life and death of the Tirpitz before the book concludes with a visit to the wreck of the Bismarck.<br /><br />The colour profiles of each of the main ships are quite excellent and the historic photography includes several images I have never seen before.  I was especially pleased to see a selection of underwater images also included.<br /><br />I congratulate the author and publishers on a job well done.<br /><br />NMtheme in order to give a full explanation of that small number of ships which played an important role in the short life of the Bismarck.

I purchased this book prior to embarking on various Mediterranean assignments in the hope of finding some ready-made research material - perhaps even some new information, on a number of shipwrecks.  Sadly, and not for the first time with this particular publisher, I was immediately disappointed with the book simply because the content completely fails to match the title. Surely, any book describing itself as a \\"Diving Guide to Mediterranean Wrecks\\" should include a reasonably widespread selection of shipwrecks from around the various diving destinations within the Mediterranean Sea?  Unfortunately this book confines itself to a relatively confined area between Marseilles and Sicily.<br /><br />32 dive-sites are covered in varying degrees of thoroughness with 8 being aircraft. 13 wrecks are taken from between Marseilles and Cannes, 3 from Corsica, 10 from along the west coast of Italy, 4 from Sardinia and finally 2 from the Straits of Messina. Prospective buyers should be aware, therefore, that all other established \\"wreck-diving destinations\\" from Gibraltar to Cyprus are not covered at all. That includes 3 of the world's finest shipwrecks; Polyn&eacute;sien, Rosslyn and Zenobia - all of which receive no mention whatsoever.<br /><br />As far as the content is concerned, the wrecks chosen caused me much consternation. Certainly, the Liban, Rubis, Mohawk Deer and Genova are all substantial shipwrecks where the individual narrative reveals a thorough research and knowledge of each vessel.  Elsewhere, however, the Tantine is nothing more than part of the decks of a small tugboat - and definitely not worth a visit to 48m, the Antheor Barges are remnants of small river craft and the Barge of Sestri resembles something like a Thames Barge. These are hardly \\"shipwrecks\\" and I got the impression that they (and others) were included in order to make up numbers and pad out the book.<br /><br />Of the 8 aircraft, there is a half Junkers JU 88 at a depth of 50-53m, a badly damaged Messerschmitt BF 109 at 45m, some three quarters of another small aircraft at 32m, what appears to be nothing more than an aircraft wing at 44m and finally a Vought F4U Corsair at 4m (Yes 12 feet!) - all of which are of little value to the average diver and should never have been included.<br /><br />Altogether, there are far too many instances where \\"Date of Construction Unknown\\" and \\"Date of Sinking Unknown\\" are printed next to the wreck in question and this clearly suggests that far more research was required before this particular book was ready for publication.<br /><br />This series of books are produced by White Star Publishing of Italy and then purchased as a ready made product by other publishers and I reserve my final comments for the translation from the original Italian  - which does become very tiresome to read. For example (and I quote directly from an aircraft wreck - as described on page 91); \\"The fuselage is thus a long empty tunnel rendered interesting by the encrustations of sponges, bryozoa, sea-squirts and annelids which enliven the monochrome aluminium panelling.\\" As I have said before, much is lost in any literal translation from one language to another and White Star Publishing are in  desperate need of a more competent translator.<br /><br />On the \\"Up\\" side, many of the photographs are quite excellent - and for this the book keeps one star, four stars lost, however, for misleading title, lack of research, translation, and choice of sites.<br /><br />NMaged Messerschmitt BF 109 at 45m, some three quarters of another small aircraft at 32m, what appears to be nothing more than an aircraft wing at 44m and finally a Vought F4U Corsair at 4m (Yes 12 feet!) - all of which are of little value to the average diver and should never have been included. <br /> <br />Altogether, there are far too many instances where \\"Date of Construction Unknown\\" and \\"Date of Sinking Unknown\\" are printed next to the wreck in question and this clearly suggests that far more research was required before this particular book was ready for publication. <br /> <br />This series of books are produced by White Star Publishing of Italy and then purchased as a ready made product by other publishers and I reserve my final comments for the translation from the original Italian  - which does become very tiresome to read.

Sadly this book openly shows looting by Divers in contravention of the laws of Egypt. Not only does it show photographs of artefacts illegally removed from a number of Egyptian shipwrecks, but it also goes further by demonstrating the use of a lifting bag - and with it, the removal of yet more artefacts. Worst of all, however, those removed from the \\"Thistlegorm\\" were stolen from an unofficial British War Grave. Four Merchant Seamen and five Royal Navy Sailors died when this ship was bombed and sunk in 1941.<br /><br />Putting these emotive issues to one side, however, one also finds the factual content to be lacking in many areas. This is a great pity because the format had great potential. The book is large format (11½ x 8¼ in.). Each chapter commences with an artist's impression of the entire shipwreck across two pages. No camera can capture such a picture - so we start each dive with a good feel for the entire site. These are followed by technical information, details of each vessel's loss and, of course, diving conditions - all lavishly supported by good quality photographs (for which the book retains it's one star rating).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the actual content completely fails to match such promise. There are 18 featured \\"shipwrecks\\" - one from Jordan, twelve from Egypt, three from Sudan and two from Eritrea. Problems begin with the choice of some of these vessels. Four were not even ships at all - one being Cousteau's long-abandoned undersea habitat \\"Conshelf\\" and another a pile of Amphorae which has long-since disappeared altogether. The remaining two are of vessels which were so small they were never classified as ships.<br /><br />The real problem, however, is one of detail and accuracy. Four of the wrecks are not identified at all, one has a fictitious name, another has a slightly incorrect name and several are confused with each other. All seem to have problems with either identification or technical information. For example, on pages 74 & 75 are two photographs of the bows of the \\"Chrisoula K\\" and two of the stern of the \\"Kimon M\\" - all reported as being the same ship. This is followed by a wreck identified as the \\"Seastar\\" (No shipwreck called \\"Seastar\\" exists.).  This account, however, is based on the \\"Kimon M\\" - which is not mentioned at all, and commences with an artist's impression across pages 77 & 78 clearly showing a relatively intact ship, minus bows, lying squarely on her starboard side. Having, therefore, set the scene with an artist's impression of a ship lying on it's side, we are now treated to actual photographs of the ship - and two of these show the stern to be upright.  So which is it?  Either she is one her side or she is not... On closer examination, however, we find these supporting pictures to be from different ships altogether.  As any diver with a modest knowledge of these shipwrecks will recognise, photographs B & E are from the \\"Kimon M,\\"  C & D are from the \\"Chrisoula K\\" and F is from the \\"Kingston\\" - but in this book they are placed together as this fictitious \\"Seastar!\\"<br /><br />I could go on and on, describing the many problems within this book - but the point is made. In confusing one, two and sometimes three vessels with each other, this book continues to frustrate the many Divers who enjoy their Wreck Diving in Egypt - and has done so ever since it first appeared.<br /><br />Not for the first time, this particular publisher has produced a very low quality product whereby the content appears to have been cobbled together from whatever information and photography was available from different sources.

There was a time when the Battlecruiser Hood was the largest, fastest and most handsome capital ship in the world.  She was also adored by the British public and in many ways came to symbolise everything that was supremely good about the Royal Navy. On 24 May 1941 the Hood was famously sunk by the Bismarck with only three of her crew of 1,419 surviving. It was an act which resulted in Churchill giving the order \\"Sink the Bismarck\\" and, of course, they did. More recently, the remains of HMS Hood have been located at great depth in the North Atlantic resulting in renewed interest in the ship itself. Elsewhere, there are websites dedicated to the vessel and a very strong HMS Hood Association attended by those who had previously served on this, the most beautiful of ships. This is an excellent book for all such interested people.<br /><br />Conway Maritime Press are well known for their \\"Anatomy of the Ship\\" series in which they provide the finest technical documentation for specific ships or ship types ever published. \\"The Battlecruiser Hood\\" is hard-back measuring 10¼\\" (wide) x 9¾\\" with 127 pages of detailed and factual information. This wide format allows the publishers to produce first class detailed line drawings of every aspect of this ship in a size that is easy to see and follow. All the information is there - right down to the last nut and bolt.<br /><br />Laid down in 1916, Hood was designed and constructed when ships got close to the enemy and fired straight at them.  By the time she was completed in 1918, however, battleships were able to lob their shells great distances with alarming accuracy. This new dimension of warfare at sea with shells \\"falling from the sky\\" meant that all warships required armour plating on their decks where previously it had only been on the sides.

Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1922-1946 is the third in a series of 4 books which, as the title suggests, lists all the worlds fighting ships built during the period in question. Initially, these were post-WW1 years in which some countries favoured disarmament whilst others harboured expansionist plans. This was also a time when the Aircraft Carrier would totally eclipse the mighty Battleship as \\"King of the Seas.\\" Eventually, the advent of WW2 and the way in which the USA entered that war added a whole new dimension to warship design and production.<br /><br />Conway Maritime Press are well known for their factual books on ships - especially warships, in which they provide the finest technical documentation. \\"All the World's Fighting Ships 1922-1946\\" is hard-back measuring 12½\\" x 8¾\\" with 456 pages of detailed and factual information. After a brief foreword and an explanation of abbreviations used, the navies of the world are listed by country in order of their size and importance at the beginning of the period in question - i.e. Great Britain and Empire Forces, USA, Japan, Germany, etc and continuing right down to the world's smallest navies from the Middle East, Far East and Latin America. Each country's ships are then displayed by \\"class\\" commencing with the largest capital ships and progressing all the way down to the smallest torpedo boats (or whatever) with the oldest vessels mentioned first. For each class there is one or more of those profile line drawings which have become Conway's trademark. These are followed by all the usual technical details such as; Displacement, dimensions, machinery, armour, armament and complement followed by the names of each ship within that class - it's builder, date laid down, date completed and fate. These are accompanied by a very \\"readable\\" text from which we learn of the political intrigue of the day, variations between vessels, refits, new equipment, whatever defects or other problems beset either the class or a specific ship and a short r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the fate of each vessel.<br /><br />Altogether, the book is well illustrated with an excellent selection of historic black and white original photographs throughout with at least one picture on almost every page.<br /><br />In summary, this is an excellent technical work of reference and one which will continue to stand the test of time.

Gunther Prien had one (U47 - the Snorting Bull), Otto Kretschmer had one (U99 - the Golden Horseshoe) and others too numerous to mention here also had one. What was is they had?  A Type VII U-Boat and both collectively and individually those commanders made this craft one of the most successful submarines of all time. With that success came both fame and notoriety - not only for the dashing and daring captains, but also for the submarine itself. Even today, almost 60 years after the Type VII fired it's last torpedo, there are websites and members' clubs in many different languages dedicated to researching the finest detail of this specific ship and every aspect of the battles they fought. For all those ardent enthusiasts, for all those with a more general interest in World War Two and (speaking as an underwater photo-journalist) for scuba divers the world over, this book is exactly what is required.<br /><br />Conway Maritime Press are well known for their \\"Anatomy of the Ship\\" series in which they provide the finest documentation for specific ships or ship types ever published. \\"The Type VII U-Boat\\" is hard-back measuring 10¼\\" (wide) x 9¾\\" with 95 pages of detailed and factual information. The wide format allows the publishers to produce first class detailed line drawings of every aspect of the ship in a size that is easy to see and follow. All the information is there - right down to the last nut and bolt.<br /><br />Commencing with a potted service history of the Type VII and it's evolution during WW2, we are then treated to a series of \\"Tables\\" which provide us with the technical details of each derivative (i.e. Type VIIA through Type VIIF) followed by similar details for both the torpedoes, deck guns and their mountings. Next is 10 pages of historic photographs followed by 70 pages of detailed line drawings and technical information.<br /><br />And detailed they are too; Under just one main heading \\"General arrangement - external\\" we have drawing after drawing showing every aspect of the 6 variants of this submarine itemising each of the slight changes made as the vessel evolved and improvements in design were made. Not only is the entire hull shown in both elevation, plan and cross-section, there are individual close-ups showing the different bridge layouts and deck gun configurations. Then everything is repeated for the internal features both longitudinally and by cross section - compartment by compartment, including such features as propulsion, steering, control room, engine room and quarters - to name but some.<br /><br />Finally, we have the armament and fittings. With the original boats having one deck gun and later versions having two and with different calibre guns being introduced as the ship was improved, this section covers them all in great detail. This is followed by similar information on the shells fired before coming onto the different torpedoes used throughout WW2. Finishing off with various incidental fittings, this book is complete and I congratulate both the author and publishers for a job well done.<br /><br />NMr drawing showing every aspect of the 6 variants of this submarine itemising each of the slight changes made as the vessel evolved and improvements in design were made.

Before settling down to read this book, I began by glancing through the pages to see what sort of warship might be regarded as the world's worst.  The inclusion of the \\"K\\" class submarine did not surprise me but the Yamato, Graf Spee and Hood - I thought these were the outstanding Battleships of their day.  Then, having read the narrative for each vessel, it became quite clear why they are included.<br /><br />\\"The World's Worst Warships\\" is a hard-back book measuring 10\\" x 8\\" containing almost 200 pages of detailed information on a carefully chosen selection of warship types.  Commencing with the Monitors of the American Civil War, the Author brings us through his book - chapter-by-chapter and development-by-development, as this particular type of war machine evolves and improves.  Each chapter becomes a fascinating read and the book is well illustrated with a generous selection of line drawings and historic photographs.  Incidentally, all illustrations are courtesy of \\"Chrysalis Images.\\" Chrysalis Books are the parent publishing company and I suspect many readers will find some of the images to be new and previously unpublished.<br /><br />At the beginning of the book, it is very easy for the reader to mock the early efforts of those building the very first iron-clads - the benefits of hindsight and all that.  Later on, however, we can only stand in awe as we learn of the political thinking and sheer dogmatism that surrounded the design of this and the building of that.  To think that the one country which truly recognised the value of the Aircraft Carrier right at the outbreak of WW2 would also insist on building 2 Yamato class Battleships - the construction of which almost bankrupted the nation and also even deprived the country's fishermen of their nets.  It's all in there.<br /><br />This is a work of reference to interest ship's historians the world over.  I also suspect it will be much sought after by Scuba Divers who look for the reasons why this wreck or that wreck is where it is today.<br /><br />NMk or that wreck is where it is today. <br /> <br />NM <br /> <br />	2003-05-13

They were nine ordinary freighters armed with torpedo tubes, 5.9in guns and anti-aircraft guns - all of which were concealed from view. With the ability to change their own ship's profile and, therefore, their own apparent identity, these nine were Germany's secret commerce raiders of the high seas during WW2.  They were pirates in the true and historic sense of the word and were even more successful than Germany's best U-Boats. Imagine a disguised freighter with guns hidden behind false panels able to sink an Australian Cruiser with far greater fire power - using nothing more than sheer guile, surprise, and expert gunnery.  To this day, the remains of HMAS Sydney has not been found.<br /><br />\\"Hitler's Secret Pirate Fleet\\" is a hard back book measuring 9½\\" x 6¼\\" containing 200 pages of fascinating information about those nine ships - all of which have a compelling story to tell.  Commencing with the \\"Atlantis\\" - the secret name given to the Goldenfels upon her conversion for such war duties, the author commences the story of this ship at the end - with an exciting and very readable account of her loss at the hands of HMS Devonshire.  In so doing he has skilfully hooked the reader into wanting to know more and, just as soon as the Atlantis disappears beneath the waves, we are treated to her story - right from her launch. It really is fascinating stuff.<br /><br />Covering the; Atlantis, Orion, Widder, Thor, Pinguin, Komet, Kormoran, Michel and Stier - in that order, the author reveals the war time exploits of these vessels in great detail and retains his readable style of writing throughout.  A few map outlines dotted throughout the book help to convey a feeling of where the relevant actions took place.  There is a small selection of photographs in the middle of the book and whilst I would have liked to see more, I do appreciate that 7 of the vessels in question were eventually sunk in action and that, coupled with the very nature of their business, meant that few photographs were ever likely to be available in any event.<br /><br />Altogether, a most competent piece of work and an excellent book for any long journey.<br /><br />NMt few photographs were ever likely to be available in any event. <br /> <br />Altogether, a most competent piece of work and an excellent book for any long journey. <br /> <br />NM  <br /> <br />	2003-03-16

As a scuba diver of almost 30 years experience and something of an expert on \\"shipwrecks,\\" I have visited a small number of Destroyer wrecks over the years.  Just as soon as this book arrived on my desk, therefore, I went straight to one very specific ship that is well known to me.  I found she was portrayed by a photograph I had not seen before and my first reaction was to say to myself \\"so that's what I was looking at.\\"<br /><br />\\"Destroyers of World War Two - An International Encyclopaedia\\" is a large soft-back book measuring 9½\\" x 9½\\" containing over 300 pages packed with solid information about each type of ship laid out country-by-country.  If you want to know anything about a Destroyer from WW2 - then that information is right here.<br /><br />Commencing with an informative introduction in which the author explains the origins of the Destroyer and it's brief history up to the end of WW2, we then find the navies from that period laid out alphabetically from Argentina to Yugoslavia.  Within each of these countries, their Destroyer fleets are then listed by type of vessel with full specifications and an illustration. Each country is then neatly finished off with the details of any ships which were either captured or transferred from elsewhere.<br /><br />This is a work of reference will which stand the test of time.  It is a scholarly work and extremely well illustrated throughout - with at least one image on every page.  Though previously published in 1988, I am sure there will be plenty of people who missed this book first time around and who are now only too pleased of the opportunity to purchase once again.

The book has been carefully laid out so as to portray those events of WW2 featuring the U-Boat in chronological order. With at least one image on every page, we commence with an introductory chapter on the story of U-Boats in WW1.  From here, the author brings us forward - chapter by chapter and event by event to the final reckoning at the end of WW2.<br /><br />As each new development in this aspect of warfare unfolds within the narrative, we are treated to a boxed \\"snapshot\\" of either a type of submarine, aircraft, ship or weapons system relevant to the text. Each of these comprises an example of the excellent artwork of Tony Gibbons/Aerospace Publishing to which is added the salient technical information.  In addition, the impressive collection of historic photographs cover every conceivable aspect of the subject in question.<br /><br />For those with an interest in U-Boat Warfare of WW2, I would suggest this book is an excellent starting point.<br /><br />NM	2003-03-07

Like so many people who have visited Gibraltar over the years, I have had a love affair with this country ever since I first clapped eyes on what is easily the most famous rock in the world.  Whilst my own interest in Gibraltar stems from the superb wreck-diving to be found just offshore, in researching the history of those shipwrecks I found myself drawn into the wider elements of this truly historic piece of real estate time and again.  It was, therefore, with a little knowledge of Gibraltar's history that I sat down to read this book and very soon I found myself saying things like; \\"I've been there\\" and \\"I never knew that.\\"<br /><br />\\"Gibraltar - A History\\" is a large book measuring 11\\" x 8½\\" and is richly illustrated throughout with images of people, places and artefacts which support a well-told story of the history of Gibraltar.  Commencing almost at the beginning of time, the author takes us to AD711 in the very first chapter.  Having thus set the background scenery so expertly, we then travel through time in Gibraltar as we are skilfully brought forward - chapter by chapter and conflict by conflict, to the present day.<br /><br />And, of course, those conflicts are not yet over.  One of the very first lessons I learned over 30 years ago was that Gibraltarians are NOT Spanish people - and never were. Perhaps those who think otherwise should read this book.  They may be surprised - I don't know.  They will certainly be educated.<br /><br />\\"Gibraltar - A History\\" is a book which will stand the test of time because it includes everything you ever wanted to know about this fabulous little country.

The first time ever I saw a cannon underwater was in Northern Ireland in 1976.  At the time, I thought I was looking at something that would have archaeologists jumping to for joy, but it was later dismissed as an old iron demi-culverin of no importance. The following year, however, I was asked to help recover the front 2 feet of a bronze weapon discovered off Gibraltar.  It later turned out that an incoming cannonball had hit this cannon at a time when it was hot from repeated use - thus causing it to break.  Only last year I was visiting St. Paul Island in Nova Scotia where we came across several remnants from early vessels - including cannon and a large pile of cannonballs.<br /><br />It is, therefore, with a little experience (and I do mean \\"little.\\") but plenty of interest in such matters that I took delivery of \\"Galleons and Galleys\\" by John F. Guilmartin - published by Cassell & Co - to be released for general sale on 18 February 2002.<br /><br />Professor John Guilmartin is a leading authority on military and maritime history specialising on the 16th and 17th Centuries.  Whilst many would describe the turn of the 20th Century as a time of revolution in terms of warfare at sea, historians like Guilmartin know how such radical changes happened in an earlier age - albeit on a different scale, at the turn of the 16th Century.<br /><br />Galleons and Galleys is a hardback book measuring 10½in x 8in and packed with over 220 pages of fascinating historical detail essential to anyone with an interest in this period of maritime history.  Beginning with an introduction which explains the age of the Galleon and Galley, Guilmartin then takes the reader on a journey which incorporates Warfare at Sea 1300-1453, Weapons of War 1300-1650, the evolution of European sailing ships - such as the Caravel and Carrack, to the development of the War Galley right through to the heyday of the supreme Galleon.<br /><br />In a thorough and very professional piece of work, the author includes all the peripheral information such as; Warfare at sea before Gunpowder, World Trade and the emergence of major maritime powers, the gunpowder revolution and the development of naval ordnance, the rise of Swedish sea power, strategies and tactics of the day, Anglo-French confrontations and Anglo-Spanish rivalry - thus giving as complete a portrayal of the subject as one could hope to find.<br /><br />With numerous famous paintings and portraits reproduced alongside line drawings of everything from the various types of ship to a description of the mould used for making cannon, this is indeed a scholarly work made all the more important because it is so easy to read and follow.<br /><br />NMe author includes all the peripheral information such as; Warfare at sea before Gunpowder, World Trade and the emergence of major maritime powers, the gunpowder revolution and the development of naval ordnance, the rise of Swedish sea power, strategies and tactics of the day, Anglo-French confrontations and Anglo-Spanish rivalry - thus giving as complete a portrayal of the subject as one could hope to find. <br /> <br />With numerous famous paintings and portraits reproduced alongside line drawings of everything from the various types of ship to a description of the mould used for making cannon, this is indeed a scholarly work made all the more important because it is so easy to read and follow. <br /> <br />NM  <br /> <br />	2002-03-10

Having found the last resting place of the Titanic and Bismarck, it was only a matter of time before someone would find the \\"Hood.\\" This ship was indeed the pride of the Royal Navy and fondly regarded as the most beautiful ship wherever she went.  With her recent discovery, there were bound to be a plethora of books on the subject giving rise to the age-old debate of how and why this magnificent Battle Cruiser sank so quickly.<br /><br />Andrew Norman favours one particular theory for the sinking of the Hood - and I must say, it really is as plausible as any I have read (except for the \\"Built from the same faulty batch of steel as the Titanic\\" theory.).  His description of the \\"Concept of the Immune Zone\\" is easily understandable - and something of which I was previously unaware.  His conclusions that an 8 inch shell from the Prinz Eugen sank the Hood is, therefore, as sound as any.  That said, it is the job of any good author to write his book in such a way as to lead the reader to that same conclusion.<br /><br />HMS Hood - Pride of the Royal Navy is hardback, measuring 9¼ in x 6 in and contains over 150 pages of information and dialogue presented in an easy-to-read style. There is also a liberal sprinkling of very relevant b & w photographs throughout. Altogether, a very competent piece of work, where the author sets the scene by telling us all about the ship through the recollections of a variety of very different people who served on board at different times.  This gives the reader a good \\"feel\\" for the ship before arriving at the events of May 1941 - which are described in even closer detail.  As the jacket  states \\"In these pages you will meet\\" and then lists 5 of those individuals - two of whom had the great fortune to be amongst the three survivors on that fateful day.<br /><br />Doubtless, those who subscribe to a different \\"reason\\" as to why the Hood sank so quickly, will knock this book in order to place their own favoured theory at the top of the pile.  Personally, I don't know because I wasn't there - but I do believe this book should be read alongside all other theories in order to provide a balanced view.

Having previously reviewed other titles in this series with somewhat mixed results I had some idea of what to expect.<br /><br />In addition to learning about the various Dive Sites, the information I require is; Something about the people - a potted history of the country and an insight into their language and customs etc, plus a few lines about shopping, how to get there, airlines, excess baggage, airport tax, tourist boards, hotels, time difference, local transport, currency, electricity, language, photography, diving facilities, safari boats, available equipment, what to bring, what to wear - and so forth. Thankfully, most of these questions (though not all) are answered with additional information on diving for the disabled and Nitrox.  Furthermore, this is a destination with no direct flights from the UK - so the detailed variables of how I might get there were particularly valuable.<br /><br />\\"The Dive Sites of Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao\\" is paperback measuring 9½in x 6½in containing over 170 pages.  Commencing with a two-page explanation of the legends and symbols used throughout the book, we then have chapters on; An overall Introduction to the country, Travel, Diving and Snorkelling in general, Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao, the Marine Environment, Underwater Photography & Video and Health & Safety for Divers.<br /><br />The first map is across pages 10 and 11 and shows the islands (there are actually 5 altogether), in relation to each other and the Caribbean. That and the first 3 chapters are a very good start.  Now we get down to the diving found off each of the 3 main (and two smaller) islands and this is where the book could so easily be improved.  Altogether, there are brief details on 180 dive sites but each chapter commences with \\"Site No 1\\" whereas it would be far more useful had they been numbered consecutively from beginning to end.<br /><br />For each of the islands/island groups, only one map is required in order to demonstrate the approximate position of all the dive sites.  Whilst this is used to good effect as far as Aruba is concerned, Bonaire and Curaçao are separated into 3 and 4 artificial divisions respectively.  When studying the diving detail, it is always the little things which reveal the amount of research undertaken by any author. For many years Aruba has claimed that their shipwreck \\"Antilla\\" is \\"The largest shipwreck in the Caribbean.\\"  Whilst I can't  fault any Tourist Board or local Diving Facility for making such a claim, the Author really should have done his homework.  I know of at least 2 Cruise Liners found elsewhere in the Caribbean (Grenada and Mustique) that are easily 200 feet longer than this particular shipwreck and, for me, the diving detail in this book is, therefore, suspect.<br /><br />My final criticism is reserved for the blatant advertising for \\"Captain Don's Habitat.\\"  This amounts to several photographic captions where no name even needed to be mentioned and a double-page eulogy about this particular diver. I fully appreciate how the Author's diving had to be sponsored by somebody, but subsequent reference to that sponsor should be limited to the acknowledgements page and, perhaps, the occasional plug in one or two (and no more) photographs.  If the Author wishes to write a testimonial to Captain Don Stewart (I am well aware of his contribution to the local Diving scene.) - fine by me, but it's inclusion here gives the impression of this book being limited to the Diving provided by this particular facility - and nobody else. And that is the wrong impression to give.<br /><br />Having said all that, almost all the information you are likely to want is here.  That - coupled with a good cross-section of high-calibre photographs throughout, make this the best diving guide to the ABC Islands I have yet to see.  With a few improvements here and a few deletions there, this book could so easily have obtained a 5 star rating.<br /><br />NMnd a few deletions there, this book could so easily have obtained a 5 star rating. <br /> <br />NM  <br /> <br />	2002-02-01

It is, however, far more than just another collection of photographs of fish, corals and other sea creatures - this is an complete exercise in what to aim for when taking similar photographs.<br /><br />I am studiously avoiding such words as \\"Outstanding\\" or \\"Excellent\\" when describing the pictures contained in this book.  This is because there are many outstanding and excellent photographers out there - but David Doubilet is a cut above the rest and in a class of his own. His photographs need no such description.<br /><br />There is far more to Underwater Photography than taking good photographs underwater and, having studied the many images in this book, I would suggest \\"Light in the Sea\\" is the template on which any aspiring underwater photographer should model their own abilities.<br /><br />Sea Creatures are photographed from every position - with wide-angle lens and with macro-lens, from above the surface, from below the surface - and even from half in and half out of the water.  Islands are shown with rows of coconut trees along the shores in the background and rows of corals underwater in the foreground - and all in a single photograph. Even that well-known rocky promontory in Egypt called Ras Mohammed is photographed from a new and exciting angle.<br /><br />This is a book where every photograph is an abject lesson in photography with each one making the statement; \\"this is what you should aim to achieve when taking a photograph like this.\\"  This is a book where the Master has demonstrated his art to the student and I salute the author.<br /><br />NM<br /> <br />NM  <br /> <br /> <br />	2002-01-31

What followed was 7 years of painstaking work during which he read every single copy of The Times, the Sherbourne and Yeovil Mercury and the Plymouth and Dock Telegraph published between 1793-1815. He also read all the Annual Registers for those same years. This, in itself, was no mean feat and the result is well worth the enormous effort. I congratulate him for a job well done.<br /><br />\\"Shipwrecks of the Revolutionary & Napoleonic Eras\\" is a hardback book measuring 9½in x 6½in and contains 441 pages of vital information (including a ten-page index with which I had no problems!) - all from a new perspective. The appetite is immediately whetted on page 1 where the author reveals the huge scale of British ship losses at this time in our history. Beginning with a chilling quote from a contemporary British historian of 1812 - who stated; \\"perhaps not less than five thousand natives of these islands yearly perish at sea\\", Grocott goes on to show the true scale of ships lost during the years under examination. Whilst, then concentrating on just 1,500 of these (both naval and mercantile), the author demonstrates how they were but a small proportion of overall losses.<br /><br />The figures speak for themselves; During the years 1793-1799 alone, 2,385 British ships were lost at sea with a further 652 driven ashore and only 70 re-floated. At this same time an incredible 4,344 were captured by the enemy with only 705 being recaptured. Thus 3,639 ships were lost to the enemy and 2,967 met a watery grave of some form or other.<br /><br />Having set the overall scene - right at the beginning!, the book then concentrates on 1,500 incidents - involving both naval and merchant vessels. These are listed in chronological form with each account based on contemporary reports. The book gives details of the shipwreck, location and the number of people lost or saved. In addition to major disasters, day-to-day accidents to small harbour boats are also included. This is a book which also provides a very realistic insight into the life of the ordinary seaman of the day and of the perils he faced.<br /><br />Altogether, this is a work that belongs on any serious researcher's bookshelf.

In the UK, most scuba divers know of the Liberty Ship \\"James Eagan Layne\\" which sank in Whitesand Bay near Plymouth on 21 March 1945 after having been torpedoed by U-1195.  Whilst most people are able to recognise a tanker or vehicle ferry, however, for many the term Liberty Ship means nothing at all. Well not any more. This is a excellent book written by a Master Mariner with considerable experience of ships and the sea who has produced a first class piece of work of equal interest to amateur and professional ship historians alike.<br /><br />Liberty Ships were made in the USA during World War Two from prefabricated sections and I was fascinated to learn that the record for building one of these ships was just 4 days. The many shipyards involved combined to provide the Allied Forces with the most positive response to the high rate of shipping losses sustained through enemy action.<br /><br />Measuring 9½\\" x 6½\\", \\"Liberty - The ships that Won the War\\" comprises over 500 pages of mostly text but with a good selection of 26 historic photographs and a most informative exploded-view of how the prefabricated Liberty Ship was designed and built.  Everything and anything you ever wanted to know about this type of ship from conception to watery grave or scrap-yard is here.<br /><br />It was also most interesting to note that the shipbuilding firm of J. L. Thompson of Sunderland provided 3 prototype vessels from which the Liberty Ship eventually evolved. This is the company which also built the Thistlegorm and it is most interesting to see the resemblance between that particular ship and those early prototypes.  Altogether, excellent reference material.<br /><br />NM	2002-01-30

It is a regrettable fact that almost none of the ships from the early to mid 20th Century have been preserved. Apart from a few notable exceptions, from the mightiest Cruise Liners to the lowliest Tramp Steamers, they are all gone forever.  Roger Jordan's work is, therefore, a valuable source of reference into those ships that were operating as part of the world's merchant fleets at the outbreak of WW2 and it is fascinating to see how each vessel fared.  A scholarly piece of work, this book will become the definitive work on this subject.<br /><br />This is a hardback book measuring approx. 12\\" x 8½\\" containing some 630 pages of detail and information.  Beginning with notes explaining the many abbreviations used - including 6½ pages dedicated to the shipbuilders, we then find individual ships listed by country and shipping company in alphabetical order.<br /><br />Over 6,000 ships are described with brief details of; Name, type of machinery, number of screws, passenger-carrying capability, year built, name of builder(s), tonnage and dimensions. Then we come to the section marked \\"Losses\\" - with separate lists for losses through; Marine hazard, war causes, Spanish civil war, vessels scuttled, vessels scuttled post-war with surplus war materials, vessels lost post-war due to mines and those that underwent name-changes. Finally, there is the ever-important index - a straightforward list of all the ships within the book and a reference to the pages where each may be found.<br /><br />With every second or third page containing a small selection of good quality b&w photographs of some of these historic vessels - and in many cases a particularly interesting biography of the ship in question, it is easy to see why this book should be regarded as a comprehensive and definitive work by Roger Jordan and Chatham Publishing. I congratulate them on a job well done.<br /><br />Whilst I did find one small error (picky, picky) - again the Rosalie Moller (my favourite Red Sea dive) is listed as raised and broken up after the war, this I can forgive because this error has already appeared in previous authoritative books.

Jutland again - but a very different approach and an extremely useful tool for those studying the events that led to the loss of ships on both sides.<br /><br />At the end of WW1, there was considerable public disquiet about the outcome of the Battle of Jutland.  This was largely based on ignorance - but, even today, there are those who still think Admiral Jellicoe should have been court-martialled for turning his fleet away from the enemy.  What few people realise, however, is that this was the first major action between two enemy fleets since the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.  During those intervening 111 years, the modern warship had evolved into a gigantic thing of steel with revolving gun turrets.  Tactics, however, had never changed and \\"crossing the enemy's `T'\\" was still enshrined in concrete - as the teaching of the day.  In any scenario whereby two fleets - sailing in line astern, are trying to achieve this advantage, it is also perilously important to ensure the leading ships in one's own fleet are not crossed.  It was, therefore, perfectly in order for the Commander to manoeuvre his fleet either towards or away from the enemy - depending on whether he was in a position to gain this supreme advantage or ensure the enemy did not.  Some say Jellicoe had very good reasons for turning away - whereas others disagree.<br /><br />In order to give the British public a better idea of exactly what went on during the Battle, two Naval Officers - who had also been present at the Battle, collected together 60 accounts from those who had fought in British ships.  Their purpose was to give the reader an insight into what had gone on throughout the British fleet and across the RN rank structure at this time.  Suitably edited, they then placed these contributions together in the chronological order of the Battle.  Politically sensitive, however, it was difficult to get the material published with only half the material finally seeing print at that time.<br /><br />This book contains all the original text and also the carefully chosen photographs, sketches and charts which were so important to that first edition.  Entirely re-set to make it more readable, this is an excellent book - for those contemplating a trip to the wrecks in question - and for those who are not.<br /><br />NMr />This book contains all the original text and also the carefully chosen photographs, sketches and charts which were so important to that first edition.

These publishers have a reputation for high standards - in terms of quality of information and standard of photography, and it is easy to see why.<br /><br />\\"Diving Hawaii\\" is clearly laid out with chapters on; An introduction to the Hawaiian Islands, Diving in general, the specific dive sites of Oahu, Maui, Hawaii and Kauai and local Marine Life. The book concludes with some very useful Appendixes containing; Emergency information, details of local Scuba Diving centres, miscellaneous useful numbers for visitors and some brief notes on another 20 dive sites.<br /><br />Chapter One begins with an all-important historical pr&eacute;cis of Hawaii. This gives the visitor a brief insight into the country's first Polynesian settlers, the way in which the country was then ruled by it's own system of chiefs for something like 1,000 years, the islands' discovery by Captain Cook, the importance of sugar plantations, the time when Hawaii became a US territory and, eventually (in 1959) the 50th State. All of which is followed by equally important notes on present day Hawaii and all the essential information the visitor needs to know.<br /><br />Chapter 2 is an overview of Diving in general with notes on; boat, shore and night diving as well as conservation. There is also a very important and well written description of the unusual underwater lava tubes and cave formations created by the flow of volcanic lava into the sea. These are probably very different from any other form of Cave Diving found anywhere else in the world and Page 21 is rightly devoted to a full-page warning of the dangers involved here.<br /><br />We now come to those Chapters individually dedicated to each of the four main islands in the Hawaiian group and these take in any smaller adjacent islands as well. Once again, we are treated to an introduction to the island itself before getting down to diving specifics. This commences with a map of the island(s) showing the primary dive sites as numbers - each of which is then described in more than adequate detail and headed by the relevant depth, experience level required and access.<br /><br />Altogether a well-rounded book containing all the information required by anyone considering a diving trip to Hawaii.<br /><br />According to the Author's biography on the back page, Steve Rosenberg specialises in underwater photography.

Beginning with a chapter headed \\"Evolution of the Aircraft Carrier,\\" the author successfully explains the early days of aircraft at sea and the problems encountered in providing them with a mobile, floating base from which to operate - and return.  With sections devoted to explaining flight-deck geometry, the catapult, landing systems and hangars, this provides an essential lead-in to the information that is to follow.<br /><br />Chapter 2 gives the reader an insight into the changing \\"Role\\" of the Aircraft Carrier. This is a journey from those early days of \\"spotter planes\\" - required to do no more than report the whereabouts of enemy ships, right through to the ultimate modern-day, mobile nuclear powered system for delivering offensive airborne weapons to any corner of the world's seas.<br /><br />With the right amount of graphs, ships' profiles, technical and historical information, this book is a scholarly piece of work. It was particularly interesting to see how the speed of carrier-borne aircraft has improved from less than 100 mph in 1915 to over 1,500 mph in 1972 and how the ratio of capital ships to aircraft carriers had completely reversed over a similar period.  Further changes and modifications due to the advent of the British designed Sea Harrier are also covered in great detail.<br /><br />Surprisingly, few countries (14 in all) appear to have ever employed Aircraft Carriers in their fleets and the remainder of the book gives full details of these countries and their ships in alphabetical order. Here one discovers how such historic ships as HMS Warrior built by Harland & Wolff and launched 20 May 1944 and HMS Vengeance (Swan Hunter - 23 February 1944) were renamed Independencia and Minas Gerais when they eventually became the pride of the Argentinean and Brazilian navies respectively.<br /><br />The plentiful supply of historical photographs throughout the book are particularly well chosen.  These include everything from the earliest attempts at launching aircraft from warships prior to WW1, the only known picture of the Japanese Shinano - displacing a massive 64,800 tons and lost in November 1944 prior to completion, and examples of every type of Carrier right up to the mighty nuclear powered USS Nimitz class and much more besides.<br /><br />In short, this book contains everything you are ever likely to want to know about Aircraft Carriers and I congratulate both the author and publishers for a job well done.<br /><br />NMout the book are particularly well chosen.

Without that standard of photography, the book would have received nothing at all.<br /><br />I ordered this book because I needed to know more about certain areas of the Egyptian Red Sea I was due to visit. Since then, I have conducted professional assignments to three different regions and each time I found the book to be of limited value. This is purely a reference book and, with 52 pages devoted to the principle sites of Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Eritrea combined and a full 64 pages devoted to Egypt, I began to wonder about how much original information I would find in this book...  The answer was \\"Not a lot.\\"<br /><br />The layout is generally very good but, for those photographs that are captioned, descriptions such as \\"A wave breaking on a healthy reef of stony corals\\" (stony corals. What are they?) or \\"Divers exploring the wreck of a cruising yacht in the Deep South\\" (a yacht, incidentally, that is not mentioned anywhere else in the entire book.), left me somewhat bemused.<br /><br />The book is packed with the sort of information one needs to know. Unfortunately, I soon found myself mistrusting almost everything written. All writers and publishers have a duty of care towards the reader and it is vitally important that the \\"general information\\" on such topics as Culture, Religion, Climate, Visas etc are correct. It is also important that the Diving information is accurate and well-researched. Because this latter element of the book (and after all, it is a \\"Diving Guide.\\") is lacking in so many areas, it brings into question the accuracy of all the information given.<br /><br />Take for example the Sudanese shipwreck described as the \\"Labanzo.\\" For the record the correct name is \\"Levanzo\\" - a vessel built in 1901 and lost in 1940. The book also contains that perennial favourite the \\"Sarah H\\" in Egypt.

I have given this book the lowest possible rating for two main reasons; Firstly it lacks overall credibility and, secondly, the State laws of Queensland have been flouted.<br /><br />Any book with a title that suggests it is a Diving Guide to the Great Barrier Reef is making a very big claim and I took delivery with great excitement. Sadly, I was very quickly disappointed. The Great Barrier Reef of Australia is over 1,200 miles long and this book covers just 27 dive sites with varying degrees of thoroughness. Starting with 7 sites off Cairns, the author then takes the reader on a quick dash to Heron Island - some 600 miles south, for another 3 sites before returning to those previously visited northern climes to resume and conclude. In short, the title of this book is misleading.<br /><br />More importantly, however, I did find certain specific content most upsetting.<br /><br />Pages 11 and 47 contain photographs showing Divers physically touching and manhandling, the Giant Grouper (Epinephelus tukula) commonly known as the Potato Cod. Strangely, the captions for these photographs are at odds with the content - in that they correctly inform the reader that human contact with these fish is detrimental and may leave them open to parasitic invasion by removing the creature's own protective mucus. Clearly a question of do as I say - but NOT as I do when \\"I\\" take photographs.<br /><br />Similarly, page 140 describes how the \\"State Laws of Queensland\\" specifically prohibit divers from entering the shipwreck \\"Yongala.\\" 137 people lost their lives when this vessel foundered in 1911 and, having made those \\"Laws\\" quite clear, the author then advises Divers to take a torch and on pages 140 and 141 promptly shows his own images from the ship's interior - a clear demonstration of how Australian laws have been blatantly flouted in the production of this book.<br /><br />Altogether, quite disgraceful!<br /><br />NM	2001-01-14

It proved to be an excellent choice of book.<br /><br />The Cave Divers traces the history of Cave Diving from the earliest beginnings - where explorers held their breath and plunged into freezing waters deep inside hitherto unexplored cave systems, through the era of tremendous discovery made possible by Scuba Diving equipment and right up to the advent of modern Rebreather systems.<br /><br />Combining his personal experience of over 50 years of diving with a very easy style of writing, the author has created a fascinating and readable account of the successes and failures that has made the sport of Cave Diving exactly what it is - one of the most advanced, technical and adventurous forms of diving available today.<br /><br />The book commences with various accounts of early adventurers such as; Count Begouen who discovered artefacts made by prehistoric man in the dry caves of the Pyres in 1913, Casteret who, in 1932, risked life and limb to plunge almost naked into a dark and icy abyss to make one of the most unique finds in the annals of discovery and exploration - and with nothing more than a candle and a box of matches, the very first attempts to explore the caves of Somerset in 1934 and a detailed account of how both Cousteau and Dumas came very close to death in the Fountain of Vaucluse in 1946.<br /><br />Chapter by chapter this book visits the important cave systems of the Bahamas, Europe, UK, USA and Venezuela as it explains many of the individual accomplishments made by the men and women who pioneered, expanded and continue to develop the sport of Cave Diving.  In this way, the Author brings the reader through each significant milestone, contribution and innovation right up to the very latest in Rebreather systems before finally concluding with his own view of what the future holds.<br /><br />This book will be of interest to Cave Diver and non-Cave Diver alike - and invaluable for those contemplating taking up the sport. My only criticism is that it contains no mention whatsoever of the late Rob Palmer  - who's own contribution was far from insignificant<br /><br />NMr /> <br />This book will be of interest to Cave Diver and non-Cave Diver alike - and invaluable for those contemplating taking up the sport.
