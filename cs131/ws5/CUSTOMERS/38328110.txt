At the time of writing there is no photo included.<br /><br />The third edition is definitely an improvement over the first and second.  It reflects a number of advances in technology and the sciences.  (See under words such as \\"net\\" and \\"web\\").  How anyone could compile a dictionary these days without such entries is beyond me.<br /><br />Of interest to some may be the order of the strokes used in the radical index.  See page 1 of the E-C section.  This dictionary and N.H. Leon's Character Indexes of Modern Chinese (ISBN: 0-7007-0134-6 see my review) use dian, heng, shu, pie, zhe;  Clavis Sinica, ABC/Wenlin, xinhua zidian and A Chinese-English Handbook for Learning Chinese Characters use heng, shu, pie, dian, zhe.  The right-falling stroke, na, is categorised with dian in both systems.<br /><br />Speaking of additional books, I can't go past giving Laurence Matthews' Chinese Character Fast Finder (ISBN: 0-8048-3634-5) a mention.  It greatly speeds up looking up characters.  I can see a character on a sign across the street and find it in seconds in this fast-finder.  This is much faster, and easier, than using a radical index.<br /><br />The number of radicals used is another common difference between dictionaries.  The most common systems being 189 and 214 radicals.  This is generally, but not always, based on the difference between simplified and traditional characters.  Oxford uses 188 (i.e. close to the 189 system).<br /><br />I entitled this review \\"Good all-rounder\\" because in a sense this dictionary is just that, there is no cross-referencing between synonyms, no handy hints for usage (other than part of speech and taboo symbol) and no idea given as to whether a term is common or obscure.  The latter omission is not assisted by the jiu or shu symbols indicating either archaic or literary, as a term doesn't need to be archaic nor literary to be obscure.<br /><br />This dictionary comes in two sizes.  I recommend, if you do purchase it, that you get the larger size, as the font is too small to show the more complex characters with enough clarity.  The large size is still not too heavy to stick into your bag and trek around China.

We have just \\"re-discovered\\" Where The Wild Things Are, and enjoy it immensely.<br /><br />It reminds me of my own childhood, similar to countless other previous reviewers.  For myself, however, it wasn't a book we actually had around the house.  Doubtlessly I remember it from a public library reading or elsewhere.<br /><br />The pictures are so intricate and the colours are vibrant, but yet subdued.  When we reach the three pages of the \\"rumpus\\" (in which there are no words, only pictures), I like to leave it that way, and not comment on the scenery to the child, but just turn the pages very slowly in silence, watching him gaze at the pictures.<br /><br />This book enjoys ongoing popularity.  Recently it's been reviewed on Amazon every couple of days!  Little wonder, as it is a joy and an inspiration to young and old (and in between) alike.<br /><br />Another favourite of ours you may like to try is The Monster at the End of this Book Starring Lovable, Furry Old Grover (ISBN: 0-307-16025-4).  It is (backcover) \\"...the bestselling Sesame Street book of all time...\\"	2005-10-04

Perhaps that which sets it apart the most is its thorough references to early Christian literature at the time.  This gives us a fuller understanding of what words actually mean.  Too often we are confined to other examples within the canon of Scripture itself for further light on what a word means.  Here we are taken much further.<br /><br />The very informative \\"Foreword to the Revised Edition\\" and \\"Introduction to the Lexicon of the Greek New Testament\\" are included, and should be read for a greater understanding of how the dictionary works, the history of the lexicon and some tips on New Testament Greek itself.<br /><br />The head word includes the full lexical form which, for example, means:<br /><br />a) If the word is an adjective, the inflection/s for each gender of the nominative case are provided.<br /><br />b) If the word is a noun, the nominative and genitive forms and the article are included.<br /><br />After the (bolded) presentation of the head word, it is presented in a number of important forms.  These are either the 1st person singular of different tenses/moods of the verb paradigms or commonly used forms.<br /><br />Because of the fullness of the material and the need to save space, many abbreviations are used.  It is worth familiarising oneself with the abbreviations by skimming over the \\"Composite List of Abbreviations\\" page LIXff before dipping too far into your work.<br /><br />Possible improvements:<br /><br />1) Mounce's categorisation of each word into a given code is quite well known and widely used (these can be found in his Basics of Biblical Greek, Analytical Lexicon and Morphology of Biblical Greek).  It would be a great future improvement of BDAG to include these codes alongside each entry.<br /><br />2) The font used makes kappas and rhos look funny and I personally need to look at a word twice at times in order to be able to tell what it is.  A less cursive-style font would look better in future editions.<br /><br />3) Little/no use is made of the front and back inside cover or back of the book.  The back has some sample entries, which, while handy for a bookstore who may want to seal the book to maintain its good condition, it is a bit of a bore to someone who has owned the lexicon for some years.  It would be better to include something worth memorising or a few quotes scholars have made about the dictionary itself.<br /><br />If looking this book up in your library catalogue or any online resource, please note that it will not necessarily help to type in what it is commonly known as - BDAG.

Other than the editor John DeFrancis himself, there are five associate editors, four editorial associates, two computer associates and twelve proofreading associates (two of whom double as associate editors).  This spread of \\"eyes\\" is important with dictionary compilation as the fewer people working on the text, the more nuanced the definitions and selection of words.<br /><br />I like the inclusion of the Kangxi and Comprehensive Radical Charts at the \\"back end paper verso\\" (back cover) of the dictionary.  The front covers are blank, which could have been used in a similar way, perhaps for a summary of stroke-order rules.<br /><br />Speaking of stroke-order rules, I have rarely, if ever, seen a satisfactory treatment of this in any Chinese text, let alone dictionary.  Unfortunately this includes the volume at hand.  The best method that I have seen is employed for the use of Japanese lexicography, in Hadamitzky and Spahn's Kanji & Kana (Tuttle - 0-8048-2077-5).<br /><br />On the whole, however, the appendices included at the back are comprehensive, necessary and easy to follow.<br /><br />The inclusion of words with Roman lettering (such as \\"a Q jingshen - attitude that treats defeats as personal moral victories\\" p9) shows the trend towards the use of English words and letters interspersed in Mandarin in modern China.<br /><br />The \\"er\\" retroflexive suffix is a handy inclusion - at each relevant entry - for anyone wanting to travel to Beijing or the surrounding area.  The same word can have this suffix appended or not, depending on the intended meaning.  Thus, it is of great benefit to be able to check at a glance whether it is included in each individual entry, without having to memorise the rule/s concerned.  A cheap handbook (shou ce) on the \\"er\\" suffix, called \\"hanyu erhuaci xuexi shouce / Chinese-er suffixed words without tears\\" is available, published by Beijing University.<br /><br />It would have been good if measure words were included in the entries as well.  But this may have overly complicated the process, as a word can have more than one measure word depending on the context in which it is used.  On page 1360 and onwards, however, there is a very useful appendix listing many measure words and their respective usages.<br /><br />Whenever a character has been simplified, the traditional character is shown in square brackets.  This is essential for anyone interested in the etymology of a character.  Also, if you have spent time in Hong Kong or Shen Zhen, or have studied Chinese before using fantizi (traditional characters) you will appreciate being able to move from the familiar to the more challenging.<br /><br />This dictionary has an electronic counterpart, namely Wenlin.  Wenlin is top-of-the-range Chinese dictionary software, with many added benefits over using the book alone.  This includes a flashcards function, a drawing box for character look-up, and spoken pronunciation of a high quality; not to mention the ability to upgrade from Wenlin's website.<br /><br />If you are thinking of buying both the ABC dictionary and Wenlin, I would err on the side of \\"lexical diversity\\" by choosing Wenlin and, possibly, Oxford's 3rd edition English-Chinese/Chinese-English dictionary, the one with the red cover (0-19-596457-8).  The benefits of this, are twofold. First, you would have an English-Chinese dictionary (which ABC has not and Wenlin's is limited).  Second, the Oxford dictionary is smaller, and much more portable, than ABC (but the 1999 edition of ABC is available in a smaller size).<br /><br />Although the text size is quite small, the print quality is of such a standard that the components and shape of complicated characters (i.e. jiantizi - simplified - but still complicated) can still be discerned.<br /><br />Perhaps most importantly, with this dictionary most of all, please read the Introductionand Reader's Guide at the front of this dictionary as soon as possible.  It contains information on the arrangement of words, orthography, parts of speech and many other indispensable tools.<br /><br />In short, highly recommended, 5 stars without a moment's hesitation.se read the Introduction and Reader's Guide at the front of this dictionary as soon as possible.

The 3rd edition of this volume (0195911512 being the 2nd edition) has many new technological and scientific words).<br /><br />Some ideas for a future edition:<br /><br />1) Make the most common disyllabic entry bold so that it can be memorised as a locator for \\"AB de A\\" or \\"AB de B\\" questions to identify characters (i.e. happy - gaoxing, if this is the most common word under \\"gao\\" then it should be made bold, which will enable us to memorise \\"gaoxing de gao ma?\\"<br /><br />2) Include a section on stroke order rules, such as in Hadamitzky and Spahn's Kanji & Kana (0804820775).	2005-08-09

Books	5	27	31	N	N	For all Christians	Timothy George is founding dean and professor at Beeson Divinity School. He has also been a pastor and editor of numerous Christian magazines. Currently he is executive editor of Christianity Today.<br /><br />This thinish 159 page volume provides useful information for the Christian about Islam.  As the back cover blurb states \\"The days when Western Christians could ignore the influence of Islam are over.\\"<br /><br />Not only does Dr George help make Islam more understandable, but he also explains the importance of various differences between Christianity and Islam.  Perhaps most importantly, the doctrine of the Trinity is explained, defended and celebrated.  Dr George says (p55) \\"Ironically, the doctrine of the Trinity may be at one and the same time the most important and the most neglected dotrine we hold.\\"<br /><br />The deity of Christ is another important point for any Christian wishing to examine Islam at close range.  Page 62: To call Jesus Lord, not just with the lips but from the heart, is to become a Christian...\\"<br /><br />It is at the beginning of the chapter \\"Why the Trinity matters\\" (p69) that Dr George answers the question of whether the Father of Jesus is the God of Muhammad \\"The answer to this question is surely both yes and no. Yes, in the sense that the Father of Jesus is the only God there is...also no for Muslim theology rejects the fatherhood of God, the deity of Jesus Christ, and the personhood of the Holy Spirit-each of which is an essential component of the Christian understanding of God.\\"<br /><br />I found the testimony of Lamin Sanneh (p102-103) quite moving.  It is very reassuring to hear of converts from Islam to Christianity based on sound reasoning.  This is especially the case when the convert concerned was a \\"leading theologian and scholar of Islam\\".<br /><br />In chapter six, \\"Grace for the straight path\\", we are told \\"We need grace, not simply guidance\\" (p115).  This points back to page 29, in which we are shown the first seven verses of the first surah of the Qu'ran that includes the words \\"Guide us in the straight path\\".  I had to pause for a minute to understand this connection - but maybe that's just me.<br /><br />Dr George counsels the use of both patience and perseverance (p128) in sharing the Gospel with Muslims.  This means we need to employ neither \\"...the vilification of Islam and the denigration of Muhammad...\\" nor a pluralistic \\"...cavalier attitude toward truth...\\"<br /><br />I didn't find one typographical error in the whole book!first seven verses of the first surah of the Qu'ran that includes the words \\"Guide us in the straight path\\".

The former chapters look at intelligent reasons for the differences between the four Gospels, while the latter chapters expand on the different emphases found in the Gospels and apply them to other parts of Scripture and also explain how to apply this fourfold principle to our own lives.<br /><br />The thesis put forward is that God's nature is revealed \\"...in four main aspects or faces: as powerful king, suffering servant, perfect human being and holy God\\".  And indeed good arguments are put forward to show that God really does reveal himself to have a fourfold nature consistently in Scripture.  It is stressed that this quadruple format can be loosely applied, that each of the faces/aspects overlap somewhat, and that no single aspect should be stuck to too rigidly.  (We must remember that the God we worship is Trinitarian in nature - threefold).<br /><br />Bickersteth is now with Christ, but left behind much of the backbone of the manuscript with Pain who continued to apply the theory to paper.<br /><br />I was not able to simply skim through this book to do it justice, but the time spent thoroughly reading it has paid me bid dividends in studying the Scriptures and it will do the same for you too.	2005-06-13

This book can be used as a sole text for deductive study of the Japanese syllabaries.  What I say here will mainly refer to Kanji, and not Kana.<br /><br />My interest is more Chinese, but the only additions required to make it just as useful for Chinese study are jiantizi and hanyu pinyin marginal notes.  These can be added quite quickly by using the Chinese Wenlin software package.<br /><br />Many students of Chinese feel that it is not an economical usage of time to be using Japanese textbooks to achieve their goal.  They say that many Japanese Kanji have either evolved away from their Chinese equivalents or are now obsolete.<br /><br />My feeling with regard to the latter point is that if you really want to know a language deeply, you won't care how obsolete a word is.  Etymology and broadness of reading ability come into play.<br /><br />However, the setout of K&K is far better for stroke-order than any Chinese text I've seen.  The component for ear (\\"er\\" - in Chinese) has different stroke order to Japanese, and it is important to note the differences as they may arise.<br /><br />The newer edition is neater, as the less common Kanji are included in the main list, and in a nicer font.	2005-06-12

The paradigms and referencing system is also something you'd definitely pick this volume up for.  Every word is accented throughout.<br /><br />A few minor errors (then again it could always be me that's wrong):<br /><br />p50- \\"preperispomenon\\" should be \\"properispomenon\\"<br /><br />p201- n3d(1) should include KREAS (meat).<br /><br />p335- ERHMOS is a-3a, but also n-2b, see footnote 3 on p232.<br /><br />I bought the soft-cover from Amazon, but immediately covered it with contact.  It is too valuable to allow to fray.<br /><br />In short, this is a very handy volume, but usefulness is lessened by reliance on the short contents page and a word index without page numbers to find one's way around.	2005-06-11

However, this review is not about these two programs, but about the book Special Edition Using WordPerfect 12.<br /><br />One of the most important features of a book such as this (which is about 2 inches thick) is its index.  I find the index to be well laid out, easy to read and a good combination of bold and plain text.  There is also a Contents at a Glance on the very first page, as well as the Contents proper.<br /><br />Enhancements of WordPerfect 11 and 12 are separately listed on pages 3 to 6, and there is also a list of combined enhancements on pages 6 to 7, which originated with a service pack for version 11.<br /><br />The ease of pasting unformatted text from other programs/documents (an essential feature - done in a more round-about way in MS Word) is summed up well: \\"When you copy text from another source, you also copy formatting codes.  To paste unformatted text, choose Edit, Paste Special, and choose Unformatted\\" (p494).  I use this feature all the time, and believe a shortcut key would come in handy here.<br /><br />Another handy section begins on page 575: Simplifying a Complex Document with Cross-References.  What this does is automatically updates a constantly moving entry which says something like \\"...see page 86...\\".  If it weren't for this the manual alternatives could be disastrous!<br /><br />I'm even appreciative of the ad for CorelDRAW on the very last page!  It's a great program which should really be integrated (or even sold with) WordPerfect.<br /><br />Overall: Highly recommended.  Special Edition Using WordPerfect 12 complements the simplicity and comprehensiveness of WordPerfect itself.	2005-06-10

That is the softening of the doctrine of Hell (on capitalisation of Hell see my review of The Chicago Manual of Style).  What can I say?  I believe the best way to assess J.P.

It needs to be seen as just that.  Q (Quelle, or source) material is that which the Gospels Matthew and Luke are said to be based on, aside from marcan material.  Many such hypotheses are entertained in the field of New Testament criticism.  Two good books which provide balances to some of these hypotheses are:<br /><br />Bauckham, Richard (1998) The Gospels for all Christians.

Her conversion story (covered partially in her introduction - pages 17-20) is a beautiful example of God's sovereign grace.<br /><br />The term \\"Historical Criticism\\" is really only defined by the translator - page 7.  This may be because Historical Criticism is a more well-known term in the German.  It does not seem to be the same as \\"the Historical-Critical Method\\" which Edgar Krentz writes about in the Fortress Press offering in the \\"Guides to Biblical Scholarship\\" series.  Rather, it includes all the higher criticisms, such as form and redactional criticism.  Textual criticism is an example of lower criticism, which, used honestly and properly, glorifies God because it is aimed at ascertaining what the text of the original languages actually says, rather than dodging the commands of a holy God.  Good introductions to Textual Criticism are Clayton Harrop's \\"History of the New Testament in Plain Language\\" and D.A. Carson's \\"The King James Version Debate\\".  The latter is not simply a polemic against the KJV, it is also a very helpful primer on textual criticism.  For those who want to get more serious (or who have slightly deeper pockets), Bruce Metzger's \\"A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament\\" is indispensable.<br /><br />There are three reasons why I was lead to this book:<br /><br />1) It is in the \\"For Further Reading\\" section of \\"Theological Liberalism: A Handful of Pebbles\\" by Peter Barnes (along with Machen's \\"Christianity and Liberalism\\", Murray's \\"Evangelicalism Divided\\" and Shaeffer's \\"The Great Evangelical Disaster\\".  After having read Barnes' excellent book on theological liberalism I decided to work my way through his whole \\"For Further Reading\\" section.<br /><br />2) I enjoyed, Linnemann's \\"Is there a Synoptic Problem?\\", which is also translated by Yarbrough.<br /><br />3) The overall importance and urgency of the subject matter that Linnemann covers.<br /><br />I thought that the rather lengthy proposal for evangelical learning centres should have been in the latter part of the book, rather than the former.

It's a bit like feminist Irshad Manji remaining a Muslim (though she, herself, says that it's only by the fingernails).  Certainly there are examples of leftists in places like Denmark who are changing their minds because of the mass Islamic immigration that they see around them and its effects.<br /><br />That said, a future instalment by Bruce will doubtlessly show (true) progressive thinking and will not disappoint.	2005-05-19

I would wholeheartedly recommend this book to a very wide audience.<br /><br />Some previous, non-religious reviewers, in some of the longer reviews, have accused Spencer of being unbalanced.  They have said that he dwells too much on his own faith, Christianity and isn't fair to Islam.  But please see pages 113-116 on the achievements of Muslims in science and poetry.  He also is quick (in my opinion too quick) to point out the sins of Christianity.  Not too one-sided in my opinion.<br /><br />On the crusades, Spencer includes a refreshing balance-correcting chapter (ch8).  Another good single chapter read on the subject is found in Jacques Ellul's Subversion of Christianity (ISBN: 0802800491 - the one gripe I have with this chapter/book, is its swipe at Calvinism).  Indeed, there were no crusades before the advent of Islam and it can be strongly put that they were purely and simply a reaction to it, if not imitation of it.  If Christianity was originally spread because the disciples saw, believed and couldn't contain themselves regarding the resurrection appearances, then how was Islam spread?  Did all the people of the Middle East peacefully say \\"I no longer believe what I was given by the four who testified, namely Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, and will now stake everything on the writings of Mohammed\\"?  It would appear that violence was involved.<br /><br />If the same decision was before me, and it has been, I'd need to make a thorough enquiry of Mohammed's character to see whether his testimony is weightier than the abovementioned four.<br /><br />It is clear that a large proportion of the negative reviewers who have only contributed 5 lines have not found anything concrete in the book that they could argue against, if indeed they have read the book at all.  It appears to be a common practice amongst Muslims today to distribute email lists of books they want to flood with negative reviews.  The same goes for blogs which are negative about Islam.<br /><br />A previous reviewer has said that 700 Jews that Mohammed slaughtered (tribe/clan/group unspecified) broke a treaty with him and \\"committed treason\\".  Don Richardson, in \\"Secrets of the Koran\\" (ISBN: 0830731237), demonstrates that the three tribes of Jews killed by Mohammed and his companions could not have been aggressors or at fault in the conflicts.that Mohammed slaughtered (tribe/clan/group unspecified) broke a treaty with him and \\"committed treason\\".

I have just finished reading Secrets of the Koran and am excited, but at the same time concerned for the future of our freedom.  I am excited because such a truthful and uncompromising book has been (and still can be) written and made available.  I am concerned because I do believe that Mr Richardson's description of what the world could be like under future Islamic domination is all too real.<br /><br />This book is so important that it should be made available wherever it can be safely sold (or made available in libraries) without having a fatwa issued against those responsible.<br /><br />Please approach your bookshop and suggest that they make some shelf-space available for this great, new book.  Please buy a copy and offer it as a donation to your local library.  You may wish to give it to them to peruse first, with a note inserted that if they don't want to keep it, it should be returned to you.  If the librarian says that the book is too biases or unacceptable for any other reason, be prepared to come back at them regarding the anti-Christian and pro-Islamic books already on their shelves.  Write letters.  Ask your Christian friends to get involved.<br /><br />Speaking of Christian friends.  Something so refreshing about this book, written by a fellow Christian, is that it faces reality about humanistic professors in Western countries needing to show a little more kindness towards Christianity, as it fills a gap which militant Islam will all-too-willingly march into.  And militant Islam will have no respect for the rights of the great-grandchild of the humanistic professor!  I, myself, have heard mounds of anti-Christian diatribe from university professors which was *totally* off-topic.<br /><br />The only reservation I have of this book is that I found most of Appendix A unnecessary.  The inclusivist/exclusivist controversy within Christianity is, more or less, relevant to how we dialogue with Muslims, but this could have been condensed into a brief description (or, better, chart/table) of the difference between general and special Revelation, the summation on page 247 and a few references for further reading.  However, I wouldn't blame Mr Richardson if he responded (to me) \\"write your own book!\\" and \\"I could carve a better man out of a banana!\\" (see Vonnegut's \\"Slaughterhouse 5\\").<br /><br />(...)the difference between general and special Revelation, the summation on page 247 and a few references for further reading.

I thought it would be quite useful for looking up characters, so tried to find it.  Not available on Amazon itself, I eventually found one through a second-hand dealer associated with it.<br /><br />There are 4 indexes in this book.  Pinyin, Radical, Four-corner numbers and Stroke-order numbers.  The third of these seems to have fallen into disuse in China.  I've spoken to Chinese people in Australia who know of people that use the Stroke-order numbers as an input method.  This probably isn't with computers with up-to-date operating systems, because Chinese can be easily entered using Microsoft's own facilities built into XP.  And prior to that there was Twinbridge or Chinese Star.<br /><br />The most valuable parts of this book are:<br /><br />(1) It has a great radical index of characters, which is actually like a URI (universal radical index), similar to that found in the \\"New Nelson\\" Japanese dictionary.  Most dictionaries only use the one radical which the character is classified under.<br /><br />(2) It helps you identify which radical a character actually takes, which is useful in seeing why a character is indexed the way it is in another dictionary.<br /><br />(3) It includes many characters.  Both fantizi and jiantizi.<br /><br />I doubt you'd find \\"Character Indexes of Modern Chinese\\" in China.  It's #42 of the Scandinavian Institute of Asian Studies Monograph Series!	2005-04-18

I take it with me whenever I take my Bible with me.  I couldn't fault any of the choices Mr Kohlenberger has made regarding where to place readings in the chronology.<br /><br />The author (p9) uses and recommends the New International Version of the Scriptures.  A fine choice.  My favorite too.  If, however, you wish to attempt to read the King James Version through, another booklet you may find handy is \\"The King James Bible Companion: Over 500 archaic words defined\\" 1999: David W. Daniels, Chick Publications.  This could be used simultaneously with the booklet under discussion as it is not a reading plan and is also very slim for travel purposes.<br /><br />Two pleas to the potential user:<br /><br />(1) The readings list itself being only a few pages (aside from the commentaries and other material): Please avoid the temptation to photocopy for yourself or others.  Mr Kohlenberger deserves every cent he can make from the sales of this excellent resource.  I purchased several for my young people's group at Church, and have had very positive feedback.<br /><br />(2) Avoid denigrating the order in which God's Word has come down to us.  Whilst following the guide is an excellent way to learn the Scriptures, avoid comments, particularly in sermons, like: \\"Whoever put the Bible together must have been very disorganised.\\"  Not exactly an edifying approach!	2005-04-12
US	38328110	RO9EJMCAZ7E9O	019431197X	90941561	Practical English Usage	Books	5	11	16	N	N	An excellent resource	This book really is an indispensable resource for any teacher of English as a second language or serious student.  I have the Eighteenth impression (2004), which is a reprint of the second edition of 1995.  The language terminology section at the beginning (ppxxi-xxix) is particularly useful for those wanting clarification of the meaning of grammatical or other technical terms.  The use of red for headings and an eye-friendly font is also greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Being an Australian I think it would have been nice if some of the other styles of English were at least summarised as far as their main features are concerned, rather than just the usual UK & US.  This would also apply to other parts of the world such as New Zealand and South Africa.<br /><br />Regarding the zero conditional commented on in a past review, I just wrote it in.  An example of a zero conditional is \\"If water boils it steams.\\"  The condition is always the same.<br /><br />The greater difficulty I found in relation to this is that the conditionals are not listed at entry #141 (p128) at \\"Conditional\\", nor is there a cross reference to where they are listed.  Rather, they are found at #258 (p245), entitled \\"if (1): introduction\\".  Some of this cross-referencing I am doing myself on an ongoing basis.<br /><br />I felt that greater detail as far as the formulas of English sentences could have been provided.  e.g.:<br /><br />(S)ubject + (Aux. V)erb + \\"been\\" + (V)erb (-ing) form.<br /><br />Those parts within parentheses (brackets) could be the abbreviated forms, included if there were a lack of space.	2005-03-28

As this book is really meant to be an locator/index of Chinese characters, I thought it should be able to do just that.  So, before purchasing it, I looked up one or two characters and found it only took a couple of seconds!<br /><br />This is far better than using the radical index of a dictionary if you don't know the hanyu pinyin.  At times the radical for a character can be quite arbitrary.  I believe it is no longer the case, but apparently characters could, in the past, be listed under a radical it had nothing, seemingly, to do with.<br /><br />Careful!  The thick black line for page 68 of the thumb-index is misdrawn, causing me the need to re-stick my #68.  Frustrating!<br /><br />An alternative for home use is the Wenlin Chinese Dictionary software, which makes looking up characters a breeze if you can handle the mouse ok.  But on the run this won't be possible, until they bring out their PDA version - IF you can afford a PDA.  At only about $32 in Australia the Chinese Character Fast Finder is a great buy!<br /><br />Laurence Matthews also has a Kanji Fast Finder out too.	2005-03-12

The bio on the cover says that \\"after Ausgustine\\" he is one of the most important theologians.  I wasn't certain whether this was literally 'after' or 'in the footsteps of...' both standpoints being partly true.<br /><br />Certainly, Calvin's exegetical methodology in writing commentaries is examined later in this book, and having looked at both Augustine's allegorising and Calvin's systematic approach, I would have to say that Calvin doesn't really follow \\"after Augustine\\" in this sense!<br /><br />I recommend, prior to reading this, you get your hands on a copy of \\"Man of Geneva\\" from Banner of Truth.

It is certainly &quot;complete&quot; enough for me!  And exhaustive wherever it needs to be.  To quote the preface: &quot;...it lists all the references for every word indexed.&quot;<br />This may seem very basic and perhaps unnecessary advice, but if you do own this concordance, or use it to any great extent, make sure you read and digest the short preface.<br />All the words not included are listed in an appendix at p1041ff.  It did strike me as odd that &quot;sons&quot; is included in the concordance, but not &quot;daughters&quot;.  Not that I could usually give two hoots about inclusive language or anything (provided my job doesn't depend on it).  I suppose at times in the Bible &quot;sons&quot; may have more theological significance when it comes to such ideas as &quot;sons of men&quot;, which is semantically intended to be an inclusive term anyway.<br />I disagree with the previous reviewer who implies that the NRSV is more worthy of juxtaposing with the NIV than any other versions.  The NIV is excellent version in its own right and is comparable to the whole breadth of translations available today, not just the NRSV (which, in Australia at least, is used to a disproportionately high extent within the liberal/modernist sections of the church).<br />This is a great concordance for readers of the English Bible.  However, for a real grasp on word usage within Scripture, it is also worth using exhaustive Hebrew and Greek concordances and have some knowledge of these inflected languages and how they are parsed.	2004-04-03

'Kingdom Now!' was probably intended for a more local readership (Surrey, UK).  Furthermore, Coates is \\"writing to charismatic evangelical churches\\" (p121).  Naturally many fold will feel very much at home with this type of literature, while others may have found it much easier to relate to Coates if he had not been so specific in describing his audience.<br /><br />There are some issues addressed which certainly need attention in the church today, such as the need to rid ourselves of some of our traditional values which are not necessarily Scriptural, especially for the cause of keeping young people in the Church.  Indeed A.W.Tozer is cited as saying: \\"We have exported an unlovely brand of Christianity.\\"<br /><br />Mind you (and I'm saying this in a later edit of this review), given what I've said in the above paragraph - I can't remember if Coates was referring to hymns versus modern music.

The original title for this book was &quot;Father make us one&quot;, which was a more appropriate title for the book, because &quot;Learning to love people you don't like&quot; implies the book is discussing relationships between people who may or may not be within the Christian community.<br />Upon reading the book, I found most of the research was oriented this way.  &quot;Father make us one&quot; gives us the understanding that the book solely discusses relationships within the body of Christ, so many questions the reader may have about how to love unbelievers we don't particularly like remain unanswered.<br />In this era when pride has crept into the church to such a degree that we find fellowships splitting as a result of peripheral matters, a book such as this one by a member of Youth With A Mission, who are so thirsty for souls, will put those unimportant matters into proper perspective as we unite in the one goal of winning others for Christ.	2004-03-31

What really makes this book special is Campolo's ability to cover a topic which should be of interest to Christians but sadly, at times, isn't, and that is the environment.<br />This topic, as Campolo points out, is given considerable attention in Scripture and one can see the truth in his argument that &quot;...it is a humanistic distortion to think that nature was created by God solely for the benefit of Adam and Eve and their successors.&quot;  This book has therefore made me realise how selfish we humans can be.<br />It is a really great joy to read, and various hints on how to be more ecologically friendly are presented so that the ideals put forth could be further within one's grasp in a practical way.<br />A star off for his undefended premillennialist statement and for dodgy exegesis re: kosmos meaning the environment in John 3:16.	2004-03-31

I plan to follow my local Christian bookseller's advice as soon as possible: &quot;This book needs to be read and reread&quot;.  The reason for this is that it is so easy to become complacent about sin and sins.  Praise God for Puritan literature such as this!<br />Owen's first General Rule (p84) is absolutely essential: &quot;Be sure to get an interest in Christ if you intend to mortify any sin.&quot;  He is in complete agreement with Arthur Pink in The Life of Faith, (p54) who says &quot;None can possibly make any progress in the Christian life unless he first be a Christian.&quot;  Logical?  Obvious?  Not to all in our time of universalism and pluralism unfortunately.<br />One difficulty I had (and I am unable to find a page reference for it) was that Owen says that even if we have stopped acting out a sin, we have not mortified it, because its root remains.  This needs to be looked at in light of what our Lord said (Mt 5:29 NIV): &quot;If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away...&quot; and again (vs 30) &quot;And if your right eye causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away...&quot;  I know Jesus uses the word &quot;cause&quot; here, but surely what he is actually referring to is the avoidance of acting out an internal sinfulness through any part of the body.  Removal of limbs per se will not change the heart, and Jesus wasn't pretending that.  But we can see here that, in contrast to what Owen says, it is worth dealing with the symptoms of a sinful heart, regardless of the existence of the internal unmortified root.ce of the internal unmortified root.	2004-03-27

But  here's my admittedly idiosyncratic note:	On the whole I greatly enjoy TCMOS (with apologies to anyone who has been using other initials to refer to the same volume).  I have been blessed with 20/20 vision but do empathise with the comments regarding the smallness of the text.  I didn't really have a problem with the blue text either.  Nor did I mind the sections on the author's and manuscript editor's responsibilities, I guess being the novice that I am I don't mind a bit of repetition.<br />Pages 299-308, the section on compounds and hyphenation, I couldn't find a particular suffix that was of particular interest to me, namely -ia.  The most famous recent usage of this suffix is probably Dinotopia, and there is always the older dystopia and even older utopia.  I'd be happy to be corrected, but I think that the suffix means a geographical place with a certain quality.<br />I thought that with regard to referencing, a few styles could have been named, e.g. Harvard, APA, etc.<br />The coverage of Greek was impressive, including accentuation, and treatment of accents with diphthongs and initial uncials.<br />I did find that the treatment of capitalisation of heaven and hell and other \\"...divine dwelling places, ideal states, places of divine punishment...\\" to be quite value-laden.  The criteria for capitalisation is quite unclear, but it appears to be based around opinions of whether the place actually exists or not.  For a feel on whether I believe in heaven and hell myself, it may be best to see my other reviews.  I must admit that it does feel funny using capitals for them here, so I haven't.  It's probably enough to say that if some of our seminaries are using TCMOS they may wish to put a sticky note in this page (352; 8.117).	2004-03-25

Just a few points:<br />This dictionary is intuitive, informative and aesthetically appealing.<br />Not only are the lexical entries themselves of a praiseworthy degree of clarity, the grammatical tables, diagrams and explanations to the front and back of the book are well placed and a ready reference.<br />I have used it for some years now and it has certainly grown on me.<br />My only reservations about this dictionary are:<br />1) It is weak on archaic words, the usage for which I use dictionaries most of all.  For this, I supplement my dictionary needs with the much older &quot;New Standard Illustrated Dictionary and Encyclopædia (Williams, A.M, ed, Odhams Press, undated (!)).<br />2) The phonetic symbols at the front are handy, but not always used, even in other Oxford dictionaries.  However, it is naturally important that the phonetic symbols themselves are retained.  This isn't actually a criticism of the dictionary itself, but rather a plea for inter-publishing house consistency.<br />3) In the preface, the term 'polysemous' is used.  This word is not found in the dictionary itself!<br />Despite these minor reservations, this dictionary is recommended, especially if you are coming to English as a second language (which isn't the case for myself).  It has been well worth the money.	2004-02-04

It could be presented as a children's talk at Church or in the home.  Be sure, in follow up, to go &quot;cross-country to Calvary&quot;, not forgetting the reason why Jesus came.<br />Some of the pictures looked strangely Islamic, for example the city on the way to Bethlehem has minarets and prayer towers.  The three wise men also had those prayer caps with turbans wrapped around the outside.  This is why this book got 4 stars, rather than 5.	2003-12-24

This may be a reasonable recommendation.  However, J. C. Ryle helps us to put the persecution of the English reformers in a relatively modern context.  Pumpkinhead that I am (as opposed to Potatohead), I would probably be better off with the new updated and expanded edition of Foxe's Book of Martyrs, because the archaic English has been rewritten by Harold J. Chadwick (ISBN 0-88270-672-1).<br />On the topic of the above-stated &quot;modern context&quot; of J. C. Ryle (circa 1880 - I wish Banner of Truth would put the original publication date), he often predicts a turning back by the Church of England to the ways of Rome.  We, with the the luxury of hindsight, can see that to some extent this has happened, but far more damaging has been the disastrous assault of liberalism.<br />I agree with Ryle wholeheartedly, that the blood of the martyrs should never be forgotten.<br />Thoroughly enjoyable, but unfortunately only 4 stars as (1) I agree with Potatohead's criticisms on the over-use of Fox(e), and (2) There is no index!	2003-12-18

Just a few points...<br />The second edition of this volume (2003) has been fine tuned and, in my opinion, improved.<br />Personally I found it helpful to copy and adapt the diagrams on how to construct arguments, with blank, fill-in boxes for trialling different concepts.  Please note, however, that the &quot;acknowledgement and response&quot; (i.e. acknowledgement and response to exceptions to rules, seemingly opposing evidence, etc) part of the &quot;claim, evidence, warrant, reason&quot; diagram should be linked with dual-direction arrows to each other part of the argument.  This is the case because an acknowledgement and response may be required for any part of the argument process.  The authors make this clear themselves in the text, but it is not so clear in the diagram.<br />I found the bibliographical pointers at the back of the book to be relevant, up to date and of great assistance to anyone about to embark on a lengthy and challenging research project.<br />For those wishing to expand their knowledge on how to construct arguments, Williams and Colomb have also written &quot;The Craft of Argument&quot; which is now also in its second edition (2003).  There is some degree of repetition here, but it is well worthwhile learning to firmly ground your arguments.<br />I particularly liked the tip (in the volume at hand) about placing a warrant first, which a hostile audience is likely to accept.  Then moving to specifics which will cause your reader some real cognitive dissonance!	2003-12-11

Books	1	47	80	N	N	An inadequate treatment of God's grace	I would like to thank greggilbert3 who wrote a magnificent review of this book and has clearly set out what grace really is about.  You'd need to scroll back a few pages to see it.<br />Without wishing to repeat greggilbert3, biblical grace is about God's redemptive plan and forgiveness of unworthy sinners.  It has nothing to do with the aspirations of people.  Whilst \\"tolerance\\" may be a good thing per se (in the spirit that tolerance and \\"graceful\\" are rightly parts of the proper imitation of Christ), tolerance does not equal biblical grace.  Throughout, Yancey appears to be speaking against fundamentalists in this book.  He claims that grace is simply to lose one's intolerant ways.  This is nothing short of a dis-grace.  To change the meaning of grace away from the biblical standard in such a way is a tragic symptom of the modern watering-down of the Gospel.  Naturally anyone who is a fan of Yancey's will not agree with this and will probably give me an 'unhelpful' vote.  But just slow down and have a think about it in the light of the full history of Christian thought on the subject.<br />I, for one, prefer to stick with certain publishers I know I can trust: Banner of Truth, Evangelical Press, Christian Focus and Covenanter Press.	2003-11-16
US	38328110	R36LI022QGFD3V	080542010X	750774384	Theology of the Reformers	Books	4	43	43	N	N	A great look at four heroes of the faith	Timothy George is founding dean and professor at Beeson Divinity School.  He has also been a pastor and editor of numerous Christian magazines.  Currently he is executive editor of Christianity Today.<br /> It was a refreshing change to read Theology of the Reformers.  George comes to the subject as a Christian.  He does not fudge difficulties presented to believers, but, as we shall see, seeks to assist in our growing in faith and knowledge of God through the reformers.<br /> George moves from the familiar to the unfamiliar in that most theological students have read biographies of Luther, Zwingli and Calvin, but probably not Menno Simons.  The chapter on Menno Simons, then, is couched in a familiar setting which presented me with some quite new and challenging material.<br /> The basic aim of this book is to bring out the emphases in the theologies of these four reformers.  In being faithful to this aim, George has assisted in breaking down a number of myths commonly held about the reformers.  For example, rather than Calvin being a melancholic and unemotional theologian, he is shown as a pastor who (page 212) \\"...was frequently called on to counsel those Protestants who had been imprisoned for their faith and who often faced imminent martyrdom.\\"  A quick scan of the footnotes between pages 238 and 246 will show that Calvin greatly drew on the Pastoral Epistles to shape his theology.<br /> The key phrase used in the four main biographical chapter headings are something that won't easily be forgotten by most readers: \\"Yearning for Grace: Martin Luther\\"; \\"Something Bold for God: Huldrych Zwingli\\"; \\"Glory unto God: John Calvin\\"; and \\"No Other Foundation: Menno Simons\\".  These chapter headings are tied in with major threads of each of the respective reformer's theologies, and could be used as mnemonics for subsequent reflection.<br /> All four reformers are presented in a sympathetic light.  However, George doesn't shirk from showing the reformers belligerently holding on to their divisive approaches to the sacraments, when compromise (or at least temporary concession) may have been better for the church at large.  Whilst not misrepresenting the unique perspectives of each reformer's viewpoint nor espousing a \\"facile ecumenism\\" (page 316) George proposes a way forward of sorts in his final chapter The Abiding Validity of Reformation Theology namely, to hold to the essentials but continue to promote the importance of the sacraments.<br /> Regarding this final chapter, Baker (Baker, J.W. (1991)  Theology of the Reformers (Book Review).  Church History  60, 387-389.) asserts that George \\"...may have exceeded the reach of his study\\".  I do not agree with this statement for the following reasons: first, given the overall fine quality of the book and George's extensive experience in the pulpit, lecture hall and editor's desk, he is qualified to provide guidance in applying the knowledge he has gleaned from the reformers discussed; second, given the importance of the topic (i.e. the way forward for unity among Christians) it is warranted that George contributes to resolving the schisms that past doctrinal differences have caused.<br /> George's description of the disagreement between Luther and Zwingli (along with a number of associates) at Marburg was quite moving.  He brings home to me the lasting importance of unity within the Christian church and the need for flexibility in the face of military backlash (cf Ecclesiastes 3:1-8).<br /> Should this book have been aimed at theological students, it seems odd that German, Swiss, Dutch and Latin phrases are documented so precisely whilst New Testament Greek (a language of considerable usage by three out of four of the reformers studied) is only touched on thrice (pages 241, 293 and 257), and then only as transliterations.  On page 70 George points to a \\"Greek verb\\", but fails to mention which verb he is referring to.  On the other hand, a sound knowledge of Latin seemed to be assumed by the author throughout.  In many theological colleges, such as BCV (Australia), Latin is not taught, but Biblical Greek is.  For this reason it seems hard to justify \\"ordo salutis\\", for example, not being mentioned in the glossary, nor explained in the passage (page 270).  It would be helpful to have a copy of Muller's Dictionary of Latin and Greek Theological Terms handy when reading a book such as this (Muller, R.A. (1985) Dictionary of Latin and Greek Theological Terms: Drawn Principally from Protestant Scholastic Theology. Grand Rapids: Baker Books).<br /> Further to the level the book is pitched at, note that in Baker's review of this book he says (in connection with his usage of the book for an undergraduate Reformation history class) \\"...it was clearly a challenging text for some of them\\".  So, if it is pitched at a high level, why all these other European languages and so little Greek?<br /> Perhaps a good introduction to the subject would be to read McGrath's Reformation Thought first (McGrath, A.E. (1988) Reformation Thought: An Introduction. Oxford: Basil Blackwell).  Similarly sized, it takes a more thematic/topical approach than George's, which is more biographical.  McGrath has a similar sized glossary, but it includes less non-English words.  It is interesting that McGrath only mentions Menno Simons twice in his book.  This is not to say that George could be criticised for placing the obscure Menno Simons next to the renowned Luther, Zwingli and Calvin.  As I noted previously, there is value in moving from the familiar to the unfamiliar.  As is the case with reformation studies, and doubtlessly so many other historical subjects, the amount of repetition in what is published is enormous.  The chapter on Menno Simons is a welcome addition.<br /> There is a need for this book in that short biographies are used to explain reformation theology, which may otherwise be quite dry to the new reader.  George certainly achieves his aims in this book.  The lives and theologies of the four reformers are well elucidated.  It is well written, easy reading, yet deep enough and applicable to modern thought and practice (I say this in connection with the discussion on the Marburg Colloquy above).he author throughout.
