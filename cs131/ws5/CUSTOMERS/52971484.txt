Here is a family with 10 kids, the father is an alcoholic, the family is always living on the edge, and the mother is forced to get by writing jingles for contests.  It's quite possible to imagine that life with this group was a mixture of good and bad, and that it wasn't all awful.  But, its hard to imagine that it was just so relentlessly great.<br /><br />This book has the feel of a children's book.  It's a good \\"young adult\\" level title, but as an adult I felt that it was just a little too cute.	2005-10-11

While \\"On the Run: A Mafia Childhood\\" is an entertaining read, it also raises several serious issues.<br /><br />On one level it is a great antidote to the \\"Sopranos\\", \\"The Godfather\\", \\"Wiseguy\\" and all the TV, movies and literature that expose, yet tangentially glorify organized crime.  Organized crime, as experienced by the Hill family, was a family life with Dad going in and out of jail.  Kids being surrounded by drug abusing, sexually irresponsible adults.  Kids living with no sense of security or continuity.  The criminals were just drug abusing, self-centered low-lifes.  Yeah, they flashed cash, and were generous when they had money, and people feared them, but it was all about immediate personal gratification.<br /><br />On another level, the serious questions raised are about the witness protection program.  While it may have allowed prosecutors to use Henry Hill as a witness, it totally destroyed the continuity in the lives of his children who were constantly being yanked from one place to another, unable to tell the truth, unable to continue friendships, unable to have anything resembling a normal childhood.<br /><br />Henry Hill didn't change when he went into witness protection.  He was still a lying, theiving, violent, thug with a severe drug and drinking problem.  Given a new background and government protection was like a free pass to do the same things he'd been doing without consequence to himself.<br /><br />The now adult children make one question whether the witness protection program is ever a good idea.  And, if it is, if it is fair to take the family into it.<br /><br />Gregg and Gina Hill are to be commended for managing to grow up into productive apparently well-adjusted adults.  Interestingly, they come across as remarkably balanced; this is not a whining account of a dysfuntional family.  As dysfunctional as this family was, Gregg and Gina Hill come across as remarkably normal and devoid of self-pity.	2005-10-11

Based on the subject matter, I would never have picked out this book, but a co-worker recommended it, and I do love a good nonfiction story if it is told well no matter what the subject.<br /><br />This book did not disappoint.  It takes the reader into the unique world of men (and a few women) who do diving into ship wrecks.  Some of them are looking for booty, but some of them are motivated by a deep curiousity about the lives of the people who went down on the ships.  How they prepared and counteracted the dangers was riveting.  In many respects the book reminded me (as it has others) of the Jon Krakauer book about Mt. Everest.  There do seem to be a lot of parallels between these deep sea divers and the people who climb extreme peaks.<br /><br />I am very interested in history and the process of historical research.  In this case, the historical record clearly showed an outcome for this missing U-Boat, and the historical record turned out to be wrong.  These men, were not only physically daring, but they were intrepid in tracking down and digging through primary source materials until they found the truth.  \\"Shadow Divers\\" is a brilliant illustration of uncovering historical truth.  This would make an excellent book for a graduate school class in historical methods or philosophy of history.  It demonstrates how a \\"fact\\" is not always a fact, how wrong information can become history and how difficult it can be to ferret out the truth.<br /><br />\\"Shadow Divers\\" reads like a mystery novel.  I couldn't put it down and found myself totally absorbed into the world of deep sea diving, the lives of the men, the details of the historical research, and the history of the U-Boat.	2005-07-10

Google Joe Eszterhas and you'll find a Slate article that lists all the good parts in this book.  It will enable you to find out the stuff that has people talking about the \\"revelations\\" while not actually having to read this annoying, sleazy pile of goo masquerading as a memoir.<br /><br />I am not a fan of books that say \\"I was a big sleazy jerk and it was so amusing, but I'm not anymore.\\"  After a while it gets under my skin and just makes me feel like I want to take a bath, and that's how this book is.  His bragging about the women he slept with, complete with the details is about as low as you can go.  Whatever happened to the idea that a gentleman never tells?<br /><br />This book has no real narrative or structure.  It jumps back and forth between the authors childhood and his experience in Hollywood.  It is also divided into little mini stories that run about a page and a half.  Some of them are amusing, some are not.  After a while it seems like the book is being written for an MTV attention span - like a lot of current movies - with nothing being developed.  It started to feel flat and uninvolving.<br /><br />So why give it three stars?  Well, it does offer some insight into hollywood and does provide some interesting stories which others have noted.  If you like Hollywood tell-alls, and don't mind the narrative structure, you might enjoy this book.  I didn't.	2005-06-26

He manages to cover modern Montana, Easter Island, Mayan Civilization, the Netherlands, ancient Vikings, Modern China,  and a host of other societies.  He discusses the impact of man's actions on the environment, and the impact of the resultant environmental degradation on human societies.<br /><br />At the same time as he discusses the findings of archaeologists and historians, he analyzes the scientific factors, and evaluates the various levels of political response.  He believes strongly that people can choose how to respond to environmental degradation, and death or survival results from those choices.<br /><br />The last chapter brings together all the identified causes of societal collapse and argues that we can make a difference, but we must rise to the challenge.  And, he makes clear how globalization prevents us from being able to see societies in isolation.<br /><br />This book is a dense read, and it is packed with details about each of the societies discussed.  The last two chapters are more of a political tract.<br /><br />I did not find every chapter to be equally enthralling.  And, I'm certain that the attempt to fit the information into the thesis probably leaves a lot for experts in the history of each of the covered socities to argue with.  Any book that attempts to weave together such a range of subject matter is going to be rife with overgeneralization.  Nonetheless, this book is immensely thought provoking.<br /><br />For me, this book did not read as compellingly as \\"Guns, Germs and Steel.\\"  Nonetheless, it is a remarkable book.  Highly recommended.	2005-06-25

Here and Now: Conductor (Book & CD)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Unique Arrangements, Playable but Challenging	I have a full big band that meets at my home once a week to rehearse and occassionally performs in the LA area.  We are always looking for material to perform.  I bought this entire set of books.<br /><br />On the whole the arrangements are very good.  They have lots of counterparts, and are more modern than much of the traditional swing band repertoire that we play (Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, Glenn Miller, Harry James, Tommy Dorsey, Duke Ellington, Count Basie type arrangements).  Our favorites in this collection are I Had the Craziest Dream which has a great trumpet solo, Forty-Second Street, We're in the Money and Jeepers Creepers.  Not every arrangement is that much fun to play though, for instance I don't care for the arrangement of \\"At Last.\\"<br /><br />This book, which is the score, comes with a CD with the George Roumanis Big Band.  Our band has found the CD useful to hear how the songs should be played.  However, we are split about the quality of the CD.  I feel that the playing on the CD is lackluster and a bit sloppy, but other members of the band think it is great.<br /><br />I would not recommend this collection for the CD (which is out of print as a standalone product), but I would definitely recommend this set of charts if you are looking for a repertoire for a swing band.	2005-06-19

After quite a bit of research we learned about racing greyhounds.  We ended up acquiring two of them.  Then we got a house and had three.  The original two got old and passed away and we now own our fourth and fifth.  Greyhounds can be kind of addicting.<br /><br />I've read pretty much every book ever written on Greyhounds and one time or another, and have searched the web extensively.  When greyhound adoption first became popular Branigan's book was the only published reliable source.  Since then other good books have been written, but I still think anyone interested in greyhounds should start here.<br /><br />The book provides good advice on dealing with the greyhound when you first get it home and get it accustomed to living in a house.  However, I'm not a big fan of crating my dogs.  In our home we have actually made the dogs their own area where we sometimes confine them, although it is more of an in-house kennel complete with couch dog beds and doggy door (and windows for squirrel watching).  They do actually like having some degree of confinement, and Branigan is correct in suggesting that the dog needs time to adjust and a degree of confinement.  After all, they lived in a crate until they came to the house.<br /><br />She also provides, as others have noted, quite a bit of good medical information.  Not only is the thyroid information important, but I have spoken with every vet about the greyhound's sensitivity to anesthesia.<br /><br />Every greyhound owner, or anyone thinking about owning a greyhound, should read this book.	2005-06-19

This is one of several, incredibly complete biographies that he has written.<br /><br />At 700 plus pages this is an incredibly long book.  Unfortunately it is an uneven read.  I became progressively less interested in the book as I went along; however, it was worth the effort to complete.<br /><br />The first section, which he calls the Baronial Era in banking, is fascinating, and for me it was a page-turner.  The Morgan banking house actually began as the George Peabody bank in England, and Junius Morgan was brought over from the US to be his successor.  Junius Morgan took the bank to a level far beyond where Peabody had, and then his son JP Morgan Sr. took over.  JP Morgan Sr (Pierpont) is the name most associated with Morgan banking, and he was an enormously powerful and colorful character.  This was  the infamous age of the \\"Robber Barons\\" the rise of American railroads, big steel, and the oil industry.  Pierpont was at the center of it, commanding industry while collecting art, building yachts and cavorting with women.  It makes a great story.<br /><br />Pierpont was succeeded by his son JP Morgan Jr(Jack) who headed the bank during what Chernow called the \\"Diplomatic Era\\".  The book became less interesting.  Jack was nowhere near as colorful as his father, and his reign over the bank nowhere near as autocratic.  Several other bankers, among them Dwight Morrow (father of Anne Morrow Lindbergh) were major players at the bank.  The bank played a huge role on the international stage in this era, and while it had strong ties to England (and its sister bank Morgan Grenfall) it also helped finance the rise of the Nazis, Mussolini and the nationalists in Japan.  This was also the period of the roaring twenties and the depression.  The story told in the book is not quite as gripping because it doesn't hinge on a single character, but the events impacted and the role played by the bank were enough to keep me reading with interest and occassionally complete absorption.<br /><br />The third era covered was the \\"Casino Era\\".  As a result of the Glass Steagle Act, the bank split into Morgan Guarantee and Morgan Stanley.  This section of the book also tells about the demise of Morgan Grenfall in England.  This is essentially the modern era of banking where the investment bankers at Morgan Stanley and Morgan Grenfall became involved in takeover battles and modern securities.  Morgan Guarantee became a fairly staid, and boring, commercial bank.  This section of the book had the least interesting characters.  I found it to be pretty dry. I have read several books about the various takeover battles, so this account, which was more of a survey, lacked the blood and drama of other accounts I have read.<br /><br />Finally, from the perspective of 2005, the last section of the book, covering the most recent time period, feels a bit dated.  I know more about what happened to both Morgan Guarantee and Morgan Stanley than Chernow knew when he wrote the book, so the very last few chapters felt out of date.<br /><br />Overall it was  also interesting to see the interaction between the history of the bank, and social history.  The bank originally was very \\"white shoe\\", male and protestant.  It hired its first Jewish banker in 1963.  Pierpont and Jack were quite anti-Semitic.  Yet, within its confines, the bank was also a meritocracy and afforded many of its employees entree into the upper classes.<br /><br />Although, it can be a bit of a slog at times, if you are interested in the world of banking and finance, or the history of the 19th and 20th century, this is an excellent book.est and occassionally complete absorption. <br /> <br />The third era covered was the \\"Casino Era\\".

Many books that start out as magazine articles merely feel stretched out when expanded into a book.  In the case of the Genius Factory the extra pages, and expanded treatment are well worth it.<br /><br />The book deals with three interesting and important stories, weaving them together in a first person account as the author learns more about  his subject.  The first story is the history of the eugenics movement and how the quest for more perfect people (often motivated by simplistic racist notions) led to the idea of a sperm bank that would hold the sperm of geniuses (crudely defined as Nobel prize winning scientists).  This story is filled with colorful characters such as Robert Graham - the originator of the sperm bank - the inventor of plastic eyeglass lenses, and William Shockley - one of the Nobel Prize winners who contributed sperm - winner of the Nobel Prize for inventing the transistor (he is the father of Silicon Valley and his company was the progenitor of intel).  It is also a story of racism, misguided notions of improving mankind, and a philosophy that leads to Nazism.<br /><br />The second story is the story of the families.  Plotz tracked down several of the children that resulted from the sperm bank, and he got to know the children and their parents.  He also tracked down some of the donors, and their stories are in some cases more complex and interesting than I would have imagined.  I don't want to give away too much, so I'll just say that the experience of the families and the impact of the experience is fascinating.<br /><br />The third story is the story of fertility treatments.  While this story is not as developed as the other two, as events develop, the history of fertility treatments becomes significant as it intertwines with the story of artificial insemination.<br /><br />I read this book in one sitting, and it was as compelling as any mystery.  While it is written in a playful tone, it does takes its subject seriously and observes its characters with compassion.  This is far from the most authoritative source you can find on the subjects covered, but it is highly entertaining, informative and thought-provoking.and it was as compelling as any mystery.

The first, The Other Boleyn Girl, was one of the best historical novels I've ever read.  Starting from the story of the sister of Ann Boleyn, that book told the much told story of Henry VIII from a fresh perspective.  In the process it also portrayed a piece of social history rarely revealed - the living conditions and politics of being a lady-in-waiting. As much history as I've read (I have an MA in history), this is the first time I've been exposed to that in the depth shown in the book.<br /><br />The second book, The Queens Fool, tells the story of the period between the death of Henry and the reign of Elizabeth.  Hannah, the Queens Fool, a secret jew driven from Spain by the inquisition, is the main character. The social history of the English jews who escaped the inquisition is well-portrayed, and again this is an aspect of history I knew little about - this book actually sent me scurrying to read more about it - and Gregory was quite accurate in her portrayal.  The weakness of this book is that the larger story actually involves several significant historical incidents and is not as coherent.<br /><br />This last book, The Virgin's Lover, tells its story from the perspective of Amy Robsart, the wife of Robert Dudley.  From the first page I was cringing because I know too much of this story already.  Unfortunately, the portrayal of Amy is extremely inaccurate, as is the portrayal of Elizabeth.  And, I already knew way too well what ultimately happened to Amy, which is also inaccurately portrayed.  Unlike the other two books, this one does not also have a secondary story with the details of any interesting social history.  Instead, the plot just moves along and the story focuses on the too  well-known characters.  On the whole it just didn't work for me, but after about 150 pages or so I did get caught up enough to start reading it.<br /><br />A fundamental problem in writing historical fiction is writing style and use of language.  Anything a character says is likely to be awkward.  If the language used is archaic, then the reader feels unfamiliar with it, and it probably isn't the way the character talked.  If the language used is modern, it can be grating.  Gregory tends to use a combination of both.  Sometimes the language is constructed in a way that is archaic, other times, it is highly modern and colloquial.  Sometimes her characters have bizarely anachronistic thoughts.  A character will analyze the behavior of another in what can only be modern terms, or a character like Cecil is thought of by Dudley as a kind of hero because he has a vision of a unified England (this is absurd as Dudley is attributing a nationalism to Cecil that didn't exist until centuries later, Cecil might have had a vision like that, but Dudley would never in 200 years have articulated it that way).  There is also enough 20th century slang in the dialog for it to feel stilted.  I think historical fiction writers really ought to try to write very standard, non slangy, but not forcibly archaic language.  Otherwise the language gets in the way.  Unfortunately, this language problem plagues all of Gregory's books.<br /><br />Problems aside, Gregory is one of the best living writers of historical fiction.  She knows history and uses it well (I don't necessarily fault her for departing from historian's opinions or even from the evidence).  She does write characters well, and constructs a story skilfully.  I did enjoy reading the Virgin's Lover despite its faults.  If you enjoy Gregory's other books, you'll probably enjoy this one.

But right now I'm pretty ambivalent about it.<br /><br />On the one hand I do enjoy Jane Fonda as an actress, and she comes across in this book as thoughtful and intelligent.  I also enjoyed some of the chapters.  The part about acting school reminded me of the TV program \\"Unscripted.\\" And at times I could really empathize, although she really makes you wonder about all the bad choices in men that she made.  This book is definitely deeper and more thoughtful than the typical star autobiography.<br /><br />On the other hand, after a while this book started to grate on me.  Kind of like conversation with an acquaintance who is just a bit too self-absorbed, a bit too amazed by the \\"self-knowledge\\" gained by therapy, and a bit too in love with the sound of her own voice.  It actually made me feel kind of squirmy to read it at times and I found myself picking up other books and forcing myself to return to this one.  That squirmyness felt like the kind of uncomfortableness that comes from listening too long to someone who is just a bit too intense.<br /><br />There's a lot of good in this book and some interesting insight into the roles of women, but at the same time I found this book too annoying too enjoy.	2005-05-30

However, on the whole the book doesn't amount to much, wavering between sociological analysis and how to while not actually being either.<br /><br />What is clearly stated, but somewhat hidden is that this is not a book about women \\"millionaires\\" in general.  It is based on responses to a questionaire by a group of women business owners with incomes over $100,000 and a net worth between $1 million and $25 million.  Not included at all are women professionals, women who have amassed over $1 million by working in corporations, or women who might have made their money as partners in majority male owned businesses.  It is not surprising that the women millionaires in this study have not departed much in their consumption or living habits from their middle class roots.  It's impossible to say whether his conclusions are even mildly relevant to women who might have made just as much or more money in other ways, and who may account for a larger number of women millionaires.<br /><br />There were a few observations in the book that I did find to be interesting enough that I didn't feel like I wasted my time. One observation was about how many of the millionaire women had married a type he called \\"Marginal Bob\\". (I call them losers).  I have observed this phenomenon scores of times in high achieving women, and it's the first time I've seen it documented.  Another was the chapter about women who came from dysfunctional families but who were still quite successful.<br /><br />To me the book felt like fairly pedestrian (and not very well written) how-to advice cloaked in the pretense of scientific investigation.  At least the advice is to be frugal, don't overspend, be supportive of others, pick business opportunities based on types of businesses that actually make money, be persistant, etc.  At least the book doesn't pretend there is a simple overnight way to be a millionaire.  I would find a meaningful empirical study of successful women to be far more interesting. I would have also preferred if he had been more straightforward about what he was really studying.  I picked this book up and bought it off the remainder table, and I'm not surprised it ended up there.  It just isn't very good.  At least it isn't dispensing bad advice and it does have some interesting nuggets.simple overnight way to be a millionaire.

As a child my mother would always say that lobster was the most festive meal.  We didn't have it often, but emotionally it took on great significance.<br /><br />That's why I picked up this book to read.  It also happens that I love to read natural history, travel stories, and non fiction essays.  \\"Secret Life of Lobsters\\" did not disappoint.  Others have mentioned John McPhee, and this book certainly evokes his writing.  It intertwines the lives of the fishermen, the ecology and behavior of lobsters, and the lives of the scientists who study the lobsters.  It reads with the suspense and pull of a detective novel.  My only criticism is that it does not follow a linear chronology and involves a myriad of characters; at time the threads become hard to follow.<br /><br />Someone criticized this book for being pro-industry propaganda.  I seriously disagree.  Yes, the government scientists are portrayed as basing their decisions on prejudice and a lack of information.  I personally spent 10 years in the government, 5 of them as an attorney for the Department of the Interior, and I think the portrayal of the government scientists is pretty accurate.  I do think though that it's unlikely that all lobster fishermen are quite as thoughtful about conservation or as scrupulous as the protagonists in this book.  Overall though I think this book is a great read, and if you like natural history books you will not be disappointed.	2005-05-22

The characters thus speak a dialog that is at best a reconstruction by Eichenwald.  It turns the story more into a novelized account than nonfiction.  It also seems that this account does whitewash Lay a bit, completely lets Vinson and Elkins off the hook, minimizes the role of Arther Andersen and glosses over the story of the international division.  From the perspective of depth, and probably accuracy, it seems that \\"The Smartest Guys in the Room\\" is the better book.<br /><br />However, I'm reading these books as a corporate lawyer by training and experience, and it seems to me that \\"The Smartest Guys in the Room\\" might be a bit too technical to be entertaining for non-lawyers and non-accountants.  \\"Fools\\" is quite accessible and would probably be entertaining for readers who enjoy thrillers with business subject matter.  I think it is overall accurate enough to give a pretty good picture of what happened at Enron.  So while, on close examination I think better technical accounts have been written, \\"Conspiracy of Fools\\" is a gripping story and well worth reading.	2005-04-17

Let's get this straight - there is no way, no how the NSA had anything to do with training this guy to be a so-called economic hit man.  The phenomenom he describes no doubt exists, in the sense that big public utility projects financed by international banks can result in serious negative consequences for underdeveloped nations while lining the pockets of engineering firms.  And the US policy in oil countries has been an unmitigated disaster (regardless of what you think of the Iraq war if our diplomacy had been successful we wouldn't be fighting it).  But this secret 007 world of self-conscious economic hit men is a deranged fantasy.<br /><br />Sorry folks, those of you who love byzantine conspiracy theories, it just isn't so.  The NSA sits in a big nondescript building in Washington and engages in technological spying.  Anything that has to do with human intelligence is the province of the CIA.<br /><br />Since the book starts with a story that is utterly preposterous and inaccurate, and since this delusion is the foundation of everything that follows, it's hard not to find the entire thing annoying.<br /><br />Part of what made me queasy is that there are truthful observations amid the nonsense.  There is plenty that is reprehensible in the \\"corporatocracy\\" and in US involvement in foreign affairs.  However, the reality is much more complex and shaded in hues of grey than Perkins' story.  The book further inspires queasy feelings because the author freely admits many instances of dishonesty and duplicitous dealing while maintaining a stance of moral superiority.  This book made me feel bathed in egotistical slime.	2005-03-22

The writing style is breezy.  The book can either be seen as easy to read due to the conversational prose, or hard to read due to its lack of a linear timeline and assumption of a fair amount of knowledge on the part of the reader.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book very much because I found it to be a provocative series of pieces from a knowledgeable author.  Many of the essays felt like counterfactual arguments - \\"What if the plague had not occurred - how would it have affected women?\\"  \\"What if the plague had not occurred - how would it have affected the legal system?\\"  \\"What if the plague had not occurred - how would it have affected _____(fill in the blank - Jews, finance, politics, scholarship, land ownership . . .)\\"  At times I found the analysis absurdly reductionist as in the discussions of land ownership, law or scholarship.  At other times I found the analysis to be so provocative as to be embarassed for the author, as in the discussion of the possibility of the plague being started by something from outer space.  Overall I felt as though (I too bought it in the airport) I were being accompanied on the plane flight by a gifted raconteur with great knowledge and fascinating ideas who at times bordered on the edge of being a crackpot.<br /><br />I enjoyed it.  If you are interested in the middle ages, the interplay between biology and history, or just love to read good essays, I think you will too.  If you are looking for a structured historical narrative, solid scholarship (Cantor is a scholar but it is exhibited only tangentially in this book) or a detailed account of the plague or the middle ages, this isn't the book.	2005-01-29

I've heard many of what people in AA call &quot;drunkalogues&quot;, and I've read many books and seen many movies that show the depravity of alcoholism and addiction.  After a while the stories have a sameness that is boring.  Unfortunately, Dry barely rises to the level of being better than a drunkalogue.  The end of the book is affecting, Burroughs is a funny writer and much of the book is entertaining, but the story just isn't that interesting, and the book didn't leave me feeling that the insight the author acquired was all that deep.	2003-08-04

How could I resist?  In 1973 and 1974 fresh out of college my first \\"real\\" job was as an Intelligence Operations Specialist at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.  Armed with all kinds of fancy clearances, I sifted through reams of roll paper teletypes from the CIA and DIA to create a daily briefing for Fred Ikle (then head of ACDA) John Lehman (Deputy) and the Assistant Directors (like Amron Katz - a character in this book).  The intelligence was actually incredibly boring and banal.  Ikle used to complain that the morning briefing was pathetic next to the news from the Washington Post and NY Times.  It might have been banal but it was all very \\"important\\" and secretive with silly code names for special clearances. The mere existence of satellites was called the \\"fact of\\" and was classified Top Secret.  They had regular meetings for about five years before they decided to downgrade it to Confidential, and it took another ten years to declassify it.  The National Intelligence Estimates (which Taubman mentions but doesn't explain) were rediculously out of sync with the \\"raw\\" intelligence we got every day.  The \\"raw\\" intelligence pretty clearly showed - if you actually paid attention to it - that the allegedly awesome Soviet military was pretty close to pathetic.<br />There are several very exciting stories to be told in all this.  A lot of it about political bumbling, military agendas that needed to aggrandize the struggling Soviet Union, a giant man-boy dominated environment with no place for women and a big penchant for expensive toys.<br />This book does fill in a few gaps in the espionage story that I didn't know, and it does a pretty good job of giving credit to the leadership role of Eisenhower.  However, I found it frustrating - exactly how did they manage to divert such large sums without most of Congress knowing?  How did some reporters pretty much know the whole thing?  Exactly how were they persuaded not to print the story?  What did happen to Humint?  If Humint was dormant for so many years how could it fire up so fast after 9/11?  The questions that could have made a more exciting story if examined in depth were not even asked. It seemed to me that the information in this book, if well-edited, would make a great magazine article.  However, despite it's occassionally breathless tone and offers of exposure of secrets I found it repetitive and slightly boring.

I was starved for something reasonably meaty to read having failed to bring enough books with me and having forgotten that they don't have Borders in Freeport.  I hadn't read anything by Kathleen Norris but this book looked like an interesting, thoughtful coming of age story from the era during which I went to college.<br />It seemed to start out that way.  The first few chapters were an enjoyable retelling of the author's experience at Bennington where she was the proverbial \\"fish out of water\\".  Those chapters were well written and fun to read.<br />Then she went on to tell of her time as a young woman in New York City.  Here the book derailed into more of a biography (hagiography might be a better description) of her mentor.  If I were into the politics of the small world of modern poets, this might have been interesting.  Instead, I found it laborious and not very interesting reading.  Since I work in the publishing industry (although not in New York) and have occassionally been involved in business with some of the bigger publishing companies, it might have been fun to read about the politics of the publishing world.  But this book was too narrow for that.<br />The were parts though from time to time that were interesting, and I did enjoy the first chapter.  I think this book sets the reader up for disappointed by its title and what it seems to promise on the cover.  But I think if the book were more appropriately described its audience would be very small.	2002-09-08

Of course the author is only doing it temporarily, and has resources to fall back on, so she isn't &quot;really&quot; doing it.  And sometimes the preaching overpowers the story.<br />I enjoyed reading Nickel and Dimed but also found it annoying and at times infuriating.  Other reviewers have commented on Barbara Ehrenreich's attitude and political viewpoint - inherent in much of the story is a superior attitude toward working people, for example: Why does she seem to expect everyone to be impressed when she &quot;comes out&quot; to them with who she &quot;really is?&quot;  And, why does she keep mentioning welfare reform and it's impact - not one of the people in the story seems to be coming off of welfare - the only relevance is that it's part of her ideological agenda.<br />Still, on balance,despite the artificiality of her circumstances she does have some interesting stories and insights.  Some of my executive friends would benefit from taking a few minutes to consider the impact of low wages on people's lives.  However, the ones who would benefit the most would not be interested in or likely to read a book like this.<br />One of her observations that I thought was useful is that upper middle-class teenagers no longer seem to work entry level jobs during school.  This gives them a certain narrowness in their point of view.  I remember my highschool and college years spent waiting tables, working as a clerk, and so forth.  I think that was an important part of my life experience.  For affluent teenagers this would be a good book for a civics class.	2002-07-02

While the tone of the book is at times a bit polemic, it is also informed by a passion for the music.  This makes the book far more interesting to read than a simple lifeless recitation of the facts of jazz history.  The book is actually an interesting and informative survey of the of the history of  jazz and innovation in jazz.  He also makes some very interesting points about the impact of jazz education and record companies on the recent evolution of the music.  Artists, he says, are signed too young, when they've been trained in school and not trained through &quot;paying their dues&quot;.<br />I found the book to be compelling reading.  I don't agree 100% with his assessment of certain artists and developments.  Nissenson appreciates &quot;free jazz&quot; and &quot;fusion&quot; far more than I do.  But I would definitely recommend this book to any student of jazz, or to anyone who wants to be more informed about the music.	2000-12-31

The book is both a  &quot;personal&quot; account of the Ball family ownership of slaves and a  well-researched and thoughtful history of slavery in the United States.<br />Some readers have commented that the book was difficult to read; I  thought the writing was elegant and easy to follow - much easier to digest  than academic writing.  Some readers have felt the book was superficial or  self-indulgent on the part of the writer.  I didn't find it to be either -  the winding of the story made sense and like a good plot led naturally from  one part to the next.  The research underneath the story was thorough, and  the analysis was thoughtful.	2000-09-05

It's not only a great biography  about an unusual but talented man, it's the story of a man who stood at the  divide between swing and bop, who was a cruel band leader but who nurtured  some of the great talents that followed him, who never really mastered bop  but whose vision and band format was the foundation that made bop possible.<br />Goodman was apparently a hard man to like, and this biography squarely  faces his difficult personality.  He was also a genius, and incredibly hard  working.  This book does a good job both of telling the story of Goodman's  life and the context of his music.  There are many compelling anecdotes,  and the story is engrossingly told.	2000-08-31

It's still one of the  best of its kind even though it is now pretty dated.<br />I work in a  company on the fringe of the computer industry.  Sometimes co-workers come  and ask me what to read to understand the industry.  This is the first book  I give them.  The stories in this book, how Microsoft beat IBM, how Apple  grew, etc. are the fundamental mythology of the industry.  If you work in  or near the industry you ought to read this book.  As some other reviewers  have noted, the tone will make some readers cringe a bit, but the tone is  pretty depictive of the way in which many people in the industry actually  see things.<br />The only reason I didn't give this book five stars is because  it is a bit dated.  Most of the stories have been told later and better by  others so if you've already read a lot of the books about the industry this  one will seem a bit old.  Although I do still think this book is worth  reading even if you've read the others.	2000-08-31

I've seen corporate boardrooms from up close and inside, first as an attorney with corporate clients and then as a manager  or an executive in a couple of corporations.<br />The words in this book  ring true.  While I've been fortunate to work with some really fine people,  everything in this book feels believable to me.  It's entirely consistent  with the way I imagine a corporation with an out-of-control egomaniac as  President would be run. I did for a brief period experience life in another  company that was run by a guy who specializes in selling off or shutting  down pieces of companies in order to gussy up the balance sheet for a sale.  The experience was close enough to what I experienced that I felt as if I  were really there watching while I read this book.<br />Sadly, this book is  the story of a desparate board of directors that was looking for a dramatic  step to save a very sick company.  They selected a CEO who really was not  an operationally experienced manager but who was a quick fix artist who  made the balance sheet look better by a fast sell-off of apparently  nonperforming assets, and who then would sell the company before the extent  to which it had been crippled became apparent. It's amazing that in many  ways sophisticated and experienced business people serving on corporate  boards can become so desparate that they suspend their critical judgment  and select CEOs whose appearance as fire-breathing madmen seems like the  only solution.<br />A few years ago I read Dunlap's book &quot;Mean  Business&quot; and I marvelled at the ease at which he had arrived at the  moral judgment that the only thing that mattered was return on investment  to shareholders.  What &quot;Chainsaw Al&quot; pretty clearly reveals is  that the true moral choice Dunlap made was that the only thing that matters  is the aggrandizement of Al Dunlap.<br />Every corporate director in America  ought to read this book and recognize that there is no &quot;quick  fix&quot; for a sick company.  Ailing companies need solid leadership not  self-aggrandizing maniacs.  It's not hard to identify that characters like  Dunlap are bad leaders, it is hard to identify the hard work and real  leadership necessary to fix a company in trouble.t;quick  fix&quot; for a sick company.

I've read just about every book  about Silicon Valley, the computer industry and the internet.  This book is  a good one; not one of the very best but still very good.  It is funny and  well-written (although not equal to the brilliant &quot;Liar's Poker).<br />What is best about this book is the way in which it peels back the  curtain and reveals the insanity of the VC (Venture Capital, not Viet Cong)  world.  The VC in this book invest in these ventures of Jim Clark's, not  because they are based on some kind of sound business plan, but because  Clark is involved and they are afraid to be shown as fools if the venture  makes money.<br />In some ways this book is now out-of-date.  Since the  internet &quot;bubble&quot; partially burst this spring, the VC are acting  more like the sober, responsible, analytical business people that most of  them are.  This book captures a moment in time at the height of the  Internet frenzy.<br />Some of the reviewers here seem to think that Lewis was  fawning on Jim Clark.  They need to reread the book or find their sense of  humor.  This book in a sharply sarcastic manner pointedly exposes Clark as  a promoter and not much more.	2000-08-28

While I can barely remember  details of documentaries that I saw last week, I still vividly recall  details from that documentary I saw in 1967.  When I saw this book, saw  that Parfitt had also written about the Falashas, and this was yet another  group of people who believed they held onto an ancient Jewish  tradition.<br />To my surprise this book was even better than I expected; I  couldn't put it down.  Parfitt weaves the oral tradition of the Lemba  people, historical scholarship parsed mostly from travel diaries,  anthropological observation together into a travel monologue that both  reveals a great deal about modern Africa while also tracing the Journey of  the Lemba people.  Eventually the journey he takes to find out about the  Lemba becomes more interesting the the answers he may have found.	2000-08-28

If you've read the Gates Biographies, the Larry  Ellison biography, the William Shockley Biography, the and the book about  Intel, you'll start to think this book is a stringing together of twice and  thrice told tales.<br />I did find the sections about the workings and history  of the venture capitable firms to be interesting, and the material in them  to be new - at least to me - but the rest of the book was so much a warmed  over retelling of better, deeper books it makes me think I just haven't yet  read the book on venture capitalists that those chapters came from.<br />If  you haven't read the other books I've mentioned, and you want a readable  account telling some of the big stories of the Valley, then this book is an  acceptable primer.  But, as others have noted, it just tells the  &quot;big&quot; stories and really doesn't get at what the Valley is about.	1999-12-12
