She can take a homely, unpopular, loner and create a world where she can become beautiful.<br />Myra is a 51 year old nurse who lives with her dog.  She seems satisfyed to stay that way until one of her &quot;home visits&quot;  happens to be the gorgeous, popular, sensational football player of her old high school, Chip, who by the way, never noticed that she existed, (since she was dim and unpopular)<BR>Until now....<br />This book is about two people who would have never met under normal circumstances.  A loney,solitary woman.  A man with a deadly brain tumor. But Berg allows love to enter in, hope, dreams.  And we all adore when the ugly duckling is beautiful in the eyes of the quarterback!  <br />Myra needs Chip as much as he needs her.  And even if time is limited, they take the hours they are given. <BR> <BR>Only if we could all live like that!	2003-09-02

And he is appalled, even by himself.<br />'IF ONLY SHE SAW THE MONSTERS BEHIND THE EYES'  <BR>'I AM THE DEVIL'S PLAY THING'<br />Hubert Hubert is obsessed with young girls (Nymphets) as he so elequently calls them. He is sexually attracted to Lolita most of all, and married her mother to get close to her. (Naughty boy)<BR>His thoughts are written so beautifully about the way he feels for Lolita, that the reader forgets, at times, about his perversion. How he describes her knees, her legs, her skin, the way her hair drapes over her apple fresh cheeks.  How lovely.  How wicked.<br />Hubert Hubert also lets the reader know how he feels about older women,  his 30ish wife, for instance.<br />'Being with her was like thrashing inside a decaying forest'<br />Shame on you, Hubert.<br />Vladmir Nabokov has Hubert speaking in third person through some of the book...because Hubert cannot  believe who he has become or maybe has always been or will never be.<br />He knows his thoughts and desires are wrong, but he does not stop them, cannot, will not, for he is the \\"Devil's Plaything. A Monster.\\" <br />Hubert trys to be the doting step-father, giving Lolita what she wants, getting involved in school, protecting her from the big bad world.<BR>But he forgets one thing....<BR>He doesn't protect her from Hubert Hubert. <br />He kills a horrible creature in the book a bit like himself...and in killing this devil...kills himself too...notphysically but metaphorically.<br />There is no way that Nabokov could have written this book without thinking the same thoughts as Hubert Hubert...it does make the reader wonder.<br />Note- one of the best books I have ever read.  So beautiful- So musical- So lyrical--- And yet ghastly and horrid at the same time.	2003-08-25

Elizabeth Berg flips the tables with... \\"Say When\\"   She uses a male narrative, which I don't believe she has done before.

I'll have her Christmas.'<br />Griffin crys, begs her back, swears at her, hates her, begs her back.<br />Berg has a gift of taking a situation like splitting up or divorce and allows the reader to find likable qualities in both parties...Even the one having the affair. <BR>The reader says to themselves...\\"Well, I can understand why she is doing this or that.\\"<br />Griffin goes through some changes himself, realizing that he is flawed also.  And rather than make Ellen suffer for her infidelity and hate her choices, he forgives her.<br />Sometimes drastic events make us better people, even our marriages can become stronger.<br />Berg once again proves she is capable of pulling us into the world she creates.  And even when the world is imperfect, we still want to be there.  <br />As for me, I return to Berg as often as possible.  She is one of us!!!!	2003-07-19

It is about dealing with the past.  It is about the relationship between Kathleen and Joyce, who have more in common than the love of walking.  <br />The 20 year difference between Kathleen and Joyce is quite insignificant...what is signigicant is that they listen to one another without judging. They tell one another deep, hidden secrets...<br />'My child died and it's my fault. I had an affair. I had one too.<br />I have cancer.'<br />&quot;Good Harbor is about two women who met at the right time.

Thank you for books.  Thank you for my garden, for the trees, for a perfumed night.  Thank you for Joyce.<br />When you see two women walking, talking, laughing, Nike's hitting the pavement at a good speed...they are probably revealing the most unbelievable secrets about one another...they are probably saving the world.<br />Thank you for girlfriends and long walks....We are indeed one another's therapy!

I like the way her words taste, the texture, the sweetness...She is like a chocolate chip cookie.<br />&quot;Open House&quot; is a book about surviving, even when your world is falling apart.  It is about going on when you don't want to.  It is about how the unexpected can come into your life and be so darn sweeeet!<br />Sam's jerk of a husband wants to split, get a divorce, shack up with some other woman.<br />'Why? What did I do?  I'll fix better dinners.  I'll lose a few pounds.  I'll change.'  Sam pleads.<br />Then in the next breath Sam is screaming...<br />'I haaaate you.  I haaate you soooo bad.'<br />Sam proceeds to spend mega bucks at Tiffiny's.  After all HE deserves a little something, a little pain, a lot of pain.<br />'Yes, I'll take the china for eight.  Ofcourse throw in the diamond braclet too. Oh hell, what else do you have?'<br /> But this doesn't make Sam feel much better.  Maybe killing him would. Then he could feel what Sam was feeling. SICK.  SICK.  SICK.<br />BUT&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />Many times great pain carves us into better people, more open people.  Her jerk of a husband opened Sam's entire being until she blossomed and even found somebody quite unusual.

I give &quot;Pull of the Moon&quot; 5 stars, not because it has the content of a pulitzer, but because Berg's insight and observation of the human animal(WOMAN) is so acutely presise that my insides jumped, laughed and cryed all at the same time.<br />Nan, a 50 year old woman runs away from home (haven't we all wanted to do that!?) Now, tell the truth!  In leaving she finds herself, who she once was...a 60s chick, a love child. <br />I was lost but now I'm found. <br />&quot;I once was a wild, beating thing,&quot; She says.  Men looked at me wondering if they could get me.  Now they see me as a number.  An old gal pushing a grocery cart.  It scares the hell out of me, this new thing.  Me&quot;<br />Nan writes to Martin, her husband, from Minneapolis, Arizona, hotel rooms, the woods, wherever.  <br />&quot;Dear Martin,  This is something I had to do.  I need to be alone to sort things out.  Sort me out.&quot;<br />Nan smells the roses, literally.  She takes the time to talk to people sitting on porches, a misfit in a cafe.  She sleeps in the woods.  One of her greatest fears.<br />&quot;I don't know why.  I had to do this.&quot;  She says.  &quot;It goes beyond fear.  I am fed up with being afraid.&quot;  <br />I feel that every women in the universe (at one point in their lives) want to leave, run, exist again, be counted, go back in time.<br />&quot;I walked into a supermarket, Martin, and I had not idea what I liked.  Can you believe that?  I honestly didn't know.  I even lost that.&quot;<br />&quot;Pull of the Moon&quot; is Berg's Shining Star.  It is her gift to us.  She writes what women want to say or do or be.  She says it for all of us. And for a moment...we are the characters she creates. <br />Note...I listened to this book on tape.  I recommend this highly as you will feel the words with more depth.  The reader, Barbara Carruso is superb.	2003-05-27

It has deep messages about war, domestic abuse, childhood scars and releasing our expectations about how we believe the world is supposed to be.<br />Five women brought together because of their love of books.  All uniquely different but very much the same. You'll adore every one of them and sometimes dislike them too and say aloud \\"That is Me!\\" Or \\"I know somebody like her!\\"<br />But mostly, you'll not want to leave there lives...because you were in the book-club too...sprawed out on the oriental rug, sipping merlot, and eating warm toffee pie.<br />You were there...One of the members of \\"AHEB\\" <BR> and Slip, Merit, Kari, Audrey, and Faith were your friends too.<br />Then you'll close the book and probably miss all of them!	2003-04-09

I love how Hamilton does this, as in the \\"Book of Ruth\\"  It really allows the reader to understand the characters more clearly.<br />I enjoy dance and adored Balanchine, so I found the story line centered around the dance world very interesting. I wonder if Hamilton danced once herself or just did her homework on this one. <br />The story has been woven with family situations, death, dreams, sexual desires (some we may never experience), youth, middle-age, and finally, in the end, <BR>realizing that sometimes what we have is enough...<br />Love, love, love Hamilton, the messages she sends, Her tenderness, Her ability to allow hope to seep through all of her stories.

It doesn't matter what you think about Sylvia Plath; her suicides, dependence on Ted Hughes, the relationship she had with her mother, her poems about \\"Daddy, the very depth of the darkness she held inside.  It doesn't matter a damn.  What matters is the writing, the beauty of the words, the music in her voice.<br />\\"The Collected Poems\\"  won the Pulitzer.  Some may disagree with this choice, but what do they know.  Sylvia was a genius.<br />The poems are from 1956-1963...<br />\\"Southern Sunrise\\" 1956<br />SP uses the imagery of color- lemon,mango, peach, pinapple barked, green crescent of palms, quartz clear, blue drench, red watermelon sun.  One can see she was happy when she wrote this poem. (Probably just met Ted)<br /><br />\\"Fiesta Melons\\" 1956<br />Bright green and thumpable/Laced over With stripes/<br />Of turtle-dark green/Choose an egg shape/ a world shape/<br />Bowl one homeward to taste/ in the whitehot noon<br />I find it interesting how much SP's poems reveal about her state of mind as she wrote them.  One can observe the progression of depression, her troubled marriage and lonliness, especially in the later poems 1960-63...<br />\\"Tulips\\" 1961<br />I am nobody/I have nothing to do with explosions.<br />I didn't want any flowers/I only wanted/to lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.<br />\\"The Rival\\" 1961(About Ted??)<br />I wake to a mausoleum; you are here/Ticking your fingers on the marble table/looking for cigarettes/Spiteful as a woman, but not so nervous/ And dying to say something unanswerable.<br />The Moon and the Yew Tree\\" 1961<br />Separated from my house by a row of headstones/ I simply cannot see where there is to get to.<br />\\"A Birthday Present\\" 1962 (SP's struggle w/depression)<br />I would have killed myself gladly that time any possible way/Now there are these veils, shimmering like curtains./<br />The diaphanous satins of a January window/White as babies' bedding and glittering with dead breath.  O ivory!<br />\\"Lesbos\\"  1962  (SP's experimentation w/ lesbianism??)<br />You say your husband is just no good to you/His Jew Mama guards his sweet sex like a pearl/You have one baby, I have two/I should sit on a rock off Cornwall and comb my hair./ I should wear tiger pants, /I should have an affair/ We should meet in another life,/ we should meet in air/ Me and you.<br />People are fascinated w/ SP, her confessional poetry, giving us a glimse into her world.

It did not hold me until the end.  I wanted to be moved and was not.<BR>  The author read the words beautifully and slow.  I adore a story put into a kind of poetic form, but it was just too much.  Some of the story line was boring, not significant. I wanted to know more about Nick, his relationship w/ Matty and less about Nicks entire family.  I found myself skipping to the next tape...and I feel guilty about this!<BR>Fowler must be a poet...because the words were fluid and colorful.  But in this case, for me at least, it did not work.

He asks her not to sleep, to remain naked and without the black silk.  He walks around her body- ...from Blue Eyes, Black Hair...<br />This image reminded me of a dog circling his prey, not knowing whether to kill it, play with it, or eat it.  The man does all of this.<br />Obsession is a sickness.  Duras sets the tone.  A room where the man and woman meet to weep, sleep, wrapping themselves in black silk and white sheets.  Two people who are lost...obsessed with one another's obsession.  Until finally...the obsession becomes one and the man and woman become the same person.<br />Note...This is my second book by Duras. I must admit, I've never read an author like her before.   The imagery is so strong that she can use less words. I feel as if I have been inside the room myself and I don't like it!	2002-10-23

Ellen's mother dies in the first couple chapters and she is left alone with her abusive,horrible father. Fortunately, he dies also (of his life/style) and Ellen begins her search for a momma. She lives w/ her momma's momma for a while which is a disaster because she is just as abusive or more than her horrible father. \\"You have your father's evil eyes,\\" her momma's momma is continually telling her.<br />Ellen lives with a mother and daughter who treat her like one of the dogs. Because after all, they are doing her a huge favor, allowing her into their home, feeding her, giving her a bed. <br />Ellen lives with her aunt who is very sweet but only wants her for the weekend. \\"I thought I was staying,\\" Ellen says. <BR>\\"Just for the weekend, dear.

The opposite of her abusive, drinkin, womenizin first husband.  Ruby tells us how Jack takes her away from all that dysfunction, promising her a decent life, caring for her, treating her like the lady she is. <BR>Jack devotes himself completely to Ruby, gives his heart to her, showing his love in unique ways.  For instance, buying her a mule!<br />He isn't the best looking man, or the smartest...but that was enough for Ruby.<br />Then there's Jack's voice. Jack is a man after my own heart.  I couldn't help thinking...this book could have just as well been called, \\"A Virtuous Man\\"<BR>40 yrs old when he sets eyes on Ruby sitting under a pecan tree...He says,  \\"now that's a girl I could marry.\\"<BR>And after those eyes meet hers, nothing is the same.  Everything afterwards begins and ends with Ruby.<br />I adored Jacks narrative, his kindness, the love he expressed to Ruby. After Ruby dies, the only thing keeping him going is wishing and hoping she comes back...laying next to him in bed, her skin touching his skin, smelling of lavender, and eating her usual dish of yogurt.<br />Gibbon's gives us other memorable characters also, like Little Fran, who is the devil dressed as a fat woman.<BR>She gives up Mavis, who is hired when Ruby dies to help around the house but mostly helps herself to orange candy and soda and breaks the toilet seat.<br />I enjoyed the book, but the 4 star rating is for Jack.

What a delicious treat!  This book was not read, but performed with heart. I found myself laughing as I walked and at times emotional enough where I needed to walk a little more deliberately.<br />Sidda is an accomplished play-wright...who happens to mention a little too much about her mother, Vivi, in an interview.  (Not the sweetest things)  Vivi is furious and will not speak to her. But Sidda continues writing and calling her.  &quot;Mama, please talk to me.&quot;  Sidda is fascinated with the &quot;Ya-Ya's&quot; wondering how their relationships have lasted so long.  Vivi gets the Ya-Ya's together and asks what she should do.  They bring Sidda a large, old, mildew smelling scrap-book called &quot;The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.&quot;<br />Now this is where it gets good.  Sidda relaxs with a cuppa tea and begins reading.  Old invitations fall out from 1942, powdery, colorless flowers are pressed inside, and secrets.  Many, many secrets.  The scrap-book reveals more than Sidda ever imagined or thought she imagined.<br />Vivi as a young, beautiful girl; skinny dipping with the other three Ya-Ya's, bathing in the sun, in love at 15, arrested with the Ya-Ya's for indecent exposure, going through a deep depression after her boyfriend dies in the war.  Sidda also learns about Vivi's own childhood dreams, disappointments, and her unbearable relationship with her mother. How the Ya-Ya's supported one another and were there for one another. <br /> Suddenly Vivi becomes real.  She becomes a person not just a mother.  She becomes the mother who had tryed the best way she knew how... to be a mother.<br />Sidda had been seeking perfection but what she found was imperfection.  And imperfection would have to be good enough.<br />&quot;Mama you told me you wanted the scrap-book back.  So here it is.&quot;<br />&quot;I wanted you back, darling.

Professor David Lurie, 52, crosses the uncrossable line when he has this affair with one of his students, Melonie, 19.   Proffessor Lurie has no remorse.  <BR>\\"I will not issue an apology which I may not be sincere of, sir.\\"  He says to the University Committee.  He is rightly fired, shunned by friends, family, and co-workers. He retreats to his daughter, Lucy, on the Eastern Cape (South Africa) where he helps on her farm and in the animal shelter disposing of unwanted dogs and cats.  He trys to be the father he never was, and once again fails.  <br />\\"If man cannot follow his instinct, he might as well be shot.\\"  He says this in a conversation with Lucy as they talk about the male dogs.  He thinks it is outragous that they are beaten when they chase the [female dog]. It is as natural for a man as it is for a dog.  You could say David is also a dog. A dog who will not change or redeem himself of past sins. A dog who can't stop chasing [female dogs].  Young ones.<br />He does not understand what is happening to him.  Until now he has been more or less indifferent to animals.  He cannot tell whether by nature he is cruel or kind.  He is simply nothing.  Just when we think David is changing, he is still simply, nothing. Indifferent and unchangable.  Although I believe he wanted to become something utterly new, he remains the same.  And in that, he loses himself, who he could have been.<br />He opens the cage door.  \\"Come\\"  he says, bends, opens his arms.  The dog wags his tail, licks his cheeks, his lips, his ears.  He does nothing to stop it.  \\"Come.\\"  he says.<BR>\\"I thought you were going to save him for another week.\\" Bev Shaw says.  \\"Are you giving him up?\\"<BR>\\"Yes, I am giving him up.\\" <BR> And David gives him up.  Gives up.  Gives up.   Damn it.  I was waiting for redemdtion, love, something tender.  But David gives us hopelessness.  Giving up on himself. \\"Yes, I am giving him up.\\"<br />What the reader gets is layers upon layers of brilliant writing, metaphor, and poetry.  \\"Disgrace\\"  is absolutely the best book I've read this year!	2002-09-08

I knew it was about twins (one with schizophrinia) and it bothered me.  I know people with the illness and damn it, it bothers me.  Because I know they will never be the people they were intended to be.  <br />But I read it anyway... finally.<BR>and loved it.  Wally Lamb is exquisitely delightful, even when dealing with something as disturbing as mental illness.  He gives us Dominick and Thomas as gifts.  Dominick is the one without the illness, but still has his own illnesses (if you know what I mean)...he is the caregiver of Thomas, the one who loves and hates Thomas, the one who is terrifyed to become Thomas. Thomas is like a child who needs to be taken under Dominick's wing, he is gentle, he is alone. <br />Wally Lamb brings the reader into the dark corners of mental illness, reveals family secrets, our own inadequacies,and gives us remarkably layered characters. The dialouge is deliciously real and believable.  <br />This book is about much more than a brother with mental illness.  It is about all of us despartely attempting to find ourselves, our roots, our purpose in a world of rough edges.<br />Towards the end...Thomas learns many things about life, love,compassion,redemption and himself.<br />How every moment in our lives somehow come together in the end...the rough edges (if we change) become polished.<br />&quot;I believe in the roundness of things.&quot;<BR>I know this much is true.	2002-09-07

I believe it was the only book we all categorized equally with \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\"  and \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\"<BR>Yes, it was that good.<br />The second time I read it was for the pure pleasure of Hegi's words.  Her powerful voice is translated through Trudi Montog, the main character.  A German girl whom happens to be a dwarf (Zwerg)  A misfit.  Who hangs from doorframes until her fingers are numb.  \\"Grow, grow!\\"  she prays to an ineffective God...why else would he create her short, stubby, ugly, and utterly despicable.<BR>But she was given a gift.  The wonderful gift of story-telling.  This will save her as humour saves the character in \\"A Beautiful Life\\"  or at least made life tolerable.<br />In the midst of Trudie's battles,  Hitler is rising.  Slowly, like a cancer spreading.  Jews are being taken from their homes, disappearing, losing their German passports, given a yellow star to wear on their chests.<BR>Nobody believes it is really happening. <BR>\\"They are only working at those camps.\\"  they say.<BR> <BR> INDIFFERENCE is worse than anything.  Indifference makes monsters grow.<br />\\"Stones From the River\\"  is about the human condition during war.  How it can sometimes turn us into animals, Intolerant of our differences.  Hating one another because of them.  <br />Who understands better than Trudie about the ugliness of being different....\\"They will find anything.  Anything to separate one from another.  Widows.  Jews.  Swergs. Madness. Hitler will find something.\\"<br />\\"Stones\\" is not an easy read.  I wanted to scream at times...WHY did you all let this happen? WHY?\\"  And at the same time...the story was so beautiful, I carry some of the sentences around like jewels to savor later.<br />In the end, Trudie accepts herself as she is...too much has already happened to feel sorry for herself now.<br />...\\"And what to end the story with.  It had to do with what to enhance and what to relinquish.  And what to embrace.\\" ...STONES	2002-07-12

I need a manicure, peticure, facial, what the hell, I need to be anywhere but here.&quot;<br />This book is about Mrs. X decked out in Gucci, Prada, and Chanel.  All dolled up with no place to go except maybe the country club or some committee meeting or shopping for the proper lavender water.  She likes giving dinner parties...<br />&quot;Take Grayer upstairs for supper tonight, Nanny, I do not want to take the chance of crumbs falling on my Italian marble tile.&quot;<br />It's about Mr. X.  The absent father who gave the sperm to Mrs. X so she could become pregnant.  The sperm was all he could spare. <BR> He's like the Wizard of Oz, standing behind gold, velvet curtains issuing layoffs, merging devisions and carrying his cell phone around like a extension of himself.  <br />It's about sweet Nanny who is hired to play with 4 year old Grayer, bring him to French lessons, piano, art class, read to him from the Wall Street Journal (HA), wipe his forehead when he's sick, and love him...<BR>because nobody else has the time.<br />Mr. and Mrs. X seem to think they are not Mr. and Mrs. X... but Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy.<br />Well let me tell ya ...  You aint no Kennedy, baby...nor will you ever be.<br />I expected a no-brainer with this book, but I found so much more.<br />Loved this line during the interview process...<br />&quot;Now she wants to know why, if I'm so fabulous, I would want to care for her child...I mean, she gave birth to it and she doesn't want to, so why should I?&quot;<br />The &quot;Nanny Diaries&quot; bring us into a world most of us (If we're lucky) haven't a clue about.  A world of hipocrosy, greed, emptiness and the grooming of monsters.<br />I, for one, was thrilled and appalled to be there...but just as happy to return to the reality of real people who acually take care of their own children!	2002-06-27

As simple as that.<br />Like revisiting a close friend.  You know, the sort of friend who brings you to a place you want to stay for a while.  The sort of friend who makes you laugh out loud and cry and makes you think about things deeply.<br />In &quot;True To Form,&quot;  Berg once again brings us into familiar ground.  It is one of those feel-good, I-know-what-you're-talking-about,I've-been-there before kind of books.  Deliciously told by 13 year old Katie, whom is absolutely believable (After all, Berg was a 13 year old teen once herself!)  or how could she write such wonderful material.<br />When Katie is talking about her best friend Cynthia, she says:<br />&quot;I am sorry to say that one of the biggest reasons we are friends is that we are sort of losers.&quot;<br />Katie may be only 13, but her insight is clear, refreshing, magical, and as girls, we can relate and identify with her...<BR>her coming of age, continual questions, relationship with girl-friends, father, and her mentor, Cherylane.<BR>  I love that her step mother, Ginger, is not ... stereo-typical ...;  But is as tender as any true mother.<br />Berg is at the top of her form with this one.

This book paints a new an unexpected picture of her.  Somebody fun, totally insecure (imagine SP being insecure), outrageously goal-oriented, quite child-like at times and sugar sweet. But her unbearable lonliness seeps in also and the depression and the loss of control. This is the SP that most of us think we know.<br />\\"Whom can I talk to?  Get advice from?  No-one.  A phychiatrist is the God of our age and I won't take advice, even if I want it.  I'll kill myself.  I am beyond help.\\"  -Jounal entry-<br />The journals begin with entries from 1950-1953...<BR>When SP was only 18-her insight, vocabulary, knowledge about the universe, and fluid sentences were evident...even then.<br />In one of her journals she describes rain as she does many times in the book---<br />\\"listening to it spurting and drenching and all the different timbers of tone and syncopation-hard maetallic.\\"<br />A cleansing of one's mind?  A small baptism for one who hates God? The washing of the soul?  We shall never know. But look for all the metaphorical images of rain in her writings. Beautiful.<br />Reading the journals-I felt deliciously naughty, as if I were invading somebody's private letters.  And I felt a sense of sister-hood with SP for the first time...as she was experimenting and despartely trying to find the right date, man, soul-mate and equal.<br />\\"I have at best three years in which to meet eligible people.\\"<br />She was only 18 or 19!  Did she know she was going to kill herself then?  <br />In an entry about Ted Hughes (her husband) she writes...<BR>\\"He is the perfect male counterpart to my own self.\\"-journal entry-<br />How wrong she was.<br />What pissed me off was SP is continually irritated about the women's role in the 50's...<BR>\\"Waking to a new world with no name, being born again, and not of woman.\\"  -journal entry-<br />But then she turns around and writes this...<BR>\\"I am at bottom, simple, credulous,feminine, and loving to be mastered.\\"<br />And this mastering she allowed Ted Hughes to do...And I hate her for it.<br />Personal stuff aside.  SP gives the reader superb advice and imformation about the writing life...<br />\\" Write.  You have seen a lot, felt deeply and your problems are universal enough to be made meaningful.

A user of the human race. Even a user of her own flesh and blood.<br />This is the story of Ingrid and Astrid.  Mother and daughter.  Master and slave. Devil and angel.<br />\\"We would not sleep on hot dry nights, my mother and I. I woke up at midnight to find her bed empty.

But she finds out she is not the woman she thought she was.  She finds out that she can not depend on anybody but herself. <BR> Nobody.<br />When her mother ends up in jail...Astrid begins her journey of foster homes.  Not the sort of homes you'd expect. These foster homes should be shut down, closed, condemned.  <BR>And the (so called adults)  should be burned at the stake.<br />Janet Finch is a poet.  White Oleander is 390 pages of pure descriptive, gorgeous, stinging, unimaginable circumstances. You must go with her, stay with her, and understand that these people are living in your city, neighborhoods, across your alley, maybe even in your house.<br />Does Ingrid redeem herself?  Does Astrid find somebody to love? Or who loves her...<br />Read the book and find out. <BR> Absorb the words.  Let them sink into your pores.  Even the chaos is a gift to the ears.	2002-05-21

The daughter remembering her mother comforting her... whispering...<BR>\\"Don't you know I will always take care of you?\\" <br />And of course.....\\"Martin's Letters to Nan\\"  Nan acually takes off, leaves everything, travels around the country to find her identity once again. <BR> She is my hero!!!  What mom and wife would acually have the nerve to do just that??!! Have we thought of it? <BR> <BR> YES.<br />Martin's letters to her are superb, hilarious, moving...<BR>I read this outloud to my husband....<br />---Let me be the one to say this first. You say, oh Martin, look at that painting! Look at it! Oh Martin, listen to the violin, Listen to it!  It's like your a culture Nazi.  I see it, Nan, I hear it, I taste it, I ... smell it, I just do not need to TALK TALK TALK TALK TALK about it!<br />My husband laughed....That's you, he said!<br />Berg's gift is capturing the ordinary and making it extraordinary...<br />The simple things,<BR> hot sun on skin, the smell of soap on fingers, the sound of a mother's voice, even the pattern of wall paper.<br />This is about me!  This is how I feel!  My husband is that way!<br />These are sentences you may utter as you read \\"Ordinary Life\\" <br /> Berg is just like us...<br />She is our girlfriend....  <BR>      <BR>Let's do lunch soon, Liz!	2002-04-08

I found my heart quickening, felt a sense of urgency;  at times I wanted to quit reading but I could not.<br />\\"I know I am strange.  I drift.  Maybe I'm smoking a cigarette, leaning on the bricks.  Somebody's talking.  Then I'm not there.  I'm a window breaking.  I'm peices of myself falling to <BR>the ground.\\" -----Nobody's Daughters------<br />First, Body takes the reader into places we don't want to go...but we go anyway...It reveals other worlds we don't want to know about...but we listen.  <br />We want to believe we live in a perfect world, but reading this book helps us crack open our little cozy cocoon....and we are forced to fly into the reality of it all.<br />Thon's prose is more like poetry...Intense and beautiful.  I could almost smell the stale cigarettes and whiskey filling my bedroom, hear the sound of ice rolling around in a glass.<br />But I am still trying to figure out if I liked the stories or not!  My suggestion....Read it and form your own opinion...Thon's voice alone is worth the trip to the book store.	2002-04-02

I must admit, I really didn't know much about Colette until I read \\"Secrets of the Flesh\\"  Only that she was some sort of genius. After all, one writer said of her....\\"There is enough beauty in ten of her lines to content a lesser writer for a lifetime.\\"<br />I found this to be true after reading this book.<br />\\"I've had enough!  I Want..I want...I want to do what I want!...I want to go on stage, to become a mime, even an actress.  I want to dance naked if I feel that a leotard...cramps my style, I want to retire to an island...or spend my time in the company of women who live by their charms..I want to write\\".....   COLETTE 1923<br />And she does......<br />Colette does it all, not giving a damn what people thought. She <BR>says,  \\"I have never been able to take interest in anything that<BR> doesn't relate to life.\\" <br />Judith Thuman did her homework!  \\"Secrets\\" is almost 500 pages long and filled with interesting details about Colette's life...for example...she weight-trained, loved food, danced naked, loved women, was not a feminist,adored cats, wrote by the light of a blue lantern, was not discreet about her sexualality, and her mother, Sido, was a huge influence on her.<br />\\"I write with my senses, with my body....all my flesh has a soul.\\"---Colette,  Retreat from Love<br />My suggestion....<br />after reading \\"Secrets of the Flesh\\" <BR> Put on some Aretha <BR>Franklin or Alisia Keys and dance naked in your living room.  If Colette did it in Public, we sure as hell can do it in our own <BR>home!	2002-03-19
