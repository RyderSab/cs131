It's just a 1984, Brave New World, Farenheit 451, Animal Farm or Clockwork Orange for kids -- I guess. It just made me want to read those books instead.<br /><br />There were many unanswered questions at the end of the book. I would have liked to have known why the community was the way it was and how it got there. How did people only see in black and white? How did they get rid of the sun? How did they grow crops if there was no sun? Why are the birth mothers considered so stupid and low, yet they're giving birth to the entire community -- therefore giving birth to stupid kids? How come Jonas isn't stupid?<br /><br />Where is he at the end? It wasn't clear. Or I'm just too dumb to read into things.  I would have liked more of a \\"fleshing out\\" of the community instead of the bare bones we are given. I'll buy anything -- just sell it to me.	2004-08-20

If anyone heard a loud explosion in the New York city area last week, it was the sound of this feminist's heart breaking.<br />It pained me because it's a very good book otherwise.<br />First of all, Lyra is just a boy in a skirt. Why did Pullman feel the need to do this? I understand being a tomboy -- but even the most beloved literary tomboys were still believable girls.  Lyra is not a believable girl. There's very little girlish about her. When she is asked to choose a toy in the later parts of the book, she chooses a doll grudgingly.<br />I think Pullman did this to get away with his treatment of women throughout the book.<br />There's a little girl at an all-male college (nothing wrong there) -- and this is never fully explained. However, the few female professors there are considered &quot;dowdyish&quot; and uninteresting and not given any time. It's this little girl around all these men. Then comes the only other female lead in the story -- and of course she's Lyra's mother and of course she's evil.<br />When a scholar asks Lyra if she would like some other little girls to play with, she wrinkles her nose and says, &quot;No.&quot;  When stuck in the camp, she seems especially dismayed that she's stuck in the all-girls dorm.  This would be fine, if she were to come to some later realization that girls are not only useful but great -- but this realization never comes. Girls and women are always on the periphery of this book.<br />There's a witch -- who just happens to send her male daemon to speak for her for most of the time. So, once again -- another male voice.  The witches are immortal. In one breath, a witch says, &quot;Flying is the most important thing to witches&quot; and also, &quot;I would have given anything to follow him to his world where I could cook and clean for him and have his babies.&quot;<br />Gag me. Normally, I wouldn't give a hoot if an author hated women or not, but this is marketed as a children's book. It's not unlike having an adventure story where the black guy always gets killed in the second act. Let's get with the 21st century.ted as a children's book.

Instead, Mawer had about a billion subplots in a relatively small book.  Very frustrating.<br />3) A passive protagonist.  The main character is this old, sterile priest who, for some reason, has ALL THESE CHICKS THROWING THEMSELVES AT HIM!!  What was so fantastic about this guy?  I couldn't tell.<br />4) Cliche love scene.  Alone in a chapel on a rainy day and the lights go out.  Gimmie a break.  When the heck does that ever happen?  And, of course, she just CAN'T restrain herself.  Bleah.<br />5) When I finally got to the end of the book -- basically cuz I just skipped the middle it was so hard to follow and dull -- the dealing with the actual gospel of Judas was very obvious.  Not to ruin the ending for anyone else, but wouldn't it have been such a better book if the gospel hadn't been treated as it had been?  If it had come to light?  What would the world-wide ramifications have been?<br />Props to Mawer for the following: very well researched.  Good description.  Beautiful writing.	2001-06-11

I've always enjoyed the idea of Studs Terkel's WORKING and fantasised about perhaps writing an updated version.

I had to take everything with the thought, &quot;Yeah, well, this was 30 years ago.&quot; Thank you John Bowe et. al.<br />It's voyeristic to read this book, yes, but it's also comforting to see people talk about their jobs with love and hate: the same mixed feelings everyone has. We do need love and work in order to be happy. If a human has something to do, s/he atleast has something to think about (good or bad).

Get on with it already!<br />Some  segments were so downright poorly written and confusing I had to go back  and read them two times to figure out what he was getting at.<br />I did like  that he wrote from a temp's view instead of a client's.  He understands  that there's a lot we'd rather be doing at work than working.  He shows how  to get around it.  It's great.	1999-01-27

In the back of the book, it has order forms for more books -- so that middle management can give them to  all junior staff and say, &quot;I understand you, dude: my office, five  o'clock.&quot;<br />If it's not just a disguised TQM book, I'm awed by the  brilliance.  If it is a disguised TQM book, I'm disgusted.  They've  infiltrated our ranks and are using our own against us.	1999-01-24

Bleah.  Talk about a bubbleheaded bimbo who's always fussing with her hair?!  When does Scully  giggle, fuss with her hair and nag Mulder all the time?<br />The story  properly freaked me out, however, and made me wish I hadn't read it right  before bed!	1999-01-04

I may even compare her to Louisa May Alcott. I was  pleasantly surprised.	1998-12-28

Amazing.<br />I was excited about reading this book; however, I found it to be incredibly difficult to read  and had to put it down midway through.  I had no idea what he was writing  about and it was hard for me to follow what was going on.	1998-12-28

He's tough and gentlemanly.<br />There's some funny  stuff in this book: very silly. The love story is cute and the heroine is  likable.<br />A must read for Zane Grey and Louis L'Amour fans.	1998-08-23

The second time I read it, after  one more heart break, I was ready to take their word for it and follow  their suggestions.	1998-08-15
US	52856063	RHFK4UH4ZPUEB	0440306329	905640701	Bloom	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Not unlike Erica Jong's books	Ms. Bloom, the main character, lives with her husband in Hawaii.  She's a  crazy, drunken manic depressive.  She bottoms out on her behavior, leaves  her husband and gets her own life.  It's the ups and downs of a beautiful  young woman in the early 80's, but speaks to woman anywhere.<br />A lot of  good philosophical stuff; I still think about it.  I still quote passages  from the book while with friends.  Ms. Dukore is a thoughtful woman.<br />I  recommend this as reading for anyone who can't get enough of &quot;The Bell  Jar,&quot; by Plath and anything by Jong.  Happy Reading!	1998-08-15

This book is different from other historical romances in that Marietta has more than one lover.  She's a real woman and Derek Hawke is such a man!I was lucky to find a used copy on the streets of New York city.<br /><br />I wish I could find some more of Jennifer Wilde's stuff (Jennifer Wilde is actually a man!  That's so weird!)	1997-08-03
