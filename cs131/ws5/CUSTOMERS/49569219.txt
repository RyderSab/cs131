When my mother read this series and raved about it I thought she was a little loony; she spoke as if she actually knew the characters in the book.  But then, I was bored and picked up Outlander and was hooked.  I LOVE THIS BOOK!  Others have picked it apart, called the charaters wooden, and the situations unrealistic.... It's fantasy people!  I fell in love with Jamie as have thousands of others, and have recommended this book to countless people.  I am, at this very moment, re-reading this series for the third time.<br /><br />And just as an aside... the 1700s are the 18th century, people.  This book does not take place in 17th century Scotland... It takes place in 18th century Scotland!	2005-06-13

No detail of these experiences is spared and a true and clear picture emerges of what it must have been like to live with this disease.<br /><br />Of particular interest to me, a student of human sexuality education, was the inclusion by the author of the survivors sexuality.  Although stricken with polio, these people did not loose their sexuality when paralysis set in and it was very refreshing to see that aspect of the experience included.<br /><br />\\"Living with polio\\" was not only an informative read, it was a well written and engaging one.  Highly Recommended!	2005-05-03

After reading \\"The Hot Zone\\" and \\"Virus Hunter\\" I moved on to \\"Scourge: the once and future threat of smallpox.\\"  Quite and interesting read, this last book proved to be.  The author is extremely knowledgeable about the subject matter and manages to keep the reader engaged for well over 200 pages.<br />The one thing these three books have in common, and the one feature I could do without is the \\"modeling\\" that come in the last chapter.  This is where the author models the outbreak of some disease (in this case smallpox, go figure) to show the reader how unprepared we are, and how virulent the disease actually is.  Although it was quaint in the first book, by the third it is tired.<br />Aside from that, I would encourage anyone with a passing interest in infectious disease or bioterrorism to take a closer look at \\"Scourge.\\"	2002-03-22

The traditional family unit, the nuclear family, is so distorted and twisted in this novel that the characters are forced to create their own family units with friends, lovers, strangers.  Truly, a novel for our time, when families come in every shape size and color, Fall on Your Knees shows you that Family, in what ever form it may take, it truly the most important and central thing in life.<br />MacDonald is a brilliant storyteller who reminds me, with her use of Magic Realism, of Isabel Allende.  Both women weave webs of mysticism and paranormal around the characters in their novels, and have broad definitions of Family.  Their works are not without tragedy or triumph, but both are presented in such a way as to lack overstated heroism.  There is nothing &quot;too special&quot; or &quot;too unusual&quot; about these tragedies and triumphs, they are simply part of life to be dealt with.	2002-02-28

After all, who is not facinated by little people, dwarves, midgets, whatever the PC term for people of short stature is today.<br />Unfortunately, this book did not live up to the Maxxim review and I came away a little disappointed.  &quot;In the Little World&quot; grew out a piece the author worte for Esquire Magazine about the LPA (Little People of America) convention that takes place every summer.  Although it does allow the reader to see what life is like for people shorter than 4'10&quot; (the LPA's definition of a dwarf), it doesn't really do a very good job of making the reader connect with them.  In fact, the book portrays them as  petty, insecure, and intolerant, rather than the &quot;regular people&quot; that they really are.<br />Perhaps I am missing the point of the book.  Perhaps the author was trying to point out that most &quot;dwarf literature&quot; takes the &quot;Big Heart Little Body&quot; approach, and that he was not going to do that.  Perhaps his intent was to show that dwarfs can be just as petty, annoying, jealous, and intolerant as every other person.  I don't know...<br />Not the best book I've ever read, but not a wasted read either.	2002-02-28

This is a macabre novel but wonderfully so, and to say that it is Gothic is an understatement!<br />The pace of the novel mirrors Stella's mental state.  Slow at first, growing slowly to a terrible crechendo, and crashing back down.  I still can't wrap my mind around the ending, and I am tempted to reread Asylum to try and figure it all out.<br />Highly recommended for fans of the Gothic!	2001-03-10

This section is so beautiful and touching that I actually wept when I read it.<br />Perhaps it is just the place I'm in at the moment, or perhaps because the emotions are so universal, but I feel a kinship to the author of &quot;To My Young Husband.&quot;  It will strike a chord with anyone who has loved and lost but can still look back with fondness and a smile.<br />I say &quot;The Way Forward is With a Broken Heart&quot; is perfect for Valentine's day and the broken hearted among us.	2001-02-02

The ending was wholly unbelievable and implausible, not to mention borderline gory and grotesque.<br />It seems to me that Harris rushed through &quot;Hannibal&quot; in order to satisfy the demands of readers and fans only to produce an inferior novel which left the devoted among us sour.<br />I would hate to think that Harris's talent has been tapped.  Hopefully, this is not the beginning of a downward spiral and that Harris has other &quot;good things&quot; in store for us.	2001-01-22

I love this book.  The author's voice is so real, so authentic, it's as if you were reading her diary.  The people and places that she describes, the smells, the views, the weight of the pack on her back, you experience it all.<br />I highly recommend this book for any woman, whether she travels or not.

The traditional Pam Houston elements are present in this novel, however I agree with the reviewer who said it was &quot;disjointed.&quot;  It felt to me as if each chapter was screaming out to be a short story.  There was very little flow through the novel to tie it up into a neat little literary package.<br />I am a fan of this author through and through, don't get me wrong.  I enjoy her writing tremendously, admire the way she spins a story, and the highly autobiographical nature of her work appeals to me a great deal. I am not maligning this book; merely saying it didn't meet my expectations, although they were probably set impossibly high.<br />The title of this review is the title of the chapter that spoke to me in the clearest voice.

However, the final chapter was a page-turner with a engaging plot, and a surprise ending.  It also provided insight into the title of the work and salvaged the entire reading experience for me.<br />My advice would be to skim everything but the last chapter.

US	49569219	R293GAA82H55KP	0345438175	737549674	Group Sex	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Uncomfortable	Having been introduced to Arensburg's work through the magnificent  &quot;Incubus,&quot; I was a little disappointed with &quot;Group  Sex.&quot;  A truly disturbing tale of a young editor and her love (?)  affair with a theatre director.<br />Although I finished the book in the  matter or two days, it was an uncomfortable read.  The main character  allows her lover to completely reform her, pulling her in and out of  distorted shapes. The main character is uncomfortable with her lover  through most of the novel, and the reader senses this.<br />Because I think  Arensburg is a gifted and talented writer, I cannot completely malign the  book.  &quot;Group Sex&quot; is a quick read, and an engaging one, although  a bit disturbing for this reader.	2000-09-13
