A. Banks. I enjoyed Minion, but I LOVED The Awakening. The battle between good &amp; evil, laced with the deadly romantic attraction between Neteru and Master Vampire was intoxicating. <br />Damali, Neteru, is coming into her own. Her birthday is nearing and so is her vulnerability to the master vampires stalking the Earth. Every demonic creature imaginable is aware of this historical event, but only the vampires have the ability to use it to their evil advantage.<br />Carlos and Damali have always shared a bond, an attraction. Carlos always felt the need to protect Damali...kind of like her guardians. But when opportunity presents itself, can the softhearted drug lord resist. Carlos gets caught up in something that even his arrogant street-wise character can't reverse. The Vampires approach Carlos with a lucrative offer. His decision and actions thereafter can shift the balance between good and evil.<br />The author delivered constant action, mental stimulation, and tweaked every human sense available. I'm twitching in anticipation for the next book. I sat in awe as I read. I'm a big vampire fan, and the urban spin that Banks weaves into this series mesmerizes me. I wish it were a weekly sitcom. When you pick The Awakening up to read, siphon off enough time to complete it because once you pick it up, you won't put it back down until . . .	2004-02-22

One Day I Saw A Black King is a wonderful story about how love and time softened two battered hearts. John King and Connie Rodgers share similar history. They were both abandoned and learned through trial and error how to survive. John lives by running from town to town extinguishing any ties he made while there. Connie runs from man to man leaving a piece of herself with each one. Now these two are slowing down. They know how to survive, but not how to live. Being with one another showed them that they do actually want some stability and maybe even love in their lives; however, for them to move forward, they must confront their pasts and deal with the pains that catapulted their flights and trauma.<br />J.D. Mason takes her time and unfolds this story. She sagaciously threads cadence, characters, and plot together and creates a searing tale of repentance, deliverance, and acceptance. I was mesmerized from the first page. The characters and story lingered in my mind long after I finished reading the book. You've got to read this book. You'll love it.	2003-10-05

Wrestled with weather or not you wanted to deal with that drama? If you haven't, you know someone who has. True Lies is an in depth voyage into the difficulty of getting involved with and loving a man who has a child, a permanent rope binding him to another woman. Margaret Johnson-Hodge opens that damn of water that often drowns the outside woman. She explores the terror of stepping into a ready-made family and the turmoil of sharing your man not just with his child, but also with his child's mother. <br />The True Lies cast of characters includes Rick, the naive, well meaning father; Gina, the young, belligerent mother; and Kanisha, the cute daughter. This cobbled together Tonka toy family is weakly built on dependence, and barely surviving on lopsided love. Enter Gina, a demure, sophisticated young woman with style and aplomb...and you've got a recipe for chronic chaos and willful war. <br />Johnson-Hodge's supple writing and colorful cadence buries us in the characters' explosive emotions and toxic relationships. She weaves a story of growth, trust, love, and disappointment. True Lies, like her other stories, is thought provoking, and mirrors the candid complications we experience in some of our own relationships.	2003-02-07

He made a promise regarding Manda that he MUST see through. Madison and Zachary are thrown together, made to depend on one another and cooperate to triumph through tumultuous situations. Consequently, just when the ominous clouds are moving scandalous secrets threaten to crumble the foundation these two strong characters built.<br />Francis Ray's writing made my heartache. I wanted to reach out and comfort Madison; to remove her from the levels of grief that were stacking on top of her. In less than 50 pages, Francis established the problem, painted the setting, and sucked me into the poignant plot. Such passion, raw emotions, and unbridled needs.<br />The sensuality...erotic passion gave me shivers. Ray eloquently writes tasteful love scenes that make you squirm. Tender scenes that are more mental and emotional than physical. Shooting electric currents of desire, she deftly builds tension and anticipation between multiple characters and in various situations.<br />Ray wrote so sensually that I closed my eyes and could feel the depth of love and contentment. I Know Who Holds Tomorrow illustrates over and over the importance of  love, honesty, and trust in any type of relationship.	2002-06-12

Love Don't Live Here Anymore is a story of the perfunctory demise of a three year marriage between Mikki and Randy... the typical successful, professionally driven products of baby boomers. Told in first person narrative through alternating chapters that are appropriately titled He/She, the story deals more with the internal, emotional battle and struggle to make sense of things, rather than how to solve the myriad of issues that arise throughout the story. As the marriage spirals downward, each partner tussles with conflicting emotions, illicit needs, and steady guilt. The plot and story line were phenomenal. It was the delivery that left a lot to be desired. <br />The interspersed psychology of marital problems was tossed in the story along with threads of dialogue that failed to engage me. Like disobedient children on punishment, we were left out of intimate interactions between key characters. We didn't get to experience the characters' actions; instead, we were told most things. The story would have a more sincere impact with more meaningful dialogue. <br />The outstanding plot suffered because of the underdeveloped story, and extremely static, one-dimensional characters. The dialogue and character interaction was limited and timid, preventing me from honestly getting involved in the story. I never really developed a reader/character connection. I felt very detached from the story and the characters. <br />I finished reading the story; enamoured with the premise, yet feeling as if I missed something. Nevertheless, it is an enjoyable story with real-life marital issues and obstacles.	2002-05-20

Jan deals with parents that are sometimes as cold as ice, with secrets so hot they could melt the sun. A spirit spills the story through loquacious narrative chronicling Jan's journey through adolescence, into womanhood, through college, during relationships, and into loss. Invariably she learns keen awareness, acceptance, and forgiveness.<br />I had a distinct appreciation for the rhythm of the story, which delved in and out of the characters' thoughts, spinning perspectives and providing lucid details through Jan's distorted puberty. The women grazing in and out of Jan's peripherals add variety, color, and perspective to the story. <br />Ms. Coburn is as lyrical as they come. Smooth, wise words slip in and out of the pages branding location, setting, and characters in your thoughts. In Meant to Be, you'll read with your ears as well as with your eyes. The words are so succulent and familiar that if you read too fast, you'll miss the clever mixtures of wisdom and sarcasm.<br />The story is engaging. The writing is mesmerizing. I only have one complaint. I abhor lengthy narrative, which reminds me of boring college lectures where you are not an active participant. Narrative is the medium through which this story is told. Consequently, had the author spun the tale without this particular narrative, the story would adopt a totally different meaning. Eventually I learned to tolerate the verbose voice leading me through each scene and thought. <br />Take your time reading this or the loud narrative will overwhelm you. This is not a speed read. Pace yourself in order to really appreciate the depth of the message, the melody of the words, and the spirit of the story.	2002-04-23

The crippling euphoria of true love is a catapult unleashing a wind storm of deceit, disappointment, disparity, and decadence that spans through three generations of lovely women not in control of their destiny. This curse begins with Cora in Book I, and plants a seed of discord that festers and explodes in her offspring. Blending opulent shades of history, Hill moves from slavery to parched freedom. <br />The transition from Book I to Book II examines the proclivity and preposterous effects of life as a transparent, colorless woman with a colorful soul and blemished heritage. Hill provides a spectacular, less traveled perspective through Emma in Book II. The descriptions of Rudell, white & black, are relentless, making you blink to ensure clarity. Emma's candor, determination, and wrath stir controversy, and brew conflict. Book III is about innocence and freedom, promoting the peace one receives by accepting themselves; unashamed.<BR> <BR>Painting pictures and embracing history with syllables of spirited lyrics, Hill fosters courage and romance, enveloping soulful love that evaporates from your pores and dances in the wind. You are transported into situations and perils seemingly insurmountable to our 20th century imaginations.

Hill flows effortlessly from one scene to another, summing up necessities swiftly, but deftly providing decadent details through her mellodious cadence. <br />Rhythms was a lesson in rich fiction writing. Spirals of sound, ripples of racing emotions, and staggering sensations of style resonated through out this novel. Hills words are lyrical, spontaneous, and stinging. She takes her time, not rushing the stream of silence you'll experience during the rise and fall of this story. Rhythms reminded me of a slow, sultry jazz tune, a spry dance of jubilance through a stream of sunlight. <br />I guarantee you'll enjoy this novel....	2002-02-01

The novel has situations that keep you turning each page, anticipating the next calamity. The characters are amazing, yet believable, audacious, yet precocious.<br />We follow DeDe through her beguiling courtship with Stephan, her dubious friendship with Dionne, and her strained relationship with her siblings. The writing propels you along with lurid situations and memorable characters. Drama drips from each chapter.<br />Consequently, the novel drops off towards the end. We are built up with an extremely toxic situation, only to be left hanging, bewildered and incomplete. Nevertheless, No More LoveMaking has a unique plot surrounded by familiar subplots. I would recommend reading this novel. It is extremely entertaining.  <br />I would give the novel 3.5 stars, but that's not an option. 3 Stars does not indicate that this is a poorly written novel. My pet peeve is questionable endings, but the rest of the novel is colorful and exciting. EXCELLENT!	2002-01-08

The Matthews brothers, Victor, Nathan, and Clifford stay on my mind, although I've finished the novel. I am still laughing at Victor, worried about Clifford, and a tad disgusted with Nathan. Bittersweet is a delectable novel that exposes the thoughts, pain, and weariness of a naÃ¯ve man that lost control of his marriage and heart, an avarice man that battles thoughts of lust, and an angry man that is just fed up with it all, but extinguishes those negative flames by using his experiences to help another. Bittersweet reminds us that appearances are deceiving, family is paramount, life is not fair, and that everyone, even the deity, is human.<br />This fluid, plot driven novel kept me quickly flipping pages. Something was always occurring and grabbing my interest. I mostly enjoyed the multiple stimulating plots that were extremely exciting and realistic, along with the genuine characters and penchant subject matters.<br />The only thing that bothered me about the novel was that because it was plot driven, the characterization suffered slightly. I had a problem with most of the blue-collar characters speaking slang, and jagged English namely one of the brothers. It was very questionable. I was puzzled because Victor, Nathan, and Clifford, were born to the same parents, grew up in the same house, and their mother was an educator...yet, one of these boys chronically punctured the English language, like substituting &quot;fambly&quot; for family. Then I noticed that all the characters leading less than desirable lives or having blue-collar jobs spoke incorrect grammar and over exhausted slang. Nevertheless, Johnson redeemed himself because this least plausible brother was the most knowledgeable, insightful, and compassionate. <br />Bittersweet is engaging and intense. The intermingling perils will entertain you, and elicit fluctuating emotions. I'm looking forward to a sequel, to check up on the Matthews brothers. These fellows are something else. Don't miss out....you want to check these brothers out.	2002-01-08

Doc's existence is saturated by a foreboding cloud the instant his eyes land on his daughter's battered face. A wing of complexity, confusion, and captivating energy, Doc faces betrayal, an unsettled past, and a psyche battle within. This story of repentance, restitution, and regret occurs in two parts, distinguishing internal and external ghosts that Doc experiences, and successfully testing the extremely thin line between rationale and insanity. <br />Aside from the intoxicating story, I most enjoyed Alexander Parson's writing style. His subtle metaphors and similes are smooth and rich. The lyrical cadence of his words blur the lewd setting of the novel, encouraging us to focus on the bewildered character's thoughts, movements, progressions, and regressions. He institutes words that birth vivid visions from his loaded descriptions. Using unique sentence structure, Parson provides vibrant insight into Doc's errant thoughts as he faces his demons. <br />He marries this insurmountable story with ripe words and emerges with acute, thought provoking descriptions that beckon you to process and understand William 'Doc' Kane. Humor is sprinkled within acerbic situations keeping the readers attentive to the protagonist. <br />I was confused and a tad frustrated with the ending of the novel. It left too much for me to decipher with my limited knowledge of this subject. Nevertheless, Leaving Disneyland is a splendid obscurity of right and wrong, reality and sanity that gives us a brief existence inside the walls of a prison. Parson provides an interesting perspective through Doc Kane's character, but there is no slack in the stealth persuasion to understand the criminal. The story is real, it's intriguing, and enormously thought provoking.	2001-11-17

An impenetrable friendship birthed via the fictional Theta Phi Kappa Sorority is the glue of the story.  Shereen, Yolanda, Jessica, and Ellie are characters that jump off the page. Four very different women bonded in friendship. Jessica is vulnerable and mellifluous, her turmoil toxic. Yolanda is arduous, prideful, and often strong, her impervious demeanor shaken by some surprising secrets.  Ellie is dizzy and desperate, lacking direction and respect. Shereen is emotional and trustworthy with quiet strength. The resonating theme throughout the novel is friendship. The trials these women face are profound; however, their insurmountable friendship propels them to peace and resolution.<br />What I really enjoyed about this book is that there is no anemic narration....the characters are well developed. The pages are alive with these bright characters that are full of life; telling you their stories. Kayla writes with such endowing emotions. Each character tells you who they are, what they need, their fears, their secrets, and their imperfections. Sincerity drips from each sagaciously crafted character. I also enjoyed how Kayla Perrin expertly put into words the pain of a broken heart, the elation of marriage, the trepidation one feels in a new relationship, and the confusions in making decisions. <br />Not only did I feel a consortium of emotions, but I was also sitting on the edge of my seat in anticipation, and beating my brain trying to figure out the mystery.

Never before have I read a novel that explored multiple sides of so many unchartered issues. Adams' candor is simply intoxicating and effulgent.<br />This novel oscillates between Mingus Browning and her family. The author conceptualizes the affect that divorce has on adults, the damages of surpressing desires, and the anguish that secrets and lies can cause. Now, one might say they've read novels with similar storylines. But, Jenoyne Adams wasn't the author. This author has a magnetic way of opening her characters' souls, exposing their fears, intentions, and inner demons. The story is not one sided at all. As readers, we receive all of the participants and affected parties' points of view.<br />Besides the explosive characters and stellar storyline, Resurrecting Mingus is also brisk and eloquent. It's a quick, yet engulfing read. Adams is extremely voluminous providing just the right amount of lucid descriptions and toxic lyrics.<br />This blistering novel will grab your attention and interest and hold it until your eyes reach the last page.

Traditional Star Wars Excitement and Imagination	&quot;Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter&quot; is a sagacious spin off the move Phantom Menace; however the novel takes place before the movie. Reaves delivers a delightful chase tale with the sinister Darth Maul as the hunter. The lyrics are enticing, eliciting macabre images of the surreptitious Sith against not only the Jedi, but other ubiquitous forces. Reaves grabs your imagination, your love for Star Wars, and your thirst for adventure, wraps it up into an engrossing tale, and delivers an audacious story that will have you turning pages into the wee hours of the night.<br />Reaves maintains the traditional Star Wars imaginative galaxy of mystique characters, menacing environments, and stimulating battles between good and evil. He introduces some new characters and expounds on familiar characters, but still manages to give us a capricious adventure. The story is not at all jagged; instead, the plot is tightly wound and intramural. The characters are lurid, colorful, and engrossing.<br />I'm hoping that Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter is the initial book, and that this spin off will evolve into a collection of ominous tales that will keep all of us Star Wars junkies occupied and entertained.	2001-02-21

A Day Late and a Dollar Short is a hilarious, emotional, and breezy read. Terry successfully wrote the entire novel in first person, which is very difficult to do. The characters are intricately developed, colorful, and original...and Terry is the singular voice for them all, which is an outstanding accomplishment. The dialogue is snappy, quick, and exploding with  wit.  Each character is as sassy and witty as the last one. Every chapter presents some type of calamity that will have you doubled over laughing or shaking your head with any number of emotions.<br />The Price family represents so many types of families. Every family has its drama, and believe me, the Price family has enough drama if your family doesn't have any. The three sisters, the kids, and the husbands, plus the one brother, the dad, and the matriarch, Viola all have issues that will have you laughing, contemplating, fussing, and crying. The multitude of issues that Terry addresses in this novel might make you understand your siblings more, appreciate your parents more, or realize something about yourself. I haven't read another novel yet, that touches on so many potent perils and ascribes so many different angles and solutions, using such a brazen voice.<br />There were three things that really impressed me in this novel: Terry's masterful, flawless use of first person for every single unique character; the piercing dialogue and explosive interaction of the characters; and third was this enlightening story of a family that kept me relentlessly turning pages. I could go on for days and days with accolades for A Day Late and a Dollar Short, but I don't want to keep rambling. So, go buy this book (don't borrow it, buy your own), and enjoy it...I guarantee you'll love it.	2001-01-16

Lolita has a gift for creating spicy and unique characters that arouse our curiosity, tickle our funny bone, and lure us into their lives and battles.<br />Blind Ambitions has something that interests everyone. This clever novel shows that Lolita is a versatile author, whose writing spans multiple arenas.

The story is unique and fascinating. The words are lyrical, enticing your imagination. The descriptions are graceful, and the love scenes are tasteful and compassionate. The author uses adjectives that awaken and tantalize your senses.<br />However, the point of view and voice are often sporadic and ambiguous. Often I didn't know whether I was in the past or present, and what character was thinking or speaking. I'm not sure if the novel was meant to have a level of mystique, but what it ended up being was incomplete. Initially, the aura of mystery was compelling until I reached the end of the novel. The pages ended, the novel was finished, but the mystery still remained. One of the main characters, Bruce, has a secret that's been eating him up inside. I never got what the secret was...what the problem was. I went back through the novel to investigate, and concluded that the secret could have been any number of things because the author dropped hints on numerous problems.<br />If not for the ambiguity and the unfinished ending, this novel would have received four stars because it's a quick, compelling, and absorbing novel that tugs at your mind with each page.	2000-10-13

Omar's account of the eighties was so thorough and in depth...the loose language, the flashy clothes, the `I'm better than you' attitude, was vivid and consistent. Tracy Ellison, the main character  of Flyy Girl, is a year younger than me. So reading Flyy Girl took me back  to my own youth, when I wore Coca Cola sweatshirts, Guess jeans, and so  much gold that it would blind you. Subliminally, I went back to the `80s  dances and parties. It was so refreshing to read.<br />What struck me most was  the accuracy of the growing pains that the young female characters in Flyy  Girl encountered. The profound peer pressure, the dubious dating game, and  the ferocious family matters, were so in depth. Since Omar is a male  writing about the internal feelings and thinking of growing girls, I was  very impressed with the authenticity of Tracy and Raheema's feelings,  confidence level, maturation level, and perspectives on issues. I also  enjoyed Raheema's subplot....Tracy's lavish, spoiled, perfect life is one  realm of female adolescence, then Raheema's overbearing, protected, and  acrid environment is another aspect, yet the intermingling of such  different upbringings made the story extremely real and alive to me. Plus  the flagrant differences in their personalities enriched the dilemas in the  novel. Lastly, I was impressed with the degree of growth that all the  characters in the novel underwent. Tracy and her parents matured...Raheema  and her family matured as well. <br />I'm just glad that I didn't have to wait  for the sequel. It's out now, I've got it, and I'm reading it next. If you  want a refreshing and real story, read Flyy Girl. This book is even good  for some teenagers. Good job Omar.	2000-08-01

Zane dispels a colorful story about a love that transcends obstacles and an addiction that is the  catapult for the turmoil in the characters' lives.

With unbridled anticipation, I soared through  this book, my eyes raced over each page digesting every tantalizing word  and piercing dilema. Every time I sighed with relief thinking the danger  was over, another adversary appeared in the next chapter threatening to  break the last link holding Zoe's life together.	2000-06-26

This time, Tamara's destination was Atlantic City. I've read all of the Tamara Halye mysteries since their inception almost  ten years ago. I must say, that in the next mystery, I'd like to see Tamara  get ahead. I'd like to see her business expand, maybe she could get a  partner, maybe she could get a love life....I am just saddened that Tamara  is no better off now then she was in 1994. Nevertheless, I'll keep rooting  for her, and waiting for the next mystery.	2000-06-26

Every situation captured my attention, held my concern, and  heard my opinion. HomeCourt Advantage is a ficticious account of a  pro-basketball team called the Flyers. All kind of seedy mayhem occurs: a  player dealing with a fatally attracted X, a friend in love with a player  who can't return her adoration, and a rookie in love with a 'non-black'  women. Not to mention the threat of the Flyers team being sold. But in the  middle of all this is Casey Rogers who some how is the shoulder everyone  cries on and the rock everyone depends on. But while Casey's helping  everybody with their problems, let's hope she remembers to solve her own.  HomeCourt Advantage is an appealing page turner full of the ingredients  that make a good novel.	2000-06-14

US	52498644	R13TNTQ7EXWTWP	0380811308	150038577	Skin Deep	Books	3	1	4	N	N	Insightful	Skin Deep gives an oppulent view of dealing with the prejudices and perils that often accompany being of mixed heritage. Kathleen also delves into how one knows who they are. Do you define your race and character according to  your color, creed, and parents, or do you define yourself by who you've  loved and those that love you back? The story made me think about such  things. Insight is all that I received though. I never developed a  relationship with the characters of Skin Deep. I really didn't care what  happened to them or how their problems were solved. This bothered me  because I thought the idea for the story was awesome, but I needed more of  a connection or deep caring for the characters. It took me a while to  finish the story. I didn't race home from work to read it. Nevertheless,  Skin Deep's theme was unique and the point of view held me through out the  novel.	2000-06-12

With each page I turned, my heart thumped loudly, and beads of sweat perched above my upper lip. The novel is a thriller that seduces you and lulls you into the fantasy that  Ms. Due concocts. Dewit and Jessica are soulmates, lovers from different  realms of the heart and different aspects of the mind. Dewit is an immortal  in love with a mortal and Jessica is the recipient of Dewit's lurid love.  Yet this love that connects Dewit &amp; Jessica leads them on a journey of  danger which threatens to rupture their hearts, sever their souls, and send  them spiraling to hell. The intermingling of love and mystery in My Soul to  Keep is spellbinding. While reading this novel, you'll find yourself  cheering, giving advice to the characters, and being seduced into their  tepid world.	2000-06-12

The entire novel was a series of rambling insipid occurrences that were unintersting and shallow. I did enjoy the  humorous dialect and dialogue, but that's not enough. The only episode with  depth was when Tony journeyed home to deal with his younger brother. There  was just no point to the story...no pinnacle, no denoument, and no purpose.  After hours of plowing through this reckless rendition of a story, I  finally just put the novel in a pile that I reserve for charity.	2000-06-05

The Bennett's are a successful black family; however, they are not the Cosby's...and that makes the family real. Kieja  always provided just enough mystery to propell you from page to page with  exhilirating anxiety. The subject matter impressed me the most. Kieja wove  a unique story about the perils of harboring hatred, the fluctuating  relationship between mothers and daughters, momentous matrimony, and the  strength of a united family. She successfully melds lessons, characters,  and situations together, and the outcome is a progressive novel that  maintains your interest, and evokes a plethora of emotions from page to  page.	2000-05-09

I kept stumbling over editing errors that made some of the sentences ambiguous. The story  changed abruptly causing me to wonder if I were reading a collection of  stories instead of a novel. The time factor was also confusing. There were  some blatant inconsistencies. I couldn't keep track of how many months or  days elapsed between episodes. For example, I thought Darika was a  housewife, then suddenly she was a school principle with a secretary that  she'd had for four years. At times the story was whimsical and sporadic,  things just randomly popped up, causing me to back track through the pages  to ensure that I hadn't missed something. The characters were inconsistent  in their thinking and revelations. For example, in one chapter Keith loved  Darika, in another he never loved her, in yet another he loved Darika, but  not in a particular way. For Sonia's next novel, it would be wise to get a  good editor that can track everything: grammer, time, consistency, and  details.	2000-04-29

Robyn Williams expertly interweaves intrigue and  romance using her sassy women, strong men, and sultry descriptions, to  produce the next Bestseller....A Twist of Fate.

I plowed through the novel with trepidation, hoping that by the next page something, someone, or some word would spark my interest, but I got to the end of the book, and nothing interesting ever occurred. I was  very disappointed with the lack of intensity, and story telling that  prevailed in this novel. Ms. Berry's first novel, So Good, was an  impressive, interesting, and flowing novel.

Sharon has created a  character with attributes and obstacles that everyone can relate to;  situations that everyone, at one time in their lives, can relate to. I  found Jazz's vulnurability and strength both familiar and inspiring. The  culmination of events that transpired in Jazz's life could have potentially  broke Jazz down, but Hill does a good job of showing that faith in yourself  and God surpasses any tribulation that one might encounter on this earth.  Actions Speak Louder is a refreshing, inspiring, realistic look at a young  women maturing and finding herself. You will enjoy it.	2000-04-14

As one who was raised by my father, I could identify with the unsurmountable love that Terry had for his daughters, and the selfishness that the sagacious Catherine displayed. This story is a vociferous wake up call to all who  label all men as dead beat fathers. Parry Brown showed that auspiciousness  isn't enough to raise children. Surprisingly, Catherine's misopeida is not  uncommon among &quot;the 90's&quot; women. Brown's personfification of this  often overlooked characteristic was profound. &quot;The Shirt Off His  Back&quot; is a magnificent story of fatherly love, treasured devotion, and  unsurmountable commitment. It's refreshing and a pleasure to read. I can  speak from experience in expressing that this story is not far fetched or  fairy taled.	2000-04-06

Initially I was bored, but the spiritual innuendos kept me reading. The last five chapters were the most interesting and exciting. So, if you can get past the initial slow story, you'll be pleased. I applaud Patricia for encouraging spiritual principles  in this novel.

I think everyone can learn something about love  and relationships from this novel. Though Marrissa and Myles take part in a  tumultuous journey, it's not far fetched, nor is it a fairy tale. I  appreciated the pensive, realistic, and indepth manner in which the story  unfolds. Each page left me racing to the next, and surprisingly, I couldn't  predict the outcome. If you want to read a REAL love story with familiar  and beliveable ups and downs, read Good Peoples.	2000-03-26

The story line propelled me from page to  page with such vigor, that when I got to the last page I was startled. I  love that Jacquese has twists and turns in this story that mirrors suspense  movies. You won't be disappointed. I do however, wish that there were more  aesthetic descriptions of the characters. The existing ones were so sketchy  that I couldn't successfully imagine what some of the characters looked  like. I knew who they were, how they thought, and what they liked, but the  characters lacked real description. Nevertheless, that didn't take away  from the perilous tale.	2000-03-17

She uses lyrical, pivoting words that enhance the imagination, and stir the story around in your mind. 'Blues Dancing' is the  best writing and use of words that I've read in a long time. This novel is  the balance between the overly descriptive novels, and the 'tell a tale'  novels. This is the first novel that I've read by Diane, and I was  thoroughly impressed. Her characters were so well developed and described,  that I could actually feel them, their dilemas, their pain, and their  longing.

Environmental descriptions are important, and 'The Maintenance Man' failed  to electrify me because the characters simply plane hopped to Atlanta, Los  Angeles, and Chicago. There were no indepth descriptions; ie. street names,  atmospheric descriptions, or people descriptions. I really couldn't invoke  fundamental character traits because the characters lacked depth, and were  too defined by their actions. Also, the story line is a rendention of  'Cheaters' without the lovely details and descriptions. Baisden tells an  interesting story, but the novel needs more enriched &amp; developed  characters, poignant descriptions, and twists to the tale. I did, however,  enjoy 'Men Cry In The Dark'. :-)	2000-03-02

He is never able to marry his horrific plot and the traditional Star Wars plot. If you remove any pretenses of Star Wars, you have a horror story with characters  slaying people with axes. I was very disappointed. The notable  characteristics of Han Solo, and Leia were altered, and the plots involving  Solo &amp; Leia were too comical. The omnipotence of 'The Force' was absent  from this book. I think more previous research from the Bantam books should  have occurred. I hope that the future Del Rey books remain with the  traditional plots, characters, feel, and atmosphere of Star Wars Sagas.	2000-01-06
