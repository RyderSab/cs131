Books	2	24	39	N	Y	Stupid White "Man"	I'm afraid this book reduces to only one stupid white man: Michael Moore.  I really wanted to like this book, and I have loved his earlier work. This book, however, devolves into juvenile  and unsupported rantings about things as wide ranging as day care and affirmitive action.  Michael Moore proposes superficial and laughable fixes to our society . His proposals read like the naive opinions of an adolescent, not an educated adult.  I understand that Moore has found this provocative style useful in the past.  In \\"Stupid White Men,\\" this style only casts doubt on the legitimacy of many of his arguments.  I was especially disappointed  because I found his dissection of the Florida episode of  the 2000 election intriguing.  Unfortunately, the rest of the book made me wonder how much I should really believe anything he says.  He reminded me of today's far right broadcasters who mold the facts to fit their agendas.  Perhaps, Michael Moore should  broaden his horizons by taking a few of those college courses that he finds so worthless.	2002-05-20

After reading &quot;The Millionaire Next Door,&quot; I was eager to read this book. &quot;The Millionaire Mind&quot; is based more on Stanley's subjective ideas about who the average millionaire is than on any actual data. I became very tired of reading story after story about how people who screw up in high school and college become successful millionaires and how millionaire wives make the best homemakers in the world. If his data supported these views, it would be fascinating; however, his data actually shows that most millionaires did complete a college education. Who knows if the wife thing is true or just the way Stanley would like things to be. In the book, Stanley discusses how integrity is a quality of most millionaires. Then, he proceeds to tell stories about successful millionaires who admit to lying about their credentials or who play slight of hand with their customers. In one story, Stanley tells how a salesman changes the size on some jeans (to a smaller size) and gives them to the wife of a potential client. How disgusting and underhanded is that? Not to mention, it's pandering of the worst kind. If you're interested in the topic of millionaires, read the first book. Don't waste your money on &quot;The Millionaire Mind.&quot;	2001-09-19

I certainly tired of reading The Bear and the Dragon.  A friend recommended that I read this novel because of the recent diplomatic problems with China and the American spy plane.  The book pales in comparison to the real drama.  <br />Jack Ryan has been a great character in the previous novels.  In this one, his age shows badly.  He's a character that has lost his shine.  In the story, Ryan has reluctantly run for and been elected to the presidency.  He doesn't really like his job.  By the end, I wish he had just resigned.  Clancy uses abortion in a very inflamatory way to paint the Chinese as horrible people.  Clancy should have saved his opinions on this issue for a letter to the editor.  Instead, he should have written a compelling story.  Skip this one.  If you're new to Clancy, read his earlier novels, like Red October.  They're much, much better stories.	2001-05-05

His Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is extraordinary.  This lastest novel falls short of his best.  Justin, a career British diplomat, has been content to grow yellow freesias for his beloved younger wife.  Suddenly Justin's well ordered life becomes turbulent when Tessa, his wife, turns up brutally murdered.  Then, the understated and boring Justin springs into to action to discover the true details of his wife's and her friend's murders.  Justin slips away from the British Diplomatic Service and becomes a pretty good spy.  As he uncovers the conspiracy of the world's largest pharmaceutical corporations, his life becomes endangered.<br />The story's premise and its characters didn't ring true.  Tessa seemed a naive and well meaning do-gooder, not the hard-nosed lawyer she supposedly was.  Justin was never quite able to fill the shoes of a strong leading character.  His motive for becoming a spy, to avenge his wife's death, seems at times pathetic rather than heroic.  The drug trial conspiracy would have been totally suspect as contrived if not for the recent scandals surrounding the cancer research facility in Seattle.  This organization has been accused of some of the same abuses as the companies in the novel.  Anyone who has followed the Seattle scandals will find the parallels in the book uncanny.<br />Despite its flaws, The Constant Gardener, would be an OK summer afternoon's read.  Wait for the paperback.	2001-04-21

In it, McCourt proves once again that he is a great storyteller.  In the hands of a less adept writer, the subject matter of these books would be nothing more than dismal.  With Frank McCourt's pen, they become engaging and even delightful stories.<br />In this book, the reader will suffer the successes and failures of McCourt as he moves to New York, goes to college, and becomes an English teacher.  I can only hope that my children will some day have as talented a person for their teacher. I had only one nagging question after reading 'Tis, Did Frank ever find a cure for his red eyes?	2001-01-26

After reading Remains of the Day, I couldn't wait to read this lastest novel by Kazuo Ishiguro.  When We Were Orphans doesn't begin to approach the quality of Remains of the Day.  While it tries to be a detective novel, When We Were Orphans fails even at that.  Instead, it details the pathetic life of a boy (he stays a boy even as a man) whose parents made a mess of their lives.  At the age of nine, Christopher Banks finds himself uprooted from Shanghai, the only home he has known.  Because he loses both parents through mysterious circumstances, he is packed off to England to live with his aunt.  As an adult, Banks becomes a detective and weaves a fantasy about the circumstances of his parents' disappearance.  This fantasy follows much the same type of storyline that he pursued in play when he was a boy in China.  At the end of this book, this fantasy becomes entirely unbelievable to the reader.  Finally, even Ishiguro tires of it and wraps up the story in a few pages.  He jars Banks into reality with the true story of his parents' demise.  The reader will be glad, too, to be jarred awake as this plodding and dull novel finally comes to an end.	2001-01-17

The young lives of Frank McCourt and his brothers and sister were so bleak.  McCourt's wonderful writing style pulled me through.  At every turn, the odds seemed to be against the remaining McCourt children (2 brothers and a sister died) ever seeing adulthood.  Despite the grinding poverty and despair of his family, McCourt somehow maintained his sense of humor in many parts of the book.	2001-01-03

In a departure from his previous books, Parker uses a female P.I. named Sunny Randall.  It's a case of stick with what you know, and Parker clearly doesn't know how to be a woman.  You can never quite shake the idea that Sunny sees the world through a man's (Parker's?) perspective. You never get that feeling with the Spenser novels.  Spenser always came across in a believable way.  Sunny does not.<br />In this story, Sunny has a collection of bumbling relatives and friends.  Parker interweaves their stories with a murder case that Sunny decides to pursue even though she isn't getting paid.  All in all, nothing too unexpected happens. The bumbling relatives and friends never really resolve their little problems, and their stories contribute little or nothing to the main plot.  The only good thing about this novel is that it's quick and easy to read.	2000-10-09

Hemingway used his experiences as a journalist during the Spanish Civil War to build the structure for this novel.  His descriptions of the settings are superb. The novel is a great introduction to the Spanish Civil  War, a war with which many Americans are unfamiliar. Hemingway used  characters like Pablo to show how people lose their humanity during war.   The story is powerful.  His main character, Robert Jordan, begins to  question whether anything good will come of all the fighting.<br />Despite its  many wonderful attributes, this novel has some problems.  The dialogue is  stilted.  The romance (as in all Hemingway novels) is unbelievable.   Finally, Hemingway should have stuck to English.  His use of Spanish in  this book is embarassing.<br />Nonetheless, in my opinion, For Whom the Bell  Tolls should be required reading for all U.S. high school students.  It's  truly a classic.	2000-05-31

The good news is that about halfway through, The Map of the World becomes a page turner.  You want to find out what is going to happen.  It's kind of like gossiping about the neighbors or reading the tabloids.  You know that  something is wrong, but you're not really sure about all the details.  <br />The bad news about this novel is that all the characters are just so  ordinary. Even the extraordinary circumstances in which they find  themselves (a toddler drowning and child sex abuse charges) don't serve to  bring out anything exceptional in these characters.  At the end of this  book, I felt that Jane Hamilton had played with her readers by basing her  story on such sensational and emotion-filled events.  Usually an author  uses events like these to bring out the best or worst in her characters.   In this case, nothing changes.  The Goodhearts (can you believe this  name?), are just as ordinary at the end of the book as they were at the  beginning. While Hamilton tries to make them seem extraordinary because  they are latter day hippies in the middle of suburbia, she does not  succeed. The horrible events, not the characters or plot, carry this story.   The ending of the book is predictable and not terribly interesting.	2000-05-19

Byatt does a superb job of digging into the well hidden secrets of a Victorian family in Morpho Eugenia.  The subtle comparison to insect societies is superbly done.  I  just wish that this novel had not been paired with The Conjugal Angel.   This second novel just doesn't live up to the quality of Morpho Eugenia.   It's just a bore.  Buy Angels and Insects for the first novel.  Skip the  second one.  Morpho Eugenia remains one of my favorite quirky novels.  I  just wish that the movie was available on DVD.	2000-05-13

In fact, that's part of the problem. It almost reads like notes from someone's vacation. Craven spends so much time describing the beautiful Pacific Northwest that she  forgets to make her characters live the story.  As a result, the characters  remain one dimensional.  <br />While this book purports to be about Native  Americans, don't be deceived.  It is more about the priest who is assigned  to live with them.  Everything we learn about the Native Americans is shown  to us through the the priest's eyes.  <br />The book's ending stretches the  reader's patience.  Throughout the book, the priest lives a vigorous,  physical life.  He does this in spite of a diagnosis made at the beginning  of the book that he has a terminal disease and will die within three years.   Of course, this diagnosis is kept secret from the priest.  He'll be the  last to know. Only at the end of the story does the priest's mysterious  disease take its toll. His health suddenly declines, and the people of the  village ask him to stay and live his final days with them.  The reader is  left to wonder how this priest could not have known that his health was in  jeapordy.  Probably, it was because he felt fine throughout most of his  stay in Kingcome (the village's name).	2000-05-12

This book was an interesing read.  I agree with the authors that the medical community is doing a disservice to women by trying to &quot;cure&quot; menopause.  Nonetheless, I am very skeptical of this  book's remedies.  Some of these herbs may have real value.  Before women  start using these &quot;remedies,&quot; I think they should wait until  valid scientific studies show the usefulness and safety of herb remedies.	1999-10-04

Binchy spent many pages developing her character Ria.  In the end, however, I grew to appreciate Ria.  One does ponder though how Ria could have been so blind for so many  years to the her husband and best friend's endless lying.  Binchy spends  hardly any time developing the American character with whom Ria trades  homes.  The ending is a little trite.	1999-09-09

The characters were fairly well developed, but completely boring.  This book is about a group of four women whose friendship supports them through the pitfalls of life.   Only one of the women (the cancer patient) has any backbone.  The others  seem to be incapable of confronting and solving their problems.  Reviewers  have called this book emotion packed. I failed to find much emotion here.   Instead it was filled with whiny, boring women.  It drips with everything  you see in a daytime soap. I finished this book only because I bought it in  hardcover. I kept hoping it would get better.  It didn't.  I'll give this  one away to the library.

Throughout the story, all the  characters remained unlikeable.  While I understand that they were caught  in a cultural web not of their making, none of the characters was able to  break free.  The literary devices employed by Roy served as a distraction  rather than an enhancement of this story. Also,  Roy's disjointed writing  style was extremely annoying.	1998-11-02

This book does a great service for parents and families of hard-to-parent children.  It descibes one of my children to a tee.  I particularly liked this book for its emphasis on finding ways to help these children become  successful, happy children and eventually adults.  Parents of these  children can become discouraged (I know I have many times).  This book  keeps them on the road to a successful relationship with their child.    When I asked one psychologist why my child acts the way she does, he  responded that not every child is easy to raise and that I had gotten one  of the more challenging ones.  He encouraged me to be creative with the  ways in which I handled this child because the usual methods were unlikely  to work.  This book, The Explosive Child,  reinforced this helpful man's  advice.	1998-11-02

It really is about how people achieive financial freedom.  I grew tired as I read this book.  The authors kept hammering away at the same themes over and over again.  They could have written a much shorter book and still conveyed the same information.  I also grew tired of their &quot;preachiness.&quot;   They clearly believe that saving every dollar is good and that leading a comsumption oriented lifestyle is bad.   While I happen to be in the &quot;save every dollar&quot; camp myself, I don't think that the other lifestyle is inherently bad.  If someone derives pleasure from working  all his/her  life so that he/she can acquire huge piles of status objects (or take great/lavish vacations), I really don't mind.  I only object when these people mess up and can't pay for their extravagances.  On the other hand, I thought that some of the &quot;millionaires&quot; were a little obsessive.  Imagine being a millionaire and spending your time clipping coupons every night.  While you might save a dollar or two, wouldn't your time be better spent evaluating where you can best grow your nest egg?	1998-06-26

This book just doesn't have the same feel as some of his earlier books.  In this one, I had a hard time liking Spenser.  He has a drinking problem. He's no longer just a gormet.  He's a glutton.  Finally, Spenser feels a little better, but only after a short visit with his girlfriend.  Give me a break!  By the way, Susan (his girlfriend) was a pretty shallow character in this novel.<br />The weak plot isn't anything  we really care about, even though it's supposed to involve some pretty steamy stuff.  Instead, it's  about some pathetic, unlikeable  people who do stupid things---not very exciting.  Luckily, it's a quick read.	1998-05-29

I didn't think the writing stood up to the glowing reviews that I read.  On the other hand, it's a quick read.  The plots of the stories were very predictable.  After you read one, you had really read all of them. I used to live in West,  and I've known a few cowboys in my time.  Her portrayal  of both was a little trite.  These guys weren't cowboys, they were just garden variety  losers.	1998-05-26

The author paints a bleak picture of life for adolescent girls.  She gives very little (if any) credit to the girls who succeed quite nicely through the tribulations of adolescence.  Nor has the author done a statistically valid sampling of teenage girls.  Instead, because she works with troubled teens, she assumes that ALL teens suffer these problems.  Guess what?  If you talk to troubled girls, you're going to find troubles.  Wow!  What a concept.   The case studies in this book are disturbing and touching.  You really feel for these girls.  They have definitely lost themselves somewhere.  Yet, until I see a study of randomly selected girls, I will remain unconvinced that this book accurately reflects the lives of anyone other than these specific individuals.	1998-05-26

While some first novels are destined for greatness, this isn't one of them.  It's mind candy that leaves a sour aftertaste.  The plot is predictable and plodding.  The characters would be right at home on the daytime soaps.  And the ending?  It's laughable at best.  For Redford's sake, I hope the movie isn't as boring.  From the trailers I've seen, though, I think I'll skip it.  The book was bad enough.	1998-05-07

For me, a hero is someone who, when faced with the worst possible situation, can turn, look it in the eye, and go on to beat the odds.   This inspirational book introduces us to the man behind the handsome movie star face. Even before the terrible accident, Reeve's approach toward life paints the picture of a competitive man with a zest for life.  In the face of adversity and self-doubt, he proves that he is a person who has what is takes to meet his challenges head on.  He doesn't sugar coat his situation.  Instead,  he presents his story in a reflective and balanced way.  I gained admiration for him, his wife, Dana, and his children.  I wish him and his family well in their  quest for a cure.  I'm sure though that whatever the future holds for this man, he and and his family willl give it everything they have. This book is a must read.  It touched my heart.	1998-05-04

I had a hard time finishing this book.  It has one good point:  suburbs, by design, destroy the cohesion of communities.  The author repeats this point (in my opinion) ad naseum throughout the book.  He also idealizes community meeting places (the tavern, the drug store, main street) from the past.  Nonetheless, I still think that  we should all read this book.  It gives at least a few hints about why we never see some of the people who live only two doors down form us. His solutions also might help us break down the isolation and anonymity of the 'burbs.	1998-04-30

I read this book while on vacation in a fairly remote location (of course, nothing like Everest). The book made me take a good look at the selling of adventure travel.  Should people really be able to sign a check and buy adventure trips?  Or, should they have to earn the right to participate?  I came away  hoping that people will try harder to earn their way onto trips like Everest; however, I'm  not in favor of someone (governments, for example) telling people whether or not they can take such a trip. People who  buy adventure travel should realize that they might have to accept the ultimate risk. I'm not sure that most paying adventurers  really believe that they are taking much risk.  It's just a vacation, right?  Afterall, they paid to have someone make it &quot;safe.&quot;  I think that people who want to buy trips like this need to examine their motives. Statistical adventure travel can be hazardous.  People who sell adventure travel need to make their clients really understand that adventure travel carries certain risks.  It cannot be made as safe as a trip to the amusement park.	1998-03-21

This isn't a &quot;pure&quot; mathematics book. It is often superficial.   It does tackle many social and political issues.  All that said, I still enjoyed reading it.  The author provokes people to think about the topics and  question whether a mathematical approach would  clarify these ideas and points of view.  Every day,  the popular press bombards us with new &quot;scientific&quot; studies that supposedly tell us about causes for the ills of our society.    Often, these studies use questionable mathematics to support their conclusions.  As readers, I think we can all fall prey to believing the studies that support our views of the world and disbelieving those that run counter to our beliefs.   In the Universe and the Teacup, the author tries to get readers to scrutinize and objectify this information a little bit more.  Unfortunately, I think the book suffers  a little bit from the malady it's trying to address.	1998-03-19
