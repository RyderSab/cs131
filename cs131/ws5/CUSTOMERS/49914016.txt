I consider this much better, here's why.  For me, I prefer thrillers to be thrilling.  I prefer a little mystery with the horror that goes along with it.  I really liked that he didn't make any part of this a romance and the characters were likeable (except for the killer of course!)<br /><br />One thing that really struck me about this story is something that I cannot mention in the review so as not to give away a twist or the end, but there is a part of the tale that will shock you.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, and look forward to more by Mr. Margolin!	2005-03-07

The suspense was awesome and kept me guessing until the very end.<br /><br />I tried so hard to stay awake last night to finish it as the climax was awesome, but alas the work week caught up to me and I couldn't do it.  However, along with my cup of coffee this morning I grabbed this book and finishing it was the first thing I did today.<br /><br />Excellent read, highly recommended.	2005-02-26

Most of the fun was in trying to figure out what was real from Anderson's life, and what was fiction!<br /><br />I would have to say that I'll read the sequel.  Sometimes it's fun to pick up a book that doesn't make you think to hard, this was one that can be taken to the beach and enjoyed while drinking your rum punch.	2004-10-22

Moore's ability to make you feel like one of the characters (or a charater depending on how you look at it) is uncanny.<br />Kona is by far my favorite character in this book, brah.  If only we could all say the things he does and have it sound as funny.<br />As always, Moore hits the mark in his newest venture.	2003-06-06

I've recently experienced a death in my family, my mother actually, and this book has helped me grieve with humor.  It helps in a small way to believe, fiction or not, that even angels have humor, and that perhaps my mother is really enjoying laughter in heaven.    Have fun with this one, don't take it too seriously and you will find yourself enjoying yourself immensly.	2003-05-18
