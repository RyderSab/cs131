His all too brief account of his childhood in the spotlight of the PTL television ministry and what happened after his father's fall can be riveting at times.  Bakker's childhood was one of privilege that was wrested away mainly by the machinations of rival television preachers.  He reveals the motivations of Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell and others mainly being attempts to gain money and influence at the cost of his family's happiness and harmony.   <br /> <br />More important is what happened afterward.  Bakker becomes something of a drifter.  He enters the world of clubbing, partying, drinking and drugs.  And it takes him a long time to realize how addicted he's become and how much these things are affecting his life.  Good things happen along the way.  He makes friends, meets and marries his wife, founds a ministry, but most importantly, he discovers what has made him depressed.  He was trying to earn his salvation rather than discover grace, hence the title of the book.  <br /> <br />You get the sense that Bakker isn't all the way there yet.  He still has steps to take and things to do.  The book is several years old now and hopefully there will be a follow up volume to fill in some the gaps.  I think he has discovered the true heart of Christianity and reaches out to those who need it most.  All the while dealing with the learning disorder, dyslexia. <br /> <br />The book is written in a clear and simple, but not simplistic, style that make it very easy to read and difficult to put down.  I read it in a few hours and am very glad I did.	2005-06-06

Where \\"Running with Scissors\\" recalls instances from a dysfunctional childhood, here the author tells a series of consecutive tales; all are closely related.   <br /> <br />Mr. Burroughs holds nothing back as he tells the tale of his sobering-up and plumbs the depths of his soul at the same time.  This is a revealing book and an emotional rollercoaster.  The author's true gift is being able to determine where to put the humor.  He is able to see the humorous touches during his time in rehabilitation while holding back when recounting the decline and death of his best friend and first lover.  In fact, he expounds in an almost reverent tone despite the fact the he was emotionally numb at the time. <br /> <br />While reading this, I had a tough time putting the book down.  It is amazingly well written, painfully honest, and tells us not only the events, but the thoughts and feelings behind those events.  This is a harrowing tale of the dangers of addiction made all the more frightening because it is true.   <br />	2004-11-26

This is a truly amazing accomplishment for someone who rarely attended school.  He certainly has talent.  His descriptions go into great detail without being boring allowing a reader to easily conjure images of the action and settings.  He transitions well from one point in his life to the next and he is more than able to evoke a smile or a laugh from his unique perspective of the various situations. <br /> <br />But is this a funny book? <br /> <br />In my opinion, no.  Overall this book is dark and depressing.  The childhood is one that should have never been.  Mr. Burroughs should have become a ward of the state had the state known what was going on.  No one who attempted to raise him was a fit parent.  The author seemed to have come to terms with his bizarre upbringing at an early age, but any happiness he may have expressed seemed superficial at best. <br /> <br />Things improve toward the end of the book.  The author is in his mid twenties and has garnered some degree of success (and an addiction to alcohol it seems.  The description of a martini described as a bowl of vodka soup is priceless.)  It ends here and you need to purchase the follow up, \\"Dry\\", to find out the rest.  As of this writing I have not done this, but I probably will.  \\"Running with Scissors\\" is not light reading.  To be honest, when I first finished it I wasn't sure what to make of it.  The best description I can arrive at is: \\"Interesting novelty\\".	2004-09-24

Taking the most well know book in the world, the Christian Bible, and retelling it from the losing party's point of view, we get some of the worlds most well known tales with a fascinating twist.   <br /> <br />Starting out in another universe on the brink of destruction, the inhabitants of that dimension flee to our universe to survive.  Finding nothing here, they create the world for a singular purposse.  They need the power of faith to sustain them.  This order of powerful beings splits when one (Lucifer) rebels against manipulating the forthcoming humans into becoming repositories of faith.  They are hurled to the center of the earth for their efforts.  (This event becomes the meteor that destroyed the dinosaurs.)  Thus begins the twists on the traditional Bible stories all told from Satan's point of view.  Satan/Lucifer may not be such a bad guy after all.  The book goes beyond the end of the Bible and winds up with Satan meeting with an ancestor of Martin Luther, eventually provoking the reformation. <br /> <br />The author has chosen a neo-Shakespearean King James style of English to narrate his \\"recovered manuscript\\" that can be a bit difficult to get through initially.  The concepts and story are strong enough to overcome this and you will find it adds to the overall experience.  The book is short enough to read quickly and get the full impact of this remarkable premise.  Go for it!	2004-09-24

Ehrman has created and excellent document to review a number of texts that were unavailable for hundreds of years because they were unpopular or suppressed.  Mr. Ehrman examines the content of these texts and the theology of the groups who produced them.<br />Mr. Ehrman shows the fractured beginnings of Christianity and the four main groups who spread their ideas.  Much like today, writers in ancient times would critique each other through publications.  In many cases the original work that is being critiqued is no longer extant.  The able Mr. Ehrman can draw the meaning of original from the oppositional prose.  <br />In addition to the theological meanings of the texts, he examines, to some degree, the physicality of them.  He explains that errors and outright deliberate revisions have occurred each time a document was copied.  He explains that most of the works in the canonical New Testament were not written by those they have long been attributed.  One has to wonder how much of the original intent is left in what survives today.<br />This is a fascinating read for those interested in the historical aspects of Christianity.	2004-06-08

When reading this work, it is essential to remember this is a murder mystery at heart, not a volume on theology.<br />The fractured early history of Christianity, the Priory of Sion, Mary and the holy grail and numerous other concepts in this book are not original to the author, but have been freely available for numerous years.  The author merely uses them to encapsulate his mystery and make it far more interesting.  It is certainly not a book that should be criticized like a non fiction book.  Authors are bound to take artistic license here and there to enhance the drama and action in the story.<br />That being said, the book is efficiently written and the action moves at an adequate pace to keep a reader interested through the 450+ pages.  Dan Brown breaks the book into numerous short chapters allowing the reader to have a sense of accomplishment while reading it.  Told in a linear fashion with numerous changes of scene, the reader can easily keep up with the plot and many characters.  Character development could have been better as we don't really get to know what makes any of them tick.  Exposition through narrative is minimal; used only when necessary.  Most exposition is handled by the characters' interaction with each other.  This is a very effective way to reveal the facts to the reader.<br />If you like a mystery and have a theological bent, you will probably enjoy this book.  The proper midset is essential.  If you read this book to criticize it, you will quickly sour on it.  It's not very deep so lay back and have some fun.	2004-04-19

It tells the story of the pontiff who reigned for a mere 34 days before death took him under mysterious circumstances.<br />The book is divided into two parts, the first the story of his life, and the second is the investigation into his death.  I found the biographical part far more interesting.  Albino Luciani was far more than just a poor man devoted to his church who managed to work his way to the top.  The man who would be John Paul I was a man on a mission.  His self appointed goal was to get to the top and reform the Catholic Church.<br />Luciani held the rather unique belief that Moses was a bigot and felt that current Christianity relied too heavily on Moses' teachings while ignoring those of Jesus Christ.  He was involved in an expedition to Egypt to prove that the Israelites were never there and reveal the Old Testament for what it truly is, a fairy tale.  Then Moses' laws commanding the subversion of women, the handicapped, homosexuals, and pretty much anyone who was different could be done away with.<br />John Paul I would never get the chance.  He was found dead on the 34th day of his papacy.  This is where the second part of the book picks up.<br />Already there were contradictions on how, when and by whom the body was found.  Gregoire tries to do an investigation into the death but doesn't get to any satisfying level.  There is simply not enough information available to make a reasonable determination as to who committed the deed or even how it was done.  He does give a thorough list of who could have committed the murder (including the current pontiff) and what motives he might have had, but lacks the evidence to even point a finger at anyone in particular.  The second half of the book is more interesting for its look at the internal Vatican processes, specifically the election of a pope.  <br />Gregoire manages to tell his tale in a fairly linear fashion, but the book sorely needed an editor.  There are too many spelling and grammatical errors and it interrupts the narrative flow on several occasions.  There are several pictures throughout the book, but the reproductions are poor.  I would prefer to pay a few extra dollars for a glossy center section with better prints of the photos.<br />If you have more than a passing interest in the subject I recommend this book.  Despite its flaws it is an easy and informative read.	2004-04-14

The author gives a somewhat detailed history of the Latter Day Saints from its founding by Joseph Smith in 1830 in New York, to its various moves across the country until the Saints finally settle down in the Utah territory, often leaving carnage in their path.<br />It is a history of various splinter groups from the LDS Church.  A number of former LDS members were excommunicated for their stance on polygamy and founded their own sects (and towns in some cases) that developed into mini-theocracies.  It is from one of these groups that the Lafferty family arises.<br />It is an analysis the Lafferty murders and how the faith of the murderers is involved.<br />The author uses these elements and violence surrounding them to tie the brutality of the murders to their faith.  It is not always an effective treatment as the constant jumping back and forth between settings is occasionally jarring, causing a reader to lose his or her place.<br />The LDS were somewhat radical when founded and their even more conservative splinters even more so.  The book is not an indictment of the Latter Day Saints, but of relgious fundamentalism in general.  That these groups can produce people capable of the brutality committed by the Laffertys is reason enough to give pause, whatever the religion.<br />There is much information in this book.  Pay careful attention when reading and you will get a lot out of it.	2003-12-31

Richard Peck has weaved a story that is well written, extremely interesting, believable and relevant.  <br />Engagingly narrated in the first person by main character Todd Tobin, the book reveals the Tobins to be crafted as an All-American family.  They are not perfect, however, in the vein of Leave it to Beaver or Ozzie and Harriet.  This family has its flaws, questions its actions and makes mistakes.  You can easily believe that they are based on a real family.<br />In addition to the excellent writing and characterization, the text touches on some alarmingly real and modern issues facing families today.  One of the Tobin family helps organize an AIDS seminar which is virtually ignored by the conservative community.  Todd's best friend has an alcoholic mother.  The Tobin's babysitter is from a religious fanatic family and has corrupted the youngest daughter's mind in a way that borders on child abuse.  Several members of the community are trying to ban books from the school library because they do not show Christianity in a superior position to other religions.  Mr. Peck does not resolve all these issues and there aren't any easy answers, just like real life.<br />These are all important issues that touch the livesof all.  Everyone should be required to read this book.	2003-12-29

In many cases the provisions of this law come in direct conflict with several of the first ten amendments and give our government, specifically the executive branch, frighteningly broad powers over the citizenry it is supposed to serve.<br />Particulary scary is the President's new power to hold people indefinately without charging them, without access to attorneys and without the knowledge of anyone, including their family.  The comparisons to Abraham Lincoln's suspension of the writ of habeous corpus during the Civil War are inevitable.  However, the strugle to hold our country together had a distinct end, which is something the current administration's war on terror lacks.  The executive branch may hold this power forever.<br />Mr. Hentoff extends his analysis to &quot;Patriot Act II&quot; which has not yet been passed, but could grant this power against U.S. citizens.  He examines other portions of the bills which allow the siezure of property merely on suspicion, rather than reasonable evidence and the installation of the &quot;magic lantern&quot; into peoples' computers, allowing government agencies to track all activity without their knowledge.  Your records from public libraries and booksellers may be seized and examined not only without your knowledge, but the acts make it illegal for these organizations to tell you the records have been accessed.  The U.S. government is slowly removing many of the protections that make the United States unique and free.<br />As quoted from the third season of The Simpsons, &quot;The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.&quot;  This book arms you with the knowlege to help protect your freedoms.  It is a quick and gripping read.	2003-12-29

These pulp collections of modern mythology helped me through a sometimes extraordinarily mundane childhood with my sanity intact. In fact, my closet has several large boxes filled with several thousand of them. Even at 32 year of age, I refuse to give them up.<br />Stan Lee is Marvel Comics. From the Second World War to today, he has given us a slate of unparalled heroes to adorn with wonder. He saw Marvel grow from a little pubisher called Timely in the 40s, survive attacks from parent groups in the 50s, the rebirth of the superhero in the 60s, and the emergence of a unique artform in 80s, 90s and today.<br />The book is so-so. Stan Lee has led an interesting life, to be certain, but there are no sex scandals, drug addiction, alcoholism, embezzlement or any of those other things that tend to make biographies best sellers today. In some ways, he is a goody-goody and he writes the book like one of his comic stories without the juicy material it needs to make it truly thrilling.<br />I don't want to turn anyone off, but if you are looking for things like Joan Collins rape at age 17 or Elizabeth Taylor's multiple stormy marriages,this isn't for you. Rather this provides a unique and invaluable historical record of the a part of history that is ignored by traditional outlets. Comic books are firmly entrenched in history, but are just starting to be realized as a legitimate art and literary form. Marvel has a colorful history, staring out as a private publishing company, being sold from company to company, going public after being taken over by buyout king Ron Perelmen in 1989. Financial mismanagement nearly destroyed the company in the mid-90s and it is just starting to recover.  This is where the biography's true value lies.<br />Stan Lee always felt that Marvel had the potential to become the next Disney. With the success of Spider-Man in the movies, which has broken $800 million worldwide, as of this writing, that prediction mayyet come true.	2003-11-24

He provides an excellent historical background including a detailed description of the drafting of the U.S. Constitution's first amendment.  Prior drafts of the amendment provide very interesting reading.  He correctly examines the effect of the 14th amendment that extended the Bill of Rights to the states and the fact that it was legal for states to set up religion up to that point.<br />Crucial Supreme Court cases are covered in detail providing excellent examinations of the opinions they generated.  He points out that church state separation was virtually ignored during the 19th century and exploded as an issue when immigration during the 20th century brought a number of new religions to the country that the people had never previously encountered.<br />Mr. Boston does not hide his disdain for the Religious Right and it becomes very obvious in some of his statements, but he illuminates some of the dangers this small but very influential group pose.  He exposes the desires of some extreme fringes to convert America into a Christian theocracy.<br />All in all this is a great work with thorough documentation of sources that allow a reader to research further into the issue.  Mr. Boston also provides a number of historical documents in whole or in part to illustrate the mindset of the founding fathers, particularly Thomas Jefferson and James Madison.	2003-11-08

The authors' attempts at analysis are brief and shallow.  The lack of footnotes or endnotes make deeper investigation difficult to impossible.  The authors are unable to keep the text chronological, especially in the transition from the 19th to the 20th century.  In any text like this, it is expected to jump back occasionally, but they should be brief with the past event's impact thorougly discussed and analyzed in its proper place in the timeline.  Here, the events are discussed at random.<br />The book's two best features occupy the last quarter of the text.  The first is a chronolgy of events since 1492.  The second is a list of suggested further reading.  <br />Overall, the book is worthwhile as an introduction to the subject and to get a feel for the role of relgion in America's history, development and progress, but you will want to eventually supplement it with a more carefully organized and credited work.	2003-11-05

The author contends we don't need a shadow government, but rather a sunshine government.  He doesn't make much of a case in either direction.  The book is rather lackluster and the absence of any footnotes, endnotes or bibliography make it frustrating.  It is impossible to even use this book as a starting point to continue research about the topic.<br />It was a fun read, but the last third of the book is the actual texts of three executive orders which led to the creation of the agencies that comprise the shadow government and its predecessors.  If you like to read legal code then you will like this, otherwise it is rather dry.  The space could better have been used more carfully debate the need for a shadow government on a point by point basis, or omitted to reduce the price of the book.	2003-09-29

While a number of The Spectre stories follow a pattern, they are told with a panache lacking in most other comics of the day.<br />The Spectre is a slain police detective whose spirit is returned to earth to rid it of crime.  The very concept makes it the most original character of its time.  Jerry Siegel, half of the duo that created Superman, uses this extraordinary concept to explore the idea of a hero with no real limitations and takes us places no other writer in the 40s thought of.  The Spectre faces his enemies with an amazing battery of powers, sometimes just willing them out of existence.  He travels to other planets, even other dimensions.  <br />Bernard Bailey's illustration, while not spectacular, holds up to just about any other artist of the day, with the possible exception of Bill Everett.  The costume he created for The Spectre is unusual, break the unwritten rule of the era.  Heroes were always dressed in primary colors and villians in seconday.  The Spectre is garbed in green and white.  It is suitably erie for a rather creepy character.  (Green Lanten would later break this rule as well, dressed in a tacky orange, green and purple ensemble.)<br />This is actually some of the best the golden age of comics has to offer.	2003-05-10

Heck, he's been brutalized throughout his childhood and when his family finds him, they shoot his girlfriend right in front of him.  Of course that's not the end, because God himself brings her back, and then they have an argument.  <br />Truly the ultimate in blasphemy, this book is a roller coaster of action and drama.  You rarely find characterization done so well in this medium.  You really get to know the central characters and what drives them.  Ennis shows what a truly great writer he is. Dillon's artwork shines its bloody best here.  The realistic depictions are tempered with a cartoon feel that lend a surrealistic quality that perfectly compliments the story and creating a symphony of sequential art.<br />It's more brutal than the first book and it certainly isn't for everyone.  But if you want to enjoy a comic that goes where no other comic has gone before, you owe it to yourself to check it out.	2003-05-10

That was a mistake on my part that I realized when I finally picked it up and read it.<br />The writers of this excellent series have smartly chosen to keep story arcs fairly brief lasting about five issues.  This allows each trade paperback to contain two arcs.  The two in this volume are excellent.<br />The first arc finds the JSA being attacked by the Injustice Society and Johnny Sorrow.  The Flash winds up accidently travelling back in time to ancient Egypt in his efforts to defeat Sorrow.  (Time travel isn't something treated lightly like in Dr. Who.)  This ties the two arcs together nicely and also relates the origins of three legends: Dr. Fate, Captain Marvel and Hawkman.  <br />Other surprises wait as Black Adam joins the JSA and the exploration of Hawkman and Hawkgirl's relationship deepens.  Kendra discovers she's really Hawk's wife reincarnated, but everything isn't peachy keen.  All in all, it's well written and art is top notch.  Enjoy!	2003-03-28

JSA is one of the best comic titles in print today.  This volume collects the first issues of the series.  DC has taken its classic hero team introduced during the 40s and modernized it with extraordinary flair.<br />While steeped in history, Goyer has written this story arc so the reader isn't required to be versed in 60 years of comic adventures.  References to the past are made where necessary or flashbacks are cleverly used and well integrated into the story.  The story itself is spectacular as these retired heroes, attending the funeral of an old friend, decide to reform the world's first super team to search for the next Dr. Fate.  <br />Sadowski's art is simply breathtaking.  There is astounding attention to detail that brings the illustrations alive.  He also gives a realistic picture of these aging super beings.  They have been around for decades and a paunch here and a wrinkle thrown in there are in sharp contrast to the typical pysically perfect, six pack abs hero that never seems to age.<br />Not only would I highly recommend this book, but its follow up trade paperbacks and the series itself.  This dip into history is time well spent.	2003-03-26

With no previous knowledge of the book's popularity, I thought it was well written, but needed to be fleshed out some more. Too many loose ends, who was thats, why did that happens were left by the end of the tale.<br />The art was well done, but would have served better as a set of paintings than illustrating a piece of sequential art. The artist attempts to supress the background in order to tell the story through the characters, but ultimately fails when this ultra-surrealistic style winds up disrupting the story's flow more than enhancing it.<br />All in all it is an interesting read, but not worth the price.	2003-03-26

Wrapped in an extremely well written story and uncompromising, brutal art this tome shines with its outrageous originality.  <br />The offspring of a forbidden union between an angel and demon bonds with a Texas minister giving him power rivaling that of the almighty, who learns that God has gone missing and sets off to find him.  He is aided in this quest by his ex-girlfriend turned hitwoman and a vampire.<br />Expect the body count to rise to unbelievable levels when the angels in hevean awaken the Saint of Killers to track him down and kill him, and an old friend of the vamprie turns out to be a serial killer.  New York's unluckiest cop and its kinkiest set out to put a stop to it all.<br />This is one of the most original creations to come out of the comic industry in many years.  It's violent, vulgar, no holds barred storytelling.  The characters have no restraint in their quest and this makes it a forbidden fantasy we've all longed to enjoy.	2003-03-20

It collects the original Strange Tales run from issue 110 (1963) to issue 168 (1968).  It is a monumental collection of some of the most inspired, fantastic and downright weird comic stories ever written. <br />My only complaint about this volume is the black and white presentation and the fairly cheap paper it is printed on.  Be careful when you handle this.	2002-10-07

The stories represented in this volume are some of the best in his almost 40 year career. <br />This collecton presents Engelhart and Brunner's tales from the early seventies, reprinting the tail end of Doc's run in Marvel Premiere and the beginning issues of his second solo magazine.  Englehart spins tales of the sorceror's most difficult times where he must make incredibly painful choices.  You will read as the doctor must choose between killing his mentor or allowing evil to overtake the planet, travelling back in time and witnessing history with a being who will become God, and finally, realizing that all things come to an end and even he will not win every battle.  Dr. Strange will die, only to be reborn more powerful than ever.<br />The dialog is as spectacular as the inspiring plot.  The Doctor's lines show him as somewhat disconnected and aloof, without being ridiculous like the Roy Thomas days of the late sixties.  This is as believable as comic fantasy gets.<br />Brunner's artwork is breathtaking.  He gives us a solid view of reality and manages to incorporate the weird and fantastic seamlessly.  It is truly a shame that these two are not working on the title today.  Barring the Stern/Rogers/Austen run in the early eighties, this is the best since the original Stan Lee/Steve Ditko stories.	2002-10-07

I was delighted that he did so.  I've heard of Mr. Sedaris, but, for some reason, never seemed to get around to reading his book.  Having read the works of his contemporaries such as Michael Thomas Ford, Joel Perry and Bob Smith.  Only Joel Perry rates as being funnier, but David Sedaris has certainly led a more interesting life.<br />I don't know if the title stems from his attempts to overcome a childhood lisp, or his attempts to learn French, either of which are pretty funny.  Mr. Sedaris' string of unusual jobs, performance art pieces, drug experiences and time in France with his boyfriend are all priceless and unique stories.  Listening to an international French class attempting to explain Easter to a Muslim student is priceless, and leads to a flashback to his Greek Orthodox upbringing and memories of holidays falling later than their Catholic equivelent.  Something that had frustrated me throughout my childhood.  <br />Unlike the other authors mentioned above, very little of the book is actually gay.  It just goes to show you gay men can have a life outside their sexuality.	2002-10-07

Dan Raviv's retelling of the Marvel Entertainment bankruptcy is one of the most riveting business books to come through the book publishers in a long time. I've been a fan of many of Marvel's characters and collected books throughout the seventies, eighties and early ninties. I was aware they had enjoyed a golden period in the mid nineties when the market value of Marvel grew to $3 billion. I knew they got into trouble right afterward. I never knew how close to the brink they came to non-existence.<br />Comic Wars tells the story of how a couple of billionaires saw value in a popular publisher, bought and fought over it, and nearly destroyed it. Like one of the books it published, Marvel was saved from extinction at the last moment by the wheeling and dealing head of a toy company. Many business books will tell you what happened, but never in the detail of this one. Comic Wars lets you get to know all the parties involved in intimate detail. These are a bunch of angry New Yorkers and the fight is very personal. Ron Perelman bought Marvel in 1989 for a mere $10 million of his own money and managed to grow the company through a series of acquisitions. Fleer, Skybox and Panini joined the company as subsidiaries, engorged the balance sheet, allowed Perelman to sell junk bonds against this inflated stock price, and the billionaire lined his pockets with the proceeds. The huge debtload of nearly $1 billion nearly sank the company when Carl Ichan joined the fray, at first looking like a white knight, but soon revealed his true colors in attempting to buy the company on the cheap by buying the distressed bank debt, bankrupting the company and wiping out the debt, converting his bonds to a controlling interest and selling the post-bankruptcy Marvel for a tidy profit.<br />In many ways this has numerous similarities to Barbarians at the Gate and the fight for RJR Nabisco between management and LBO legends KKR. The difference between that fight and this one is the interest inthe business involved. RJR was a corporate behemoth and neither side was willing to wring so much money out of it that it was no longer viable as a going concern. Perelman and Ichan both wanted to generate as big a pile of cash as possilbe without any concern for the business itself. Neither had a concern about the people who worked for Marvel. Had Perelman remained in charge of Marvel, we would never have seen Spider Man the movie with a $700 million to date box office gross. Perelman was only interested in generating hype about a movie and cashing in on that. Generating interest and then generating intangible value, cashing in and not delivering seems unethical to extreme. Destroying a company for its present value seems unethical in the extreme.<br />Even Ike Perlmutter, Marvel's eventual savior had ulterior and selfish motives. His royalty free in perpetuity license to make toys based on Marvel characters was at stake. He saved (and absorbed) Marvel to preserve this. In the end, things turned out alright and Marvel is slowly climbing its way back to health, but Dan Raviv's account tells of unbridaled greed. The book is a page turner and worth every penny.	2002-08-12

Now combine that with Jerry B. Jenkins who writes on a third grade (if that) level. Judy Blume develops toddlers better than this man develops full grown men and women. The book is all exposition that barely has a purpose. The double stories are carefully wrapped around each other so the more interesting sub plot of a newspaper reporters search for the truth behind millions of disappearances forces you to read the torturous tale of an airline pilot who finds God and Jesus and must convert the world like a one man army of Hare Krishnas. If this first in a series is any example, all the books can be condensed to a novella.	2002-08-09

With his fourth collection of essays, Michael Thomas Ford slips a little.  I found his previous books to be more consistant with his typical wit, humor and insight.  While the quality here is definately high and Mr. Ford certainly has his moments in this book, there are just too many essays that are serious.  Some are to the point of being somber.  &quot;Dress Rehersal&quot; is a prime example of this.  While I am in favor of the examinations that make up our queer lives, the book is supposed to be mostly funny, isn't it?<br />I am not discouraging the purchase of this book, since the writing is top notch.  Just don't expect the rollercoaster of laughs from the previous collections.	2001-11-18

I have never anyone with the ability to convey emotion through simply drawn, single panel cartoons with the deftness Mr. Martin displays.<br />Within a few pages Doc and Raider develop their very unique personalities and by the end of the book they feel like your best friends.  You will run a gamut of emotions while discovering these two characters' (pun intended) strengths and frailties.  Amid the humor and often hilarious situations are moments of seriousness and even crisis.  The ending isn't necessarily happy (it actually had me rather choked up), but you discover that love wins out in the end, even for two gay leathermen.<br />This is easily on a par with Tim Barela's Leonard and Larry.  You won't regret reading this.	2001-09-09

I work in a company that lives and dies by the instant commication known as email and didn't think I would find this funny.  I was intrigued enough by the unique approach to give it a shot, and it seemed like a pretty easy read.<br />It does take some time for the plot to get going and character development can be difficult while attempting to sound like genuine email.  Mr. Beaumont manages to pull it off.  You will recognize all the types of people to be found at any large firm, doing all the things we know they're doing, but no one talks about.  When you realize that every company runs like this you think it's a wonder that anything at all ever gets done.<br />It's saucy, it's crude, and it's loads of fun.  Get this book in one hand, a beer in the other, light the cigarette, and sit back and enjoy.	2001-06-29

The Promise of Eden starts as a gentle ghost story and develops into a full blown assault on the senses.<br />The book is worthy of comparison to Madeline L'Engle's &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; in terms of creativity and style.  Yet, the story is absent of Ms. L'Engle's preachiness and accepts all for who they are.  The first person narrative keeps us with the main character at all times and lets us experience the story as we all experience life, from our own eyes.  In a mere 204 pages, Mr. Durchholz crafts lives and worlds in a pace that never slows and made me unable to put the book down.<br />The author shows great promise with this work.
