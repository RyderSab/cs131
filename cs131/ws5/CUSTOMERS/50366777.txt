But if the ideas \\"people\\" and \\"street\\" and \\"Semi\\" and a mathematical formula partially derived from an English measurement system known as \\"eighty miles an hour\\" are accepted on face value as self-evident (instead of, say, calling it all an illusory, holographic manifestation of a single, static energy field), no one can argue the fact that unless those two people move out the way and fast, they are probably going to die.  The rules of Newtonian physics and Darwinian biology do not accompany or even color the philosophical discourse regarding the relationship of the things mentioned; they ENGENDER it.  Including, again, the idea that there are separate things (some alive, some not; some moving, some not, in an unalterable field of linear time) that are even being discussed.  This means that there are other \\"rules\\" to this \\"game\\" that are being called Nature.  A more or less hidden but unyielding, simple structure of rules; dictating the function of the obvious rules but misunderstood by the players as being ignorable aspects of reality.  And, as such, the players may believe they have no alternative but to play as the rules dictate--meaning, there are no other games to play.  Like chaos theory reveals, the seemingly infinite possibilities of any world are still based on a small set of premises regarding its place within an Ultimate reality.  One that not only makes the permutations within it superficial (if not illusory), but is itself, in its entirety, subject via paradigm shift to both re-interpretation and outright dismissal.<br /><br />The hidden rules of the games of modern society are no different.  And the behaviors they produce in our daily life, given the understanding of a set of otherwise hidden/unexplained set of rules, are also no different.  As such, the socio-political games as a whole can also be equally dismissed as non-representative of human potential.<br /><br />\\"...Chomsky's retort is 'but that wasn't really socialism...That was actually disguised capitalism'... The opposition begins to think, `stuff this for a joke - what's the fun of playing this game?'...\\"<br /><br />\\"...There are no conceivable facts you could present to Chomsky that would lead him to say, 'You know what? You're right! I've got this all completely wrong!'\\"<br /><br />What exactly does the reviewer I'm quoting mean by \\"facts\\" and the word \\"polemic\\"?  What is the source material for the political/economic/human nature beliefs he personally espouses?  Is it the historical literature of the dominant class, written for his schools; community; social class; nation; culture; in his language?  Is it the morning newspaper and newsmagazines, and television?  Is it the opinion of friends and educated professionals who formulated their opinions from the same or similar source material, without ever questioning neither its context, overall purpose or actual veracity?<br /><br />\\"Before reading Understanding Power, I knew of Noam Chomsky only by his (formidable) reputation as a linguist and author of Manufacturing Consent, which I had not (and still have not) read.\\"<br /><br />Interesting.<br /><br />\\"It is one thing to criticise, quite another to propose a constructive alternative - and... consensual, non coercive, state-free social planning ...just ain't it.\\"<br /><br />\\"...when the stooges in his audience...meekly suggest that his proposal for how to really manage an economy...has been tried in a few places, AND IT FELL APART PRETTY QUICKLY [emphasis mine]...\\"<br /><br />Wouldn't the military history of America since World War II, not to mention the no longer completely secret history of the CIA (see the work of William Blum, KILLING HOPE for just one encyclopedic example) say something different about socialism, communism, and the anarchism of \\"consensual, non coercive, state-free social planning\\" \\"falling apart pretty quickly\\" on the basis of its own structural/moral failures (see also Gore Vidal, PERPETUAL WAR FOR PERPETUAL PEACE)?

But it is important to recognize that PROFESSION OF NOBLE INTENT[by political and military leaders] IS PREDICTABLE AND THEREFORE CARRIES NO INFORMATION, even in the technical sense of the term. Those who are seriously interested in understanding the world will adopt the same standards whether they are evaluating their own political and intellectual elites or those of official enemies. One might fairly ask how much [American rhetoric] would survive this elementary exercise of rationality and honesty.\\"<br /><br />Noam Chomsky<br />HEGEMONY OR SURVIVAL:<br />AMERICA'S QUEST FOR<br />GLOBAL DOMINANCE<br />From Chapter Two:<br />\\"Grand Imperial Strategy\\"<br />(emphasis mine)<br /><br />THE CHOMSKY READER, redundant as it may sound, is great for the skeptical intellectual.  The kind who (for whatever reason) needs more than simply his investigative journalist/college professor credentials and source materials voluminously footnoted in every one of his books to accept the truth of what he has to say.  In fact, for those who would question his patriotism, given his penchant for speaking truth to power, this may be one of the most disturbing--and exhilarating--of his more than seventy books in print.  His laser-like, X-ray vision analysis of the covert brutality of American foreign policy--Orwellian Newspeak that accompanies it--is revealed to not just have a basis in grade school integrity, cutting edge linguistics and modern anarchism, but even moreso in the philosophical principles of the Enlightment: those funny ideas that gained popularity around when our Constitution was written.<br /><br />In one of the many essays that make up this collection, Chomsky quotes an English economist during the Cold War years that says America is not an enemy of Communism, but an enemy of DEVELOPMENT.  This can be considered, above and beyond all other themes that Chomsky routinely returns to in all of his books, to be the central one of this outing and perhaps the foundational message of his entire career. Throughout every essay in this volume, from about 1970 to 1988, Chomsky shows that American foreign policy has been centered around the prevention of any and all development around the world--economically and politically--that does not further facilitate American post-World War II imperialism.  Whether it be the repeated secret invasions and tacit military/economic support of death squads and dictators in Latin America and the Middle East, preventing democracy from flowering in these countries since (at least) the fifties...the myth of Chinese and Russian communism running the show in Vietnam, justifying the slaughter of millions of civilians and the destruction of their country's entire infrastructure (beginning to develop under their own brand of communism much better, and with less murders, than under the brutal French colonial system of the fifties)...the use of the CIA and military to disrupt even the thought of pan-Asian, Indian or pan-African coalitions producing an economic unity/development agenda that leaves out the \\"interests\\" of Europeans and American corporations...all of American foreign policy since World War II, and much of it beforehand, is an expession of this golden rule: *prevent uncontrollable world development at any cost.*  And the phenomenal uses of the military abroad and propaganda at home, via the corruption of the media and our intellectuals, facilitate the total control this state dynamic has on our national character and public mind.<br /><br />The core of this book's brilliance is revealed via Chomsky's revealing of the philosphical foundations of his world view.  It is like reading a political version of the movie ADAPTATION.  He shows under no uncertain terms how this *prevent development* rule in American politics, driven by military force, affects all of us.  But more importantly, he shows his political philosophy's roots in modern anarchism to be, in themselves, the next phase in the natural developmental path of the democratic principles of the Enlightenment of the 18th century; something that sounds inmpossible only because such intellectual, moral and social development WITHIN our culture has been all but stamped out by the modern American Police State to the same degree basic human rights, democracy and economic development is being stamped out of so many countries outside of it for most of this century.<br /><br />Is it possible to use Marxian analysis without being a Marxist--in fact, ripping apart Marxist hypocrisy in practice while using it--in a blistering critique of American hypocrisy?  Is it possible to make such historical events as the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s revelvant to the families of fallen soldiers in an illegal and immoral war with today's Iraq?  Is it possible to do all this in a way that makes one's love of the real American spirit joyfully obvious?  And can it be done in a way that won't put the average person to sleep?

These folks chose to serve an institutional authority in exchange for a paycheck, and these folks are going to be with you for the rest of your life, and you actors and writers and people who come up off the street, who live without certainty day to day and year to year are going to have to bear with being called children by these institutional types...It is not childish to live with uncertainty, to devote oneself to a craft rather than a career, to an idea rather than an institution.  It's courageous and requres a courage of the order that the institutionally co-opted are ill equipped to perceive.  They are so unequipped to perceive it that they can only call it childish, and so excuse their exploitation of you.<br /><br />\\"...Any system built on belief functions through the operations of guilt and hypocrisy.  Such a system, whether of acting training, meditation, self-improvement, etc., functions as a psuedo-religion, and is predicated on the individual's knowledge of his or her own worthlessness.  The system holds itself out as the alleviator, cleanser, and redeemer of the guilty individual.\\"<br /><br />\\"...The Stanislavsky 'Method,' and the techniques of the schools derived from it, is nonsense.  It is not a technique out of the practice of which one develops a skill--it is a cult.<br /><br />\\"Concetration cannot be forced.  It is a survival mechanism and an adaptive mechanism, and it will not stand down and stop making its own connections simply because we'd like it to.  Acting, finally, has nothing whatever to do with the ability to concentrate.  The ability to concentrate flows naturally from the ability to do something interetsing.  Choose something interesting, legitimately intesreting to do, and concentration is not a problem.  Choose something less interesting and concetration is impossible.<br /><br />\\"...If you decide to become an actor, stick to your decision.  The folks you meet in supposed positions of authority--critics, teachers, casting directors--will, in the main, be your intellectual and moral inferiors. They will lack your imagination, which is why they became bureaucrats rather than artists; and they will lack your fortitude, having elected institutional support over a life of self-reliance.

The economic program of American Conservatives, if enacted in its entirety, would devastate the middle class while helping the American overclass [aka the ruling elite]. Income would be redistributed upward, while taxes would be redistributed downward.... How can conservatives expect to win votes for an economic program so inimical to the middle class? The answer is they cannot--and they know it. Therefore, most conservative ideologues... have done their best to change the subject from the economy to what they like to call, 'the culture'...\\"<br /><br />\\"If further proof is needed for my contention that much of today's conservative political theory is merely Marxism with the substitution of `bourgeois' for `proletariat' and `culture' for `class,' it can be found in [the] call for enlisting art and literature in the service of Republican conservatism, a program that is indistinguishable, except in its content, from the aesthetic orthodoxy of American [communist] communities during the 1920's and 1930's...\\"<br /><br />\\"American conservatism, then, is a countercommunism that replicates, down to rather precise details of organization and theory, the communism that it opposes...\\"<br /><br />Michael Lind, UP FROM CONSERVATISM<br /><br />From Chapter Three, \\"The Triangular Trade: How the Conservative Movement Works\\" and Chapter Ten, \\"Soaking the Middle: The Conservative Class War Against Wage-Earning Americans\\"<br /><br />\\"Similar questions [to Woodrow Wilson's WW I writings that \\"most men are (now) servants of corporations\\" in an America \\"very different from the old\\"] are very much alive in the international arena today....A century ago, corporations were granted the rights of persons by radical judicial activism, an extreme violation of classical liberal principles. They were also freed from earlier obligations to keep to specific activities for which they were chartered. Furthermore...the courts shifted power upward from the stockholders in a partnership to the central management, which was identified with the immortal corporate person. Those of you familiar with the history of Communism will recognize that this is very similar to the process that was taking place at the time, very much as predicted, in fact, by left-Marxist and anarchist critics of Bolshevism. People like Rosa Luxemburg warned early on that the centralizing ideology would shift power from working people to the party, to the central committee, and then to the maximal leader, as happened very quickly after the conquest of state power in 1917, which at once destroyed every residue of socialist forms and principles...\\"<br /><br />\\"It's quite natural that a dismantling of the post-[World War II] economic order should be accompanied by a significant attack on substantive democracy--freedom, popular sovereignty, and human rights--under the slogan TINA (There Is No Alternative). It's kind of a farcical mimicry of vulgar Marxism. The slogan, needless to say, is self-serving fraud. The particular socioeconomic order that's being imposed is the result of human decision in human institutions. The decisions can be modified; the institutions can be changed. If necessary, they can be dismantled and replaced, just as honest and courageous people have been doing throughout the course of history...<br /><br />\\"The propagandists on both sides prefer a different story for self-serving reasons, but I think that's the more accurate one.\\"<br /><br />Noam Chomsky<br /><br />ROGUE STATES<br /><br />From essays \\"Power in the Domestic Arena\\"<br /><br />and \\"Socioeconomic Sovereignty\\"<br /><br />This Chomsky book, as another reviewer mentioned, may be best suited for those already familiar with his work.

They are all built upon the introductory essay chapter from which the book's title is derived.

Truth becomes 'at home' in you...therefore if you know the Truth of God, you will be free from lies binding you...Satan is an expert at lies, deceptions and fears, knowing the Truth will allow you to walk victoriously.\\"<br /><br />Dr. Henry Malone<br />SHADOW BOXING<br />Chapter 7: \\"Holding\\" and<br />Chapter 8: \\"The Fourteen Root Spirits\\"<br /><br />\\"It is ironic yet inescapable that the greatest Christian of modern times never embraced Christianity.\\"<br /><br />Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.<br />on the Mahatma Mohandas Gandhi<br /><br />The simple beauty and timeless wisdom in this fascinating and potent book SHADOW BOXING are as clear, obvious and spiritually nutritious as the convoluted collection of racist mythology, bipolar anti-Semitism and unapologetic witchcraft which accompanies it is spiritually harmful.<br /><br />His listing of the \\"Fourteen Root Spirits\\" that bind a soul otherwise full of joy in the bosom of God to the devil begins with the \\"Spirit of Infirmity\\".  In it he includes diseases such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, sinus problems and the (somewhat misogynistic) generalization \\"female problems.\\" Most of these, however, have been linked to the following for decades now: 1) the booming sugar, fast food and tobacco industries and their disease-inducing products, 2) the public relations companies spawned for the express purpose of misinforming the public about the harm those products cause the body, and 3) the congressional lobbyists who see to it that no politician can get elected by pushing laws regulating their distribution for the health and welfare of the country.  Yet he never once mentions the spirits of \\"Lying\\" and \\"Whoredoms\\" (\\"love of money\\"; \\"seduction\\"; \\"lust for position\\"; \\"placing anyone or anything [like Mammon] before God\\") serving as the foundation for not just much of our military empire economy, but for all of these multi-billion dollar corporations and the misery they have produced for millions of Christians around the world.  Through silence, he becomes complicit with corporate sin.<br /><br />Dr. Malone speaks of exorcising demons and spirits repeatedly (in, ironcially, the same way African \\"witch doctors\\" do it).  Interestingly, however, while painting a 19th century missionary's picture of the Godless jungle people of Africa  to make unrelated points about curses and spirits, he conveniently never mentions Apartheid; Nelson Mandela; the University of Ghana in Legon; the culturally sophisticated quasi-westernized upper Middle Class (and oil fields) of Nigeria; or the millions of African Christians--including Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Bishop Tutu--who would have serious issues with his entire Christian perspective. He supports through myth and silence a willfully ignorant, simplistic and immoral view of Africa and all of its people that is definitively unGodly.<br /><br />The word \\"racism\\" appears just once in the entire book, unexplained.  He does not even repeat it for the index.<br /><br />The entire histories of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Confucianism,  (by default) the Enlightenment (which, via the non-Christian Founding Fathers of our nation, produced our Constitution) and all of the scientific and social innovation derived from them all--which we modern Christians both depend on and take for granted--is also flushed down the toilet as demonic for Malone with one phrase: \\"Eastern religions\\" (\\"Spirit of Divination\\", pg. 126).  So embracing the heart of Gandhi (Satyagraha), for example, for how it reflects the heart of Christ (The Golden Rule) is out of the question for him.<br /><br />Regarding Judaism: Malone essentially says it is right to hate the Jewish people andtheir religion in your heart, but wrong to express it openly in words (even though the Christ, who quoted an OT psalm while on the cross, never forsook his Jewish origins); for they are (still) the chosen people of God (compare chapter 6 to 8). And while never bothering to make any distinctions between ancient and modern Jews; Aryan/Ashkenazic, Arab and African/Falasha Jews; Israeli and European/American Jews; or the Israeli people and the Israeli military, he never bothers to explain the moral contradictions of his beliefs when they occur--sometimes in the same chapter.<br /><br />The amount of critical thinking necessary to uncover problems like these throughout this book is minimal.  Malone, however,  makes \\"intellectualism\\" and \\"false teaching,\\" despite his pursuing and earning what we are led to believe is a Doctorate in Theology,  more sins against God (#14: the \\"Spirit of Error\\"). Much like the corrupt Popes and Bishops who harassed the father of Protestantism Martin Luther (not to mention Galileo), Malone, it seems, plays the demon card as a pre-emptive strike whenever it suits him politically.

And while never bothering to make any distinctions between ancient and modern Jews; Aryan/Ashkenazic, Arab and African/Falasha Jews; Israeli and European/American Jews; or the Israeli people and the Israeli military, he never bothers to explain the moral contradictions of his beliefs when they occur--sometimes in the same chapter.     The amount of critical thinking necessary to uncover problems like these throughout this book is minimal.  Malone, however,  makes \\"intellectualism\\" and \\"false teaching,\\" despite his pursuing and earning what we are led to believe is a Doctorate in Theology,  more sins against God (#14: the \\"Spirit of Error\\").

However, what this book intrinsically lacks is similar to that of all the others (Lefkowitz, Walker, Howe, et al.); that, like John the Baptist would say regarding Christ, aren't worhty of shining the shoes of this one.<br /><br />What the writers of all of these kinds of books purposely fail at noticing is the inherent intellecual limitations of historiography in its entirety.  The subject matter is continuously devalued when its scientific, not cultural, foundations are ignored.  Afrocentric thought is a window to long discredited and ignored schools of scientific disicpline; ignored and discredited purely for the sociopolitical agendas of 19th century colonialism and Imperialism gone mad.  Without us looking at these sciences anew, we are basically arguing over how many Black angels can stand on the head of a pin.<br /><br />Three books in particular must be paid attention to, for the sciences they reveal--historical astronomy and linguistics.<br /><br />First, two representing historical astronomy: the French 19th century astronomer Dupuis' LES ORIGINE DES TOUT LES CULTES (The Origin of All Cults) and the English Sir J. Norman Lockyer's DAWN OF ASTRONOMY are two of the most cited books by the rogue scholar Martin Bernal (author of the contraversial BLACK ATHENA: THE AFROASIATIC ROOTS OF CLASSICAL CIVILIZATION) that his detractors, such as Mary Lefkowtiz (NOT OUT OF AFRICA; BLACK ATHENA REVISITED) puposely never mention in their diatribes against him. Lockyer, the 19th century English mathematician and astronomer (that's scientist; not historian or literary scholar--the source of most of the Eurocentric school of Classicism), did in his time the unthinkable for a scholar in a field that gradually depended upon scholarship devolved into non-scientific dogma: he came up with a theory about the intellectual, scientific and spiritual life of a pre-Hellenic culture in north Africa that went completely against the accepted truisms of common Egyptological opinion... and then proved it, scientifically and mathematically, to be right. Under no uncertain terms, Lockyer--even within the context of the prejudices of his time--completely revolutionized how a north African civilization, whose way of life predates the scientific, mathematical and cultural re-discoveries of the Greeks by thousands of years could be perceived.<br /><br />Ancient Egypt is shown in THE DAWN OF ASTRONOMY to be a civilization based on a philosophical foundation that made cutting edge science, advanced mathematics and esoteric religion one. Pythagorean and Euclidean geometry; the Fibonacci series; the golden section; Pi; the astronomical phenomenon known as the Precession of the Equinoxes (named by the ancient Greeks the \\"Socratic Year\\" some millenia later); the exact length of the solar year, within less than fifteen minutes; the foundational concepts and mathematical formulae of geodesy.... It is all not just written within ancient Egyptian writings, but exemplified in the architecture of every sacred temple built in Egypt from before the Pharonic period (3100 B.C.) on through the Pyramid Age and onward past the Valley of the Kings--millenia before the birth of Pythagoras, Euclid or the entirety of Greece as a culture. Their entire culture, from language to architecture, danced to the rhythm of the stars.<br /><br />Lockyer shows this with an unprecedented detail that to my knowledge has yet to be surpassed.<br /><br />Next, is linguistics: Chek Anta Diop and THE AFRICAN ORIGINS OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION.<br /><br />Diop breaks AFRICAN ORIGIN into the following chapters:<br /><br />I- Preface: The Meaning of our Work<br /><br />1) What were the Egyptians?<br /><br />2) Birth of the Negro Myth<br /><br />3) Modern Falsification of History<br /><br />4) Could Egyptian Civilization have originated in the Delta?<br /><br />5) Could Egyptian Civilization Be of Asian Origin?<br /><br />6) The Egyptian Race as Seen and Treated by Anthropologists<br /><br />7) Arguments Supporting a Negro Origin<br /><br />8) Arguments Opposing a Negro Origin<br /><br />9) Peopling of Africa from the Nile Valley<br /><br />10) Political and Social Evolution of Ancient Egypt<br /><br />11) Contribution of Ethiopian-Nubia and Egypt<br /><br />12) Reply to a Critic<br /><br />13) Early History of Humanity: Evolution of the Black World<br /><br />II- Conclusion<br /><br />Diop, an African physicist and linguist, uses a scientific study of African linguistics to find the obvious connections between African languages in central and western Africa and the ancient hieroglyphs, demotic and coptic of Egypt.

A person could easily be led astray as to what significance this book has by looking at it from an *opinion* perspective--\\"right-wing/left-wing\\"--without the clarity of context.  In fact, the three things people should know about this book by Linda McQuaig is the following, in order of importance:<br /><br />3) The United States Freedom of Information Act of 1975 has made all kinds of otherwise classified documents of the Pentagon and earlier Presidential administrations available to any historians or investigative journalists with the actual interest of knowing just how the world has worked in the past and continues to work for those running it today.  McQuaig's source material is not a collection of out of touch flower-child opinions gained from smoking too much pot and listening to too much Jimi Hendrix, nor a metaphoric use of a Freudian projection/transference regarding some undistinguished paternal child abuse.  It is these Pentagon papers--political, economic and military in nature--combined with the truism of Iraq's oil fields being second in volume of product only to Saudi Arabia's in the world and the agenda of the current American administration (which has been in the world news for several years now) that form the basis of her research and source material.<br /><br />2) Dr. Noam Chomsky, head of linguistics and philosophy at MIT; considered one of the most important intellectuals of the 20th and 21st century since Einstein; a man whose books--the latest being HEGEMONY OR SURVIVAL--routinely make the bestseller's list of papers around the world, despite his total censorship from American newspapers and television, has given this book the most impassioned review I have personally ever heard or read him give anything.  This includes the work of some of his best friends, like Howard Zinn (A PEOPLE'S HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES) and the late Edward Said (ORIENTALISM).  Most authors of \\"the dissident literature,\\" like Ahrundati Roy, Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed, Tanya Reinhart and William Blum are happy with a kind blurb on their books from Chomsky, the Godfather of speaking truth to power.

A writer who has a magnificent subject like Dr. May Chinn, MD--the polymath first Black Female Doctor of Harlem who comes of age during the Harlem Renaissance--could easily be enticed into putting her genius into the first chapter or so and coasting through the extrarodinary life of her subject like a census bureau or FBI chief about to accost a witness thereafter; letting the great life (sort of) speak for itself.  But Ms. Haulsey turns virtually every sentence of her fictional retelling of this nonfictional inspirational life into an interconnecting poem, linked together to every other sentence so neatly and artistically that her subject matter comes alive, breaks your heart and lifts your spirit as if she is a member of the family.<br /><br />I had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Hausley at a literary function in New York where I discovered her natural humility and grace--which invisibly reads through her style.<br /><br />This book is beautiful for so many reasons; the least of which, paradoxically enough, because of the incredible courage and life of the subject.

US	50366777	R20XS9P0KD2OMD	0952799413	811770453	The Atlantis Secret: A Complete Decoding of Plato's Lost Continent	Books	4	7	8	N	N	A paradigm shifting brilliant work that takes reading twice	Alan Alford has created an intellectual paradigm shift of such domino falling proportions with his books that it will probably take a decade at the absolute least before WHEN THE GODS CAME DOWN alone becomes recognized (or ignored) for the incredible service to world culture it is. THE ATLANTIS SECRET, focusing on the myth makying power of the ancient stories of Atlantis, builds upon this foundation brilliantly.<br /><br />We can read all of the New Age book work, New Perspective Archaeology, Popular Psychology and much of the scientific innovative literature so popular today in one or more of three contexts: the socio-economic (regarding cultural trends and publishing houses), the cultural/psychological reaction to technology and the Information Society, and one powerful other. That third one is simple, and is the unifying belief, stated or unconscious, of every author: regardless of the specific message of the individual book, we are witnessing the dawning of a future world where all our existential questions of spirituality, communication and those of the multi-discplinary sciences meld into one unified linguistical system of an answer. Alan Alford reveals in all of his books that that grand idea, generating such spiritual hopes for the future of the human species, is the mental architecture upon which the past 6000-plus years of human civilization is already based.<br /><br />In THE PHOENIX SOLUTION, Alford took a radical approach to the decoding of Egyptian religion and mythology to reveal its scientific underpinnings in a way unlike literally anyone before him. He said that the foundation of Egyptological thought and religion lay in their scientific theory of the evolutionary growth process of our entire solar system. Much of the foundational myths, gods and goddesses, he showed, symbolize the theorized outer planets of eons past and their process of raining meteoric bits of proto-life onto our Earth upon their explosion; effectively \\"seeding\\" our planet with the beginnings of new life unlike ever before. This foundational solar system-view, not just world view, generated the entire religious philosophy, scientific study, cultural practices and art of the culture for more than three thousand years.<br /><br />WHEN THE GODS CAME DOWN is Alan Alford's masterpiece in my opinion. Building on the Egyptological revelations of PHOENIX SOLUTION, he showed in the most remarkable scientific, archaeological and literary fashion how this foundational concept of the evolution of our entire solar system is the generating principle behind not just Egyptian religion but ALL ancient myth and religion; from that of Sumer to Babylon; Memphis to Peking; Athens to Jerusalem. He then showed how the great teachers of every age, like Socrates, Plato, and (yes) Jesus, were lauded as such because they knew, mastered and shared this foundational concept of truth in the context of its specfic cultural, linguistic and psycho-mythic implications--though they still did so in such a way that only the most knowledgeable and spritually initiated would fully grasp its implications. In short, Alford reveals the one sublime, ancient religion UNDERNEATH the many modern world religions as we have come to know them, in their \\"dumbed down\\" form; from Christian fundamentalism to Ancient Astronaut/Extraterrestrial fundamentalism. In so doing, he reaffirms the majesty and metaphorical human truth within them all.<br /><br />With THE ATLANTIS SECRET, however, he takes this paradigm-shifting theory and focuses it, like a laser, onto the mind of Plato.  In so doing he reveals what may be the greatest theory explaining what Plato was actually trying to tell the world in the TIMAEUS that we have yet heard.  Through which, he reveals what may be the actual anthropological/scientific foundation for the entire philosohpical history of ancient Greece--and, by default, our modern world.<br /><br />My test for the far reaching influence and power of any theorist--particularly of the wannabe revolutionary kind--is three-fold. One, their theory must be completely plausible; i.e. not needing simple revolt from detractors and complimentary but poorly explained aspects of ITSELF to proclaim and rationalize its essential relevance. Two, it must have the ability to completely encapsulate the foundational principles, concepts and findings of the other competitive theories as a part of its own. And third, perhaps most important of all, it has to excite me. There may be things my mind will not be strong enough, educated enough, mutil-lingual enough or quick enough to pick up, but you cannot fool my heart.<br /><br />THE ALTANTIS SECRET, far from being out of print, continues to catch the attention of highly regarded academics for a reason: it passes all of these tests equally well, in a way that will change those who revere the achievements of ancient Greece forever.<br /><br />Not everyone is ready for a book like this.  It answers more questions than it raises. You will probably have to read it twice to fully grasp it all.  But try reading it, and looking at anything regarding culture, religion, the spirit and scientific news the same. I cannot recommend it enough.ist--particularly of the wannabe revolutionary kind--is three-fold.

US	50366777	R140OU6MMQCNI9	1401301185	190990371	To Love, Honor, and Betray: The Secret Life of Suburban Wives	Books	3	35	39	N	N	Demoralizing look at women, trust and monogamy	This book is about as upsetting as anything a man, married or otherwise, is likely to read this year. Even men who, like myself, have careers that when practiced almost definitively reveal the hidden sides of married women who take part in often scandalous affairs will be kicked in the stomach repeatedly by what they discover here. Publisher's Weekly said this book \\"demoralizes more than it enlightens.\\"  That, is an understatement.<br /><br />Without judging any of the women in particular, there are a few common themes that continuously resurface. One is the archetypal Biological Clock Woman who is so afraid of never becoming a mother that she never actually becomes an adult, and therefore never learns what love and intimacy as a wife is all about.  Several of the women admit (as their anonymity is insured by the women writers who chose and compiled these stories) that they never actually were in love with their husbands at any time.  They saw him as a \\"catch\\" of some sort that would make a good father--i.e., make them pregnant--before their ovaries stopped producing fertilizable eggs.  As they were pretending to be in love with their fianc&eacute;s right from the start, the deceit in their marriage started before it even began.  (Staying with their husbands afterwards was done, several said, almost purely for money and childcare-related reasons.  [And naturally they believed this little trivial point, given how all men are just sexual animals with no souls anyway, would not effect his sense of attraction or his love of being married to them on a daily basis.])  For these women in the book, the later affairs that are its subject are just a natural progression of an entire adult life of selfishness and deceit, fostered by a profound contempt for men in general.  Which I believe is the reason why they are, ironically, suffering little to no guilt from the actual act of the affairs (almost none express guilt over any of them), or the deception that follows.<br /><br />A second reoccurring theme in the book is women thinking like twelve year olds and being addicted to the pleasure principle associated with romance.  Anything even resembling talk about marriage being more like two architects putting on hardhats and standing in the middle of an unfinished structure they have pledged to build together is anathema to them. They went into the marriage wearing Walt Disney/Harlequin Romance rose-colored glasses, believing they had found a man who could make EVERYDAY feel like their dream vacation and the first day of their dream job combined with their dream honeymoon; something not even Jesus Christ and all twelve of the apostles could do for them if they wanted to. These women, in a choice between a) confronting the innate immaturity of this vision that they were holding their husbands responsible for bringing to life, and b) blaming their husbands for (of course) failing in the attempt, chose the latter nine times out of ten.  Though some actually admit their spouses didn't deserve such behavior or betrayals, for these women this irrational resentment STILL became the triumphant justification for many of the affairs that took place--and the double lives they lived afterwards.<br /><br />The most recurring theme of course is this: virtually none of the women in this book ever saw a problem with choosing not to actively discuss their innermost feelings on this specific issue with their husbands at any time. True, a couple of women did: they got stupid men who, running scared, ignored or judged them; setting themselves up to be cheated on in the end for their wife's troubles. But most of the women never admitted telling their husbands that the house is on fire was an option, before or after the affair.  The mixed messages and secrecy about their inner lives became the order of the day long before the orgasms with their secret lovers ever took place. SOME WOMEN, KNOWING THEIR DOUBLE LIFE, ACTUALLY RESENTED THEIR HUSBANDS FOR TRUSTING THEMAROUND OTHER MEN.  That in some cases is the only logical explanation for their husband's behavior when he was surreptitiously confronted by their wife with the man who, unbeknownst to him, actually replaced him in his marriage bed.  The excruciating choreography of a cuckolded husband's blind trust of his cheating wife (or his secretly hoping against hope after intuiting the evidence) some women conveniently redefined as evidence of his hateful arrogance: his belief that no other man would ever dream she was sexy and desirable and would take her away from him. Further justifying, in their minds, more non-communication, more secrecy, more resentment, more betrayal...and more lies.<br /><br />Naturally, there are several wonderful women in this book who are being emotionally and physically abused by their pathetic husbands. (I have no sympathy for those guys.) And there are those who (as to be expected) are survivors from deeply dysfunctional families: young rape victims; children of sexually abusive and absentee fathers; children of duplicitous, verbally abusive and emotionally indifferent mothers.  This, these women survivors grew to understand, was the true genesis of their issues with men, sex, communication, intimacy and integrity that put them out of control in their adult married lives.  (Adult Attention Deficit Disorder may in fact be the root cause with several of the others: see Dr. Edward Hallowell's amazing DRIVEN TO DISTRACTION.) Again, while a few women in the book do not inspire the least bit of non-judgmental understanding (considering the nightmare of a wife they had to have been before, during and after the affair), all women in the book ironically succeed in bringing you to terms with how hard marriage is.  And, how hard it is just to be human.  As such, the words forgiveness & understanding become what make you read page after page, until the (anticlimactic and uninspiring) end.<br /><br />This is a powerful, painful book that serves as a lesson for women--and a warning for men--everywhere. Know thyself, and marry well...or divorce, fast.HEM AROUND OTHER MEN.

US	50366777	R1X48M0Z7I01ZA	0684801280	168753818	Driven to Distraction: Recognizing and Coping with Attention Deficit Disorder from Childhood Through Adulthood	Books	5	19	24	N	N	Amazing; an experience of enlightenment about ADD & society	Not since William Dufty's SUGAR BLUES have I ever read a book that has answered virtually every unanswered question I have had, and every painful mystery about the contradictory facts of life: regarding everything from the nature of modern society to stupid habits I cannot seem to let go of in my personal life; the actual non-emotional source of my brilliant son's troubles in school to the secret architect of my intimate relationships with women throughout my adulthood.<br /><br />This book is not written for people who have never heard of Attention Deficit Disorder. This book is written--no, this book is a profound blessing--to people like me: people who have heard of it for quite some time, have children or family members or friends with it, and think because of such they actually know what it is, or what it does. People like me, who despite the facts above never consider, because they do not know what it really is, that they may have it themselves. My view of the stereotype of ADD and its stereotypically affected subculture (children with other neurological or educational differences in suburbia and the inner city) does not even begin to fully explain the most obvious and trivial of symptoms, let alone the actual racial and socioeconomic diversity of adults AND children who may be suffering with it, and for how long--in this generation and the many before us (like those of our parents and grandparents).<br /><br />=For example, consider this enlightening and disturbing fact that could change one's entire view of the morality of the criminal justice system: the brain of a person with ADD functions in an entirely different way than those without it, and as such is affected in an entirely different way by the use of illegal drugs. While \\"regular\\" people search for the high received by Marijuana, the relaxation of inhibitions by alcohol or the stimulus from Cocaine, those with ADD develop the ability not just to finally relax but also to CONCENTRATE; to FOCUS their minds and organize both their thoughts and their life--and subsequently their emotions--in a way the condition will not allow them to otherwise when they get high. In other words, as 10-15% of the population of major cities across America may have ADD (the busy lifestyle we tend to be attracted to), at the very least 25% of the prison population--people who got there because of their purchase and use of illegal drugs (like crack)--*were intuitively self-medicating for a disorder they did not and still do not know they have*. This is what the white kids with ADD in suburbia getting a slap on the wrist for what the black kids in the ghetto with ADD are going to prison for are BOTH doing, when they continuously experiment with illegal drugs.<br /><br />Which means, the TREATMENT over INCARCERATION argument in the \\"war on drugs\\" has more scientific validity than anyone in the booming prison industry, with all its congressional lobbyists, would ever admit; particularly when our more dysfunctional and often morally repugnant laws are being enforced.<br /><br />=Consider also that people with ADD also get addicted to simple sugars and carbohydrates for the same or similar reasons...and this could be partly behind the boom of obesity in America.<br /><br />=Then consider how routinely ADD is diagnosed in pre-pubescent boys (particularly those of color) but not in women and girls. And then take another look at everything from the constant worry of girls falling behind boys  in science and mathematics in school (and the sexist mythology often associated with the explanations for it), to the rising rate of obesity and eating disorders amongst women as opposed to men...<br /><br />The implications of this disorder's effect on our modern world however will still be thunder to the lightning affect of seeing how ADD just might explain the Hyde side of every Dr. Jekyll in your personal life--including yourself--under the surface of drug addictions, antisocial personality quirks, narcissism, verbal abuse, scholastic and professional underachievement and emotionally codependent & adulterous intimate relationships. I have had the experience of talking to several therapists (psychologists) over my adult life; read dozens of self-help books from Eric Berne to Nathaniel Branden to Melodie Beattie to Marianne Williamson to Ilanya Vanzant; scoured through much of the work of Freud and Jung and those influenced by them, including Joseph Campbell...all of them, particularly the psychologists, opened my eyes to significant ideas, perspectives and literature (like the work of the incredible Alice Miller, for example). ALL of it, however, and all of psychologists, missed this fundamental medical/neurological perspective, which gets to the root of all my problems AND my gifts simultaneously unlike anything I have ever seen.<br /><br />If you have any of the personality traits or life experiences the likes of which have been referred to in codependency theory, chemical addiction, underachievement (or just the strange, inexplicable feeling, as it goes against the evidence of your actual career/life successes, that you're still a failure in disguise), chronic depression, dyslexia associated reading & comprehension difficulties and the like (not to mention the wealth of racist, sexist and moralistic pseudo-scientific literature that speak in subtle but primitive terms of your innate criminality or inferiority; or just plain \\"sinful nature\\")...be prepared for the Galileo experience of your life. This book made me and the woman I love repeatedly burst into tears, as every chapter revealed a crucial but mysteriously painful aspect of our mutual childhoods, family and personal lives that we tried to forget, but now understand.<br /><br />The funniest thing: I first heard of the book more than seven years ago, and never got around to picking it up.<br /><br />Was too distracted!<br /><br />This book may have saved my life.onal underachievement and emotionally codependent & adulterous intimate relationships.

They finally become mired down in their own contradictions...after performing intellectual acrobatics as learned as they are unwarranted.

One cannot say with absolute certainty that a belief in an afterlife is a form of self-delusion. One can say with assurance, however, that no one knows for sure, because in all of recorded history no living mortal has returned to tell those who remained among the living exactly what happens on the other side.\\"<br /><br />Leonard Shlain<br />SEX, TIME AND POWER<br />From Chapter 19,<br />\\"Superstition/Laughter\\"<br /><br />\\"...The idea that the universe began in a single primordial explosion, or Big Bang, is accepted without question by most scientists. And this is odd because, although there are compelling reasons to believe that this is true, no one has ever proved this is true. On the other hand, if a near-death psychologist were to flatly state that the realm [Near Death Experience]-ers travel to during their experiences is an actual other level of reality, the psychologist would be attacked for making a statement that cannot be proved. And this is odd, for there are equally compelling reasons to believe this is true. In other words, science already accepts what is probable about very important matters IF those matters fall into the category of *fashionable things to believe*, but not if they fall into the category of *unfashionable things to believe*. This double standard must be eliminated before science can begin to make significant inroads into the study of both psychic and spiritual phenomena...\\"<br /><br />Michael Talbott<br />THE HOLOGRAPHIC UNIVERSE<br /><br/>The MD Dr. Leonard Shlain's SEX TIME AND POWER is provocative.<br /><br />Shlain's foundational thesis is biochemical, not anthropological. The idea that the human *child* homo sapiens initiated our physical evolution is, though hardly new (see the work of Elaine Morgan for just one example), powerfully represented through his explanation of two things: 1) the new child's brain size, changing completely the process by which women give birth, and 2) the female need for iron (in the form of meat) that such a drastic change in the pregnancy and giving birth process demanded on the female human body, to make up for the mineral depletion. These two changes all but forced man, according to Shlain, to stand upright and hunt for woman to have meat.  WOMAN, in turn, invented everything from sex-strikes to cyclical time to regulate and manage this process.  Meaning, WOMEN ushered in the next stage of cultural and sexual evolution.<br /><br />His view of many things beyond that is faulty to say the least.  Though an obviously compassionate man who thinks much about injustice and the perils of misogyny in our culture, his writing reminds me of late Freud: innovative on the surface but both apologetic and representative of the status quo at its heart.  His novel ideas owe their existence to the anthropology of Karl Marx, Engels and Dr. Chris Knight of London (see BLOOD RELATIONS): all die-hard socialists who would dismiss much of his other findings (regarding the supposed inevitability of Patriarchy) as a myth of 19th century European capitalism/imperialism, projected onto an African prehistoric past.  (And, as I also expected, he quotes absolutely none of the Afrocentric anthropologists and Egyptologists who show his central theory to be both more than a century old and forming the cultural core beliefs of ancient African civilizations, from Egypt on down.)  Also, his describing of the psycho-cultural effect of man realizing the \\"certainty of death\\" reveals the \\"malignant defect\\" of his foundational \\"IF=THEN algorithm\\" for scientific study.

Some serious biases; but good nonetheless.iochemical, not anthropological. The idea that the human *child* homo sapiens initiated our physical evolution is, though hardly new (see the work of Elaine Morgan for just one example), powerfully represented through his explanation of two things: 1) the new child's brain size, changing completely the process by which women give birth, and 2) the female need for iron (in the form of meat) that such a drastic change in the pregnancy and giving birth process demanded on the female human body, to make up for the mineral depletion. These two changes all but forced man, according to Shlain, to stand upright and hunt for woman to have meat.  WOMAN, in turn, invented everything from sex-strikes to cyclical time to regulate and manage this process.    Meaning, WOMEN ushered in the next stage of cultural and sexual evolution.    His view of many things beyond that is faulty to say the least.  Though an obviously compassionate man who thinks much about injustice and the perils of misogyny in our culture, his writing reminds me of late Freud: innovative on the surface but both apologetic and representative of the status quo at its heart.  His novel ideas owe their existence to the anthropology of Karl Marx, Engels and Dr. Chris Knight of London (see BLOOD RELATIONS): all die-hard socialists who would dismiss much of his other findings (regarding the supposed inevitability of Patriarchy) as a myth of 19th century European capitalism/imperialism, projected onto an African prehistoric past.  (And, as I also expected, he quotes absolutely none of the Afrocentric anthropologists and Egyptologists who show his central theory to be both more than a century old and forming the cultural core beliefs of ancient African civilizations, from Egypt on down.)    Also, his describing of the psycho-cultural effect of man realizing the \\"certainty of death\\" reveals the \\"malignant defect\\" of his foundational \\"IF=THEN algorithm\\" for scientific study.  Like most traditional anthropologists, his understanding of Darwinian evolutionary theory relies on a debunked Newtonian view of the physical universe.

There were two ways to look at it.  Either the down low was new or the down low was old, but either way it did not make sense.  If the down low was new in 2001, it could not have been responsible for an epidemic that was twenty years old.  On the other hand, if the down low was old in 2001, then we should have been alarmed about HIV infection rates among black women ten to fifteen years earlier when the epidemic was raging out of control...<br /><br />\\"The AIDS community of funders, researches, activists...had a problem...some activists [in the early 90's] decided to market the epidemic for Middle America... 'There was definitely an effort to make AIDS more compelling to the Black community' [Phil Wilson] recalled, 'and that process entailed a de-gaying of the epidemic'...\\"<br /><br />Keith Boykin<br />BEYOND THE DOWN LOW<br />From Chapter Five<br />\\"When a Disease Becomes an Excuse\\"<br /><br />\\"Governor McGreeley [of New Jersey]'s wife must have been going through a full range of emotions the day she stood next to her husband at his press conference...McGreeley also admitted to 'an adult consensual affair with another man' which he said 'violates my bonds of matrimony'. That was the real bombshell...dropped that day...By announcing his affair with another man, Governor McGreeley...proved that the down low is not just a black thing...We should have known that black men were not the only ones who cheated on their wives.  Or had we bought into the myth of black male identity that constructs black manhood solely as pathology?\\"<br /><br />Keith Boykin<br />BEYOND THE DOWN LOW<br />From Chapter Four,<br />\\"It's Not Just a Black Thing\\"<br /><br />\\"I believe the recent trend toward demonizing those who are HIV positive for failure to disclose their HIV status sends the wrong signal.  It stems from our need to blame other people for our own failures, and it is based in an unhelpful concept of victim-based morality that takes away our personal responsibility and assigns all the blame and puts all the responsibility on those who are HIV positive.  Blaming someone else for our own actions will not change our actions, nor will it change the past.  By the time you get to the point of blame, you have already passed the point of responsibility.\\"<br /><br />Keith Boykin<br />BEYOND THE DOWN LOW<br />From Chapter Twelve,<br />\\"Let's Talk About Sex\\"<br /><br />Keith Boykin's heartfelt book BEYOND THE DOWN LOW: SEX, LIES AND DENIAL IN BLACK AMERICA is a scathing critique and passionate love letter to the Black community simultaneously.  Simply put, Boykin analyses the structural hypocrisy, denial and irresponsibility that lie at the core of the African-American conversations about class, sex, sexuality, honest communication & true intimacy in relationships, racism and AIDS.  It is his profoundly logical belief that these structural hypocrisies--concretized in Black culture by their deification in the fear-based, narcissistic linguistics of much of the Black church--combine with HIV to make any and all spreading of AIDS the seeming epidemic it has become in the Black community--not Black bisexual men in the closet (termed the \\"Down Low\\" community of brothers by J.L. King in his book).<br /><br />Boykin's analyses of the myths in the Black community, those of the dominant culture, the gay subculture in both communities and the immature beliefs regarding honesty, communication and sexual responsibility of many Black women in relationships that Boykin reveals are made more astounding by four things:<br /><br />1) his actual quoting of Center for Disease Control statistics on HIV and AIDS, the likes of which J.L. King purposely never quotes in his book (for reasons he describes that would have had him sued by King for libel by now if they weren't true)<br /><br />2) His candid revealing of his life and mores as a gay man and his advocacy for the gay community<br /><br />3) his blistering critique of both the character and motivation of J.L. King, on the basis of having spoken with him personally on several occasion, and<br /><br />4) the powerful critique and detailed analysis of the book, ON THE DOWN LOW; a book that Boykin reveals was not actually written by J.L. King, but by a professional Hollywood ghost writer he hired with the express purpose of creating a hysterical media buzz around the topic.<br /><br />The media hype on the subject of King's product was successfully achieved by this year (when King appeared on Oprah) for the benefit of (what else?) making money on the fears and emotional issues of Black women in particular and the latent racism of white people in general.  Nothing sells better than sex...except fear.  J.L. King used both to sell his product: ON THE DOWN LOW.  Truly, Boykin in BEYOND THE DOWN LOW shows that the whole \\"On the Down Low\\" phenomenon has been brought to hysteric proportions in an amazingly short amount of time in the exact same way the Classicist scholar/Reactionary Republican Mary Lefkowitz' uneven, politically biased and scientifically inaccurate critique of Afrocentrism called NOT OUT OF AFRICA did: it combines a topic of emotion-producing complexity (for Lefkowitz: the crisis of integrity in academia and ancient cultural research; for J.L. King: bisexuality in 21st century America) with another simplistic application of the 19th century *Black Buck/crazy Nigga/Mandingo* myth in modern times.<br /><br />J.L. King's book is still incendiary and important, because it reveals the closet bisexual phenomenon and its actual consequences to people in both the homosexual and heterosexual community (who didn't already know about it), when combined with deceit and HIV.  In fact, the only thing that could put ON THE DOWN LOW in its proper context, for the good of the Black community and the world at large, is BEYOND THE DOWN LOW by Keith Boykin.<br /><br />Read this soon; read it now.blistering critique of both the character and motivation of J.L.

The lionization of Robert Woodward since Watergate, while earned, has become woefully exaggerated in the 21st century.  The new Bob Woodwards, practicing real life-altering investigative journalism, are now being ignored by him; just as he was in the early 70s by the reporters in Nixon's back pocket.  Woodward's book PLAN OF ATTACK in that context, is, like all of his books, well-written. But, like ten percent real penicillin in a world where only full strength will cure a disease, the facts he leaves out--purposely--are frightening.<br /><br />\\"This [neoconservative] focus on reintegrating Iraq into the regional framework of order under US hegemony was no doubt heightened by the fact that Iraq challenged the US monopoly over the oil trade, maintained through the fact that oil transactions occur in US dollars. Since 1971...the dollar has...become the de facto world reserve currency... Overall, since the world economy is fundamentally oil-dependent, this...lends the US a dominant trading advantage...In November 2000, Iraq began trading its oil in euros, and profited handsomely in the process. Iran, Venezuela and Russia--all key oil producers--have also considered and/or moved towards switching to the euro...\\"<br /><br />Nafeez Mossadeq Ahmed<br /><br />BEHIND THE WAR ON TERROR<br /><br />From Part Two, Chapter Seven: \\"False Pretexts\\"<br /><br />\\"The real reason the Bush administration wants a puppet government in Iraq--or more importantly, the reason why the corporate-military-industrial network conglomerate wants a puppet government in Iraq--is so that it will revert back to a dollar standard and<br /><br />stay that way...\\"<br /><br />Wiliam Clark<br /><br />\\"The Real Reasons for the Upcoming War<br /><br />with Iraq: a Macroeconomic and<br /><br />Geostrategic Analysis of the Unspoken Truth\\"<br /><br />Independent Media Center, January, 2003<br /><br />Quoted by<br /><br />Nafeez Mossadeq Ahmed<br /><br />BEHIND THE WAR ON TERROR<br /><br />In Part Two, Chapter Seven: \\"False Pretexts\\"<br /><br />Woodward gives an insider's look at the seemingly intimate struggles of the Bush, Jr. Administration over Iraq. But as he is definitively a political insider now, with clout to protect, Ahmed, an established outsider, forces us to question the very relevancy and legitimacy of Woodward's entire perspective in a way with which he could never be comfortable. Woodward essentially gives us investigative journalism-lite*.  Ahmed gives us straight, no chaser, investigative scholarship, like the old Woodward, the likes of which can only demand a paradigm shift in one's perception of modern government, regardless of how you choose to reinterpret his fact-finding when you put the book down. If you've ever wondered what the Catholic bishops must have felt when reading the work of Galileo for the first time, or the Protestant community of the 19th century reading the work of Darwin, or what the Newtonian physics scientific community felt seeing Einstein prove his point about relativity, unlike Woodward (now the Newton to Ahmed's Einstein), the scholarship of Nafeez Mossadeq Ahmed will let you know in perhaps the most politically frightening way possible.<br /><br />In the end, whether or not you choose to follow Ahmed to the end of his theories, you will be left with a totally new understanding of the raison d'etre of both modern history and modern war. If you didn't know that FDR knew the Japanese were going to attack Pearl Harbor because he set America up to be bombed in 1941, in order to get the isolationist-minded American populace to join World War Two--and how he did it--you will learn with Ahmed. If you didn't know that there were plans in the military (kept classified until the Freedom of Information Act of 1975) of terrorizing and even killing American citizens in Miami and throughout Florida in such a way that it would look like Castro's military did it, to justify an American invasion of Cuba in 1962, you will learn with Ahmed.  If you didn't know that the total absence of any military response to the hijacking of American planes before they hit the World Trade Center on September 11th is something that has NEVER happened before in FAA or military history, you will learn with Ahmed. If you had no idea of the unusual and otherwise inexplicably heavy trade on the stock market that took place days before September 11th regarding Airline and oil stocks, you will learn with Ahmed.<br /><br />And if you can find a way to digest all of that, plus<br /><br />1) hundreds of other provable historical/foreign policy facts of the European/American 20th Century from a plethora of credible sources--in and out of America--he brings to light, revealing a unified and unchanged philosophy of government and power,<br /><br />2) the political/economic agendas behind the secret psychological architecture of modern day war explained with amazing clarity,<br /><br />3) the revealing of our current Administration's relationship with International Oil cartels for the past three generations, and<br /><br />4) the seemingly infinite number of both otherwise inexplicable anamolies AND<br /><br />  examples of unprecedented ineptitude regarding both the intelligence community<br /><br />  and the military's failure to prevent 9/11 from happening,<br /><br />WITHOUT coming to the same conclusions Ahmed does...than God bless you.<br /><br />I cannot.<br /><br />Iraq is just a little bit bigger than Saddam Hussein.  And the refusal of the American media to reveal the nature of the global, humanitarian/genocidal scandals of this administration makes it a corrupt institution beyond salvaging. Woodward's PLAN OF ATTACK is essentially an apologia to the Bush II administration, the true investigative journalism he once iconically symbolized, and the modern \\"courtier\\" journalism (as Cornel West so politely called the new American whorehouse) that is now called the news, simultaneously.  As such, the divided loyalties inherent in the book's construction definitively obscure and cheapen the content's intrinsic relevance.<br /><br />WAR ON FREEDOM (which explains why exactly 9/11 happened, and how) and BEHIND THE WAR ON TERROR (which explains exactly why we really invaded Iraq years later) by Ahmed are the real books every American needs to read, in order to save our Nation's soul--the soul Woodward seems to have sold with PLAN OF ATTACK for the benefit of controlling his now tenuous reputation in journalistic history.<br /><br />Read all three books, and come to your own conclusions.e total absence of any military response to the hijacking of American planes before they hit the World Trade Center on September 11th is something that has NEVER happened before in FAA or military history, you will learn with Ahmed.

King<br />ON THE DOWN LOW:<br />A Journey Into the Lives<br />of \\"Straight\\" Black Men<br />Who Sleep with Men<br />From chapter 16: \\"No More Secrets\\"<br />Chapter 7: \\"The Black Church\\"<br />and the Introduction<br />(emphasis mine)<br /><br />I am a professional musician/singer and actor from New York who has had deep and abiding friendships with straight and gay men in and out of the business of the performing arts; men who have shared with me the most intimate and somewhat frightening aspects of their personal and sexual lives.  And I still have never read nor heard anything nearly as disturbing as the cultural revalation that is J.L. King's book ON THE DOWN LOW.  Bisexuality, the thing I never truly believed existed to the degree King makes clear does, is seemingly the new *gay* in American society, regarding perception: it is the third, undiscovered \\"gender\\" making the now other two--not women and men but heterosexuals and homosexuals--not just seem like the non-perverse antithesis.  It makes both homosexuality and heterosexuality worthy of having THEIR very existence as a non-changeable, static entity being questioned.<br /><br />J.L. King makes it clear that bisexual men, while obviously not straight, are still also not gay in the conventional sense. They have no interest in being a part of the QUEER AS FOLK/WILL & GRACE/San Francisco/New York culture of homosexuality as it has come to be known in the late 20th/early 21st century America.  Yet the very same-sex sexual desire that otherwise defines the phenomenon of being gay, despite their enjoyment of heterosexual sex, is, like the religious experience that defines a converted Christian (or the chemical addiction experience that defines an alcoholic), something that is seemingly too powerful in them to not secretly define them as individuals.  Combine this dynamic with institutionalized racism (both in AND around the Black community) and the inherently deceitful, will to pseudo-redemptive ignorance that is the hallmark of our narcissistic/Imperialist age (a cultural disease sheepily worshipped as if it were sacred in most of our Black churches)...and you have one of the top five killers of black women in America, via HIV and the AIDS virus: bisexual men who refuse to use condoms before gay sex, infecting their female lovers sometime afterwards.<br /><br />\\"A survey by the centers for disease control in Atlanta found that nearly a quarter of Black HIV positive men who had sex with men consider themselves to be heterosexual.\\"<br /><br />ESSENCE Magazine<br />As quoted by J.L. King in<br />ON THE DOWN LOW<br /><br />J.L. King is not a healthcare professional or a sociologist. But by the same token, Paul Robeson wasn't a communist; Martin Luther King wasn't a Mahatma Ghandi-esque, \\"Satyagraha\\" Hindu; and Oprah isn't a psychologist.  That is part of what makes this book such a national treasure in general, and the ultimate wake up call for Black America in particular.

J.L.

Hence our [military] interventions are necessarily righteous in intent, if occasionally clumsy in execution.... Unwittingly, no doubt, [political commentators and historians Max] Boot and [Walter] Kagan [who agree with this premise regarding American foreign policy and show it in their writings] are plagiarizing John Stuart Mill's classic essay on humanitarian intervention, in which he urged [19th Century] Britain to undertake the enterpise vigorously--SPECIFICALLY, TO CONQUER MORE OF INDIA.... Unmentioned was that by doing so, Britain was...extending the near monopoly of opium production that it needed both to force open Chinese markets by violence and to sustain the imperial system...by means of its immense narcotrafficking enterprises, all well known in England at the time...Such facts might inspire some reflection, as Boot and Kagan illustrate Marx's dictum about tragedy replayed as farce...<br /><br />\\"One may choose to have selective faith in the domestic political leadership, adopting the stance that Hans Morgenthau, one of the founders of modern international relations theory, condemned as 'our conformist subservience to those in power'--THE REGULAR STANCE OF MOST INTELLECTUALS THROUGHOUT HISTORY.  But it is important to recognize that PROFESSION OF NOBLE INTENT[by political and military leaders] IS PREDICTABLE AND THEREFORE CARRIES NO INFORMATION, even in the technical sense of the term.  Those who are seriously interested in understanding the world will adopt the same standards whether they are evaluating their own political and intellectual elites or those of official enemies.

Once you get past the small percentage of the American populace who even knows what \\"hegemony\\" means, I said, the fraction of the little overeducated subculture who could make sense of the esoteric dichotomy that is the book's title, and buy the book in that context, meant that, unlike Michael Moore's work, he'd be preaching to the choir instead of stirring up the congregation.  He told me that his wife agreed with me!  But now that his book has become a bestseller in paperback, I see I have thankfully been proven wrong.<br /><br />The true litmus test for a patriot, or lover of anything--person, place or thing--is their ability to be true to the defining essence of a thing *within* what they love more than the outer shell of the thing itself.  Even if it means going against the outer shell of the thing when it has lost its way.  When someone can love the compassionate human being within the alcoholic but not the alcoholism--and divorce them compassionately on those grounds; love the frightened child within the raging teenager but not the disrespect that often comes with the rage; love the spiritual beauty within an art form that has been diluted or bastardized by the marketplace--and cuss out the sell-out artist exemplifying both dynamics for not being true to us or his/her own soul; or love the true essence of a nation whose leaders are selling its soul more than the corrupted leaders and their propaganda themeslves...this is when a person enters the high spiritual dichotomy of \\"loving the sinner and hating the sin\\"--above and beyond the stale, modern Christian hypocrite's use of the phrase--in a way that is truly redemptive for all of humankind.<br /><br />It is in this way that Noam Chomsky, the Jeremiah of our American Century, has made his mark on world culture, for the good of us all.  He is a true patriot/prophet of the American REPUBLIC in a way that puts all other fake, pseudo-intellectual hypocrite imperialists and those secretly contemputous of actual democracy to shame.<br /><br />This being only the third of the more than seventy books he has written that I have finished, my first instinct is still to agree with the opinons of celebrated authors like Arundhati Roy, who believe this is the best introduction to the work, courage and window to truth and reason that is Noam Chomsky he has yet written.  In this book, you will find the actual definition of terrorism; the actual definition of democracy; the actual definition of totalitarianism; the actual definition of propaganda; the actual definition of virtually everything you thought the evening news was telling you.  And you will find, amidst the powerful, focused passion that is often the vehicle of his intellect, a cogent, rational, universally all-encompassing argument within an authentic historical perspective that can only be disagreed with or ignored in the name of the very evil forces America is supposed to be about the business of fighting against.<br /><br />Thank God for Dr. Noam Chomsky.  And God help us all if we don't start listening to him.  This book, on so many levels, is one of the best he has ever written.

While reading his chapter on the four dominant personality traits, in fact, I found myself in a rather ironic way.<br /><br />The hero is, of course, the central character/protagonist in this allegory. However, it was when I noticed an existential disagreement with the author's definition of a dissident--and how dissidents should be in essence dealt with in an organization--that I realized that my dominant personality trait is that of a Maverick. Ron Lebow (as his nom de plume character in the book Kip) describes the dissident as being \\"an integral part of almost every organization (page 90).\\" He then proceeds, however, to describe the aspects of the dissident's character and personality traits as being those that are essentially, and wholeheartedly, counterproductive to the growth and development of the organization. For him a dissident is more of, really, a codependent. While I don't know the actual etymology of the term, I do know that the word dissident comes out of the lexicon of politics, and has been historically tied to the intellectual structures of the revolutionary minded heroes that follow in their wake. Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson, et. al. were very much the dissidents of King George III's colonists; Gandhi's Satyagraha--philosophy of non-violent resistance--was perhaps the most dissident theology of the modern era, influencing America's great 20th century dissident Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. With that kind of company (to say nothing of what's his name from the New Testament [smile]), it is obvious to me that when Lebow is being uncomplimentary he is not actually referring to a dissident but to a set of personality traits that are reflective of someone who exists somewhere between the dissident and his (badly used metaphor, considering the times we live in) terrorist. I would call them the wanna-be dissidents.<br /><br />Like paparazzi or simple groupie narcissists are to actual movie stars, the disgruntled wanna-be dissidents, whose intuitions do pick up on the structural integrity failures of an organization but focus on it only in order to avoid looking at themselves, are always in the company of real dissidents. They use the dissident's unique set of insights, awareness and profound courage as a technique to cover up their own character failings that they'd rather not be confronted with. As far as the negative impact on an organization however-in terms of both morale and actual profits and structure, etc.-though the natural inclination would be to say the terrorist is the most destructive, with perhaps my definition of the wanna-be dissident coming next on the food chain, I would venture to say that the very philosophy of management that would cause superiors to quite easily mistake a wanna-be dissident for an actual dissident is by far more destructive than any individual. Because that philosophy and confused method of perspective is what would also cause a governing body to almost instantly confuse wanna-bes and actuals in ANY of the dominant personality traits carefully described. For example, the Hero (Jeckyll) can easily be confused with a Charlatan (Hyde), who may know how to look like a hero in an organization he has studied carefully for an undisclosed agenda. Indeed, the most repressive political regimes in the world have always been those whose governing bodies structure their security forces, propagandists and militaries to consistently go after what could otherwise be called wanna-be terrorists, as well as the actual terrorists, both away from and within their borders. Before you know it, more time and attention is given to the wanna be terrorists than the actual ones...and virtually anyone, even the hero and 9 to 5-er, can be labeled a wanna-be terrorist in the fearful climate that that produces...and usually is, while the pretender hero with charisma calls the shots. Hence, WWII Germany.<br /><br />When such a fearful environment is created regarding organizations that have lost their way by those in power, you can usually bet on a few things: that a) they don't want to hear anyone tell them about it or why (what Mavericks do very well), b) they want people to create miracles within a dysfunctional paradigm that all but prevents miracles from occurring (overworking and exhausting the Heroes) and c) they are already ready to blame all of the hard working underlings for their bad executive decisions when crises occurs (why most 9 to 5-ers get downsized). The Dissident perspective, when this atmosphere has rolled in like storm clouds before a hurricane and people start worshipping false \\"economy\\" gods, is really the only one worth listening to.<br /><br />The Dissident is the one in any organization who is fundamentally aware of the paradigm shift that has taken place for the worse in the organization, and also knows the one that needs to take place for its betterment--and how it should be implemented. And he/she usually figures this out sometimes as much as years before everyone else does. The true dissident, far from being an angry, jealous troublemaker, is the one who teaches the Maverick the new music; the music that he/she then plays for the hero to dance the new dance.<br /><br />The dissident is the patron saint, or spiritual barometer, of the Maverick. Where the Hero of an organization may be the Heroic environment's heart, the dissident is its soul.<br /><br />Ron LeBow perhaps purposely dropped the ball here, to create the Zen experience of figuring this out for yourself. Either way, HEROIC ENVIRONMENT as a whole is very refreshing and worth the half day it will take to read and soak in.

It is, within any field, 'a reconstruction of the field from new fundamentals'; a complete demolition of an old theoretical and conceptual structure and its replacement by a new one based on entirely different aims and premises.

I do not agree with the popular success literature that says self-esteem is primarily a matter of mind set, of attitude--that you can psych yourself into peace of mind. Peace of mind comes when your life is in harmony with true principles and values and in no other way...\\"<br /><br /> Steven Covey<br /> THE SEVEN HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE<br /> From Part Four: Renewal<br /><br /> There is so much knowledge, wisdom, strength, courage and compassion in this one book that it is almost unbelievable that it was written so incredibly well by one man. THE SEVEN HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE is on my list of the ten most important books of the late 20th/early 21st century.<br /><br /> The difference between much of what passes for \\"self-help\\" in our time and this great work begins, ironically, with Covey's detailed analysis of the changing tide in American culture, as can be seen in the changing tone of self help books in American history. Covey studied this on the Ph.D. level. He saw a clear shift from self-improvement books from the days of Benjamin Franklin through the end of the Second World War, teaching integrity and honor as a foundation, to the hidden post-police state/American imperialist messages of the books written during the Cold War, Civil Rights/Vietnam and Reagan eras of the following decades. Killing much of the far right conservative mythology about America losing its soul with the Dionysian Civil Rights/anti-war movements in the late sixties, Covey shows how this cultural shift away from integrity and toward power over integrity,  *within*  (and against) all facets of the foundation of American culture, began sometime around the beginning of the Korean War of the early fifties.  The message of self help/get rich books became, ca. 1950, that a certain look, combined with a focused state of mind and an emotionally manipulative use of language (philosophies that can be traced right to the dawning of the interrogation techniques of the CIA in the late 1940s) can have you build wealth and influence without having to really believe in anything, master any craft or discipline, or truly respect anyone. Covey, while never stepping on anyone's toes regarding spiritual/religious beliefs or business/political philosophies (like I often do), makes it clear that integrity and character are central to human existence.  Because achieving them--integrity and character--is achieving the skeleton key that unlocks both human potential and the human spirit; the spirit that every other self-help book eventually refers to.<br /><br />There is no way out, but through.<br /><br />Like many holistic/transpersonal psychologists of today and mystics/spiritualists in history--not to mention theologians of every stripe--Covey structures the human experience in SEVEN HABITS in terms of three essential levels of consciousness. But he does so in a way that makes all the nouns associated with consciousness verbs, to keep the concepts active in your mind and in your life while he is explaining them.  And he does so always in a social context, not just or purely in an individualistic one. DEPENDENCE, the first level of consciousness according to him, leads to INDEPENDENCE, the level our modern American culture teaches us to believe is the definition of freedom and the ultimate achievement for mankind. Covey, however, reveals that INDEPENDENCE is only the second of three levels of consciousness, revealing those who believe they have reached Nirvana by being simply independent of others to be stuck in a mental and spiritual adolescence. As such most independence Covey shows is actually an illusion; total dependence on invisible forces or people can hide behind its surface appearance. INTERDEPENDENCE, Covey says, is the highest level of true human maturity: the heart of socialism (my words, not his); the soul of strong families, marriages and moral businesses, and the essential meaning of the word \\"ecology\\" (and as such the very definition of nature). Covey reveals INTERDEPENDENCE to be not just a great idea that has been talked about at length by hundreds in just our time alone but the ultimate goal of man, as it is mankind's actual nature as a spiritual being, part of a whole greater than our selves.<br /><br />From this high vantage point, Covey describes the seven habits of people who have achieved that highest level of understanding in terms of the intellectual/spiritual/behavorial path that got them there.  And also how they have definitively shared it with the world such that it has been changed for the better; in the business world, the political realm, and every other walk of life and human endeavor. Also, as such, how these fundamental principles followed are what lead all people toward higher consciousness, social relevance, worldly success, fulfilling and enriching personal relationships, and inner peace.<br /><br />I am profoundly impressed by this man and his work.  It has already deeply affected my life. You deserve this.always in a social context, not just or purely in an individualistic one.

US	50366777	R2FRREY00TPVXA	0312421273	647099960	The Corrections: A Novel	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Low family...High art	Jonathan Franzen's finding of so much epic poetry in the most mundane and banal aspects of the 20th century American dysfunctional family would rank him among many fine writers of his generation.  It is, however, make no mistake,  his incredible skills as a writer and his compassion for the characters that transcends the arrogant voyeurism that could be considered the foundation of the very art form he has grown to master that puts him in Toni Morrison/Mishima/Steinbeck-land with this wonderfully heartbreaking book THE CORRECTIONS.<br />Franzen for me never actually defines what he means by the term that is the title of the book.  And that's where part of the magic is.  The theme of corrections; corrections of mistakes within lives that could be so easily be thought of as existential mistakes as a whole is a leit motif that continuously returns in the novel at the perfect times in the most unexpected, artistic and inventive ways, from the most mundane to the deepest of allegorical levels. Franzen throughout this novel does not judge his characters, as much as he reveals their faults in such detail and context that one's desire to judge them as much as sympathize with them is seduced to the point of making the putting down of his book nearly impossible.  By the same token Franzen does not make a judgement on Patriarchy, or capitalism, or, the concept of &quot;race&quot;, or the tragic farce that often is what we call modern marriage.  But in the weaving of his stories within stories, pasts within pasts, dreams within dreams, all centered around the final Christmas one aging mid-Western family plans to have with all their sisters, brothers, mothers, fathers and grandkids--and demons--he reveals underneath his judgements of globilization, the intolerance for pain of any kind in American society (shown through our love of both dysfunction and pain killers) and insular suburbanism the many facets to all of these grand topics and ideas.  He does so in a way that forces you to think about them; to feel them while you are thinking about them; to see your self and your own life in their context; all while never letting you forget that love does not conquer all...love is life itself.<br />Oprah's incredible taste in literature brought awareness of this book to me--though, like most of the things she recommends, I didn't read it until the hooplah about it died down.  You will find Jonathan Franzen's life and his family in virtually all of the characters, I'm sure--particularly the much beloved but ill-fated brother Chip (ill-fated in the way Jung describes fate as the life made from the denial of ones true passions).  You will see the history of America in the 20th century in the rapidly declining Patriarch of the novel, and his eldest son the depressed suburban financier in a marriage spinning out of control, and the father's growing soulless relationship with his wife of 48 years.  But above all, you will feel as if you have moved into the architecture of the human soul through his writing style; a style that has moments of shimmering transcendence the likes of which will make you refuse to believe these characters are not a family you've known all your life...or maybe even was raised by.<br />I will be looking for the rest of his works based onmy experience of him and this great novel.  I highly recommend it.u to think about them; to feel them while you are thinking about them; to see your self and your own life in their context; all while never letting you forget that love does not conquer all...love is life itself.<br />Oprah's incredible taste in literature brought awareness of this book to me--though, like most of the things she recommends, I didn't read it until the hooplah about it died down.

Fair enough; no scholar or even rational person above the age of six will argue that. Given this as an obvious reality, why is it, really, that there are no comparative linguistical studies of African languages throughout the rest of the continent and  Coptic, Demotic, or the most ancient Egyptian written in hieroglyphs? (The results of such will shock you; some Diop reveals to be as closely related to ancient Egyptian as Latin is to Italian.)

US	50366777	R2SDWAC1V1NM9O	1859845002	792004982	Freud and the Non-European	Books	4	13	26	N	N	Said on Freud: duet of Masters	Freud's life and work (as brilliantly and controversially detailed in THE ASSAULT ON TRUTH by Jeffrey Masson) is rife with problems the likes of which adds to both the kaleidoscopic complexities and the singular horrors of the 20th century unlike few in world history. But the two most powerful Pandora's boxes in Western Civilization could arguably be the ones he opened with two works: THE AETIOLOGY OF HYSTERIA (1896), which proved under no uncertain terms that virtually all adult neuroses is a product of child abuse, neglect and pedophilia (a proof he backpedaled from soon after writing due to political pressure in the psychiatric community) and MOSES AND MONOTHEISM.<br /><br />We can only wonder which of the two is a greater bombshell to Western Civilization--academic and cultural. Both are routinely ignored in the disciplines they impact virtually as if they have never been written.<br />With FREUD AND THE NON-EUROPEAN, the Master Edward Said does not reopen the can of worms Freud opened with his reminder that the foundation of Judaism is in ancient Egyptian monotheism (in polytheistic disguise), and as such ancient Egyptian culture. He reveals the fact that it has never been closed, as he goes down but one road of the book's unrefuted implications to courageously confront the possibilities of embracing it for the political future of the Semitic people of the Middle East--Israeli and Palestinian. If the Israeli and the Palestinian are one people after all, why exactly are the fighting? How does this color the meaning of an Israeli sate that excludes them? And what does it do to the soul of both sides in the process, when Cain is essentially fighting Abel, writ large?<br />MOSES AND MONOTHEISM only begins to upset the foundations of Western political thought here, as Said only hints at but does not go into deeply, away from his central thesis. The fact is, Freud, with this work, opened the floodgates that separate religious and cultural history from anthropology; Judaism/Jewish history from Egyptology; and traditional anthropology from its more heterodox twin and the heretical historians of science. There are innumerable volumes of work from unsung scientists and historians, linguists and anthropologists, proving Freud's thesis in a hundred different ways both more succinctly and more academically than he did, decades and centuries before he ever seriously thought of the social implications of the subject matter.  The 19th century Godfrey Higgins' ANACALYPSIS; Gerald Massey's ANCIENT EGYPT THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD and A BOOK OF THE BEGINNINGS; dozens of others in and out of the four hundred year old scientific/historical discipline known as Metrology.... These works flow not from Freud, but into the world for many, inronically, through him. They flow through the intellectual heart of Freud's Achilles-like dip into the true river of intellectual invulnerability on this topic into the work of the often maligned but essentially unrefuted C.A. Diop, like THE AFRICAN ORIGIN OF CIVILIZATION; the maverick genius anthropologist from London Chris Knight, author of the amazing BLOOD RELATIONS, MENSTRUATION AND THE ORIGINS OF CULTURE; and every unearthing of sacred texts and their actual implications and contextual significance, from E.A. Wallis Budge's translation of the misnamed Egyptian BOOK OF THE DEAD and the PYRAMID TEXTS (see DEVELOPMENT OF RELIGION AND THOUGHT IN ANCIENT EGYPT, James Henry Breasted).  Straight through to the NAG HAMMADI LIBRARY's refutation of the overwhelming majority of orthodox Christian tradition and historical perspective. Indeed, with the re-establishment of Ancient Egypt being essentially an African society in modern cultural thought (which is, lest we forget, in northeast Africa; not unlike the Ancient Sudan [with even older pyramids], the Dogon or ancient Ethiopia), the very concepts of *race* when referring to Semitic people becomes such a firestorm that politics as it currently exists in the region canonly inevitably be understood when taking it into PSYCHOLOGICAL if not socio-economic context.<br />The natives had been restless on the other side of the intellectual/cultural fence long before Freud acknowledged their existence. Freud simply made the avoidance of such such an issue of integrity for the modern Western intellectual that it cannot be ignored, without the selling of the Western soul.<br />Edward Said was never known for ignoring anything of substance in modern culture or intellectual life. And with friends like Noam Chomsky, who excoriates the hypocrisy of modern intelligentsia with reckless abandon before eating breakfast in the morning, he does not let you down here. Whether or not you hold on to preconceived notions about the current conflict in the Middle East among Palestinians, Israelis and the rest of the world, this book, and Freud's MOSES AND MONOTHEISM will wash away your rationalizations for doing so like moss on a dry rock on the beach hit by high tide. Said tells us unquestionably, as he had done all his life, that there are some things that must be discussed and debated, if language is to have any vaule at all, and our way of life is to make any sense. And he does so, as is his nature, with elegance, lucidity and unparalleled brilliance.  This is Said's intellectual Satyagraha; he is a Gandhi for our modern minds.nly inevitably be understood when taking it into PSYCHOLOGICAL if not socio-economic context. <br />The natives had been restless on the other side of the intellectual/cultural fence long before Freud acknowledged their existence.

The culture of the 20's and 30's reveals the seedy underbelly of virulent capitalism and its siamese twin relationship with fascism as it has always existed in America, with varying degrees of influence and power.  During this period today's adolescent fascist sentiments masquerading as Conservatism were incubated, hatched and allowed to fester like an open wound, until the cancer of empire/police state overtook the body politic of a still embryonic American democracy in 1947.<br />General Butler revealed an actual multi-level fascist plot within Wall Street and the military to essentially destroy democracy in the thirties.  Fascism's influence in politics and the economy is one of the principal reasons, it is revealed, why there was a shift from fighting the remnants of Hitler, Mussolini and Tojo to an arms race with Stalin and communism after WWII.  Indeed, the OSS (which later became the CIA) use of Nazi and Japanese mad scientists and their secret experimentation on Jews and American prisoners of war, *via secretly arranging their US citizenship after World War Two,* to fight an already debilitated communism getting in the way of American imperialism, is a dark side of American history that could only be told [let alone believed] in the context of this basic paradigm of American culture.  Too many people, General Butler clearly knows, get rich in every war for it not to be the principal motivation for its existence.<br />The Isolationist idealism of his seventy-oddpage pamphlet WAR IS A RACKET, which could come across as childishly naive at times, delusionally socialist at others, must be read with an understanding of this cultural context. The Isolationist argument in American history has never been truly respected in our modern imperialist times. Brigadier General Smedley Butler, however, had the courage to go against much of what was ingrained in him as a career military man in the Marines and courageously share the only logical reasons for the architecture of modern war and the horrors of modern life.  The truths he reveals form the actual basis of the early 20th century Isolationist argument-and reawaken us to its profound moral validity for our times.<br />The lessons this book has for our times, however, only begins there.

Brilliant	There is a tremendous amount of violence in this book; the kind of subversively funny violence that makes it a bridge from the violence of Bugs Bunny cartoons of the 1940s to Quentin Tarantino's PULP FICTION and KILL BILL today.  And that violence, profoundly enough, like its antecedents and descendents, is not in the plot; it's in the construction, deconstruction and delivery of each line in the novel as a whole.  It is that kind of violence that is subversive enough in how it is delivered, in terms of context and irony, that makes this book so important, and, ulitmately, hilarious.<br />Only someone as well associated with the barbaric hypocrisy of the bourgeousie in American society like the Master Gore Vidal could write a book that reveals it to such maddening detail with such incredible humor.  And yet, like an ADD child gone too long without his pills or a self-loathing genius comedian riffing while high on drugs, Vidal refuses to stop there.  He begins to contemptuously deconstruct the very art form that is the novel to rip from it the very selfsame pretensions of artistic superiority inherent in it via its destruction--as it has existed for mainly the middle to upper middle classes in the first place.  He makes his point that the novel is essentially dead, replaced with movies and the television hour drama as a vehicle for storytelling in the modern world; yet he does it while going off Hollywood television culture, in the context of his many stories.  He even goes off on the very self-conscious postmodernistic style of novel writing after Pynchon, while staying true to the character and story development of about six or seven different absurd plots that form the bedrock of this sick but oh so American town named Duluth.  Imagine a small, racist, politically corrupt town in the mid West with UFOs, Aztec terrorists who speak like Shakespearean heroes when their Spanish colloquialisms are translated, and people who, when they die, get reincarnated into characters on a television soap opera made about the town itself...and you have about HALF of what is going on in this incredibly silly and profoundly beautiful novel.<br />Gore Vidal is to Mark Twain what John Coltrane is to Charlie Parker.

At Clem's party I had been reminded of the promiscuous way in which American doctors circumcise males in childhood, a practice I highly disapprove of...it constitutes, in [an] advertiser's phrase, 'a rape of the penis'.  Until the forties, only the upper or educated classes were circumcised in America.  The REAL people were spared this humiliation.  But during the affluent postwar years the operation became standard procedure, making money for doctors as well as allowing the American mother to mutilate her son in order that he might never forget her early power over him...\\"<br />Gore Vidal<br />MYRA BRECKINRIDGE<br />If there was ever an issue that metaphorically encapsulates the Achilles heel of Western society, it turns out that this may be it, above all others. The title of this incredible, clearly thought out, brilliantly edited and masterfully written book may lead you to believe that it is all about a seemingly benign issue. Make no mistake: what this book is actually about are<br />1) the actual definition of the surgical practice and<br />2) the social, economic, sociological, psychological and anthropological forces that go into us seeing it as other than what it is.<br />Dr. Goldman effectively teaches in this book, from the anthropological perspectives of such luminaries as Ashley Montagu and Margaret Mead, that circumcision is a practice that is older than all recorded history and religions.  (The practice was actually regimented and ritualized by the Egyptian priests and pharohs, millenia before the advent of Judaism.) Yet the practice, in and out of a religious context, continues. Dr. Goldman shows us from the purely medical/health/surgical perspective (with an avalanche of evidence and corroborative opinions in the medical profession) that circumcision is a practice that has little to no medical health value, and was once actually called a cure for masturbation and cancer by last century's medical community. Yet the implausible and unscientific theories justifying its existence keep coming up, and the practice continues. Dr. Goldman shows us, amazingly, from an internationally sociological and cultural perspective, that the United States is the only industrialized nation in the modern world that has the overwhelming majority of its infant boys be subjected to the practice. Yet the practice continues. Dr. Goldman shows us, from an ethics in medicine perspective, that circumcision is a practice that, by virtue of the harm done to infant children physically and psychologically--with little to no up side beyond the money going to obstetricians and pediatricians for the procedure--completely rips to shreds any conception of the Hippocratic oath and turns the entire life of any doctor who performs them routinely into a profoundly dangerous lie.<br />Yet, the practice continues.<br />It is an old anthropologist's dictum that the most important thing to know about a culture is what it takes for granted. Dr. Ronald Goldman, with CIRCUMCISION, THE HIDDEN TRAUMA gives us not only the hidden, true anatomy of the surgical process, along with the actual complete and (heretofore to my knowledge in everyday America) unknown anatomy of the human male, but also the secret architecture of the social forces and weaknesses that make up the ritualised American denial of the inherently violent nature of its existence. Dr. Goldman shows in this both innovatively and exhaustively researched book that the entire surgical procedure of circumcision depends on the total invalidation of the soul of the infant male child and their personhood for its existence in medicine.

Edward Herman and Gary O'Sullivan have written a diagnosis of the ills of the modern world with this book THE TERRORISM INDUSTRY that becomes a moral issue of dangerous proportions for any rational person to ignore.  In this, they uncover the very definition of terrorism, and how that definition is used by the government and the media, is part of the reason why it continues to exist.<br />In THE TERRORISM INDUSTRY, you will discover that that which we call the terrorism that justifies the waging of foreign wars and the shredding of the Bill of Rights makes up little more than ten percent of the actual terrorism that has killed literally millions of (mostly non-White) people around the world.  And much of it has been supported by our government, for any number of reasons--making much of the terorism that is inflicted upon ordinary people in the Western world actually blind and frightened acts of revenge, though the American Media will never show it to be such.  Building on the analysis of bias and marketable propaganda that is at the core of the Media empires' definition of both news and history in the classic MANUFACTURING CONSENT with Noam Chomsky, Edward Herman develops exactly what his subtitle promises: a complete explication of the experts and institutions that shape our view of terror in the today's world.  Long before the avalanche of frightening alternative scholasrhip that is in their bibliography shows you the relationship of Nazism and the Far Right to the politics of definition of what \\"terrorism\\" actually is, it will be all but impossible to see the very way in which we are taught to perceive terror as a conintuation of the colonialist/imperialist policies designed to insure Western hegemony in the world, at the expense of the very democracy we (sometimes) defend at home.<br />Read this at your own risk.  But remember, living in the world as we know it in ignorance is a lot riskier.h news and history in the classic MANUFACTURING CONSENT with Noam Chomsky, Edward Herman develops exactly what his subtitle promises: a complete explication of the experts and institutions that shape our view of terror in the today's world.

Many accuse her of giving (White suburban) people a moralistic pill to swallow like LSD, inviting a return to a supposedly simpler, pre-Vietnam/Civil Rights Fantasia of American life. While this stereotype is not just definitively one-dimensional but even more simplistic than anything she has yet to write, it has, like every myth, a grain of truth to it that can be explained best via the work of the great psychologists of our time that she all but openly refuses to refer to. In attempting to avoid the intellectual and moral responsibility inherent in avoiding this necessary approach to sharing psychological truths, Dr. Ruth hides a professional insecurity, I believe, behind her common sense language that may reveal a not so healthy end-game agenda.<br /><br />Dr. Laura indeed gives a LOT of common sense talk in this, like in most of her books. The analogy of treating a husband like a houseplant or dog allows women to see through the manifestos they proclaim and strikes they go on; so often that they never stop and see that if the perfect man were given to them, they would have absolutely no idea what to do with him if they were never taught. She does not, however, go deep into the modern female psyche--like what Nancy Friday does with MY MOTHER MY SELF, or Judith Hollis with FAT AND FURIOUS, or Alice Miller in THOU SHALT NOT BE AWARE--for the benefit of *context*; to enable women to understand what unconscious agenda is being served by the behavior that is making them and their mates unhappy in their relationships. Her only concern in even cryptically stating the raison d'Etre of the entire discipline of psychology (which, people often forget, is not what she got her doctorate in) seems to be so it can give her an appearance of moral authority, enabling her to complain about the secular modern culture in the exact same way women complain about the men within it.<br />Here are facts that are not proclaimed in our common sense talk about male/female relationships: the overwhelming majority of angry women in marriages/relationships that they cannot stop complaining about in American society, regardless of variations of age, race, class, religion or social background, have virtually the same myths about their mother/daughter relationships and childhoods. Dysfunctional relationships via emotional narcissism are usually the product of what women learned or didn't learn as young girls in the mother/daughter relationship. And the norm for these relationships in America is often heartbreakingly deceitful and abusive. But the only way women can keep the myths alive about what this relationship was, and not be confronted with the painful reality of their actual pre-marriage life history, is by holding the man in their life responsible for changing something they in actuality do not want changed at all: a man/woman relationship that allows them to simultaneously confront and ignore the pain of their pasts, by being a living analogy of the primal mother/daughter relationship that has given them their self-image. In this context, the idea that women are always doing something noble by either waging war or playing Gandhi on their men is often an intellectual/emotional addiction--just like food, drugs or alcohol--and exists for the same purpose.<br />Dr. Laura, however, barely mentions any of this. She in the end holds as strong to the Men vs. Women pretense in HUSBANDS (in willful ignorance of reality) as her would-be readers with issues do in their lives--hence, the hidden attraction to her bull-in-the-china-shop style.<br />(Her actual personal history may tell you why.)<br />Naturally, people in denial of reality will get in line to call Dr. Laura any number of names for her proclaiming of the soberingeffect of living in it. There are also those, however, who can see not just the good in what she's saying but also the absence of good in how she's saying it. One may intuit, first, that there are too many unstated qualifications in HUSBANDS's guidelines.

Because of that alone, no man in his right mind would buy this book for his wife, secretly or otherwise; even if she follows Laura's advice to the letter, it will be used against him within six months!<br />Dr. Laura, routinely, does not honor basic truths about who women are in her work, despite honoring what women can (or even should) do. She in fact goes out of her way to ignore it, while lambasting her more liberal opponents in the Self-help section of the bookstore for doing the same. This truth-avoidance technique, armored with the arrogant masquerade of preaching common horse sense and the angry defense-mechanism sword of \\"we CHRISTIAN/they PAGAN\\" moralism, is the dysfunctional surrogate Mother dynamic generating her entire perspective--making her books the stuff of cultural politics, not psychology or spiritual health.  It looks like peace, but its really about war.<br />Dr. Laura's letter of the law in HUSBANDS is well written.

A woman's relationships with men, her own body, her mind and her self-esteem are usually the product of what women learned or didn't learn as young girls in the mother/daughter relationship-the first of any relevance for all women. The pattern for these relationships in America, whether women admit it or not, is often heartbreakingly deceitful, neglectful, anachronistic and abusive. But the only way women can keep the myths alive about what this relationship was, and not be confronted with the emotional/spiritual consequences of its painful reality, is by doing one or more of the following:<br />1) running to a religious community where these truths can be avoided with the use of scripture<br />2) hanging out almost exclusively with women who are in denial about the same problems<br />3) Willfully ignoring the fact that, as American women today, they are richer and more powerful than 90% of all women in the world and in human history (even at their financial and emotional WEAKEST) and the human responsibility that entails, or<br />4) holding the man (be it husband, father or abstract phallic symbol, like a \\"Patriarchal subculture\\" in the business world) in their life responsible for changing something they in actuality do not want changed at all: a man/woman or society/woman relationship that allows them to ignore the pain of their pasts by being a living analogy of the primal mother/daughter relationship as it really was.<br />Or 5): all of the above.

It is our view that, among their other functions, the media serve, and propagandize on behalf of, the powerful social interests that control and finance them.... In our view the...underlying power sources that own the media and fund them as advertisers, that serve as primary definers of the news, and that produce flak and proper thinking experts, also play a key role in fixing basic principles and the dominant ideologies. We believe that what journalists do, what they see as newsworthy, and what they take for granted...are...well explained by the incentives, pressures, and constraints incorporated into such a structural analysis.\\"<br /><br />Noam Chomsky (MIT)<br />and Edward Herman (Wharton Business School)<br />MANUFACTURING CONSENT<br />From the Introduction<br />\\"Those looking for a modern anti-hero could also find one here. On 13 September 1987 (French National Front Leader and racist anti-Semite Jean-Pierre) Le Pen appeared during an electoral campaign on an RTL radio show. Asked about Holocaust denial, he replied thus: '...I feel it's a detail in the history of World War Two...' The word 'detail' in French was ambiguous but LePen's voice made it clear in what sense it was used... His cynicism was accomplished--breathtakingly so. Over the years, it seemed that political rhetoric had ceased to reveal, or indeed to even conceal, ideas. Spin doctors had appeared to render political speech more accessible, but they had increased the blandness. If there was a crisis in contemporary politics its origins lay in the progressive decay of political speech, and the likelihood that henceforth politics might tell us nothing about ourselves or our destiny. Meanwhile a politician like LePen could, through his revolt against the rules of the game, depict himself as an honest man. You might not agree with him, he was saying, but you could at least acknowledge that he believed what he said. And yet LePen's real message was somewhat different. He was telling people that it didn't really matter. You could believe whatever you wanted to about gas chambers, just as you might feel free to entertain the thought that blacks were inferior or that the moon was made of green cheese. The truth was that nothing mattered very much.\\"<br />Nicholas Fraser<br />THE VOICE OF MODERN HATRED<br />From Chapter Six, \\"To the Front and Back\\"<br />I would give this book five stars for Fraser's writing style and the plethora of authors--both literary and journalistic/historical--he quotes and refers to from the European tradition.  His rendering of the European racist/anti-Semitic Id, underneath its cosmopolitan/democratic Superego, makes the revealing of its tortured collective Ego-continuously wounded by the presence of unrepentant fascism in its small towns and cities-all the more profound. If only such skills  were enough to reveal truth to the world to the extent that it needs revealing.<br />As soon as Fraser quotes Noam Chomsky as a \\"leftist thinker\\" and linguist in one chapter, regarding his ironic support of the freedom of expression of racist demagogues in Europe, Fraser begins to remind me, ironically, of the Frasier on NBC-TV, who dispenses psychological insights to radio listeners while staying willfully oblivious to the truly fundamental issues that make his own life and that of others so often absurd. Is it possible that the well-read Fraser, despite the many books he quotes and the hundreds more he's obviously read, did NOT read FATEFUL TRIANGLE of Noam Chomsky (which puts a whole new spin on the political economy of Anti-Semitism)?  Or Chomsky and Edward Herman's MANUFACTURING CONSENT, the critical analysis of his discipline as practiced in the US (often with European complicity)? Or Edward Herman's THE TERRORIST INDUSTRY; orORIENTALISM of Edward Said...or FOR YOUR OWN GOOD of that Galileo of modern psychology Alice Miller (with its psychological analysis of the German family structure that could only have produced not just Hitler but the otherwise inexplicable support of him by much of pre-World War Two Europe)?  Or Nafeez Mossadeq Ahmed's THE WAR ON FREEDOM?  Or even THE BEST DEMOCRACY MONEY CAN BUY by his brother-in-investigative journalism, the expatriate American Britisher Greg Palast? Has he nothing specific to say about the European slave trade of the 15th through 19th centuries (he never quotes cutting-edge history books like SLAVERY AND CAPITALISM, only the more psychological Zola-esque novels like GERMINAL)?  The ghost of Madrid and the Spanish Empire?  The advent of the oil industry in the 19th century?  Or the nightmare of World War *One*?  What does he believe is the specific, psycho-architectural legacy all of the above has left on the European view of Africans, Caribbeans, Hispanics and Arabs today, if any? Fraser seemingly still wants to pretend that fascism is a plague like Ye Olde bubonic, i.e., essentially cured, as opposed to accepting it as the cancer that has long since been out of remission and is quietly eating up all of our democratic institutions as we speak.  This is the message of the very thinkers like Chomsky he mentions more than once-without, conspicuously, ever mentioning any of his books.<br />Fraser's analysis of the destructive power of cynicism in general and the postmodern weaknesses of the far right in Europe in particular is both intellectually strong and deeply personal.  But in America, this concept is old; everyone knows it wasn't the Ku Klux Klan that Martin Luther King or Malcolm X was afraid of, and the KKK weren't responsible for either of their assassinations.  Knowing what Fraser has purposely left out of his reflections, it leads me to wonder who in the end is more dangerous: the essentially politically impotent man of evil with dangerous ideas, or the intellectual good person who has inadvertently taught us how to do nothing in the face of TRUE evil, until it stands ready to overtake us all?<br />A good book-but only when read in the proper context.LISM of Edward Said...or FOR YOUR OWN GOOD of that Galileo of modern psychology Alice Miller (with its psychological analysis of the German family structure that could only have produced not just Hitler but the otherwise inexplicable support of him by much of pre-World War Two Europe)?

I had no idea that this book has already caught on like wildfire around the country when she passed it on to me.<br />Jesus distilled his philosophy of life down to the Golden rule: do onto others as you would have them do unto you.  So how can we, Christian or non-Christian, devout or Practicing, Protestant or Catholic, completely fault any writer that endeavors to be as simple and life-altering as this? The answer is &quot;easily&quot;, because there are a lot of people who had bad writing and ugly agendas behind religion.  At no time however have I yet to feel that Rick Warren is one of those.<br />Should this book be read and adhered to with a certain degree of maturity? Yes; just like everything made for adults.  One can easily choose to have a problem (as I did at times) with any number of the quotes in this book, or how they are interpreted.  But in the end, you will a hear a voice inside of you that says that finding things to quibble with about a specially made plan that allows you to develop meaning and purpose in your life far beyond your present preconceptions of yourself, is the equivalent of sending away a free personal trainer because you don't like his sweatshirt!<br />Any book that can inpsire me to let go of my arrogance and submit to the higher calling of my spirit is more than worth your time.  Was it completely successful?  I don't know--though that depends on what the writer's actual purpose was, as well as mine when I chose to read it, and how well I adhered to its directions.

Miller, this should be in every American home	\\"This book centers in what we call a \\"Propaganda Model\\", an analytical framework that attempts to explain the performance of the U.S. media in terms of the basic institutional structures and relationships within they operate. It is our view that, among their other functions, the media serve, and propagandize on behalf of, the powerful social interests that control and finance them.... In our view the...underlying power sources that own the media and fund them as advertisers, that serve as primary definers of the news, and that produce flak and proper thinking experts, also play a key role in fixing basic principles and the dominant ideologies. We believe that what journalists do, what they see as newsworthy, and what they take for granted...are...well explained by the incentives, pressures, and constraints incorporated into such a structural analysis.\\"<br />Noam Chomsky (MIT)<br />and Edward Herman (Wharton Business School)<br />MANUFACTURING CONSENT<br />From the Introduction<br />Next to the Bible, Joseph Campbell's THE POWER OF MYTH and FOR YOUR OWN GOOD, the seminal work of psychologist Alice Miller, every single American home should have this book. Perhaps to a greater extent than even much of the other work of Noam Chomsky, MANUFACTURING CONSENT reveals the irony of where a truly moral path leads in our world.  Meaning, the religious/moral paradigms of Christian Conservatism, embraced in the inner world of personal integrity and \\"family values\\" and followed to their obvious conclusion--our outer world structured by commerce and international politics--leads one invariably to finding GOD somewhere on the left of America's political center; far and away from the Limbaugh-isms on the radio. Anything less is either cancerous cynicism or delusional hypocrisy.<br />Or both.<br />\\"'Genocide' is an invidious word that officials apply readily to cases of victimization in enemy states, but rarely if ever to similar or worse cases of victimization by the United States itself or allied regimes. Thus, with Saddam Hussein and Iraq having been U.S. targets in the 1990s, whereas Turkey has been an ally and client and the United States its major arms supplier as IT engaged in its severe ethnic cleansing of Kurds during those years, we find...Turkey's treatment of its Kurds was in no way less murderous than Iraq's treatment of Iraqi Kurds, but for (U.S. Ambassador) Peter Galbraith, Turkey only 'represses,' while Iraq engages in 'genocide.'\\"<br />From the Introduction (emphasis mine)<br />This 2002 edition of the 1980s MANUFACTURING CONSENT has a new introduction written by the authors that includes some important words about the current Administration and foreign policy, as well the power of the Internet to affect the Media's status quo. But lest you think the bulk of this work is dated, trust me; their analysis has only become more accurate with the Clinton and Bush Administrations. The writers don't need to add specific revelations about, say, Enron, the true cause of 9/11 and the current secret war in Afghanistan to prove their point.<br />(For example, see their comparative analysis of the painfully ironic relationship of the U.S. government with the Latin-American terrorist states Guatemala and El Salvador [we supported them militarily] and its adversarial relationship with the actual [though politically inconvenient] democracy Nicaragua during the Reagan years. Then compare this provable reality to the Media's Orwellian, fun-house mirror images and writings, as Chomsky and Herman show them to be. It is chilling. Through more than dozens of easily documented but heretofore underanalysed examples, the writers show how the dominant U.S. press (New York Times, Washington Post, CBS News, etc.) so often becomes the propaganda tool of the U.S. government that only an analysis of this degree would help you to understand what must be its obvious actual function. This work, in fact, may be the only book that could prepare you or anyone well enough to read the revelations of investigative journalist Gary Webb in his book DARK ALLIANCE, the book that gives the full documented proof of the story that ironically ended his career in the 1990's: his discovery of the origins of America's Crack Cocaine era in \\"IranContra\\" and Reagan's CIA.)<br />What the book lacks can be seen as a product of its internationally political perspective. The raison d'etre of this book is indeed all but stated outright with its final chapters on Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam during and after the Vietnam War.  (One could painfully envision Thomas Mann writing a similarly structured expose of the German media during World War Two, ending with documented proof of the otherwise hidden \\"final solution\\" for the Jews.)  Through this they climactically prove, unquestionably, that the popular story of the Media's East-of-Eden break with Government & propaganda at this time in American history is, simply, a very useful myth.  However, while Rachel Carson, Ralph Nader and several other consumer advocates over the 20th Century are mentioned by them in this introduction, the kind of \\"muckraking\\" examples you'd expect in that context, regarding the purposely unreported crimes of big business (like those of the chemical, fast food and oil industries)--despite their adverse affects on human health and American culture--are almost conspicuously missing from this work.  I would suggest, as a companion book, INTO THE BUZZSAW by investigative journalist Christina Borjesson, with its powerful Introduction by Gore Vidal.<br />Just the same, I cannot imagine an honest critique of this book's contents that would not smack of a sincere desire (subconscious or otherwise) to be lied to, such that a primitive, cultish, cynically comfortable but inevitably destructive definition of American patriotism can have some illusion of moral validity. The opening chapters set you up so clearly and powerfully for their revealing of the U.S. supported holocaust of Indochina--again, displayed as final proof of their Propaganda Model's ubiquity--that you cannot help but walk away from this book with both an enlightened mind, and a broken heart.<br />Agree or disagree with this book's premise, after reading MANUFACTURING CONSENT you will not be able to read the newspaper or watch CNN with the same naivet&eacute; again.

(I'll refrain from commenting on our current administration.)<br />Has he not read Chomsky's AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS, which predates Johnson's not so revolutionary topic by a few decades, as he (Chomsky) explains--with solid journalistic/historical proof of the State-sanctioned mass murder of innocent Vietnamese civilians with chemical weapons during the war--how intellectuals can easily become propagandists for political mass atrocities?<br />Does he have anything to say about J. Edgar Hoover's cross-dressing hobby while running the FBI, and how that influenced his criminological philosophy--represented in his decision to authorize the obsessive illegal wiretapping of Martin Luther King's bedrooms? Or Nixon's reported spousal abuse and historically documented racist paranoia that influenced both his domestic and foreign policy?<br />Has he thumbed through THE CASE AGAINST KISSINGER by Christopher Hitchens, about our oft-celebrated foreign policy/diplomacy guru, whose books are required reading at most of the nations schools of government, with the intent at gaining a new perspective on his philosophy?<br />Regarding less recent history: how about the severe child-abuse that psychologist Alice Miller has proven shaped both the experiences and theology of our first Protestant Martin Luther?<br />Back to today: What are his thoughts on a certain \\"BOOK OF VIRTUE\\"-ous conservative blowing almost 8 million dollars in casinos due to a gambling problem, and how that might--oh, I dunno--*color* one's way of perceiving HIS definition of the term?<br />Regarding influential modern philosophers, like Marx: What does he think of (Conservative matron saint) Ayn Rand's deeply adulterous relationship with the young psychologist Nathaniel Branden more than fifteen years her junior (which is a matter of history Branden, author of THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SELF ESTEEM, has discussed in interviews many times), and what influence getting some Hedonistic young nookie on the regular might have had on her \\"[sex] Objectivist\\" philosophy?<br />Do we wanna go back to the \\"beginnings\\": Aristotle's view of the universe was proven wrong by Copernicus and Galileo. But, as historian of science Giorgio de Santillana showed in his mind-shattering book CRIME OF GALILEO, the flack Galileo had to put up with came not from the Catholic Church (as the myth clearly states ad nauseum), but from the covert character assassination policies of the European University professors of the time. They agreed more with Aristotle's actual politics (which inspired the squashing of all dissenting opinions and theories) than with his philosophical writings. They in turn convinced the necessary political adherents within the Papacy that Galileo's \\"theories\\", while doing essentially nothing to anyone's belief in Christ, would eventually ruin the balance of power maintained by the Church, if they were taken seriously.  (Neither Aristotle, the teacher of imperialist extraordinaire Alexander the Great, nor Plato, HIS teacher, truly believed in democracy being the be-all/end-all for humanity--or for even all of the residents of Athens and Sparta.)<br />In fact, Aristotle's belief in the need to *civilize* children through education, because they were naturally evil little \\"savage barbarians\\" in his mind, could in the end be considered to be the biggest default influence on Freud. Freud, sometime after reading Nietzsche and discovering the actual root causes of child/adult neuroses, decided to invent his \\"Oedipus/Electra Complex\\" myths to define them, instead of inspiring Viennese society to accept the obvious: the consequences of pedophilia. His retrograde Aristotlian analysis of the supposedly \\"barbaric\\" impulses of children (aka \\"Drive Theory\\") has been subsequently proven to be, ironically, the world's biggest obstacle to revealing the effects of physical, emotional and sexual child abuse on humanity since its invention.<br />And speaking of irony: has the irony of King George III's 18th century Tory intellectuals' view of the Founding Fathers, and its similarity to Johnson's view of some of the revolutionary leftist thinkers he is skewering in this badly disguised political rant, been lost on anyone?<br />Speaking of which, how about the life of Thomas Jefferson:<br />  -his long-term affair with his negro slave Sally Hemmings<br />  -the DNA proof of the illegitimate mulatto children he sired with her<br />  -his unadulterated, unapologetic support of slavery DESPITE all of that, *in the context of the first few lines of the Constitution he so gloriously penned*?<br />Any thoughts on how that hypocrisy has shaped our view of democracy and its morally correct relationship with capitalism over the past couple (Jim Crow) centuries?<br />But perhaps most importantly: what exactly does Johnson think of himself? Are we, as he is an obvious intellectual and not, say, a carpenter, like Jesus, to perceive him as the lone exception to this ten-thousand year old rule, and buy his book accordingly?<br />I sincerely doubt Johnson has the courage to defend this seriously immature approach to what the actual subject of this book is: eternal truths and the flawed human vehicles through which they are usually disseminated (and, how their vehicle's flaws effect how they should be embraced). Instead of writing THAT book, Johnson builds an intellectual Pandora's Box with his approach; refining a timeless, spiritual rumination into an already dated political diatribe.<br />And then he calls his publisher...and opens it.<br />No intellectual could seriously attempt to survive this approach to psychohistory with any self-respect as such...unless he believed his target audience would be 1) more concerned with its propagandistic political effect, and 2) too ignorant to consider its actual merit--or its perverse implications.

Or to reminisce visits to some of the others that come up, like Amsterdam, London and Edinburgh. But Welsh is a good enough writer that you don't have to.<br />I ironically didn't see the movie TRAINSPOTTING nor have I read the book the movie was based on, so I cannot comment about PORNO (the sequel)'s ability to stand up to its predecessor artistically.  But I can make a pretty stange comment about it.  The characters are woven with such interest, as are the seedy places in the fast moving cities in which they find themselves, that you'd think you wouldn't be able to put the book down.  Yet I have successfully put this book down many times, and after about almost four weeks I have yet to finish it.  I like it everytime I pick it back up, but I find a way to put it back down when life or some other book distracts me.  I cannot say that about other really good or even really bad books; books usually can make me do only one or the other (put it down and not pick it up again if its boring or badly written, or not be able to if it is the opposite).<br />I don't know if that tells you anything about the book itself, but I would suggest if you like Irvine Welsh's work--or if you just like Amsterdam, Edinburgh, London and wonder about the life in the seedy sides (since none of us are going to admit we've ever been there of course) to buy this and see if you can put it down.

This is a process whereby, with all due delay, the Agency first denies with passion, then concedes in profoundly muffled tones, charges leveled against it. Such charges have included the Agency's recruitment of Nazi scientists and SS officials; experiments on unwitting American citizens; efforts to assassinate Fidel Castro; alliances with opium lords in Burma, Thailand and Laos; an assassination program in Vietnam; complicity in the toppling of Salvador Allende in Chile; the arming of opium traffickers and religious fanatics in Afghanistan; the training of murderous police in Guatemala and El Salvador; and involvement in drugs-and-arms shuttles between Latin America and the US.... Charges are raised against the CIA. The Agency leaks its denials to favored journalists, who hasten to inform the public that after intense self-examination, the Agency has discovered that it has clean hands. Then, when the hubbub has died down, the Agency issues a report in which, after patient excavation the resolute reader discovers that, yes, the CIA did indeed do more or less exactly what it had been accused of.\\"<br /><br />Alexander Cockburn and<br />Jefferey St. Clair<br />WHITEOUT: THE CIA, DRUGS AND THE PRESS<br />From Chapter 15: \\"The Uncover-up\\"<br /><br />\\"In July 1995, San Jose Mercury-News reporter Gary Webb found the Big One--the blockbuster story every journalist secretly dreams about--without even looking for it. A simple phone call concerning an unexceptional pending drug trial turned into a massive conspiracy involving the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, L.A. and Bay Area crack cocaine dealers, and the Central Intelligence Agency. For several years during the 1980s, Webb discovered, Contra elements shuttled thousands of tons of cocaine into the United States, with the profits going toward the funding of Contra rebels attempting a counterrevolution in their Nicaraguan homeland. Even more chilling, Webb quickly realized, was that the massive drug-dealing operation had the implicit approval--and occasional outright support--of the CIA, the very organization entrusted to prevent illegal drugs from being brought into the United States...Within the pages of DARK ALLIANCE, Webb produces a massive amount of evidence that suggests that such a scenario did take place, and more disturbing evidence that the powers that be that allowed such an alliance are still determined to ruthlessly guard their secrets.\\"<br /><br />Amazon.com review<br />DARK ALLIANCE<br />by Gary Webb<br /><br />PIPE DREAM BLUES, by Clarence Lusane goes far beyond documenting the role of the CIA in the drug problem in the inner cities and--more and more everyday--the suburbs of America.  In much the same way great investigative journalism borders on the nobility of a sermon, Lusane surpasses both simple storytelling and chillingly accurate social criticism to create the kind of unavoidable paradigm shifts in one's thinking that can cause you to lose quite a bit of sleep, before reading the morning paper with an all-new critical eye.  Paradigm shifts about literally everything that could be associated with drugs in the United States grace the pages of this book, from the actual nature of both addictive and illegal drugs (guess what? the one's that aren't illegal are the most damaging to human health and the entire country); to the haunting spectre, frightening architecture and ever-useful weapon of racism; to the moral vaccuum created by our crime-ridden capital Washington, D.C. having no representation in the federal government (and the consequences of it that the entire country must deal with); to the inherent structure of capitalism, its present day/21st century connection to the moral cancer of slavery through the 17th to the 19th centuries--and the segregation of the 20th--and its effect on the human soul in its entirety.  Barely a stone of modern American cultureis left unturned in this book, which should be the bible of every mayor, police commissioner,  FBI agent and social activist in this country.<br /><br />This is a book that will make you wonder why the obvious truths of the non-existent American drug war are being ignored after they are revealed--and then instinctively realize why: invisible people are profiting from it.<br /><br />Lusane is an extraordinary journalist, proving again that investigative journalism is becoming a lost art--lost in the tidal wave of politics run by corporations, not nations.

In so doing he reveals the cult of the right-wing that is currently in power internationally, masquerading as fiscal/social conservatives, such that the entire field of economics is shown to be the new World Religions of our era, ushering in a neo-feudal age of worldwide subjugation.  Indeed, economic structures are now religions that either rise to the potential of man and community, thereby healing millions, or devolve to destructive cults benefiting only its leaders--as is currently being done in America, and around the world.<br />The sickness of the far-right and both their economic theories and practices are shown in ever-increasing technicolor.  Palast in fact shows us, with massive documented proof, that absolutely none of its theories of how the new globalized economy will benefit all of mankind have ever been proven correct.  Most in fact have been historically proven to be inherently destructive to all but the five percent of the controlling body who invented them. He simultaneously shows how all of the methods to bring them into fruition have been exposed to be deeply immoral. The right wing is seemingly out to prove, in a post-communist ironic fashion, that Marx was right in every conceivable way possible with a shameless vengence.

I knew all too well much of the subject matter, as it affected someone in my family as close to me as the fictional character's brother was to him. But when I finished reading this literally 900-page novel a week ago, all I could think was that its cental flaw was that IT WAS TOO SHORT.<br />Wally Lamb, a genius of a novelist, has written a momument to love, healing, self-awareness and the human spirit that has only been equalled, I can only guess, by some of the best work of the 20th century--including Joyce, Melville, Ralph Ellison, Toni Morrison and Hemingway. I cannot imagine anything ever written short of the world's religious texts surpassing this. The central story is of a man named Thomas Birdsey and his struggle to answer with honor the Biblical question Cain asked God, \\"Am I my brother's keeper?,\\" by taking care of his schizophrenic twin, and his own struggle against the dying of the light of his own sanity in the process.  Lamb manages to teach more lessons about the nature of life, family, power, abuse, pain, wounds, healing, forgiveness, spirit, love and epiphany through the flowering of Thomas' consciousness in this novel--not to mention the architectue of schizophrenia itself, and how it serves as the ideal albeit frightening metaphor for our entire Age--than any DOZEN self-help books, tear-jerker movies and trips to Church or the therapist that I could ever think of.  Lamb does not tear apart the the fabric of modern life or maliciously diagnose the diseases affecting it for the manipulative purpose of creating characters and a convincing storyline. He sings modern life. He creates a symphony with modern life. And in so doing he bears a human soul more true and more consistently than most real people are capable of bearing to the most intimate among us in a lifetime. The family and friends and even strangers in this novel became family and friends and meaningful people to me; so much so that after 900 pages I still didn't want the book to end, even when it did so nearly perfectly. In other words, Wally Lamb with I KNOW THIS MUCH IS TRUE places the novel, the entire art form that is the modern novel, back into its proper place as part of the healing art of mythic sorytelling, in a way that has to be read to be imagined or believed.<br />I sat with this book ready to embrace a fairly good story and fairly good writing. I found myself turning pages uncontrollably and wiping tears as several of the chapters ended and whole new chapters of a human life began.

Audette's theory of nutrition. He goes from chaos theory and fractal geometry to the African Savannah Hypothesis of our anthropological origins like a pro. But in the end, it is all to reinforce the very simple logic of his thesis.<br />The agricultural revolution in mankind, he explains, brought with it a revolution in both our eating patterns and concepts of nutrition as a species that our bodies have not had enough evolution time to catch up to--if it was ever meant to at all. The discovery and mastery of fire, and through which the art of cooking, is partly responsible for human culture in its entirety (if Margaret Mead and Claude Levi-Strauss have anything to say about it). However, the fire-as-technology paradigm that was born then became a Frankenstein to Paleolithic man when it comes to nutrition, according to Audette. Man began to cook not just the meat and the berries and nuts, but also beans/legumes...and grains...and potatoes...and corn...and rice...the building blocks of the agrarian civilization that is the foundation of ours.<br />The only problem with all of this is that these foods (beans, grains, etc.) unlike fruit, vegetables and even (to a lesser degree obviously) meat, are inedible raw. And that is the fundamental problem of our post-agrarian existence. Because these foods are inedible to us in their natural state, our bodies were not designed to properly digest them regardless of how they are prepared. And as far as dairy products are concerned, Audette reminds us (as God knows how many have said it before him) that humans are the only mammals on earth that not only drink milk long after our infancy but drink the milk of other animals when doing so. (The production of milk itself, as well as all other milk-based dairy products, is the penultimate step of modern civilization [via pasteurization and homogenation] of making the inedible, quasi-edible. It came after the advent of sugar and before we totally lost our minds with the fast- and junk food we eat in the late 20/early 21st century today, like potato chips cooked in \\"Olestra\\".)<br />Ray V. Audette cut all of these naturally inedible foods out of his diet--much of which being the staple foods of our modern diet--and went back to the diet of Paleolithic man: meat, fruit, vegetables, berries, nuts, juices, water. After doing so, he didn't decide to eat certain portions or count his calories, or even keep track of his exercise. He simply redifined the SEVERAL incurable diseases he was told he had by his doctors (diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis being just two of them, at the age of 33) according to his new anthro-nutrition paradigm as, simply enough, *the body's reaction to food poisoning*.<br />And all of his diseases, one after another, disappeared in a matter of weeks.<br />Moreso than his biographical information in this regard, it is, once again, the simplicity of his argument and the corresponding lucidity of his approach that is irresistible. Even if you wish to argue the quasi-anthropological foundation of his theory (as both Judeo-Christian Creationists and post-African Savannah theory anthropologists would find it impossible not to), he backs it up with so much science that, after the Atkins diet and others stop ringing in your ears, you'll want to try it on.<br />NEANDERTHIN may seem like yet another nonsensical, not-for-real diet book for profit, but it is a masterful contribution to modern health.e production of milk itself, as well as all other milk-based dairy products, is the penultimate step of modern civilization [via pasteurization and homogenation] of making the inedible, quasi-edible.

But they are so prevalent and distracting anyone wanting to read the book should be prepared for them:<br />=the endless amount of typos<br />=the poor choice of typesetting and fonts and haphazard uses of bold print, italics and quotation marks to make important points<br />=the total absence of a bibliography and/or proper footnotes at the end or in any of the chapters<br />=the quick references to the historically documented existence of his perspective on the healing properties of coral calcium that come and go without documentation to back it up (Mr. Barefoot tells us a few times that Europe owes its discovery to the 16th century Spanish explorers who brought it home and sold it from Okinawa, Japan, but quotes none of the explorers or doctors of old Spain that commented on it)<br />=the structure of the book that makes much of the scientific data supplied to prove his thesis nearly overwhelming and terribly confusing at times to the layman (Mr. Robert Barefoot is supposedly a world renowned chemist)...<br />How I would love to have been one of his co-writers or his editor for this project--or seen to it that he hired someone to serve this role. These distracting issues are all of the things, that, like the effect of seeing the angel Gabriel descend through the heavens in pair of torn jeans, old Nikes, a backward cap on and a dirty T-shirt with a SMITH/BARNEY logo (while speaking his Godly message with a suburban accent instead of playing his horn) inevitably get in the way of the profound message they have for us. The unprofessional, thrown-together-by-high-school-students impression it gives you may even lead you to think, if only for a second, that the current medical establishment just might have had something when they supposedly took away Dr. Reich (the co-writer)'s medical license and ignored the two of these guys as if they were quacks.  Combined with the structural issues of the book, i.e. the chapter set-up, they make the writers look like the guy with the \\"REPENT, THE END IS NEAR\\" picket signs you see in the train stations of New York City in the old movies, instead of the paradigm-shifting Galileos of modern medicine with a profound message to share that they probably are.<br />Make no mistake, however: this is still easily a SIX-star rated book. I would give maybe two stars at best to any other book with all these problems of unprofessional structure and form that distract one from, what is in this case, the amazing power of its content.<br />If you find yourself attracted to the idea that there is a mineral that could not only be a building block of health, but, as a natural protector and healer of the body, a cure for nearly every major disease in existence--from diabetes to cancer--than this book is for you in a big way. If you are an educated person in medicine--a doctor, etc.--who is sick and tired of hearing about books advertising panaceas like this, believing none of them have a basis in scientific rigor...than this book is even MORE for you than anyone else! Barefoot and Reich, despite my critiques in the previous paragraphs, go through great pains to show much of the scientific, historical and anecdotal evidence of the validity of their theory, as well as the socio-economic and cultural/psychological reasons as to why it has not been embraced by the medical establishment, despite its lucidity and the degree to which it saves lives. They made a believer out of me by the time I got half way through it.<br />In THE CALCIUM FACTOR, Barefoot and Reich show how calcium, more than carbon or iron and maybe as much as oxygen, is the building block of life itself. Its role in creating an alkaline environment in our body chemistry as opposed to an acidic one is completely explained. And the role ofalkaline environments in our body chemistry and its ability to prevent both the onset and spread of diseases--the overwhelming majority of which can only exist in an acidic one (like all forms of cancer)--is also completely explained. But most importantly, they do manage to break it all down for people who don't speak *medicine-ese* such that the average person can see the multitude of benefits of putting more calcium in your diet, and the best way to do so. By the time you get to the pretty astounding testimonies from people who conquered otherwise incurable diseases and whose lives were saved by this new approach to health, you will already be ready to pick up some coral calcium at your health food store, like me.<br />This is an amazing book that is a gift to modern culture despite its issues of construction. I'm ready to use it myself to save lives in my famlily.alkaline environments in our body chemistry and its ability to prevent both the onset and spread of diseases--the overwhelming majority of which can only exist in an acidic one (like all forms of cancer)--is also completely explained.

This is a process whereby, with all due delay, the Agency first denies with passion, then concedes in profoundly muffled tones, charges leveled against it. Such charges have included the Agency's recruitment of Nazi scientists and SS officials; experiments on unwitting American citizens; efforts to assassinate Fidel Castro; alliances with opium lords in Burma, Thailand and Laos; an assassination program in Vietnam; complicity in the toppling of Salvador Allende in Chile; the arming of opium traffickers and religious fanatics in Afghanistan; the training of murderous police in Guatemala and El Salvador; and involvement in drugs-and-arms shuttles between Latin America and the US.... Charges are raised against the CIA. The Agency leaks its denials to favored journalists, who hasten to inform the public that after intense self-examination, the Agency has discovered that it has clean hands. Then, when the hubbub has died down, the Agency issues a report in which, after patient excavation the resolute reader discovers that, yes, the CIA did indeed do more or less exactly what it had been accused of.\\"<br />Alexander Cockburn and<br />Jefferey St. Clair<br />WHITEOUT: THE CIA, DRUGS AND THE PRESS<br />From Chapter 15: \\"The Uncover-up\\"<br />Two strange feelings came over me as I finished this book, which I could not put down when I picked it up until I spent an entire weekend devouring and digesting its contents until my eyes hurt. First was a complete and total numbing. No matter politically sophisticated or cynical you think you are, left, right or center, the contents of this book will kick you in the stomach repeatedly.  The next feeling that comes however, is similar to the feeling of spending time in a foreign country and beginning to learn the language by rote and exposure; hearing familiar words and sounds and piecing together their meaning and social context. Only it is even more subtle. It is like traveling to England or Scotland, and hearing people speak English, but not an English to which you are accustomed... realizing that a \\"fag\\" for them is a cigarette and a \\"shag\\" is anything but a carpet...knowing that some of the most familiar words and phrases mean something totally different to what you know them to mean.<br />After reading WHITEOUT: THE CIA, DRUGS AND THE PRESS you will have no choice but to listen to the rhetoric of politicians and the catch phrases that dominate the airwaves like \\"War on Drugs,\\" \\"War on Terrorism,\\" \\"Operation [fill in the blank] Freedom\\" and know that you are not just being lied to: A FAMILIAR SOUNDING BUT ENTIRELY DIFFERENT LANGUAGE IS BEING SPOKEN. Politicians and the CIA don't just simply tell lies. They SPEAK the LANGUAGE *lie*. And though it as a language sounds like English, without a book of definitions and catch phrases the likes of which you would buy for your trip through Italy or France (Which is what WHITEOUT becomes by the third chapter), this secret dialect of English that the CIA speaks would never reveal itself. \\"War on Drugs,\\" for example, is a catch phrase for social control, along socio-economic and racial lines...created by the most powerful drug dealers on earth. Nothing else.<br />\\"This is largely a story of criminal conduct, much of it by the Central Intelligence Agency. It is a story of how many in the US press have been complicit in covering the Agency's tracks. When compelled to concede the Agency's criminal activities such journalists often take refuge in the notion of 'rogue agents' or, as a last resort, of a 'rogue agency.' we do not accept this separation of the CIA's activities from the policies and directives of the US government. Whether it was Truman's meddling in China, which created the Burmese opium kings; or the Kennedy brothers' obsession with killing Fidel Castro; or Nixon's command for 'more assassinations' in Vietnam, the CIA has always beenthe obedient executor of the will of the US government, starting with the White House.\\"<br /><br />From the Preface<br />Chapter One of WHITEOUT sets the theme and tone of the entire book via describing the career assassination attempts on Gary Webb, an investigative journalist for the San Jose Mercury News who uncovered unavoidable proof of the CIA's involvement in the Nicaraguan Contra drug trade of the 80's.

Make no mistake, the present Republican spree on behalf of the corporate elite will sooner or later provoke a backlash...<br />...Indeed, it seems increasingly likely that the now moribund mainstream conservative movement of 1955-1992 will be viewed by historians as nothing more than the icebreaker for a resurgent radical right. Historians of the next century may well record that the conservatism of [William F.]Buckley, Kristol and Podheretz was an ephemeral offshoot from the main line of descent on the American right, a line that leads from [the anti-Semitic conspiracy theorist and radio priest of the 1930's] Father Coughlin through [1950's communist hunter] Joe McCarthy and [1960's racial segregationist] George Wallace to Pat Robertson and Patrick Buchanan. Though they claim to be students of the French and Russian revolutions, all too many of the thinkers and strategists of the conservative movement appear to have forgotten that those who begin revolutions are seldom the ones who finish them. Indeed, they are often among the first victims of the brutal forces they unleash upon the world.\\"<br />Michael Lind<br />UP FROM CONSERVATISM<br />From the Introduction<br />Only one who has read the modern psychological work of Alice Miller can imagine how Freud's heart must have broke years after writing THE AETIOLOGY OF HYSTERIA in 1896.  In this book, which Freudians still try to pretend he never wrote, he actually proved children are not sexually promiscuous by nature; they creatively express their suffering from forms of sexual abuse-usually experienced at the hands of adult guardians and parents-via cryptic fantasies. (He abandoned this work after extreme protest from pedophiliac colleagues in 1897 and invented the destructive Oedipal Conflict myth in its place; which has caused a century of psychological agony to millions of children and adults around the world.) Similarly, one can almost see \\"Zbig\\" crying the same kind of tears Freud must have cried after writing OUT OF CONTROL: the kind of tears cried when one realizes that, as with every Faustian contract, the devil is eventually coming to collect on the soul you sold him for power and success.<br />\\"Enlightenment,\\" the Buddha said, \\"is progressive disillusionment.\\" Ironically, the progressive disillusionment demanded by OUT OF CONTROL is a product of what it reveals in that context: Dr. Z's other books--and those who created public and foreign policy through them--are among the greatest contributors to the violent, materialistic and immoral side of our national character AND the virtually inevitable American Empire apocalypse he, with OUT OF CONTROL, so deftly details. The sacred iconoclasm of historian Gore Vidal, among others, gives us a new look at Truman, Stalin, World War II Japan, the Dulles Brothers and the Cold War in its entirety.  Zbig, in his historically erudite but sadly cryptic way, acknowledges this with OUT OF CONTROL via acknowledging what it all has produced.<br />But never does Dr. Brzezinski tell us the complete truth, historically or personally.  (For example, see Mossadeq Ahmed's THE WAR ON FREEDOM [where Brzezinski's THE GRAND CHESSBOARD is quoted voluminously] for his chronicling of both US involvement in the Islamic resistance to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and what it has produced today.  The CIA under Dr. Brzezinski during the Carter Administration, in order to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan, helped create \\"The Base\\": a collection of CIA-trained Islamic militants known in Arabic as *Al Qaeda*.  I'll let you guess who one of their Sau'di leaders was.)What, for example, can Dr. Z say to us regarding the discoveries of investigative journalist Gerard Colby, author of THY WILL BE DONE, THE CONQUEST OF THE AMAZON: NELSON ROCKEFELLER AND EVANGELISM IN THE AGE OF OIL:<br />\\"Nelson Rockefeller, who died in 1979, owned vast Latin American real estate and cattle ranching, mining, industrial and financial interests centered in Brazil...

It does not get old or outdated.<br />How easily this book could have drifted off into self-indulgent Freudian psychobabble, Fundamentalist moralism or New Age narcissism--all of which Alice Miller has warned us against--in the hands of a less gifted writer.  The fact that it doesn't at any time in 340-plus pages is nothing short of miraculous.  Polly Berends not only challenges one's view of parenting and loving, but also of Christianity and culture and the universe itself, by bringing mysticism back to the modern Christian mind while not alienating those of other (or no particular) faiths.  Filled with transcendent prose, quotes of everything from Buddhist sacred text to the New Testament to e.e. cumming poetry, and the writer's own heart (the heart of a proud mother and wife who walks with God), this is a truly beautiful work that made my mind scream what was important about my personal relationship with my son to me, above the distractions of my ego, with virtually every page.<br />Consider yourself the child, and this book will help you raise yourself.

Bush: The reincarnation of Pope Innocent?	\\"Islam, as we have seen, is no more violent than either Judaism or Christianity and indeed set a pattern of peaceful coexistence and conquest early in its history. What the Western scholars of the 12th century were doing was creating a fantasy that had very little to do with Islam, but which had a great deal to do with the problem of Christianity's violence...<br /><br />...The Muslim became the hated shadow-self of the Western Christian, hated therefore with an irrational and neurotic intensity.\\"<br /><br />Karen Armstrong<br />HOLY WAR<br />\\"1146-1148\\"<br /><br />\\"[Pope] Innocent now felt that there was no other solution to the problem but the sword, and on November 17, 1207, he wrote to King Philip Augustus urging him to take an army to fight the heretics in the region of Languedoc, offering him indulgences that were similar to those given to people who went on a Crusade to the Holy Land to fight the Muslims...<br /><br />\\"Innocent's dealings with the Catharists [a mystical sect of Christianity that grew to become Catholicism's greatest rival in the 13th century] had shown the hidden insecurity of the 13th century Church...<br /><br />\\"It is at this point that Innocent reminds us forcibly of modern leaders and statements denouncing 'terrorists' as inhuman monsters who are a peril to humanity and must be annihilated, but completely ignoring the part that they or their clients have played in producing the situation that made some people desperate enough to resort to terrorism...\\"<br /><br />HOLY WAR<br />\\"1199-1221: Crusades Against Christians<br />and a new Christian Peace\\"<br />(1991 Edition)<br /><br />Just when you thought virtually all of the ways of being in the modern world--psychological, cultural, economic and political--came bursting into consciousness like fireworks in either the technology of the 20th century or the nationalism of the 19th, Armstrong reveals that to be one of the biggest and most destructive myths of our time. In HOLY WAR, Karen Armstrong shows the paradoxically religious and inhumanly violent shadow psyche of the Western European world to be born not during the age of the Enlightenment or soon after, but in the bowels of Western culture that was the period of transformation from the Dark Ages to the Middle Ages--the tenth through the thirteenth century. Europe as we know Europe to be was born through hate, religious intolerance and murder as much as anything else.<br /><br />Armstrong's contention is that the Crusades of Europe, begun by Pope Urban in 1095 in order to unify the warring uncivilized factions of Western Europe with a war against Muslims to \\"liberate\\" Jerusalem, gave birth to this Western identity that exists to the present day--and with it Anti-Semitism, racism, religious intolerance, misogyny, romantic views of mass envy and willful ignorance regarding higher civilizations, and the worshipping of a military aristocracy as the foundation of culture.<br /><br />Armstrong proves her point beautifully, as one would expect of a former nun turned theologian and world class historian. But what makes her historical analysis so powerful is how she bridges the gulf between history and psychology such that HOLY WAR shows the hidden irrational impulses that influence and sometimes govern much of foreign policy in today's world.<br /><br />The parallels between Pope Innocent and President George Bush, Jr. are unavoidable, particularly as this book was first written before the Gulf War invasion, some twelve years before his presidency. Pope Innocent demanded a Crusade against other Christians--built on the pre-established paradigm meant for Muslims--for fear of his morally shaky Catholic empire being religiously de-legitimized by a more devout sect. His power and public appearance, dissipating as moral questions remained unanswered, became once again solidified through nations caught up in a deeply immoral but psychologically justified war against those now called unbelievers. The transformationof George Bush Jr. from inept leader for whom his competence and the very legitimacy of his presidency was in further question as the economy continued to go south in the first few months of his presidency, to post-Sept. 11 war hero against \\"(Islamic) Terrorism\\" (with a successful remilitarization of the American economy in the process) is too frighteningly similar to Pope Innocent's politics of Holy War to ignore--particularly considering how dissent within the country is not being tolerated in the streets or in the press. As such our Administration's motivations for the Iraqi war (as well as the pre-planned mounting tensions with Syria and Iran) come into new question, as does the logic of the portion of the country that supports it. Armstrong makes it obvious that our current Crusade against terrorism, obviously desperately needed for both the codependent American psyche and war-dependent Military Industrial Complex in light of the completed Crusade against Communism, is simply that: just another Crusade. Another Crusade in a nine hundred year history of waging war on the Middle East and others in order to refortify the Western sense of identity and political/economic power, underneath a new set of justifications. Perpetual war...for perpetual peace. This hidden shadow psyche of our culture, deeply lodged within the unconscious of both much of Europe and America, is what is being put to good use by the Oil conglomerates of today (of which Bush's entire cabinet is in bed with in one way or another), and coloring our perception of our entire world.<br /><br />Armstrong is a meticulous and scholarly writer whose mastery of the subject matter is almost overwhelming. At times, however, she reveals the inevitable biases of her British roots, despite her erudition leading her toward objectivity. I give the book four stars for this, instead of five. The four stars however are powerfully earned, considering how she pivots across the centuries from the Richard the Lionhearted to Ronald Reagan, to prove her transtemporal points about the consciousness of Holy War and its effect on the modern mind.<br /><br />An incredible book.leader for whom his competence and the very legitimacy of his presidency was in further question as the economy continued to go south in the first few months of his presidency, to post-Sept. 11 war hero against \\"(Islamic) Terrorism\\" (with a successful remilitarization of the American economy in the process) is too frighteningly similar to Pope Innocent's politics of Holy War to ignore--particularly considering how dissent within the country is not being tolerated in the streets or in the press.

According to this logic, the Allies could have pre-emptively attacked Germany [toward the beginning of World War Two], and perhaps saved millions of lives...Of course, THIS IS PRECISELY THE EXCUSE THAT GERMANY ALSO USED TO ATTACK POLAND AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES (emphasis mine)...<br />\\"... We can't give Iraq a clean bill of health, therefore we can't close the book on their weapons of mass destruction. But simultaneously we can't reasonably talk about Iraqi non-compliance as representing a de-facto retention of a prohibited capability worthy of war...\\"<br />Scott Ritter<br />WAR ON IRAQ<br />Facts ARE stubborn things.<br />Of the many stubborn facts Pitt and Rivers re-bring to light in this succinct and important mini-book are the following:<br />=Saddam Hussein was an ALLY of the United States during the Reagan Administration for reasons that make it clear that our invasion of Iraq could not possibly have anything to do with the establishment of democracy in the region. Iraq has a more than 60% Shi'ite Muslim population, corresponding to the more than 80% Shi'ite population of the presently hated Iran. A parliamentary, majority-rule democracy in Iraq would make both a Shi'ite alliance with neighboring Iran and a Muslim nationalist restructuring of the oil distribution of both countries a foregone conclusion. The price of gasoline would probably leap to *seven* dollars a gallon in the US instead of the rapid climb to two dollars we are currently experiencing over merely the threat of war, in the event of an Iraqi democracy being born and the subsequent Muslim Alliance domino effect spreading like wildfire across the Middle East; a domino effect which could easily become the first step in the (inevitable) reincarnation of the Ottoman Empire that Dr. Zbigniew K. Brzezinski warned the Pentagon against in THE GRAND CHESSBOARD.<br />The Reagan Administration, with a younger and even bolder Rumsfeld, allied itself with Saddam's secular (repeat, secular) and oppressive 17% Sunni Muslim regime specifically to prevent this. We not only looked the other way as he used the very chemical weapons we are going to war with him now about on the Iranian people (and his Kurdish enemies within the country), but, via the surplus of chemicals from US firms, *we helped supply him with them* to prevent this very post-Iraqi democracy Shi'ite alliance of Iran and Iraq from ever happening in 1982. It was only after the subsequent seven year war of Iraq with neighboring Iran where, with our help, Hussein began to save his regime FROM democracy while bankrupting the country, did he begin to look to an invasion of oil rich Kuwait in 1990. The only thing that could possibly be palatable in the eyes of American Foreign Policy, given these facts of political life, is not a democratic Iraq but an equally oppressive regime run by a castrated, easily controlled version of Saddam, completely reflecting the current set-up but in a newly democratic disguise.<br />And thousands of innocent people will die for this.<br />=Saddam, despite his dirty political motivations, nonetheless had a rational basis for believing that Kuwait was merely a province of Iraq and not its own in 1990. The British Empire, after it carved up the Middle East with the French right after World War I (totally disregarding the preexisting tribal, cultural and economic differences of the people in the entire region), carved off the most strategically important piece of its new colony Iraq and made it into Kuwait (to avoid Iraq from having any future control or influence in the Persian Gulf if it were ever to become independent) in 1921. Kuwait can be argued to be less of its own country and more of a giant symbol of New World Order Western Imperialism in the Middle East...which puts a whole new spin on why the Western world reacted the way it did to its invasion. Hussein's invasion of istherefore definitively and inextricably tied to the imperialism of the European/American West and its corresponding destabilization of both democracy and nationalism in the Middle East by the CIA and US Military Industrial Complex over the last seventy years. Hussein struck at the racial and socio-economic psyche of the West in a way that could seemingly best be compared to Hitler's invasion of Poland, but actually has a lot more in common with Nasser, Egypt and the Suez Canal.<br /><br />=Iraq's illegal weapons program has been so well dismantled since the end of the Gulf War via the inspections process that it would be all but impossible for our intelligence community to not see and surgically abort any attempt of restarting it YEARS before any weapons program he attempted to reconstruct--biological, chemical, or nuclear--could become even remotely functional. Sanctions and inspections, simply put, are working; maybe not as well as France wants to believe, but better than our administration actually wants, let alone wants to admit.<br />=Lest we forget: there are more than 250 billion barrels of oil under Iraqi soil. `Nuff said.<br />And perhaps most importantly:<br />=All of the comparisons of today's Baghdad to yesterday's Berlin for the benefit of making the war seem all the more justified is quietly forgetting the fact that, as this war will demand an American presence in the region for several years, *Baghdad could just as easily become the new Laos*. America can win the battle with Saddam's army in a matter of hours...AND LOSE A BITTER, ESCALATING GUERILLA WAR WITH THE ENTIRE ARAB WORLD A FEW YEARS LATER.<br />This book WAR ON IRAQ is small, overpriced, and seemingly one-sided, despite the not so ironic republicanism of Ritter complementing the expected left-leanings of Pitt.

However, they are worthy of urgent consideration, not only from members of the public, but by our purported political leaders and representatives...\\"<br />\\"...Huey Long once said, 'Fascism will come to America in the name of anti-fascism'. I'm afraid, based on my own long experience, that fascism will come to America in the name of national security.\\"<br />Nafeez Moseaddeq Ahmed, Preface<br />and quote from Jim Garrison, New Orleans<br />District Attorney, 1967, from the Conclusion<br />THE WAR ON FREEDOM<br />There are not words to describe the courage it will take anyone, conservative or liberal, left, right or center, to read this book from cover to cover and sit with the new world you will be looking at afterwards. Ahmed, through more than *six hundred* footnotes, political and historical analysis, quotes of everyone from European and Afghani political analysts to New York stockbrokers to American congressman and FBI agents--and some of the most erudite, plain language scholarship I have ever read--irrevocably changes one's view of history and current events such that one is left with the profoundly disturbing fact not by saying that his main theory is true, but by proving unqeustionably that it is POSSIBLE.<br />This is not an America-hating rant, the likes of which would make it the international antithesis (i.e. siamese twin) of much of the pro-American \\"literature\\" coming from the far right nowadays. This is scholarship the likes of which can only demand a paradigm shift in one's thinking, regardless of how you choose to reinterpret his fact-finding when you put the book down. If you've ever wondered what the Catholic bishops must have felt when reading the work of Galileo for the first time, or the Protestant community of the 19th century reading the work of Darwin, or what the Newtonian physics scientific community felt seeing Einstein prove his point about relativity, the scholarship of Ahmed will let you know in perhaps the most politically frightening way possible. Ahmed in fact, does not rely on the rogue scholars we are familiar with for the bulk of his work. He quotes BODY OF SECRETS: INSIDE THE NSA, the work of Gore Vidal like THE GOLDEN AGE, and 9-11 by Noam Chomsky as mere redundancies, adding to the mountain of evidence he has generated leading one to the inevitable conclusion that is the book's theme.<br />In the end, whether or not you choose to follow Ahmed to the end of his theories, you will be left with a totally new understanding of the secret architecture and raison d'etre of both modern history and modern war. If you didn't know that FDR knew the Japanese were going to attack Pearl Harbor because he set America up to be bombed in 1941 in order to get the isolationist minded American populace to join World War Two--and how he did it--you will learn it here. If you didn't know that there were plans in the military (kept classified until the Freedom of Information Act of 1975) of terrorizing and even killing American citizens in Miami and throughout Florida in such a way that it would look like Castro's military did it to justify an American invasion of Cuba in 1962, you will learn it here. If you didn't know that the total absence of military response to the hijacking of American planes before they hit the World Trade Center on Septemeber 11th is something that has NEVER happened before in FAA or military history, you will learn it here. If you had no idea of the unusual and otherwise inexplicably heavy trade on the stock market that took place days before Septemeber 11th regarding Airline and oil stocks, you will learn it here.<br />And if youcan find a way to digest all of that, plus<br />1) hundreds of other provable historical/foreign policy facts of the European/American 20th Century from a plethora of credible sources--in and out of America--he brings to light,<br />2) the political/economic agendas behind the secret psychological architecture of modern day war explained with amazing clarity,<br />3) the revealing of our current Administration's relationship with International Oil cartels for the past three generations, and<br />4) the seemingly infinite number of both otherwise inexplicable anamolies AND examples of unprecedented ineptitude regarding both the intelligence community and the military's failure to prevent 9/11 from happening, WITHOUT coming to the same conclusions the writer of this book does...than God bless you.<br />I cannot.<br />This is just a little bit bigger than a phony land deal in Arkansas and some oral sex in the Oval Office.

People have called him any number of names and epithets because of his inability to just accept things that don't make any sense in American politics, or avoid the truth no matter how disturbed it makes others, for decades. You would never guess from his detractors that he is one of the most erudite, prolific, brilliant, insightful and passionately patriotic authors of the 20th and 21st century. Vidal speaks at length in one part about the *Satan/Satan decaf* dichotomy that his critics have been trying to construct for him for decades, regarding a comfortingly inaccurate perspective on both Noam Chomsky (Satan) and him (decaf), such that he reveals the inherent hypocrisy in both their mutual critics' opinions and agendas.<br />Another part of DREAMING WAR (this part also threads through the narrative as a whole, as opposed to it being purely sectional) reads like a commercial/promotional for his historical novel THE GOLDEN AGE. He charts the psycho-political metamorphosis of America the Republic into America the Empire with the Truman years after World War Two, referring to his previously published work quite often. Critiques of him and this new book are inevitable because of this. Only hard core fans of his who have already read THE GOLDEN AGE, however, could be annoyed by this important context--psychological, historic, economic and political--in which he puts his critique/expose of the Bush/Cheney Administration, as well as that of his father Bush the First and, though not skipping Clinton entirely, Ronald Reagan's.<br />Every great artist and writer develops intellectual groupies, the undeclared members of which create love-critiques of their hero's latest work as a way of declaring their \\"in-crowd\\" status. Critiques of Vidal's work in the current political climate, given the controversial and deeply important nature of what he brings to light, always sound comical when coming form his more politically agenda-ed detractors. But the style-over-content centered critiques coming from those who have actually read his books sound more and more like the nerds at the STAR TREK conventions who can tell you the script inconsistencies of their favorite Kirk/Spock episode the more I hear them. Suffice it to say DREAMING WAR was not written for high school English teachers to assign to their students and talk about the poor sentence structure of chapter three before the bell. Vidal's work over the decades has gone from being a passionate love letter to America, to an objective diagnosis of its illnesses-to a sincere pleading for us to wake up and get out of the burning house that our leaders' imperialism has set on fire.  If any six or seven pages about the current Bush administration of the nearly two hundred that make up DREAMING WAR were to be proven accurate, then guess what America? we are long overdue for impeachment hearings. There are dead Americans in graves across New York City that shouldn't be there. Should Vidal really be crucified for making us ask this question: what kind of a country do we live in if Clinton can be crucified over a hoax about a land deal in Arkansas and a sexual affair, while the Media, Congress, the justice department and the American public would rather shut their eyes to the allegations in this book (and others!) and open them only to the television slaughtering of Afghani and Iraqi civilians? And if Vidal should be crucified for asking such a question, do we really still live in a democracy?<br />Gore Vidal's greatest gift to America is his returning sanity and thinking to our quasi-Orwellian culture by reintroducing three ideas to our minds we'd rather not consider: 1) that maybe common sense is another word for the mental programming of the masses, 2) that the term \\"Just War\\" has been proven by modern history to be, more often than anything, an oxymoron, and 3) that one's patriotism can often best be measured by the degree to which you question the character, motivations and actual agendas of your leaders.<br />Look on Amazon.co.uk (Britain) at the \\"alternate\\" cover of this paperback, to see how the rest of the world currently perceives us.<br />The only thing better than Vidal's books, particularly this one, is living an authentic life itself.y and thinking to our quasi-Orwellian culture by reintroducing three ideas to our minds we'd rather not consider: 1) that maybe common sense is another word for the mental programming of the masses, 2) that the term \\"Just War\\" has been proven by modern history to be, more often than anything, an oxymoron, and 3) that one's patriotism can often best be measured by the degree to which you question the character, motivations and actual agendas of your leaders.<br />Look on Amazon.co.uk (Britain) at the \\"alternate\\" cover of this paperback, to see how the rest of the world currently perceives us. <br />The only thing better than Vidal's books, particularly this one, is living an authentic life itself.	2003-02-20

Once, it is said, there was a time when disorder and sin were nonexistent...children respected their elders; husbands and wives were faithful to each other...popular literature was highly intellecual, and tended to promote good character...<br />\\"...in recent years the intellectuals and publicists of the American Right, drawing on both Jefferson-Jackson populism and Marxism, have developed a unique synthesis of the Golden Age and devil myths. The Golden Age...ended in the 1960's, when long-haired campus radicals took over the culture...\\"<br />Michael Lind<br />UP FROM CONSERVATISM<br />\\"Let me control the myths of a nation and I care not who makes its laws.\\"<br />Mark Twain<br />Michael Savage's book, like the WWF, is another soap opera for men (and the Tom-boy women wanting to play too) with big opinions and hard attitudes. I heard a commercial for his radio show where he went off on what men really mean when they describe themselves to women for dates, like in the personals, and cracked up laughing for about ten minutes. He's got the knack for catching people's attention and saying what they want to hear, and he's riding the knack all the way to the bank!<br />I personlly don't enjoy these kinds of books, however, because they remind me too much of the German propaganda of the young Nazi movement when Hitler took over back in the thirties, echoed in the anti-Semitic demagoguery of our United States. I was shocked to find out, in large part thanks to the writings of Gore Vidal, that the US had no intention of getting involved in World War Two in 1940 until FDR secretly made Pearl Harbor possible to ensure we would a year later. He knew it was going to happened before it happened; he also knew that America would not be inspired to take part in the Second World War without it. This is a matter of history, not opinion. America had no real issues with the pre-Holocaust Hitler who invaded Poland, however, partly because of the prevailing attitudes on the street engineered by populist books and radio shows. It was common for them to be heavy laden with anti-Semitic, isolationist and racist rhetorical messages that said, since a) they are all screwed-up Europeans and b) Hitler's ideas aren't completely off the mark anyway [our Jim Crow laws attested to that belief], we shouldn't get involved. They were also proudly justified becaause they supported the passion of the hosts' efforts to--imagine this? [Holy deja vu Batman!]--*save American culture*.<br />I doubt Michael Savage truly believes in the inevitable conclusions one could gather from his ideologies: the support of an American police state dressed in conservatism. He is just a radio shock-jock having a good time. But as an entertainer, maybe it isn't his job to be aware of the Zeitgeist his bestselling book is riding. Maybe it is ours.<br />\\"Indeed, it seems increasingly likely that the now moribund mainstream conservative movement of 1955-1992 will be viewed by historians as nothing more than the icebreaker for a resurgent radical right.

Nor is it entirely the result of greed-based pricing. It is caused by a most primitive mistake in the basic premise in the science of physiology that is [the] foundation to all medical and scientific knowledge of the human body...<br /><br />\\"...the 'science of medicine' has expanded on a hopelessly erroneous paradigm. The very foundation of 'knowledge' on which medical practice of today is staking its credibility and license to practice is in error and ignorant of water metabolism disturbance as a possible cause of disease emergence in the human body.\\"<br />YOUR BODY'S MANY CRIES FOR WATER<br />by Fereydoon Batmanghelidj, M.D.<br />From Chapter One and Chapter Ten<br />\\"A new scientific truth is not usually presented in a way to convince its opponents. Rather, they die off, and a rising generation is familiarized with the truth from the start.\\"<br />Max Planck<br />(as quoted by Fereydoon Batmanghelidj, M.D.<br />in YOUR BODY'S MANY CRIES FOR WATER<br />Chapter Two: \\" The New Paradigm\\")<br /><br />The paradigm shift in medicine of Dr. Batmanghelidj [\\"Baht-mahn-geh-LEEJ\\"] as explained in YOUR BODY'S MANY CRIES FOR WATER is not political or politically minded. His proven theories are scientifically holistic in nature, in a world where science and information in the medical and pharmaceutical industries have become economically politicized to the point of being slowly but inevitably destructive--to individuals and society as a whole. The simple beauty of his perspective on the relationship of wellness, disease, water and nutrition flies in the face of accepted medical theory. As such it has been creating such a controversy that most accredited doctors across the country in the AMA (American Medical Association) and NIH (National Institute of Health), supported by the big pharmaceutical chains, have refused to comment on it for years. Most, that is, but not all, as he shows in the book.<br />Dr. Batmanghelidj's premise is simple common sense, amplified via the microphone of modern science. The human body, like the earth, is made up of almost 71% water. And as such *cellular dehydration*, i.e. the drying out and breakdown of the very cells which make up our body's organs and tissue, is the cause of most breakdowns of our immune systems--and, consequently, the overwhelming majority of the world's diseases.<br />The most deeply arresting and provocative part of the book however was his chapter on AIDS. Dr. Batmanghelidj holds strong in YOUR BODY'S MANY CRIES FOR WATER to the idea that \\"AIDS is not a viral disease but a metabolic disorder precipitated by an exaggerated way of life. IT CAN BE EQUALLY CAUSED BY SEVERE MALNUTRITION IN POORER AND FAMINE-STRICKEN SOCIETIES (emphasis mine).\\" His paradigm-shifting analysis in the chapter entitled \\"New Ideas on AIDS\\" wreaks havoc on the cherished origins theories of both the far right and the far left in America simultaneously. (He shows, with pure science, an explanation of both AIDS's origins and its rape of the African continent and the American gay community far more logical than a) the homosexual/negro morality plays of the fundamentalist right OR b) the secret CIA biological warfare testing turned Frankenstein theories of the conspiratorial left.) POVERTY, it seems, may be the true epidemic disease: it is the central cause of the dysfunctional behavior and nutritional patterns that contribute to the metabolic systems failure of AIDS victims' bodies throughout the world who, up till now, have been wrongly labeled as victims of an avoidable but incurable virus. (Could there be a better explanation as to how the mysterious new disease SARS originated in the poverty-stricken areas of China?) This is why the cure has yet to be found; *it has yet to be properly searched for*. This controversial idea reopens the debate of AIDS and behavior, but in such a way that it revalidates our decades-old lectures on sexual deviance and individual responsibility via making them metaphors of state sponsored political deviance and international economic responsibility--with science, not poetry or politics. And it cannot be invalidated and ignored for long, because it is simply an expression of the scientific/philosophical foundation of his metabolic/cellular approach to the relationship of dehydration and disease, which has already proven its validity. In fact, YOUR BODY'S MANY CRIES FOR WATER carefully documents, via the innumerable patient recovery examples and the praise he has garnered from doctors around the country, Dr. Batmanghelidj's treatment of everything from hypertension to asthma, back pain to muscular dystrophy, depression to obesity through this approach, and much more. I found what is probably the source of my eczema and overeating, my son's childhood asthma and my mother's high blood pressure and arthritis, all in the first chapter.<br />I would invite anyone interested in the topic to also read the work of anthropologist Elaine Morgan (SCARS OF EVOLUTION; DESCENT OF WOMAN). Also, the work of Michael Talbott: THE HOLOGRAPHIC UNIVERSE. The *Aquatic Ape Hypothesis* that is the foundation of Elaine Morgan's anthropological philosophy--and her ongoing 30 year battle to have it accepted by academia despite its lucidity--will go far in helping you understand the simple wisdom and beauty of YOUR BODY'S MANY CRIES FOR WATER's approach to health. THE HOLOGRAPHIC UNIVERSE by Michael Talbott will give you an even greater understanding, via plain language, of the 21st century post-quantum physics of the spiritual protege of both Einstein and Krishnamurti that was David Bohm (he knew them both personally) and his profoundly innovative neurologist friend Karl Pribram. Their discoveries can be said to serve as the scientific basis for Dr. Batmanghelidj's holistic, bio-chemical/cellular approach to good health: the science that bridges the chasm separating quantum mechanics, biology, consciousness and mysticism, leaping far beyond the (inaccurate) 18th century Newtonian physics and Malthusian political philosophy that still serve as the unconscious pillars of most of present day medical health theory.<br />YOUR BODY'S MANY CRIES FOR WATER is amazing.

Specifically on matters that cut to the quick of what it is to be human in our time: psychology, religious and cultural origins, and controversial views on politics. I can think of only four or five books out of the hundreds I have reviewed and read on ANY subject, that have made me as queasy and exhilarated simultaneously as Michael Lind's UP FROM CONSERVATISM.<br />\\"Economic inequality is another subject on which the right has been anything but straightfoward. For most of the past decade, politicans and journalists pretended either that the rise in inequality in the United States was a myth, or that it was only a temporary phenomenon. The magnitude of the problem, however, can no longer be denied...\\"<br />\\"If further proof is needed for my contention that much of today's conservative political theory is merely Marxism with the substitution of \\"bourgeois\\" for \\"proletariat\\" and \\"culture\\" for \\"class,\\" it can be found in [the] call for enlisting art and literature in the service of Republican conservatism, a program that is indistinguishable, except in its content, from the aesthetic orthodoxy of American [communist] communities during the 1920's and 1930's...the literary and artistic techniques used by communists and fascists alike would be adopted to disseminate conservative ideology...For the time being, it seems, Americans will have to be content with the work of conservative public policy intellectuals.\\"<br />Michael Lind, UP FROM CONSERVATISM<br />From Chapter Ten: \\"Soaking the Middle\\"<br />and Chapter Three: \\"The Triangular Trade: How the Conservative Movement Works\\"<br />Michael Lind's detailed analysis of the modern day conservative movement is frighteningly astute.  He says that the Conservative movement, dead from betraying its own doctrines for Machiavellian scheming, is built on the inevitable flight of the Catholic coalitions, the New Deal labor force of FDR and the Southern white Dixiecrats from the identity politics of the Democratic Left after the Civil Rights Movement.  He examines the movement's origins as its ideals became codified not with William F. Buckley's GOD AND MAN AT YALE, but with the elitist ideology and political practices of Communist hunter Joseph McCarthy (a close friend and trusted mentor of Buckley in his youth), the culture of the inherited-riches elite, and the Plantation economy mentality of the Confederate south.  The Jeckyll party of Lincoln has become the Hyde party of the present day.<br />\\"The resemblance between Marxism and the classical liberal economic utopianism of the American right is a family resemblance. Marxism and free-market fundamentalism are squabbling twins, the offspring of the Enlightenment's naive belief in inevitable progress....neoclassical economists serve as guardians of the orthodoxy, promising \\"scientific\\" approaches to economic progress...Today's American conservatives, however, have adopted free-market fundamentalism, in its crudest forms, as their political religion.\\"<br />From Chapter 10: \\"Soaking the Middle: The Conservative Class War Against Wage-earning Americans\\"<br />\\"American conservatism, then, is a countercommunism that replicates, down to rather precise details of organization and theory, the communism that it opposes...\\"<br />From Chapter Ten<br />Soaking the Middle: The Conservative Class War Against Wage-Earning Americans<br />What Alice Miller is to psychology, Michael Lind has become to American Politics. Gore Vidal's comparisons of him to both Voltaire and deToqueville are, astonishingly enough, understatements.<br />\\"The danger is not that conservative policies will succeed....The danger is that when the inevitable failure of conservative governance occurs, an angry populace will conclude that mainstream conservatism as well as liberalism has been discredited--and that the extremists of thepopulist and fundamentalist right will be well placed to take advantage of popular alienation and wrath....

Coltrane; Anthro's paradigm shifter riffs	\\"A very high proportion of thinking on these topics is androcentric (male centered) in the same way as pre-Copernican thinking was geocentric. It's just as hard for man to break the habit of thinking of himself as central to the species as it was to break the habit of thinking of himself as central to the universe...<br />\\"...I believe these are the 'circumstances special to the point of 'disbelief' which explain how an anthropoid began to turn into a hominid....Many features carelessly described as 'unique' in human beings are unique only in land mammals. For most of them, as we shall see, as soon as we begin to look at AQUATIC mammals, we shall find parallels galore.\\"<br />Elaine Morgan<br />THE DESCENT OF WOMAN<br />Perhaps the most enjoyable thing about Elaine Morgan's work is her  serene confidence in the theory she popularizes. If her entire raison d'Etre theory of the Aquatic Ape were disproven tomorrow, you san tell that she, unlike many whose theories are more based in the mythology of socio-political circular reasoning, would be okay with it.  You can tell she embraces the transcultural, translogical--transcendant--metaphor that is the Aquatic Ape Hypothesis; the definitve rightness and beauty of it in terms of a profound truth that it points to, above and beyond what it is.<br />Alice Miller, whom I call the Galileo of Psychoanalysis, writes from her perspective the way Coltrane played a Broadway show tune or Bird played the Blues. She is clearly enjoying her subject; clearly believeing in the healing power of her craft; clearly knowing an other-worldly relevance permeates each book and each elocuted idea within it... and each completed work of hers grows, like the halo over Christ in all the movies made referring to his ascension, with each riff calling to a pre-existing but perhaps uncreated world of the ultimate reality. Like what one of Bach's fugues does to our concept of music, you know these ideas are coming from a source redefining the subject or craft in which they have arrived. Elaine Morgan shares this gift with Alice Miller to such a degree that, like Miller, she redeems her scientific discpline by reinvigorating the quasi-sacred mission statement that gave it meaning: *construct the ultimate mirror of who we are*. In other words, like a great jazz musician or modern artist, she achieves the sacred paradox of both artistic innovators and great scientists: she gracefully bows to the traditions of her predecessors by intellectually leaping beyond them.<br />The very idea that a paradigm shift in thinking so fundamental could take place in anthropology is still hard to conceive for the general public, who nonetheless finds the watered down mythology of many fundamental anthropological theories often comical. Just the same, the paradigm shift from the Savannah Hypothesis of human evolution to the Aquatic Ape Hypothesis--mankind's most important stage of evolution taking place not by a willful choice to hunt in the dry hot sun, but by an uncontrollable eons-long immersion into the sea--is currently the only one in existence in anthropology that can change our concept of everything to do with being human.  Not even sociobiology can say this.  It as simply the most logical theory not only reveals the subconscious Judeo-Christian and patriarchal biases inherent in the science of 20th century anthropology with its placing of man-the-hunter over woman as the central paradigm, but allows for a shift away from \\"androcentric\\" thinking completely, allowing us to understand humankind tremendously better through the evolution of women and children on an uncontrollable, ever-evolving planet.<br />The fact that the theories of her heroes have been all but ignored for close to half a century regarding the Aquatic Ape Hypothesis you can tell gives her cause to celebrate them that much more. But in the end you can tell it is its overwhelming logic that obviously inspires her more than anything. She makes this so clear in herwriting style that her books become fun to read.<br />THE SCARS OF EVOLUTION explains many of the things about being human that simply shouldn't exist or do not make any sense regarding the anthropological theory of man evolving out of the hot, dry, hunting ground savannahs of central Africa. The revealing of the degree to which the Savannah hypothesis is modern mythology (by virtue of its often ignored and often defiantly supported scientific and intellectual inconsistencies) is the central mind blower which is enough to buy the book. She does however go further from there, and explains things as innocuous as acne and bad backs as being a clue to the actually unsolved mystery of our origins. Elaine Morgan does it with such confidence and grace in fact that she doesn't need to dress her book up with the kind of academia language that would make reading it impossible for the average person. She knows how to zero in on some key aspects of being human in such a way that they prove her thesis and structure her narrative in a way that is both entertaing and truly enlightening.<br />Morgan makes it virtually impossible not to believe in the Aquatic origins of the human animal--which gives a whole new meaning to the concept of the human spirit. But even to the degree the Aquatic Ape theory may still be considered open to question, she makes it so clear that truth is not static but growing, self evolving and tranformative that you become awakened to the continued hunt of something that has never been totally caught: self-knowledge.<br />THE SCARS OF EVOLUTION is a wonderful introduction to her work and thirty years of ideas, and those of her predecessors.writing style that her books become fun to read.<br />THE SCARS OF EVOLUTION explains many of the things about being human that simply shouldn't exist or do not make any sense regarding the anthropological theory of man evolving out of the hot, dry, hunting ground savannahs of central Africa.

I mean independent thinkers, who may be \\"conservative\\" or \\"liberal\\" or \\"libertarian\\" or \\"socialist\\" in terms of their basic principles, but who are free to draw their own conclusions without looking over their shoulders and fearing punishment for heterodoxy...\\" <br />\\"If further proof is needed for my contention that much of today's conservative political theory is merely Marxism with the substitution of \\"bourgeois\\" for \\"proletariat\\" and \\"culture\\" for \\"class,\\" it can be found in Joyce's call for enlisting art and literature in the service of Republican conservatism, a program that is indistinguishable, except in its content, from the aesthetic orthodoxy of American communities during the 1920's and 1930's...the literary and artistic techniques used by communists and fascists alike would be adopted to disseminate conservative ideology...For the time being, it seems, Americans will have to be content with the work of conservative public policy intellectuals.\\" <br />Michael Lind, UP FROM CONSERVATISM<BR>From Chapter 3: \\"The Triangular Trade: How the Conservative Movement Works\\" <br />Michael Lind's detailed analysis of the overall psyche and political agenda of the power brokers of the Conservative movement in modern America is beyond prescient, beyond clear--and beyond frightening. It's also beyond superlatives.<br />\\"The resemblance between Marxism and the classical liberal economic utopianism of the American right is a family resemblance. Marxism and free-market fundamentalism are squabbling twins, the offspring of the Enlightenment's naive belief in inevitable progress.... In the former communist countries, the high priests of economic dogma were the Marxist dialecticians; in the United States and Britain (though not in Japan or continental Europe), neoclassical economists serve as guardians of the orthodoxy, promising \\"scientific\\" approaches to economic progress...Today's American conservatives, however, have adopted free-market fundamentalism, in its crudest forms, as their political religion.\\" <br />Michael Lind, UP FROM CONSERVATISM<BR>From Chapter Ten: \\"Soaking the Middle: The Conservative Class War Against Wage-earning Americans\\" <br />\\"American conservatism, then, is a countercommunism that replicates, down to rather precise details of organization and theory, the communism that it opposes...\\" <br />Michael Lind, UP FROM CONSERVATISM<BR>Chapter Ten<BR>Soaking the Middle: The Conservative Class War Against Wage-Earning Americans <br />What Alice Miller is to psychology, Michael Lind has become to American Politics. <br />Michael Lind's UP FROM CONSERVATISM uncovers the intellectual nerve center and primitive philosophical foundation for much of the dialectical arguments about virtually anything in culture today on both sides of the political fence, from the validity of Afrocentrism to the very existence of privacy and independent thought in our increasingly technologically fascist modern society--and the consequences of their gradual disappearance. <br />\\"...Today, having hijacked the Republican Party, [the leaders of the Conservative Right have become] 'radicals', seeking, in alliance with multinational corporate elite, to dismantle the New Deal [of FDR] and to impose their peculiar \\"New South\\" vision of the United States as a low wage, low tax, low regulation economy in which economic segregation replaces formal legal segregation not merely in their native region but in the country as a whole.\\" <br />From Chapter Five: \\"Whistling Dixie\\" <br />This book is to the future of American politics and culture what Martin Luther's original Theses, nailed to the cathedral walls in the 17th century is to the history of Protestantism. <br />\\"The parallel between [anti-Semitic conspiracy theorist of the 1930's Father] Coughlin and [Pat] Robertson breaks down in one respect to be sure: Father Coughlin was soon silenced by the Catholic Church and politically disgraced. Robertson, after expressing almost indistinguishable views in almost identical language, continues to be defended by conservative intellectuals, including the leading Jewish conservatives... a leading conservative editor with whom I was...on cordial terms...replied: 'Of course [i.e. The Christian Coalition]'re mad, but we need their votes.'\\" <br />With all the irony of Shakespeare and the fright power of Stephen King, it reads like the perfect combination of a masterfully written textbook and a beautifully crafted novel. This is clear cut political and cultural analysis at its finest, with brilliant, erudite ideas expressed in the most common sense language. A truly important book.	2003-01-29

Vidal traces the dangerous link between Timothy Mcveigh and Osama bin Laden to moral anamolies in American foreign and domestic policy in much the same way one could trace the otherwise unrelated illnesses of heart disease and lung cancer to cigarette smoking. In so doing he demands us, whether or not we come to the same conclusions, to look at our own cultural selves and our country's leaders with new eyes:  the eyes of much of the rest of the world.<br />Vidal is often too postmodern for his own good.

Yet any psychologist worth their salt will tell you the many reasons why memory, in a person or culture, is often the first thing to be EXORCISED. It isn't always something that leaves willingly. Bob Woodward brings common sense psychology--memory--back into the discussion of what has happened to the presidency, and America's relationship to it, since the quasi-psychotic Nixon disgraced it in the early 1970's. He reveals this with SHADOW, not by calling out and judging the Nixonians from the perspective of opinion, but via showing and analysing actual history. The degree to which the entire concept and institution of the American Presidency has been almost irrevocably debilitated by Watergate is the subject of this book, and it cannot be ignored in our time after reading it. In revealing the new cynically invasive psychic architecture of American politics, built on the destroyed remnants of the trusted Tao of FDR, Truman, Eisenhower, LBJ and Kennedy, he offers a glimpse of what Watergate symbolized about Nixon's soul. And what that tortured soul has meant for American culture today, in the 21st century.<br />Doing this not only puts Monica Lewinsky into a less mythological perspective. It also puts all of the machinations that now go into politicking for your right to actually BE President long after you have been elected--Republican or Democrat--into a new, important, and ultimately saddening perspective. (The degree to which her very existence in the public mind is shown to be part of a desire of Clinton's powerful enemies to erase Nixon's legacy from the annals of history with the impeachment of a Democratic President is brilliant. That omen is ironically overshadowed, however, by the way he explains the uncontrollable political Frankenstein that was the Office of Independent Counsel. This evil genie, with its granted near absolute power, is what Clinton let out of the bottle; a bottle that, after Watergate, was thought never to be opened again. Without it, the reincarnation of the Salem witch trials with Kenneth Starr and the pornography of his reports would never have occurred.)<br />I happened to have picked up this book to read after reading Conason and Lyons' THE HUNTING OF THE PRESIDENT--something which truly must be read in tandem with this if one is to really understand the social forces that also took center stage in the Clinton drama, despite their desire to still remain hidden. As such I found the Clinton chapters of SHADOW a rehash of previously digested material. SHADOW nonetheless, with its detailed meticulous analyses of the weaknesses and foibles of Ford, Carter, Regan, Bush and Clinton, and how these weaknesses became debilitating through the sins of their Watergate predecessor Nixon, cuts to the quick of our social consciousness today.<br />It is so important, it seems, for the American public not to have a historical perspective on anything that happens in politics. As if the pretense that all of it has no precedence somehow makes it more real or important--or worse, justifies an often hypocritically manufactured moral outrage. (I'll never forget the rage Clinton-haters would express at the mere mentioning of Sally Hemmings [Thomas Jefferson's slave mistress], Judith Exner [one of Kennedy's mistresses] or the broken first marriages of Ronald Reagan and Newt Gingrich, seemingly defending their right to believe Bill and Monica had usheredin the seventh sign of the Book of Revelations with their original sin.) Woodward's SHADOW destroys any validity that way of thinking had, and redefines the desire to be willfully politically/historically ignorant (as if ignorance buys someone moral virtue) as anything but sane. The book has a way of revalidating the entire concept and discipline of psychology, and its ability to explain the source of today's events, as it gives new strength to the battle weary line of Santayana: \\"Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\\"<br />Anyone interested in a deeper perspective on the Clinton presidency, the presidency of both Bushes, and modern American culture would highly benefit from this powerful trinity: Michael Lind's UP FROM CONSERVATISM, Conason and Lyons' THE HUNTING OF THE PRESIDENT, and this book. Woodward's SHADOW is extraordinarily well written, tremendously informative, and, even with its inevitable biases both in favor of journalism as it is presently practiced (Consaon and Lyons are fortunately not so kind--particularly to the Washington Post) and against the possibility of a president after Nixon inspiring the kind of faith and hope that those like FDR and Kennedy did (though he is almost right, Conason, Lyons and Lind will explain clearly why it could have happened but would not be allowed in Clinton's case), Woodward's masterful writing and storytelling skills hide a multitude of sins.

The answer is they cannot--and they know it.  Therefore most conservative ideologues have done their best to change the subject from the economy to what they like to call 'the culture'...Both race-baiting and the [sexual] politics of family values are part of the same Republican culture war strategy of diverting the anger of the white working class from the owners and operators of the Republican party--the corporate and hereditary rich--and focusing wrath on unpopular minorites...\\"<br />\\"Supply-side economics, the myth of public school failure, and the illegitimacy-epidemic hoax are on the the tip of the iceberg.

Nevertheless conservatives were desperate to stop it, in order to deny the Democrats a political victory.  The cynical reasonsing of Republican strategists was spelled out by Irving Kristol's son William: 'It will revive the reputation of the party that spends and regulates, the Democrats, as the generous protector of middle-class interests...'\\"<br />Michael Lind<br />UP FROM CONSERVATISM<br />From Chapter Seven: Three Conservative Hoaxes and Chapter Six: Whistling Dixie<br /><br />\\"From the beginning, his enemies portrayed Clinton as unworthy to occupy the office of President of the United States.

It is also, by default, a psychological anatomy lesson on the banal ugliness of human nature as it has been exemplified and exposed via both Clinton's enemies and those who sought to profit from his distress and stress-induced foibles.  Politically, this book proves without question that an American Jihad by one party waged on another has taken precedence in American politics for virtually all of the late 20th century, over and above any concerns for the American public. Psychologically, it is practically a confirmation of the effect of child abuse on the body politic and the human soul.  The themes (among others) of envy, opportunism, the obsession with power and the power of deep-seated lonliness reverberate through the hidden stories of everyone of Clinton's enemies, from the \\"bimbo eruptions\\" of women paid to lie about affairs with Clinton in Little Rock, to the majorest of major players in Washington and every stop in between--including religious cults in Korea.  Most importantly however, THE HUNTING OF THE PRESIDENT is based in its majority on the legal documents and court proceedings that formed the basis of the cases against Clinton--much of which was never consistently reported in the major newspapers or CNN (for which the only logical reasons, though pretty frightening, are given by the award-winning journalist authors). For this alone, and by this alone, the book is an incredible experience.<br />\\"Clinton's lawyers walked Gennifer Flowers through a detailed accounting of every dollar she had banked as a result of going public about her alleged twelve-year affair with the president.

(The term itself comes from the ancient Greek poet and moral philosopher Hesiod...) Once, it is said, there was a time when disorder and sin were nonexistent...children respected their elders; husbands and wives were faithful to each other...popular literature was highly intellecual, and tended to promote good character...<br />\\"...in recent years the intellectuals and publicists of the American Right, drawing on both Jefferson-Jackson populism and Marxism, have developed a unique synthesis of the Golden Age and devil myths.

Gordon Liddy who find both his prose and history in American society something to be proud of will I'm sure enjoy this book, WHEN I WAS A KID... as much as those with an actual sense of history will find it uniquely mythological to say the least. The one thing that keeps coming to mind, however, in all his referencing of a world that was really so much less free for even a significant portion of white men than he would like to admit compared to today (let alone everyone else) is, ironically, Picasso.<br />Picasso, after all his travels, after all his many women, after becoming a child prodigy and then an art superstar and then one of the most powerful cultural forces of the 20th century, was photographed and interviewed often as frightened and angry in the final years of his life in the early 1970's. This was a couple of years before the Watergate Scandal, where Richard Nixon came closer to destroying American democracy than most people would like to admit today. Picasso looked that way because for a moment in time he somehow became old; not in the way that leads to beauty through wisdom, but the frightened and angry curmudgeon old that seems like a giant defense mechanism for an ancient broken heart. Regardless of how great and important his life was and how much of a contribution he became to look back on, Picasso's immense ego, still, simply, didn't want to die. Liddy's WHEN I WAS A KID seems to be so saturated with this primal fear of the self-absorbed--the legitimate fear that physical death is the end of everything and one's popular view of the self is going to die right along with the physical body--that I can't imagine it being anything but a sad book for even his fans soon after they put it down, regardless of how it makes them feel beforehand. Arguing the validity of his view of American culture and history as upheld in WHEN I WAS A KID in that context is pointless. Sadness and melancholy, the likes of which has little to nothing to do with the \\"politically correct\\" state of the USA, permeates this book with every attempt to reenergize an impotent myth of America's past that Globalization and the Information Society is killing a lot faster than the Civil Rights Movement, the Equal Rights Amendment or the fall of the Berlin wall had ever planned on.<br />I listen to the voice of G. Gordon Liddy occasionally on talk radio. (A friend of mine, a victim of child abuse, likes anything on talk radio that sounds threateningly authoritarian or anxiety-ladenly patriotic.) And I don't hear testosterone or conservatism or even Viagra... I hear a man fighting against coming to terms with the arc of human life. The deeply ambivalent, angry, and righteous triumphalism with which he feels so pressing a need to saturate his neo-Twainish world view with ironically becomes little more than a reminder of two facets of life that, as we must all some day face in our own way privately, would be painful for anyone to come to terms with publicly. The first is that history, not his politics or his fans or today's marketplace, will be in charge of who writes his epitaph. And two, with the writing of that epitaph, much of the funny ideas he holds dear about himself, projected on to the country he writes about, will dissipate like a puff of cigarette smoke over the Rockies. I do not agree with his politics, etc., but unlike a lot of mutually ridiculous conseravtive and liberal political mythology, WHEN I WAS A KID, a sort of TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE from the Dark Side, makes me too sad to get fired up about it.e in charge of who writes his epitaph.

In so doing she outlines, according to her training (and, though it remains unquestioned, her politics) the inherent methodological weaknesses, dubious literary origins and sociological biases of the perspective.<br />Consider, however, the implications of Lefkowitz purposely saying little to nothing about the evolution of her own discipline in NOT OUT OF AFRICA. Then consider the implications of this more honest approach to the discipline of anthropology and its evolution by Elaine Morgan within her book THE SCARS OF EVOLUTION: \\"Darwin had predicted that the birthplace of our species would be found in Africa, but for a long time there was a peculiar reluctance, even among Darwinians, to follow up that lead. [19th and early 20th Century anthropologists] were not comfortable with it; they were seeking the origins of the lords of creation, and that conjured up a specific image in their minds. We cannot afford to be patronizing about this. Even today, when an illustrator is asked to draw a progressive line of creatures beginning with an ape, growing steadily more erect and intelligent, and ending with a human being, you can be fairly certain that the human being at the end of the line will be male, adult, and white.\\" This candid report of the inherent biases apparent in the entirety of modern European/American scholarship cast a blanket of question marks over the ironically titled NOT OUT OF AFRICA, where Lefkowitz seems to be saying nothing but exclamation points of truth exist in it.<br />Note also these words, not from an Afrocentrist, but the ancient Metrologist and scientist Dr. Livio Stecchini, former Professor at MIT, in his book, THE HISTORY OF MEASURES, regarding the sharing of his work with Classical scholars in the 1940s: \\"...To be more exact I should say that the criticism [against his thesis on the measurement principles of ancient Greece and their derivation from the more ancient Egyptian and Assyrian civilizations] was epistemological: it was a matter of deciding whether the Greeks or any other human beings could have thought the way I described...In this field [metrology: the scientific study of ancient measures] ONE CAN RELY ON EVIDENCE MORE RELIABLE THAN THAT USUALLY AVAILABLE IN ANCIENT SCHOLARSHIP, and as a result there is substantial agreement among specialists about all essential points; BUT OTHER SCHOLARS REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM THE EVIDENCE BECAUSE THESE DO NOT SUIT THEIR WAY OF THINKING (emphasis mine).\\" The entire discipline of Metrology since that time has been totally ostracized from the University to avoid today's Classical scholarship--like Lefkowitz of NOT OUT OF AFRICA--from having to deal with its findings at all.<br />Taking the stated raison d'Etre of NOT OUT OF AFRICA into account (essentially that it is Lefkowitz' bulwark against neo-Nazi mythology in Black Postmodernists' clothing), note this from Dr. Stecchini: \\"The historian Luigi Salvatorelli (...the most outstanding chronicler and analyst of the Fascist phenomenon in Italy) has written that fascism was, first of all, a reaction by the class of parasitic job holders with academic degrees against the involvement of Italy in the stream of international capitalism...this 'humanistic petite bourgeoisie' was the product of a classical education emphasizing only the rhetorical skills, and saw itself threatened by the possible rise of true bourgeois elites with all sorts of technical skills...Salvatorelli...points out that in Italy, classical education of the rhetorical type, connected with an ancient history that emphasized the political side, gave 'an artificial interpretation of the ancient world'.... IT MUST BE NOTED THAT IT IS IN THIS CONTEXT THAT ANTI-SEMITIC LITERATURE MADE ITS FIRST APPEARANCE IN ITALY (emphasis mine).\\"From this Ms. Lefkowitz can find not Afrocentrism (projection?), but much of her beloved Classicism's roots.<br />There is a truism of all societies regarding groups who are fearing an oncoming economic, political and philosophical paradigm shift in their way of life: they will express that fear via projecting its causes onto the communities for whom acts of mindless violence and aggression against has been previously legitimized, and strike out accordingly. Racism is just one institutionalized expression of this dynamic. I cannot recommend NOT OUT OF AFRICA because this dynamic of focused violence in the name of paradigm shift-phobia is exactly the psychological and epistemological foundation upon which much of modern Classicism and the entirety of Lefkowitz' intellectual critique of Afrocentrism is built. Her well written, detailed arguments regarding the dubious quality of Chekh Anta Diop's work and the integrity of Herodotos in the end, given their foundation in this power-based paradigm of irrational fear, can only be of lasting value to those with the preexisting desire to unquestioningly believe her argument before it is even made. Many of the less educated reviewers singing her praises for merely attacking Black scholars and Black scholarship unapologetically--AND NO ONE ELSE (like the Zacharia Sitchin ancient astronaut school of cultural/religious origins to name but one example)--make this abundantly clear.<br />The rants of Lefkowitz are, thankfully, eventually silenced by the quiet wisdom of Kuhn, the genius linguist who coined the phrase \\"paradigm shift\\" (as quoted by Chris Knight, anthropologist author of BLOOD RELATIONS): \\"A SCIENTIFIC revolution, according to Kuhn, is not simply an addition to pre-existing knowledge.

Women can't see what men are doing...This is because all the Dreaming business came out of women--everything...In the beginning we had nothing...we took these things from women.'<br />\\"It is one of the severest indictments of 20th Century anti-evolutionist anthropology that its models have led ethnographers to dismiss such profound Aboriginal insights as scientifically valueless.\\"<br />Chris Knight, BLOOD RELATIONS<br />Chapter 13: \\"The Rainbow Snake\\"<br />This is a five star, paradigm-shifting treatise on human cultural origins if there ever was one. Chris Knight's rendering of the four plus million years of primate and proto-human history in BLOOD RELATIONS, right up to the latest 200,000 years that begin true humankind and human culture in central Africa and along the Nile, through to the psychic/motivational bedrock of our conflicted modern society, becomes more impressive, more inclusive--and more impregnable with every chapter and every turn of the page.<br />My test for the far-reaching influence and power of any theorist--particularly of the wannabe revolutionary kind--is three-fold. One, their theory must be completely plausible; i.e. not needing simple revolt from detractors and complimentary but poorly explained aspects of ITSELF to proclaim and rationalize its essential relevance. Two, they must have the ability to completely encapsulate the foundational principles, concepts and findings of the other historical and competitive theories within its discipline as an integral part of its own new perspective; showing their ideas to be the great quantum leap beyond our sense of reality and the all inclusive step toward truth. And third, perhaps most important of all, it has to excite me. There may be things my mind will not be specifically educated enough, multi-lingual enough or quick enough to pick up, but you cannot fool my heart.  All these three are BLOOD RELATIONS's great achievement and great contribution.<br />Chris Knight, the brilliant and controversial London anthropologist, does this all in BLOOD RELATIONS with such remarkable clarity and erudition, in fact, attempts to disagree with his findings becomes pointless. His unified field-theory of the prehistoric African woman's role in the formation of human culture is so incredibly well done, and so profoundly earth shattering in its implications, that I read the book twice to fully soak in all the sacred pre-verbal intuitions I have had that it reveals to be historical fact and obvious science.<br />So far the only complaint of BLOOD RELATIONS I could have is the only one possible: he seemingly focuses too muchon the Marxist avatar of revolutionary cultural ideas while using it as the lens via which the origins of culture could be best understood.  This at times seems to ironically minimize the revolutionary spirit of humankind that produced them. None less than the great Picasso was once quoted in saying \\"today's artists are tomorrow's politicians;\\" focusing more on the *artistic* power of the creative human spirit (my bias) may have put his new paradigm in an even more inclusive perspective.  Yet even there he establishes, to my knowledge, the first credible dialectic between the devolved, political diseases of 20th century Stalinism/Maoism and the philosophical/scientific postulates of the 19th century Marxism upon which their regimes were originally based. So powerfully, in fact, that the Marxist perspective he examines and explains driving his reevaluation of 20th century anthropology--and, in turn, our entire view of human culture--need not (and in his book does not) come with the kind of intellectual apologies that would otherwise signify an inherent lack of validity.<br />Chris Knight with BLOOD RELATIONS shows unquestionably that women, via sex and the rhythm of menstruation, nurtured the primal creative impulse of civilization and they essentially created human culture. And he shows it to be made up of communal solidarity against oppressors and oppressive situations (be it prehistoric animals or alpha males), symbol-driven creativity, and achieving a certain oneness with the rhythms of nature. This primal social movement that is the womb of human culture, told in every ancient culture's foundational myths, could naturally just as easily explain the birth of democracy and/or capitalism in the historical ages of feudalism as it does the advent of Marxism in the age of capitalism...and what is next for human kind.<br />This is another of the great books of our time whose far-reaching influence in modern culture has not even begun to be felt. One can only imagine what anthropological works throughout history that have been ignored because of intellectual biases will now be reexamined and redeemed through his paradigm shifting work. I would combine this with Barbara Ehrenreich's 1995 work BLOOD RITES, and the 19th Century Gerald Massey's ANCIENT EGYPT, THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD as an anthropological trinity of monumental, paradigm shifting proportions that will change your view of humankind-our true past, present and potential-forever.<br />BLOOD RELATIONS is beautiful.much on the Marxist avatar of revolutionary cultural ideas while using it as the lens via which the origins of culture could be best understood.  This at times seems to ironically minimize the revolutionary spirit of humankind that produced them.

So powerfully, in fact, that the Marxist perspective he examines and explains driving his reevaluation of 20th century anthropology--and, in turn, our entire view of human culture--need not (and in his book does not) come with the kind of intellectual apologies that would otherwise signify an inherent lack of validity. <br />Chris Knight with BLOOD RELATIONS shows unquestionably that women, via sex and the rhythm of menstruation, nurtured the primal creative impulse of civilization and they essentially created human culture. And he shows it to be made up of communal solidarity against oppressors and oppressive situations (be it prehistoric animals or alpha males), symbol-driven creativity, and achieving a certain oneness with the rhythms of nature. This primal social movement that is the womb of human culture, told in every ancient culture's foundational myths, could naturally just as easily explain the birth of democracy and/or capitalism in the historical ages of feudalism as it does the advent of Marxism in the age of capitalism...and what is next for human kind. <br />This is another of the great books of our time whose far-reaching influence in modern culture has not even begun to be felt. One can only imagine what anthropological works throughout history that have been ignored because of intellectual biases will now be reexamined and redeemed through his paradigm shifting work. I would combine this with Barbara Ehrenreich's 1995 work BLOOD RITES, and the 19th Century Gerald Massey's ANCIENT EGYPT, THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD as an anthropological trinity of monumental, paradigm shifting proportions that will change your view of humankind-our true past, present and potential-forever.<br />BLOOD RELATIONS is beautiful.	2002-10-19

The problem I seem to have with this book is not so much the contents but its overall structure and design, which reveals volumes about both its actual purpose and the value of its theme. This can be seen clearly via Lefkowitz' sub-strategy of focusing on the work of C.A. Diop, the highly influential Senegalese anthropologist. She seems to assume that by declaring his scholarship dubious or even mythological (because of the many scholars influenced by him the past couple of decades) the point is proven that, for the most part, the \\"Afrocentric\\" perspective in Classical scholarship (for lack of a better word) is at best suspect. The very standards of scholarship, philosophy, ethics and erudition Lefkowitz proposes to be defending, however, as seen with a keen eye by the very structure of both the book and its argument, are the ones she seems to have betrayed to prove her point. <br />What exactly are Lefkowitz' credentials regarding the disciplines of Egyptology and anthropology? What does she believe about the findings of mythographers from Frazer (GOLDEN BOUGH) to Godfrey Higgins (ANACALYPSIS) to Gerald Massey (ANCIENT EGYPT, THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD; BOOK OF THE BEGINNINGS) to Burkert (ANCIENT GREEK RELIGION), to MacRitchie (ANCIENT AND MODERN BRITONS), to Roheim; to Campbell (POWER OF MYTH; HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES, etc.) to Camille Paglia (SEXUAL PERSONAE)? <br />What does she think of Nietzsche (BIRTH OF TRAGEDY, etc.)? <br />What are her credentials regarding the history of the sciences, particularly the field of astronomy (exemplified in history by the work of the 19th century astronomer J. Norman Lockyer in DAWN OF ASTRONOMY)?  What does she think of the work of the French late 18th century scientific historian Dupuis' LES ORIGINE DES TOUT LES CULTES [The Origin of All Cults])? Or, perhaps the most important, the science of metrology? (Metrology is the historical/mathematical study of the ancient science of mensuration [measurement]. It fell out of favor inEurope during the ascension of anti-Semitism in the late 19th century; mostly because of the uncomfortable implications its findings proclaimed regarding the *Pre*-Pre-Hellenic source of ancient Greece's entire system of measurement, from weight to length to time--arguably the foundation of all high civilizations.) <br />How do these works, scholars and disciplines shed a new scientific light on the sacred literary cows of her beloved discipline, Classicism, and its evolution? <br />What does she think of the term \\"sociology of knowledge\\" as it applies to the history of Classicism in that context, and does it have any relevance to her? Should it have any relevance to us? <br />And what does Lefkowitz think of the new breed of Israeli/Jewish archaeologists who are tracing more and more aspects of ancient Greece's culture back to its Hebrew/Semitic influences in the same way the \\"Afrocentrics\\" are tracing so many of them back to ancient North Africa, aka Egypt (or is it just easier to risk being called a racist for your views in today's conservative world than it is an anti-Semite, and she doesn't ever plan to say)? <br />You will not find the answers to any of these questions in this book, by design. And without these questions being answered, whether they are openly asked (as I am doing) or just intuitively (as many, whether they admit it or not, eventually will), the thesis of the book as a whole becomes shaky and its stated raison d'Etre profoundly suspect. A cursory glance at even a portion of the books I've mentioned, however, will reveal that virtually ALL of these thinkers and scholars, in their varied disciplines and time periods, agree more with the findings of Afrocentrism than with Lefkowitz, or her book's quasi-sociological theme. Why have virtually all of the above writers and thinkers been omitted in large part from her book, and as such, her intellectual scrutiny, so she could focus on today's Black male intellectuals? <br />In the end my biggest problem with NOT OUT OF AFRICA is obvious--and it has nothing to do with my feelings on Afrocentrism. Lefkowitz' strategy used to debunk Afrocentrism as pagan heresy (beginning with debunking Diop via his methodology but not honestly wrestling with the most substantive aspects of his findings) is both pagan and heretical itself. This loaded intellectual gun of a strategy she's used will mortally wound whatever idea it is pointed at whenever it is fired, regardless of its validity...why all the hoopla about it picking off Black anthropologists, as opposed to White Classicists? <br />Lefkowitz' ironically triumphant refusal to entertain the idea that a paradigm shift is taking place in Classical scholarship (initiated, as most paradigm shifts are, from outside the field) *hidden in a sociological attack on African-American perspectives on it*, reveals something profoundly uncomfortable, yet awfully familiar. It reveals, underneath the laudable superego of her reputation and erudition, a pretty nasty, 19th Century Eurocentric id that is afraid of the quasi-religious chinks in Classicism's academic armor becoming more and more visible to the 21st Century with each passing day. <br />Read this book with an open mind, and you'll hear the sound of it closing before you reach the last page. She's an eloquent writer (hence the three stars), but given 1) the importance of courageously confronting the sociology of knowledge as it has existed for centuries in the scholarly world (not just when Black men in America began being allowed to get graduate degrees in anthropology), and 2) the degree to which she purposely failed to do so for the benefit of capitalizing financially on the \\"reverse-racism\\" Zeitgeist running through conservative America, this is not what true scholarship is about. The last word on this whole issue will probably come from her detractors.	2002-09-11

In today's culture of complaint, people hide bad art and cheap sensational ideas behind political/ideological fads and the automatic public reactions to their support or refutation all the time. Yet even with a healthy skepticism firmly in place, one must look at the thought provoking questions that this book demands are asked--and the near automatic visceral emotions that seem to go with them.<br />I read this book several years ago in college. Though I didn't particularly like the preachy style, or much of the rhetoric seemingly impossible to prove scientifically, it successfully started me on an intellectual journey through a plethora of Egyptological authors of the past two centuries and a spiritual awakening. This book, I am reminded, has such power, because it raises more uncomfortable questions than it answers.<br />Before or even after an opinion of this work has become set in stone in one's mind (usually inspired by an emotional knee-jerk reaction, as if the book is little more than a political metaphor and not an attempt to rediscover the actual ancient world) one must ask themselves, as I was again forced to upon re-reading it:<br />Have you actually READ the book?<br />Have you read inki_snkm@yahoo.com's review of this yet (June 29, 1998)? Were you aware of the facts he brings to light and refers to- more importantly, the intellectual paradigms he used to formulate his opinions, as those are (linguistics specifically)part and parcel of the methods, principles and practices of all Western scholars?<br />Why do you think all architecture schools across all of Western civilization throughout the centuries to today begin their students' studies with the Pyramids?<br />Have you seen the pyramids of the Sudan and Nubia, some predating those of Giza, recently unearthed by German archaeological teams?<br />And what do you think our Founding Fathers (Washington, Jefferson, et al) would have thought of such a work (and think of the back of the dollar bill before you answer)?<br />This book, even with the sermon-like fault of its structure (which says as much about when it was written--and what it took for someone with these kinds of ideas to be published at the time--as the author) remains powerful and influential because of the degree to which it wrestles and answers these kinds of questions. STOLEN LAGACY has its faults, but its ability to make you think, whether you want to or not, isn't one of them.<br />Definitiely worth reading; also worth owning...and continually argued about.Founding Fathers (Washington, Jefferson, et al) would have thought of such a work (and think of the back of the dollar bill before you answer)? <br />This book, even with the sermon-like fault of its structure (which says as much about when it was written--and what it took for someone with these kinds of ideas to be published at the time--as the author) remains powerful and influential because of the degree to which it wrestles and answers these kinds of questions.

US	50366777	R39ZQHXCABLVTW	1564591123	556810145	Dawn of Astronomy	Books	4	9	12	N	N	Classic; one of the first to challenge Classicism's inertia	When volleying back and forth in the specifically designed debate of the sociological value of Afrocentrism vs. Ye Olde Greco-Roman Classicism and traditional Egyptology, it is classic books like these that are purposely ignored by the establishment. This book, and Dupuis' LES ORIGINE DES TOUT LES CULTES (The Origin of All Cults) are two of the most cited books by the rogue scholar Martin Bernal (author of the contraversial BLACK ATHENA: THE AFROASIATIC ROOTS OF CLASSICAL CIVILIZATION) that his detractors, such as Mary Lefkowtiz (NOT OUT OF AFRICA; BLACK ATHENA REVISITED) puposely never mention in their diatribes against him.<br />Lockyer, the 19th century English mathematician and astronomer (not historian or literary scholar-- the source of most of the school of Classicism), did in his time the unthinkable for a scholar in a field that gradually depended upon scholarship devolved into non-scientific dogma: he came up with a theory about the intellectual, scientific and spiritual life of a pre-Hellenic culture in north Africa that went completely against the accepted truisms of common Egyptological opinion... and then proved it to be right. Under no uncertain terms, J. Norman Lockyer--even within the context of the prejudices of his time--completely revolutionized how a north African civilization, whose way of life predates the scientific, mathematical and cultural re-discoveries of the Greeks by thousands of years could be perceived. He did it so well that people are still ignoring it.<br />Ancient Egypt is shown in THE DAWN OF ASTRONOMY to be a civilization based on a philosophical foundation that made cutting edge science, advanced mathematics and esoteric religion one. Pythagorean and Euclidean geometry; the Fibonacci series; the golden section; Pi; the astronomical phenomenon known as the Precession of the Equinoxes (named by the ancient Greeks the \\"Socratic Year\\" some millenia later); the exact length of the solar year, within less than fifteen minutes; the foundational concepts and mathematical formulae of geodesy.... It is all not just written within ancient Egyptian writings, but exemplified in the architecture of every sacred temple built in Egypt from before the Pharonic period (3100 B.C.) on through the Pyramid Age and onward past the Valley of the Kings--millenia before the birth of Pythagoras, Euclid or the entirety of Greece as a culture. Their entire culture, from language to architecture, danced to the rhythm of the stars.<br />Lockyer shows this with an unprecedented detail that to my knowledge has yet to be surpassed. His work demands such a rethinking of our understanding of the roots of Western culture that ignoring his work has left the Freudian denial phase in American intellectual culture and become part of the secular religion of our academic times. (One other rule of the cult, of course, is fairly obvious: declare all provable theories whose nature demand a paradigm shift in our cultural self-perception a modern socio-political metaphor; i.e. nothing more than the amniotic fluid of multiculturalism. This way, regardless of their validity, they can be easily dissected and discredited in that context for the good of the Church of Classicism.  Read Giorgio deSantillana's THE CRIME OF GALILEO, to learn how culturally deep the prejudices and egos of obsessive Greek-based scholarly thinking can impact the world; it becomes a religion more than a science in the blink of an eye.)<br />If so much of what we have seen and heard of this ancient North African culture could actually be reduced to the stuff of modern poetry and superstition (with the mystery of the Pyramids being a beautiful anomaly) as it has been consistently done since Lockyer's time by many (both in and out of the Afrocentric and Classicist/Egyptological schools), it would still be considered an extraordinarily impressive culture. But Lockyer, with painstaking research and enough evidence to fill a city's worth of museums and universities, shows how the rhythm of both the known astronomical universe and the corresponding cycles of nature lay at the center of Egyptian religion and daily life; high science meets high spirit. As much as many Classicists would swear we are still living in Plato or Caesar's world intellectually or culturally speaking, the staggering influence on Rome that Egypt was alone, as shown by Lockyer's explanation of the astronomical basis for their religious architecture and that fact's cultural implications (and how both of those influenced the scientists and architects of Greece and Rome from that point on), shows us how much of an *Egyptian world* we still are living in.<br />Anyone with a passing interest in Egyptology or Astronomy will absolutely love this book. Anyone fascinated by comparitive religions or the origins of astrolgy will be enthralled even moreso. And to anyone prepared to sheepishly quote neo-conservative dogma masquerading as Classicism and simply look for new evidence to boost a socio-political perspective designed to invalidate paradigm-shifting discoveries, I suggest the following: read this in tandem with THE SECRET ARCHITECTURE OF OUR NATION'S CAPITAL: THE MASONS AND THE BUILDING OF WASHINGTON, D.C., by David Ovason.<br />And then beware Dorothy: once you read this you won't be in Kansas anymore.<br />I highly recommend it.ows how the rhythm of both the known astronomical universe and the corresponding cycles of nature lay at the center of Egyptian religion and daily life; high science meets high spirit.

Hilliard<br />And now it's time for a really good book.<br />Ivan Van Sertima, genius anthropologist and author of numerous critically acclaimed books including the international best- seller THEY CAME BEFORE COLUMBUS, is the mastermind behind this collection of essays.  These essays on the largely untold history of people of African descent and their influence on Western Civilization are from authors who have been all but ignored or maligned by much of the scholarly classical intelligentsia for decades (and in some cases centuries).  However, thanks to the changing times, their work and historical perspectives--made practically impregnable with mountains of corroborative archealogical, literary and anthropological evidence--are coming closer to becoming the new standard with each passing generation. If you're a person who has a passing interest in this thing that people have been labelling \\"Afrocentric\\" scholarship for generations now, even from a modern sociological perspective as opposed to historical, this book, in its quilt of various writers, disciplines, perspectives, styles and subjects looped together with the thematic umbrella of Africa's cultural centrality and preeminence in the ancient world and its influence on every Western world in history thereafter, is a great place to start.  Just the same, I would say this is more a book for anyone who, instead of being merely turned on by the intellectual side of the politics of Multiculturalism and Identity in modern times (which, unfortunately, is just another subtle form of applied racism), has found a spark go off in their minds about the subject matter in particular and what it means to the modern human's soul.<br />With Nelson Mandela, Oprah Winfrey, Colin Powell and countless other figures of African descent in late 20th Century culture--not to mention Technology and Globilization's obliterating of the old plantation economic rules--America and Europe has had no need to hold so tightly onto the old rules of racist perspectives on other cultures to maintain a sense of intellectual order or economic/social supremacy. This has been evidenced by many aspects of today's world. Yet it is precisely this visible progress that makes such books as this, returning to a sober, balanced perspective on our actual past--our world history--MORE important, as opposed to not.  There was a time--in fact, when most of the authors listed began writing--when such scholarship was taken as seriously as Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy and Chris Rock on stage. Now times have changed such that the Aryan intellectual paradigms that still govern so much of the unconscious of Western scholarship (wihtout the majority of us even realizing to what degree it has shaped our perspective on society and ourselves) have lost their hold on the world enough to let the light of truthshine in.<br />There is so much information about the African contribution to world civilization that merely contemplating it and its spiritual/cultural implications will create a transformative hunger in you for knowledge that otherwise would have never materialized. This book is a great appetizer in that context--and a great introduction to more than two centuries of wonderful full course meals.<br />As is usually the case with these kinds of books, they need an editor to fix several typographical errors that are pretty unnecessary. That and some of the writings that come off a little bit too much like sermons as opposed to lessons keep this from being a five star book for me. But none of that will stop you from from being fed by it; the bibliographies of each writer's essay alone make the book worth its weight in gold.<br />With works as varied, provocative and mind-blowing as Martin Bernal's lecture on the actual evidence of Ancient pre-Hellenic Greece's colonization by ancient Egypt, English author/professor Edward Scobie's revealing of the history of Black African Popes in the early Catholic church, and many others, this will easily become an important book in the library of anyone who owns it, regardless of ethnic background.

The moralistic materialism of the Ronald Reagan/Wall Street 80's led to the Silicon Valley-influenced psychological spiritualism of the Clinton/Oprah 90's. Collete Dowling, the non-feminist feminist writer and intellectual pioneer, coming of age in the center of this four decade cultural transformation period of Post-World War II American culture (with its pendulum swinging of consciousness between political astuteness and spiritual awareness) wrote this book in 1981.<br />THE CINDERELLA COMPLEX is written from the central and centering vantage point of straight-ahead psychology; not politics or spirituality. It was designed for courageous women ready to reexamine their hearts and souls in the context of the true dynamics and hidden reasons for many of the dysfunctions and even existence of their most important interpersonal relationships. It is even more important now than when it was written.<br />Dowling in actuality was among the first to successfully teach the general public some of the basic ideas of psychology and their relevance to their world, in those changing times, in the context of what freedom and adulthood really means. As it turns out, her metaphor of the Cinderella Complex--the desire to search outside of oneself for the source of inner emotional malaise or turmoil, and to hold a \\"prince\\" of some kind accountable for both one's maturity and rescue from the secret pains of independence--is perfect for all people, men and women.<br />The Cinderella Complex, Dowling shows us, is the siamese twin of irony in life. It is the perfect nickname of the dynamic within people that creates fateful circumstances and negative, self-fulfilling prophecies in a person's life and relationships until its existence is acknowledged. And after it is acknowledged, it asserts itself in a person as an inner war--a psychological jihad--such that it makes the only war you know how to fight and win (i.e. a material-world or male/female relationships war outside of your inner self) irrelevant. Her writing and ideas, as she is saying nothing new yet saying it in such an important new way, sympathetically vibrate with many of the most basic tenets of Western religion. However, her non-religious, psychological perspective allows for a new level of inner healing. Even, if not especially, for those who, unrealizingly, have made a false idol/\\"prince\\" out of Moses, Jesus or Mohammed themselves, along with the living men in their personal lives. Anyone reading this, man or woman, will not just find themselves in it, either as they live now (as I did) or how they once was. You will see much of today's post-Clinton, Bush/Enron 21st Century American culture be revealed in its pages. And, you'll understand why the pleasure principle doesn't make people nearly as happy as many who use the Constitution to defend it want to believe. (And that goes even moreso for the conservative minded than the liberal, as both we pleasure seekers and our \\"drugs\\"--physical/chemical, moral/religious or intellectual/emotional--come in all shapes and sizes.) Even after the coming of John Bradshaw (HOMECOMING [The 90's \\"Inner Child\\" man]), Alice Miller (PRISONERS OF CHILDHOOD: THE DRAMA OF THE GIFTED CHILD; FOR YOUR OWN GOOD), Nancy Friday (MY MOTHER MY SELF; OUR LOOKS OUR LIVES; JEALOUSY), Iyanla Vanzant, Melody Beattie (CODEPENDENT NO MORE) and the litany of other self-help authors still writing, Collette Dowling's ideas are as fresh today as when this book was written more than twenty years ago.<br />THE CINDERELLA COMPLEX in fact towers above even some of the best work of the authors mentioned.<br />It shocks me that this book is not still in print, despite the dozens of books that have come in the years after it riffing on her clearly laid out themes. I bought myself a usedcopy through one seller in perfect condition. And then, considering how much it would have cost new if available now, I bought three more hardcover copies for special people in my life. This book is still among the best of the bridges out there; bridging people into the real potential of the real world, and their real self.

It is so clearly written and so important, that the attributes of this not just life-altering but culture-altering book about the first moments of life for a newborn child cannot be understated. It reads, and to a large degree is constructed, like great poetry--in much the same way the work of Galileo and Darwin and Alice Miller and Stephen Hawking read like epic poetic novels as they sing with human, universal truths.<br />One of the most beautiful things about this book is LeBoyer's confident, unashamed way of admitting that he merely observed a small, hidden community in India and their childbirthing practices. He discovered that their lives in this aspect, and those of their children, were a reflection of, according to Western medical principles, a scientific impossibility. With that discovery he saw the differences between the simplicity of nature, the imposed myopia of culture and the limitlessness of human potential--in an area of human life where he once unconsciously (like most of us) thought the three were essentially one and the same.  He then allowed that to forever change his life.  Consequently, given what he learned, he wrote this masterpiece (given its easy to digest structure, poetic/psychological tone and its overwhelming lack of antecedents), and changed ours. The cultural/philosophical and spiritual bridge from the West to the East he created by this approach to childbirthing is momumental in its implications, in a way most of the New Age literature of the past thirty plus years, including that of American writers who willingly reveal their Eastern philosophical inspiration, really just isn't.<br />This is a beautiful book.  I have one wonderful son. If and when I have other children, this book charts how they will essentially come into the world and spend their first moments in it.  I'll see to it.ilosophical inspiration, really just isn't. <br />This is a beautiful book.  I have one wonderful son.

So many books in the world that people think are incendiary or revolutionary, challenging and rechallenging our conception of free speech, religion, citizenship, science and technology, philosophy, economics and politics or spirituality have an attraction to us because of how they serve as metaphors for the painful realities of our personal lives under the illusions we create for public consumption, and the secrets of our inner selves we wish to uncover. We yearn to break free of something and embrace some inner truth; we just don't know what, and therefore call it some aspect of the outer world. The desires we have to be and have more than what we are, the feelings of not knowing who we truly are and never truly being loved--and the root causes of such feelings--are unveiled in this powerful, disturbing, life shifting and life-affirming book.<br />Alice Miller was one of the patron saints of John Bradshaw, the man whose work heralded the age of the Inner Child that became part of the pop-psychology lexicon of the 90's. Her perspective and conclusions, scientifically, sociologically and philosophically speaking, are practically undebateable. And without even needing the true case examples from her therapeutic practice to underscore her points (which she uses with striking and original clarity and precision across gender, racial, ethnic, cultural and socioeconomic lines), her elucidation of her central thesis on the ignored emotional life of children--and the cost of having parents unequipped to give them the love they need--will undoubtedly make deep seated memories of your own childhood come to the surface.<br />Why does society have such automatic and irrational contempt for the egotist? Why do individulas run to prove themselves (or immediately start thinking of themselves defensively) as the antithesis, upon seeing anyone's character asessed in such a context? Why does even the WORD &quot;self&quot; conjure up confused and uncomfortable feelings when used in anything but a mind-numbing spiritual context with people? What do children need beyond basic nutritional and socioeconomic concerns, and what happens to them when they grow older but do not get it? How is it possible to have more material things and personal achievements than anyone, and still have less and less confidence in who you are?<br />This book can explain things about your adult life and relationships that you'd rather not have so easily and individually explained. And those who look to books like these to figure out what's wrong with their friends, lovers and parents will discover more about themselves than they may think they're ready to process. We all are not just ready but overdue for these kinds of life lessons.<br />Never has a writer, perhaps before or since, put the words &quot;childhood&quot; and &quot;mourning&quot; together in one thought, such that it can create a complete paradigm shift in how one sees oneself, and sees the opportunities for happiness one's world.<br />The fault levied on any psychologist on her level- and there are very, very few- is that this kind of thinking all but demands the kind of narcisstic modern solipsism she seems to diagnose as symptomatic of the illness. (She refers to the dynamic not as an illness, however, but a &quot;tragedy&quot;; keeping us again, I believe, in tune with the ancient Greek mythic/philosophical reference inherent in the old title for this book, &quot;The Drama of the Gifted Child&quot;.) Such blanket criticism of psychology books in general could only be concluded with one of this quality from a misreading of the text; the kind of misreading that usually comes when she has hit a nerve the likes of which one didn't expect, may be afraid of and couldn't imagine beforehand. Nonetheless, taking our culture's preoccupation with the self into consideration, there is still nothing of lasting value one could do in the world without at least endeavoring to answer the existential questions of soul, love, freedom, loss and pain- and the true self- that this book demands you to do in a new way for practically the rest of your life.<br />I gave it four stars instead of five because it was too short. I didn't want it to end. And the idea that she could 1) prove her point, 2)deeply affect me by making me dream dreams that I've never dreamed before, 3)access undramatic but painful memories of childhood events that I forgot happened but have been behind more than half of the seemingly unrelated choices I've made in my adult life, and 4) feel a usually suppressed rage and grief give way to a new sense of purpose and a release of joyful energy and optimism- all in a little more than a hundred pages- still makes me queasy. In other words, read this as a five and a half star review! Then buy the book, put down the most recent bash on modern politics and the latest neo-spiritual mind candy on the bestseller's list, and begin a real journey.least endeavoring to answer the existential questions of soul, love, freedom, loss and pain- and the true self- that this book demands you to do in a new way for practically the rest of your life. <br />I gave it four stars instead of five because it was too short.

The title of this incredible, clearly thought out, brilliantly edited and masterfully written book may lead you to believe that it is all about a seemingly benign issue. Make no mistake: what this book is actually about are 1) the actual definition of the surgical practice and 2) the social, economic, sociological, psychological and anthropological forces that go into us seeing it that way. And, how the prevailing of those forces keep us from actually being a totally civilized society. <br />Dr. Goldman effectively teaches in this book, from the anthropological perspectives of such luminaries as Ashley Montagu and Margaret Mead, that circumcision is a practice that is older than all recorded history and religions. And the practice, in and out of a religious context, continues. Dr. Goldman shows us from the purely medical/health/surgical perspective (with an avalanche of evidence and corroborative opinions in the medical profession) that circumcision is a practice that has little to no medical health value, and was once actually called a cure for masturbation and cancer by last century's medical community. Yet the implausible and unscientific theories justifying its existence keep coming up, and the practice continues. Dr. Goldman shows us, amazingly, from an internationally sociological and cultural perspective, that the United States is the only Industrialized nation in the modern world that has the overwhelming majority of its infant boys be subjected to the practice. Yet the practice continues. Dr. Goldman shows us, from an ethics in medicine perspective, that circumcision is a practice that, by virtue of the harm done to infant children physically and psychologically--with little to no up side beyond the money going to obstetricians and pediatricians for the procedure--completely rips to shreds any conception of the Hippocratic oath and turns the entire life of any doctor who performs them routinely into a profoundly dangerous lie. <br />Yet the practice continues. <br />It is an old anthropologist's dictum that the most important thing to know about a culture is what it takes for granted. Dr. Ronald Goldman, with CIRCUMCISION, THE HIDDEN TRAUMA gives us not only the hidden, true anatomy of the surgical process, along with the actual complete and (heretofore to my knowledge in everyday America) unknown anatomy of the human male, but also the secret architecture of the social forces and weaknesses that make up the ritualised American denial of the inherently violent nature of its existence. Dr. Goldman shows in this both innovatively and exhaustively researched book that the entire surgical procedure of circumcision depends on the total invalidation of the soul of the infant male child and their personhood for its existence in medicine. Only paleolithic theories of the child feeling no pain and suffering no lasting or remembered traumatic side effects from the procedure--WHICH ROUTINELY INVOLVES THE USE OF NO ANESTHESIA-- justify its medical practice; and fly in the face of all kinds of logic while doing so. <br />I learned from this book that the practice of circumcision may be, perhaps unlike anything else--including war or rape--the ultimate metaphoric symptom of the schizophrenia of Western civilization. Only because Dr. Goldman, who doesn't even go as fully into the anthropological and philosophical implications of his findings as he could have, makes it so clear that our treatment of infant children as they go, under violent duress, under the knife for no apparent reason could be playing a principal role in the genesis of ALL of the cultural diseases of mankind--from child abuse to rape to murder to war. <br />I along with most of the country (and again, our United States is the *only* industrialized country in the world that still practices circumcision routinely on the overwhelming majority of its newborn boys--this includes all of Europe and a major chunk of the Middle East) have never seen pictures of or witnessed a circumcision; part of the reason I saw no problem in it when I picked this book up. The *pictures* in this book alone of children in the process of being circumcised will change your way of looking at the practice forever--as it has changed me and mine forever. Picture an adult male going through the process of circumcision, complete with his hands, arms and legs forceably bound in industrial strength velcro to keep him from being able to interrupt a surgical process performed on his perfectly healthy sex organ against his will--again, *without anesthesia*--and the first thought that will probably come to your mind is one of two things: the electric chair, or Nazi Germany. <br />Which by definition takes away the mystery of how BOTH in the 20th century could have come into existence. <br />I discovered Dr. Goldman's work in the bibliography of one of the seminal books by the psychologist champion of the human child Alice Miller (author of, among other classics in the field, FOR YOUR OWN GOOD, BANISHED KNOWLEDGE and PRISONERS OF CHILDHOOD--THE DRAMA OF THE GIFTED CHILD). Between this, Alice Miller's work, and William Dufty's SUGAR BLUES, I feel as if I have the answer to why our culture can move so far forward and fall so far backward on the evolutionary ladder at the same time. The door separating Western culture from the embrace of higher consciousness, as told to us by poets, mystics,yogis, leaders of ancient religions, transpersonal psychologists and theoretical physicist/philosophers, is our view of the spiritual and physical completeness of the human child--and the actions we take upholding that view. <br />That door is locked with a dead bolt called CIRCUMCISION. And even unlocking the door, as Europe has already shown us, does not by definition mean opening it. But without unlocking it opening it isn't posible. <br />Read this if you have to in small doses, but read it; it will change the way you view our world.	2002-03-27

There is an intellectual and quite possibly deep, artistic insecurity that owns him, however, and seems to bleed through and desecrate his often brilliant perspectives and erudition.  To the point, in some areas, of it being as palpable as the dramatic subtext of the operas in which he wants to teach you how to sing.  He has a way a tainting a magnificent introduction to otherwise unknown or unthought-about topics of interest with pedantry, old style elitism, pre-Nietzschean, 19th Century anthropology-based aesthetics, and even the occasional sprinkling of pure racism. (There is actually a comment about \\"ghetto youth\\" on one early chapter, regarding their supposed cognitive inability to think and plan for the future of their lives in total, as compared to an educated white [read: suburban] professional.  I kid you not.  As a bass-baritone from the Bronx who WAS \\"a ghetto youth\\" and has fulfilled many a grade school dream by singing in probably more foreign countries and great European stages than he has, if I weren't USED to coming up against such primitive preconceptions in my professional life [and as such acquainted with the artistic insecurity that usually produces them], it would have offended me too much to get the unrelated point about singing and the mind he was trying to make.)<br />And yet, how often could a singer find a vocal pedagogy book that makes references to the humanist psychology of Abraham Maslow, among others?<br />Many of his references to similiar topics make the book worth a great deal, even if the price is a bit over the top (get a library copy). His graphs of the vocal mechanism and surrounding musculature, for example--not to mention those of the brain--transcend many of the helpful anatomical references of the books of the famous authors previously mentioned on the topic. He thinks so clearly, and communicates information so lucidly, that many of his biases are forgiveable. (Not all, but many of them.)<br />As his subjective points of view about people (of various races and ethnic backgrounds), art (of various cultures and European styles) and life in general have a subtle but greater negative psychological impact than he is probably aware, I would recommend his book only to the more advanced and older singer. In other words, a singer mature enough to instinctively separate the wheat of his voluminous, well explained material and challenging scientific perspectives from the chaff of his quasi-sociological and antequated aesthetic opinions.eviously mentioned on the topic.

And we are amazed, even if quietly so, because Bach always seems to have reinvented music by rediscovering what the language truly is; spiritually reexplaining the music we have grown up hearing--even if it's other classical or cerebral jazz--as one of many dialects. Hearing a masterpiece of Bach's affects us in the end only slightly differently than anything he ripped off in an hour or two for his church chorus before or after.  To our souls, the fact that he introduced us to the hidden language of beauty is equally if not more important than even the greatest example of the poetry that, via the language, he created.<br />Change that metaphor to the jazz of Coltrane, the plays of Shakespeare, the art of Picasso, the universe view of Einstein or what ever you like; this is the effect one feels when reading the psychological work of Alice Miller. This being my fourth book of hers I'm in the middle of reading, I don't bother with rating them according to which is better or worse; each one clearly and eloquently reveals a different facet of the diamond that is the tortured but beautiful soul of Western civilization, and perhaps all of humanity. Alice Miller puts us in touch with the obviously LOST language of the soul of the human child. And she does it to such a degree that you feel that language begin to speak YOU once again, the way it did when you were three or four years old, with every incredible common sense discovery she shares about the actual nature and genesis of culture and its many beliefs. All of her books do this. This is perhaps the paradox that will never cease to amaze you with all of her work, and especialy this one.<br />With FOR YOUR OWN GOOD, Alice Miller shows you the nature, origins and source of human evil. What made Hitler and Eichmann Hitler and Eichmann; how it relates to the secret psychological pains of common people in 1930's and 40's Germany, 19th century England, and every other society and time; what, hiding behind religion and moral philosophy, nearly murders the soul of children--and is still sanctioned by Western culture as integral parts of \\"child-rearing\\". The clarity with which you will see the mystified world in which we live behind the smoke and mirrors of complex philsophies, contradictory historical perspectives and socio-political theories, is simultaneously invigorating and disheartening. You see the degree to which the simplest, most obvious explanation for evil has been so painfully ignored, and the sad, sad reasons as to why; but Miller's writing style and genius makes you feel hope after doing so. Instead of feeling as if your soul has been murdered, even after seeing forgotten aspects of your own childhood slowly and unexpectedly reappear before your eyes like a polaroid picture developing on certain pages and chapters, you feel as if it has simply been frozen against your will--and now you are armed with the technology to thaw it out and discover who you truly are.<br />Alice Miller with FOR YOUR OWN GOOD gives us the behavioral anatomy of evil in human history via charting both the history and psychological effects of \\"poisonous pedagogy\\": inferior and abusive child-rearing practices that become so unconscious to a people as to become definitive of a culture. Evil is demystified with this book, and as such begins to immeidately lose its power and becomes what theologians of every religion have (unsucessfully) tried to wish it into being for millenia: nothing more than the shadow--the absence--of goodness.<br />Read this book of hers in particular, and you will never say some version of \\"the children are our future\\" quite the same way again.cal pains of common people in 1930's and 40's Germany, 19th century England, and every other society and time; what, hiding behind religion and moral philosophy, nearly murders the soul of children--and is still sanctioned by Western culture as integral parts of \\"child-rearing\\".

But this book is entertaining the way Aesop's fables are entertaining; the life lessons of it keep returning like Springtime after long, cold winters.<br />Orwell wrote this after discovering many of the intrinsic horrors of Communism in the Soviet Union and elsewhere before and after World War II. The political hypocrises and subsequent crimes inherent in the movement were made all the more genocidally infectious to innocent people around the world in the way they always are in political movements: by the leaders' demands of people to look at the culturally genocidal infections of the \\"other\\" (in this case laissez faire capitalism and its resultant colonialist/imperialist criminalities in the West), instead of allowing the independent questioning of the relevance and righteousness of what they were dealing with. The Frankenstein impulse of Man's ego as it governs the creation of utopianesque political systems and quasi-cultures has been alluded to many times before and after this novel (even before Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN), but for me never so succinctly, so beautifully, and so painfully accurate as ANIMAL FARM.<br />I just bought this novel for my son, age twelve. I bought it for him not just knowing that he loves animals and stories about animals (a way Dads like me sneak good literature in their system). As he approaches the (help me Lord) teen years where the peer group becomes everything, he will need to know that he can be caught in the same dynamic that the innocent and naive animals underneath the leadership of the pigs were caught up in. (Hearing me lecture about it would naturally have the opposite effect.) Hearing a confused but charismatic kid begin to sound a lot like Squealer in a new and unexpected context for him just might save his power of independent thought when peer pressure comes into play.<br />If I could, I would buy this book for half the world, and let them give their dog-eared copy to the other half; there is no one whose life isn't touched by the intoxicating rhythm of power in groups, and its ability to lead people into total bondage of some sort while it promises to protect your freedom. For example: any and every woman I've ever known who felt the need to regurgitate feminist manifestos at their future ex boyfriends and husbands in order to protect the integrity of an illusory sisterhood--a sisterhood often run by women who would (and often are) sleeping with the very men these confused but loyal women have alienated in their name, needs to read this. Nancy Friday's MY MOTHER, MY SELF and Daphne Patai's HETEROPHOBIA are ANIMAL FARMs for the independent American Woman, struggling to truly know herself beyond the confines of patriarchy, its postmodern discontents, and any culture set up to combat it. For anyone starting the next round of self-improvement courses lauded by the newest pop-psychology guru that have this funny way of feeling like they are not actually leading you anywhere, the work of Stanford Peele, heretic of the twelve step program community, has written several ANIMAL FARMs on this self-help/addiction philosophy, serving them as well as all of us in innumerable ways. For those devoted to a pretty cerebral psychoanalytic perspective on life, or an often emotionally/socially detached Church or creed, psychologist/author Alice Miller's work are in different ways ANIMAL FARMs of their own: they are for the psychologically/transformation-minded who alternately pay too much surface and too liitle in-depth attention to childhood's true effect on the adult human heart...Steele's THE CONTENT OF OUR CHARACTER and Tony Brown's WHITE LIES, BLACK LIES are both ANIMAL FARMs for the Black Community--a community that may only truly take control of its (our) owndestiny if we start looking for spiritual/economic *colonics*, instead of socio-political streetsweepers...<br />The metaphors are endless, and endlessly fitting. ANIMAL FARM's power is that it is so deceptively powerful in its simplicity as to make the point only writers of powerful insight, intellect and above board courage can do, regarding what happens to men and women in groups when power becomes intoxicating. And today they need several hundred more pages and a million footnotes to do it AT ALL, let alone as well as Orwell did. It resonates in ways that force you to think beyond the conventional in life (i.e., the pre-programmed), and begin a search to find out what reality really is, for YOU, not someone else.<br />If Jesus came back and was asked to give a sermon for the people of every nation, he would instead tell the world a parabel that would essentially be this book.own destiny if we start looking for spiritual/economic *colonics*, instead of socio-political streetsweepers...<br />The metaphors are endless, and endlessly fitting.

If the analyst is frightened of the real history of his own science, he will never be able to face the past of any of his patients...The time has come to cease from hiding from what is, after all, one of the great issues of human history.\\"<br />Jeffery Moussaieff Masson<br />THE ASSAULT ON TRUTH<br />From the Conclusion<br />In the wake of the cultural shifts going on regarding our awareness of childhood trauma and sexual abuse throughout Western civilization--history and present day--one could easily be led to believe, particularly if you are not into psychology, that a book of this nature is not nearly as relevant as it might have been twenty years ago.  I felt that when I saw it advertised and even read someone's review about it almost a year ago, and didn't buy it until recently.  Now, after finishing it and being floored, I am reminded of one of Shopenhauer's famous maxims: there are three stage of an emerging truth; first it is ridiculed or ignored, second it is violently opposed...<br />...and third, it is accepted as self-evident.<br />The genius that is Freud's and his contribution to World civilization is clearly evident, but it is wrapped up and to a large degree tainted by the cult of the Oedipal complex he created at the dawn of the last century.  Make no mistake, Jeffrety Masson proves that a comparison of Freud to Jim Jones or even Hitler is equally as valid as a comparison of him to Darwin, Galileo or Christ.  He had a great deal invested in a scientific myth--and its secret, propagandistic granting of moral amnesty to the bourgeois Viennese scientific community and corrupt, secretly horrific aspects of its society.  And with that foundational myth (that supported a power structure that has since been one of the most influential in the world: psychoanalysis), he took part in the prevention of the achievement of mental health that has indirectly shaped many of the horrors of the twentieth century.<br />When one looks into the past with the revisionist eyes of a society that is now aware--somewhat--of the destructive power of culture-sanctioned child abuse, you look at the growth of Nazism, Stalinism and Maoism, and the biographies of the men who led these revolts--specifically their childhoods...you look at the products of laissez faire capitalism and colonialism--that which itself produced the plantation slave trade and created the foundational myth of racial supremacy in America...you look at the worldwide international businesses of illegal drugs and forced prostitution--the consumers and producers of which are mostly abused children themselves...<br />...you look at how a courageous look at the role of child abuse on the human psyche creates personality--which creates public policy and nations--and how it could have prevented some or all of this from occuring, and instead of saying \\"Wow!

It has been said for years that cinema is where art and commerce meet...and in the eighties art went home.  Ian Grey basically explains how the little piggy that went home that is art--people with something to say--in American cinema, was told to go, and why it still is staying there.<br />The anecdotes can be funny; the social commentary is often fascinating.  The double standards and schizophrenic ideals concerning the standard for portraying violence in film is such a powerful social statement on our society that it is worth the price of admission by itself (irony thy name is horror movie ratings system: the message behind the standards do more harm to society than the films that fall beneath it).  The only problem is what is easily detectable in Ian Grey's outlook or personality. Ian sounds a lot like the famous preachers obsessively pointificating on the wages of sin in front of the bordellos: you know, the ones who are on a first name basis with the madams and the most expensive of the employees!  In other words, there are few times in the book that you don't get the impression that he is one gig or sold superficial action movie screenplay away from refuting virtually all of what he wrote here and living it up with the very people he is trashing.  There is a thin line between simple insiders and true heretics; Ian seemingly wrote a book that, instead of having him hung in effigy by the elite and run out of town, will seemingly merely have him be heretofore excluded from only all of the very Hollywood parties he no longer wants to go to.  Which means, well, the obvious: the real elite of elites in Hollywood are having as much fun with his book as he is.<br />Just the same, whether the leit motif of sour grapes is or is not running through this symphonic critique of the devolution of the art form of American movies over the past two decades, you learn a lot about how the business is run--or how this Frankenstein runs itself.  When I think of how difficult it must be to get a screenplay or acting career established in Hollywood, his book simultaneously deflates a lot of secret hopes, and reinspires a belief in the redemptive power of artistic integrity over fame.

Its existential inadequacy in charting the anatomy of the soul (which is what the word \\"psyche\\" means) comes up in virtually every psychoanalysed person and derivative doctrine and explains much if not most of the profound failures of the entire discipline in Western society this past century (and, definitively, people's lack of faith in it). It's as if Freud, like Shakespeare or Bach, created a new language with many of the materials of the popular one being used; only unlike Shakespeare or Bach then chose, because of the martyrdom that sticking to his real discoveries demanded of him, to basically backpeddle and translate all of the same antequated ideas he should have replaced into it. Camille Paglia of SEXUAL PERSONAE was the first person I ever heard say that people who try to judge Freud on scientific terms miss the point that he wasn't trying to make science; he was making art. Alice Miller proves she was right, only the art he created hurt people as much as it helped, as his theories of the innate sexual drives of children are based on--but has little to no basis in--the hidden, unspoken reality of the lives of children: powerless against the love, power and abuse of sexually conflicted adults.<br />Alice Miller redefines common sense with her perspective, by replacing your view of history and present day reality. To read her books is to begin to be free, know your inner grief, release it, and be reconnected with your vitality, creativity and joy. In charting Western society's betrayal of the human child, the grief one feels upon its discovery through her is unavoidable. But the secret life and hidden potential one discovers of the human child, through being once again reacquainted with the truth of their (our) infinite posiibilites for growth and transformation--if only left to do so--is astounding. True, if you have ever found yourself brought nearly to tears over stories of child abuse, seeing how prevalent it is and what its actual impact on the world is via reading this will be hard for you to take. But if you ever wondered what really separates the Bill Gateses and Michael Jordans, etc. from the rest of us, because a little voice keeps telling you its something other than exceptional talents, this book, in taking the mystery out of what creates happiness and inner peace, could change your life.of children are based on--but has little to no basis in--the hidden, unspoken reality of the lives of children: powerless against the love, power and abuse of sexually conflicted adults.<br />Alice Miller redefines common sense with her perspective, by replacing your view of history and present day reality.

It seems as if I am swept up in the Post-Postmodern, Post-feminist paradigm, because some of the most important thinkers of the past several years--Camille Paglia, Barbara Ehrenreich, Jenny Wade, and now Daphne Patai--seem to come out of this school of thought.<br />I won't go into exhaustive detail about the meticulous and even handed diagnosis of this cultural movement known as the Sexual Harrassment Industry that Patai offers.  Suffice it to say that it will be all but impossible to not compare it to the Spanish Inquisition, the Salem Witch trials, the Viennese fin de siecle anti-Semitism that festered in Europe before World War I  (leading to the full blown Nazism in Germany after the German loss), or the McCarthy Communist-hunter movement when you are done with this book.  Whether or not you agree with the sentiment (or the evidence), this book makes these types of comparisons possible, as it gives you the ability to look at this issue of sexual harrassment--and the anti-cultural, anti-scientific, anti-common sense and, definitively, dysfunctional perspective on heterosexuality driving certain factions of the feminist movement--with open eyes.  Patai helps us to separate the feminists from the \\"Feminazis\\" with this book, and bring clarity--even sanity--back to one of the oldest and most important ongoing discussions about equality, fairness and culture in a good society for the future of our children.<br />This book is to Feminism what Orwell's ANIMAL FARM is to the story of politics, neo-theology and power's effect on the human soul in any formation.  There are few books out now that reach, from as far away as the mysterious courtroom and the stale academic classroom, this far into our unexamined everyday lives--in much the same way other people would want, only for a different ends.<br />Another very important book for our new century.people would want, only for a different ends.<br />Another very important book for our new century.	2002-02-17

It has been said that the primal characteristic of a truly enlightened mind is its ability to entertain two seemingly contradictory ideas at the same time; in that context I find it odd that people can be so proud of their total discrediting of Said's work in favor of the preeminent and (seemingly) diametrically opposed Bernard Lewis. It is obvious to me that both men have something provocative to teach us about Europe and America's relationship with the Middle East (as it has been over the centuries and is reflected in culture and scholarship), and both need to be heard in that context.<br />It is not often that a brilliantly, exhaustively researched book on an alternatingly controversial and trivialized subject can engender an emotional response of the magnitude with which this work does--which usually means that it is worth reading. In documenting the psychological architecture of the western mind and its perspective on the East--or the \\"Orient\\"--he deconstructs it. The idea that it exists deconstructs it by nature; before reading this book you will swear that most of what we know of the Arabian East is the absolute truth, without even being aware that it's been either romanticized into impotence or isn't much of anything complimentary, let alone influential.<br />I rate ORIENTALISM, for its effect on our psyche as Americans alone (regardless of race or assumed political leanings), as one of the most important books written in the last decades of the 20th century. The world looks the way it does not because of natural law, like the reasons why the Sahara has become a desert--or at least not by the natural laws we have imagined. Edward Said, regardless of the possibility of biases coming through his scholarship, regardless of the political realities he left out of his thesis, shows this in remarkable fashion to people--like myself--who never considered this fact's existence (let alone its influence on my perceptions of the Middle East in all their forms).<br />Be mature enough to accept that it is not the only educated opinion or set of facts about our complex world, and this book will be a great read and teach a great deal.  I would suggest triangulating ORIENTALISM with Karen Armstrong's HOLY WAR and Moseddeq Ahmed's WAR ON FREEDOM, for a truly eye-opening experience of the Western psyche regarding the East.is fact's existence (let alone its influence on my perceptions of the Middle East in all their forms).<br />Be mature enough to accept that it is not the only educated opinion or set of facts about our complex world, and this book will be a great read and teach a great deal.

More than the ocean of tomes recently produced on the psychology of Osama bin Laden and the Taliban (and the Middle East as a whole), or those depicting the consequences of biological and chemical weaponry on American soil, Barbara Ehrenreich has, with this book, surpassed the innovative, seminal and profoundly contraversial scholarship of anthropology, psychology and political science of the past thirty years.<br />BLOOD RITES: ORIGINS AND HISTORY OF THE PASSIONS OF WAR is one of the greatest, most frightfully illuminating books I've ever read. In the context of unified-field, \\"theory of everything\\" books on culture and the human psyche--the holistic/spherical direction into which Western consciousness seems to be finally heading--this book ranks with work like the 19th century Godfrey Higgins' ANACALYPSIS, scientific mythographer Alan Alford's WHEN THE GODS CAME DOWN, Camile Paglia's SEXUAL PERSONAE, linguist Kuhn's THEORY OF SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTIONS and CHANGES OF MIND by philsopher/psychologist Dr. Jenny Wade.  I believed few works in this new discpline of evolutionary psychology/anthropology could ever come close to the impact of THE IMPERIAL ANIMAL by Tiger and Fox.  Ehrenreich, however, with BLOOD RITES, via encapsulating all of their discoveries within an even newer and more all-encompassing paradigm, surpasses it with a quantum leap.<br />Ehrenreich's idea is that the primal fear of predation of Paleolithic man has driven much of what we know as the genesis of culture, from religion to war. Early man's very real fear of being eaten alive in the jungle by much physically stronger animals, back when early human kind/hominids didn't leave willingly but was forced out of the trees by climatic changes in the Savannahs of central Africa--is the generative force behind the primal rituals of the blood. These rituals--blood rites--symbolize the eventual supremacy over the man-eating animals via man learning to hunt even better, and subsequently successfully fight for their survival as a species. In other words, they symbolize the ultimate transformation of the jungle: prey to predator. These rituals, with their corresponding symbol meaning, are the DNA of culture itself.<br />The reenactment of this rite in every human community--the transformational ritual that told the story of mankind's most humble and frightened beginnings--in turn created much of society as it exists even today; from the characteristics of ancient culture's many gods and the corresponding behavioral architecture of ancient religions...to the shape and purpose of modern day war.<br />How Ehrenreich proves her point will change the way you look at everything, including many other historically intellectuals and the actual validity of their ideas, regardless of how foundational to our culture they may seem. Particularly because so many influential thinkers and philosophers of the past three centuries have consciously and unconsciously based their theories of human existence on a now defunct paradigm: the unvanquished hunter-gatherer man of Neolithic times as the beginning of human civilization and thought. Ehrenreich reveals this foundational idea to be a myth of its own. *That alone*, when contemplating its implications, will change the way you look atliterally everything--especially the true horror that is war.<br />This is a book to be experienced, moreso than simply read. Those whose hearts question obvious things, like why the irrationality of war continuously re-demands supremacy over our lives, will have many questions answered by this work. But for those whose questions go deeper...deeper into the intellectual architecture of Western man and its place in the human psyche...for those who understand, who feel, but lack the words to explain the feeling of seeing an ignored pink polka-dotted elephant on the coffee table of every celebrated thinker of the past--from Descartes to Hobbes to Rouseau to Darwin to Nietzsche to Freud to feminist Susan Faludi...for those who question it all, but even the fairly current answers to so much of why culture is what it is only yields more questions, this book will change you in ways that could not be predicted. It is books like these for which Kuhn's term *paradigm shift* was created.<br />And instead of like a college textbook, its 250-odd pages read like a novel.

Its recreation of the world through which Jesus walked is as real as blood. Ultimately, Mailer convinces, more than any writer before him, that for Jesus the man it could have been just like this; and that is, in itself, some sort of literary miracle.&quot;I am barely through half of this eight hundred odd page masterwork.  Yet I am already amazed by Mailer's ability to  penetrate the human heart of the civilization of the spiritual, highly advanced, mysterious Ancient Egypt with ANCIENT EVENINGS.<br />Mailer seeminngly captures Egypt during a period that could be  easily considered antithetically decadent to its many periods of great glory like the First Dynasty's uniting of the &quot;The Two Lands,&quot; the Pyramid Age, the 12th Dynasty or the famous 18th, with Akhenaton, Nefertiti, and King Tut.  Or, heartbreakingly enough for romantic Egyptophiles like myself, he could be capturing how everyday Egypt, underneath the pomp and circumstance of the persepective of an Egyptologist or the Kingly/Pharonic court ritual (much like Rome millenia later) actually was.<br />Mailer has always been accused of personalizing himself too much in his work, and the evidence of twentieth century left-of-center White American bohemian life and culture, as well as its self-projected/narcississtic perspective on ancient Egyptian culture, does at times bleed through.  African people South of Egypt are referred to in the novel as Negroes or Blacks.  (Ancient Egyptian people, Pharaohs and rulers--those that weren't actually fully Black themselves--saw much greater differences amongst peoples regarding religions, kingdoms/class, language and geography than the modern world has taught us to believe about the myth of race and skin color.  Such distinctions regarding non-Nilotic or non-North African African peoples [as the Egyptians were North African peoples whose language was in a family of languages shared by many peoples in a thousand mile radius], let alone quasi-contemptuous ruminations on them [patricularly considering the ancient Ethiopian, Dogon or Sudanese] would not have been made then as Mailer makes them when he wrote this, he being a product of pre-integrationist America).  The conversations about that strange tribe known as the Hebrews are equally reflective of Biblical story and cultural influence as opposed to ancient Egyptian.  (And of course, as the Torah/Old Testament was written many centuries after ANCIENT EVENING's story takes place, the Egyptian take on the Hebrews would be either far less interesting and mythologically significant to them, or interesting to the Pharoahs and religious leaders in a way that would change our entire concept of Western culture if it were revealed.)  Most of all though, even for a left of center, non-homophobic artist like myself who knows the value of sexual freedom in artistic expression, the rampant and graphic scenes of homosexual dalliances and rapes are just a wee bit much for me (!).<br />Just the same, Mailer's ability to weave the complexity of emotions, personalities, issues, struggles, strange powers, human potentialities and overall mysticism of the civilization and its people into a treatise on its understanding of the human spirit and the singular mystery of one continuously suspense-weaving plot, is already captivating me in magical ways.<br />After working for years at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Department of Egyptian Art in New York, my enjoyment of reading this novel, which may have been a closet favorite of many of my curator friends, is greatly enhanced.  I highly recommend this for anyone who likes Mailer, ancient Egyptian art and civilization, and a fascinating mystery.

Ultimately, Mailer convinces, more than any writer before him, that for Jesus the man it could have been just like this; and that is, in itself, some sort of literary miracle&quot;.<br />Publishers Weekly<br />(Quoted from the back cover of THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO THE SON, paperback)<br />I cannot think of a more perfect book to read and give as gifts for the Holidays, to people of all faiths OR lack thereof.<br />I have heard for years that Norman Mailer's ego, with its supposedly massive size, has this way of getting in the way of his message and transcendant literary skill in everything he writes; as if there is a watermark of his opinion of himself printed on every one of his sentences that becomes visible when you hold them up to the light of day.  Though that isn't my excuse for not reading any of his work before this, I can only imagine how much jealousy lay in the hearts of those who proclaim this as a caveat whenever his work hits the market and touches the surface of the universal human heart after reading THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO THE SON.  Far from attempting to completely de-spiritualize or Freudian-ize Jesus into spiritual insignificance, Norman Mailer attempts--and for me is successful--at something far more creative, courageous and important.<br />Mailer, with THE GOSPEL... allows for new spiritual and compassionate eyes to see the Christ, via giving the documents describing the life and Tao of Jesus in the New Testament a completely different context and perspective.  He reveals the hidden dynamic of the unconscious deification of the writers of the synoptic gospels--and their writings--that not only runs centuries deep, back into the early stages of the Catholic Church, but perhaps is the genesis of the environment which necessitated the appearance of the Son of Man and his  revolutionary message among the Hebrews in Jerusalem in the first place--centuries before he came.  And then Mailer returns THEM, not Jesus, back into the very human, epic poet/journalist-symbols of the Ancient Near East Matthew, Mark, Luke, John and Paul originally were; making an unconscious debate over THEIR message (as opposed to Jesus') masquerading as love of Christ, intellectual sophistication or piety--yea or nea--irrelevant.  All by trying to tell Jesus's story in something of his own words.<br />Nietzsche has said in HUMAN, ALL TOO HUMAN that it is the degree to which one can display a most positive vision or illusion of ONESELF that decides and structures both the opinion we have of people, places and things in the world and the way in which we express it: the Narcissistic impulse of man's ego. Mailer's courage is in revealing this truism's agonizing power, as it may have infused the very religion to which much of Western Civilization has turned to rise above such ego-burdened ways.  But his talent shows itself in how this work is nearly devoid of lambast or criticism of those caught in such paradims over the millenia and today, as it enters the loving, complex, but forgiving heart of his subject--the subject of it all.  He does this by making us hear Christ; not from the point of view of people who wrote about him many decades after his death/ascenscion, but from an artistic one, a representation of the voice of Christ himself.  An artistic representation so compassionate as to, in some passages, incomparably touch the heart and reawaken the soul.<br />The courage to attempt this would be in and of itself--even in the context of hubris--worth congratulating regardless of success.  The compassion to lift oneself beyond judgement and culturally acceptable evaluation and go straight to the heart of such a profound subject, and then write a new yet familiarly compassionate view of the man/spirit, would also be laudable even if it failed to move you.  And the erudition necessary to make ancient Jerusalem, Rome, Cairo, Bethlehem and Gallilee come alive alone would make it an enjoyable read, even if the subject and purpose of it all was lost and missed.  Norman Mailer didn't just combine all three of these essential gifts and distill out most of the possible downsides associated with them with THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO THE SON.  I counted only about four or five times in all 200-odd pages of the book (totalling maybe ten or fifteen lines of text) where the presence of a 20th century man with his own opinions about life, religion and his own significance bled through the gentle, non-sentimental, purely magnificent poetic prose.<br />Norman's personal trinity of courage, compassion and erudition created this vehicle, via which he let his spirit/muse and it's Gabriel-like message for us rise above the confines of his ego. (And, again, as I've never met him, that ego may still be being overexaggerated by those in a culture that, unlike the eyes of the Christ, cannot see the many ironic forms of it's own arrogance.) As such, this book--if only for a moment (smile)-- can have you doing the same for the Holidays.<br />I rate this so close to five stars that I might as well call it that: a five star beautiful achievement.

That is a psychological fact. But in my opinion it is past time we stopped poisoning and confusing ourselves by calling them &quot;feminine&quot; and began calling them by their name: LUNAR traits... To be human is to access both the solar and the lunar aspects of our common humanity, and to experience their eternal cross-pollination.&quot;<br />&quot;Where PLUTO lies in the birth chart, we are particularly vulnerable to distortions and navigational errors based on un- processed wounding [life] experiences...if you are pretending to be happy in your job, your friendships, relationships, religion, whatever, a Pluto...event will try to reveal that to you...what if a ...person makes a less than optimal response? The basic Plutonian contract is simple to say: you go to the dark or the dark comes to you...&quot;<br />&quot;No one has ever been, or can ever expect to be, nurtured perfectly. Parents are only human. Communities are flawed. The Shadow makes itself felt sooner or later in every life...on one hand, there is a temptation to say, &quot;So quit your whining!&quot; But so easily that can generate into denial and avoidance... On the other hand, there is the toxic-psychologist's exhortation that we reduce our lives to a resentful meditation upon our wounds. And given life's richness and brevity, isn't that a foolish waste?&quot;<br />from Steven Forrest, THE BOOK OF PLUTO<br />For anyone intuitively saddened and subsequently turned off by the perceived stereotypes and actual limitations of both the disciplines of psychology and astrology, this alchemical book, combining the profound and cleansing essences of both in simple terms, will steer you down a very interesting and enlightening path. We &quot;know&quot; that astrology is much more than the sun signs you read in the newspaper or magazines. We &quot;know&quot;, ironically enough, that many of the secular patron saints of many a religious conservative have been well known to use and follow the advice of professional astrologers (Ronald and Nancy Reagan immediately come to mind). But do you really believe that there is something you can be truly taught by this discipline, beyond how popular it can make you among progressive or artistic friends when you bring it up?<br />If you already do, you will get even more out of this book than you currently would think. Steven Forrest's approach is one that combines some of the essential ideas of modern psychology--Jungian and Freudian--with the metaphysical wisdom of the ancient and modern astrologer (and some of his own silly sense of humor) into a book that teaches you as much about yourself as it does the methods, overarching purpose and intrinsic, trans-cultural social value of this often maligned, millenia-old science/art form. If you have ever felt that the fundamentals of psychological perspectives on the human mind and heart and the astrological perspectives on the human soul are inherently antagonistic (and show themselves to be such when assessing the meaning and imapct of the same events of a human life) THE BOOK OF PLUTO will provide you with the synthesis you need to appreciate--and be healed-by both.<br />This book is easy to read, and very valuable.  I did not find it antagonistic to religion either. I advise people to read his work in tandem with your own astrological chart, and the work of psychologist Alice Miller, to free yourself in ways you did not know you could be freed.hes you as much about yourself as it does the methods, overarching purpose and intrinsic, trans-cultural social value of this often maligned, millenia-old science/art form.

A person--as dozens have shown already--can say absolutely nothing relevant about the content of the book (except for that magical word \\"drivel\\"), remind the Black people reading the reviews that Martin Bernal is white--as if he is the ironic, unrealized Great White Hope of Black pseudo-intellectuals in the ghetto; accuse BERNAL of being a racist with an egocentric agenda afterwards...and then end the review in literally twenty to thirty words. Funny how so many people are talking about Afrocentrism, political correctness and the psyche of the urban poor to avoid even mentioning the linguistical structure of the ancient Greek language and its presence of otherwise unintelligible Afro-Asiatic and Semitic words, or the structure of ancient Greek religion and the seamlessness with which it parallels Egypt's that points inexorably to the lucidity of Bernal's theories-anything but the content of the book itself.<br />(The name of the Goddess *Athena*, by the way, is derived from the Egyptian Goddess *Neith*, a later incarnation of Isis. Any traditional Egyptologist will tell you this; this is old news. It isn't the BLACK part of the book's title that creates the real controversy.)<br />Funny, how the detractors of BLACK ATHENA sound more and more like those who were offended by Galileo as time goes by...and Newton...and Darwin...and Einstein...<br />Bernal with BLACK ATHENA separates European Egyptological and Classical thought as it has been practiced and taught in European/American scholarship from the Middle Ages to today into two basic chronological/philosophical subsets: the Ancient Model and the Aryan Model. He shows the latter, the Aryan Model, to be essentially a devolved version of the former, having had its advent in the mid to late 19th century and coinciding with the unprecedented imperialism of modern Europe regarding colonialism in Africa, India and the Middle East.  (Look at the back of the dollar bill to remember the earlier model's influence.) Through this shift in historical perception to Greece over Egypt for otherwise illogical reasons, he reveals a new sociology of knowledge in 19th century European thought not so coincidentally justifying the anti-Semitism and racist/eugenics theories of Social Darwinism-and the public and international policies that followed. In other words, Bernal reveals the degree to which 19th century European myth is at the core of what we have been led to believe is pure, scientific Classicism.<br />This book, with all its faults, forces you to look at Western Greek and Ancient Near East scholarship the same way you would look at the stories of the Old Testament via the eyes of Joseph Campbell instead of a theologian-and then be uncomfortably left alone to deal with the implications. Bernal blueprints the structure of the sociology of knowledge hidden in Classicism-a clique structure no one before him in the traditional fields would ever admit was there.  Why else would people, after *fifteen years* (ATHENA's first printing was in 1987) STILL be unable to stop talking about it irrationally?<br />An unavoidably important book.ck of the dollar bill to remember the earlier model's influence.)

It does not adress itself to the role or the activities, real or imagined, of Freemasonry in contemporary society; it does not attempt to investigate allegations of conspiracy or corruption.  Neither, of course, is it an apology for Freemasonry.  We are not Freemasons ourselves, and we have no vested interest in exculpating the institution from the charges leveled against it.  Our orientation has been wholly historical.  We have endeavored to track down the antecedents of Freemasonry, to establish its true origins, to chart its evolution and development, to assess its influence on British and American culture during its own formative years...<br />&quot;...At the same time, it must be acknowledged that Freemasonry itself has done little to improve its own image in the public eye.  Indeed, by its obsessive secrecy and its stubborn defensiveness, it has only reinforced the conviction that it has something to hide.  How little it does in fact have to hide will become apparent in the course of this book.  If anything, it has more to be proud of than it does to conceal.&quot;<br />Introduction, THE TEMPLE AND THE LODGE; Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh<br />I haven't read Baigent and Leigh most famous book, HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL, which put them on the map with alternative historical perspectives regarding religion, secrecy and culture, but now I want to.  This book, THE TEMPLE AND THE LODGE, makes clear in its erudition and almost ideally objective/journalistic approach that, unlike the general statement made by the writer of the book HOW THE IRISH SAVED CIVILIZATION, a select few men who formed an ancient society centuries ago that evolved and metamorphose into what we now know as Freemasonry have both developed and cultivated their organization into being the spine of Western Civilization after Christ itself.  It is magnificent in that their approach is so historically innovative and nearly all-encompassing, in regards to the cultural scene of the time periods in question, and its strange bedfellows/dance with Catholicism and Protestantism over several hundred years.  It is embarrassing to think that the average educated person can rip off a dozen or so names of great historical figures in many disciplines who were either Masons  or a part of a similiar and related organization (Isaac Newton, George Washington, Ben Franklin, Claude Debussy, Duke Ellington to name a very small few), and yet we do not even consider what the ramifications of such a fact are to our view of history and culture.  And, how culture itself as we know it was actually shaped--regardless of what we were told.<br />The section on the American Revolutionary War, elucidated in such a way as to make clear it was 18th Century England's Vietnam and a hotbed of Masonic activity simultaneously (if not definitively), makes it worth the price of admission all by itself.  But the significance, grandeur and antiquity they lend to our perception of the Masons via the connection with the mythical Nights Templar in Scotland after the 12th century is something that must be read to be fully appreciated.<br />An excellent and important work of history and culture that quietly revels in what it reveals.

I am still having a hard time with this book, because he reifies and affirms so many of my most cherished intuitions regarding spirituality via using the highest brand of intellectuallisms one can probably hope to use in today's world--AND VICE VERSA.<br />I would recommend anyone who finds the majesty of today's world and its endeavors to bridge the gap between science and spirituality fascinating to read first the work of his would be disciples: Michael Talbot (the Holographic Universe) and Jenny Wade (Changes of Mind).  They will prepare both your mind and heart for what Bohm elucidates in this book, the central one of his life, thought and career.<br />Nonetheless, this book effectively bridges the gap, and becomes in may ways the blue print by which the highest level of consciousness and perspective achievable in the context of Western Society today will be henceforth embraced and appreciated.  Bohm was one of the most important thinkers in Western culture, not just our time or the last century.  And this incredible challange of a work of his may not take you half as long to fully digest as it is taking me, but it will open your eyes in ways that you would not expect about possibility, mind, matter, energy, thought, order and existence in the universe. The yogis and the Memphite priests of ancient Egypt were right: here is the proof by the highest science.	2001-07-22

For those of us who can't help but hear Narcississtic baby boomers in mid-life crisis playing jams from the Doors and the Beatles on out of tune guitars and talking about Woodstock whenever you hear the word &quot;Karma&quot; (and therefore would rather not hear anyone try to explain what it is) this book brings you back to the dignity and profundity of what it realy means--not to mention how important it was that the Baby Boomers embraced it when they did for generations after them!<br />Not only will you have no question as to what the central tenets of Hinduism and Buddhism refer to and build from after reading this, you will have a better understanding of what it is to be fully, truly human than practically most of the Western religious text we have today is capable of rendering, as well as the philosophy--which is ironcially based on much of this!  This book sheds a light on life that is so bright it embraces the light of all others and absorbs it into its own, instead of attempting to extinguish it.  It will answer more questions than you even knew you had.  It will also put much of everything from the spiritual self-help/New Age/psychological movement of today's culture to the quantum physics/cutting edge philosophy movement of Western society today into the overarching context we all have been intuitively desperate for.<br />This book teaches your soul to dance.	2001-07-22

One reason is that the ending is simply trite compared to the rest of the book in my opinion.  Another is that it may not have been able to end in a way that would have pleased me no matter how it ended.  But yet another, and perhaps the most important: I was enjoying it, and ending the book meant that the journey I also took with the characters came to an end, like a good party.  This book rates three and a half stars for me, but closer to a full four than three.<br />I found this book by chance at a discount book store in the mid west and truly enjoyed it for one overarching reason: few times have I read a book by an author who made one profound gift so palpable in his creation of despair driven characters.  And that gift of craft is simple: Robert Stone has a beautiful way of displaying, without judgement, the near transcendental lucidity that exists in madness. At so many times you knew exactly what his characters were going to do, but you knew it the same way you knew the plot of THE GODFATHER before you popped it in the VCR for the upteenth time.  It was the dance of his characters in the context of their love affair with everything damaging within the world and themselves; their multi-layered wheel-within-a-wheel dance of insanity on top of artistry on top of genius on top of lonliness on top of despair, on top of anger, on top of rage, on top of beauty, on top of addiction, and codependency, on top of modern and Hollywood society, on top of true love, ON TOP OF INSANITY...  At its lowest moments, the book is a soap opera with an ending seemingly designed to be followed by commercials.  At its highest moments however, the book is a spellbinding maze that I would gladly walk through again, as knowing where it begins and where it ends has no bearing on the journey on which it takes you in between.<br />Defintiely a good weekend summer read..	2001-07-22

We can read all of the New Age literature so popular today in one or more of three contexts: the socio-economic, the neo-psychological reaction to technology and the information society, and one powerful other.  That third one is simple: the unifying belief of every author, regrdless of specific message of the book, is that we are witnessing the dawning of a future world where all our existential questions of spirituality, communication and the multi-discplinary sciences meld into one unified linguistical system of an answer.  Alan Alford reveals, perhaps unlike anyone since the 1830's supreme mindblower ANACALYPSIS by Godfrey Higgins, the psychological, cultural, anthropological, intellectual, scientific and spiritual reasons for the optimism and enthusiasm such an idea inevitably produces in the human heart.  He reveals that that grand idea, generating such spiritual hopes for the future is the mental architecture and language upon which the past 6000-plus years of human civilization is already based.<br />In his second book, THE PHOENIX SOLUTION, Alford took a radical approach to the decoding of Egyptian religion and mythology to reveal its scientific underpinnings unlike anyone before him.  He all but repudiated his first book, intellectually pitting him against both the intelligentsia of modern Egyptology and the ancient astronaut theorists who so influenced him simultaneously.  He said in THE PHOENIX SOLUTION that the foundation of Egyptological thought and religion lay in their scientific theory of the evolutionary growth process of our entire solar system.  Much of the foundational myths, Gods and Goddesses, he showed, symbolize the theorized outer planets of eons past, and their process of raining meteoric bits of proto-life onto our Earth; effectively &quot;seeding&quot; our planet with the beginnings of new life unlike ever before.  This foundational universe-view, not just world view, generated the entire religious philosophy, scientific study, cultural practices and art (from the agriculture to the architecture to the family to the royal political structure)of the culture for more than three thousand years.  It was shared only amongst the highest initiates of the religious sub-culture/ruling elite. The myths told to the common people, encapsulating this principle within mythic/poetic stories, were therefore commonly intellectually and emotionally misinterpreted as actual human events.  But perhaps because of the misconception they continued to be told, for the benefit of the elite and the maintenance of the culture through the practices it kept current, relevant and alive.<br />WHEN THE GODS CAME DOWN is Alan Alford's masterpiece.  He shows in the most remarkable scientific, archaeological and literary fashion how this foundational concept of the evolution of our entire solar system is the generating principle behind not just Egyptian religion but ALL ancient myth and religion; from Sumer to Babylon to Memphis to Jerusalem to Athens.  He then goes to show how the great teachers of every age, like Socrates, Plato,  and Jesus, were lauded as such because they knew, mastered and shared this foundational concept of truth in the context of its cultural, linguistic and psycho-mythic implications--though they still did it in such a way that only the most knowledgeable and initiated would fully appreciate it.  In short, Alford reveals the one sublime, ancient religion UNDERNEATH the many modern world religions as we have come to know them, in their &quot;dumbed down&quot; form; from Christian fundamentalism to Ancient Astronaut/Extraterrestrial fundamentalism.  In so doing, he reaffirms the majesty and human truth within them all. He also simultaneously obliterates the relevance of a divisive literal/fundamentalist interpretation of any of their literature, theology or perspectives.<br />His first book, though it is still lauded by many who continue to hold on to an ancient &quot;Chariots of the Gods&quot; astronaut theory like a fundamentalist orthodoxy, is the evidence of a man lighting a candle in a dark cave. In it he is just beginning to get a clue of the actual nature of reality.  (After undergoing the intellectual crisis that lead to the paradigm shift of his following book, he expected to lose many of his newly made fans; and he has.) As such, the PHOENIX SOLUTION, his second book, represents the beginning of his coming out of that cave.  He leaves the other cave dwellers and all their cults and steps into the light of the outer world, as with it he reaffirms the inherent meaning of the metaphor and allegory within the literal inacuracies of his theories.<br />WHEN THE GODS CAME DOWN is Alan Alford's full basking in the dawning sunlight of knowledge, and his invitation for our Post-Modern and often backward world to come out with him.  Alford shows how the 20th and 21st century is still playing catch up to the ancients in so many ways, philosophically and in some important ways scientifically speaking. Ancient Man it seems was doing Pythagoras, Euclid, Copernicus, Galileo, Darwin, Freud, Jung, Levi-Strauss, Chomsky and perhaps even Einstein millenia before any of them--all as a part of a culture we cling to the remnants of as our own, but have yet to fully understand.<br />My test for the far reaching influence and power of any theorist--particularly of the wannabe revolutionary kind--is three-fold.  One, their theory must be completely plausible; i.e. not needing simple revolt from detractors and complimentary but poorly explained aspects of ITSELF to proclaim and rationalize its essential relevance.  Two, it must have the ability to completely encapsulate the foundational principles, concepts and findings of the other competitive theories as a part of its own. It must be able to explain the essences of the other traditional, historical and competitive theories as simply cogs in the wheel of the grand unifying theme that is the one they propose.  And third, perhaps most important of all, it has to excite me.  There may be things my mind will not be strong enough, educated enough, mutil-lingual enough or quick enough to pick up, but you cannot fool my heart.<br />WHEN THE GODS CAME DOWN does this on all counts.  In light of everything from Bauval, Hancock, and West, to deSantillana, von Dechend and Thompkins, to Martin Bernal, to Michael Rice, straight back to Breasted and Budge, Massey and deLubicz, duPuis and Frankfort, and all of the French and German schools of Egypt-and Assyriology... Alford has seemingly united their perspectives under one foundational principle that is seemingly the key to understanding all of the ancient and most of the modern spiritual world.  It is comparable to the theories of many of the others I have named.  However, in its ability to make them all a part of his theoretical framework as he explains their paradigmatic shortcomings--and excite you while doing so--it far surpasses them.<br />This book answers more questions than it raises.  Try reading it, and looking at anything regarding culture, religion, the spirit and scientific news the same.  I cannot recommend it enough.NEATH the many modern world religions as we have come to know them, in their &quot;dumbed down&quot; form; from Christian fundamentalism to Ancient Astronaut/Extraterrestrial fundamentalism.  In so doing, he reaffirms the majesty and human truth within them all. He also simultaneously obliterates the relevance of a divisive literal/fundamentalist interpretation of any of their literature, theology or perspectives.<br />His first book, though it is still lauded by many who continue to hold on to an ancient &quot;Chariots of the Gods&quot; astronaut theory like a fundamentalist orthodoxy, is the evidence of a man lighting a candle in a dark cave. In it he is just beginning to get a clue of the actual nature of reality.  (After undergoing the intellectual crisis that lead to the paradigm shift of his following book, he expected to lose many of his newly made fans; and he has.) As such, the PHOENIX SOLUTION, his second book, represents the beginning of his coming out of that cave.   He leaves the other cave dwellers and all their cults and steps into the light of the outer world, as with it he reaffirms the inherent meaning of the metaphor and allegory within the literal inacuracies of his theories.  <br />WHEN THE GODS CAME DOWN is Alan Alford's full basking in the dawning sunlight of knowledge, and his invitation for our Post-Modern and often backward world to come out with him.  Alford shows how the 20th and 21st century is still playing catch up to the ancients in so many ways, philosophically and in some important ways scientifically speaking. Ancient Man it seems was doing Pythagoras, Euclid, Copernicus, Galileo, Darwin, Freud, Jung, Levi-Strauss, Chomsky and perhaps even Einstein millenia before any of them--all as a part of a culture we cling to the remnants of as our own, but have yet to fully understand.<br />My test for the far reaching influence and power of any theorist--particularly of the wannabe revolutionary kind--is three-fold.  One, their theory mustbe completely plausible; i.e. not needing simple revolt from detractors and complimentary but poorly explained aspects of ITSELF to proclaim and rationalize its essential relevance.   Two, it must have the ability to completely encapsulate the foundational principles, concepts and findings of the other competitive theories as a part of its own. It must be able to explain the essences of the other traditional, historical and competitive theories as simply cogs in the wheel of the grand unifying theme that is the one they propose.  And third, perhaps most important of all, it has to excite me.  There may be things my mind will not be strong enough, educated enough, mutil-lingual enough or quick enough to pick up, but you cannot fool my heart.<br />WHEN THE GODS CAME DOWN does this on all counts.  In light of everything from Bauval, Hancock, and West, to deSantillana, von Dechend and Thompkins, to Martin Bernal, to Michael Rice, straight back to Breasted and Budge, Massey and deLubicz, duPuis and Frankfort, and all of the French and German schools of Egypt-and Assyriology... Alford has seemingly united their perspectives under one foundational principle that is seemingly the key to understanding all of the ancient and most of the modern spiritual world.  It is comparable to the theories of many of the others I have named.    However, in its ability to make them all a part of his theoretical framework as he explains their paradigmatic shortcomings--and excite you while doing so--it far surpasses them.<br />This book answers more questions than it raises.  Try reading it, and looking at anything regarding culture, religion, the spirit and scientific news the same.  I cannot recommend it enough.	2000-12-15
US	50366777	R4ZQFRBMYG3FC	1560009624	734658818	The Imperial Animal	Books	5	36	41	N	N	One of the millestones of human consciousness	It has been said that Copernicus' treatises on the actual heliocentric nature of the solar system were written more for the friends of his on his unique level of understanding and education.  They were more or less accidentally leaked to the Catholic Church years later; hence the unexpected nature of their reaction.  The historian of science Giorgio de Santillana wrote in THE CRIME OF GALILEO that it was the European academic community (owing its legitimacy to proving inaccurate Aristotlian interpretations of astronomy to be correct) and not the Catholic Church, that gave Galileo the most resistance.  And it was they who were instrumental in politically influencing the Church itself in its damnation of his theories.  Darwin's book ORIGIN OF SPECIES was said to have been scoffed at before all but disappearing... before becoming the focal point of the intellectual wars in Europe and America in the latter half of the 19th century.  And Einstein was a postal clerk for years before his theory of relativity was taken seriously.<br />All of this, combined with Schoepenhauer's theory about the three stages of an emerging truth (first it is ignored, second, it is violently opposed, third, it is accepted as self evident), serve to me as explanation as to why this book, THE IMPERIAL ANIMAL by Tiger and Fox, was not only met with disdain by a number of sociologists and cultural anthropologists upon publication, but has never been previously reviewed on AMAZON.COM and is not referred to among psychoanalytical or sociopolitical minded intellectuals or even everyday people and the Media during the course of any given day.  And yet, in much the same way Freud and Jung made words like &quot;ego&quot;, &quot;unconscious&quot;, &quot;introvert&quot;, and &quot;sibling rivalry&quot; a part of the everyday language of people who say they don't even believe in the social relevance of psychology, this one book is responsible for us looking at the prehistoric world of man and thinking, now with a flipness that makes references both colloquial and unconsious, that it has something to teach us about who we are in the here and now.<br />This book is considered a classic amongst anthropologists and  the equivalent of the life-altering books and theories I've mentioned above to Evolutionary psychologists.  It may be singlehandedly responsible for people using anaolgies of prehistoric times to explain the inclinations and dilemmas of modern man, in all aspects.  Listen to the writers themselves as they talk about the climate in which they wrote this book thirty years ago in the introduction wriiten in 1998:<br />&quot;We could mention several areas in which our scorned ideas of 1971 have become commonplaces of today's academic and public dialogue.  Tiger's term 'male bonding' seems to have passed into the language much as 'inferiority complex' did... It heartens us, for instance, that on opening almost any serious health book today we come across passages like this: 'Even if we are not 100 percent sure that a high fiber diet helps prevent most of the diseases listed, common sense directs us to eat in a manner more closely resembling that of our ancestors, who were rarely bothered by these problems (William Manahan, M.D., &quot;Eat For Health&quot;, 1988).'...This splendid advice is attributed to 'common sense'.  All we can say is that today's common sense is yesterday's ridiculous theories.&quot;<br />Tiger and Fox as sociobiological thinkers make clear that an overwhelmingly significant portion of all interpersonal and cultural human behavior stems from biological imperatives.  We are, as the end result of our biology, destined to have a language of behavioral traits established in us that create much of what is called culture.  And though it definitively is not created by culture, it actually is the biggest impact ON culture in all its permutations throughout time and around the world.  It is what they call the &quot;biogrammar&quot; of human kind.  It is borne via the million or so years of evolution that brought us to a refined state of hunter-based society in the jungle savannahs around the world, and then combined with the alterations of and additions to that paradigm with the birth of agricultural society- which lead to civlization as we know it.<br />The book is profoundly humbling and disheartening.  It attacks and obliterates the cultural hubris regarding the uniqueness of mankind that you would not know exists as the foundation of your psyche until they reveal it, regardless of your philosophical or theological views.  Even the enlightened evolutionary/biochemical view that turns out to be a contradiction in the minds of most laypeople like me- that we share most of the same genetic material with apes and other primates but none of the behavioral implications of that scientific fact- is blown apart in just a look at the essential nature of all political systems:<br />&quot;These are some of the features of baboon and macque social structure... whatever the details of the system, certain underlying processes are obvious despite the diversity of surface structures, and can be easily summarized.<br />  -the system is based on hierarchy and competiton for status...<br />  -the males dominate the political system, and the older males dominate the younger.<br />  -females can be influential in sending males up the status ladder, and their long term relationships to one another are critical for the stability of the system...<br />  -cooperation among males is essential; coalitions of bonded males act as units in the dominance system.<br />  -the whole structure is held together by the attractiveness of the dominants and the attention that is constantly paid them.<br />  -Because of this, charismatic individuals can upset the the hierarchical structure, and by the same token, retain power.&quot;<br />What they show to be the aspects of the basic social environment of the baboon, are also, *at the very least*, the running themes of the past several centuries of western history.<br />Using superlatives to describe this book is pointless.  Its impact and influence speaks for itself- in fact our culture as it is today speaks for it.  It has the power to shake the foundations of your faith in absolutely everything, which cannot be put into words.  But with this idea of the &quot;biogram&quot; and the biogrammatical language of humankind being a fact to be worked with, the way aviators work with the fact of gravity or Oscar Petrson works with the 88 unchangeable keys of the piano...

US	50366777	R17OVH50XYRMI3	0967542405	506072340	Affrilachia: Poems by Frank X Walker	Books	4	7	7	N	N	A reminder of the meaningfulness of the poet's soul	I just recently saw the theatrical version of AFFRILACHIA on the campus of the University of Kentucky (which was truly something else), and had to have a copy of his book immediately afterwards.  Having met and spoken to the author on several occasion, I knew his honesty and warmth would inevitably express itself in collection of his writings.<br />AFFRILACHIA is a love letter to the Black Kentuckian soul.  And yet in it's regional specificity, rhythmic lyricism and illuminating of time, place, events and relationships (as well as their marriage to universal human truths and modern lies) it is a celebration of the African-American creative spirit transcendental as it continues to walk tall, shout hallelujah and dance throughout our country, and much of the world.  Frank X. Walker achieves many sacred paradoxes with the honesty of his craft and style: the more universally he ruminates on the human condition and the grand themes of the late 20th Century African-American experience, the more he unveils the singularity of what it is to be a Black man from Kentucky.  The more he speaks to the personal experiences of his heart and the individual things, people and ideas he truly loves (like, obviously, the prose poetic language itself), the more universal his poetry becomes, and the deeper it resonates in your heart.<br />Being a poet and musician myself born and raised in New York City, I came to his work mired in unconscious stereotype based purely on regional demographics.  (The very prejudice a brother [or anyone] from the big city of big cities would be offended by if he witnessed its expression, experienced it by others, or if you brought it to his attention.) I told myself unawares not to expect the jazz lyricism, introspection, challenging political insight wrapped in rhythmic eternal emotional truths- in other words, all that signifies the triumph of prose over the prosaic- of my classic favorites, heroes and friends in his work.  And then I read &quot;In Hell, Exhale&quot;, and couldn't stop smiling.  I found myself being reminded of the true poet's power to create the space for the paradigm shifts that philosophers, historians and idealogues fill in his potent demand for new perspectives on Dr. Martin Luther King (forshadowing the heart and soul, it seems, of Eric Dyson's monumental new biography) with &quot;Lil Kings&quot;.  I laughed out loud at the celebrated soul of Blackness in the rap artist in &quot;Neopolitan&quot;, as he challenged me to consider that their veracity, as it exists in our time, has the power to &quot;eclipse jazz&quot; the way Bird and Coltrane- and the visual art of Miles Davis in the eighties- in their own way eclipsed the shining stars of their predecessors in their own time.  And the performance of a select number of the gems in this book in the theatrical piece created for its celebration humbled me to the point of knowing that, even in leaving Harlem for the Bluegrass, I found a way to come home.<br />This work is full of honesty, and full of heart.  He teaches as much as he entertains.  He is a fine poet, and this is a fine book of poetry., Exhale&quot;, and couldn't stop smiling.

So many books in the world that people think are incendiary or revolutionary, challenging and rechallenging our conception of free speech, religion, citizenship, science and technology, philosophy, economics and politics or spirituality have an attraction to us because of how they serve as metaphors for the painful realities of our personal lives under the  illusions we create for public consumption, and the secrets of our inner selves we wish to uncover. We yearn to break free of something and embrace some inner truth; we just don't know what, and therefore call it some aspect of the outer world. The desires we have to be and have  more than what we are, the feelings of not knowing who we truly are and never truly being loved- and the root causes of such feelings- are unveiled in this powerful, disturbing, life shifting and life-affirming book.<br />Alice Miller was one of the patron saints of John Bradshaw, the man whose work heralded the age of the Inner Child that became part of the pop-psychology lexicon of the 90's. Her perspective and conclusions, scientifically, sociologically and philosophically speaking, are practically undebateable. And without even needing the true case examples from her therapeutic practice to underscore her points (which she uses with striking and original clarity and precision across gender, racial, ethnic, cultural and socioeconomic lines), her elucidation of her central thesis on the ignored emotional life of children- and the cost of having parents unequipped to give them the love they need- will undoubtedly make deep seated memories of your own childhood come to the surface.<br />Why does society have such automatic and irrational contempt for the egotist?  Why do individulas run to prove themselves (or immediately start thinking of themselves defensively) as the antithesis, upon seeing anyone's character asessed in such a context? Why does even the WORD &quot;self&quot; conjure up confused and uncomfortable feelings when used in anything but a mind-numbing spiritual context with people?  What do children need beyond basic nutritional and socioeconomic concerns, and what happens to them when they grow older but do not get it? How is it possible to have more material things and personal achievements than anyone, and still have less and less confidence in who you are?<br />This book can explain things about your adult life  and relationships that you'd rather not have so easily and individually explained. And those who look to books like these to figure out what's wrong with their friends, lovers and parents will discover more about themselves than they may think  they're ready to process.  We all are not just ready but overdue for these kinds of life lessons.<br />Never has a writer, perhaps before or since, put the words &quot;childhood&quot; and &quot;mourning&quot; together in one thought, such that it can create a complete paradigm shift in how one sees oneself, and sees the opportunities for happiness one's world.<br />The fault levied on any psychologist on her level- and there are very, very few- is that this kind of thinking all but demands the kind of narcisstic modern solipsism she seems to diagnose as symptomatic of the illness. (She refers to the dynamic not as an illness, however, but a &quot;tragedy&quot;; keeping us again, I believe, in tune with the ancient Greek mythic/philosophical reference inherent in the old title for this book, &quot;The Drama of the Gifted Child&quot;.) Such blanket criticism of psychology books in general could only be concluded with one of this quality from a misreading of the text; the kind of misreading that usually comes when she has hit a nerve the likes of which one didn't expect, may be afraid of and couldn't imagine beforehand. Nonetheless, taking our culture's preoccupation with the self into consideration, there is still nothing of lasting value one could do in the world withoutat least endeavoring to answer the existential questions of soul, love, freedom, loss and pain- and the true self- that this book demands you to do in a new way for practically the rest of your life.<br />I gave it four stars instead of five because it was too short. I didn't want it to end. And the idea that she could 1) prove her point, 2)deeply affect me by making me dream dreams that I've never dreamed before, 3)access undramatic but painful memories of childhood events that I forgot happened but have been behind more than half of the seemingly unrelated choices I've made in my adult life, and 4) feel a usually suppressed rage and grief  give way to a new sense of purpose and a release of joyful energy and optimism- all in a little more than a hundred pages- still makes me queasy. In other words, read this as a five and a half star review! Then buy the book, put down the most recent bash on modern politics and the latest neo-spiritual mind candy on the bestseller's list, and begin a real journey.hout at least endeavoring to answer the existential questions of soul, love, freedom, loss and pain- and the true self- that this book demands you to do in a new way for practically the rest of your life. <br />I gave it four stars instead of five because it was too short.

The words carry more weight and bounce to the ounce than any retort on them could hope to muster. The book begins rather slowly for me; you are so aware of the fact that the pieces of this profound chess game to be played are being put on the board in the first couple of chapters that it seems as if the writer, Dr. Yalom of Stanford University, is complimenting himself pedantically on his research. But that is the only thing that could keep this magnificent book from getting five stars from me; once he gets going and Nietzsche and Breuer begin their talks, my world began to open and my heart began to both break and be reinvigorated with fire as my mind was blown and reblown simultaneously. At the beginning you wonder when it's getting started, by the time you reach near the middle... be sure you don't have to be somewhere important, need a good night's sleep or get in a car to start driving- you won't be able to put it down! Nor will you escape from having it deeply, deeply touch you.<br />&quot;I try to teach him that lovers of truth do not fear stormy or dirty water. What we fear is SHALLOW water!&quot;<br />&quot;If you kill God, you must also leave the shelter of the temple...&quot;<br />&quot;A wise Jewish teacher advised his followers to break with their mother and father and to seek perfection. THAT might be a step worthy of a lad of infinite promise. that might have been the right dance to the right tune...&quot;<br />&quot;... you take pride in your meekness. You make a virtue of necessity; you bury your feelings deep, and then, because you experience no resentment, you assume that you are saintlike...&quot;<br />&quot;...he presents himself as good- he does no harm- other than to himself and to nature! I must stop him from being one of those who call themselves good because they have no claws...&quot;<br />&quot;Duty? Can duty take precedence over your love for yourself and your own quest for unconditional freedom? If you have not attained yourself, then 'duty' is merely a euphemism for using others for your own enlargement.&quot;<br />&quot;I dream of a love in which two people share a passion to search together for some higher truth. Perhaps I should not call it love. Perhaps it's real name is friendship.&quot;<br />&quot;Bertha is a cornucopia of mystery, protection, and salvation! Josef Breuer calls this love.

I CHOSE, like the way you choose to enjoy your average Hollywood action movie today, to enjoy it.  Somehow the bad writing, as if it were written by your gifted high-school  student/friend or child, made it that much more endearing, and added a level of natural  authenticity to the feelings (if not all the experiences) meant to be consumed as facts. Particularly well thought out and explicated were his delineating of the nine levels of psycho-spiritual human maturation, as it connects with the energies of the universe, and eventually- as we all will in time- we become them, as the culture of humanity combines all of its present day philosophies, religions and scientific perspectives into one. We will then ascend to the highest point of our evolution and become the energy that is the universe, each according to their level of enlightenment, as the ancient Mayan culture is supposed to have done en masse, according to him.<br />(One of my favorite old Star-Trek episodes, with Kirk and Spock, had them and the Klingons come against a society who had evolutionarily ascended to that same point!  They stopped the Klingon/Human war.  In other words, the ideas have been out there for quite some time, enough to even be used by highly creative science fiction writers for more than forty years, and are always at the very least refreshing and fascinating by nature.)<br />My dearest hope is  that people take a &quot;Celestinian prophetic&quot; approach to the riches of life that we already enjoy after  reading this, and take another look at the classics of art, culture (Western and Eastern) and philosophy (Western and Eastern)  with new eyes- not to mention (dare I say it) the Bible. Today's New-Agers are so quick to claim the  latest re-invention of the wheel backed by a strong publishing house as the Newest Testament,  bringing us out of the ignorance of six millenia  of what we call civilization, that they miss one simple fact: EVERYTHING OLD IS NEW AGAIN.  This can even be missed (and is usually it seems) among the followers of Redfield themselves.<br />I invite all who enjoyed this  book as much as I have- even if it was not in the way I did- to look again at the writings of Spinoza, the inventions and discoveries (and  for God sakes the ancient influences) of Newton, the music of Bach, the archetypes and anima/animus  theories of Jung, THE BOOK OF JOHN- and maybe, oh I dunno, try picking up a book or two by  some radical Egyptologists like Martin Bernal or Dr. Ben-Jochannan or Alan Alford (PYRAMID SOLUTION, BLACK ATHENA, how about Godfrey Higgins, ANACALPYSIS) and see where the Mayan culture  connects with cultures even more ancient. And, where these profound, &quot;revolutionary&quot; thoughts of the  nine insights have been around for several thousand years- and successfully ignored by much of  today's world (that is, until now).<br />Don't put but so much expectation in your life being &quot;changed&quot; by this, and you will get something out of it- maybe even a challenge.claim the                      latest re-invention of the wheel backed by a strong publishing house as the Newest Testament,  bringing us out of the ignorance of six millenia                      of what we call civilization, that they miss one simple fact: EVERYTHING OLD IS NEW AGAIN.

But there is no other way to describe the power of what Dr. Jenny Wade has to say and the intellectual argument she makes- with the erudition of a scientist, and the humility of a mystic.<br />CHANGES OF MIND is the thinking man and woman's CELESTINE PROPHECY.  She not only avoids backing down from the challenge of embracing previously accepted conventional psychoanalytical theory, religious philosophy and the scientific method.  She embraces and redeems them all, as well as the myth and mysticism of practically every age and religion, by puttting them in what can only seem to be their proper intellectual/spiritual perspective.  The model for charting and understanding the levels of consciousness of the human being- animal and spirit/mind- that she proposes becomes so immediately all encompassing that it can be considered a unified field theory for the human experience unlike anything that has been rendered before in Western Society.<br />Many writers, with their amazing intellect and insight, can give honor to their disciplines as they encompass enough of human endeavor and history into their perspective to make you become a intellectual roomate in the apartment of their minds whenever you look at the world afterwards.  Camille Paglia and Nancy Friday, with their Freudian/Nietzschean, Anthropological/Psychological perspectives; Giorgio de Santillana (HAMLET'S MILL), with his profound and innovative (though not new) look at ancient myth in the context of astronomical science, immediately come to mind.  Some, like the genius astrophyiscist Stephen Hawking, open you up to a world you otherwise would not have ever known.<br />CHANGES OF MIND has managed, for me, to create a paradigm of thought that encompasses every other, as if the intellectual house of every other thinker over the past three or four millenia around the world has been layed out to be easily visited and understood in the Urban Planning City-structure of Dr. Jenny Wade's mind.  Gnostic Christianity, Freud, Piaget, Tibetan Mysticism, Sociology, Possibility thinkers, Success-oriented philosophies, New-age Spiritualism, Newtonian Physics, Quantum mechanics, psychic powers, dysfunctional families and codependency, Jung, history, the nature of time and space, reincarnation, pre-natal memories, English literature, sex, Buddhism, Christian Fundamentalism, Jesus Christ... there is little if anything in the human world that cannot be better understood and completely encapsulized by her vision of Transpersonal Psychology and the actual full stages of human development she clearly, lucidly and powerfully describes.<br />There are an extraordinarily few number of books that I have read that have touched me so profoundly, creating a paradigm shift in my view of people, myself and the world,while simultaneously reaffirming my most treasured pre-verbal intuitions- with science, not poetry. She does, however, make the poetry of all the world, from John Donne (&quot;Death too, shall die&quot;) to the Egyptian Book of the Dead, to the New Testament, come alive in ways I never expected, and never would have guessed.<br />I cannot recommend this book to the fascinated and the skeptical alike enough.nker over the past three or four millenia around the world has been layed out to be easily visited and understood in the Urban Planning City-structure of Dr. Jenny Wade's mind.

Much as John Bradshaw's &quot;Inner Child&quot; work in the early '90's created a shift in our understanding of the human heart, Nancy Friday's work in this particular book, predating his by almost two decades, leads the way to conscious living in today's society- and crying real cleansing tears- unlike anything I've read.  Underneath the poetry that is recited in most New-Age philosophical literature today, from Marianne Williamson to Iyanla Vanzant- particularly that which is written by women- seems to be this unvoiced feeling of existential anxiety that sits like a pink polka-dotted elephant with wings on top of the refrigerator of their minds. They try to keep their ideas pure, fresh, and, though attempting to portray them as warm, they come off often surprisingly cold- particularly when speaking about men, marriage, family and male/female relationships.  I am often left feeling as if I've been laughed at or dismissed underneath being taught a new way to pray in their books, because that secret anxiety has been successfully transferred to me, the ignorant &quot;neophyte&quot; of their modern spiritual age.  Nancy Friday not only dares- and dares us- to look at that pink elephant of anxiety and listen to its screaming truth with courage with this book, SHE GIVES US AN ANATOMY LESSON ON IT.<br />And perhaps that is the magic of it.  Talk is often rendered so cheap in most of the self-help literature specifcally by its childlike dwelling on the concept &quot;fear&quot; as if it were the one-dimensional devil from Medieval Christianity decaffinated by modern secular society. I come away from much of their work quietly confused by the ironically mildly frightening context of it being something- once recognized- immediately vanquished in all areas of life simply by thinking spiritually; knowing that everyone from Olympic athletes to worldclass entertainers and performers to happily married people after ten years must have something more than that to go on to be what they are.  The spiritual books sell of course, but the tonic doesn't last more often than not and our personal anxiety returns, because such an easily marketable approach often exacerbates the very issues detailed in MY MOTHER, MY SELF via trivializing their alternately undistinguished and ignored destructive power.<br />MY MOTHER, MY SELF is the kind of book that creates the paradigm shift everyone searches for in figuring out the pain of their broken relationships, and the embarrasing patterns that engender them, underneath the &quot;isms&quot; of society that we normally run to to explain them.  Nancy could have stopped with redeeming the power of everything you thought you knew about Freud, his disciples and their work on the mother/child relationship, but she goes far beyond that. This is the kind of book that lets you see what could be stopping you in every area of life, from sex to career, from living to the fullest of your capabilities.  This is the kind of book that stops treating fear, (particularly &quot;I'm afraid of my own power [*ohmm*]&quot;) as a mantra we simply need to stop saying in our heads, and gives us a schematic diagram of it's architecture to see how we are LIVING in it.  (We simply and so often just move from room to room- sex to relationships to career to family to friends to competitions to politics to money to &quot;spirit&quot;, back to family and to relationships- because the full recognition of where we are living emotionally and existentially is still not as damaging or painful to our minds as the realization of it's consequences beyond a given compartmentalized area of our lives.) In so doing- letting us see fear is a house in which we've living and operating from, a house with a name- we see through her work how we have been living and treating others in most of our lives, and how simply it explains so many otherwise made-mysterious things that cause us such unhappiness and lackof personal fulfillment.<br />It obviously looks like it was written purely for women.  But it really isn't.  Especially because in today's society (some twenty years after its first printing), many identity and sex roles are being reversed even moreso among women and men.  But also becuase many men, like myself, have been raised in a single female parent household in such a way as to have the selfsame psychological issues women have. Because of the difference in expectations of our gender, we are just treated with an open contempt for their unconscious expression, instead of the sublimated pity with which we in the world habitually treat women.  It also enables men to see what does often detroy our relationships, particularly when, after the true committment has been established in our hearts and openly shown to the world, the Dr. Jeckyll we've fallen in love with turns into the Mrs. Hyde we never saw before- or thought we left at her mother's house.<br />As an instinctive lover of irony, it is never lost on me that as a man, the most soul-freeing book I've read in quite some time were written especially for women.  (So was the last one [Friday's JEALOUSY])! But despite the small drawbacks in it being dated, thereby not showing the many new female heroines of today, I can assure any woman and man reading this that you will not be able to look at relationship issues and today's world the same afterwards.k of personal fulfillment.  <br />It obviously looks like it was written purely for women.

US	50366777	R1KKQQQXIIQI38	0825671523	151306071	American Aria: From Farm Boy to Opera Star	Books	3	6	7	N	N	Straightforward, non-operatic look at an operatic life	As a bass-baritone singer, I came to this book wanting to learn from it as much as I have learned from his Met performances and Master classes at Juilliard.  And the book does not let you down in that regard at all.  In many ways it can be seen being even more exclusive in its readership solicitation than one would expect; written for the professional singer even more than just the opera buff.  The anecdotes and informative stories about the perils and joys of a career on the rise, the things a singer must know but can't learn in the studio, the sacrifices made for a lasting art, the joy of being in a safe, supportive place to learn your craft, and of course the funny stories about the legends of the business, keep you turning the page.<br />Unfortunately there are times where I felt as if I am reading a story so specifically designed to highlight certain areas of his life- or to put his life in its entirety in a narrow, safe-for-discussion context- that he wrote it with the same preconceptions of a professor writing a college textbook.  It's as if he made a point of not making it literary or dramatically potent to prove a point and to be honest when, as an opera singer, he knows that more often than not in drama is where the real spiritual truths are.  At first I figured it is simply his personality to be so deadpan in print when I read some of what he glossed over like a journalist writing headlines, combined with having no intention of being a professional writer of novels or anything else; just wanting to tell his story.  But so many fascinating and illuminating events in his life- and the corresponding psychology of the man that had to produce most of them- were summed up in sentences and paragraphs, where they could have and probably should have bloomed into pages and chapters.  Again, as a singer I couldn't stop reading about his perception of various operatic roles and his performances of them, and how events in his life were put to use by him in them. But as a man, who has had failed relationships before for reasons both related and unrelated to being a performing artist, he had to tell me more than he just grew apart from both of his wives over time to keep me interested. (I have to admit though, the story of his young son seeing him do an ELIJAH with symphony orchestra soon after he and his wife's divorce, and the child, overwhelmed with pride, love and grief over his absence yelled to him, &quot;Why won't you come home?&quot;, broke my heart.)  In other words, one of the overarching themes of the book, along with his love of music, his love of women that is not out of control but is almost as powerful, and the obvious subtitle of his rise out of the farm to the houses of Paris, La Scala, Covent Garden, Vienna, and of course the Met, is one that seems to be unstated but equally there.  And that for me was unsettling: his unwillingness in life still to subject himself completely to the revealing of the actual architecture of his soul, in both its beauty and ugliness, to gain a greater wisdom and understanding of who he has been and still, with the same voice he had in 1975 or not, singularly is.  To some degree he hides his truest self behind the music and career that has revealed him.  God only knows what roles he took early on in his career and the perofmance and rehearsal habits that over many years could have built up and contributed to his unexpected vocal trauma in the eighties.  We'll never know.  God only knows what kind of husband he must have been during the traumatic times he talks about, and during his rise to success beforehand, and if there were any affairs with any of the many great sopranos and mezzos he has workes with.  We'll really- unless his ex-wives, God help us, decide to write tell-all books- never know.  And God only knows what other personalities within each of his wives he had to contend with before the divorces, as very often women without a recognizable talent that their families would support (or the world would forgive their strange issues for) are attracted to men with similiar issues but an unkillable talent and spirit to match, and find themselves overtaken with envy instead of  unconditional love when the honeymoon is over.  God only knows which of all his many operatic roles performed he secretly relates to the most.  The effect the above forces alone can have on an artist's self-expression, and his emotional/spiritual/professional life, is the stuff of legend.  And regardless of what National Enquirer thinking may lead us to believe about their validity, they are extremely important parts of an artist's life story, if it is to be told.  He in large part left them out, in such a way as to say to me that they and their implications are known by him implicitly, but left out purposely.<br />Sherrill I'm sure tried his best to keep it from sounding like a tell-all, Hollywood dish-the-dirt biography that wouldn't be worth a damn.  AMERICAN ARIA doesn't devolve into that at any time, as far as I'm concerned.  But he took too much of his Verdian baritone personality out of it, and played it too safe when speaking of his personal emotional issues the difficult and unexpectedly joyous moments in his development and professional life, and the dramas they- as they do to all of us- made out of his existence.  And of course, how he overcame them all to create, WITH them (and his craftsmanship), as opposed to vice versa, the superstardom and honorable life he has lived...support (or the world would forgive their strange issues for) are attracted to men with similiar issues but an unkillable talent and spirit to match, and find themselves overtaken with envy instead of  unconditional love when the honeymoon is over.

US	50366777	RKD4EJAM1QJWS	0452260116	312810069	Song of Solomon	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Unparalleled lyricism, a Black symphony of the human soul	This is my third of Toni Morrison's novels (SULA and JAZZ are both  magnificent; I will dive into PARADISE probably next), and I can honestly  say that I can't imagine anything surpassing it on any number of levels in  print.  I never thought I would experience a novel whose scope, power,  subject matter, ruminations on the art and consequences of being human and  evident mastery of style could ever come close to Ellison's INVISIBLE MAN;  Morrison has done it in SONG OF SOLOMON.  She has in fact equalled it, if  not surpassed it.<br />Toni Morrison's way of creating this infinitely and  immaculately detailed tableau of multi-dimensional characters in a number  of multi-dimensional communities is already legendary. (I am almost afraid  to think it may have been surpassed in later novels.)  Yet with SONG OF  SOLOMON it all gravitates sublimely around what for me is the central theme  of the book, made evident by the drama of its protagonist, the young  &quot;Macon Dead&quot;, and his affair with a troubled woman and his  secretive family.  The theme is so powerful that one cannot hear it set to  her lyricism without it breaking your heart: without a  psycho-mythic/spiritual connection with one's roots- one's ancestors and  ancestral stories- and the otherwise inexplicable and incomparable courage  in the individual heart that only comes from it, it is altogether  impossible to experience, give or submit to uncondidtional love.  All of  the characters express this fundamental truth in ways that are shocking,  amusing, appalling, enlightening, saddening, frightening, and ennobling-  often simultaneously.  Toni successfully, perhaps unlike any writer before  her, connects the knowledge and embracing of one's ancestral past with the  self-knowledge of the architecture of one's individual soul, and the glory  of human love, in such a way as to prove the three are synonymous.  Thus  without one, the others cannot by definition truly exist.  Such a message  in today's times could only be told by Toni, whose craft as a writer has  transcended mastery.<br />I don't ever remember being so moved by a novel.  When I was done, I knew myself better than I ever thought I could... and I  wanted to fly.<br />&quot;If I'd knowed more, I would have loved more.&quot;  Toni Morrison,  SONG OF SOLOMON<br />This book is a gift unlike any  other.s could only be told by Toni, whose craft as a writer has  transcended mastery.<br />I don't ever remember being so moved by a novel.

This book is filled with  all the elements of masterful storytelling, mythic-level subtext and  spellbinding events, psychological depth, multi-dimensional characters and  characterizations... it will be patently impossible for you to put it down  once you have picked it up.  I somehow found a way to avoid this book in  high school and college- partly, I'm sure, because it became so fashionable  to have a timely opinion on its social relevance that it made not having  read it seem subhuman, while simultaneously making the act of reading it  seem like an inhumanly boring chore.  Thank God the spirit of excellence  and truth kept calling me to this book.  This one book does for the human  soul what the authors of most of the last ten plus years of self-help  books, sociological tomes, racial dialogues and popular novels COMBINED  have both endeavored to do and practically proclaim could not actually be  done in print.  I came away from this book feeling rejuvenated, stunned,  inspired, engaged, taught, challenged, exhilarated, simultaneously filled  with both hope and despair- and never at any time did I stop feeling  entertained. I not only felt what the character went through, but the sick  side of humanity and how it fought the good in every human being he came  across, in an insane, insane world that renders human beings,  &quot;invisible&quot;.<br />Ralph Ellison was from the school of writers who  endeavored not just to write good, timely books but epic myth/epistles of  the human condition wrapped up in the pains, sicknesses and triumphs of the  present day experience. He didn't try to write a Black book; he tried to  write a human book, about the spirit IN a Black man.  He did it.  He  achieved it.

Yet this book is a constnt reminder that it is a lot more than the  strange impulse that makes people look at car wrecks or moths fly into  flames that makes you not just hear him, but listen.<br />This book can be  painful for black people and white liberals alike, but it is a symphony of  illumination and a love letter for every American.  His unveiling of the  (not so) secret architecture of psychology that lies underneath the actions  and arguments of so much of us when caught in the race issue and  experience, is a much needed call to stand up and regain the honor and  integrity that has to a large degree been lost as we all continue to cross  over into the promised land, but lose the spirit that got us there.  I  first read this book several years ago, and it has since become all the  more important, as the changing information society is still making us all  run to old expressions of made up social fears to mask our personal  insecurities.<br />He has never been, nor I believe will he ever be, stupid  enough to believe that racism as an issue has disappeared from the American  landscape.  Nor would he say that it has stopped being a dynamic deeply  affecting if not destroying the opportunities, spirit and lives of many  many people.  in fact, if anything, he is saying that it is there almost as  strong as ever, just in such a complex and hidden form that negative ideas  and problems are prostituting once powerfully positive solutions.<br />This  book is deeply effective and affecting, and would make you think hard about  what Martin really meant when he gave the speech from which its title is  derived.<br />Among countless other things, we owe Martin reading books like  this with an open mind and courageous heart.

Quite possibly I was also lucky enough to not have read his first book, the essential refutation of which has seemed to throw many  for a loop. Coming as someone from an Egyptological and  artistic/ethnological background who knows many of the world renowned  Egyptologists he quotes personally, I can honestly say, as Michael Rice  does in his preface, that this is one of the most important new-perspective  Egyptological works written in at least thirty years. It is capable of  creating its own genre of study and enlightenment across several  disciplines. It is fairly easy to write some New Age mythological mind  candy that declares all kinds of wild things to be a secret reality (I  won't mention any names of authors as cases in point- they know who they  are). It isn't often that a work comes along that challenges the erudition  of the status quo with a mind blowingly believable but frightfully  unorthodox thesis, partly derived thanks to the plethora of scholarly  material ignored by the establishment for more than a century for just such  a reason. This is the kind of book that makes waves; the kind of waves that  some future book will capitalize on and ride like a surfer while this one  is unsuccessfully trashed or frightfully ignored; making the world believe  the truth herein has just been discovered, when it will be only in the  future that it in actuality could be digested by the masses. I only hope  Alford is the one to write that one also. It is hard in retrospect, given  how hard it is to shock us these days in the now 21st Century, to compare  Alford to Galileo and Darwin. Yet given what I know of many of his research  materials, sources and approach- and again, the erudition of his varied  references, along with his phenomenal ideas- it is hard not to.<br />Read it  with an open mind, and learn something incredible- even if in the end, you  don't agree with the plausibility of the final theory.

Each calendar day of the year has a message for dealing with a particular kind of struggle, and accepting a particular kind of gift, inherent in the promise and reality of  every day of life.  I am reminded of a poet friend of mine who made a  point every day of flipping pages with his eyes closed and stopping at one  indiscriminately, treating the book like a kind of *I Ching* ritual, to get  a special unexpected message to start or continue his day.  It also, I'm  sure, inspired much of his poetry.<br />Iyanla Vanzant's appeal I believe- or  part of it- is her ability to do something creative with the knowledge she  has acquired.  In reality it doesn't take much more than reading the top  ten best sellers in New Age philosophy and pop-psychology of the past ten  or so years (sprinkled with a bit of Freud and the New Testament) to  regurgitate in print much of what is said in any of the books that are  popular today.  The talent comes in not how you shine the piano of your new  found consciousness- which everyone actually has and uses intuitevly on  good days- but how you play it.  Vanzant proves unquestionably in this book  that she is an artist with something uniquely powerful to say; uniquely in  that it is particularly individual and artistically authentically rendered,  such that a bit of her soul is left on every page, as well her advice.  And  the quotes she gives of other great thinkers, great artists and just great  people, add to the wonderfullness of it all perfectly, taking ego out of  the game.  This I believe is still her most successful book in that  regard.<br />This book makes a great gift, as many of her books do (some make  better gifts than they do keepers), but it also can easily become a  treasured companion on your daily journey through the year, reminding you  how blessed every day actually is.<br />Highly recommended.	2000-07-24

I knew  intuitively that there was so much more to Christ and Christianity than  what I was taught to blindly accept in church, or was trivialized by New  Age spiritualists.  My intiuition wasn't affirmed until I got this  book.<br />Elaine Pagels brings the art back to the Christian mind, heart and  way of life, by bringing out the texts and philosophies of the early  Christians who didn't &quot;make the cut,&quot; as a Seventh-Day Adventist  friend of mine once said (she hadn't realized nor was taught that they  were, for the most part, assassinated for political reasons).  With them-  the Gnostic Christians- and their ways lost, a disowning of much of the  spiritual self became part and parcel of Christian doctrine, setting itself  up as antagonistic to much of its ancient influences and original  purpose.<br />Elaine Pagels allowd me to finally, comfortably see Christ the  way one would look at an artist like Dizzy Gillespie, in a world where all  the money and power comes from playing three chords in a rock band and  nothing else.  The full beauty and metaphoric power of Christianity is  revealed to have been lost by most, hidden by few, antagonistic to nothing  but the lower forms of thought, feeling, behavior, language and ritual that  Catholicism actually yielded to, in the efforts to establish itself as the  state religion under Constantine and beyond.  The things thast call to  aspects of the mind and soul that are thought to be antagonistic to  Christian doctrine and &quot;pagan&quot; in their implications, actually  form the essence and the specifics of Christ's teaching.  In such, Pagels  shows that the line separating Christianity from paganism, philosophy and  much more ancient religious thought in the modern mind can only be kept in  place via a misreading of the actual scripture, out of full  context.<br />Pagels makes it fundamentally clear just how important the  discovery of the Nag Hammadi Library is to all people, not just Christian  or Christian raised.  She succeeds in creating a bridge, connecting all of  those many subjects and ideas that your heart and soul call to  simultaneously, but cannot seem to get without great sacrifice.  And her  writing style makes it all so clear and easy to understand to anyone that  you will come away very enlightened- and affirmed- on the first  reading.<br />This book will probably become a very important part of the  library of whoever reads it.e ancient religious thought in the modern mind can only be kept in  place via a misreading of the actual scripture, out of full  context.<br />Pagels makes it fundamentally clear just how important the  discovery of the Nag Hammadi Library is to all people, not just Christian  or Christian raised.

But if I can imagine... in such detail, then where does that come from?  Of one thing I am sure- I have a soul, and it knows more than I can presently comprehend with my mind... And  again, the absence of evidence does not mean the evidence of absence.&quot;  (From the final chapter)<br />This is a beautiful book.<br />Shirley Maclaine is  a person and personality who both embodies and transcends most of the  adjectives put on her regarding her career and her spiritual quest- some  humbling, some life-affirming, and some (if I were her) downright insulting  when it comes to the revealing of her soul's journey.  Perhaps it is in  that spirit that such a book, coming from such a learned and powerful  spirit of a woman attaining even greater wisdom and polish in her sixties,  could not help but be a wonderful read.  Maclaine talks about her  pilgrimage through Northern Spain on this famous spiritual path walked by  queens, mystics, warriors and prophets in such a way as to have you  practically walking with her.  She brings so much of the physical reality  of the path to your senses through her writing style, and gives dimensions  of character, emotion and life to the many people she came to know along  the way.<br />The beauty of this book however, is not in actuality how she  seems to walk the fine line between fiction and reality when talking of her  mystical and metaphysical experiences.  (Her biggest fans/erstwhile  disciples AND her most orthodox skeptics and detractors will have a field  day with Lemuria and Atlantis alone.)  She does tell in great and  wonderfully novelistic detail the gradual revelation of how reincarnation  has seemed to assert itself in the shape and rhythm of her life, and drew  her to the Camino in the first place.  She does paint and superimpose  grand visions of the Spain of the ancient Moors and the Crusaders on top of  the modern Spain of the Camino in the mid 1990's with beautiful and vivid  detail.  And the unexpected connections she makes among her many  experiences and people, covering many places- even many lifetimes- propel  the story and your interest as a whole.<br />What makes this book so  enjoyable, however, is Shirley MacLaine's heart.  MacLaine gives you the  feeling that this entire book is a chapter in her diary, where there is no  need to lie or impress anyone but the spirit of truth that inspires one to  write.  And then she makes you feel as if you are her best friend, and  trust you enough to share the secrets of her soul.  If the jury is still  out for you on many of the spiritual concepts she all but took for granted  before starting this journey, you will without a doubt feel, at times,  virtually overwhelmed by her dream state visions.  You will wonder at times  who she thinks she is kidding.  You will feel as if you will become  exhausted by the degree of disbelief she asks you to suspend in following  her through a looking glass unlike any you may have ever heard, real or  fictional.  But you probably won't throw up your hands and put the book  down, because of the purity and innocence with which she delivers what is  immediately picked up as the treasured experiences of her soul.  At times  while reading, I felt as if I were listening to the imagination of a gifted  child.  At other times I felt as if I were being told a fable by a modern  day Aesop, with something to learn from it all that would enrich me.  At  other times, I felt like I was hearing a blow by blow true story of a  woman's experiences with inspirational events that went misinterpreted.  I  felt all kinds of things while reading, but I never stopped reading,  because I never stopped feeling this sense of outpouring love, giving it a  stamp of truth that needed to not be ignored.  That is what drives this  wonderful, enchanting, even perplexing tale, and has you getting more out  of it than you would expect.<br />My respect and unconditional positive regard  for ShirleyMacLaine has, through this book, grown tremendously beyond my  mind's ability to fully explain why- which is what love is all about isn't  it?<br />You will enjoy this very much.irley MacLaine has, through this book, grown tremendously beyond my  mind's ability to fully explain why- which is what love is all about isn't  it?<br />You will enjoy this very much.	2000-06-27

Camile  Paglia's SEXUAL PERSONAE, heavily indebted to this and the major works of  Freud by her own proud admission, is what led me to this pretty staggering  work for its time.  It is relatively easy to make someone's brain hurt  with a lot of scholar talk, where one is saying nothing; this book is great  because it is *sensational*, in the truest sense of the word.  This is one  of the first of the many books about religion and the history of man that  put my stomach up in knots, as it simultaneously gave me the power to look  beyond the fabrication of ancient Greek philosophical society and  Judeo-Christian heritage as the summit of man's knowledge.  (Not that that  was ever a problem for me consciously, but unconsciously I doubt anyone  without reading a book like this has moved beyond it.)  This is one of the  books that made a new approach to the understanding of man and a paradigm  shift as to how we have mentally, emotionally and spiritually developed not  only possible, but inevitable.<br />What could keep this monument from  receiving five stars will be fairly obvious to any reader: the prejudices  of his time.  It is actually hard to look at what he says objectively in  that context; before him I doubt anyone put two and two together to come up  with what he did during a time when his racism and trivialization of  non-Euopean peoples, and for more than the past fifty plus years after him,  anyone who has read his  work has had that tempered by the embarrasing  revalations of Nietsche and Freud.  That, along with the egocentrism of  Victorian Europe that he projects onto ancient and prehistoric man, serves  to keep the book from being perfect (and are  sometimes annoying), but do  not serve to really take away its importance and incredible effect.<br />If  you are a Joseph Cambell fan, you will be powerfully challenged by this  book.  Frazer was not attempting to come up with the same conclusions for  myth and ritual that Campbell, though influenced by him, was.  But you will  love it, and respect it highly because of it.  In a way, where Campbell  seems to say &quot;this is what it all means,&quot; Frazer says &quot;this  is what it all IS,&quot; letting the wonder of unexpected knowledge allow  you to come to your own conclusions.  This book will start you on a great  spiritual journey if you never read anything of its kind before, and this  edition is a very good one to have.to keep the book from being perfect (and are  sometimes annoying), but do  not serve to really take away its importance and incredible effect. <br />If  you are a Joseph Cambell fan, you will be powerfully challenged by this  book.

US	50366777	RRUIXB1A54016	0385418868	26788304	The Power of Myth	Books	4	167	177	N	N	A mind opening book that makes you smile from the heart	Of my two favorite memories of Campbell's talks with Bill Moyers of PBS, which is what this book transcribes and encapsulates, the one that comes to mind is an introduction between Campbell and a Catholic Priest, perhaps a  Cardinal, that he retells.  After they are introduced and the Priest is  told who Dr. Campbell is and a little about his life, he asks him,  &quot;Are you still Catholic?&quot; To which he replies &quot;No,  Father.&quot;  He then asks- and Campbell was impressed by his specificity-  &quot;Do you believe in a *personal* God?&quot; To which Campbell replies,  &quot;No, Father.&quot;<br />The Priest then replies, almost as if to engage  in a debate and denigrate the atheist's worship of the rational mind uber  alles simultaneously (and an atheist is what you are led to assume he  thinks Campbell is), &quot;Well, I guess there is no way to logically prove  the existence of God.&quot;  And Campbell answers, calmly, &quot;If there  were Father,  what would be the value of faith?&quot;<br />&quot;It's been a  pleasure meeting you Dr. Campbell, have a nice day.&quot;<br />Regardless of  your faith, interest, background or education, you will find yourself in  the same shoes of that Priest when you read this.  Campbell's erudition and  knowledge of the many ideas, subtexts and similarities inherent in the  world's treasure trove of mythology is daunting to say the least, and his  approach is designed to have it all make sense to the modern human's heart.  THE POWER OF MYTH may be the best Campbell book to serve as the doorway to  his world, his incredible mind, and the eternal wisdom of mythology, as it  manifests itself in every culture- not to mention our personal lives.<br />To  say it will make you think is almost denigrating it; it will make you  ponder.  It will lead you (after quite possibly confusing the hell out of  you, as you try to absorb it into a preexisting way of thinking that may  become obsolete via what he teaches) to wonder the way children wonder.  And in the end, you will smile from the soul, not just the heart.  I  highly recommend this as a Joseph Campbell and Mythology primer- and  recommend HERO OF A THOUSAND FACES after this has whet your appetite's  soul.children wonder.

IN THE MEANTIME is a good example of that.  The  experience of being in limbo, not knowing what you want, where to go, how  you got exactly where you are, where you should go from here, what you just  lost and what you are about to lose- it is all stuff that every human being  over the age of six can relate to (in fact, maybe, age TWO).  And yet our  ears are so closed, it seems, to our elders telling us all of what Iyanla  tells us in this book, with the catchy metaphor of cleaning house and the  equally catchy title (&quot;... and in-between time&quot;).  Nonetheless-  perhaps, as I said, specifically because of that- her book works well.<br />It is by no means a masterpiece.  The stories of falling in and out of  love are pretty much standard rep for these kinds of books (and hers in  particular).  More stories of being in career or moral limbo- people  discovering that their talent is bigger than their everyday dreams or  cynicisms, or those Hamlet moments in life when you discover that everyone  around you is lying about something around you- would have served her  thesis and intent much better.  And though she shies away from anything  that could even remotely sound preachy or judgmental (which is  unfortunate), her cleaning house metaphor works the best for those whose  more obvious messes in life- though a symbolic product of their inner  turmoil- are obvious and contributing to the confusion in their life  nontheless.  In other words, saying outright, &quot;Keep your house in  order&quot;, &quot;Make your bed&quot;, and using outdated ideas and words  like integrity and responsibilitiy even in the face of adversity, would  have probably worked even better for most people. Iyanla, like every  writer, has more liberty in these spiritually free times to rewrite some of  the self-knowledge derived from Biblical quotes and behavioral expectations  of men of integrity and women of religious virtue in the old days, without  scaring people.  Because that is really what she is saying; prepare for  the &quot;Lord's blessings&quot; (in however you understand either part of  that phrase) while walking through the valley of the SHADOW of death (the  meantime), and be patient; &quot;if you build it (and clean it up) they  will come.&quot;<br />This book makes a great gift, I think, better than a  &quot;keeper&quot; in one's own library.  I suggest buying it and reading  it, with joy, and then wrapping it up and passing it on to someone else,  with the same spirit of sharing.  In that sense, where a Bible-type or  conservative-toned lecture on virtue, etc. may turn somebody off, this book  may plant the seeds of faith and trust you want planted in a loved one's  mind and heart.nd responsibilitiy even in the face of adversity, would  have probably worked even better for most people.

It is almost hard to  believe- thanks to him- that the word could have ever taken on the  connotation of lie or trivial fantasy.  Or, that the ancient myths at the  foundation of what we know to be culture, universal in much of their form  and reason for being, could ever possibly be ignored or trivialized.  So  much wealth of human history do they hold, and so many treasures of inner  knowledge do they make as gifts.<br />Campbell set out to be not just a  scholar or intellectual, but a modern Bard of his own, in the tradition of  Homer, Sophecles, Confucius,  Shakespeare and Freud.  In so doing, he also  cut through much of the modern culture's historic efforts to divide the  world into some form of the Pagan/Believer dichotomy (via religon or  science or politics vs. the regular folks of every century and their  traditions) and reestablish the hegemony of the ancient truths that still  serve as the fountain head of our imagination.  HERO OF A THOUSAND FACES  does that so elegantly, and so compassionately, that it becomes a truly  life- affirming as well as paradigm shifting adventure.<br />Some scholars  have had and will continue to have problems with his work and approach.  Don't kid yourself; it's in part because he was such a wonderful writer who  can connect the daunting intellectual scope of his ideas with the general  public, almost regardless of one's level of education.  Weaker writers  cannot do that, regardless of their intellectual capacity or theories, and  hide in the ivory tower where it is safe.  Another reason, however, is the  degree to which his work relied on the psychological theories of Jung.  Though Jung's genius is also unquestionable, he did not provide the only  lens by which to look at ancient myth, and via staying so deeply in a  psychological paradigm (for more than just altruistic therapeutic reasons)  he served to antagonize variant approaches and perspectives on the same  materials. (Jungian psychologists and architects for example can almost  never sit in the same room together without a fistfight practically  ensuing, so violently and diametrically opposed they become on Jung's  interpretations of what very often is actually ancient science and  mathematics.)  Yet though I tend not to agree with a significant portion  of the meaning given to Campbell's work and discoveries anymore for that  reason, I cannot help but remember that it was he more or less who opened  my eyes to so much of what I now understand to be human and universal,  transcending culture, &quot;race&quot;, language and time.<br />Campbell's  unexpected bringing together of mythical similarities from Celtic, native  American, Indian, Bablyonian and other divergent world sources of myth is  done so well, and so poetically while again with great erudition, it will  put you in touch with much of what is beautiful in art, literature,  religion, and the human mind- not to mention the human heart. And of the  several of his books I have read, HERO OF A THOUSAND FACES is the best.

He does so in a way unlike I have ever seen or read before.  He makes it  so clear that science, technology and the quest of man to understand his  world and himself need not look  the way it was taught to us in any schools  we have attended- and in reality often isn't.<br />In simply documenting the  history and evolution of &quot;Pyramidology&quot;, the science of studying  the qualities, possible meanings and actual purposes of the great Pyramids  of Giza, Thompkins allows the unfolding of the unpredicatble- and  uncontrollable- nature of both scientific discovery and cultural  transformation to become fully visible to us in ways the mainstream  establishment in any of the traditional fields could never allow.  At one  point in the survey you will see the study of the Pyramids devolve into  cults; all documented evidence becomes at one time or another a metaphor  for a specific culture or sub-culture's socio-political agenda or  quasi-religious beliefs.  At other times, a prophet of science like the  English astronomer Lockyer- and his antecedents- will show up and flip the  world as you know it on its head.  Traditional Egyptology will at times  look even more cultish than the Pyramid watchers, with the revealing of its  willful ignorance of obvious scientific evidence that not just obliterates  but reveals the hidden psychology behind many of their long cherished  theories.<br />This seminal book, before you even get into the postscript  section with Livio Stechini's theory of ancient mathematics, is a lesson in  what it has been to be a citizen of Western culture as much as it is the  most eye-opening and thorough study of both Pyramidology and the Pyramids I  have ever read.<br />I have already read it twice, and can never seem to stop  getting more and more out of it.

Not to mention that by the time I picked up the phone later that morning to talk to the one I so deeply cared about but was enraged with, the anger was gone and the love returned, as if the vacuum Nature abhors was filled with love without my control.<br />This book is a treasure that goes deeper and beyond most if not all of the new thinker's books written in the past several years (if not decades) in the areas of spirituality, psychology and creativity. While so many wax poetically (or try to) on the religious and social constructs that have been at the foundation of everyone's life, Julia Cameron speaks from the point of view of the Creative Force, beuatiful in its unknowability...that is at the center of it all- all of our world, all of our art- all of our lives. What this book can do for artists and writers surpasses even that which Nietzsche made possible with his aphorisms in HUMAN, ALL TOO HUMAN on &quot;The Soul of Artists and Writers.&quot; To put all the pain of an artist- in fact, of human existence in total really- in terms of being blocked creatively is in and of itself remarkable.  ....

US	50366777	R381ZUDAZXEG97	0060927488	754343314	A Return to Love: Reflections on the Principles of "A Course in Miracles"	Books	3	18	37	N	N	Paradoxically beautiful and problematic	A good deal of time has gone by since I read this book, which interestingly enough was a gift of sorts from two of my ex-girlfriends: one suggested that I would love it while we were dating, another bought it as a  gift to me sometime afterward, as a way of saying how much she still cared.  The book, in its title alone, challenged me to release from judgement and  opinionating, and embrace God all around me.<br />So why not five stars you  ask?<br />After finishing the book, I was also more sensitive to my own  instincts and spirit.  And in so achieving a greater sensitivity via her  insightful words, I could not help but be troubled by some of the attitudes  expressed both in specific things she said, and the structure of the book  itself.<br />Both Karl Marx and Freud, as born-again atheist/agnostic Jews,  had this way of revealing not just their anxiety about their religious  tradition's influence, but an almost obssessive desire to replace it via  becoming a religious leader of their own movement.  It was as if to prove  that the Oedipal Complex theory was righter than even they could imagine,  bleeding into their undistinguished perspectives of the very religion of  their forefathers.  You see it and feel it in all of their work- part of  the reason Jung and Adler became persona non grata to Freud when they came  up with new ideas and stopped worshipping him, and Communism (give China  another minute) failed in the end.  Williamson, daughter of a devout  upper-middle class Jewish father and child of the Age of Aquarius 60's and  70's, is gifted with great understanding of a number of different eternal  concepts. But I couldn't help feeling that the inner &quot;spoiled  brat&quot; still angry with Daddy she discovered via her training in the  Course in Miracles is still her co-pilot in this book as much or more than  God is.  Similiar to how I felt when I finished SEAT OF THE SOUL by Gary  Zukav, I waited with bated breath for her to voluminously quote Martin  Luther King (whose book on the same subject, STRENGTH TO LOVE, written in  the early sixties is pretty deep, as you can imagine).  I waited with bated  breath to hear her summon the voice of Gandhi, and see his Gita- inspired  riffs dance like a God-intoxicated Sufi across the pages and into my mind  and soul.  I waited for her to quote the Old and New Testament (like  Corinthians, and talk a bit possibly about Paul), Kabbalic literature, and  God knows what else.<br />I'm still waiting.<br />The Course in Miracles I'm  sure must be a gift to us all, but the inner magic of it came from  somewhere, and as such agrees with the thoughts of a lot more famous people  over the centuries of time than just Marianne Williamson.  Though it would  have brought her ego down a peg, it would have only enhanced the majesty of  her spirit for her readers if they were acknowledged.  As I waited  patiently for the stamp of antiquity to fall on these newly minted but  eternally powerful and eternally RE-spoken words and ideas, it never came  to my satisfaction- when it came at all.<br />Her ideas on relationships and  what lie at the source of women's problems in them were equally problematic  as they also were only touched upon, as she flew past anecdotes on her days  in therapy. Ironically enough, the &quot;contempt for men&quot; that she  discovered lay at the source of much of her hurtful patterns of failed  relationships still seemed to run the show for HER life at the end of the  book, let alone those of her friends- particularly the one who was going  through hard times while dating a &quot;classic Peter Pan.&quot; (News  flash: nine times out of ten it's CINDERELLA who falls in love with the boy  who won't grow up; it's that simple- not complex.)  Such writing actually  managed to trivialize the problem of undistinguished male contempt and envy  AND relationship addiction, while simultaneously calling attention to it.  That paradoxically makes such previously undistinguished forces that much  MORE painfully influential in a woman's life, driven by the new batch of  New Age spirit-quotes she's been given to involuntarily teach her next  boyfriend.<br />In short (I know- too late, but anyway), the women who I know  who have read this book come away feeling wonderful about it, saying she is  a gift, and the book &quot;changed my life&quot;. The guys I know that date  them, and the friends of theirs who also read it but have known them and  their familiar behavior patterns (given proper stimuli) for years- and,  yes, I'm gonna say it, their Moms and (especially) Dads, would love to see  what change actually took place.  And the guys I know who have read it are  usually too afraid of being called a Troglodyte Joe six-pack closet rapist  who's going to Hell (where Oprah doesn't come in) if they disagree with  anything that was said.  And they do.<br />RETURN TO LOVE is a beautiful  weekend read, but if you still feel resentful at anyone who hasn't read it  or &quot;gotten it&quot; when they tell you you haven't changed, don't be  surprised if you will need to read the books cherished by Willaimson's oft-  stated heroes like King, Ghandhi and Jesus: the New Testament, Old  Testament and Gita (not to mention a little Nancy Friday thrown in for good  measure).  You, perhaps like Marianne herself, may need to be humbled  before you can be truly returned to the love you seek.  Love IS stronger  than arrogance.

And they do.<br />RETURN TO LOVE is a beautiful  weekend read, but if you still feel resentful at anyone who hasn't read it  or &quot;gotten it&quot; when they tell you you haven't changed, don't be  surprised if you will need to read the books cherished by Willaimson's oft-  stated heroes like King, Ghandhi and Jesus: the New Testament, Old  Testament and Gita (not to mention a little Nancy Friday thrown in for good  measure).   You, perhaps like Marianne herself, may need to be humbled  before you can be truly returned to the love you seek.  Love IS stronger  than arrogance.

The writers and their works become like sex, politics and religious conversations at  upscale parties; you don't discuss them not because they aren't valid, but  because they are too much so to accurately gage one's reaction to bringing  them up, or how personally they will take it, OR how upsetting someone's  lack of a concrete, well thought out and defensible opinion on it will be  perceived on both sides.  This is one of those.  Alan Alford's books,  particularly THE PHOENIX SOLUTION (currently only available in the UK; see  Amazon.co.uk) are the &quot;Hamlet's Mill&quot;s of our generation (said by  none other than Michael Rice, a great writer/Egyptologist himself), but  this is the prototype turned archtype for the final decades of the  twentieth century- and it isn't even Egyptological in nature.<br />  Schopenhauer once said that there are three stages for the life of an  emerging truth: first it is ignored or scorned, secondly there is violent  opposition... and then thirdly, it is accepted as self-evident.  It will  be some time before you develop the ability to see all of  the  religious/mythic/astronomical discoveries of deSantillana and von Dechend  as self-evident when you immediately put the book down (because there are  so many), but oh, when you do, it won't ever be forgotten.  Their proven  theories create a paradigm shift regarding perspectives on the Ancient and  Classical world that send ripples through everything, including our  misapplied view of Darwinian theory on prehistoric culture, and the basis  of religion and philosophy for the millenia following, right up until  today.  Their elucidation of the ancient scientific- as opposed to purely  gut-instinctual (aka non-existent) mind, done in an almost poetic but still  erudite fashion, makes for both a enlightening and page turning read.  The  stars have a way of becoming more beautiful when you read this book, as  they become really meaningful again.<br />This is the kind of book made more  for open minded scholars and those who appreciate their work, as opposed to  the realm of the out there, Astronaut theorists.  In fact, it made me  question the validity of the Bauvals and Hancocks of rogue Egyptology and  Babylonia/Sumerology that much more, because of how it ennobles the  communal prehistoric mind, beyond the need of extra-terrestrials to explain  its achievements.  It is made obvious by deSantillana that it is a  communal mind that our current prejudices have been made all but incapable  of understanding.<br />The only thing that could keep it from earning a  perfect five stars for me would be it's seemingly anxious way of ignoring  Egypt to tenously put ancient Sumerian culture at the center and forefront  of all knowledge.  It is almost the way you would nervously ignore a  drop-dead gogeous blonde who walks in to a party in a red mini-skirt and  leather, while your wife is staring at you angrily in her best dress. (In  other words, it paradoxically works to justify the work of Egyptologists  who say that &quot;ovah heeyah&quot; is where all the real beauty is, but  in an almost annoying way.)  That (let's call it) forgiveable prejudice  nonetheless also necessitated leaving out much of the rest of Africa in  their thesis, and obscuring some of the ancient Middle East- even in talk  of the actual meaning behind the drum and rhythm in religious ritual.  I  would suggest the work of Gerald Massey (ANCIENT EGYPT, THE LIGHT OF THE  WORLD) after spending a few nights with this one to pick up from where I  feel they drop the ball.<br />Nonetheless, its relevance and importance cannot  be overstated, as much for deSantillana's standing in academia (Professor  of the History of Science at MIT), as for what and how he and the equally  esteemed von Dechend wrote.  They also both gleefully acknowledge their  antecedents andintellectual mentors like Dupuis, Lockyer and Godfrey  Higgins, further reifying the field of scholarship that makes everyone in  stale academia more than a bit uncomfortable, and has for more than a  century.<br />(It also makes you look again at the genuis of Shakespeare  with whole new eyes!)<br />A very special book for all times.ntecedents and intellectual mentors like Dupuis, Lockyer and Godfrey  Higgins, further reifying the field of scholarship that makes everyone in  stale academia more than a bit uncomfortable, and has for more than a  century.   <br />(It also makes you look again at the genuis of Shakespeare  with whole new eyes!)<br />A very special book for all times.	2000-06-16

With every new innovation and social  argument today, from birth control and feminism to the media and privacy,  we all find ourselves suspiciously willing to turn over every intellectual  rock and make hamburger out of every sacred cow in the search for enemies,  heroes, reasons and justifications for our beliefs and actions.  Yet with  fear and trembling we all ignore this one- which Neil Postman makes all too  clear may be the only one we should be discussing: the surrendering of all  of our true sense of freedom, independence, responsibility and community to  the wrathful, jealous god of Technology.  In the opening to the book he  quotes a philosopher who sums up his entire point with an idea that puts  our entire cultural period into a disturbing perspective: regardless of its  basis in scientific innovation and theory, technology \\"is a branch of  moral philosophy, not science.\\"  The mere thought that our entire  world and the daily transformations taking place in it may be in the wrong  hands- at our request- and that THAT is the explanation for the incredible  degree of unquestioned, unexamined change, is enough to make you afraid of  your computer.  And remember, this book was published years before Dolly  the cloned sheep came to town, or we were anywhere near as close to  charting the entire human genome.  (Like the relationship of Einstein's  theories to the Manhattan Project, with that alone we have no idea what  world we are in store for or what war in the twenty-first century will be  like; yet we go blindly onward, giving our scientific leaders and CEOs of  industry carte blanche, without questioning if we have a choice.)  Postman  simply makes it clear that the people who are taking us where we are headed  don't really know what they're doing anymore than we do in terms of the  implications for our culture- or any culture's- future, and really don't  care. Because they have sold their souls to the idea of progress and  markets- falling in line with the dictates of the cult of technology.  Many countries around the world see Globalization as little more than the  Americanization of the world, like Rome around the time of Christ.  Postman's TECHNOPOLY makes it clear that that force may have malevolent  implications because it could actually be built upon the transformation of  American democracy and culture into that of technological fascism. With  every chapter, some almost hilarious in the little absudities we live by  made clear, some scary in their implications and explanations of the  seemingly unrelated ills of our world, Neil Postman creates one of the  greatest and most important diagnoses of the Achilles heel of modern  Western Society ever written.  TECHNOPOLY is prophetic, and like every  prophet, what he has to say will only be apocalyptic to our world if we  choose to ignore it..)

And then it is almost  expected that we fly into our abstract heads and think of things like  television and the internet- or just recently sex- when we think of  possible things to be addicted to, devoid of any sense of connection to a  deeper-seeded emotional or psychological condition.  Hollis brings such a  compassionate but painstakingly thorough analysis of the addiction to food  and the painful emotions it both masks and magnifies- and then moves out  into the relationships of those suffering from it- that you cannot help but  believe, and be moved.<br />When you begin to see that underneath every  bouncing, life of the party- or quiet and mousy- woman in a size 20 or  bigger dress is an enraged and hurting soul who has learned to be afraid of  everything involving either intimacy, independence or risk- to the  detriment of joy in her life- you will see all women differently.  And the  guy with the beer belly may be telling the same story.<br />Hollis manages  to underscore and illuminate this problem without being maudlin or  dramatic, or victimizing people out of a sense of personal power.  Instead  she allows not just people with eating disorders to see what is happening  and how to come through it, but those involved with them, often  codependently, to see that they have a path to walk to reality as well.  After reading this book so many reoccurring issues in my relationships  became impossible to ignore or explain away, as they all centered around my  weight, her weight, and my fears of forging ahead in my career (and being  alone while doing it).<br />Women must be reminded that you don't have to look  like Tyra Banks to be beautiful.  But they must also have it known that you  don't have to be suffering with a body that is more a cry for help than it  is an honest expression of who they are.  And, that people who love you-  family and friends- have almost as much responsibility as you do, to bring  love and trust and honest relating and support into your life.  The  behavioral paradigms of fear and grief do not discriminate; neither does  forgiveness, wisdom, or love.<br />I advise anyone who can relate to the  emotional issues, personality traits, behavior patterns and relationship  games/dramas laid out in this book to take it seriously.

Pfaff rips loose the  real meaning of words like &quot;culture&quot;, &quot;race&quot;,  &quot;solidarity&quot;, &quot;community&quot;, and even  &quot;politics&quot; from the intellectual, emotional, and quasi-religious  force that is nationalism- a political system redefining all of the above  through the small lens of populations, collective hyper-logical interests  mythologized, and geography.  I didn't realize that countries as we have  come to know them and their peoples were not essentially like they are now  a thousand years ago- which makes me look at everything in the political  and cultural arena differently.  What has been the effect of this force  called nationalism on the human mind and the human soul?  How can it be bad  if it helped destroy Nazism; how can it be good if it turns neighbors and  families with ancient bloodlines into bloodthirsty enemies, like in Kosovo,  or our own Civil War?  WRATH OF NATIONS attempts to answer these questions,  and many others I didn't think to ask.<br />Pfaff's treatise on nationalism is  as much psychological as it is historical and political.  And on those  grounds it is well worth reading.	2000-06-16

R.F. Thompson, who I had the pleasure of meeting once in the Metropolitan Museum  of Art in New York, is someone who along with being highly knowledgeable  cares a great deal for the subject.  Where the book could be considered  lacking I would say is it's way of seeming dated.  It bares some cultural  prejudice which, considering the cultural remoteness of the subject matter  when compared to the intellectual/cultural arena of the writer(African and  African-American, Afro-Cuban/Hispanic culture vs. Post-World War II Ivy  League) - and how well he did anyway- is forgiveable, but present  nonetheless.  If you are expecting some pretty powerful things to be said  about Coltrane, or the early days of Rap music and Hip-hop dance (now in  its third decade of existence already), or Modigliani, or other things that  are in the forefront of the present culture's mind, to a certain degree you  will be disappointed.  However, if you had no idea other than the Alex  Haley &quot;Roots&quot; era rhetoricals about the derivation of many  African-American and Hispanic/Hispanic-American cultural paradigms, this  will enlighten you in ways that will have you going to the bookstore to see  what else he and many others have written on the subjects.  I recommend  it- particularly for lovers of European modern art, studies of religion,  and other things influenced by the Mother country.	2000-06-07

It gets better and better everytime.<br />  Gerald Massey is much like Freud, a man whose herculean intellect  combined with his  revolutionary discoveries  (and in Freud's case obvious character flaws) make people  long after him debate his relevance in the intellectual world he  himself created (kind of  like debating the  existence of Frank Lloyd Wright's art in the Guggenheim Museum).  What stops this book from being a five star epic is  simply his tendency to ramble,  creating a  labyrinthian world of insight and ideas that can confuse the reader. Yet  his  work is so meaningful, and so provocative,  that it is has only been in the last few years,  with the advent of Mega-book outlets like Amazon.com, that his books were  available  outside of the occult or Afrocentric  bookstore.<br />  Gerald Massey was not an  &quot;Afrocentric&quot; as we have come to know the term today-  which is now seen as pejorative. That is what makes him  all the more important. In fact,  one major  reason that his work has been written off for most of this century, is that  his  logical deductions, gathered from the  variety of disciplines that work so logically  together, fly in the face of conventional scholarly wisdom without an  obvious thing for  him to gain from it in the  form of reputation or finances. His work reifies the linguistic,  astronomical/religious, architectural and  Darwinian/evolutionary perspectives to such a  degree that devout Christians and Greco/Roman cultural sepremacists should  beware  this book. It will shake the very  foundations of your faith before giving you the space to  reclaim it with a new point of view; particularly in his decoding  of the origins of our  comparitively modern  religious beliefs and literary myths.<br />  Like  it or not, Gerald Massey was one of those authors that turn your mind  upside  down, like Alice's looking glass, to  the point where you wonder what is the &quot;real&quot; ancient  world, and its influence on the world after it- up to and  including today.

I'll say this about it:<br />Forget the indespensible information on the completely non-existent nutritional value of refined sugar. Forget the anecdotal mind-blowing gems like how mosquitos and other disease carrying insects fly past a recovered sugar addict's body because they are no longer attracted to what was once sweet smelling and tasting blood. Forget the paradigm shift his expose demands on the causes of a significant portion of all automobile accidents in this country. Forget his linking glucose intolerence to diseases--diagnosed, undiagnosed and falsely diagnosed over the centuries--from tooth decay to epilepsy to heart diesase to schizophrenia to lung cancer.<br />Just ruminate on the historical facts brought out by this man that the hunger for refined sugar, and the subsequent addiction to this mind and body destroying chemical are the architects of:<br />1) the African Slave trade in Europe and the Americas<br />2)the disconnected and disjunct philosophies of mind and body health being separate entities in Western medicine (just now being gradually overturned) unlike everywhere else in world history<br />3)\\"Pagan\\"/mental illness-related diseases of mythical, otherwise inexplicable derivation<br />4) the chemical dependency supply-and-demand relationship and geo-political international trade structure that made everything from the decimation of Native American tribes and lands in the Americas to the drug corporations near dominance of today's American economy, to the Medellin and Sicilian cartels of heroin and cocaine *creating international public policy today* not just possible but INEVITABLE...<br />In short, Mr. Dufty has written one of the most important books of this century, bar none.

But it's impossible not to get emotional about what this man shows us and teaches us.

US	50366777	R3KHQDRMJ1Y11X	067169507X	560916915	The Seat of the Soul	Books	3	110	153	N	N	Nice but not provocative or revolutionary	When I first read this book a year ago I found it entertaining more than enlightening- though it does offer many enlightening ideas.  That bothered me- particularly when the public's reaction seemed to be otherwise.  The  cause is simple: It deeply troubles me at how ignorant our modern  Western/American culture still remains to its own spiritual traditions, let  alone to those of the East in Buddhism and Hinduism.  These are the actual  source of the overwhelming majority of both his direct insights and his  indirect interpretation of them via psychological and quantum physics  analogies. In the preface of his book he mentions how great thinkers like  Einstein searched for meaning in the universe beyond what the path of their  professional methodologies would provide, and found it when seeking beyond  them. He hesitates however, and in the end really neglects, to discuss  where those searches brought them. Seeing Oprah fall all over him like he  was a cross between Jesus and Ricky Martin when he first was hailed by her,  was equally distressing to me for the same reasons, only writ large.<br />Realistically speaking, it takes a stereotypically American born,  superpower arrogance to accept his ideas as either revolutionary, or  transcending the doctrines of any psychological/spiritual paradigm in  existence before them.  Gore Vidal's nickname for our country is the USA-  &quot;United States of Amnesia&quot;, and Zukav's writing style, along with  a lot of the public acclaim, seems to confirm that culturally identifying  illness as still being true.  The reality is, with our booming internet  economy and Pentagon, we don't need a familiarity with ancient philosophies  or even a relationship with our own foundational cultural traditions to  maintain hegemony over the rest of the world. That is, for better AND worse  (even with that pesky China), a fact proven every day. Therefore, history  in general and what it can teach us- religious/philosophical history or  otherwise- is still rendered trivia, unless it is in the form of near  tabloid biography, making it marketable. Even then it is quickly forgotten  before it is even digested. The sublime truth in the truism,  &quot;everything old is new again&quot; when regarding New Age ideas vs.  ancient metaphysical/gnostic religious text, ruthlessly chips away at our  modern illusions and pretensions regarding &quot;the NEW&quot;, and our  status as First, Best and Number One- the foundation of so much of our  material and psychological lives. That sublime truth, as opposed to Gary's  book, demands a humility that we as Americans no longer understand, in  order for us to embrace our true selves as universal, spiritual beings. I  say &quot;that, as opposed to Gary's book,&quot; because one would swear he  woke up one morning and thought up all of this in a vaccuum after reading  it.<br />If you find yourself caught up in the paradigm of hubris leading to  ignorance leading to ego worship leading to confusion and fear, effectively  shutting you off from a healthy relationship with yourself, others, and any  other window to truth in this world- as we all do at some point (hell, I  bought the book and read it myself for a reason), then make no mistake,  regardless of what I said above you will get a great deal out of this book.  (Momentarily.) What he has to say is wonderful, and, his interpretation of  ancient philosophical and religious text is also illuminating, as if it  were directly translated into today's everyday language in it's best  passages. But, as he simply refuses to make clear or even casually refer to  where much of it comes from, as if the knowledge gave birth to itself and  has no parents, it ironically feeds on the very problem it is supposed to  help you conquer in the first place. I am sure many have read this and come  to the conclusion that, since he has &quot;figured it out&quot;, they are  even less dependent on their Judeo-Christian heritage and even more  superior to their Hindu or Budhhist brother who continues to pray or  meditate in the old fashioned way, and has yet to make the New York Times  bestseller list. Thus the arrogance, and the corresponding myopia of the  ego obstructing the true vision of the Soul-Self remains firmly intact,  long before Oprah cuts to a commercial. That, I believe, is what actually  lies at the center of so many people in spiritual pain; the very paradigm  of thought and living that his marketable way of sharing the truth  empowers.<br />Zukav &quot;discovers&quot; the seat of the soul in much the  same way Columbus &quot;discovered&quot; America (or Elvis  &quot;invented&quot; rock and roll). Whether you're an already there  &quot;Indian&quot; who has been living in this world of spiritual humility,  or a skeptic who still thinks the inner world is flat (or a publishing  version of Queen Isabella who has much to gain materially from these kinds  of voyages) the literary and psychological medium Gary Zukav chose to  convey his ideas- one of true, well meaning benevolence, but  undistinguished cultural arrogance, I believe- is really the message of the  book.  And just like Chinese take-out, though you'll feel good and happy  and full when you finish it, it won't keep you satisfied or help you know  God days, months and years afterward as well as you might expect.<br />Gary  Zukav reinvents the wheel very nicely in this book. It's just a pity that  so many people seem not to realize that that is what he's done. This book  will be of great service to people if it succeeds in whetting the appetite  for all who read it, and compels them to reread the Old and New Testaments,  the Gnostic gospels /Nag Hammadi Library, the Egyptian and Tibetan Books of  the Dead, the Gita and so on, with new eyes and open hearts and minds. SEAT  OF THE SOUL is another example of that one fish that can feed a man's soul  for a day, where the world's ancient religious texts will help teach you  how to fish, and feed yourself for a lifetime.superior to their Hindu or Budhhist brother who continues to pray or  meditate in the old fashioned way, and has yet to make the New York Times  bestseller list. Thus the arrogance, and the corresponding myopia of the  ego obstructing the true vision of the Soul-Self remains firmly intact,  long before Oprah cuts to a commercial. That, I believe, is what actually  lies at the center of so many people in spiritual pain; the very paradigm  of thought and living that his marketable way of sharing the truth  empowers.<br />Zukav &quot;discovers&quot; the seat of the soul in much the  same way Columbus &quot;discovered&quot; America (or Elvis  &quot;invented&quot; rock and roll). Whether you're an already there  &quot;Indian&quot; who has been living in this world of spiritual humility,  or a skeptic who still thinks the inner world is flat (or a publishing  version of Queen Isabella who has much to gain materially from these kinds  of voyages) the literary and psychological medium Gary Zukav chose to  convey his ideas- one of true, well meaning benevolence, but  undistinguished cultural arrogance, I believe- is really the message of the  book.  And just like Chinese take-out, though you'll feel good and happy  and full when you finish it, it won't keep you satisfied or help you know  God days, months and years afterward as well as you might expect.<br />Gary  Zukav reinvents the wheel very nicely in this book. It's just a pity that  so many people seem not to realize that that is what he's done. This book  will be of great service to people if it succeeds in whetting the appetite  for all who read it, and compels them to reread the Old and New Testaments,  the Gnostic gospels /Nag Hammadi Library, the Egyptian and Tibetan Books of  the Dead, the Gita and so on, with new eyes and open hearts and minds. SEAT  OF THE SOUL is another example of that one fish that can feed a man's soul  for a day, where the world's ancient religious texts will help teach you  how to fish, and feed yourself for a lifetime.	2000-05-27

It is impossible not to read this book and consciously, actively search for people in your life for whom this book had to be written for- and people in  politics and the media, and anyone who has ever given you a bad day-  ANYONE, but yourself.  It is impossible to read this book and not find  yourself at times trembling with being put in touch with your deepest  insecurities, and the root causes which you have been denying for most if  not all of your life.<br />It is, wonderfully enough, also impossible to  read this and not feel a profound connection to the world.  It is  impossible to read this and not have a lasting respect and understanding of  the common sense of Medeieval and Renaissance Catholics in European  history, who made a point of teaching this most deadly of the seven deadly  sins every week, if not every day, to their children, without needing  Freud, the internet, or a degree from Harvard.  It is impossible not to  acknowledge your own anger or even contempt and hatred at that which you  logically have no right to be in your life or society, or those for whom  the world would expect you to be the most compassionate, while seeingthat  everyone does exactly the same thing in some way.<br />Nancy Friday removes a  lot of the veils and mystery over today's inexplicable suffering, from the  seemingly sweet kind woman with the profoundly damaged children and  destroyed marriage, to the erudite upwardly mobile socialites in prison for  committing crimes of passion- to the everyday person like most of us, who  somehow manages to push away everything we say we want, and damage it when  we get it.<br />It is impossible not to be on the road to living a better,  more enjoyable life after really reading this book with a humble heart.	2000-05-16

Peele's LOVE AND ADDICTION is about the most concise, eye-opening and, in light of how the problems he  documents in American society have only been geometrically exacerbated in  the twenty-five years since it was published (now inlcuding an addiction to  guns), the most disturbing of the self-help books I have ever read.  With  the exception of Nancy Friday's JEALOUSY, not since Bradshaw's HOMECOMING,  published in 1991, has a book with a psychological theme sent such powerful  vibrations through me, forcing me to look again at my life.  It  effectively removes the veil covering the sad connection between  diametrically opposed (and mutually ineffective) views on politics,  religion, sex and sexual freedoms, romance, family, marriage,  relationships, crimes of all kinds and the spectre/epidemic of drug  addiction in the U.S.- as well as the international history of it all.<br />Many have said with wisdom- often quoting Martin Luther King or a  Buddhist philosopher- that we are all joined together in one unified life,  like threads in the fabric of society, and until we are all free, no one or  group of us truly are.  LOVE AND ADDICTION proves such poetic wisdom  scientifically for the western mind, and its increasingly growing more  fragile soul.  Dr. Peele begins to show us the paradox of American society  that is crippling us: how we are being psychologically crushed under the  weight of our own technological innovations and tremendous freedoms, and  how that affects ever single one of us, in all of our relationships, with  everyone and everything.<br />You will learn more about your world- including  that of present day self-help book writers with the same problems he  delineates- than you may ever have wanted to know.  Because he says what  you think you already know in a way that makes it all but impossible to  ignore.<br />This book needs to be reprinted, and made available to the  general public, now.

I sense what it must have been like at the turn of the century when the works of Nietszche and Freud- her intellectual precursors and patron saints- had their works argued and denounced and quickly lauded simultaneously.  The beauty of this book, beyond her shining, acrobatic, intellect, is that it leaves you changed.  This is not a dime-store novel- type intellectual polemic, that leaves you as if you just read the Harvard English professor's version of the National Enquirer.  This is the kind of work that, when you put down, you become a renter in the apartment building of the author's mind- regardless of how much of your own furniture of opinions you choose to bring with you.  To say I agree with her findings is almost irrelevant- in fact, that may be the central beauty of the whole thing.  It is impossible to agree or diagree without seeing the world through her frame of reference while trying to prove your point- just as Freud and Nietzsche amde you do- and still do- before her.<br />If there are any faults that would render it unworthy of a perfect five star rating, I wouldn't go with the feeling of being exhausted by her erudition or polemic style.  Even the cultural narcissism- obviously coming out of her Rolling Stones/Woodstock days of youth, which bleeds through her education- is forgiveable.  Her only major fault I would say is what could best be called &quot;Afro-phobia&quot;, and her avoidance of the African influence on Western culture, and its many sophisticated artistic and sexual/religious mores made manifest through the ages in not just 20th Century America.<br />Nonetheless, if you are even remotely fascinated by the subject matter- or any one of the God knows how many subjects, from sex to politics, it touches on while she proves her central thesis, you will immensely enjoy this book.<br />If your interest goes beyond that, you may find yourself as I have, ready to change the shape and the direction of your career.<br />Either way, you cannot look at the soul of art, artists and writers the same afterwards.oes beyond that, you may find yourself as I have, ready to change the shape and the direction of your career.<br />Either way, you cannot look at the soul of art, artists and writers the same afterwards.	2000-04-10

Toni Morrison becomes the metaphor herself, along with her invented  characters, as a story of love and passion, anger and rage, sorrow and  grief, hunger and lonliness, acknowledgement, and quiet, earhty epiphany  unfolds as uncontrollably as the tides,with all the simple complexity of a  jazz riff- and with as much freedom from judgement. Toni Morrison's  descriptive powers sweeping across the landscape of history and the  landscape of the individual character's lives is frightening in its ability  to overwhelm.  She brings out the raw, triumphant humaness of each  character with such lyricism and painful joy. The novel can at times feel  like a giant denoument, yet its slowly building climaxes are what make it  more than readable; they make it exciting, sublimely predictable and  unpredictable simultameuosly. It almost makes one understand better why the  story of Christ is called a &quot;Passion&quot;; passion, as exemplified in  this novel, is not just a sexy or damaging thing, but also the way to come  to know God.<br />There are small pars of the novel that are a bit too  detailed in the rendering of lesser character's lives. Yet her rendering of  the time period- Harlem in the 20's, and the community is incredible. This  is more, or different, than a novel. It is an epic poem- an epic jazz poem  that has you hearing the music as it mildly, painfully, poignantly and  triumphantly ends. Toni will not let you down with this one.	2000-01-18

It was undoubtedly not when it was written, and though it may have saved a  few million lives had it been publicly wrassled with before the advent of  Nazism, the world was probably not ready for it until now.  Of the books  that I have proclaimed being of the most important written this century  (Edward Said's ORIENTALISM, Bernal's BLACK ATHENA, Bradshaw's HOMECOMING,  Campbell's HERO OF A THOUSAND FACES, deSantillana and von Dechend's  HAMLET'S MILL among them), this book, written a century BEFORE (c. 1830's),  towers above them all.<br />This book, which I have yet to finish, is NOT for  the faint of heart, by any stretch of the imagination. Despite the fact  that it will probably have the paradoxical effect of reinvigorating your  faith in whatever one you have chosen- after a time- beyond anything else  could.  The style has its obvious flaws, and does contribute to its ability  to overwhelm.  But trust me, it won't stop you.<br />Of all the books I have  recommended to friends and family and strangers, I have to say with this  staggering epic:<br />Read it at your own risk.  Read it and be changed.	1999-12-31

I would  have loved if he added another hundred pages to it all, allowing him to  speak more about three topics in particular: 1) the socio-political  implications of the culture of drugs among the musicians, 2) the  transformation of jazz's link with debauchery through be-bop to that of  spirituality and freedom in the American mind, epitomized via Coltrane in  the 60's, and 3) the musical/theatrical/Griot/Delphic roles of the jazz  singer in perpetuating the music and magic of the art form, from Armstrong  to Bobby McFerrin.  But with the kind of work Gioia has given us with this,  I'll just have to shut up and write my own, and hope it holds up.<br />I  highly recommend this book if you are a musician of any style (I am a jazz  and opera singer).  If you know someone who loves jazz, or has even a  passing interest in its icons (the even handedness with which he explains  Wynton alone makes the book worth having), the book is a great gift- you  don't need a Doctorate in Music theory or semiotics to enjoy it.  And if  you are a jazz musician, you should own it.  Period.<br /> A fine book; a  fine contribution.	1999-12-31

After surveying twelve leading high school American history texts, he has concluded that not one does a decent job of making history interesting or memorable. Marred by an embarrassing combination of blind patriotism, mindless optimism, sheer misinformation, and outright lies, these books omit almost all the ambiguity, passion, conflict, and drama from our past. In ten powerful chapters, Loewen reveals that: <br />=The United States dropped three times as many tons of explosives in Vietman as it dropped in all theaters of World War II, including Hiroshima and Nagasaki <BR>=Ponce de Leon went to Florida mainly to capture Native Americans as slaves for Hispaniola, not to find the mythical fountain of youth <BR>=Woodrow Wilson, known as a progressive leader, was in fact a white supremacist who personally vetoed a clause on racial equality in the Covenant of the League of Nations <BR>=The first colony to legalize slavery was not Virginia but Massachusetts <br />From the truth about Columbus's historic voyages to an honest evaluation of our national leaders, Loewen revives our history, restoring to it the vitality and relevance it truly possesses.\\"<br />Book Description of <BR>LIES MY TEACHER TOLD ME: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong<BR>by James Loewen<br />Our lack of understanding of our own history as Americans would be laughable if it weren't so sad...yet we dare not question the history of ancient cultures as we have been told of the past two to five thousand years?<br />\\"...Some modern scholars trace the name of the star [Sirius] in the hieroglyphic of the dog, evoking the god Anubis...The ancient Greeks, who took over so much of the Egyptian Wisdom, called 'Spdt' by the name Sothis, yet it remained the dog star in their calendars, and it was used by both Greeks and Egyptians in the orientation of important temples.<br />\\"...It wasthis promise of stellar immutability which had led the ancient Egyptian priests, AND THEIR PUPILS THE GREEK ARCHITECTS, to orientate their temples to the stars.   It was this same promise which led the designers of Washington, D.C. to ensure that their own new city was also laid out in accordance with a geometry which reflected the wisdom of the stellar lore.\\"<br />David Ovason<BR>THE SECRET ARCHITECTURE OF OUR NATION'S CAPITAL<BR>Chapter One (emphasis mine)<BR>  <br />I often wonder if people have actually read this book cover to cover and sat with it for a moment or two, before formulating their opinions of it and challenging the credentials and motivations of its author. What makes this book one of the most important of this now ending century has only indirectly anything to do with the majesty of Ancient Egypt--a culture we truly have yet to be introduced to, even in enjoying to the present day its legacy on the mind and culture of the modern world.<br />Bernal challenges us all to look at the historians responsible for the mental architecture of our perspective on both the ancient and, subsequently, the modern world, and the socio-political/cultural milieu in which they found themselves with the same skepticism with which his detractors demand he submit to. With a great deal of modern scholarship proven to be mythically based, he has earned the raking over the coals he has received--but for mostly the right reasons.<br />BLACK ATHENA, ranks among the most important and far reaching books of this closing century for the debate it provokes, the questions they demand be re-asked regardless of the answers, and the flood gates of heretofore excommunicated literauture it legitimizes and acknowledges; literature and careful historical study in a world where, up until the wiriters responsible, anyone to disagree with the accepted conventional wisdom was considered a crank or a communist/demagogue by definition. Never did I gather from his work that he infer ancient Greek Culture did not exist independently from its African/Egyptian/Semetic influences. His work is even nearly devoid of the rhetoric (regardless of the sources provided) of the litany of his Afrio-centric Egyptological antecedents--the writers of which go back more than a century.<br />The mere possibility of the particulars of his work being historically accurate, proving by default the validity of his hypothesis--BASED PURELY ON HIS WELL DOCUMENTED HISTORY OF THE SOCIOLOGY OF KNOWLEDGE IN 19TH CENTURY EUROPE--is the real source of any anxiety, or excitement.<br />Again, as we enter the twenty-first century, I invite anyone coming upon this title to read one of the most important works of the twentieth. The generations yet to come will wonder why the book even needed to be written, much less argued about.	1999-12-31

After a time, we come to believe that a movement, not advanced by  war or the economic equivalent of such tyranny, was something that was  simply meant to be.  We will even begin to give credit to the erstwhile  disciples of the movement- those who ride the crest of a preexisting wave-  in a search for who to acknowledge; in part from a fear of believing an  individual can in fact change the world so profoundly with insight,  creativity and generosity.<br />John Bradshaw's HOMECOMING is such a work, and  he is such a man.  His ideas have long since become the stuff of  trivialization, as the buzz phrase &quot;inner child&quot; has been drained  of its marketable exploitation and appeal.  And yet that trivialization has  been a response to the degree to which we are now intellectually and  emotionally living in his world.<br />I rank this book as one of the most  important written during this now ending twentieth century.  Make no  mistake, our concerns about something as seemingly unrelated as child labor  practices in India and China today, and how much we care about it now (when  it has existed for centuries, just like here) can be traced back in part  back to Bradshaw's influence in how we see the life of children, and  subsequently the inner and outer life of adults- ourselves.<br />Its effect on  the world as we know it will be felt for years to come, long after it has  been forgotten or redefined as a late eighties/early nineties pop  psychology fad.<br />Do not be surprised by the books and authors, living and  dead, of a multiplicity of disciplines, you find yourself drawn to after  reading this.  Do not also be surprised at how well it teaches you about  who you are, and how deeply it touches your soul.	1999-12-31

Irving Stone's work has already been praised thoughout his lifetime.  Nonetheless, it is important  to know that this is one of those works of art that seems to come from a  mythical language that is the source of both truth and creativity, thereby  effectively blurring the line separating novel from history while  simultaneously enriching both art forms AND the subject.  This is why  scholars and art lovers alike have read this and enjoyed it so.  There will  be parts of this work where you will not be able to understand the  motivation for van Gogh's actions, or the source of his inspiration.  And  there will be times when you will swear the book is about you. So  profoundly does he capture the soul of the artist- and all artists- and in  so doing the communal soul of humanity.<br />It is impossible not to enjoy  this book.  If you love Impressionism, Amsterdam/Holland, Paris, art, fine  writingng, biography, or any combination of the above- and of course, if  you are an artist (I am a writer and musician), this book may change you.	1999-12-31

It takes a book like this where he leaves no stone unturned to make clear the debt we  all owe him and his contemporaries, as well as the restless spirit that  lead him beyond what he helped to establish as modern jazz.  In many ways  he shows himself to be, ironically, the archetypal and sterotypical artist  simultaneously.  Yet his telling of the profound friendships he had with  Max Roach and Coltrane, his deep awe and respect but dispassionate eye for  the genius and addictions of Charlie Parker, the loves of his life- and  what he put them through, and his brutal, courageous hoonesty in general,  gives us a gift of his haunting humanity.<br />But above all, this about the  music.  His own telling of his style, the true creators of the form in  total and the actual environment where it was produced, and how he created  so many styles of his own is enough to make this book worth having.<br />You  will never find another human being who can make curse words sound so  beautiful!<br />If you love jazz, or are a jazz musician, this book will  remind you why.  And why you love Miles. Everybody does.	1999-09-28

So many books and writers, like those of Alice Walker  (with the exception of that masterpiece ...PURPLE), Gloria Naylor and the  &quot;Exhale&quot; lady, Terry McMillan, actually denigrate women quite  often through the simplification of their characters' desires and the  justification of their motivations for every questionable action.  It takes  a Toni Morrison to create a Sula: as ugly as she is beautiful, as dangerous  as she is harmless, with a friend as lazy and naive as she is hard working,  committed, wise and true.  Complex, human black women with souls instead of  issues and manifestoes; what a gift.  Regardless of any faults that may lay  in the realization of such characters in the novel, she developed real  people to relate to or be amazed by.  Critiques can only come in response  to the depth of what she's created- as if she didn't in fact create it, and  surpass it in other novels!  I enjoyed it.	1999-08-17

Duberman, through obviously painstaking research (despite the voluminous material afforded him via Robeson's archives and the Freedom of Information Act's allowing for the research of FBI surveillance files) creates a portrait both panoramic in scope and theme and highly, meticulously detailed.  He reaffirms the truism truth is stranger than fiction- and more exhilirating- by bringing us to an intimate knowledge of the many worlds of Paul Robeson-  stage and screen actor, concert hall singer, athlete, academician, lawyer, linguist, political/quasi-communist/Civil Rights revolutionary, African-American youngest son of an Episcopal minister- in such a way as to have us be part of the childlike sloughing off of arrogance and ignorance that is the first step in an initiation; an initiation to the higher mysteries of knowledge of the human character and spirit in the context of the modern world; the path Duberman's incredible skill as a writer and biographer clearly shows he has taken.  He shows his profound love and respect for the man and his influence of and on American culture by staring unflinchingly at everything from his sexual proclivities and many mistresses to his powerful intellect and international appeal, to his consistent challenging of the prevailing moral schizophrenia of pre-Civil Rights movement America and the subsequent ruination of his career and sanity- all within the context of his familial and cultural ties and his immense talent.  Duberman makes one of many things abundantly clear: no nerve on the body politic and the cultural fabric of twentieth century American society was not touched- often wrung, by the tenacity, stubborness, courage, love and immense talent of the many avatars of Paul Robeson.  It is impossible to simplify o! r romanticize a life so profoundly influential and complex without ultimately obscuring the very heroic character one- whether they liked him or not- would be attempting to portray.  Duberman, in refusing to do so succeeds brilliantly.  I felt deeply personally cleansed as well as enlightened about a figure whose influence I now understand has been purposely footnoted into history, as well as why he was, and shouldn't be anymore.  Duberman gives a Nietzschean &quot;Ubermensch&quot; rendering of Paul Robeson that every human being- particularly every kind of American- will find gloriously, uncomfortably, provocatively and simultaneously both tragic and triumphant.
