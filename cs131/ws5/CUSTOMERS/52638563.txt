US	52638563	R1QJ672KTL08WY	1591391865	547553232	The Medici Effect: Breakthrough Insights at the Intersection of Ideas, Concepts, and Cultures	Books	3	58	69	N	Y	Grand title, but hollow book	The title of the book is very grand. However, the content of the book is far inferior to the title. I was expecting the concepts or ideas that would bring about splendors in philosophy, art and science in great magnitudes just like what took place in Renaissance, but instead the author just filled the pages mostly with small and insignificant examples and stories. <br /> <br />This is just a book on creativity. Its significance is not as big as the recent book, \\"A whole new mind,\\" or older books such as \\"At work with Edison.\\" It would be much better if the author can focus his study on how Renaissance came about and on how to replicate or recreate the favorable environment and fertile ground for bringing about another Renaissance on a comparable or even greater scale. <br /> <br />The biggest flaw of this book is that even though the main thesis of the book is on many people from single-disciplinary background coming together to create something multidisciplinary, most of the examples in the book are about single individuals having multidisciplinary abilities creating something new and not at all at the scale of the Renaissance. Besides the brain-reading program and the British code-breaking group mentioned in the book, all other examples were single individuals. So, where is the Medici effect of people coming together? <br /> <br />The second flaw of this book is the assumption that when people come together, a Renaissance will happen. The author is asserting that diversity in ethnicity, geography, age, and gender have a greater chance of coming up with unique ideas. This is wrong. What's needed is diversity of expertise, not just diversity. Diversity of mediocrity does not mean increased chance of creativity. <br /> <br />In summary, I am very disappointed in this book. The title shows great promise, but the author couldn't deliver it. There is much work to be done to understand and promote multidisciplinary creativity. This is one of the very few books that touchon this subject. There is much work to be done in this area. And if we want to create a new Renaissance, then the work becomes monumental! <br />	2005-04-26

One tends to think the book is all about analyzing and dissecting thinking patterns and methods of Einstein and people like him, and how to apply this to our education and training so that the great masses can be benefited. But such is not the case with the book. <br /> <br />The author's biggest theme seems to be linking visual thinking with 3-D computer graphics, and suggesting that by using 3-D graphics, we can become visual thinkers. Firstly, multiple intelligence work done by Howard Gardner should have been very clear to the author that different people have different talents and not everyone can be a visual thinker. Secondly, cowboy clothes do not make one a cowboy; thus, not everyone who uses 3-D computer graphics can become visual thinkers. The second major theme of the author seems to be linking dyslexia people with visual thinkers. I don't see a clear proof in the book. <br /> <br />The author seems to branch out to many directions in this book and occasionally come back to discussions on visual thinkers. One of the strangest views suggested by the author is that cultures with verbal-emphasis are prone to warring with other nations. This is indeed a very peculiar viewpoint. The chapter on the Polynesian is also somewhat farfetched. <br /> <br />However, I do agree with the author on one point: that we need to develop some tests to measure visual ability just like we have IQ tests measuring verbal and math abilities. <br /> <br />To create a generation of visual thinkers, we need a societal change - education, cultural emphasis, jobs, tests, etc. Basically, we need to build up a whole system, starting with a clear understanding of how visual thinkers think; we then need to define or design tests that measures VQ (Visual Quotient) similar to IQ tests; at the same time, we need to train K-12 teachers on how to educate our next generations with visual thinking skills, along with verbal and mathematic skills; we also need to create jobs and compensation systems for these new skills, etc. The book did not cover all these areas. <br /> <br />I think the author is starting in the right direction. But much more needs to be done. Even with so many defects in this book, I still recommend this book to parents and educators. Our society need to identify and cultivate visual thinkers. <br />	2005-04-16

For the age that we are in, we need a whole new mind. However, the book promised a mansion, but ended up giving us an apartment. It begins like a Porsche, but ended like a VW Beetle. The author correctly diagnosed the disease of Abundance, Asia, and Automation, but prescribed the wrong medicine of six right-brain-directed (R-Directed) aptitudes. <br /> <br />To the author's credit, he is the first that succinctly diagnosed the major problems the Western countries are facing: Abundance, Asia, and Automation. Most people, including intellectuals and high government officials are in the coma state of not sensing the lethal effects of offshore outsourcing of high-tech jobs and R&D to the fundamental wellbeing of U.S. and other Western countries, nor the consequence of automating white collar jobs by the ever more powerful computer hardware and software. This is the first book that I know of that sounded the alarm to the great masses of the coming sea change. For this, the author ought to be congratulated. <br /> <br />The author has a vision that we are moving from Information Age to Conceptual Age. He said that if we have a whole new mind, we can have an economy and society that are built on the inventive, empathic and big-picture capabilities. He stresses that the main characters now are the creator and the empathizer. He argues that we need to move from high tech to high concept and high touch. These are all great ideas. However, the strategies that the author prescribed through the six R-Directed aptitudes, which consist most of the book, while adequate to battle Abundance and Automation, is hardly sufficient to overcome Asia. There are several major shortcomings to the book: <br /> <br />First and foremost, these six R-Directed aptitudes are not the sole possessions of the Western countries. Asian countries have them, too, and can probably master them just as well. The author seemed to forget to constantly validate his assumptions against the three questions he must answer. One of them was: Can someone overseas do it cheaper? This author has a dangerous underestimation of foreigners: \\"Sure. They can do low-level programming and accountancy but we still come up with the innovation and creativity.\\" He did not notice that R&D are moving overseas to the foreign countries. For this, see [...] for more detail. <br /> <br />Secondly, how does the author know that these six R-Directed aptitudes are the most essential of all possible right-brain aptitudes? He never showed research evidences for these aptitudes are indeed the most important. <br /> <br />Thirdly, the six R-Directed aptitudes are highly subjective, social-dependent and culture-dependent. For example, design is highly culture-dependent. What is deemed elegant and tasteful design in a culture may be offensive to another. A beautiful design to you may be an average one to me. Take another aptitude, story, as another example: the contents of stories are highly culture-dependent. A story that makes sense in one culture may not make sense to another. <br /> <br />Fourthly, the result of developing these aptitudes, if developed to the full extent, is the further fragmentation of our world, for we have divide ourselves into smaller and smaller subjective realms. A side consequence is the fragmentation of the market for goods and services. <br /> <br />Above all, the solution proposed by the author is not going to be able to solve the problem of \\"Can someone overseas do it cheaper?\\" <br /> <br />In summary, the author deserves 3 stars for correctly diagnosed the problems, but gave the very incomplete solutions. However, I would encourage the author to continue to search for the solutions for Abundance, Asia, and Automation. <br />	2005-04-07

So, after reading the book, you still don't know which schools to choose from. This makes it is very hard for a prospective student to distinguish one school from another. <br /> <br />2) The US News & World Report College guide - the rankings and ratings are done by college presidents and professors. Since when are college presidents heavily involved in academics? They are hired to do administrations and fund raising, not academics. If anything, they only have vague and general ideas of how other schools are. It is ridiculous to ask them to rank and rate other colleges. Much more, where are the inputs from the college students? Their experiences are the ones that count and should be a big part of any rankings and ratings. <br /> <br />3) Choosing the Right College - this book focuses on the curriculum and political atmosphere of each campus. But it is the outcome of an education that is important, not the curriculum or the political atmosphere. <br /> <br />4) College Board guide - this book contains only statistics and percentages - it contains no descriptions about colleges. It provides no critiques for colleges. <br /> <br />The descriptions in this book for each college are accurate and to the point. It relies primarily on inputs from the students. While this is very valuable, it could be greatly improved if feedbacks from the professors are also included. <br /> <br />There is only one guide book that is better than this book: <br />Getting into the Right College - by Edward B. Fiske and Bruce G. Hammond.	2004-09-13

The good ones are in this order, in my opinion: \\"Getting into the right college\\" by Edward Fiske and Bruce G. Hammond, \\"Cool Colleges\\" by Donald Asher, \\"351 Best Colleges\\" by Princeton Review, \\"Hidden Ivies\\" by Howard Greene, \\"Colleges that change lives\\" by Loren Pope, and \\"Choosing the right college\\" by ISI.<br />The best college guide is \\"Getting into the right college.\\" The most important concept in this book is that college searching is a matching process. You are not begging the colleges to accept you. You are trying to find the ones that match you. Too many students are selecting colleges based on their name and fame, and not whether they match the students' ability, personality, ethos, etc. This book sets the students in the right direction by firstly doing a self-survey in order to produce a set of criteria for college matching.<br />For students that want to reform the society, \\"Make a difference college & graduate guide\\" has the colleges and universities that foster and cultivate social activism. On the other hand, a conservative student or parent can use this guide to avoid the schools listed in this book.<br />Now, getting back to this book, it is a very good guide. The term \\"best colleges,\\" which is part of the title of the book, is not defined in this book. Even the author admitted that there is no objective standard in selecting these 351 colleges and universities. They were chosen only based on some experts' opinions. How should one objectively define a college as among the best? Certainly not the selectivity! For it only indicates the quality of the entering class of students. It does not indicate the transformational work that the college is going to perform on the student. How many of us judge a restaurant by the quality of meat it buys and not the food it serves us? Do we buy a car because of the quality of steel the car manufacture buys or the quality of the finished product? Is a movie rated by its star roster or the quality of the movie itself? Focusing on selectivity is only looking at the input. Instead, students and parents should look at the output, the finished products. That's what counts. The output of a college is its graduates. So, the real measure of a good college is the quality and performance of its graduates: What are the GRE scores of its graduates? What are their MCAT or LSAT scores? What's the percentage of its graduates obtaining PhDs? What's the percentage of its premed students entering medical schools? What percentage of its graduates are high achievers in the society?<br />Reed College maintains a web page which has the colleges and universities that have the highest productivity on PhDs: [...] High school students and parents should go and see this page. You will be shocked to find out that very few Ivy League colleges made the list. Instead, you will see some no-name schools that actually have done some wonderful transformational work on their students. For example, Caltech, Harvey Mudd, Reed and Swarthmore are the top four schools in the nation as far as producing PhDs is concerned. There is also an excellent report online that is done by Research Corporation: [...] If you check tables 1, 2 and 3 in this report, you will again see some no-name schools top the list for producing PhDs.<br />Again, getting back to this book, it is an excellent guide. It is full of useful descriptions by the college students of each school and they are pretty much on the mark. This book is good as a first filter. After you have selected some colleges you like from this book, then check with \\"Make a difference college & graduate guide\\" and \\"Choosing the right college\\" to make sure you like the social and political atmosphere on these campuses. Of course, I highly recommend Reed College's website and the report by Research Corp. Check out the top colleges in these two sources before you start applying to any colleges.<br />This book deserves a 4-star. I owned three editions of this book: 2002, 2003 and 2004. The content didn't change much from one edition to another, but that doesn't diminish its value. It has pretty accurate descriptions of the colleges and universities. The three sections I considered most useful are \\"Students Speak Out - Academics,\\" \\"Students Speak Out - Life\\" and the amazingly accurate sidebar \\"Survey Says...\\" This is the best first-filter book out there on the bookshelf!	2004-02-11

Even just some little tidbits of information can save you from wasted time, money, and a disastrous experience. For example, I am thinking about recommending my son to study abroad at Oxford, England during the fall of his junior year because Oxford is a world renowned school outside of U.S. Before reading this book, I didn't know that Oxford and most of the Great Britain and Irish schools are on a trimester system. My son's college is on a semester system. So, if he were to go to Oxford (assuming that he can get in), he would only be studying for nine weeks. The rest of his semester would be wasted.<br />Here is another example of a good tidbit of information: If a student were to study abroad during the spring semester, he or she should apply for financial aid (which is usually done during the spring semester) during the fall semester before going abroad.<br />One unique point about this book is that it also covers going to graduate school abroad. However, there were some shocking facts I didn't expect to see such as \\"Earning a PhD in the U.S. requires 6 to 8 years, while in other countries only 4 years are needed. One of the reasons is that students enter undergraduate universities at a higher level than Americans do. So, they are doing U.S. graduate level work by the end of their undergraduate degrees...\\" Wow, I used to think that our undergraduate system is at the top of the world. I didn't know that college seniors in some other countries are doing U.S. graduate level work.<br />I won't waste the space here and list the content or the chapters of this book. Suffice to say that this book covers all areas of studying abroad in great detail and in good logical order. There are many excellent advices in this book. They will give you a good study abroad experience as well as save you time and money! I highly recommend this book.<br />By the way, this book is much, much better than \\"Getting the Most from Study Abroad.\\"	2004-02-04

It lists many, many undergraduate and graduate schools that are strong in social activism. This book is a first-of-its-kind. There is no other college guide like this one, except maybe &quot;Lisa Birnbach's New and Improved College Book&quot; by Lisa Birnbach. Besides these two, there are no other guide books out on the market that tell the prospective college students and their parents about the political leaning and activism atmosphere of the colleges and universities.<br />Selecting a college is very much like finding a marriage partner. It takes a lot of effort to find a right match. Too often, students and parents are attracted to the selectivity and rankings put out by US News &amp; World Report, thinking that these numbers mean academic excellence. No, they are not. Selectivity means how good the students are at a particular school. It doesn't mean that the school teaches well. It just means that the students are good. There is no ranking of how well the professors teach. US News &amp; World Report never has such a ranking. Nor is there a ranking of how well the graduates of a particular college or university perform on job after they leave the school. Such a ranking would be the most useful, for it reveals the real and genuine transformation work that a school has done for the students. But no, US News &amp; World Report does not have such a ranking.<br />This book offers a very unique view into the colleges not seen in other guide books -- which ones are socially and politically active and are doing their best to cultivate activists for social change?<br />This book is useful to both liberals and conservatives alike. Conservative students and parents can use this guide to avoid the schools listed here. Liberal students and parents can use it to look into and apply to these schools.<br />Not all schools listed in this guide are of the same degrees or in the same areas of activism. Indeed, some schools are very active andsome are very mild in their activism. Also, different schools are active in different areas.<br />There are two reasons why I give it 4 stars. One is that I think the grammar and the writing style can be better. Another is that I suspect that some schools are not listed. For example, the famous UC Berkeley is not, nor is Macalester College.	2004-02-04

This book is unique among study abroad guide books because it lists 68 schools around the world that teach in English and offer American-style degrees. There is simply no other book like this one. You don't have to worry about matching the academic calendar system or the language used in the courses if you go to one of these schools.<br />A second excellent point about this book is that it tells you the level of academic difficulty of each institution by the SAT scores. So, you can find the schools that match you. A third excellent point: it tells you what each school is good at. Some schools focus on science and engineering, while others on humanities or business management. The fourth: this book tells you whether the faculty of a school is available for help and mentoring, or aloof and unavailable.<br />Other aspects described by this book are tuition rates and financial aid information, housing options, extracurricular activities, and support services, contact information and directions on how to apply, advice on staying healthy and staying safe.<br />I give this book four stars because I think it can be improved. For example, it would be helpful if the authors were to categorize the colleges by their level of difficulty, their similarity in academic areas, and their cost, etc. Also, I would like to see the section on the academic programs for each school be expanded provide more detail. Another suggestion is to include some feedbacks from the American students who have gone to these schools.<br />As for the steps and procedures to take for studying abroad, I highly recommend the book, \\"Study Abroad for Dummies.\\"	2004-02-04

The discriptions of the colleges are right on the target. It takes years of experiences and observations on each college to be able to provide such succinct descriptions.<BR>2) Chapter 1 - concerning liberal arts education - worths at least $10,000. Liberal arts education is the true enabling education for everyone, whether you are a humanities or science major.<BR>3) Chapter 2 - Sizing-Yourself-Up survey - worths at least $10,000 dollars, especially p. 14 -- p.17, which explains the results of the survey. When you have answered this survey honestly, you can then proceed to find the colleges that match you. This will save you not only months or years of wasted youth (when you are in wrong institutions or majors), but also tons of money. Much more importantly, This chapter emphasized the most important concept in this book: College searching is a matching process. You are not begging the colleges to accept you. You trying to find the ones that match you.<BR>4) Chapter 7 - Where to Learn More - worths at least $2,000 dollars. The authors provide a good brief description for each college guide publication.<br />The other chapters in this book are good, but you can find them in other college guides. So, in this sense, they are not unique.<br />Having read through a lot of college guides and done a lot of research on colleges, I can say that this is an excellent, top-notch college guide. This is an excellent all-in-one college guide. The value of this book far exceeds its price. Highly recommended!!!	2003-04-06
US	52638563	R18G0HVJ02F15	1570719578	307134985	The Fiske Guide to Colleges 2003	Books	3	27	28	N	Y	Good, but not excellent	I give it 3 stars because it will take at least two weeks of repeated reading of this book to be able to compare the colleges mentioned in this book. With Princeton Review's &quot;Best 345 colleges&quot;, it takes much less time.<br />As a consumer, I want to know what's good and bad about a college. I want a college guide that is like a Consumer's Report, that will test, compare and examine colleges critically. Though there are many college guides on the market, few examine colleges with a critical eye. The only good ones in my opinion are:<BR>1) Choosing the right college - 5 stars<BR>2) Colleges that change lives - 4 stars<BR>3) Cool colleges - 5 stars<BR>4) Best 345 colleges - 4.5 stars<BR>5) The Fiske Guide to Getting into the Right College - 4 stars<br />Since Fiske says something good about every college in this book, it takes a real detective work to find out what's bad about each college. I wish he points out the flaws in each college in a brief summary. For Harvard, the following would be a good summary:<BR>1) Very serious grade inflation<BR>2) Lots of classes taught by TAs<BR>3) Professors are as unapproachable as stars in the sky<BR>4) Large classes for freshman and sophomore years<br />This book is not as good as his other book, &quot;The Fiske Guide to Getting into the Right College,&quot; which contains a chapter called &quot;The one hour college finder.&quot; This chapter has a brief paragraph on the best colleges. Each paragraph is right on the mark. For example, concerning Swartmore, it says &quot;Pound for pound, the most intellectual school in the nation...&quot; With regards to Carleton, &quot;...the best liberal arts college in Midwest. Predominantly liberal...&quot;<br />So, my advice is to get his other book. Not this one.	2003-04-03
US	52638563	R3HYBQZI24IC7O	0761536957	189952375	Harvard Schmarvard: Getting Beyond the Ivy League to the College That Is Best for You	Books	4	58	60	N	Y	Much better than most college guides, but can be improved	A breath of fresh air among all the colege guides! It stands out in several ways: Firstly, the name of the book is very catchy (in a subtle Harvard-slighting way). Secondly, the whole book is an interesting read becasue the author intermiexed his advices with a series of stories, including his own and his children's college applications and college lives. Thirdly, chapters 13, 14 and 16 are the real treasures of this book. The information is not found in any other guide books.<br />The main messages in this book are three: One, you don't need to go to the Ivy League or the most selective colleges to be successful in life. In fact, lost of successful people come from no-name schools. Two, U.S. News & World Report misleads parents and students, which I couldn't agree more. Three, college selectiion is a process to find a match for you, not to seek prestige or recognition.<br />The list of 100 recommended colleges at the end of the book is also wonderful. A lot of these schools are hidden gems.<br />If this book is so good, why do I only give it 4 stars? Well, it is mainly because there are so few quantitative data quoted in this book to back up the author's claims. If people can be just as successful going to selective vs. non-selective schools, where is the research data to back it up? Why didn't Harvard provide the author a great educational experience? Are there research out there that showed how and why research universities have failed the undergraduates? ...<br />Do I recommend people buying this book? Absolutely! But I think it can also be improved.	2003-04-02

The extraordinary point about this book is that the twins research proved very decisively that nature is definitely the overwhelming deciding factor of our IQ, character, personality, etc., and not nurture. So, this book puts an end to the debate of \\"nature vs. nurture.\\" This is a book that is better than a thousand other books.<br />Before reading this book, I wasn't clear whether nature has more effect on human development or nurture. There are so many theories and arguments for one or the other from ancient to the modern times. After reading this book, I am cleared that the research results from the identical twins separated at birth showed that nature is the most important factor in our human development.<br />Why does a person become a carpenter, a plumber, or a professor? The enviroment may have something to do with it, but the biggest factor is his/her inborn traits/talents.<br />This is a book that must be read by all educators, politicans, social scientists, and above all, parents. We will save ourselves from wasted energies, financial resources, frustrations, and useless social engineering if we try more to find out what nature has given us. Please don't get me wrong. Nurture is important, but it has to be done according to the nature's gifts to a person. In other words, \\"Nuture accoording to nature.\\" We should nurture what is in the nature, not what is not there, or what is there but faintly.<br />I highly recommend another book, \\"Your natural gifts\\" (A new edition is published in 2002). It should be read together with this excellent book on twins.	2002-12-05

Highly recommended.	Read this college guide togther with books such as &quot;Colleges that Change Lives&quot;, &quot;Beer and Circus&quot;, and &quot;The Distinctive Colleges&quot;. You will see that the opinions expressed in this book is quite on the mark. This book should be regarded as a college guide to college guides. Plus, it tells you the representative colleges from each categories such as the scholarly colleges, the &quot;great books&quot; colleges, etc.<br />U.S. News and World Report's College Guide is pretty silly. It tells you how selective a college is. I.e., how good are the incoming students to each college. Well, we don't want to know how healthy are the patients that are admitted to a hospital. We want to know how much the hospital is going to do for a patient. Likewise, a college guide should tell us how much a college is going to do, educate, mentor and enable a student. Choosing a college is like buying a product. I want to know what that product will do for me, not how well I am.<br />Buy this book. It is highly recommended!	2002-12-02
US	52638563	R3SFPHQWP4Q5ZA	1559721316	109307286	A Question of Intelligence: The IQ Debate in America	Books	5	3	6	N	N	An excellent book on the overview of IQ and its issues	This is an excellent book for the understanding of intelligence and its issues. The author provides a good overview on the many aspects on intelligence, IQ tests and the debates around these issues.<br />In my opinion, the best part of this book is chapters 7 and 8. Chapter talks about &quot;Nature and Nurture.&quot; Nature is very much stronger a factor on intelligence than environment (or nurture). Chapter 8 talks about identical twins separated at birth and raised in very different environments, and after dozens of years reunited. Psychologists discovered that these twins have very similar IQs, personality, and characters. This proves that intelligence and personality are 'encoded' in our genes.<br />This is an excellent book for anyone interested in understanding not only about IQ and its debates, but also about why many social engineering prgrams failed.<br />In my view, intelligence is given by God. Those of us who have more should not be proud, because we did not sweat to get it. Those of us who have less should not feel ashamed. We all need to work hard throughout our lives and respect one another. All are precious in the eyes of God.<br />It is too bad that this book is out of print, but many low-value books are popular. I recommend this book to anyone who is open-minded.	2002-07-27
US	52638563	R34P3RLJRKRMRS	0465011063	2380127	Choosing Elites	Books	4	9	10	N	N	A facinating book!	This is a facinating book which affords you an opportunity to look into the minds of Harvard's admissions officers. This is about how they choose and pick students.<br />The content and research are first rate. However, the mindset is very much social engineering. I guess this kind of thoughts must have permeated Harvard.<br />Regardless of how many ways the social engineers tried, at the end the author admits that there are few indicators of success more studied and reliable than high school grades and SAT I scores for picking students. So, there is all the fuss about essays, recommendation letters and extracurricular activities, and yet they do not have much to do with student success in college and later in adult life.<br />What really scared me is the social engineering attitude among Harvard's administrators and professors.	2002-07-09

This is the only college guide I found that covers moral situations on different campuses.<br />There are several good points about this book. It is not filled with statistics. It has several good student-voted ratings like \\"Institution's interest in students\\", \\"Student's academic interest\\", etc.<br />One complaint I have is that it does not indicate how it choose the colleges in this book.	2002-02-14

What do you do if you have a child that is an A student? This book does not address this problem. P>There is a lack in this book, which is also common to 99% of college guide books. It does not tell you the moral situations on the campuses. Some schools may be very loose with drugs and sexuality. Some schools may have a rebellious culture. Some schools may have serious drinking and partying problems. Concerned parents may need to dig in many places to find such information.	2002-02-14

You should read it to understand what is going on in public schools. Much more, you should read it to understand what's going on in the college education. Your view on the current educational landscape will be radically and forever changed. This book will be a launchpad for you to do further research.<br />Every American should be thankful that this book is written. If I have enough money I would give every parent a copy of this book. This is simply a must-read. Other books that are in the must-read category are &quot;Dumbing Down Our Kids&quot; by Charles Sykes, &quot;Why Johnny Can't Tell Right From Wrong&quot; by William Kilkpatrick, and &quot;Profscam&quot; by Charles Sykes. Books by Samuel L. Blumenfeld are also highy recommended for understanding the current K-12 education ills.<br />Now a little bit of my personal journey: I first read this book five years ago when my children were in elementary and junior high schools. This book broke all my romanic thoughts about public schools. I verified with my children concerning the things mentioned in the book. My children confirmed that many things said in the book indeed took place in their schools. I was very alarmed at this. Because of this I tranfer all my children to a priavte school. I cannot allow my childern to be damaged psychologically or taught wrongly. My children are my treasure.<br />Read this book! Protect your chilren. It may be the most important book you read in your life, except the Bible. No book surpass the Bible, for it is the precious word of God!	2001-05-31

Just cross reference Loren Pope's two books--&quot;Colleges that change lives&quot;, &quot;Beyond Ivy League&quot; and you'll see that this books is right on the mark. The negative reviews for this book from the professors are not objective.<br />You need to check with college students and graduates to get objective viewpoints. I checked with many of my friends' sons and daughers who are or were in college. Most of them said that in 4 year colleges their are or were taught by TAs during the first two years (freshman and sophomore) of their college education.<br />I have a friend who is a high power research professor. He distains undergraduates.<br />Also, MIT has started a program to have college seniors teach college freshman. This is even worse than having TAs teaching freshman and sophomore.<br />This book is a must read for all parents and college-bound students. Don't be lured by college rankings--they don't tell you if professors teach undergraduate and how many of they do. Don't rely on your high school counselors. Do your own research. Your children are diamonds. You want colleges that will do the polishing work, not just admiring the diamonds or worse yet, letting the diamonds collect dust.	2000-12-11

I thought schools like Harvard, Yale and  Stanford are the best. I moved to Northern California to get close to  Stanford and Berkeley. Then, I read &quot;Profscam&quot; and &quot;The  Hollow Man&quot; by Charles Sykes and I was greatly disappointed in our  higher education (for more information also read &quot;Tenured  Radicals&quot; and &quot;Illiberal Education&quot; by other authors). The  Fisk's and USNews &amp; World Report college guides mention none of the  cancerous problems mentioned in Sykes' books.<br />The colleges metioned in  this book &quot;Colleges that change lives&quot; do not have the problems  mentioned in Sykes' books.<br />Now on the positive side, the 40 colleges  profiled in this book are gems. Mr. Pope has done a great service for the  parents, students, society and especially our country. He has done  excellent research. He personally visited these campuses, some several  times. Buy this book. Read it and tell your neighbors about it. Buy a copy  for your children's high school counselors.<br />In this 2nd edition 3  colleges have been removed: Bard, Franklin &amp; Marshall and Grinnell.  Three are added: Ursinus, Agnes Scott and Wabash. Also added are 2  sections: one section for Learning Disabled and another for  Homeschooler.<br />We all love our children and want to do our best for them.  It is important to find out what their natural gifts and talents are. When  they know what they are naturally gifted in they can make intelligent  choice about what kind of college profiled in this book they should attend.  Johnson O'Connor Research Foundation provides excellent methods in finding  out what a person's natural talents are.<br />All in all, this book deserves  20 stars!!! The best collge guide there is. And never let a small volume  fool you. It is packed with gems.	2000-08-18
