I see from reading the other reviews that many others also picked up on the fact that this is probably a new series , and not a stand alone work like \\"Ruled Brittania\\", hence my title to the review. <br /> <br />I would say that anyone who has read any WW-II history or who has seen \\"Tora Tora Tora\\" remembers that Admiral Nagumo hightailed for home before a 3rd wave was launched against Pearl Harbor. This novel explores the possibilities of the effects of a Japanese invasion instead of a raid. I have either read too much Turtledove lately or the author is losing his edge a little. Much of the plotline seemed to be telegraphed ahead. <br /> <br />Not a bad topic for an alternate history novel ; I hope that it doesn't get bogged down in the usual repetitive manner of the American Empire trilogy. <br /> <br />Overall, 3 stars. Could have been better , but I'm willing to give this series a chance.	2005-01-10
US	45563653	R1YP93FRGEAZIS	034545846X	464615514	Homeward Bound	Books	4	5	9	N	N	Finally!	Well , after a hiatus of several years , Harry Turtledove FINALLY got around to wrapping up what I thought was certainly his most entertaining series. The \\"Worldwar\\" series kicked things off with an good ol' \\"invaders from space\\" theme , by having the alien \\"lizards\\" come to the Earth in the midst of our World War II. All of mankind banded together to repel/resist the invasion. It took 4 volumes to finally reach an uneasy truce on \\"Tosev 3\\", (the Earth in Lizardspeak). <br /> <br />A second set of 4 volumes began with \\"Down to Earth : First Contact\\", and set the stage for a continuance of the man/alien conflict. The \\"Colonization\\" series really lacked the excitement of the \\"Worldwar\\" series , and bogged down after 3 volumes. The series really became very slow paced and , sadly , boring. Many of the characters kept popping up on the scene in highly repetitive scenarios ; i.e. Rance Auerbach/Penny Summers , the friendly neighborhood ginger dealers. They were caught (and thrown in the Lizard slammer) at least twice in the last 2 novels prior to \\"Homeward Bound\\". <br /> <br />The latest missive from Turtledove finally abandons the cameo views of some rather meaningless characters , and FINALLY forges on ahead by leaving the time frame of the 1960's , and very quickly advances to the 21st Century conflict(s). The main character really turns out to be Sam Yeager. The phrase \\"put on ice\\" takes a new meaning in this volume ; Sam is induced to enter cold sleep , and is reawakened in 2031 to take part in the Big Uglies mission to Home , the lizard planet in the Tau Ceti solar system. Many other characters from the earlier volumes are also iced : Atvar (Fleetlord of the ivasion fleet) , Jonathan Yeager , Kassquit , and Ttomalss.  <br /> <br />What ensues is the lizards are highly agitated over the Tosevite technological advances ; a new war of attrition is being contemplated by the Race (as the lizards call themselves). Sam Yeager , after his 50 years of clod sleep , is calledupon to become the ambassador of the USA to the race on Home , after the designated individual , the Doctor ,  fails to stand the process and is deceased. <br /> <br />This book bogs down a bit after the humans land on Home , but we have a little romantic interlude between Frank Coffey and Kassquit to liven up the scene. <br /> <br />Some of the excitement and suspense has been blown in one of the other reviews. I'm not going to belabor the plot any further. I will state that the author did a much better job of wrapping things up than I expected. At the outset , I wasn't sure that this would be the last word on matters. <br /> <br />I did enjoy the book. It is a must read for anyone who was pulled along by the series to this point. Certainly a much better effort than the other 3 volumes of the \\"Colonization\\" series ; I rate the overall effort a solid 4 stars.	2005-01-10

I received my copy of this book as an early Christmas present from one of my \\"stargazing friends\\". Even tho' I had glanced at this volume on bookstore shelves , I usually bypassed it for books on starhopping , star atlases , or other \\"hard data\\" type publocations. I now lament my earlier loss , and have truly enjoyed this very well written and extremely informative book. <br /> <br />The author , Timothy Ferris , takes us on a wonderful tour of the solar system and \\"near space\\" in the second section of the book ; he then moves on to the Milky Way and the wonders of gaseous nebulae , open star clusters ,globular clusters , and planetary nebulae within our own galaxy in section 3.  <br /> <br />Finally , in the fourth section of the book , the author deals with the imensity of the universe (as we presently are capable of understanding it) by moving on to galaxies , and galaxy clusters. <br /> <br />But it isn't all about the wonders of the Heavens , for Ferris intersperses some entertaining anecdotal material as well. Starting with a personal tale of how he became a stargazer-astronomer to passages about Steven James O'Meara and his phenomonal visual observing feats while breathing oxygen at 14,000 feet on Mauna Kea. We are introduced to Barbara Wilson , a mother and former housewife who excells in actually \\"seeing\\" the faintest of astronomical objects. <br /> <br />This is a great book for amateur astronomers at almost any level ; the author manages to communicate his passion for the skies and the fine art of observational astronomy in a warm and entertaining manner. It is an ideal book for a frustrating evening when the clouds roll in as the sun sets , thus postponing the observing plans of the day. <br /> <br />I rated this book 5 stars and give it my highest recommendation. No real warts on this one!	2004-11-23

I knew about Robert Hutchings Goddard at a very early age , and read everything I could find on his work. I happened on \\"Rocket Development\\" (published by Goddard's wife after his death)in a bargain book bin in 1956 ; after reading it from cover to cover several times , Goddard became one of my personal icons. I was sufficiently impressed by his accomplishments at the time to enroll as an aeronautical and aerospace engineering major as a freshman a year later.  <br /> <br />The present work , \\"Rocket Man\\" , was very disappointing to me in several ways. Although the author has done some homework , he missed the mark by failing to include a more technical slant to the volume. He also tended to focus on Goddard's foibles and weaknesses , rather than the formidable accomplishments of his life's work. A more technical description of the problems facing this remarkable pioneer could only increase one's admiration for this solitary genius. <br /> <br />A key point that may have eluded many of Goddard's biographers , admirers , and detractors is that the man was a physicist and not an engineer. It was pointed out that Goddard the man did not stick with the task very well and was subject to becoming diverted from what should have been his true focus. He also spent much of his time (in my humble opinion) more or less reinventing things , whereas had he employed a mechanical engineer to Provide some help , his accomplishments would have probably come closer to some of his dreams. <br /> <br />As an overview of the book, author Cleary does give much credit to Harry Guggenheim , Charles A. Lindbergh Jr , Charles Greely Abbot and the Smithsonian , all of whom shared credit for support of Goddard and his research program. Although the author seemingly has a favorable attitude towards his subject , the book lacks warmth -- tends to be a bit too dry for my taste.  <br /> <br />A decent work , but could have been a lot more interesting had some of the text and illustrations from \\"Rocket Development\\" , and possibly more photos from Goddard's archives been included. Only 3 stars from this reviewer ; recommended , but only in conjunction with a copy of \\"Rocket Development\\" in hand.	2004-10-30

After plodding through the previous 3 novels of the American Empire series , it's actually a relief to get into some action again. CSA president Jake Featherston begins what will become WW II by unannounced bombing of Philadelphia and a failure to declare war in the traditional manner. <br /> <br />We have the same tired cast of characters from the previous novel(s) , but the population is quickly reduced by the loss of Anne Colleton in an early chapter. <br />Actually , it is the character development that kinda' keeps me doing on this series--certainly not the pace of the action (tedious). <br /> <br />We pick up with Abner Dowling commanding the army in Ohio , with the assistance of Irving Morrell , attempting to blunt the barrel warfare of George S. Patton , the CSA armor commander.  <br />The main thrust of the war (and hence this episode) is the Confederate effort to end the war quickly by dividing the Union. Patton's forces quickly surge through Ohio to lake Erie at Sandusky.  <br /> <br />Jake Featherston offers peace to the Union , but President Al Smith rejects it and vows a war to the finish. At that juncture , Turtledove again bogs down with his character cameos and accomplishes very little than pad the book for his publisher.  <br /> <br />I guess that after 7 of these sequels to \\"How Few Remain\\" , that I'm getting a bit jaded in my view of the series. The books aren't boring , but they are certainly \\"written by formula\\" , and therefore are highly repetitive. I gave the present work a 3 star rating ; perhaps it might justify a bit more , but I'm getting tired of the SOS.	2004-09-07

Three years ago I picked up a hardcover copy of this book in a bargain bin at a local booksellers , not realizing that this was book #20 in a 20 book series. Although I enjoyed it , I wasn't really able to get into the story line very well , since the author had the habit of making clever asides referring to actions in previous novels. Now 3 years later I find that I have read 16 in the series. They must be addictive!<br />In this novel , which is set shortly after the triumph of the allies over Napoleon at Waterloo , Jack Aubrey and his particular friend , Stephen Maturin find themselves on the way to Chile under secret orders to assist the  Republican rebels in their efforts to break away from Spanish rule , locally enforced by the Viceroy of Peru.  The dear old \\"Surprise\\" has been converted to a hydrographical survey vessel to provide thinly veiled cover to the mission. <br />As a cast of characters , we are sadly missing Barrett Bonden , but have a new young face in the person of Horatio Hanson , the bastard son of the Duke of Clarence (heir to the British throne). We are given a brief glimpse of Bernardo O'Higgins , commonly accepted as the liberator of Chile.<br />Upon arrival in Chile , Jack Aubrey sets about building and training the nucleus of a new and independent Chilean navy , a daunting task. The action line is centered about the intervention of the Spanish Viceroy of Peru , and the Peruvian navy's 50 gun ship. Aubrey boldly devises a plan to neutralize the Peruvians , and basically succeeds in his mission.<br />In the line of personal involvements , Aubrey seems very morose and rather out of his usual sorts throughout the tale. Later , this is identified as \\"flag sickness\\" , or worry about being \\"yellowed\\". On the other hand , Maturin seeks the hand of the lovely Africa based naturalist Christine Wood. And in this vein , the novel leaves the reader hanging as to the outcome.<br />The unfinished 21st novel is due for publication later this year ; I am hopeful that we are able to at least see where the outcome of this fine series was intended. As a final sidebar--I suggest that the reader also consider reading \\"Sharpe's Devil\\" by Bernard Cornwell as a parallel to this book.<br />Even tho' this was not my favorite book in the series (Desolation Island or Treason's Harbor are the best) , I liked it  well enough to rate it 4 stars. I suggest what several other reviewers have also stated : that one should really read the series from the start.In that manner , they flow together more seamlessly.Recommend.	2004-06-09

After reading this delightful volume , I wonder why I ever stopped the series in the first place. The recent film release caused me to return to the series after a brief hiatus , and I am now enjoying it more than ever!<br />A brief synopsis of the tale--Captain Aubrey is given a task of suppression of the West African slave trade , with a hidden secondary mission: prevention of Napoleon's invasion of Ireland. To this end , Jack is given a small squadron of warships and is rated as the Commodore in command of the mission , with the clever and covert assistance of Doctor Maturin. Maturin's lovely wife Diana appears to have run away leaving a deeply troubled child in the care of others . In Freetown , the Doctor makes the acquaintance of the wife of the local governer , a beautiful young naturalist , and sets the stage for a future relationship in &quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot;.<br />Along the way ,in the course of the tale , we gain a further glimpse of 19th century life of an English gentleman at Captain Aubrey's home. I particularly delighted in the description of the astronomical observatory and Caroline Herschel's help. As an amateur astronomer myself , I couldn't help but smile at this inclusion.<br />Stephen Maturin's interaction with his young daughter is lovely and heartwarming , bringing yet another dimension to this already complex character. Padeen , the Doctor's manservant , manages to establish a relationship with the young girl and bring her out from apparent autism.<br />Commodore Aubrey fairly well crushes the slave trade and manages to make his rendevous with the French fleet on the coast of Ireland , as usual winning a striking victory. <br />All said , this is one of the best volumes in an excellent series. I enjoyed it tremendously and recommend it highly. Unfortunately the abbreviated battle scene only took a couple of pages ; otherwise it would have been 5 stars.	2004-06-01

I have read all of the &quot;Great War&quot; and all of the &quot;American Empire&quot; AH novels by Harry Turtledove , and I have just about had enough! From the novel &quot;Breakthroughs&quot; until this book , we have only had awfully repetitive cameo glimpses into the mundane lives of many characters who seem to have no redeeming qualities whatever. <br />In the present work , we finally wind up losing some non-essential personae: Nellie Semphroch(Jacobs) , Lucien Galtier , Laura Secord(Moss) , and Sylvia Enos. Some of these characters hung around waaay to long for my taste! We see Colonel Abner Dowling promoted to General officer rank and finally manages to get out of Utah.<br />Jake Featherston tightens his grip on the Confederacy and emulates real world Germany by the construction of concentration camps, and sets the stage for the upcoming World War II in AH time.<br />What I liked about the book:<BR>   (1) Gets rid of Nelly Jacobs.<BR>   (2) Starts to move towards some action in the next volume.<br />What I disliked about the book:<BR>   (1) Many of the statements made by the more essential players were not-so-instant replays of other scenes in earlier books.<BR>   (2) The dreadfully slow pace getting there!<br />Overall I liked this installment better than &quot;The Center Cannot Hold&quot;. I suppose I will continue the series , since I am &quot;hooked&quot; on the essential thread. Unfortunatly Turtledove seems to have trouble finishing what he starts , as in the Worldwar/Colonization series. I rated this volume 3 stars , but doesn't come close to 4. Still , not a bad read. Certainly beats watching paint dry , anyhow.	2004-05-23

I'll start out being up front , in that I am really a fan of the 1632 universe alternate histories. I have read all 4 books in the series. Unfortunately this one is a real bust.<br />The basis of the story is a mission to Venice is set up by USE President Mike Stearns to establish a trade relationship for the growing industrial power of  Grantville/Thuringia/USE. Stearns selects Fr. Larry Mazzare , Sharon Nichols , and Tom &quot;Stoner&quot; Stone to handle things as the diplomatic mission. Stoner also includes his three (behaviorally moronic) sons to accompany the mission. <br />Cardinal Richelieu has plans to thwart the Grantville mission and sends forth assorted nasty fellows , such as Michel Ducos , to inflict as much grief as possible on our assorted heroes (and heroine). <br />The planning of the trade mission is convoluted , seems to drag on forever , and is BORING. I normally have trouble sleeping in hotels while on business trips ; I took this book along to read in the evenings and had no trouble sleeping at all.<br />The plot to free Galileo from the clutches of the Papal Inquisition almost seems an afterthought to the general story line , excepr that Father Mazzere is summoned to Rome as Galileo's defense counsel. <br />Even as slow as this book is paced , it isn't all that bad. My initial take while reading the first 3/4 was either one or two stars. It does pick up towards the end and become fairly interesting. <br />Even though it is really different from the other 163X AH novels , all fans of this timeline need to read it to keep pace with all of the characters. Could have been much better , but sadly enough only a weak 3 stars.	2004-05-02

The setting is Northern Portugal ,1810. On Richard Sharpe's timeline , this follows  &quot;Sharpe's Havoc&quot; and &quot;Sharpe's Gold&quot;.<br />The story begins with a very unhappy Richard Sharpe--angry at his recall from a well earned leave with Josefina Lacosta , and by Colonel Lawford's replacement of Lt. Knowles with one of his relatives. Lieutenant Cornelius Slingsby (where does he get these names?) has become Sharpe's second in command of the South Essex light company by virtue of being Col. William Lawford's sister-in-law's husband. Apparently he survived a posting in the West Indies to become the husband of a &quot;lady in trouble&quot; , and the kind-hearted Lawford feels compelled to help his relative advance and become a bit more respectable to the family. Ah , complications!<br />Early in the tale , Sharpe manages to make enemies of two Portuguese brothers, one of whom is a Major on the Portuguese army , and his brutish brother , Ferragus. We are introduced to Ferragus through the burning of some stored food that was being clandesinely transferred to the French army pursuing Wellington into Portugal. Ferragus , an enormous man who was formerly a sailor , a slave trader , and a criminal , has managed to accumulate an enormous supply of food hidden in warehouses. Lord Wellington , however,is in the process of leaving scorched earth for the armies of  Marshal Massena and Marshall Ney , by stripping the land of food as he retreats behind the Torres Vedras line.<br />Of course there is a lovely lady involved ; a British governess to the children of the Portuguese Major , by the name of Sarah Fry. Also present in the cast of characters are Major Hogan , Sergeant Harper , Hagman , and Harris. As a carryover from &quot;Sharpe's Havoc&quot; Jorge Vicente returns as a Captain in the Portuguese army leading a group of riflemen a la Sharpe. <br />Ferragus , with the help of his brother , plan to eliminate Sharpe and his group by setting an elaborate trap , but as usual , our hero prevails. Not only must Sharpe escape to save himself and Harper ,but  rescue the light company from the idiotic Slingsby.<br />As in most of Cornwell's Sharpe novels , you can almost smell the gunpowder and hear the screams of the wounded and dying through his battle scenes. Fans of this series will not be disappointed this time! At the end , Sharpe and Harper continue to march on. Enjoyable and recommended.	2004-04-13

Having a lifelong interest in amateur astronomy , this book was a natural for me to seek out. I borrowed a copy from the library before I decided whether or not to make a purchase. <br />This particular book is one of the very few that I would recommend to a beginning backyard astronomer , the other being Phil Harrington's Star Watch. Both use a technique called &quot;star hopping&quot; to find the celestial objects of interest , and each has a particular &quot;style&quot; of doing so.<br />&quot;Turn Left at Orion&quot; uses a technique using the viewfinder field of view to move from an easy to find star or some other object to follow a path to the desired object.<br />What I liked about the book:<br />(1) A very good representative selection of deep sky objects.<BR>(2) Each object has an eyepiece sketch that accurately depicts  how the object looks in a small telescope.<BR>(3) A small scale star chart with the star hops depicted is included along with finding directions.   <br />What I disliked:<br />(1) The eyepiece sketches were simply listed as &quot;at high power&quot; or &quot;at low power&quot;. Some basic information about the eyepiece type , magnification , and focal length should be included to be meaningful.<BR>(2) The scale of the finder charts was too small , and better directions are needed to find some of the smaller and more obscure constellations ; i.e. Triangulum and Aries.<BR>(3) Having to take it back to the library!<br />Even though I have a few criticisms of the book , it is very ,very good. If I didn't already have Harrington's book I would rush right out and buy a copy.(They tend to overlap too much!) I give this a 4+ star rating , and if a few improvements are made in a later edition it could easily become one of my favorites to recommend and own.	2004-04-12

Seveal months ago I embarked upon an intellectual and spiritual journey after reading &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;. The topic of the sacred feminine and the true identity and message of Jesus was always nagging away in the inner recesses of my mind and soul. I made an effort to find several books that might tend to enlighten me more and this work by author Pagels wound up in my library.<br />Unfortunately this work seems to be somewhat obfuscatory and misleading. Yes , the author describes the discovery of the Nag Hamadi documents , and gives an adequate background of the history of Gnosticism , but I was not looking for a book review of the Gnostic Gospels , but for the original works translated. Pagels admits to having an &quot;orthodox Christian&quot; background , and tends to minimise the importance of the historic find. <br />Overall the book is valuable , but needed to include some rather lengthy translated excerpts from the original works to be taken more seriously.	2004-04-07

Although it has been to some extent superseded by the author's &quot;Star Watch&quot; , information is provided on a more exhaustive listing of objects. <br />The general impression one receives upon cracking the cover of this book , is of library quality rather than a &quot;field book&quot; , since the paper stock is of high quality gloss finish. I would use this book indoors to plan my observing sessions and use either photocopies of the star charts appended at the end of the book , or a field type star chart for outdoor use. <br />More classes of objects are covered in this volume than in &quot;Star Watch&quot; : galaxies , asterisms , star clusters , multiple stars , and quasars are all represented. Rather extensive verbal descriptions are included with directions for finding approximately 300 celestial objects , along with very interesting descriptions and explanations of them. The only criticism I have is that a few of the Messier objects are not included. <br />In a direct comparison with &quot;Star Watch&quot; ,  I find this volume to be more difficult to use. For a beginning astronomer , I would recommend this book as a follow-up project once the skies are familiar. &quot;Star Watch&quot; is a bit more user friendly for beginners. I still rate this work 5 stars and recommend it. The author has an excellent approach to finding and explaining celestial wonders.	2004-04-06

After finishing &quot;the Da Vinci Code&quot; , I was sufficiently intrigued by the topic to acquire some follow up reading material , and this was one of the works that seemed most relevant to the &quot;sacred feminine&quot; topic raised in Dan Brown's book. I also purchased the &quot;Gnostic Gospels&quot; at the same time , but have not made much progress on that front.<br />I read the entire book over the period of a week, and re-read several of the chapters selectively. The first impression one takes away is the individual chapters seem to be somewhat disconnected , but by the end of the book everything starts to fall into place better. Then a selective re-reading seems to reveal the true focus of this study. Those with a strong Christian set of beliefs will have alot of difficulty in accepting many of the authors' assertions , since a great deal of the &quot;occult&quot; information presented is , by traditional standards  , heretical.<br />The authors take a somewhat slow paced journey through the John the Baptist and Mary Magdelene stories , and attempt to link the Black Madonna shrines in southern France with the Egyptian Isis cult. Much of what is presented is conjecture , but a great deal of rather scholarly thought and logical eveidence is presented to make a compelling case for their hypotheses. <br />Later chapters deal with the Knights Templar , the Rosicrucians , the Masonic lodges , and the Priory of Sion (Zion). Reference is made to the &quot;documents secret&quot; found recently in France that indicate  the historical Grand Masters of the Priory of Sion were all brilliant and otherwise famous men in intellectual disciplines. Leonardo da Vinci , Robert Boyle , Sir Isaac Newton , and Claude Debussy are a few of the well known names included. <br />The authors also raise the issue of the Inquisition and the supression of heresy as a political matter. In the early days of the Christian belief , other groups were competeing for the hearts and souls of men besides the Church of Rome. It also  lends insight into the male dominated hierarchy of the early church , which felt itself threatened by the Gnostics and the cult of Mary Magdelene.<br />I rated this book only 4 stars based on the following : subject matter and content of the work 5 stars ; presentation in a readable form 3 stars. Not an easy book to read , but worth the effort : 4 stars overall. I recommend that this be viewed as a starting point for those truly interested in the occult or supressed religeous viewpoints of the &quot;heretics&quot;. It might just startle you! Just for grins , have an art book of Leonardo da Vinci's works at hand , you will definitely find it helpful.	2004-03-17

I was very pleased to see that authors Miles and Dobson followed up the entertaining \\"Fox on the Rhine\\" with a continuation of the story line to a more satisfying conclusion. <BR>At the end of the first novel , \\"The Fox\\" , Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel , has rather preemptorally surrendered to the allied army after the bridges across the Meuse were bombed by allied aircraft , stranding a large segment of the Panzerarmee on the other side without a chance of resupply.<br />In \\"Fox at the Front\\" , we are treated to the reasons for Rommel's prompt capitulation. We then see Rommel as a true German patriot , wanting to save his homeland from further devestation and subjugation by the Soviet Union. The other really central and essental character is US general George S. Patton , old \\"blood and guts\\" himself. Initially , Rommel's surrender order is obeyed by the elements of the Wehrmacht under his immediate control , but the agressive Obersturmbahnfuhrer Jochen Peiper of the SS prevents the forces under general Heinz Guderian from complying with the order. The SS divisions wind up attacking the remaining Wehrmacht forces , causing the emergency formation of an Allied-German alliance with the surrendered forces under Rommel's command.<br />Basically , the war continues : \\"German Republic\\" forces , allong with Patton's 3rd Army continue to pursue Peiper's SS forces through the Rheinpfaltz , and force the crossing of the Rhine itself in an effort to terminate the conflict. Enter the Russians ; Stalin sees an opportunity for an easy victory in the east , and hence breaks the \\"truce\\" earlier negotiated with Heinrich Himmler. <br />Many subplots and new characters keep the reader well entertained. Many of the characters from the first novel , such as Rommel's devoted driver , Kark-Heinz Claussen , find expanded roles in this sequel. Through many exciting twists and turns , we are brought to a rousing finish at the siege of Berlin -- a standoff between the Grman-American-British forces facing the Soviet juggernaut of Marshall's Zukhov and Konev.<br />My general \\"take\\" on this AH novel : MUCH better than the first effort ; the authors cleaned up their usage of the German military ranks , including the somewhat arcane SS ranks. The characters are not as \\"cartoon-like\\" as in the \\"Fox on the Rhine\\" , and are much more three dimensional. There are actually exceptional descriptive writing passages later in the book.

When Sir Patrick Caldwell-Moore had his list of interesting objects , 109 in all , published in the December , 1995 issue of Sky and Telescope magazine , it became an instant &quot;hit&quot; with the amateur astronomical community. The list &quot;mirrors&quot; the list of Messier objects in number , and offers a real challenge to neophyte &quot;deep sky&quot; observers.<br />The list compiled by Sir Patrick covers a wide variety of objects , as well as a range of difficulty that makes observation of all items on the list a problematic. Many of the objects are found in the skies of the Southern Hemisphere , adding some spice to the already great challenge. Included are some very attractive star clusters , really awesome bright nebulae , distant galaxies , and many &quot;planetary&quot; nebulae.<br />Author O'Meara has done an excellent job with this second volume of Deep Sky Companions , better that the first ; many of the objects will probably never be seen by many amateur astronomers unwilling or unable to travel to Australia or South America to see the South Circimpolar Caldwell objects , hence my title to this review!<br />As in the previous volume on the Messier objects , each entry includes a photograph , a sky chart (too small a scale!) , a sketch made by the author at the eyepiece, and an excellent textual description and astrophysical analysis. <br />This book is definitely a &quot;must own&quot; for every serious backyard observer. It is not without a few flaws : i.e. the scale of the charts being next to useless , and the somewhat over optimistic description of what the average observer might be able to see.<BR>Still worthy of a strong 4 stars. Recommended!	2004-01-30

When well known 18th century comet hunter , Charles Messier , compiled a list of &quot;confusing objects&quot; in 1774 , little did he think that the list would outlive his fame as the &quot;comet ferret&quot;. The list ultimately reached 110 objects that appeared comet-like in the primitive refracting telescopes of Messier's day. The first inkling that these non-stellar objects were a facinating collection of star clusters , gaseous nebulae , and galaxies was the work of Sir William Herschel , who was able to resolve many of these hazy and mysterious objects into clusters of stars.<br />The author , Steven O'Meara , has carefuly observed all 110 objects with a 4&quot; telescope from one of the darkest and clearest observing sites on Earth , the island of Hawaii , on the slopes of Mauna Kea. I really shake my head in wonder at the drawings the author has produced ; could anyone REALLY see these objects THAT well? I remain a little doubtful.<br />The book , nevertheless , has some rather small scale star charts to assist the backyard astronomer in finding these objects. Also provided is a B&amp;W photograph , along with an &quot;artistic&quot; sketch by the author. <br />One thing I generally find fault with in these &quot;observing guides&quot; is the level of optimism conveyed to the average user re: the visibility of the object through any class of instrument , whether binoculars , telescope , or the naked eyeball. I personally believe that really experienced observers wildly overstate what neophytes can expect to see at any given time.<br />With that little rant aside , this is still a book that should be on the shelf of any budding backyard astronomer. &quot;Four stars&quot; is really a gift on my part--realistically 3 1/2 stars , but one of the few up-to-date pictorial and reasonably scientific books on the subject available today.	2004-01-29

My take on the book is definitely positive , but it is really difficult to rate . There are only one or two contributions that are a bit wanting in clarity and enjoyability.

This is a case where the title pretty much says it all. This is a reprint of Henry C. King's classic , originally published in 1955. <br />The time span covers pretty much the beginnings of visual astronomy through the Mount Palomar 200&quot; Hale telescope. A particularly interesting era is the 18th century , with many notable advances made in glass manufacture and beginning of very large reflecting telescopes in the hands of Sir William Herschel. As the author moves into the 19th century , the names of Joseph Fraunhofer and Alvan Clark take center stage.<br />The invention of many other auxilliary astronomical instruments are also included in this fine work.<br />There aren't many other works for comparison , so --- 5 stars!	2004-01-21

Well, &quot;Killer&quot; McCoy , Ernie Zimmerman , George Hart , and &quot;Flem&quot; Pickering are back in action again! I really hate the long waits between the installments of &quot;The <BR>corps&quot; , but it usually is worth it. And &quot;Retreat,Hell&quot; is no exception to this rule.<br />The novel picks up  shortly after the Inchon Invasion has succeeded in a spectacular fashion , with McCoy , Zimmerman , and technical sergeant Jennings on patrol. &quot;Pick&quot; Pickering , General Pickering's son , has been shot down and missing in action as a carryover from the novel , &quot;Under Fire&quot;, that immediately precedes the current work. The patrol narrowly misses finding young Pickering , but manages to effect the capture of a North Korean officer thought by McCoy to be a high level intelligence officer.<br />Through many twists and turns of plot , evidence of Communist Chinese , intent to intervene in the war are unearthed by McCoy and Zimmerman. What really keeps us riveted to the book is the unwillingness of those of MacArthur's staff to pay any attention.<BR>The interaction of General Pickering , General Ralph Howe , and others with President Harry S Truman keeps us turning page after page. <br />It is not really my intent to give a blow-by-blow synopsis of the book ; it would spoil the outcome for the reader.<br />On my &quot;warts&quot; list , I only comment that WEB sometimes loses touch with the characters he has created : in &quot;Under Fire&quot;, Pick Pickering' paramour , Jeanette Priestly , is described as a &quot;lanky brunette&quot; , but in &quot;Retreat, Hell&quot;, she removes her cap to release &quot;her long blonde hair&quot;! Whoops!<br />I sadly miss many of the characters WEB introduced and developed so well in the WW-II episodes :Steve Koffler , Robert &quot;Easterbunny&quot; Easterbrook , sergeant Percy Everly , and Jim Weston. Perhaps we'll see these characters all &quot;returned to duty&quot; in the next installment. The Korean War isn't over yet , so there is still lots of potential left in this series. <br />Still my favorite series from my favorite author. As usual , I can't wait for the &quot;next one&quot;.

I have been buying alot of astronomy and telescope books of late--primarily to augment my new telescope. This is one of the better ones , since it is really much more substantive than the &quot;cheerleading&quot; books that are more useful at gracing the coffee table than the accessory tray of a telescope in use. The major plus feature for me is the format of the illustrations , which show the objects through a mirror type diagonal. Most , if not all , observations by amateur astronomers use this convention these days. The author goes into adequate detail on double star observing : measurement of position angle and seperation  are very well explained.<br />My only criticism is the assumption that all users will be using computerized telescopes , and completely ignores those of us who &quot;star hop&quot; by choice , and not necessity. The lack of star hopping descriptions downgrades my rating to a strong 4 stars.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-01-07

This is another one of Terence Dickinsons &quot;backyard astronomy&quot; books that is somewhat better than others of this particular &quot;genre&quot;, but suffers by a somewhat superficial treatment of the practical aspects of the subject. The primary reason I purchased the book was for the 20 very good star charts contained. It was not until I started using these charts that I realized that many important Messier objects were not included!<br />Although the pictures are wonderful , and very attractive , I buy books of this type for information--not to &quot;sell me&quot; on being an amateur astronomer. I don't need &quot;cheerleading&quot;. There are other books available that offer somewhat more information than this one--so 4 stars (more like 3.5 stars).	2004-01-05

Areas covered are both equipment and astronomical areas of study. This would be a really great book for a young adult or teenager interested in the field , but not terribly useful to an advanced amateur astronomer other than as a loaner to others possibly interested in entering the field.<br />I'm glad that I bought the book , but a little disappointed by the lack of depth and somewhat superficial treatment in many areas.

I have had a lifelong interest in astronomy;in fact it was ranked very high as a possible career choice when I was (a LOT) younger. After reading this book , it left me wishing that it had been available sooner. It stands alone in a field filled with &quot;guidebooks&quot; , for it assists both the rank beginner and the old duffers in finding some of the most beautiful and interesting objects in the heavens.<br />Let me state that this is not a children's book. It is not overly technical , but assumes that the individual using it is somewhat equipped for the hobby (obsession?) with at least a pair of binoculars , and probably is able to buy or obtain access to a small &quot;backyard&quot; telescope. For a properly equipped individual, this is a real &quot;guided tour&quot; that certainly stimulates the appetite for &quot;more&quot;. <br />The book is divided into sections that the author describes as &quot;near space&quot; and &quot;deep space&quot;. Near space consisting of the Moon and other Solar System objects ; planets , the Sun , comets , etc. , and deep space being all extra-solar system objects , such as double stars , nebulae , star clusters , and galaxies.<br />For me , the book was a great re-motivator. I found that I had never really &quot;lost interest&quot; -my interest was simply dormant , and for my part I must give Phil Harrington alot of credit. This is a soft cover book , so it accompanies me outside ; I make notes in the margins and have come to regard it as a friend come over to help me find new objects , an re-find things I could find many years ago and had forgotten.<br />I rated the book on the following points: content (information)-5 stars; readability-5 stars ; clarity of instructions-5 stars. It isn't a glitzy &quot;coffee table&quot; book ; it was meant to be used. So--5 stars all the way!	2003-12-04

This Civil War novel by retired navy captain David Poyer was certainly a good introduction to his writings. &quot;Fire on the Waters&quot; , although is heralded as the introduction to a three volume series , does much more than serve as a vehicle to introduce the requisite cast of characters ; it certainly gets  the characters in their places and definitely distinguishes the &quot;good guys&quot; from the &quot;bad guys&quot;.<br />From the start we are introduced to young Elisha Eaker , the son of a New York financier Micah Eaker , who joins the navy as an officer-volunteer. As he reports aboard the U.S. Navy steam sloop Owanee , several other primary characters in the drama to follow -- primarily Lieutenant Ker Clairborne , the executive officer , and Commander Trezevant , the Captain of the Owanee -- are brought into focus. The regular Navy men are somewhat taken aback by young Eaker , since the man appears to be in poor health as well as inexpreienced.<br />Eaker has volunteered for several reasons : to escape his totally domineering father and to either postpone or avoid an arranged marriage to his cousin , Araminta van Velsor. In addition , we find that &quot;Eli&quot; as he comes to be named throughout the story , is also suffering from tuberculosis!<br />Captain Trezevant allows Eli to sail on board the Owanee due to the political climate -- many of the lower officers on board the sloop have resigned their commissions and headed South prior to the looming outbreak of hostilities in 1861. The first real mission is a voyage to Charleston , S.C. in the relief of Fort Sumter. Eli amanages to distinguish himself to the satisfaction of the &quot;regulars&quot; and is accepted aboard and commissioned properly.<br />At the outbreak of war , many others leave the Union Navy and because of their loyalties to their homes and families join the Confederacy.<br />To reveal any more detail than this would belabor the issue and reveal too much that the reader should discover on his own. Altho I labored a little  adapting to the author's style at the start of this book , I found the novel to be highly entertaining<BR>and rated it four stars. Only a few warts on this one. Recommended.	2003-06-30

Although the basic mechanism of the time and distance transportation of a West Virginia town to 17th century Thuringia is pretty weak , once we get past that point the book improves a lot. On the plus side of this easy reading book is that the characters seem to be at least reasonably believable and likeable. On the negative side is the unlikely employment of the protagonist as a labor union organizer and the leader of the Americans attempting to establish a new style of government in Thuringia during the 30 years war!<br />I rated this book &quot;4 stars&quot; on the basis of a fairly good concept for a AH/Sci Fi novel but a very spotty job in execution. If the author were able to avoid some of the &quot;politically correct&quot; drivel it would have been alot better.	2003-06-08

In spite of being only a rather slim paperback , this little book contains enough clearly written and essentially accurate information to make it an excellent introduction to the problem facing young parents : do we vaccinate our children or not? Written in a very understandable manner and with very compelling evidence , I found myself wishing that this book had been available when my own children were young.<br />This book quickly reviews many of the common childhood diseases , the complications possible , and then proceeds to discuss the effectivness of the vaccines and their associated risks. Evidence is presented that the vaccines , although highly touted for disease prevention , are mostly ineffective and risky. The only reason I rated this book 4 stars instead of five is the book is TOO concise and some of the subject matter requires additional treatment. The evidence presented , however ,is very compelling , and I highly recommend this book.	2003-05-15

Bernard Cornwell just keeps getting better and better as these books progress! This is now the 13th volume on Sharpe's timeline, and the 6th in order of publication. The character development continues to improve as new personae are introduced in each installment. An especially appealing new character is the one-eyed and mutilated rifle captain , \\"Sweet William\\", who joins Sharpe and Harper in this highly entertaining novel.<br />The time is late 1812 with Christmas approaching. A renegade  army of British , Spanish , Portuguese , and French deserters have captured the \\"wife\\" of Colonel Sir Augustus Fotheringdale (what a name!), another of those rich and aristocratic and enormously egotistical bungling incompotents that seem to pop up regularly in these novels. Sharpe is selected to rescue the damsel in distress who is being held at an old castle and watchtower on the Northern border of Portugal , known as \\"the Gateway of God\\". He is provided by Wellington with two additional companies of riflemen and a batallion of Welsh Fusileers as reinforcements. Sharpe , now a Major , commands the rescue operation and manages to effect it with only minimal losses. The subsequent interference by Sir Augustus manages to result in the death of Colonel Kinney , the commander of the Fusileers , leaving Sharpe as the only experienced senior officer present. Also liberated is the wife of a French Colonel , who is returned promptly to her husband . The French seemingly have also mounted a rescue attempt , but only as a cover for an invasion of Portugal. Sharpe manages to uncover the scheme and settles in to thwart the French and brings them to battle , seeking to buy time for Wellington to respond.<br />There are many interesting twists and turns to the plot , in which Sharpe encounters his old mortal enemy , Obadiah Hakeswill , fights a battle , commands a batallion , and suffers a tragic loss. <br />This is one of the best Richard Sharpe novels ; not necessarily \\"the best\\" , but close enough. Five stars.	2003-05-13

In order of publication, this is the 5th book in the Richard Sharpe series , but the 11th in a &quot;timeline&quot;. As such , the author Bernard Cornwell has smoothed out his writing style to give Sharpe a lot more depth of character and a three dimensional aspect lacking in some of the earlier adventures. <br />In addition to Richard Sharpe ,Major Hogan , Wellington , and Patrick Harper , there are many interesting new characters introduced--La Marquesa (Helena) , Lord Jack Spears , &quot;El Mirador&quot; , and of course a vile villian , Colonel Laroux. All of these characters are artfully blended to achieve an exciting military adventure in which our hero Sharpe is gravely wounded ,and is rescued by his friend Patrick Harper. After being nursed back to health , Sharpe seeks his vengance against the man who wounded him.<br />The plot of this story involves a possible comprimise of the intelligence network of Major Michael Hogan and the possible exposure of his top agent , the mysterious El Mirador. Colonel Laroux , sent by Napoleon Bonaparte himself to destroy El Mirador , proves to be a ruthless enemy devoid of any honor. To reveal any more than this would indeed compromise the book's enjoyment for the reader , so I'll stop right here.<br />This volume seems to have it all--excitement,intrigue,romance,and of course the inevitable battle action! Of the 11 volumes I have read in timeline order , this one is right at the top of &quot;my list&quot; along with &quot;Sharpe's Tiger&quot; and &quot;Sharpe's Triumph&quot; for sheer entertainment value and excitement!

This is also the second of the novels to take place in India.<br />The year is 1803 and Sergeant Richard Sharpe is an assistant in the armory at Seringapatam ; his malevolent mortal enemy Obadiah Hakeswill is plotting his revenge ; Arthur Wellesley's army is preparing to move against the armies of the Mahratta confederation. All of the elements are in place for a great tale from Bernard Cornwell , and the reader is not to be disappointed!<br />The tale's start has Sergeant Sharpe lying wounded at a East India  company outpost which has been treacherously attacked by a renegade officer , Lieutenant Dodd , leading a company of sepoy deserters. Sharpe manages to survive the massacre and reports the events to the kindly Scottish Colonel McCandless , the chief of Wellesley's intelligence service.  McCandless , accompanied by Sharpe , sets after Dodd ,now a Major in Colonel Anthony Pohlmann's compoo ( an Indian version of a regiment) , a component of the Mahratta leader Scindia's army. Meanwhile Obadiah Hakeswill has schemed against Sharpe and has obtained an arrest warrant to aid in his plot to destroy and rob our hero of his riches obtained in &quot;Sharpe's Tiger&quot;. <br />All of these elements come together at the obscure Indian village of Assaye--the scene of Arthur Wellesley's greatest military triumph. In the course of the battle , Sharpe is commissioned an Ensign by Wellesley , and the career of Richard Sharpe set in motion. This is one of the very best battles in all of the Sharpe novels I have read so far (I am up to eleven to date); probably the best of the three &quot;Indian Chronicles&quot; .<BR>Highly recommended , and very entertaining.

The year is 1805 and Ensign Richard Sharpe is preparing to return to England in order to join the newly formed 95th Rifle Regiment. In the course of his preparations , he encounters Captain Joel Chase of HMS Pucelle at the home of a slimy Indian merchant who is attempting to cheat the two officers. The two officers become friends in spite of the vast disparity in rank , and their fortunes are intertwined in the course of this somewhat contrived tale.<br />Sharpe sails on the East India Company's ship Calliope , has an affair with the lovely young wife of an aristocratic English lord , encounters Anthony Pohlmann (who we remember from &quot;Sharpe's Triumph&quot; as the leader of the Mahratta confederation armies) , and falls prey to a French warship , the Revenant. In order for Sharpe to be present at Trafalgar , Cornwell has the Calliope recaptured by Joel Chase and the Pucelle and young Sharpe joins in the sea chase for the Revenant which culminates at the battle of Trafalgar.<br />The saving grace of the entire tale is Cornwell's description of the epic battle at sea! Even tho' some of the other writing is not up to the standard we expect from the author , it is more than compensated by the battle scene.<br />I personally believe this novel to be a bit of a &quot;fill-in&quot; novel in order to get Sharpe to another theater of activity. Not one of my favorites in the series , but still three stars-plus.	2003-04-21

On a time line with other Richard Sharpe books , this one would fall between Sharpe's Rifles and Sharpe's Eagle : May 1805.<br />This highly entertaining novel has Lieutenant Richard Sharpe and his sidekick Patrick Harper battling not only the &quot;Frogs&quot; but a mysterious British officer Col. James Christopher , an operative of the British foreign office , as well as a deserter from his own company of riflemen.<br />The novel starts with Captain Hogan , Sharpe's commanding officer by default , sending the riflemen into the mountains to  find a missing young Englishwoman named Kate Savage. It seems that Miss Savage has disappeared from her home in Oporto , Portugal , just as the French army under Marshal Soult is moving in to occupy the city. Hogan also asks Sharpe to &quot;keep an eye&quot; on Colonel Christopher for him. We are then introduced to Christopher as an arrogant and otherwise slimy member of the aristocratic English upper class who is in romantic pursuit of Miss Savage. As it turns out , the young lady in question is the heiress to one of the major Port wine producing lodges in Oporto. It also turns out that Christopher has other things than  Miss Savages' best interests in mind.<br />In combination , Christopher and Miss Savage lead Sharpe and his half company of riflemen on a perilous chase into the mountains of Northern Portugal , skirmishing with the French army , and their lives emperiled by Colonel Christopher's treachery. Sharpe has made common cause with a young Lieutenant of the Portuguese army , Lieutenant Jorge Vicente , and proceeds to train the young officer and his band of soldiers. <br />The battle scenes are classic Cornwell ; Sir Arthur Wellsley arrives in Portugal and sends Marshal Soult packing over the mountains back to Spain , with Sharpe , Harper , and Lt. Vicente in hot pursuit of the now treasonous Christopher and Miss Savage.<br />In summary , a very well paced and entertaining Sharpe novel. There are no dull or flat spots(unlike some of the Patrick O'Brian &quot;Aubrey-Maturin&quot; novels I have recently read). I just started this series a few weeks ago ; I am now a Bernard Cornwell fan! No real warts on this one--5 stars.	2003-04-09

I must admit that I found Patrick O'Brian's style a little different from most of the other authors I have been reading  recently. Not bad--just different. Conversations and manners of speech were alot different in the time in which these novels are cast than today. A big jump from W.E.B. Griffin to O'Brian!<br />After three books by the author I have finally gotten into a real reading groove and am beginning to enjoy this series immensely! This particular volume is an imperetive &quot;first read&quot; in order to really comprehend the flow of the series. In this volume recently promoted commander Jack Aubrey chances to meet Dr. Stephen Maturin at a concert and somehow manages to strike up a friendship with the somewhat eccentric physician. In fact Aubrey manages to convince Maturin to sign on board his new command ,Sophie , as the ship's surgeon.<br />Dr. Stephen Maturin is a true &quot;lubber&quot; as far as we are able to tell , and he is instructed in the sails of the ship by the bosun's mate in a manner that makes clear some of the nautical terminology later in the book. We are also introduced to the natural scientist Maturin--a role that develops in later books.<br />After running around the the Med chasing prizes and engaging in several nasty battles , the Sophie is captured and ultimately destroyed.<br />Any more detail than this would ruin the book for the reader!<BR>At any rate , I'm hooked now and will read the rest of the series. I'm already on book 7. Recommended for all age groups--something I can't say 'bout much modern literature. Only 4 stars since it is primarily a setup novel for a series.

Hajo Herrmann is perhaps not as well known as some of the great fighter aces of World War II on the German side , but his book provides a close-up first hand view of some of the more interesting aspects of that conflict. The &quot;style&quot; in which the story is told is hampered by the fact that we are reading a translation , and the &quot;style&quot; thus becomes the responsibility of the translator rather than the author. German is not an easy language to translate into a readable and literary form. Oberst(colonel) Herrmann embarked on a rather remarkable post-war career as a highly regarded lawyer in Germany, so I doubt his use of language and writing ability sould be questioned.<br />Herrmann , very early in his career , was close to many of the major figures in the Luftwaffe : Hermann Goering , in particular. In the first chapter of the book , Herrmann describes how Goering personally encouraged him to join the new infant service as an officer cadet. <br />The career of the author is virtually a roadmap of Germany's early triumphs. One of the most interesting(to me) tales involves his bombing of the harbor of Athens  in a Ju-88 and the sinking of a munitions ship in an explosion of &quot;near nuclear proportion&quot;. Also interesting were the descriptions of the battles against the PQ convoys to Murmansk over the Barents Sea.<br />But it was as the originator of the &quot;Wilde Sau&quot;, or wild boar nightfighting tactic that brought Herrmann both fame and earned him the animosity of many other highly regarded officers of the Luftwaffe.<br />I consider the book one of the best of the first person narrations of the former enemy camp. The author comes through the &quot;style&quot; problem as a real man of honor , and I would recommend this work highly to any serious student of military history.	2002-09-19

Tolkien's power with words reaches it's apex in this , the third volume of the trilogy. From the simple descriptions of the characters to the battle scenes , and Frodo's efforts to scale Mount Doom , the author brings the entire epic to life here in the grand conclusion of the tale. Anyone who can read this and not feel &quot;as one&quot; with the Hobbits has no soul and is devoid of emotions.<br />The book commences with Sam Gamgee believing that Frodo has died in Shelob's lair and undertakes to become the Ringbearer. Denethor prepares to defend Minas Tirith but seemingly has fallen under the influence of Mordor and attempts to cremate the still living Faramir and himself on a funeral pyre. The riders of Rohan are mustered and ride to the assistance of Gondor...<br />All in all there is much action leading to the victory of men against the hosts of Sauron. Meanwhile Frodo and Sam creep ever nearer to Cracks of Doom to destroy the One Ring.<br />Even though I originally read this book 30 years ago , I was once again entranced with the world of Middle Earth on reading it again. One of the few books of the 20th Century worthy of the title &quot;Literature&quot;. Much better than any of the later imitators in the fantasy genre.	2002-09-16

This was an exceptionally difficult book for me to read--not for the content or writing style--but for the subject covered. Vietnam was almost \\"my\\" war. I served in the Army at the onset of hostilities in 1964 , and lost many good friends there.<br />Many other reviewers have panned the detailed style of the authors ; I view the book as highly descriptive. I am not critical of style if the content is there , and in this case it IS! If a reader wishes to be \\"entertained\\" , then this is not the right book. The movie is much more compelling on an entertainment scale.<br />What does come through the dryly written text , however , is the belief of Hal Moore in the \\"duty , honor , country\\" aspect of military service. I felt a strong bond to him through the integrity he has displayed towards the men under his command. I , for one , would have felt honored to serve with/under him on the field of battle.<br />There are alot of other Vietnam war books that are much more excitingly written , but none of them describe a greater triumph of the American soldier under fire than this one. If you really want to know \\"what happened\\" , this is a must read.	2002-09-03

In this , the second volume of Tolkein's classic trilogy , the pace of the action really picks up! After a modestly slow start in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; , all of the major characters are in place and an action filled epic unfolds in a magical world best viewed in the marvelous images created by the author in one's own mind. Each reader has his own mental image of Frodo--of Gandalf--and of the despicable orcs.<br />After the fall into the abyss of Gandalf the Grey with the Balrog  in &quot;The Fellowship&quot;, we see a new and awesomely powerful Gandalf the White emerge (an almost Biblical resurrection , to make a comparison).<br />In this volume Treebeard the Ent is introduced , and the episodes of Merry and Pippin with the Ents are marvelously entertaining. The little folk , the Hobbits , show an unforseen inner strength that is one of the things I enjoy most in this tale.<br />The strength of will and devotion of Samwise Gamgee to Frodo is heartwarming. The segement &quot;In Shelob's Lair&quot; is one of the more genuinely scary parts of the book.<br />I probably shouldn't reveal too much more about what transpires in the story and spoil it for a first-time reader ; of the three volumes in the trilogy this is probably the most action filled and fun reading one , and is therefore my favorite.<br />If you haven't read it yet--what are you waiting for?!

I originally read the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy about 25 years ago while still in college. At the time it was all the rage as a leisure time read.<br />With the release of the movie we are now seeing a resurgence in popularity of the works of J.R.R. Tolkien.<br />As a work of fantasy , the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" stands out from the rest of the pack of would be fantasy novels like a Rembrandt  at an amatuer art exhibition. In this regard I have concluded that GOOD fantasy is extremely hard to write. There are alot of wannabe fantasy writers that simply attempt to imitate Tolkien (for the most part they just don't get the job done!).<br />The \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is the first book in the\\"Lord of the Rings\\" ,  trilogy and introduces the One Ring , or the master ring of power forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom. In the novelette that timewise preceeds this book , \\"The Hobbit\\" , Bilbo Baggins finds the magic ring and after a series of adventures , returns to the Shire and retires to a remarkably long life.<br />\\"The Fellowship\\" begins with allusions of a stirring of evil power attributed to a resurgence of the power of Sauron and the issuance of the nine dark riders , the high Nazgul , who are afield in search of the One Ring.<br />Gandalf the Grey , apparantly a jolly old wizard , comes to Bilbo's birthday party to provide fireworks ,  and convinces Bilbo to leave the ring to his nephew Frodo Baggins before once again going on the road for an adventure.<br />And thus begins an epic quest for Frodo. Gandalf arranges for Frodo to take the ring and depart the Shire , accompanied by his faithful friend , Samwise Gamgee. On the road to Bree , Frodo and Samwise encounter two other young Hobbits , Merry and Pippin , who also enter the \\"Fellowship\\" . \\"Strider\\" , as he is called manages to rescue the young Hobbits from the Nazgul at Bree ,  and becomes the guide of the group.<br />Along the way , many other amazing characters of Middle Earth are encountered , and many adventures transpire. Gandalf emerges as a mighty and powerful wizard , who uses his awesome powers to aid Frodo and his companions on the ultimate quest to the fires ofMount Doom , into which Frodo plans to cast the One Ring and forever destroy the power of Sauron.<br />In my mind what sets the entire \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy apart from it's imitators is the author's knowledge of Celtic and Anglo-Saxon legends and language. There is also a warmth to the characters , the Hobbits in particular , that is missing in other fantasy works. Frodo and Samwise exhibit reservoirs of strength , determination , and courage that is unexpected.<br />Altho' fantasy is not my favorite genre , I am rather fond of this particular work.

In this volume of the Corps saga , we see several of the characters introduced in &quot;Counterattack&quot; elevated to new prominence. Newly promoted Captain Charley Galloway becomes the commanding officer of VMF 229 , and along with Bily Dunn sets about preparing the young squadron to be thrown into the cauldron of Guadalcanal. Flem Pickering continues to grow in importance to the ongoing tale of incredible heroisim exhibited by the young Marines thrown into bloody conflict. <br />&quot;Battleground&quot; details some of the terrible privations experienced by the First Marine division on the 'Canal and the coastwatchers on Buka island. Steve Koffler and Joe Howard on Buka illustrate the importance of the little known coastwatcher organisation to the success of the Marine aviation assets in the Solomons. Koffler continues to grow in importance to the task of Captain/General Pickering in the Southwest Pacific Ocean Area (SWPOA). Even though Koffler and Howard are ill with parasites and other tropical diseases they continue to function &quot;as Marines&quot;.Koffler continues to emerge as one of the more &quot;colorful&quot; characters in the story--look for him in future episodes!<br />Of the many volumes in &quot;The Corps&quot; saga , &quot;Battleground&quot; stands out as one of the more lively and entertaining volumes.

This being the first book I have read by Patrick O'Brian , I struggled a bit getting into the  flow of the novel due to the peculiar Gaelic flavored writing style. In fact it took several starts over a couple of years to make it past the first chapter or two. However once past the somewhat slow start , the pace of the novel describing the adventure of the young parson's son , Peter Palafox , the tale progresses nicely. Young Palafox has obtained an appointment as a midshipman on Commodore Anson's flagship Centurion through the good offices of his father and the ship's chaplain. He and his lifelong friend Sean have several misadventures on the way to England to join the ship's company  and arrive just in the nick of time to sail with the vessel. <br />The maturation of young Palafox into a competent naval officer is set against a broad tapestry of Anson's historic 1740  circimnavigation of the globe , spanning over three years. The crew of the Centurion and the small fleet commanded by the commodore encounter fantastic hardships and outright disasters on an unimaginable scale , only to finally return home with the riches of the Spanish Main as a reward. Some of the best descriptive writing of the entire book details rounding The Horn into the Pacific--called in the book The Golden Ocean.  Hence ,  the title of this volume.<br />Other than an initial struggle with the somewhat complex writing style of the author , I enjoyed the book immensely. I still don't pretend to understand some of the Gaelic expresions and interjections , but I plan to continue reading some of the other works by this author.	2002-07-15

Yeah , I know that the first part of the story is a little slow...but it really picks up just as the &quot;hammer&quot; is about to strike the Earth and everybody tries to &quot;head for the hills&quot;.<br />The riots and traffic jams in L.A. seemed to mirror reality pretty well. I don't call the book &quot;racist&quot; since the authors' intent was in several ways predictive of actual events that actually transpired later (but for different causes).<BR>Remember, folks , that this is a work of FICTION. One of the precepts drummed into my thick head in my college English and various literature classes is that fiction often is a window into the world as perceived by the author!<BR>When the book was written , the times were pretty turbulent in Southern California. One could perhaps infer that the book was a societal warning. In the end , mankind manages to survive in spite of food shortages , a war with the cannibal army (reinforced with the National Guard!). The final few pages are perhaps a little &quot;trite&quot; about trying to restart a nuclear power plant and return the power grid.<br />This is a SciFi classic regardless of a few warts. It really is a fun read. It may scare the stuffings out of you , but it also may make you think about the truly fragile nature of our society and how thin is the veneer of man's behavior towards his fellow man.Even tho't is now a little dated , I recommend it highly even for younger readers. It never becomes as sleazy as some of Harry Turtledove's more recent opuses. A solid 4 stars.	2002-07-09

As usual I couldn't wait to lay my hands on the newest by Harry Turtledove. In reviewing/rating this volume I have rather mixed feelings. I read the entire book at one sitting until 5:30 AM , so it must have been compelling enough...<br />For the time line of the story we pick up the characters in the early 1920's. Jake Featherston is in the throes of rebuilding the Freedom party after the Whig president is killed. Abner Dowling is transferred to Utah as General Pershing's assistant.Irving Morrell is sent into durance vile for having the temerity to criticise national policy , and Anne Colleton continues to seek power (difficult for a woman in those times) and complain about the Confederacy's lack of leadership.<br />Other characters grow up. Others reproduce. Some die. Basically the book is an overview of \\"the times\\" that Turtledove has created in an alternate universe. <br />The careful reader with some historical knowledge will find both Adolf Hitler and the Marx brothers hidden within the fabric of the story , which I found to be amusing. There are probably others that I missed on my first reading. I will, as usual , read it again.<br />My major complaint with this particular series is the dreadfully slow pace due to the microscopic focus on the mundane lives of some fairly inconsequencial individuals; perhaps Turtledove has bigger things planned for Scipio and Anne Colleton later on , but WHEN? <br />I intend to continue reading this series just to see how it turns out. Overall impression: good but not great ; needs to speed up the pace A LOT! Sadly only 3 stars when it could have been more if it covered more ground at a somewhat faster rate!	2002-07-02

This,the third volume in the Corps series,must be regarded as a convenient stepping stone to later episodes. We are introduced to sergeant/lieutenant Joe Howard , &quot;big Steve&quot; Oblensky, Charley Galloway , Jake Dillon , and a more vivid portrait off Jack NMI Stecker. Fleming Pickering emerges as a central character in the role of Frank Knox's &quot;spy&quot; in the Pacific. Flem Pickering is commissioned as a reserve Captain  in the Navy , sent to be the eyes and ears of the Secretery of the Navy Australia , and becomes a friend of Douglas MacArthur. We also are introduced to Steve Koffler through an interplay with the series most detestable character , Robert Macklin , at Lakehurst Naval Air Station. The action centers on planning and execution of the invasion of Guadalcanal and Gavutu islands in the Solomon chain.<br />Overall the plot proceeds at a reasonable pace , but this volume is primarily setting up some of the later books through the Griffin trademarked character development. If one is a fan (as I am) of this genre , then this is an intresting &quot;must read&quot; even tho' it is one of the least exciting books in the Corps saga.	2002-02-01

It was well worth waiting for this,possibly the best,installment in Griffin's flagship series.<br />The novel picks up in June,1950 , just prior to the outbreak of the Korean War. &quot;Pick&quot; Pickering is an airline Captain flying Lockheed Constellation aircraft to the Orient for the new airline subsidiary of Fleming Pickering's P&amp;FE shipping company.<BR>Captain Ken McCoy and Ernie Sage McCoy are living in Japan,where McCoy is an intelligence officer. McCoy has written an analysis of North Korean intentions that displeases the sycophantic members of General Douglas MacArthur's &quot;Bataan Gang&quot;that almost results in McCoy's involuntary separation from the Marine Corps. During a visit to the McCoy residence in Japan,Fleming Pickering learns of McCoy's problem and initiates a series of events which,upon the outbreak of hostilities in Korea,results in General Pickering being recalled to active duty.<br />Other major characters from the previous novels,Ed Banning,Bill Dunn,George Hart,and the faithful Ernie Zimmerman all have significant roles to play in the action that follow. In particular,Ernie Zimmerman's character is greatly expanded from some of the cretinous treatment in some of the middle novels in the series.<br />The book is well paced with more action than in several of the more recent installments.The action centers on McCoy and Zimmerman conducting a clandestine operation to prepare the way for MacArthur's famous Inchon invasion. I don't wish to spoil things for any other readers by going into further detail.<br />This is a great read--I read the whole thing at one sitting--and couldn't put it down.I'm sure there will be atleast one more Korean war installment in the series.Griffin always leaves me wanting MORE!! I only hope that we see less time between Corps novels in the future. Five stars all the way!!	2002-01-15

In this,the sixth volume of The Corps series,Griffin seems to have all of his characters introduced and is now starting to utilise them in some action. The novel picks up at Henderson Field on Guadalcanal with Billy Dunn and VMF-229. The Marines are hanging on to the field (and the island) by a thread. After several battles in which the Japanese are soundly defeated,our heroes (Dunn , Jake Dillon , McCoy,Zimmerman,and &quot;the Easterbunny&quot;) are all returned to the States. We see an expansion of Jake Dillon's role as the tour director for a War Bond tour featuring the Guadalcanal Aces and Ken McCoy's idiot brother Tommy.<br />The novel introduces the Guerrilla potential of Wendell Fertig on Mindinao and also the problem of the Gobi desert weather station required by the Navy and sets up the next two novels in the series,which I happen to like better than this particular episode.<br />I gave this particular installment 4 stars based on the character development of many of the minor characters in the series. Griffin really brings people to life--I feel as though I KNOW some of these individuals in real life. I do get a bit bored at times with &quot;Pick&quot; Pickering's poor little rich boy behavior,and some of the Scotch guzzling scenes get on my nerves.<BR>In spite of these few warts,I really enjoy these books as much as any I have read. Perhaps if Griffin had given us a little more firsthand smell of gunpowder and sped things up a little more I would have rated the book 5 stars. Overall highly recommended!	2001-12-24

W.E.B. Griffin's writing style was really evident at the time--too unique and &quot;salty&quot; to imitate. Now that the series is in print under the Griffin name I am wondering whether he plans to continue the the plot to a time-line conclusion. In this , the fourth volume of the O.S.S. saga , the major character Richard Cannidy , plans and executes the extraction of Eric Fulmar , Gisella Dyer , and Professor Dyer from Hungary. As a separate counter-plot , Captain Jim Whittaker returns to the Phillipines with aid for &quot;General&quot; Wendell Fertig who is attempting to conduct operations against the Japanese on the island of Mindinao. These operations are set against the background of the machinations of the O.S.S. hierarchy , the sexual/bedroom antics of the protagonists , and an episode of &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot;. I particularly liked Commander John Dolan as a character , and the cameo of Joe Kennedy Jr. seemed correct. In this series , tho' W.E.B. tries to compress alot of subplots into far too little space to be satisfying. If this is the end of the series , then the author needs to concentrate on The Corps , which I consider to be his &quot;Flagship&quot; series. The Wendell Fertig story was fleshed out pretty well in &quot;Behind the Lines&quot;.<BR>On the other hand , one more volume in &quot;Men at War&quot; could conclude this particular timeline in a satisfying manner.<BR>Overall this particular volume was an enjoyable read ; not one of W.E.B.'s very best , but good enough for 4 stars.	2001-08-29

Standartenfuehrer Leon Degrelle has written a very insightful history of an era that is little known by the average reader. Most of the &quot;mainstream&quot; histories of the events leading up to the &quot;Great War&quot; do not delve into the duplicity of the French and the close relationship between the Tsar of Russia and the Kaiser. The post war era is all but ignored by historians , but Europe was in turmoil with Red revolutions breaking out in Bavaria and Hungary! Author Degrelle paints vivid word-pictures of many of the major players of the era ; he personally knew many of them and was himself a major political figure in his native Belgium.<br />This is an easy read since many of the chapters are relatively short. An easy book to finish , since it may be picked up and continued without losing track of the events. Interesting!	2001-08-29

In this case I was sadly disappointed. Other reviewers have already summarized the plot and time line of events and made their (favorable?!) comments. In some cases I wondered if we were all reading the same book. <br />Dr. Turtledove has a marvelous gift for bringing average and not-so-average people to life through his writing style with his anecdotal/cameo approach. In this particular installment of the Great War series , that is about all we get--cameo after cameo. The plot seems to be very shallow and the emphasis is centered on the rather mundane doings of alot of the central characters introduced in the earlier novels. <br />In the earlier books in the series there was some electricity to the plot and some real excitement that is totally lacking in the &quot;Blood and Iron&quot; novel. I found this to be rather tedious and a less than easy book to finish. I did't stay up 'till the wee hours reading as I normally do with a new novel. I wouldn't go to the extent of saying &quot;don't bother&quot; but it comes pretty close. If you are intending to continue reading the series , it is a must read just to keep track of the major players. I rated it 2 stars , but just barely.

I enjoyed reading this little paperback by Edward Cooper , and found the scientific/engineering basis for the plot to be very innovative! In a nutshell, Germany , by using advanced technology , defeats the Allies. Starting at the time of the Normandy invasion , nuclear weapons are used to devastate the beach head and drive Great Britian from the war. The U.S. &quot;goes it alone&quot; for a while until Germany manages to inflict a crushing defeat on the armies of Marshall Timeshenko , and the Soviet Union sues for peace after Stalin is assassinated.  Many novel twists and turns of events lead to Field Marshall Erwin Rommel becoming chancellor of Germany and an unusual conclusion to the story. For his creativity , I gave the author 4-stars plus.<br />Now the down side to the book. Mr. Cooper probably flunked German 101 in college--his spelling and word useage is positively terrible. The author can't seem to keep the spelling of the names of very famous (or infamous) characters straight even on the same page. A competent editor or proofreader would have helped this book enormously and upgraded my rating substantially. I gave the author a benefit of the doubt with 4 stars , but 3.5 stars would be more accurate. Overall--recommended.	2001-05-07

This is the first volume of eight in &quot;The Corps&quot; series by W.E.B.Griffin , and is probably one of the best volumes. It is without doubt a wonderful intro to the writings of Mr. Griffin.<br />The setting of the novel is Shanghai, China in early 1941 , before the onset of U.S. involvement in the hostilities known as World War II. We are first introduced to corporal Kenneth McCoy , a bright 21 year old Marine who has just &quot;shipped over&quot; for a second enlistment in the Marine Corps. After McCoy defends himself from the assault by a group of Italian Marines , by skillful use of a knife , he becomes known as &quot;Killer&quot; McCoy. Captain Edward Banning enters the series as the intelligence officer of th 4th Marines assigned to help McCoy as his defense officer at a Court Martial for killing the Italians. After &quot;Killer&quot; McCoy is cleared , Banning enlists Ken as an assistant in collecting intelligence on the Japanese army that is occupying China. Sergeant Ernest Zimmerman is a motor pool NCO who operates convoys to various Marine installations in the vicinity of Shanhai ; McCoy is subsequently assigned to the convoys to collect information for Banning , using his lowly status for cover. The Japanese provoke another incident wherin McCoy kills a number of &quot;Chinese baandits&quot; with Zimmerman , which results in his transfer back the the U.S.<br />Unbeknownst to McCoy , he was selected by Captain Sessions , who met Ken on the convoys ,to be run through an officers's course at Quantico. While at Quantico, Ken meets Malcom &quot;Pick&quot; Pickering who continues to play a major role in later novels, as well as his romantic interest in the person of Earnestine &quot;Ernie&quot; Sage.<br />As one may have concluded at this point , the volume is crucial to anyone contemplating reading any of the later episode in the series , since almost all the major characters are introduced in &quot;Call to Arms&quot;.<br />I have read this book 3 or 4 times over a ten year period and  never tire of it. Well written with excellent character development. Briskly paced with good continuity. All in all--one of my favorite books. Five stars plus!	2001-05-07

The authors of this Alternate History have done a pretty fair job of tilling some virgin ground--World War II has not been explored or exploited as the basis of very many books in the AH genre thus far.<br />Overall the plot seems pretty plausible;the assassination of Adolf Hitler by Claus von Stauffenberg and his co-conspirators ends in chaos,leading to Heinrich Himmler becoming the new Fuehrer. At the time (1944) all seems to be lost for Germany;the Allies are bombing the Reich to rubble and both fronts are on the verge of collapse. Heinrich Himmler scores a diplomatic coup by concluding a peace treaty with the Soviet Union,and an injured Field Marshall Rommel is recalled to duty as the commander in the West. Rommel subsequently conducts a brilliant fighting retreat to the &quot;Westwall&quot; or Siegfried line while Adolf Galland,the brilliant General of Fighters, conducts his long planned &quot;grosse schlag&quot; or big blow against the American 8th Air Force with the revolutionary Me 262 jet fighters. The book title &quot;Fox on the Rhine&quot; is the code name for the alternate history version of the Battle of the Bulge led in this instance by Rommel.<br />Many fictional characters are introduced in the course of action, some of whom are not very believable. Oberst (Colonel) Krueger seems to be a pretty vile individual to be selected by General Galland as a wing commander. Krueger's behavior towards his crew chief borders on idiotic , since the mechanics are what kept the pilots alive in the air through thorough and careful maintenence of the aircraft. On the other hand Feldwebel (sergeant) Karl-Heinz Claussen was a thoroughly likeable sort of fellow.<br />My overall impression of the book was very favorable,although I was somewhat let down by the ending. It seemed to me that the failure of the great Ardennes offensive was based on an somewhat improbable scenario in Dinant, and based on all the previous actions taken by Rommel this ending would not have occurred.<br />On the negative side , the book needed a lot more thorough job of proofreading. Several small nitpicking errors were carried through the entire book; i.e. there is no &quot;d&quot; in Messerschmitt! Captains in the S.S. are not &quot;Hauptmann&quot; but &quot;Obersturmfuehrer&quot;;and tanks are not steered by steering wheels,although half tracks are.<br /> A better knowledge of German and German forms of address to superiors (not &quot;Feldmarshall&quot; , but &quot;Herr General Feldmarshall&quot;) would have helped smooth out a few of the rough spots and upgraded this book to &quot;5 stars&quot;.In the realization that this was the first AH book attempted by these authors, I look forward to even better efforts in the future.	2001-04-08

Kurt &quot;Panzer&quot; Meyer was undoubtedly one of the more incredible military figures of World War II , and I was indeed fortunate to obtain an English translation of his autobiography. The writing style is very stacatto and direct,with short chapters; the effect tends to be riveting and the descriptions of combat are heightened by this style.<br />I found Meyer's exploits in the Balkans and in Russia as a Panzer recon group commander to be &quot;textbook&quot; examples of audacity! As the commanding officer of the Recon Batallion of the Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler in the Balkan campaign,Meyer siezed Greek fishing boats, loaded on his troops and some armored cars , and performed an amphibious end run around the retreating British army , resulting in his award of the Knights Cross. With the dictum &quot;the motor is a weapon&quot; familiar to his troops , Meyer gave real meaning to the definition of &quot;Blitzkreig&quot;.<br />Panzermeyer assumed command of the 12th Waffen S.S. Panzer division in Normandy upon the death of the division commander. Meyer describes the young men of the Hitlerjugend division in glowing and heroic terms; these young men were actually just boys--doing a job most grown men would fear. The Oak leaves and Swords to the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross awarded to Meyer were modestly attributed to his heroic men/boys.<br />Meyer was subsequently captured by the Canadian army , and Meyer was tried for war crimes. Meyer was a convenient scapegoat in the postwar hanging spree. His execution was later commuted to a life in prison sentence , and his release was later arranged through the Catholic church after 10 years of imprisonment.<br />The book is on my &quot;must read&quot; list for anyone desirous of a glimpse of the war from one of the truly exciting and outstanding officers of the Waffen S.S. This is not a work of fiction , and it is not highly polished by professional ghostwriters. It is not an easy task to find an English translation ,but it is well worth the effort!	2001-03-30

Adolf Galland was one of the truly outstanding heroes of W.W.II. regardless of the side one which he served. As an individual he developed quite a large &quot;cult&quot; following in aviation circles and was a very popular speaker. His book was one of the first wartime memoirs published by a high ranking officer of the former enemy camp. General Galland does not go into alot of detail in regards to his &quot;dogfights&quot;;not that he was too self-effacing,but that he was a pilot of consummate skill and many of his victories were fairly easy. (Galland held many prewar gliding records for time aloft!) When you are the best,you don't need to brag!<br />What sets this volume apart from many of the later wartime histories is the unique position the author attained,and the descriptions derived from personal contact with many of the leaders of the Third Reich. Galland is analytical--not apologetic--in his comments on the reasons for Germany's loss to the Allies. <br />If W.W.II history is your &quot;thing&quot; , then this is your book. Other reviewers have criticized the &quot;wooden&quot; writing style,but German is not the easiest language to translate into &quot;literary&quot; English. Put aside your quibble about style and read it for CONTENT and enjoy a view of recent history from one who actually made it. Five stars all the way.	2001-03-29

Although Harry Turtledove is one of my more favorite authors and is capable of being truly spellbinding , this book was a real chore to finish. Rather than an Alternate History , one might better describe it as an Alternate Outcome--the American Revolution never occurred! <br />I didn't believe that this alternate outcome was at all possible given the conditions in 1775 America and the nature of the personalities involved ; the force of personality in Patrick Henry , Thomas Jefferson , and Tom Paine was entirely too strong for this outcome , wherin Americans would still be bowing and scraping before a King. For me to &quot;buy into&quot; an Alternate History or , in this case an alternate outcome , there must be a finite plausibility. <br />The mystery aspect of the theft of the painting known as &quot;The Two Georges&quot; is about all that kept me going in this book. Dr. Turtledove and Richard Dreyfuss did a fair job of portraying an alternate America , but the book WAS waaay too long! The pace of the action was tedious and verging on boring. <br />Not one of Turtledove's better efforts. Two stars is fair.	2001-03-18

Although I felt somewhat misled (as usual) by the cover of the book showing Romans in Panzers,I was not too displeased with the content. This little volume would make a fine travelling companion,since most of the short stories take only a little time to read and they all &quot;stand alone&quot;. Hence a good book for a commuter or someone taking a short regional hop.<br />As with most anthologies,the contents of the book covers alot of territory. I particularly liked &quot;Vati&quot;,since I am not only an aviation buff,but also a serious student of W.W.II. The concept of Werner Moelders leading the Luftwaffe was great,for at the time of his real-time death he was the leading &quot;ace&quot; in the European Theatre of war. Of the other alternate history short stories , I thought &quot;A Hard Day for Mother&quot;,&quot;Billy Mitchell's Overt Act&quot; , and &quot;Craft of War&quot; all had particular merit. Several of the others were somewhat &quot;forgettable&quot;.<br />To enjoy the genre of alternate history , one should be fairly well versed in &quot;real-time&quot; history , or many of the stories dealt with in this book will fall on barren ground. Most people will not have heard of Christopher Craddock , for example. Instead of vanquishing the German battlecruiser &quot;Goeben&quot; as he accomplished in the story , he actually went to a sailors's grave at the hands of von Spee's armoured cruisers at Coronel!<br />It is exceedingly difficult to give a book such as this a &quot;star&quot; rating since a few of the stories contained would themselves rate 5 stars while others are far less meritorious. To simplify matters , I would give this book a &quot;worth buying&quot; or a &quot;thumbs up&quot; , as opposed to a negative rating.	2001-03-09

I received a copy of this little paperback as a &quot;loaner&quot; from a friend who wanted my opinion of it. As a professional scientist,I approached this volume as objectively as possible,looking for flaws in reasoning and logical failures. I found none.<br />I am sure that political &quot;Liberals&quot; and those who choose to be thought&quot;Politically Correct&quot; will uniformly hate this work,since it pretty well dumps on one of their sacred cows:diversity. Mr. Chittum has compiled some pretty interesting statistics on political/social stability in a number of different countries and sets up a model for analysis;i.e. Nation vs. Empire. In a logical sense,one needs to examine the premises that are stated;are they correct or not? If the premises are not flawed and the reasoning sound,then it is pretty hard to dispute the conclusion.<br />Mr. Chittum's main premise is that the racial demographics of the U.S.A. are changing. Fact or Fiction? The most recent census figures show this a FACT.<br />Another premise is that as the demographics change,the various groups involved become more polarized and militant. Mr. Chittum publishes an impressive list of racially concious militant groups, and not very many of which are &quot;white-power&quot; groups. <br />The Conclusion arrived at by the author,based on comparisons with other countries, is that some form of open conflict is inevetible in the future. <br />I found this book to be very thought-provoking and rather disturbing;I would rather be &quot;disturbed&quot; than blind sided. Ignore this book &quot;at your own risk&quot;. Although I do not agree with the author on a few of his suggestions on what to do in preparation for Civil War II, I give him 5 stars for effort and 4 stars for presentation.Highly recommended.	2001-02-22

Whether or not you like this book depends on whether or not you accept the basic premise that our modern society could collapse into a near dark ages chaos. If you do buy into the idea that our society and economy are fragile,and that frightening outcomes are possible,then this book is a &quot;must read&quot;. Although rather thinly veiled as a novel,this book contains much useful and factual information that could assist a &quot;survivor&quot;. This is not a go-out-and-kill-your-neighbor kind of book. Mr. Rawles is a sincere and religeous man and it shows in his thoughtful and generous view towards his fellow man in need (as described in the book). The characters are all pretty believable people--kinda like your next door neighbor kind people. What sets these characters apart as a group is a belief that our comfy world is about to go in the toilet. If one looks at nations and societies in a historical perspective,we look back on the wreckage of once-great civilizations and see that what we are living is perhaps a replay of Babylon or Rome or...<br />The only unreal aspects of the Todd Gray preparedness plans that I thought were laughable was the total absence of ANY livestock,chickens in the least,or a riding horse or two. But this is simply nit-picking on my part. Overall a thoroughly enjoyable book and never really dull. Not a bad book to have on your shelf &quot;just in case&quot;. Or maybe put it in a glass cased cabinet next to a hammer and a sign &quot;break glass in case of...(fill in the blank)&quot;. A solid 4 stars.	2001-02-22

This book is probably still Harry Turtledove's finest piece of &quot;alternate history&quot;; it is ,I believe,the standard by which other works in this genre must be compared.<br />The basic plot of this alternate history is that at the South's darkest hour help arrives from some mysterious strangers speaking with a strange accent. The help arrives in the form of the AK 47 Kalashnikov assault rifle! The introduction of this new wonder weapon to the troops of Lee's Army of Northern Virginia turns the tide of the war in favor of the South. I don't want to spoil the book for new readers by belaboring the plot line in a review, but there is a price to pay for the victory. The new weapons bring with them a new conflict unforseen at the inception of the novel,and in the course of the book the origins and thus the motives of the strangers are revealed. The story is carried not only by the principals ofthe time--Lincoln,Grant,Lee,Nathan Bedford Forrest--but by several fictional characters in the form of common soldiers, Nate Caudill and &quot;Melvin&quot; Bean are especially noteworthy. All in all a very satisfying little book;Turtledove's masterpiece. Not perfect but as good as it gets!	2001-02-20

This book doesn't occupy a space on my bookshelf--it is usually in someones hands having eyes and minds focussed on it...<br />John Ross takes the reader on a perilous journey through the &quot;gun culture&quot; in 20th Century America. Starting in the early 1900's with Ad Topperwein,the tale is at first historical. Many of the early day feats of arms are documented to lead the reader through many little-known events that begin to illustrate the true significance of the 2nd Amendment to the Constitution. Events such as the Bonus March and the 1939 U.S. vs. Miller case are used as examples of the author's basic premise that our government has become too intrusive and that a virtual police state has evolved. Mr. Ross introduces as his protaganist Henry Bowman,a young man from St. Louis,steeped in the gun culture from early childhood, and several other well developed characters that are essential to the plot. Most notable is Raymond Johnson from Colorado. Ray is very important to the tale since he experiences a long period of absence from the U.S. as a professional hunter in Africa. Upon his return he experiences massive culture shock and becomes Bowman's partner in the events detailed in the book. Many have expressed dissatisfaction with some of the sexual events described it exquisite detail,and to some of the language used. These events and some of the expletives are used deliberately in order to emphasize to the reader the dramatic changes our country has undergone in the last half of the past century. In the 1950's to describe such acts and use such language would have been almost unthinkable.  Cindy Caswell is used as a tool to describe some of the perversion our once moral society now ,if not condones , at least to which turns a blind eye. For out of the mouth of Cindy Caswell or of Raymond Johnson comes the outrage of the author towards a government that is out of control. The events of the novel may shock some,but the author may just be prophetic. <br />Nevera dull book in spite of it's length. Not for the weak of stomach or faint of heart. Buy it. Read it. Share it.	2001-02-20

As the opener for a new series,Worldwar:In the Balance, really reaches out and grabs you and doesn't let go! The basic concept of an alien invasion taking place during a time when all the great powers of Earth are at war with on another is really innovative. The disruption to mankind in general as humans (Big Uglies,as the invaders call us) struggle to set aside petty grievances such as Pearl Harbor and Operation Barbarosa and band together to take on The Race (as the invaders refer to themselves)is,at times humorous,very entertaining.  The &quot;Lizards&quot; as all humans generally refer to the invaders, are not just surprised by the warm reception they are receiving, but are genuinely exasperated that the recon probe that was sent 800 years earlier and showed only savages with spears and knights on horseback was not that which awaited them. Instead humanity fought back with Panzers vs. Landcruisers, propeller driven aircraft vs. jet powered killercraft, and a ruthlessness and skill level that the race could not match through computer simulations. In this volume,the lizards are held at bay by the not-Empire of the Deutsche and the panzer forces in Russia. One of the more interesting episodes involves the use Eisenbahnkanon &quot;Dora&quot; to inflict grevious losses on the lizards. The book is very nicely paced considering the number of characters introduced--both human AND lizard. We are introduced to the major players in this volume of Worldwar , many of whom are still going strong (or not so strong) in the later volumes and continuing into the Colonization series. We are treated to cameo appearances by a number of world leaders of the era--Josef Stalin, Enrico Fermi, Leslie Groves,to name a few. In summary, an entertaining book. My only complaint is some of the dialogue coming out of the characters' mouths is a bit too contrived,and somewhat repetitive. A strong 4-stars ; I would really like to give it 4 1/2 stars; just not quite a &quot;5&quot;.	2001-02-18

I usually look forward to Harry Turtledove's &quot;next book&quot; in several of the series that he has running. I particularly like to keep up with various characters that he has developed rather nicely,such as Jake Featherston and Cinncinnatus. At times this book moves along rather well and some of the writing is paticularly inspired,but for the greater part of the book we are simply plodding along from one telegraphed situation to another. Not very satisfying;therefore--2 stars.  I thought that the situation in which the CSA found itself in regards to armaments to be a bit odd,considering that their major ally, Great Britain, was one of the World's leading industrial powers...and a naval power! My conclusion regarding this particular &quot;installment&quot; in the neverending saga ,is that it is really a setup for a real doozer of a &quot;Second World War&quot;. The parallel of the CSA being disarmed and occupied,as was Germany at the end of &quot;real-time&quot; W.W.I,is a good teaser for history buffs.Of course the anger, resentment, and the loser's desire for revenge sets up the next war. I suspect that the next book in the series will really make this one an important cornerstone for future developments. The generally flat tone of this book was not very satisfying,but it did leave me wanting more. Overall,this book was a necessary evil in order to further bring Dr. Turtledove's alternate history timeline to completion. I look forward to the next volume with enthusiasm.	2001-02-17

Griffin than the two works that followed. As usual,there is a compelling plot line in mounting a mission to the Gobi desert in order to establish a weather station for forthcoming B-29 raids against the Japanese home islands. As usual &quot;Killer&quot; McCoy and Ernie Zimmerman are involved as &quot;the doers&quot;. As usual,Fleming Pickering is the behind-the-scenes manipulator and planner. As usual, Franklin Roosevelt is Machivellian. As usual, Bill Donovan almost manages to screw up the works. As usual, McCoy manages to pull off the mission.<br />All that said, I really did like the book. Aside from too much time being spent by Fleming Pickering doing his little political intrigues to offset Bill Donovan's little political intrigues, the book was a fairly satisfying read and manages to hold the reader's interest very well. I found that several of the characters introduced early in the series (Milla Banning) to have their roles resolved , and others moved on to new levels of future importance (Easterbunny). I thought the mission to the Gobi desert was quite unusual and the cameo of &quot;vinegar Joe' Stilwell was a nice touch. <br />My major compliaint about this series is that it is moving too slowly,and at one book every 2-3 years it will take about 20 years to complete. C'mon WEB! Speed things up before your readers all croak!<br />I would like to see McCoy marry Ernie Sage,see Flem Pickering run out of Famous Grouse, and move on to Korea. As things stand,there is little left for McCoy to do as an intel officer in W.W.II. I enjoy a faster paced story line and this one seems to be starting to drag a bit. A little less time spent on &quot;filler&quot; of various sexual/bedroom antics of various young officers and more time spent on the actual mission in the Gobi with Zimmerman and McCoy  would have upgraded the rating to 5-stars.	2001-02-15

The story line involving an American Marine of Argentine descent and his involvement with the O.S.S. and struggles to keep Argentina out of W.W.II as a German co-belligerent is awfully thin and contrived. The character development usually present in most Griffin books is sadly lacking here.The characters are,at best,forgettable and terribly shallow. This is probably the worst effort yet by my favorite author;it is the only one of his books that I didn't feel the urge to re-read. Two stars is generous. If you started this series and feel the need to wrap it up--O.K. read the book. Not a good intro to W.E.B. Griffin for a new reader...	2001-02-15

Although this book is now several years old I felt it was worth the time to comment on it since WEB just had another installment of The Brotherhood of War published. The new book had it's usual effect on me and I went into a &quot;Griffin feeding frenzy&quot; and re-read the last two books in The Corps&quot; series.<br />I rated this book &quot;5-Stars&quot; solely on the basis of the main plot--the support of guerrilla warfare activities in the Phillippines and the story of Wendell Fertig. I happen to like Ken McCoy and Ernie Zimmerman as central characters in all of The Corps novels. It is too bad that Griffin has elevated Fleming Pickering to such prominence in the more recent episodes;I prefer a more action-dominated story line and some of the &quot;fluff&quot; involving the O.S.S. involvement leaves me cold.  My biggest criticism of the book is the relatively slow pace of the action. Too much time spent on wrangles with Bill Donovan and the O.S.S. hierarchy and Fleming Pickering swilling scotch. Some of these other criticisms might make the book less compelling for other readers,but I decided to overlook a few warts in my rating. I am tired of only one book in The Corps  every 2-3 years. It is by FAR the best series the author has going. I can't abide the Cop series and I am thoroughly tired of Argentina. Stick to the Marines--forget the rest.	2001-02-13

I generally look forward to the continuing novels in this series by Harry Turtledove. The ongoing conflict between &quot;the race&quot; (lizards) and mankind is an interesting &quot;gedanken&quot; experiment. The setting of this particular episode is the mid 1960's and mankind has both created new technology ad also &quot;borrowed&quot; from the lizards creating an uneasy balance of power on Tosev 3. Most,if not all,of the old familiar faces are present in their usual roles. That in my view is the major problem with this book. I am getting a bit tired of Rance Auerbach and Penny Summers being tossed into the lizard clink for ginger smuggling. What leads me to believe that we have yet one more episode in this series is the lack of a real closure to the story or a real conclusion. We are left scratching our collective heads about Hans Drucker and the Reich. We wonder if Monique Doutard was really serious for her reasons stated to Ttomalis for getting Rance Auerbach out of lizard jail. Dr. Turtledove needs to spend a little more time on this series and get a real rousing wrap-up. He needs to speed up the pace of action and concentrate more on the main theme of lizard-human conflict instead of Kassequit and her eternal self-introspection and whining. I would expect a return to open warfare and alot more from Lewis and Clark/Glen Johnson. Overall, a good concept for a series, but a real letdown in some of the execution. Could have been a 5-star if better paced with some real action leading to a conclusion. It would help if some of the less essential characters were &quot;retired&quot;.I strongly suspect that volume 4 in this series is in the works;if not,it needs to be.	2001-02-09

I originally purchased this book several years ago,and every time I sat down to read it I seemed to lose interest after a few chapters. I finally forced myself to finish the thing--not an easy task. The protaganists of the Draka are not an admirable group unless you considered Jack the Ripper admirable. The basic plot to this novel(an alternative history?)deals with the Draka invasion of Soviet Georgia in the foothills of the Caucasus mountains and the conflict with the German Reich,which has also invaded the same geographic area. The Draka are portrayed as strong,crafty,and unbeatable. The Germans are portrayed as drunken womanizers and somewhat inept at warfare , good only at beating their heads against a stone wall. Several times I threw this book in the firestarter burn basket,only to later retreive it in the hopes that I would find something of merit contained therin.

I had very high hopes for the Colonization series,but the story line seems to be dragging!

Unfortunatly the action present in the Worldwar series is sadly lacking here...I am getting a little bored with Moishe Russie and the role of the Zionists,since their impact on the story line seems to me as rather thin. The treatment of the Deutsche as being terminally stupid and militaraly lacking in ability to see strategic outcomes is bizzare. The introduction of Dr. Walter Dornberger is about all that keeps me turning pages (in the hope that we'll get a little more action). The Lewis and Clark space probe is good,and I hope that we can start seeing this series conclude with a bit more excitement. Turtledove is a very gifted writer and I believe that he is capable of trimming out a few of the less intersting characters to keep up a better paced story in the future. I really liked Rance Auerbach as a cavalry officer in the Worldwar series but as a broken down ginger peddler he loses a lot of credibility. Overall--too much emphasis on character development and not enough action taken to resolve the story into a final outcome. Just barely a 3 star. Could have been MUCH better.	2001-01-27

Griffin reader,I was pleasantly surprised that he resurrected the &quot;Brotherhood of War&quot; series. Perhaps Griffin's strongest suit is character development,and in this novel he has demonstrated that ability with particular flair.      This novel deals with a time period during the so-called &quot;cold war&quot; when Castro's Cuba was just beginning to be perceived as a major threat not only to the Caribbean,but to the entire western hemisphere. It involves most of the characters previously introduced by Griffin in his previous &quot;Brotherhood&quot; series,most notably Craig Lowell and Sanford T.&quot;Sandy&quot; Felter.       After an action filled Chapter One in which the former Belgian Congo is introduced as the scene of action,the story line pursues the planning,and execution of the plans,developed to effectively neutralize Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara's efforts to &quot;liberate&quot; the Congo. Several new and interesting personae are introduced,including &quot;jack&quot; Portet and a more highly developed George Washington &quot;Father&quot; Lunsford. We also get a brief &quot;Griffin&quot; glimpse of LBJ.      After the Special Forces operation in the Congo concludes,the story line and it's execution become a little nebulous due to many pages worth of extracts of CIA communications,which in turn,lead to a somewhat weak conclusion to the novel. Had the ending been as strong as the rest of the book,it would have rated 5 stars instead of the 4 stars I gave it.	2001-01-25
