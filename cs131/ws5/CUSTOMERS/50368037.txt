Only a careful autopsy can tell, and even then, there remains a question of whether the victim's death was a murder or was due to an accidental overdose of medication.  It remains for Lieutenant Nathan Shapiro and his sidekick, Tony Cook to come up with a conclusion. <br /> <br />The facts are these: <br /> <br />After a party at his home, Broadway actor Clive Branson is found dead in his bedroom by his butler.  At first it looks like a death from natural causes, but an autopsy reveals that he had taken or been given a large dose of a medication to which he had a serious sensitivity.  If it was murder, it had to have been committed by someone who was aware of this sensitivity. <br /> <br />As background, Clive, a veteran movie actor, was starring in a new Broadway production, playing a part that he really was too old for.  The play had gotten financial backing based on his drawing power, but it had become all too apparent to all concerned that he was too old, and his acting style too stiff for the part.  The critics were all in accord about this. <br /> <br />The list of suspects with both motive to kill him and opportunity to administer the lethal dose was long. <br /> <br />First, there was his understudy, who got his big break, and a big salary increase, as a result of Clive's death.  Next, there was his valet, who inherited a sizeable portion of Clive's estate.  Also, there were a couple of ex-wives, one of whom was in a minor role in the play, who each were left $50,000 in his will -- a goodly amount in the time frame in which this book is set.  Even more -- the author of the play, as well as the producer and director all had  motives to get rid of him (i.e. his understudy was better suited to the part) but were also at risk as a result of his death (i.e. the play was sold out for months based on Clive's drawing power and they didn't know if audiences would come to see Clive's understudy inthe starring role). <br /> <br />In order to find the killer, if, indeed, there really was one, Shapiro and Cook needed to use their intuitions and their analytical skills along with a lot of good old fashioned foot work.  To add to their difficulties, as they got closer to a solution, one of their chief suspects was murdered, narrowing the suspect field by one but virtually assuring them that Clive's death really had been murder. <br /> <br />That's the set up.  I'm afraid that the only way you'll find out the conclusion is to read the book yourself.  There is enough suspense here to keep any mystery fan turning pages.	2005-03-21

A group of dedicated policemen (and women) have multiple murders to solve.  At first there seem to be no clues and no motives for the killings.  There are no witnesses to anything, at least no witnesses who are willing to talk to the police.  Anyone who might know anything seems to be frightened almost \\"out of his or her wits.\\"  As is often the case in Police Fiction, the higher-ups who are politically motivated but who have no actual experience in investigative work, are putting pressure on our hard working heroes to solve the murders yesterday for publicity purposes.   <br /> <br />This, then, is the background for this latest Bill Slider mystery.  Into the plot mentioned above are thrown the first murder victim, who is discovered, stabbed, sitting upright on a children's swing in a park, without any identification; a couple of later murder victims; Detective Inspector Slider, and his domestic problems; Detective Atherton, and his domestic problems; Slider's boss whose wife has just died; and an assortment of witnesseses, victims, and good and bad guys, who sometimes are not so good or not so bad; and, oh yes, an oddball witness or two such as a blind man and his retarded adult son. <br /> <br />What I think that Cynthia Harrod-Eagles (the author) does so well is to show how a group of police investigators, working as a team, and following up each lead, no matter how minor, doing repetitive, fatiguing legwork, can make a case out of seeming bits and pieces of nothing.  She also makes almost all of her main characters come to life, and gives them lives and problems of their own, outside of the main plot. <br /> <br />I was also fascinated by the sense of humor she showed in her chapter titles, each one a masterful pun.  Following are a few of my favorites: <br /> <br />\\"Opening the Male\\" <br /> <br />\\"The Eyes Have It\\" <br /> <br />\\"From Err to Paternity\\" <br /> <br />\\"Bra-Tangled Spanner\\" <br /> <br />And, my personal absolute favorite: \\"Bet Your Bottom Deux Lards\\" <br /> <br />To find out how well each of these and ten or so more chapter titles fit into the content of their respective chapters, I guess that you'll just have to read __ GONE TOMORROW __ yourself.	2004-12-08

The respondents have stayed at hotels an average of 36 nights per year.  This adds up to roughly 600,000 nights annually.  These survey participants rated these hotels, resorts and spas on the quality of their rooms, services, dining facilities, and on their public spaces/facilities.  In addition the resources of the American Society of Travel Agents and their 900 members were used.  Overall then, the ratings represent a pretty broad range of experiences that should be a good indication of what to expect at each location.    In addition to rating the various properties by their location, this survey breaks them down by top scorers in a number of categories such as Top Hotel Chains, Top 50 hotels, Top 50 resorts, Top 50 small hotels, Tops by region and Top service and Dining to name just a few.    After the main portion of the survey, there is a sspecial features index, listing such items as Bed and Breakfast properties, Convention Centers, right down to Private Balconies, Water Views, and \\"Trendy Places.\\"  The list is too long to include here, but might just have the information you need to make one place more appealing to you and your family than another one you might be considering.       There are other useful sections, such as some very handy travel tips including methods of getting your reservations at better prices than those published.    Overall, for the upscale traveler, I think that this Zagat Survey is one that ought to be consulted while planning a trip.	2004-12-05

Agatson) in conjunction with a Nutritionist as a diet to recommend to his patients who needed a diet to help alleviate their heart problems.  It proved successful for many of its target audience.  It's a low carbohydrate diet that differentiates between \\"good\\" carbs and \\"bad\\" ones.  Simplistically speaking,  good ones are found in vegetables, some grains, etc., while those that we can categorize as \\"bad\\" are most often found in flour based products (bread, cereals, cakes, etc.) and in starchy foods such as potatoes and rice. <br /> <br />The diet itself is broken into three phases which I like to compare to the gears in a car:   <br /> <br />Phase one, the two week phase, is comparable to first gear.  It gets you off to a start from a stndstill, and lasts for about two weeks.  It is the most restrictive phase, and the average dieter loses around ten to twelve pounds during this start-up phase.   <br /> <br />Phase two, like second gear in a car, is used to get you up to full speed in automobile terms, or down to your desired weight in diet terms.  It is less restrictive than the first phase, and lasts, as I mentioned, until you are up to speed, or in dieting terms, down to goal weight.   <br /> <br />Phase three is sort of like cruise control.  You use cruise control to maintain a steady speed on the open road, and you use the even less restrictive diet in this phase to maintain your weight loss. <br /> <br />Yes, as mentioned in other reviews there are daily meal plans for each phase, and some of the foods are expensive and some of the recipes are complicated.  I personally looked at these meal plans as guidelines to be followed, not as absolute requirements.  I stay away from all the forbidden foods, eat a few more of the foods I really like, particularly salads, and avoid those too complex menus, etc, and it works out very well. <br /> <br />A little personal background, I am diabetic,have hypertension, and was considerably overweight.  I am also not young and not particularly prone to exercise other than taking daily (or almost daily) brisk walks a half an hour or so in duration. <br /> <br />Last May (2004) some routine blood work indicated that my cholesterol was out of whack, and my physician said I really needed to lose weight.  He thought weight loss might handle the cholesterol problems without my taking additional medication.  After some discussion, we, together, decided that the South Beach diet was probably the best approach for me. <br /> <br />I got the book, read it, and started on the diet.  In the first two weeks I lost the ten pounds that are expected.  Over the next four months I lost an additional forty pounds for a total of fifty.  I have maintained this weight loss easily by avoiding those foods that are \\"no-nos,\\" and I never go hungry or feeling unsatisfied. <br /> <br />Additional benefits are that controlling my diabetes now requires less medication, and my blood pressure has dropped considerably.  This is the only diet plan I have ever tried with which I am comfortable enough to believe that I will never return to my old eating habits. <br /> <br />Are there any disadvantages?  Yes.  I've had to buy a whole new wardrobe due to my six inch smaller waistline and proportionately smaller chest size, etc., and have had to have my wedding ring resized.  Other than that no complaints. <br /> <br />Based on my own experience, I wholeheartedly recommend __THE SOUTH BEACH DIET__. <br />  <br />	2004-11-29
US	50368037	R3V5CJ8K0I3TGV	1568655991	531002124	Booth	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A HISTORICAL FICTION NARRATED BY JOHN SURRATT	Just for information: the edition of this book that I am reviewing is not the large print 1988 edition listed by Amazon.  It is a standard sized print edition published in 1998 by Doubleday's Anchor Books division. <br /> <br />The narrator is John Surratt, a real participant in the conspiracy to assassinate Abraham Lincoln, a conspiracy which was led by John Wilkes Booth.  As the author states in his \\"Sources and Acknowledgements\\" at the end of the book, his novel is essentially correct in all pertinent details, but has been \\"fictionalized\\" in ways that enhance the telling of the story. <br /> <br />The narrative is made up of interconnected excerpts earlier diary written from 1864 to 1865, and the diary of John Wilkes Booth written during the days between his murder of Abraham Lincoln and his (Surratt's) about two weeks later; excerpts from testimony in the trials of Mary Surratt (John's mother), shortly after the assasination, and that of John Surratt about two years later, after his capture in Italy and deportation to America. <br /> <br />__BOOTH__ opens with Surratt's first diary entry in 1916 written shortly after he has been contacted by famed early film pioneer D.W. Griffith who wants Surratt to collaborate with him in the making of a movie about the assassination of Lincoln.  Surratt's collaboration would be extremely valuable because he has in his possession his own diaries from the asassination period and a number of photographs that could greatly enhance the movie. <br /> <br />This request from Griffith causes Surratt to reread his old diaries and look at his old photos for the first time in about 50 years.  These diaries form the core of __BOOTH__. <br /> <br />If we are to believe Surratt's diary entries, he was a rather unwilling participant in the conspiracy, and until the very end, he believed that Booth intended to kidnap Lincoln, not to murder him.  He also tells us that his mother, Mary Surratt, was not a part of the plot, and was only arrestedbecause of \\"guilt by association.\\" <br /> <br />John Wilkes Booth is presented as a very intelligent man who is extremely charismatic, and as one who seems to effortlessly charm everyone he meets, including both Surratt, his mother, and his sister. <br /> <br />The basic history of the events surrounding Booth's assassination of Lincoln in Ford's theatre in Washington, D.C. are well known. <br /> <br />Booth shot Lincoln in Lincoln's box in the theater, jumped to the stage, broke his leg in the jump but still managed to escape.  He evaded capture for about two weeks, but was finally found hiding in a barn and shot and killed by a Union soldier. <br /> <br />Boooth's three major co-conspirators, Lewis Powell, David Herold, and George Atzerodt were quickly captured along with Mary Surratt.  Evidently, had Lewis Powell not been captured in Mary Surratt's boarding house Mary would never have been arrested, but arrested she was.  She, along with the three true members of the conspiracy, was found guilty and hanged.  The evidence against her, as given by one of her boarders, was that she had often been seen in the company of Booth, and that another of the conspirators, George Atzerodt had done gardening work for her.  Questionable evidence of participation in a conspiracy, at best, but found guilty nonetheless. <br /> <br />John Surratt escaped to Europe, where he lived for two years before being returned to the U.S. and tried.  He was not found guilty and was released and lived for another 50 years. <br /> <br />One of the major fictional devices that Robertson (the author used) was to make Surratt a photographer in the employ of Alexander Gardner, a famous Civil War photographer.  Robertson says that he did this to more easily work in the photographs he has included in the book.  Amongst other photos are several of Booth, one famous battlefield photo of a dead Confederate soldier, three gallows shots of the four prisoners, both before and after the hanging, and a photoof Sergeant Boston Corbett, the man who shot Booth.  Also, there is no historical indication that the contact in 1916 between Surratt and Griffith ever happened, but it is a useful device to set up the whole novel <br /> <br />As is so often the case, there is no way in a short review to convey the emotional and dramatic impact that a good author can bring into play.  I believe that David Robertson's novel does have these kinds of impacts on the readers of _BOOTH__, making the reading of this novel a positive reading experience along with being a learning experience.	2004-11-26
US	50368037	R25IZDEHKWFMWV	0517599082	469814827	Goodbye, Saigon: A Novel	Books	4	2	2	N	N	CROSS CULTURAL FEMINIST HUSTLERS IN LITTLE SAIGON	I think that a little background is in order before I begin the body of this review.  Nina Vida, the author of __LITTLE SAIGON__, was gradually accepted into this close knit, generally closed to outsiders, American Vietnamese community, after her husband had taken over a law practice in the \\"Little Saigon\\" area of Los Angeles.  The men and women of this community shared many of their personal stories with her and it was the essence of these stories that gave her enough background to write this book. <br /> <br />The basic plot can be summed up in a few sentences:   <br /> <br />Truong Anh survives and supports her unappreciative family, including parents, siblings, and nieces and nephews, by hustling in a local poker parlor.  Her main source of income in the period leading up to the start of the novel is an American lawyer named Dennis, whom Anh helps at the Pai Gow table and in return earns very big tips.   <br /> <br />Jana, an American born Anglo, is Dennis's secretary/paralegal, and supports herself and her son from her earnings at the one man la firm. <br /> <br />Dennis has two bad habits, he is a compulsive gambler, and is addicted to expensive, illegal drugs.  His gambling addiction causes him to fritter away the better part of a million dollar settlement he received, and his adiction brings on a nearly fatal heart attack.  These two things, in combination, cause both Anh and Jana to lose their source of income.   <br /> <br />After about a month long search, Anh finds Jana, and after some misgivings, they team up to illegally keep Dennis's law firm going with Jana acting as an attorney, and Anh bringing in many, many Vietnamese clients.   <br /> <br />Their firm is so popular that they come to the attention of a local gang who try to cut themselves into part of the profits, when this fails, they take revenge on Anh and Jana in a myriad of ways including the murder of one of Anh's brothers, and the destruction of their office and all their files. <br /> <br/>Jana and Anh are left to find redemption and revenge in whatever ways they can. <br /> <br />Along the way, we are let into Anh's home, leading to some exposure to the home life and the all important superstitions of this immigrant society.  In alternating sections, we see how Anh, at the age of 13 was sold by her father, into prostitution in Vietnam, and how she became stronger, not weaker as a result of this experience.  Often she has saved her family from death and total ruin both in Vietnam and America, only to be told by her superstitious parents that she in an unlucky child and a \\"bad\\" daughter.  She always responds to this rejection with a shrug, and continues to take cre of them. <br /> <br />This is a novel which does have it's weaknesses, as described in the editorial reviews, but which is strong in showing the ins and outs of family relations, dynamics in a closed community, and the emotional toughness, and sense of humor needed to cope with a very harsh world. <br /> <br />So, in spite of a few weaknesses, I think that __GOODBYE SAIGON__ is a book well worth reading for plot, at least one compelling protagonist (Anh), and vivid pictures of a culture.	2004-11-19
US	50368037	R1S19S1UTKAQWV	0425036065	367277158	An Expensive Place to Die	Books	3	4	6	N	N	EARLY LEN DEIGHTON NOVEL -- NOT UP TO HIS LATER WORK	On the whole, I am a fan of most of Len Deighton's later works particularly all nine of the Bernard Samson Novels.  I think that reading one of an author's early novels after having read, and enjoyed, much of his later work, leaves you ripe for a little disappointment.  That was my reaction here.  He just hadn't completely found his \\"voice\\" in this novel which was originally published in 1966, well before those nine Bernard Samson novels I mentioned earlier (Copyright dates 1984 through 1996). <br /> <br />I found the plot unnecessarily complex.  It starts with an anonymous spy, residing in Paris, who receives a bundle of documents from a courier with the instructions to deliver them to a man he knows as Datt.  But he is not do just deliver them at a convenient time or place.  This would be too easy.  He is to keep them until Datt gets them from him in his (Datt's) own time and by whatever method Datt decides on.  Datt's method involves kidnapping him, injecting him with \\"truth serum.\\" and having the documents stolen from his room while he is so detained.  An interesting delivery, indeed! <br /> <br />This is the beginning of the the United States deliberate revelation of certain Nuclear Weaponry information, or perhaps well disguised misinformation, to representatives of the Chinese Communist government. <br /> <br />During the course of __AN EXPENSIVE PLACE TO DIE__, there are kidnappings, murders, scenes in a high end brothel that caters to diplomats, where dossiers on these diplomats are developed, and where films are made of them in compromising positions.  There are surprises, double-crosses, and unexpected revelations around every corner before we finallly sort out the good(?) guys from the bad (also ?) guys. <br /> <br />If you like Len Deighton's later novels, this is a good book to read from the standpoint of seeing how much he developed as a spy novelist through the years, and it certainly contains the seeds of many of the themes he developed in his laternovels. <br /> <br />In the words of a current movie critic, \\"I give it a moderate thumbs up.\\"	2004-11-19
US	50368037	R27JAY5UDHJPK8	0375422765	253560182	War Trash	Books	5	2	2	N	N	MOVINGLY WRITTEN FACT BASED WORK OF FICTION	In his author's notes, Ha Jin states that although this is a work of fiction and that all of his main characters are fictional, \\"most of the events and details are ... factual.\\" <br /> <br />The novel's focus is the Korean War experiences of a Chinese soldier named Yu Yuan who was forced by the Communist regime to become part of the \\"volunteer\\" Chinese Army sent to fight in Korea and eventually to raid South Korea. <br /> <br />This \\"volunteer\\" army is poorly trained, inadequately armed and equipped, and so poorly fed that many men die of starvation.  In addition they are instructed that they must fight to the death, because to be captured will be considered an act of treason.  They are told that the \\"Yankees\\" are \\"Paper Tigers\\" and will turn and run at the sight of the heroic Chinese troops. <br /> <br />Ha Jin's descriptions of Yuan's experience in a series of battles directed from afar by leaders who have no concept of fighting a war have to be read in order to understand the sheer horror of the living conditions.  Tens of thousands of Chinese troops die because of conflicting orders that put them in untenable positions where they are fodder for the enemy's superior firepower.  The troops who bear the brunt of the horror of this situation, soon learn that their enemy soldiers are not the paper tigers they were led to expect, and that, in addition to well armed, well trained ground forces, the enemy has overwhelming air power and artillery support. <br /> <br />Yuan is severely injured in battle, captured, and sent to an American Hospital, where his shattered leg is saved in a series of surgical procedures performed by a caring American surgeon. <br /> <br />This hospital experience is, however, the last nurturing experience he will receive while in captivity. <br /> <br />He is sent to a prison camp where there is a power struggle going on between the Nationalists, who are loyal to Chiang and want to go to Taiwan rather than be repatriated to China, and the Communists, who wish to go back to China.  In many ways Yuan is caught in the middle.  He wants to reurn to China because he has a fiancee and an aging mother there, but he is not a Communist.   <br /> <br />The Nationalists are in the majority in his first compound, and treat those who wish to return to mainland China with ferocious brutality.  The Americans generally turn their backs on what is going on within the barbed wire compound, and by their intential neglect allow murder, mutilation and mayhem to be the everyday experience. <br /> <br />Yuan is caught in the middle of this because his command of the English language makes him valuable to both sides.  One method used by the Nationalists to coerce him and several others is to forcibly tattoo them with anti-Communist slogans which would make them suspect if they were ever repatriated.  (As an aside, neither side really considers him as an individuual, but rather as an asset to be used at will.) <br /> <br />Eventually, he ends up in an all Communist compound where his life is a little better.  Living conditions are still terrible, and their captors often resort to humiliation and torture as forms of contral. <br /> <br />Eventually, after the completion of the Peace Talks, he gets back to China, but only after several more humiliating prisoner of war camp experiences, only to find out that he, along with all of the others who chose repatriation are considered traitors for allowing themselves to be captured.  He is put through months of official \\"questioning,\\" is stripped of all his medals, and is considered an undesireable.  For good measure, his mother, who was one of the main reasons he wanted to return, had died while he was a prisoner, and his fiancee, who was the other reason, will have nothing more to do with this \\"undesireable traitor.\\" <br /> <br />The upside is that he does get a teaching position, eventually marries, has children and grandchildren, and much later is able to emigrate to the U.S. <br /> <br />While I have given a general outline of the plot, this book must be read to get the feeling of the horrors of his wartime experiences from battle to prison to his return home.  Ha Jin has taken true incidents and details and written a truly moving condemnation of war and how so many unwilling people become the victims of what happens in a wartime atmosphere.  Based on my own reaction to both the facts and the emotions Ha Jin's writing brough out, I can't recommend this book highly enough.	2004-11-16

(Novelist and Business Administrator to name two)  In this novel, as in most of his others, he uses his background in all three to concoct a murder mystery which involves some newly found bones which are the remnants of members of a scientific mission who were killed in an avalanche 30 years ago. <br /> <br />Elkins's protagonist, Gideon Oliver, is \\"Johnny-on-the-spot\\" when some of those bones resurface as the result of the shifting of the glacier in which they were embedded. <br /> <br />Also present is the leader of that ill-fated mission, now a famous T.V. personality, and one of Television's grand poseurs.  His main purpose in returning to the scene is to prepare the way for the publication of his forthcoming novel about the expedition and the deaths resulting from the avalanche.  This preparation includes getting releases from all interested parties, so the remaining members of that ill-fated expedition, and the closest relatives of the deceased are along for the ride.  <br /> <br />After the resurfacing of the bones, Gideon is able to determine that they belong to only two of the three victims, and that one of the two had been killed, not by the avalanche, but by being hit in the skull by an ice axe.  <br /> <br />From here on, the plot speeds up a bit when \\"Mr. T.V. personality\\" is found murdered and his manuscript is missing.  (The plot is a little slow during explanatons of the use of the bones for analytical purposes re: sex, size, identification of individuals, etc.)  <br /> <br />The questions I'll leave you with, and which I hope will entice you to read __ICY CLUTCHES__, are: <br /> <br />Are the bones that were found those of the two men in the expedition, or of one of the men and the one woman? <br /> <br />Why was the manuscript stolen? <br /> <br />Why the present day murder? <br /> <br />Are the new murder and the 30 year old one related? <br /> <br />Who was the murderer 30 years ago, and who is the modern day murder, and are they one and the same person? <br /> <br />These are the questions that can only be answered by reading this novel.

She is the only person who tries to help him while several people at a nearby fast food joint just watch while she tries to protect him with her own body.  Sad to say, she only temporarily brings the beating to a halt before one man stabs the victim 11 times and kills him. <br /> <br />In another, Martinez tells of a local bank which has a dress code requiring women to wear panties but has no uch rule that requires men to wear undershorts. <br /> <br />He tells of the uproar among teens at one of the wealthier local high schools when a City Councilwoman suggests that alternatives to proms which cost over a thousand dollars (including the prom itself, limo's tuxes, etc.) which might make it possible for the less affluent students to attend too. <br /> <br />In another teen oriented column, he talks about how some teens feel that they are being denied their constitutional rights when their high schools attempt to remove unhealthy foods from the campuses. <br /> <br />In another column he tells of the patients in a Hospitalh emergency room waiting room diagnosing one another's ailments with all the authority of trained physicians.  For example, the man who diagnosed another's stomach ailment as the result of eating peanuts even though the man with the stomach problem hadn't been eating peanuts. <br /> <br />He talks of his personal sense of loss when his pre-school grand-daughter and her parents move out of his home into their own.  He had dreaded the thought of a child in diapers living in his home, then felt even worse when, after a couple of years she left. <br /> <br />These are only a few examples of the dozens of columns included in _DANCING UNDER THE MOON__.  It's one of those books that you can pick up at any time, read for a few minutes, put down, pick up again later, and not worry that you've lost your train of thought.	2004-11-13

California Restaurants (Zagatsurvey: Los Angeles/Southern California Restaurants)	Books	4	11	12	N	N	RESTAURANT REVIEWS BY "REAL PEOPLE"	The beauty of this, as in all Zagat Surveys, is that the main input for each restaurant comes from real diners who have eaten at the restaurant being reviewed.  There seem to be enough reviews, judging from individual comments included, to average out the comments from someone who was there on a &#34;bad night&#34; with those who were there on &#34;average nights&#34; and &#34;great nights.&#34; <br /> <br />If you are looking for the kind of reviews that food critics give, discussing the merits (and demerits)of various sauces, specialties, etc., this is not the book for you.  If however, you want to know how a large number of people, who have eaten there, feel about the restaurant, this IS a good restaurant guide. <br /> <br />The main section of the survey is alphabetical by restaurant.  There are cross references by location, by cuisine, and by special features.  There are also &#34;top 40&#34; lists for Food, Decor, and &#34;Bangs for the Buck.&#34; <br /> <br />If there is any problem with this survey, it is the fact that there are so many hundreds of small &#34;mom and pop&#34; restaurants in L&#62;A and the surrounding communities, particularly in cultural or ethnic enclaves, that they can't all be reviewed and included in this survey.  I am glad to report, however, that some of them are making it. <br /> <br />All in all, I'd say this is a valuable resource for consultation when you want to try somewhere different for a dinner or lunch out.	2004-11-12
US	50368037	RXBLQQBV1HC9Q	0681460660	476789197	Illustrated History of the American Farm Tractor	Books	5	0	0	N	N	FROM HORSES TO DIESEL ENGINES IN A HALF CENTURY	Author/Photographer Randy Leffingwell went on a personal odyssey throughout the country to obtain the approximately 450 photographs of mostly restored tractors that are included here.  (I say mostly restored because a few photographs are of either partially restored or yet to be restored models.)<br /><br />In many ways, the history of the tractor reflects the history of America at war and at peace.  For example, many early tractors utilized cleated tracks that shortly thereafter were used on military tanks.  In 1938, Minneapolis Moline's U-DLX tractor, with slight modification, became the first jeep; that all purpose military transport vehicle that we all know.  Early tractors used the same technology as train steam engines, and in many cases closely resembled those early engines.<br /><br />__ILLUSTRATED HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN TRACTOR__ traces the evolution of the tractor from horse drawn plows to a vehicle which replaced these teams of horses with a steam driven engine, and on to larger and more sophisticated steam tractors, then to their conversion to gasoline engines, and finally to diesel burning engines.<br /><br />The earliest tractors were log haulers modified to become tractors.  Some were huge for the time, weighing as much as five tons (Not so big now, but huge for the time).  Some required several people just to operate them.  Someone to keep the steam engine fed with fuel, and two or three more performing other operating tasks.<br /><br />All of the restorations seem to be beautifully done, are beautifully photographed, are fully operating, and are accompanied by text discussing their technical particulars and their place in history.  I am impressed by the amount of research that went into the book, and think that it is worth reading for the history revealed, for the photography, and for the anecdotal information such as the discussion in the introduction of the Russell Steam Tractor \\"spark show,\\" one early fall evening on a farm in Iowa.  (It's too bad that Leffingwell didn't have any photographs of this amazing sounding show.	2004-11-12

The stories and essays included in __WHILE ROME BURNS__ are dated from the late '20's to the early to mid '30's. For those of us who grew up a bit later in the century, they give some idea of what a great time we missed. <br />  <br /> In an article titled &quot;Our Miss Parker,&quot; he relates some of his personal experiences with another great wit of the time, Dorothy Parker. He tells of the time she substituted for Bennet Cerf in his position as a theater critic. Her review of the play, THE HOUSE BEAUTIFUL consisted of a single line, &quot;THE HOUSE BEAUTIFUL is the play lousy.&quot; Another time Woolcott went to visit Mrs Parker in the hospital, where she was ready to be released but was delaying leaving the hospital because she couldn't pay the bill. (Mrs Parker delayed doing most of her writing until she had to do so in order to pay her rent or, as in this case, had to come up with money immediately for something major.) She was propped up in her bed with her typewriter on her lap working on an article for one of the magazines which published her work. When Cerf came in she greeted him and almost immediately rang for the nurse. Suspecting that perhaps she needed some sort of service that required privacy, he offered to wait outside her room. Her response was, &quot;No, it is supposed to fetch the night nurse, so I ring it whenever I want an hour of uninterrupted privacy.&quot; One other example of her rather acidic wit was when a friend tried to sneak up behind her on a major New York shopping street and frighten her. She evidently saw his reflection in the glass window as he approached, so she turned and in her loudest voice began to shout at him that no, she wouldn't give him another cent and that he had already bled her dry. She kept this up until she drew a crowd, and he had to slink off with his eyes diverted to the ground. Most people learned very quickly that she was the master of &quot;the game.&quot; <br />  <br /> One of the articles is devoted to Charlie Chaplin, who Woolcot considered the finest silent actor of all time. Along with praising Chaplin, Woolcott makes no bones about his feeling that these new &quot;talkies&quot; are going to ruin moving pictures. (I guess no one can win them all.) <br />  <br /> There are articles of nostalgia for people, animals, and places long gone, and also for plays and books that have meant something to him. One play that he couldn't praise highly enough was &quot;Journey's End&quot; which takes place entirely in the trenches of World War One. From his description of the conversations and relationships of these mostly doomed foot soldiers, it sounds very much like a play that I would like to see revived. I have a feeling that this play, written around 1929 to 1930 contains some universal truths. <br />  <br /> On that note, I'd like to conclude with saying that this is the sort of book that, even though it had at least 18 prointings between 1934 and 1936, deserves another reprinting now for the kind of audience that enjoys knowing about life in the fairly recent past, and enjoys reading well written stories, memoirs, and articles about that life.	2004-07-27

For starters it is neatly categorized so that the reader can easily access trivia related to a particular (broad) category, instead of everything being scrambled together as is often the case. <br />  <br /> secondly, it is in a question and answer format with questions on one side of a page and their answers on the reverse side. Frequently, I have found myself bouncing back and forth from the front section of a book where the questions are found to the back section for their answers. Just turning the page for the answer is really helpful. <br />  <br /> Some of the answers do amaze you, while others make you laugh, or add to your store of useful knowledge. <br />  <br /> Some examples: <br />  <br /> Q. &quot;What is unusual about Mona Lisa's eyebrows in ...Davinci's Painting?  <br /> A. &quot;She has none.&quot; <br />  <br /> Q. &quot;What was the hometown of Sgt.

It proved to be useful for my purposes as well as of interest in general.<br />I found, for example, that Catholicism, along with many tribal and/or primitive religions (indigenous American peoples, native African cultures are two examples) had very specific rites of exorcism, which is defined in __A CATHOLIC DICTIONARY__ as &quot;the driving out of evil spirits in cases of demonical possession.&quot;  There is a detailed description of the rite of exorcism, including specific prayers and sections of the Bible to be read in the presence of the possessed, the order in which they should be read, and the training and qualifications of an exorcist.  <br />In other cultures, what we, for want of a more precise term, often call witch doctors, or more accurately shamans, perform their own prescribed rites to drive off, or to ward off, evil spirits.  While the details of the rituals are different, they too are prescribed and their intent is similar.<br />The 5,000+ entries cover a great amount of ground, ranging from categories with which most of us are familiar, to some very obscure, but often interesting ones.  An example of the latter follows.<br />KING'S EVIL:  The Kings of France and England have been granted the power to cure scrofula (the main symptom of which is a swelling of the neck glands), by touching the afflicted.  The last kings to perform this act of touching are said to be Henry IX of England and Charles X of France.  (For more details, see the subject dictionary.)<br />For me, this dictionary has proved useful both for finding very specific information and for randomly picking a page or two and learning something old that is new to me.	2004-07-05
US	50368037	R2IM0CG6IM09GG	0688167608	270025304	I, Che Guevara: A Novel	Books	4	1	1	N	N	CHE IS BACK AND VICTORIA'S  GOT HIM	For those of you too young to understand the not so subtle reference made in my title, here's the background for it.  Shortly after the end of World War II, probably in 1946 or 1947, Clark Gable returned to Hollywood from his stint in the military service.  His co-star in one of his firsr post-WWII movies was Greer Garson.  The headline in several of the ads for this movie was &quot;Gable's Back and Garson's Got Him.&quot;  In this novel, Che Guevara has returned from his assumed death 32 years earlier, and Victoria Savidge, almost has-been news anchor for a minor TV network is his (platonic) love interest.  Hence my title.<br />The plot outline follows along these lines:  Fidel Castro decides that it is time for him to retire, but wants to get something out of his retirement for the people of Cuba.  He believes that this can be accomplished is by taking some action that will get &quot;Tio Sam's&quot; sanctions removed along with their acceptance of certain other caveats to be set by him.  He, in turn is willing to make some promises of his own.  The caveats are that the U.S., in addition to removing the sanctions, exchange ambassadors, and provide computers for all Cuban students.  The promises are for truly free elections for the first time in Cuban history.  These elections will be open to monitoring by outsiders such as Jimmy Carter's minions.  <br />The U.S. accepts his offer, removes the sanctions, and gives Cuba official recognition by setting up an Embassy.<br />As might be expected, the old line power structure sets up a political party aimed at keeping the themselves in power.  The Miami exiles, paired with Casino interests who want to make Cuba into the kind of gambling haven it was before Castro, form a second party.  The stakes are big, and these two parties run campaigns that take the worst of U.S. campaigning, and run high powered negative campaigns.<br />As things are getting under way, an asthmatic old man starts entering small mountain villages and, over cups of coffee engages the villagers in conversations in which he tells them that, if they wanted to, they could become the backbone of a new kind of government.  This government could be a sort of bottom-up rather than top down government in which each small town would be essentially self governing and self supporting.  (The old Town Meeting type of government) There could be low interest loans with long payout periods so the farmers could own their own land, etc.  There also would need to be a small centralized government that needn't so much rule as to provide assistance where needed.  It seems that in his 32 years of exile, this charismatic old man had been reading works by Plato, and the U.S.'s own T. Jefferson, as he called him.<br />Over a few months, there is a groundswell of support for the old man's ideas.  Eventually people begin to realize that he is Che Guevara, and that he didn't die in Bolivia.  He never tells anyone he is Che, but goes by the name of Ernesto Blanco.  And he makes it plain that he wants no power or position of leadership for himself, but just wants to help the people help themselves.<br />Eventually this groundswell of support becomes so great that both of the major parties, fearing this movement more than they feared one another, hire assassins to stop him before it is too late.<br />Now for Victoria.  She starts out as a TV anchorwoman on a last chance assignment to Cuba.  Either she breaks a big story or her career is over.  When we first meet her, she is a shallow person with no convictions and no idealism, only thinking of herself and her career.  After several weeks in the mountains with Che and his small core group, she succumbs to the influence of Che's humble, pure personality and his idealism and exchanges her shallow self-centered perspective for a more honest one.  <br />To summarize the action of the book as described in more detail above:  Two political parties determined to win at any costs;  A movement backing apeople oriented concept introduced by Che;  A nearly has been reporter who evolves from shallow reporter to insightful idealist;  Two assassins determined to stop Che before he does too much damage;  And three other key members of Che's inner circle who help him out in dozens of small, but important, ways.  The suspense is provided by the uncertainty of the outcome of this most important election, and by the possibilities of success or failure of the assassination attempts.  <br />It doesn't say so in __I, CHE GUEVARA__, but in other places the pseudonomynous author has been identified as ex-Senator Gary Hart.  Hart has made the heart of his novel, not the action, but Che's ideas and idealism.  Every few pages, Hart interrupts the flow of the action with one of Che's interior monologues in which he reveals his ideas, and how and why he grew from the type of revolutionary he once was to someone espousing a revolution of ideas.  These passages, I believe, are the real reason Hart wrote the book.<br />While I question whether, in real life, there could be such a massive growth of support in such a short time for these new (old) ideas, or if they even could gain such support in the small peasant communities where Che gained his first few adherents, I admire the idealism and the concepts of Jeffersonian/Platonian Democracy he was espousing.<br />One other observarion before I quit.  This book was published in 1998, long before our current political season.  In it, a college professor in Montana (I think it is Montana) latches on to Che's ideas for a people-power government, and declares for the Senate.  Putting to work Che's principles of government by and for individuals, he sets up a web site in which he asks for supporters and donees for his campaign based on these principles.  He limits individual donations to $20.00 or less, and he gets several hundred thousand supporters who donate an average of almost $18.00 each.  Is it possible that this is where a recent internet based campaign got its idea for a political campaign along almost exactly these same lines?  It's certainly possible.	2004-07-03
US	50368037	R2UC4HTF9WD0V4	0312205406	963436946	Hot Six	Books	5	1	3	N	N	WORLD'S MOST INEPT (BUT LOVEABLE) BOUNTY HUNTER	After reading, in no particular order, a half dozen or so of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels, I decided that I had to review at least one of them (call it a compulsion to do so), and __HOT SIX__, being the most recent one I've read, got the nod.<br />I believe that the plots in these novels are mostly there to provide a background for the machinations of our intrepid bounty hunter and her friends and relatives.  The plot has been pretty well described in the 300+ previous reviews, so I'll just give it a very short discussion before getting into the part of this review that's the most fun for me.<br />In her position as a bounty hunter (officially bond enforcement agent), Stephanie is given the job of apprehending and bringing to court, the man who taught her everything she knows about the art of bounty hunting, the elusive man known as Ranger.  Ranger, who is out on bond, has missed a court appearance. He is the suspect of choice for a murder.  Stephanie, and everyone else, knows that bringing in Ranger is impossible -- no one captures Ranger.  No one!  But, it does seem that everyone wants to find him, the good guys, the bad guys, and a few intermediate semi-bad guys.  This situation provides background for the true meat of the novel, Stephanie's adventures and misadventures along the way.<br />To give you a an idea of just how good a bounty hunter Stephanie is, consider the following:  Most of the time Stephanie sets out on her apprehension tasks by leaving her gun at home in a cookie jar.  When she does take it, it usually has only one bullet, or even none, because she has forgotten to buy more.  When she does catch up with someone, her intended target more often than not gets away, and in so doing, wrecks her car, and/or sets her on fire, and/or handcuffs her with her own handcuffs, and/or just walks away while she is preoccupied with something else.  At any rate her success rate on the first few tries with each bail jumper is very, very low<br />She attempts clandestine surveillance in a nice inconspicuous &quot;Rollswagon,&quot; a car with the front of a Rolls Royce attached to the body of a Volkswagon.  Nobody'll spot this car!  It's a temporary replacement for her most recent wrecked car.<br />While trying to peer into the window of a suspect's house, our Stephanie falls out of a tree into his walled off back yard, and gets shot at.<br />There's lots more, but you get the idea.<br />Stephanie lusts after two men, the aforementioned Ranger, and her sometimes lover, sometimes protector, sometimes a few other things, Joe Morelli, police detective.  This lust is reciprocated by both men.<br />Stephanie has a grandmother who frequently totes a gun herself, thinks that she, too, would like to be a bounty hunter, and, spreading fear throughout the area, somehow passes the driving test and gets a drivers license.<br />Stephanie has a sidekick named Lula who is a retired prostitute and who frequently accompanies Stephanie on her misadventures.  Lula is a very large woman who dresses in skintight spandex apparel, carries two or three guns and, on every case, tells Stephanie what havoc she is going to wreak on each target.  Then when the time comes, tends to run away even faster than Stephanie.<br />Stephanie has a long suffering mother whose answer to any problem is to start ironing.<br />And, oh yes, did I mention that Stephanie's idea of home cooking is to make a peanut butter and potato chip sandwich.<br />There are also a few other colorful characters in Stephanie's life, both human and animal. These include her cousin Vinnie, the owner of the bonding agency, and her boss;  her &quot;arch enemy,&quot; Joyce Barnhardt; the inadvertantly comedic duo of Moonster and dougie, &quot;the dealer&quot; as well as her pet hamster, Rex; and Bob, the dog who eats everything he can reach, including furniture, and whom you'd like to hate, but can't because he's just too sweet.<br />When you toss all of these people and animals ina hopper, then add a few gangsters and lunatics to the mix, you end up with a laugh or two or even three on every page from the opening line right up to to the concluding sentence.  Thanks, Janet Evanovich, you keep me laughing.	2004-06-29

MACDONALD	Two years before putting together this 1984 anthology, MacDonald published what amounted to a first volume of some his early stories that had been published in various pulp fiction magazines.  This anthology, __MORE GOOD OLD STUFF__ is a second volume of those stories.  The 14 stories published here and the roughly equivalent number in the first book were culled out of several hundred stories he had written and seen published during the hey-day of the pulp fiction and detective magazines.  The publication dates of the stories included here range from 1946 to 1949.  I mention this because one of my pet peeves when reading anthologies is having to guess the era in which the story took place.  Here, MacDonald not only gives us the year of publication, but the name of the magazine in which it was published, and it's title at the time of publication.  (As is their wont, magazine publishers frequently don't use the author's title but give stories and articles titles that they, the publishers prefer.  Here, MacDonald uses his original titles, but, as mentioned above, gives us the publisher's title in the index.)<br />The pulps and detective fiction magazines provided a great place for a young &quot;wannabe&quot; writer to get a start.  Many of those authors, like MacDonald, went on to become well known authors, and they have the pulps to thank for their start.  <br />The stories here hint at MacDonald's potential as an author, but, read in today's somewhat more sophisticated world, often feel contrived and stilted.<br />A few of the stories that I found compelling were:<br />&quot;You Remember Jeanie,&quot; in which a drunk ex-policemen keeps coming back to the bar where his girlfriend, Jeanie, was murdered, accompanied, in his mind, by the murdered woman whom he always buys a drink.  In this one, MacDonald slips in a surprise ending that I, for one, didn't see coming.<br />&quot;I Accuse Myself,&quot;  in which a man who has suffered memory loss due to head trauma gradually recovers his memory, and as it comes back sees something that causes him to confess to a murder. His confession is much more revealing than he could ever imagine.<br />&quot;Deadly Damsel,&quot; in which a woman marries men with the intent of living with them until she gets bored and then making sure that they have some sort of fatal accident.  Always, of course, leaving her better off financially than she was before.  Her only mistake is falling in love, not a good thing for a would be serial murderess!<br />In a couple of the stories, there were so many plot quirks and twists that I couldn't quite keep up with who was whom and who was doing what to whom.  A few others were just so stilted that they didn't work for me.<br />Overall, I did enjoy this anthology, and I found it interesting to get an insight into the early stages of the developmen of an author whose later books, particularly the Travis McGee mysteries, I have enjoyed.	2004-06-27

I, like many of the other reviewers here, am a long standing fan of Tony Hillerman's mysteries featuring Joe &quot;The Legendary Lieutenant&quot; Leaphorn and Jim Chee.  I, also like many other reviewers, found __THE SINISTER PIG__ to be a compelling mystery.<br />It carries through many themes from earlier Hillerman mysteries:  We have Sgt. Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police, who is in love with Bernadette &quot;Bernie&quot; Manuelito, formerly of the Tribal Police, but now with the Border Patrol.  Chee is afraid to tell her of his feelings for fear of rejection.  We have the aforementioned Bernadette Manuuelito who is in love with Jim Chee, but also is afraid to express her love due to the same fear.  We have the now retired &quot;legendary Lieutenant&quot; with his ever-present maps and his analytical mind.  It's always a pleasure to meet these three again.<br />We have a powerful businessman/criminal with money, political connections, and evil intentions who won't let anything or anyone stand in his way.  We have a couple of ex-C.I.A. agents, one who is operating incognito and is murdered almost as the book opens, and the other who is working for our amoral rich man.<br />Throw all of these characters into a pot and mix them with the search for 40 billion or so dollars of missing royalties never paid to various indigenous tribes, the C.I.A. man's murder, and a drug smuggling plot, and you have a mystery (or perhaps mysteries) that requires the best of Leaphorn's analytical abilities and Chee's intuition to begin to get to the bottom of things.<br />Well, that's the plot in a nutshell, and it does make a story well worth reading, but, there is something missing that I have come to anticipate in Hillerman's novels.  In the majority of his previous novels, he included, as an integral part of the plots, information that is not widely known about Navajo, or occasionally Hopi, customs, mythological history, and religious rites.  I always felt that I was getting a cultural education as well as reading a good mystery.  This unique aspect of his previous books was missing here, and I, for one, missed that aspect of his knowledge that he usually shares with us.<br />Even with the unique aspect of his writing missing, __THE SINISTER PIG__ is a novel worth reading.	2004-06-22

It is broken down geographically, and within each geographic area, it is further broken down into &quot;Attractions,&quot; &quot;Hotels,&quot; and &quot;Restaurant Chains.&quot;<br />Of particular value to parents is the fact that attractions are rated by their interest level for adults and, seperately, for children.<br />The way the book is laid out, it is convenient to use to plan a trip either around visiting major attractions s your starting point, or around finding attractions in a specific area that you might be visiting for other reasons.<br />There is a very handy section of Travel Tips for families with children that is from PARENT MAGAZINE.<br />There is also an extremely useful special feature index.  Again, it is useful to both adults traveling sans children and those with children.  For example you can find a listing of Hotels or Attractions that provide educational opportunities, or parties for kids, or babysitting service, or which have cradles and cribs, or for the adults, Spa Treatments and/or Golf.  What makes these categories so useful is that they are categorized by the type of service offered with the hotels or attractions that provide the services listed alphabetically within each category.  Then, for more information, you can go to the appropriate geographical location for fill-in information, including pricing.<br />In my opinion, Zagat's &quot;U.S. Family Travel Guide&quot; just might be the one indispensible guide for family trip planning.	2004-06-10

Maybe not politically correct, but most assuredly a correct expression of the feelings of most parents.  They are reprinted, with permission, from several of the more popular family style magazines of the era.<br />There is a wonderful parody of \\"'Twas The Night Before Christmas\\" called \\"'Twas The Night (Late) Before Christmas\\" which describes a night spent doing everything a parent has to do after the kids are in bed on Christmas Eve:  Set up and decorate the tree, Fill the stockings, Clean up the mess made while decorating the tree, and, finally, assembling all those \\"easy to assemble toys.\\"  It ends up with this fervent plea:<br />. . . . \\"As we gazed at our efforts through lead-filled eyes<br />. . . . And thought of the morrow and shouts of surprise,<br />. . . . We prayed that the children, on the morn of St. Nick's<br />. . . . Would please not awaken at least until six!\\"<br />Most of the poems hint at love, but also express some of those other only too real feelings that parents have upon occasion.  One of these poems is about the phases a child goes through, saying essentially that you shouldn't wish for the current phase to end too soon, because the next one may be worse.<br />In another titled \\"Report Card Receiver,\\" Armour describes the wonderful, attentive, obedient, scholarly student that he believes his child to be, based of course on his child's description of himself.  It ends as follows:<br />. . . . \\"Or so I thought, from what he told me,<br />. . . . But what a bill of goods he sold me!\\"<br />There are about 3 dozen poems, most in the same vein as these, and reading them does make you realize that you aren't the only one who has these ambivalent feelings.<br />Additional features are the drawings on almost every page by Leo Hershfield, and an introduction by Phyllis McGinley.<br />Reading aloud to your spouse from this book, after you've finally gotten the children tucked in for the night, and have answered the last request for one sort of service or another, (for example: \\"Daddy, I need a drink of water.\\") might be a better way to relax than a stiff drink.	2004-06-09

One of the things that, in my opinion, makes any reference book better, is how it is laid out, and how easily one can cross reference various entries.  This is a book that meets those criteria.<br />First, all 4000+ entries are in plain alphabetical order;  Second, there is an index by subject; and third, there is am index of people.  Each of these is broken down into the same half dozen or so sub categories.  For instance:  if you wanted some information on philosophers and philosophical ideas, you would look under the category of &quot;MIND AND BELIEF&quot; in both the subject and people indexes.  Under People you will find Philosophers and under Subject you will find Philosophy.  Then under each of these you will find hundreds of entries which are in the main portion of the book alphabetically.  (Of course, if you already knew the name of the person you wanted to research, you would go directly to the alphabetical listing, bypassing the indexes completely.)<br />Each individual entry in the alphabetical index gives a few paragraph discussion of the particular subject under review.<br />Before someone complains that there's not enough detail given on a particular idea or person, I only have this to say, as in any dictionary or encyclopedia which covers a wide range of subjects, only a few key facts can be listed under each.  If someone needs more detailed information, there are whole texts, or volumes of texts, devoted to most of the entries here.  Also, since there are only 4000 entries, not everyone's favorite subject will make it.<br />Just scanning the book, I have learned more about several subjects than I ever knew.  As an example, I found out that there are two St. Augustine's, the one who was a prolific writer and religious philosopher, in the 4th to 5th centuries A.D., and one who was a Bishop a couple of hundred years later.  Or, keeping to the Saints for a moment, a Saint that all of us who use Amazon should be aware of is Saint John of God, who is theSaint of the book trade.<br />As an example of a more contemporary entry, there is a discussion of &quot;morphing&quot; as it relates to computer generated changes from one image to another, think of the transformation of a human into &quot;the wolfman&quot; as done by computer in a series of continous minor changes resulting in a completely different image.  A whole lot easier than the painful make up jobs that the original screen wolfman had to go through,<br />There are also a series of articles or short essays inserted sort of like an op-ed page, opposite the alphabetical entry on the same subject, and, finally, there are revelant quotes inserted in boxes on pages where they are applicable.  An example of this is a quote from Abraham Lincoln, &quot;The ballot is stronger than the bullet.&quot; which appears following the discussion of democracy.<br />In my opinion, this is another very useful reference book.	2004-06-06

If we haven't read them, we, of previous generations, have probably seen the movie of his life starring Danny Kaye, and any child who watches television has probably seen a Disney version of \\"The Ugly Duckling.\\"<br />While these, and similar productions are entertaining, they \\"prettify\\" his stories.  what I mean by this is that many of his tales have very sad endings and/or have dark gloomy atmospheres.  Not all, but many.<br />For example, \\"The Little Match Girl\\" tells the tale of a poverty stricken child whose father sends her out on a freezing New Year's Eve to sell matchsticks.  She is afraid to come home without having made any money, as her father will punish her.  As the night grows colder, she lights the matchsticks one by one for a drop of warmth.  In the flare of each match, she sees visions of her grandmother in heaven, and with the last match her grandmother descends from heaven and takes the little girl in her arms.  In the morning, her frozen body is found.<br />In \\"The Red Shoes,\\" a little girl is given a pair of red shoes which she feels are the most wonderful things in the world, she values them above everyone and everything, and even at her own communion can think of nothing other than how beautiful she looks in her red shoes.  These shoes prove to be her death, as they cause her to dance for days on end until she finally had to have the executioner chop off her feet so she could stop dancing.  Then, and only then, with stumps for feet, did she repent for her conceit.  As in many of Andersen's fairy tales there is an obvious moral here.<br />Some other old favorites such as \\"The Ugly Duckling\\" and the Emperor's New Clothes\\" are included.<br />I think that this is a very good English translation of the included tales, but what makes this book stand out are Arthur Szck's illustrations.  There is no copyright date in my copy, but I'm sure it is over 50 years old, and even so, Szck's color illustrations are each and every one worthy of framing.  In bright, bold colors, and frequently with an oriental feeling, they are just plain wonderful.  I fell in love with them, and I'd bet that most readers would too.	2004-06-03

Parker type of detective, who gives and receives beatings and often strongarms confessions out of the frequently violent criminals.<br />Another thing I noticed in most of the stories from England was the fact that, where there was a murder, it usually took place \\"off stage\\" or had happened before the story opened.  In the American version we frequently see the grisly doings as they happen.<br />I was familiar with some of these authors, Arthur Conan Doyle, Ruth Rendell, Agatha Christie, Ngaio Marsh, and Dorothy Sayers to name a few.  I was also introduced to a number of authors I had never read, even though their stories spanned a period from before my birth to fairly modern times.<br />To pick just one story to discuss, I settled on Ngaio Marsh's \\"Death on the Air\\" in which a \\"wireless\\" buff was electrocuted while tuning his very early model radio.  This in a period where you had to manipulate two dials at the same time to bring in a signal.  The electrocution was supposed to look accidental, but . . . .<br />Our detective and his police aids bring the case to its conclusion by detective work that seems very crude compared to our modern methods, which is coupled with some very insightful questioning of family members and friends of the deceased.  Their methods prove every bit as effective as our modern ones which include DNA Testing, Computer analysis, etc.  There was actually more pure intellect involved in many of the older stories that there is in many modern mysteries.<br />You might not like all the stories included in this book, but there are enough very good, very insightful tales to interest almost any mystery buff.	2004-05-06

They are, in fact, people who have stayed at the resorts or hotels being rated, people who have stayed there, eaten there, used the facilities such as pools and spas, and who have experienced the hotels' service, both good, bad, and indifferent, and have no vested interest in reporting what they like or dislike.<br />Propertiy ratings cover the following categories:  Rooms, Service, Dining, and Public Space.  Costs given are the high season rack rates for standard double rooms.  Since the ratings are averages of a great number of responses, individual biases probably don't affect them very much.<br />Properties are listed by country, city within the country, where applicable, and then in alphabetical order.<br />For convenience, there are a great number of cross references such as: Golf, Hiking, Historical Interest, Pet-Friendly, etc., and even by availability of Fireplaces.<br />Comments are those of people who have stayed in the properties, and range from raves to \\"rants.\\"<br />All in all, If you are looking for an upper end hotel or resort almost anywhere in the world, this Zagat Survey should be of help.	2004-04-14

In past novels, and through most of this one, he has always been able to depend on &quot;Mouse&quot; to back him up.  But, by the conclusion of this novel, he is on his own for the first time.<br />As readers of any previous Easy Rawlins novels know, &quot;Mouse&quot; would just as soon kill anyone as say hello to them, and this tendency, while getting him into a lot of trouble, has made many situations easier for Easy.  No one has ever wanted to take on &quot;Mouse&quot; and consequently, the &quot;bad guys&quot; have kept their distance from Easy too.<br />Alas, this will be no more.  The newly reformed &quot;Mouse,&quot; on one last adventure with Easy, gets shot while saving Easy's life one more time.  His wounds prove to be fatal.<br />The plot itself is a bit convoluted.  Easy, who has left the street life and has been working for a few years as head of Janitorial services at Sojourner Truth Junior High School, is forced to save his reputation, his job, and his life because of three murders involving a teacher at his school, her husband, and her brother-in-law, several thefts of school property, and some missing smuggled heroin.  While trying to help the teacher after the murder of her brother-in-law, Easy becomes a suspect in that and the following murders.  For good measure, someone is trying to set him up as chief suspect in those thefts of valuable equipment from several schools.  After all, as head of the custodians, he does have keys to all the secure areas.<br />If you've read any of Mosley's other books, you know that Easy is going to take a few beatings and his life will be in danger more than once.<br />The trail to the conclusion of _A LITTLE YELLOW DOG_ is long and tortuous  The book has to be read to follow and understand Easy's approach to solving the multiple murders.  Oh yes, I almostforgot, there really is a little yellow dog.  He seems to love everyone except Easy, and amazingly enough, his animosity turns into a great big plus for Easy, but you'll have to find out how for yourself.	2004-04-12

Question:  When is a puppet not a puppet?<br />Answer:  When it's a corpse, of course!<br />Yes, In MacLean's _PUPPET ON A STRING_ this was one method that a psychopathic killer used to make his point -- his point being don't try to catch me or &quot;this&quot; could happen to you.  &quot;This&quot; being your body hanging from a hook through your neck from a third story flagpole projected out over the street.  Gruesome, huh?<br />The plot revolved around the efforts of Col. Sherman, an Interpol agent, to find and eliminate a major drug supplier in Amsterdam.  Our psychopathic killer was a prominent player in, but not the &quot;mastermind&quot; of the drug distributors.<br />At times during this book, I wondered how Col. Sherman had survived as long as he had.  On at least three occasions he was careless enough to get captured, severely beaten, and almost killed.  Only a combination of a lot of luck and last second help from unexpected places kept him alive.  He also made enough serious mistakes and overlooked the obvious with such frequency that his friends and aides often found themselves in serious trouble or, worse, turned up dead.<br />Those are the weak points.  On the other hand, Sherman was remarkably resilient, and came out of each failure a little closer to finding out who was running the show and what ingenious methods were being used to smuggle the world's largest supply of heroin into those countries where it brought the highest prices.<br />The action was non-stop, and, at least to this reader, the ending did come as a surprise.  I could easily picture it as a spy thriller movie starring whoever is the &quot;star of the moment.&quot;<br />If you can suspend disbelief for a bit and just read _PUPPET ON A STRING_ as a fast paced thriller, I think you'll enjoy it in spite of a few &quot;aw come on, he must be smarter than that&quot; reactions.  I know that I did.	2004-04-07

The dozen interconnected short stories in Walter Moseley's _WALKIN' THE DOG_ do a lot more than just describe several incidents in the life of his protagonist, Socrates Fortlow.<br />Socrates, as many of the readers of this review probably already know, is an ex-convict who was convicted of murder(evidently a crime of passion -- his wife was in bed with his &quot;best friend&quot;), served his time, and is now trying to live out his life working an honest job as a grocery bagger, while serving as a mentor for a teen aged boy, and lovingly caring for his two legged dog, &quot;Killer.&quot;<br />A pervasive problem is that too many people, including a racist cop or two, just won't leave him or his conscience alone.  One very bad cop, in particular, has brutalized, raped, and murdered defenseless black victims.  In addressing this, Socrates does NOT resort to violence, but, wearing a sandwich board listing the rogue cops acts of violence, walks up and down across the street from a police station.  When people begin to take notice of him, the police order him to move.  He refuses because he believes his actions are legal. When the police try to remove him from the street using excess physical force a crowd including TV reporters and cameras shows up and a riot ensues.  Although Socrates is jailed and manhandled, he is released in three days With apologies from the mayor and police chief, and the rogue cop is let go.  In line with his personal philosophy, Socrates, having accomplished his self appointed mission, gives no interviews and does his best to disappear &quot;into the woodwork.&quot;<br />This episode is one of the 12 linked short stories in Mosely's novel.<br />Socrates, like his namesake, is a bit of a philosopher, but the kind who has more questions than answers.  One of the big questions that he has a strong need to deal with, revolves around his own anger.  He tries to deal with this omnipresent anger by participating in a discussion group and gradually bringing them around to a discussion of black anger in a white dominated society.<br />He does, when forced to, resort to what we might call physical violence, but only when severely provoked as in the case of a young, very physical, mugger who is determined to do Socrates severe bodily harm.  He does, but Socrated prevails by the end of the confrontation.<br />I felt that Mosely, in this book, gave me some insight into what life is like for poor members of an underclass (in his books, black) in a society that seems determined to keep the class structure status quo.  For this reason, along with its readability, I can recommend _WALKIN' THE DOG_ without reservation.	2004-04-06

In the early years, right after World War II, they were a couple of broke young men just embarking on what, for both of them, would prove to be very successful careers.  <br />Michener, as we know became a successful, Pulitzer Prize winning author of over 40 novels.  Some of his very early short stories were the basis of the musical, &quot;Sound of Music,&quot; which is still being performed today.<br />Silverman, who started out as a landscaper, founded the successful Sylvan Pools, and eventually became a major developer and owner of multiple large building projects.  He loved to take calculated risks and turn them into money.<br />Both ended up millionaires.<br />_MICHENER AND ME_ is equal parts memoir and correspondence, the correspondence mostly from Michener.  It makes no pretence of being a biography.  <br />There's no doubt about it, James Michener was a study in contrasts.  As described by Silverman, Michener could be generous one day to the tune of millions, and a penny pincher the next, refusing to help out a friend who needed a small loan.  He also often seemed to be lacking in the basic social graces.  On more than one occasion, he arrived at the Silverman's home, walked through a room full of guests without acknowledging anyone, went into the den, closed the door, and turned on the television.  Silverman attributes this to shyness, his wife believes that Michener was downright rude.<br />A lot of this behaviour really is explainable, however.  Michener grew up in a fatherless home.  He didn't know who his father was, and later in life came to believe that his mother really wasn't his mother at all.  He described himself as a foundling.  His mother took in washing and often had to farm him out to an Aunt who ran the local poor house.  He would see old people enter the poor house with almost no belongings and no money.  One or more of these poverty stricken people warned him to never lethimself get into a condition where he couldn't take care of himself financially.  He never forgot these old people, and never, no matter how rich and successful he became, got over his fear of poverty.<br />Typical of his contrasting attitudes relative to money:  Over a lifetime, he accumulated several homes in different areas that mostly sat empty and deteriorated, but he didn't use them or sell them.  He literally forgot about them and the money tied up in them.  On the opposite side of the coin, he and his wife, when staying in a hotel, would make sure they got the senior discount of a fee dollars, even though they were worth millions.<br />Through the flow of the book, we come to understand that much of this behaviour was absolutely due to the lasting effects of his solitary, poverty stricken, boyhood.<br />He gave millions to various charities, foundations, etc.  He evolved from an Eisenhower Republican to a Liberal Democrat.  He ran for Congress as a Democrat in a conservative Republican district and lost.  It wasn't even close.  He served on boards of museums and foundations, donating hours of his time, and would tirelessly autograph books to help a friend with a small bookshop.  <br />What is hard to explain is how the friendship between Michener and the outgoing Silverman managed to survive so many differences, and how so many of Michener's better instincts were influenced by both the efforts and the examples of Silverman. <br />This relationship is best described in his descriptions of  their years of weekend trips together, their long discussions on politics, business, and mutual plans, their weekly telephone calls, and Silverman's emotional support during Michener's final illness.  To get a feel for this relationship, which is what this book is all about, you'd need to read the book.  It does give a different sort of insight from the many Michener biographies available.	2004-02-05

Neither will you find deep philosophical discussions exploring the multiple levels of an author's intent.  I say this only because in some reviews of other reference books in the New York Public Library collection, some reviewers have complained that some favorite item of theirs was not included.  To summarize this paragraph, there's a lot here for most people, but not everything for everyone.<br />What you will find are a great number of literary references broken down into a little over a dozen general categories.  For instance, under &quot;Authors,&quot; there are a couple of hundred two columned pages of brief discussions of authors and their key works.<br />Under &quot;Works of Literature,&quot; you will find almost as many discussions of novels, plays, poetry and other forms of written works.<br />One of my favorite sections is &quot;Characters.&quot;  Has the name of some literary character ever come up in a conversation and you can't quite remember where he or she came from?  This is the easiest reference I've ever found for obtaining that sort of answer.<br />In addition there are such sections as &quot;Literary Awards&quot;, &quot;Great Book&quot; lists, &quot;Literary Periodals,&quot; a &quot;Dictionary of Literature,&quot; a &quot;Chronology of Literature,&quot; and many more convenient breakdowns.<br />Overall, of course, there is a general index which includes all entries in all categories, and which serves as a sort of cross reference between the various categories.<br />As a previous reviewer has noted, this is a great book to open up at any page and browse to your heart's content.  I find myself looking up one item and then following it up with another reference mentioned in that one, and on and on, ad infinitum.<br />From the day I found this book, it has been one of the most used reference book in my collection.	2004-01-28

For these reasons, I'm not even sure why I read his _ON WRITING_.  However, I did read it, and I'm glad that I did.<br />The section devoted to his youthful experiences hit close to home for me.  Since I feel as if I shared a lot of his childhood angst,  I found this mini-bio appealing.   <br />I believe that _ON WRITING_ can't quite be looked at as two separate books in the way that many reviewers, both editorial and contributing, feel that it is.  It seems to me that the craftsmanship portion of the book is a logical follow on to the life experiences covered in the first section.  I also feel that the third section of the book, which discusses his almost fatal accident and his period of convalescence, is an integral part of the whole narrative.  By this, I mean that coping with his painful recovery helped him over his \\"writer's block\\" and that forcing himself to write again aided his recovery.  <br />_ON WRITING_ also contains a lot of information that you just don't find in most books about the nuts and bolts of writing.  An example of this is his \\"composite\\" unpublished writer who recognizes the need of an agent and goes about preparing to find one the right way, i.e. first by writing, submitting, and getting, as would be expected, a lot of rejection slips -- then by not getting discouraged by these rejections and continuing to write and submit his stories -- by recognizing the importance to a beginner of the \\"little magazines\\" -- by continuing to submit, taking note of the comments on some rejection slips, and eventually getting a few acceptances  -- then by parlaying these acceptances into items on a resume and using this resume to obtain a good agent.  The details of how this might be done make the book valuable, even if you were to get nothing else out of it.  <br />You will, however, get other things out of it.  For instance, you'll find that adverb is a \\"dirty word,\\" and that adverbs should almost always be avoided.  King also reminds us that sentence structure, paragraphing, good grammar and proper punctuation are valuable tools, as are neatness, professionalism of approach, and, something he learned from an early rejection, staples are no-no's.  Oh, yes, there's also the \\"10% rule\\" that you'll find interesting and valuable<br />I could go on, but King is one heck of a lot better at expressing these and other ideas than I'll ever be, so I really would advise the early-career writer to read _ON WRITING_ by Stephen King.<br />Since I'm not one of the writing hopefuls for whom the book was written, I won't worry too much if this review violates a half dozen or so of the guidelines for good writing, although I have attempted to do a competent writing job.  (Also see his discussion of \\"Hacks\\" vs. \\"Competent Writers\\" vs. \\"Good Writers.\\"  It's another concept that I have not seen elsewhere.	2004-01-22

WELL, MAYBE	_MURDER TAKES A HOLIDAY_ is an anthology of sixteen short stories with the unifying theme of murders that take place while the victim is on vacation.  As in any anthology, some stories are of higher quality than others, but, I'm glad to say, none of them bored me, and several intrigued me.<br />I have to admit that I was not familiar with many of the authors, Arthur Conan Doyle and G.K. Chesterton being the most notable exceptions.<br />There are murders that take place during a honeymoon on a remote Greek Island, on a luxury bus tour, on a cruise ship, in a remote English village, on the seashore, in a vacation cottage, and almost anywhere else one might go on vacation, or on holiday, as our English cousins say.<br />One story I was particularly taken with was &quot;Death in Guatemala&quot; by Frances Crane.  This is one of those stories where I, and I would guess anyone else who reads it, cheers when the victim, Evelyn, gets here comeuppance.  She is a condescending user of people, particularly her old friend whom she invites to come along on her vacation with her and her husband.  She (Evelyn) treats her rather passive friend horribly, and positively gloats when she thinks she has gotten the better of a native in the local marketplace.  When her end comes, nobody misses her, not her husband, not her friend, and certainly not me, the reader.<br />In other stories, the victims run the gamut from sympathetic characters about whom we care to good old fashioned &quot;nasties&quot; who just won't be missed.<br />_MURDER TAKES A HOLIDAY_ is the kind of light book that makes great reading while soaking up a few rays at the seashore while on vacation.  Unless, of course, you're superstitious.	2004-01-20

Books	4	5	5	N	N	STORIES THAT SPAN BRADBURY'S CAREER	By reading the information on the copyright page, the reader will note that the stories in this book have been culled from over a half dozen publications, possibly many more.  As such, it seems reasonable to assume that they were written over a span of a great number of years.  I would have found it helpful had the original copyright dates of each entry been included so one could, in some ways, track Bradbury's development as a writer.<br />Having said that, I did enjoy this book for the very variety that seems to have put off some of the reviewers here.  There are stories that are pure Sci-Fi, others that are perfect examples of the horror genre, some that make us want to laugh and/or cry, and many that combine several of these aspects.<br />One of the latter that I found particularly moving is &quot;Lafayette, Farewell.&quot;  In it, an elderly man who knows that he is to die soon begins to relive the air battles he fought as a fighter pilot over France during World War I.  Every night, he sees and hears the planes of those brave young men who died as he successfully shot their planes out of the sky.  He now feels guilty over taking the lives of those innocent young pilots who, like himself, were sent into a war not of their own making.<br />He fears that he will be consigned to hell for what he has done, and he asks his neighbor how he can, at this late date, be forgiven.  His neighbor suggests that, since they, in their planes, are appearing over his house nightly before parachuting to their deaths in his back yard, he plainly and simply, ask them for their forgiveness.  In a very moving scene, he does just that and they indicate that he is forgiven.<br />This is really a touching story, one of my favorites in the book.  There are others equally rewarding to read along with some that are among Bradbury's lesser works.  I for one, am glad to see as many of Bradbury's stories as possible anthologized in books such as _THE TOYNBEE CONVECTOR_.  I'm afraid that those that aren't, and which appeared in more obscure, older Sci-Fi magazines, may be lost to us forever.  In my opinion, all of his writing is worth preserving for readers of the future.that aren't, and which appeared in more obscure, older Sci-Fi magazines, may be lost to us forever.

Yes, in many ways our heroine, Boston P. I. (Private Investigator) Sunny Randal, is similar to Spenser. Additionally, many comparisons can also be made between their respective supporting casts.  Even their speech patterns are remarkably similar, but why not?  After all, they are both Robert B. Parker's creations.  Now that we've taken care of that, let's move on to the plot.  <br />In _PERISH TWICE_, before we even get to the criminal stuff, we need to address several other things going on in Sunny's life.  First there's her sister, Elizabeth, for whom any aspect of dealing with real life is just too overwhelming.  Elizabeth's husband has been having an affair (as who wouldn't, thinks Sunny).  She has left him and has begun to take her revenge by stalking him and his woman friend.  Even though she resents Sunny's help, and her need for it, Elizabeth looks to Sunny to make everything okay, an impossible task, given Elizabeth's faulty coping mechanisms.<br />Second, there's Sunny's friend Julie, a therapist who needs to see a therapist.  Julie's marriage and life are unraveling, and she looks to Sunny for emotional support until she can get her act together.<br />Third there's Sunny's own life in which she is still adjusting to her divorce from, but continued relationship with, her ex-husband, a man she really likes.  <br />While these three things are going on, Sunny gets involved with some of the stuff in which Private Investigators (P.I.'s) are supposed to get involved.  Here's the detecting stuff:  <br />A lesbian employee of a firm that offers guidance counselling to women only, is murdered while the murderee's boss is being stalked by a rather repulsive male who evidently has had an affair with the boss, even though she also professes to be a man hating lesbian.  This series of events sets the stage for what's to follow.<br />What's to follow is that said repulsive male is found dead of a bullet shot through the mouth.  Alongside his body is a suicide note, signed in his own handwriting, in which he confesses that he is the murderer of the aforementioned murderee.  This note conveniently clears a murder case off the books -- or does it?  Our intrepid P.I. thinks not, and so continues her investigation into the murder and the convenient suicide which might not be a suicide at all, or so she believes.<br />As her investigation continues, a few cages are rattled, cages that some people feel shouldn't be rattled.  Next, a second level prostitution ring \\"manager\\" (pimp in charge of other pimps) attempts to kill her.  Being the resourceful P.I. that she is, Sunny turns the tables on him, and causes him to be sent to prison where, shortly thereafter, he is murdered by persons unknown.<br />Another coincidence?  Not in Sunny's opinion.  In fighting crime, there are no coincidences, one just needs to find the connections.<br />Want to know if Sunny does figure out how these murders are tied together, and how she wraps up all of these personal and whodunnit threads?  If I've done my self appointed job well, you'll want to read the book and find out.  Good reading!	2004-01-15

This book has just enough of each for me to give it, what certain TV movie critics call a &quot;reluctant, or borderline, thumbs up.&quot;  Franken has certainly done better in other books.<br />Sometimes I just can't figure out if he really means for us to take the advice he gives seriously, or if it is the bad advice he has promised to occasionally slip in, or if it is, purely and simply, an attempt at comedy.  Hence my ambivalence.<br />For the moment, I am going to concentrate on some of the more meaningful of his comments:  In a chapter titled &quot;Oh The Loneliness, The Loneliness,&quot;  he comments that we are born alone and that we die alone, even though we may be surrounded, in both cases, by family and friends.  Unfortunately, this truly describes the human condition, and the happy man or woman is one who has learned to accommodate this existential (my description, not his) loneliness.<br />Another bit of good advice is that we should prepare for our declining years by anticipating the possibility for the future need of a nursing home or &quot;assisted living facility,&quot; and check them out and pick one that we might like if we ever need one.  This should be done while we are still young enough to make a valid assessment.<br />These are just two exmples of the better advice he gives.<br />Of lesser value are things like his discussion of the &quot;inevitable&quot; really horrible experiences during the middle years of a marriage.  He apologizes to his wife in the afterword, but I think that, even if these chapters were meant to be humorous, they missed the boat.<br />I also found his advice that one must pick a religion in order to get through the tougher parts of life to be less than valid.  He never seems to have considered such secular answers to life's so-called mysteries as Humanism.  One can get through life's downs without resorting to answers from the god of his or her choice.  Thus, it is my opinion that there are other ways to get survive these tough times than by resorting to an organized religion. He also has listed modern religions in order of usefulness.  These rankings might be subject to questioning.<br />In summary then, the better and poorer suggestions tend to counterbalance one another, and the discerning reader will probably find some ideas that are of use to him or her.g to answers from the god of his or her choice.

He comes on the scene in the very early years of the Russian Revolution as an avid revolutionary.  Even though he is Jewish, and Jews are looked on as part of the &quot;internationalist&quot; enemies, he rises high in the Communist hierarchy and somehow manages to survive all of the Stalinist purges.  No one knows quite why, but he is, arguably, the highest ranking of the original revolutionaries except, of course, Stalin, himself, to do so.  No matter what horrors are the responsibility of Stalin or his successors, Solomon always believes that they are necessary aspects of &quot;The Revolution.&quot;  Even when he and his family suffer from these excesses, he retains his faith in his leaders and their actions.  In fact, when Stalin is denounced after his death, Solomon's attitude is that Stalin did what was necesary during his time, and the later leaders are now doing what must be done now.  Like so many zealots, even those of the present time, he believes that whatever is done in the name of the cause is right.<br />For purposes of this family history, this belief comes to a head when he, for all purposes, disowns his son, Volodya, for wanting to emigrate out of the U.S.S.R. to Israel.<br />The government, using as an excuse that Volodya has worked in a field where he &quot;knows secrets,&quot; refuses him permission to leave.  Volodya and his wife, Masha, become activists, working on behalf of those Jews refused permission to emigrate.  Because of these activities, Volodya loses one job after another, is exiled to an unliveable part of Siberia for five years, and is frequently imprisoned.  All of this does serious damage to his health, but he perseveres.  By these actions, he gains international fame and is partially responsible for thousands of other Jews being allowed to exit, even though he is still denied an exit visa.<br />Potok's book vividly describes the horrors of these years, and serves as both a family chronicle and a history of the Jewish people in Russia, ranging from the horrors suffered under the Tsars, to the further horrors suffered under the followers of Lenin.<br />In many ways this book is a history of the abuses that accompany absolute power and those that go along with rule by zealots of any persuasion.  <br />As an aside, _THE GATES OF NOVEMBER_ does end on a high note.  Volodya and Masha are finally allowed to leave, and do live out their lives in freedom.	2004-01-04

As Thomas describes it, Joe senior, the ex-bootlegger millionaire, had ambitions for his sons.  These ambitions were first centered around his eldest son, Joe junior, his first born.  This son was to be President of the United States.  Because Joe (the father) only showed his love through praise for major achievements, and believed that winning was everything, his sons had become highly competitive with one another.  This competitiveness probably caused Joe juniors death in WWII.  It seems that number two son, John (Jack), had a war experience that dad had enhanced  to make it seem a much greater act of heroism than it actually was.  In order to outdo his younger brother, Joe junior volunteered for an extremely dangerous mission, one which cost him his life.<br />Although he grieved, Joe senior wasted no time in switching his plans to his second son, Jack, and eventually did succeed in getting Jack elected President.<br />One might ask where Robert was all this time.  As &quot;little brother,&quot;  little in both stature and in importance in the family, his job was to help out his big brother.  This was the only way he could get dad's attention, and rarely, an expression of approval.<br />Robert did his job and did it well, but for many years, no matter how many scrapes he got Jack out of, went unappreciated.  He finally did come into his own during the period of the Cuban Missile Crisis, when it was his advice that his brother, the Presidnt followed, and which worked.  from this point on, he was accepted as a near equal.<br />It had been a long struggle, but he had finally become important in the family hierarchy and eventually was to earn his father's grudging respect.<br />The story of his political career from the &quot;red-baiting&quot; advisor to Joe McCarthy, to the overzealous &quot;crime buster,&quot; through the changes that led him to be a spokesman for the underpriveleged, to his campaign for the Presidency in his own right, and, finally, to his assassination, is well known so I won't dwell on the details here.<br />Robert Kennedy's true struggle in life was to be a son who was loved by his domineering father.  I believe, and Thomas so indicates, that he was finally successful in doing this.  From &quot;runt of the litter&quot; to a socially conscious, &quot;probably would have been successful Presidential Candidate,&quot; he came a long way.  After reading Thomas' biography, you come away feeling that the nation was made significantly poorer by Robert Kennedy's assisination.	2003-12-22
US	50368037	REN2VUOB90J1Z	0312925174	641302858	Bad Company	Books	4	9	10	N	N	A CASE OF VERY POOR JUDGMENT	First a little background information about the main players in this tale of cocaine, murder, egos, and Showbiz &quot;wannabes&quot; and &quot;ustawuzes.&quot;<br />For starters there was Roy Radin, a modern day, but old fashioned, vaudeville entrepeneur.  Radin got very rich producing vaudeville type productions that traveled a circuit of medium sized midwestern cities and towns as fund raisers for such organizations as police benevolent societies.  The sponsoring societies did make money, but Radin usually made more.  His shows and audiences were the sort that usually gave more applause and greater laughter to the trained dog act than to well-known entertainer, Joey Bishop.<br />Oh, yes, Radin was also a binge eater and user of cocaine.  These little habits often consumed a big part of his income.<br />The second major player in this drama was Karen &quot;Laney&quot; Jacobs, later Laney Greenberger.  It is a matter of public record, from her later pre-trial hearings, that Laney was a major cocaine distributor who did business with some very vicious people, and who ended up on trial herself for a very vicious murder.<br />A third player, key to our story, was Robert Evans, a Hollywood movie producer who had produced some very successful movies but who, during the period covered by this book, was somewhat down on his luck.<br />Additional players were various drug traffickers, dealers, gangsters, and hit men, as well as Laney's last husband, Larry Greenberger, who either was a retired businessman or a major player in the drug trade, depending on whose testimony one chooses to believe.<br />It would seem that both Radin and Laney (then Greenberger) wanted to get into the legitimate movie producing business.  To facilitate this desire, Laney introduced Radin to Robert Evans who had the rights to produce the movie &quot;Cotton Club,&quot; but who was unable, at that time, to get financing through normal channels.  Radin, through use of his own money, and money from other sources, could provide this much needed financial backing.  <br />Laney's idea, when she made the introduction, was to form a production company consisting of Evans, Radin, and herself.  This is the point where Radin made his very serious error in judgment.  He decided to cut Laney out of the deal and to only pay her a $50,000 finder's fee.  Laney didn't take kindly to this snub. Being a principal in the procuction company that made this film would have made her &quot;someone&quot; in Hollywood, and potentially could have been very profitable to the tune of millions.  <br />She didn't take this sort of thing lightly.  One evening, she set up a dinner meeting with Radin to &quot;discuss&quot; their differences.  He was last seen alive getting into her limousine.  A month later his badly decomposed body was discovered,  It had multiple bullet holes in the head.<br />Her last husband was also guilty of using poor judgment, which evidently caused Laney to become angry with him.  One day, with Laney upstairs in their large estate home in Florida, He managed to commit suicide in a most unusual manner.  With a large caliber gun in his right hand, he somehow shot himself in the left temple with powder marks that indicated that, in addition to this unusual way of shooting himself on the wrong side of the head, he had managed to do it from six to eight feet away.  Very long arms?  He also managed to hold onto the gun, with his finger still on the trigger, even though the recoil should have caused him to drop it.  A most amazing form of suicide.  <br />Since Laney was charged with Radin's murder and expedited to California, the investigation of this most unusual suicide was never completed.<br />This all goes to show that, when dealing with a no-nonsense, tough as nails, female drug dealer, one really should try to use some degree of discretion.	2003-12-21

Cohan<br />1924:   Edna Ferber, Rebecca West, and Will Rogers<br />1929:   Robinson Jeffers<br />1931:   Walter Disney (He hadn't become Walt yet)<br />1935:   Thomas Wolfe, Clifford Odets and Igor Stravinsky<br />There were lists for every year from 1919 to 1935.<br />One of my favorite articles from 1931 was titled \\"Impossible Interviews.\\"  It included dialog from these pseudo interviews along with hand drawn colored caricatures of the participants.  The two interviews included here were \\"John D. Rockefeller, senior (sic) versus Joe Stalin\\" and \\"Greta Garbo versus Calvin Coolidge.\\"<br />A 1930 article, \\"The Art of Dying,\\"  which discusses how people die, their last words, and their attitudes towards death, is as pertinent today as it was over 70 years ago.<br />Another article, this by Aldous Huxley, titled \\"The importance of the Comic Genious,\\" talks about how few are the examples of comic genius in the arts, when compared to the many examples of genius of more serious type.  Huxley mentions especially, Chaucer, Rabelais, Shakespeare's 'Falstaff,' and several others including some Dickens characters, in addition to the pictorial works of Daumier and Goya.  He then goes on to discuss why these areworks of genius, and how difficult it is to portray this sort of serio-comedy.<br />Article after article, work of fiction upon work of fiction, poems, photographs. illustrations, and biographical cameos fill this coffee table sized book of over 3oo pages with articles of nostalgia that make me wish that I could have been around then.	2003-12-21

All 66 stories do have one thing in common, a murder was committed, or at least attempted.  Some are traditional mysteries involving some sort of sleuth putting together various clues and solving the crime.  Others fall into the category of ghost stories or horror tales.  Yet others could be rightly called science fiction tales, or even very traditional fiction where a murder just happens.<br />Authors range from traditional mystery writers such as Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle to more contemporary authors such as P. D. James, Dorothy Sayers, and John D. McDonald, and to writers better known for significantly different styles of writing such as John Steinbeck, Rudyard Kipling, and Bram Stoker.<br />Steinbeck's story, \\"The Murder,\\" is, as it's title implies, about a murder but it isn't what one thinks of as a mystery.  Bram Stoker's \\"The Secret of Growing Gold\\" is an old fashioned horror tale.  I don't quite know how to describe Robert Graves' \\"Earth to Earth\\" other than to say, it is well worth reading.<br />There are also a great number of stories by less well-known authors, but the editors have been thoughtful in selecting , for the most part, high quality , highly readable works.<br />As is the case with many anthologies, this one has the advantage of being a book that one can pick up for a half an hour, or so, and read a complete story or two.  Occasionally, it's kind of nice to be able to put a book down, and go back to it later without needing to back up two or three pages in order to figure out just what was happening when you put it down.<br />I felt that the stories here were both good mystery and good literature.  I can't say that for a lot of books.	2003-12-20

I have read 3 of them, just enough to become familiar with Spenser, Hawk, and Susan, but not so many that they have become stale characters, or that Parker's plots have become repetitive.<br />Any number of previous reviews have discussed the plot in great detail.  In order not to be repetitious, my review will just discuss the plot in barest outline form and then will talk about the main protagonists, their interactions and characteristics.<br />The plot:  Spenser takes on a case for a young actress who wants to find out who killed her mother in a bank hold-up some 28 years earlier.  In spite of a cold trail, missing documents,and threats on his life, Spenser, with the physical support of his friend, Hawk, and the emotional and analytical support of his lover, Susan, soon finds out enough to make his investigation dangerous to both the FBI, and the most powerful mob figure in Boston, thus making it dangerous to Spenser.  It also turns out that what he is uncovering is NOT what his client wants to hear.  For the final outcome of this case, I guess that you'll just have to read the book.<br />Now for the promised character studies:  Spenser and his ally, Hawk, form quite a duo.  They are both in superb physical condition and can handle anyone who tries to intimidate them.  Spenser, alone can handle (read manhandle) at least two or three assailants by himself.  So, for that matter, can Hawk.<br />Together they can out think, out strategize, and out shoot just about anyone.  In at least one case, where Spenser is caught off guard, he also proves that he can outrun just about anyone before turning the tables on them.<br />Hawk and Spenser are not just dumb mugs, between them they can quote from Shakespeare, are students of ancient and modern history, and have a philosophical bent.<br />Susan provides a softer side, but only when softness is appropriate.  She is supportive even when Spenser and Hawk need to kill, as long as the killing is necessary to save their own lives.<br />To give Spenser and Hawk credit, they'd rather work out an amicable settlement than to resort to violence, if, of course, their adversaries are amenable to a peaceful settlement.<br />If you like your Private Investigators to be men of terse dialog (a la Hemingway), with a touch of introspection thrown in, I think that you'll really enjoy this novel.	2003-12-19

TO PRINT	It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that Quirk has a background as reporter for, and editor of, various fan magazines.  His penchant for juicy gossip would fit well in any tabloid publication.<br />I don't think that a single bit of gossip about the Kennedys, starting with patriarch, Joe Sr., and continuing down through the present generation has been overlooked by Quirk.  He also hasn't missed an opportunity to do a little self aggrandizement when he can work it in.  An example:  One of the main reasons Joe Kennedy pursued Gloria Swanson was because he was jealous of Quirk's Uncle Jimmie Quirk, who had married a famous and beautiful movie star.  According to our Quirk, (the author Lawrence), Kennedy the elder had an obsessive need to outdo Uncle Jimmie, so Kennedy went after, and landed an even more famous star, Gloria Swanson.  Also, according to Quirk, the elder Kennedy wasn't just satisfied to have an affair with Swanson, he also got her involved in a business deal that went sour.  When their business deal failed, he managed to arrange it so she was left with all the debts (leaving her practically destitute) before he walked away, free and clear.<br />Again, according to Quirk, Joe Sr. had many more affairs which his wife, Rose, politely ignored, thus setting the example that many future Kennedy wives followed.  See the book for examples of this wifely behaviour.<br />Joe's male offsprings, and the husbands of his daughters followed suit, says Quirk.<br />He tells us that son-in-law Peter Lawford was bisexual. amd wasn't quite manly enough to really make it socially with Joe's sons.  Lawford went through life trying to win their favor by acting as chief procurer of feminine company for Jack and Bobbie, always feeling inferior, resentful, and unappreciated.<br />Each son had his own pecadillos, too many to list here, but not one was spared by Quirk in this gossip fest.<br />Quirk, of course, always quoted sources for each of his tidbits, including occasionally citing himself in a previous publication, as the source.<br />As Quirk tells it, members of previous generations of his family played important roles in the affairs of the Kennedys.  <br />If you like the kind of materials you find in the tabloids, you'll enjoy __THE KENNEDYS IN HOLLYWOOD__.	2003-12-19

It would seem that Berlin could never rest on his laurels, but had a strong need to heap on success after success.  America's musical heritage is much the greater for this trait.<br />This same trait, however, was the cause of depression for Berlin whenever one of his musicals was panned by the critics, and several of them were.  I should add, however, that he had a great many more successes than failures.<br />Musically, his career spanned a period lasting from 1907 when he wrote the lyrics to &quot;Marie, from Sunny Italy,&quot; until 1966 when he wrote &quot;An Old Fashioned Wedding.&quot;<br />The song that really brought him fame was &quot;Alexander's Ragtime Band,&quot; first sung in 1911 by a then famous vaudeville star, Emma Carus.  This was the beginning of a long history of popular hit songs and musicals.<br />Some of his songs that have become a permanent part of the American musical repertoire are: &quot;White Christmas,&quot;  &quot;Easter Parade,&quot; and, of course, Kate Smith's rendition of &quot;God Bless America.&quot;  Interestingly, &quot;God Bless America&quot; had been a sort of throw-away song when it was written, not being sung at the time.  Many years after it was written, when Kate Smith needed a patriotic song in the World War II years, Berlin pulled it out of &quot;the bottom of the trunk,&quot; so to speak.  There are many more Berlin songs with which we are all familiar, but the three just mentioned are adequate examples.<br />Berlin's life went from that of a preteen runaway who survived by selling newspapers on a street corner, to that of a bar room entertainer, to a music hustler, to a song writer, to a musical show writer and theater owner, to, in his last years (from his 80's to his death at the age of 101), a virtual recluse.<br />Jablonski discusses all of these phases in great detail, and we come away feeling that we really know Berlin.<br />There was one thing in this biography that I felt could only be of interest to another song-writer.  This was when Jablonski would give long examples of the make-up of various chords in a given song.  Other than this detail, which one could skip if he or she wished, I felt that this was a superior biography.	2003-12-19

For this review, I'll discuss the changes and give a little additional information.<br />As a reminder, the movies included in this book are all there because movie-goers who were surveyed picked them.  Some 7,900 movie viewers who had seen over 900,000 films in the previous year did the picking.<br />Changes from last year include an addition of 256 new films, up from 1,000 to 1,256.  Also new is a section of the top rated new releases.  There are 40 films included in this category which range from drama to musical to action to documentary to . . . .  In my opinion, this list alone, along with comments by people (not critics) who have seen the films, makes the book worth while.<br />As in the previous edition, there is an alphabetical list of all the movies included as well as 55 lists (up from 50 last year) by various category.<br />In my opinion, this is a valuable resource when one is planning to rent a movie that has the kind of values that keeps people coming back.	2003-10-04

To me. Surrealism was to be seen exclusively in the art of Salvador Dali, Joan Miro, contemporary artist Michael Parkes, and others of their ilk.  <br />This book, which was originally published by City Lights Books of San Francisco as a double issue of the journal, \\"Cultural Correspondence,\\" was then reissued by them in 1980 in its present softcover book form.  It opened my eyes to the broader scope of Surrealism.<br />I have now discovered some of the many forms Surrealism can take.  For instance it can be found:<br />. . . . In the humor of O. Henry, he of the surprise ending<br />. . . . In George Herriman's cartoon, \\"Krazy Kat\\" featuring Krazy who loves the mouse, Ignatz, who, in turn, responds to everything, including expressions of love, by throwing a brick.<br />. . . . In the dancing of Isadora Duncan<br />. . . . In the comedy of the Marx Brothers<br />. . . . In old radio dramas such as \\"The Shadow\\" and \\"Mandrake the Magician\\"<br />. . . . In the lyrics of songs sung by Churchy La Femme in Walt Kelly's cartoon strip. \\"Pogo.\\"<br />. . . . In the screen comedy of Buster Keaton<br />. . . . And, in any of 3 or 4 dozen more examples<br />(I would also bet that if this book had been written a few years later, it would have included the comedy of Monty Python which, until I read this book, I never thought of as Surrealism.)<br />To see the thread that ties together these and countless other examples under the heading of Surrealism, one would have to spend some time reading this book.  The opening essay (which starts with a quote from Raymond Chandler, \\"It probably started in poetry, almost everything does,\\" and ends by stating that \\"Like popular culture, Surrealism allows us all to have our cake as well as to eat it.  Why settle for less?\\") gives the reader a good idea as to how some aspects of all forms of art and expression come together under the heading of Surrealism.	2003-09-24

US	50368037	R1CVSF5HYUPZQM	0061032425	325593509	The Family	Books	5	9	10	N	N	A FAMILY WITH A QUIRK OR TWO	According to Carol Gino's afterword, prior to Puzo's death, she and Puzo had discussed his unfinished manuscript of this book, and she, with his blessings, was able to fulfill his wishes and complete it.  In my opinion, her efforts were successful, as I detect no stylistic differences or breaks in the continuity of the book.  I feel that we, as readers, owe her our thanks for bringing his last dream to fruition.  <br />Before going into the body of the review, it should be noted that THE FAMILY is based on extensive research by Puzo, and the facts of the following are either historically accurate, or can be reasonably assumed from the facts available.<br />In THE FAMILY, Puzo has gotten away from his usual theme of 20th century Mafia families and, instead, has built this narrative around an ordinary Renaissance era family who resided in Rome.  Well, maybe not exactly ordinary.  They did have a quirk or two, and, after all, daddy was the Pope.  That's right, daddy was the Pope, so maybe they're not exactly an ordinary family after all.  Daddy, Pope Alexander VI, was Rodrigo Borgia, the father of the Borgia clan.  You know the Borgias, those playful youngsters; Cesare, Lucrezia, Juan, and Jofre.  In those far off days, the Catholic clergy couldn't marry, but a great many of them had mistresses and openly acknowledged their offspring.<br />Alexander was a truly kind-hearted man.  An example of this kind-heartedness was in the way he handled a politically necessary assassination of someone he truly liked.  He made sure that the assassination was carried out in the most humane, pain free way possible.  A true humanitarian!<br />Alexander might well have been called the \\"Education Pope.\\"  He strongly believed in education.  As an example, he made sure that an enemy or traitor was tortured and maimed before being allowed to die a slow and painful death.  The mutilated body was publicly displayed as an act of public education.  The lesson to be learned here was that you shouldn't make Pope Alexander angry.  A truly effective educational display by a believer in the power of education.<br />Alexander also loved his children and did everything in his power to assure their future happiness.  To show this concern, he would arrange marriages for them with appropriate mates who just happened to come from rich and powerful families.  That these marriages usually served to enhance his power base was merely a fortunate by-product.  <br />Out of love, he also did his best to insure the success of these marriages.  For instance, to make sure that his 13 year old daughter, Lucrezia, was properly prepared for her wedding night, he arranged for her older, and sexually experienced brother, Cesare, to \\"bed\\" her in advance of her marriage -- supervised by himself, or course.  What greater love and concern could a father have for his children?<br />And of his four children, it could be said that a more loving group couldn't be found.  First of all, there was Cesare who fell in love with his sister, Lucrezia, when he \\"bedded\\" her, and who could never bear the thought of her in some stranger's arms.  (This love was not unrequited.)  This feeling of brotherly love led to the violent death of Lucrezia's 2nd husband, Alphonso, who was the only man she ever loved more than her brother.  <br />Then there were the other two brothers, the cruel and arrogant Juan, and the rather simple Jofre.  Juan made a habit of sleeping with Jofre's wife and flaunting it.  Jofre was less than thrilled about this and, one day, Juan was mysteriously murdered.  The perpetrator was never found.  Ah, yes, fraternal love.<br />Did I mention that Lucretia's first child was Cesares?  The pregnancy couldn't have come at a worse time.  It seems that just at that time the Pope was having Lucrezia's first marriage annulled on the basis that the groom was impotent.  The supposed impotency made any rational excuse for the pregnancy a bit of a problem.  Things were worked out, and only oneinnocent man lost his life.<br />Just one more example of Alexander's love for his children.  When a political alliance changed, as they often did, Jofre's wife, whom Jofre had come to truly love, became a problem to the Pope, as she was now associated with a potential ex-alliance.  Alexander, without consulting Jofre, had Jofre's wife imprisoned in a dungeon where she was repeatedly raped by the guards, subsequently losing her sanity and eventually dying.  Needless to say, Jofre, once again,  was less than pleased about this new development.  Soon thereafter, Pope Alexander contracted a strange malaria-like illness and died.<br />As I stated in the opening, THE FAMILY is about an ordinary, loving Renaissance family with a quirk or two.	2003-09-14
US	50368037	R2C6BIBIQZVWDT	1581820070	636541307	Death Cruise: Crime Stories on the Open Seas	Books	3	1	1	N	N	UP WITH RUMPOLE --- DOWN WITH HONEYMOON	DEATH CRUISE, is made up of 22 short mystery stories that, as you would expect, center about cruises.  Each story is written by a different author, each using the cruise theme as a common thread to tie the stories together.  The styles and entertainment values vary widely, as do the periods in which they were written.  These vary from Agatha Christie's story written in 1936, to the bulk of the rest that were evidently written in 1999, the year this collection was copyrighted.<br />I wish that I could say that they were uniformly good, but I'm afraid that I can't because, at least in my opinion, they're not.  In fact, they're all over the place.<br />Let's start with Agatha Christie's &quot;Problem at Sea.&quot;  I don't think that it has held up very well with the passage of time.  I can't reveal what it is about the key premise of the solution of the murder that bothers me so much, as it would ruin the mystery for the reader, but, in light of what is fairly common knowledge now, it just doesn't work today.<br />Now for the bright side.  As always, I enjoyed John Mortimer's Rumpole and his wife, &quot;She Who Must Be Obeyed,&quot; who are on a cruise ship on their second honeymoon.  for fans of the &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot; series, it is amusing to even imagine Rumpole aboard a cruise ship where one must dress for dinner and if &quot;She Wo Must . . . &quot; has her way, go dancing in the evenings, drink fine liquers, hob-nob with fellow passengers, etc., etc.  This story, &quot;Rumpole at Sea,&quot;  combines most of the elements that go into a highly entertaining story.  As there should be because this is meant to be a mystery, there is a bit of a mystery.  There is, however, even more tongue-in-cheek British dry humor.  There are people you really care about, and a few that you don't.  All in all, it's hard not to be charmed by Mortimer's take on Rumpole, his wife, and a moderately unpleasant judge or two.<br />In &quot;Honeymoon Cruise,&quot; I couldn'tfind a single character I really cared about, so I just didn't care who was planning to kill whom.<br />But, on the positive side (again),we have &quot;Mutiny of the Bounty Hunter,&quot; which has people that grew on me, and by the end of the story, I really did care about what happened to them.  Even in a story this short, the author managed to give us real people who changed as the situation warranted it, not the unidimesnsional ones like those in &quot;Honeymoon Cruise.&quot;<br />In summary:  For me, DEATH CRUISE was really a mixed bag, with just enough entertainment value for me that I, like certain movie critics, can give it a &quot;reluctant tumbs up.&quot;	2003-09-09
US	50368037	RAU214M9FOGB9	0595249094	899013290	Elder Wisdom Circle Volume I: Letters, Guidance and Advice from America¿s Elders	Books	5	0	0	N	N	AN IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS COME	ELDER WISDOM CIRCLE is subtitled \\"Letters Guidance and Advice from America's Elders\\" and that subtitle exactly describes the book's contents. In my opinion, the concept of making a group of elders available to dispense the wisdom that comes from a lifetime's experience is an (old) idea whose time has come (again). If you're up on your history, you know that many cultures have revered and consulted their elders for just that reason. Doug Meckelson, founder of the Elder Wisdom Circle, seems to have realized that our society hasn't recognized this valuable asset of our seniors, and that the Internet is just the vehicle to provide such a service.<br />With this in mind he set up a website ... The letters and responses from the elders that are quoted in this volume make one believe that Mr. Meckelson has come up with a winner. By making a large number of seniors available to field questions, the Circle seems to almost always have someone available who has the experience to field almost any type of request for advice.<br />In addition, the letters and responses make for good reading. You can flip open the book to a page at random and you might find some suggestions that are useful to you or someone you know. You may also find yourself crying with one of the letter writers or joining the elder advice giver and tell another suggestion seeker to wise up and stop repeating negative patterns, or to even want to give your own hint on how to handle a maintenance or housing problem. These seniors do all of these and more.<br />According to the information on the back of the book: \\"(All) of the Elders are volunteer senior citizens who offer their lifelong learning and insight . . . to anyone with a question.\\" We are also informed that \\"there are misspellings and errors . . . all letters are exactly as written (in order) to retain original flavor and attitude . . . typos, abbreviations, and biting advice are included.\\" The service is free by the way.<br />The Elders have fielded questions on subjects as varied as: relationships with partners (cheating, abusive, or otherwise); in-law problems; teen age relationship/school/parent problems; work and related problems; and even requests for gardening and home maintenance advice, and my favorite, the request for the recipe for Shoofly Pie. (Which is provided in detail.)<br />Are the suggestions given always on the mark? Probably not, but enough of them are that I wish that I'd had this resource available at certain junctures in my life. Along this line, I noticed one or two letters that indicated that the suggestions they had received didn't exactly work for the writer, and he wondered if there might be any other advice available. The beauty of The Elder Wisdom Circle is that there are enough seniors with enough different sets of experience that there probably is someone else who might lend a little different viewpoint.<br />Elder Wisdom Circle does make the caveat that they will not give specific legal, tax, investment, or medical advice. Additionally, from the letters written, I noted that these seniors knew when a problem needed to be handled by a professional (clinical depression comes to mind) and recommended that the letter writer consult the appropriate professional.<br />To summarize: based on the advice and suggestions given by these elders, I wouldn't hesitate to seek their advice. Just reading the book gave me food for thought in a troubling area or two and, of course, I now know how to make Shoofly Pie.	2003-05-21

Seven years before this novel opens, Kathleen Darcy, a novelist famous for her one book, __Naked in the Ice__, disappeared under mysterious circumstances.  Although no body was ever found and the only evidence was her abandoned car, which yielded no clues, her disappearance was officially ruled to be a suicide.  Many of her friends, family, and fans question this conclusion and believe that she was either murdered or is still alive.<br />In the present, our protagonist Jacqueline (don't dare to call her Jackie!) Kirby, a successful novelist in her own right, wins a competition and is chosen to write a sequel to Ms. Darcy's novel.  Upset by this decision are some fans who believe that no sequel should ever be written, and at least two of the other authors who lost out to her in the competition.  These two rather unsavory characters are the aptly (self)named Brunhilde, and the bullying Jack Carter.  How Jacqueline \\"destroys\\" these two through public humiliation is almost a case study in \\"coolness.\\"<br />Jacqueline is a bit of an amateur detective whose instincts tell her that something is really amiss.  There are a lot of people who might have had motives to get rid of Kathleen Darcy, and maybe Jacqueline, too.<br />She therefore makes it her business to determine:<br />(A):  If Kathleen Darcy was murdered, or<br />(B):  She committed suicide, or<br />(C):  She is still alive, and <br />(D):  If murder, who is responsible, or<br />(E):  If she committed suicide, why, or<br />(F):  If she is still alive, where is she, and<br />(G):  Who murdered the owner of a local bookstore, a fanatical fan of Darcy, and why, and finally<br />(H):  Who is setting up \\"accidents\\" that threaten Jacqueline's life, and why do they mirror a series of so-called accidents that happened to Darcy shortly before her disappearance?<br />Whew!  That's a lot.  Now let's throw in a sleazy lawyer, Kathleen's most unappealing half-brother, a handsome chef, a handsome neighbor, a dishonest agent, a couple of Kathleen's sisters, the two losing authors already mentioned, and one or two others, all with seeming motives, and all with something to hide.<br />It's Jacqueline's self-assigned job to sort through all of these people and possibilities while protecting herself, and o find the solution to this \\"who-dunnit.\\"<br />How well does she do?  You'll have to make it your job to find out.	2003-05-13

Part of my reluctance to accept her conclusion has to do with the methodology used in building her &quot;proof.&quot;  She has a habit of introducing a possibility which somehow becomes a probability and then grows into an absolute.  She seems to believe that enough assumed possibilities constitute overwhelming evidence.  Hence, in her mind, &quot;CASE CLOSED.&quot;<br />The easiest way for me to illustrate this point is by opening the book to almost any page and let the author's words speak for themselves.<br />Page 65:  &quot;I am inclined to suspect that . . . .&quot; -- &quot;It may also be that he was physically different . . .&quot; -- &quot;The repeated use of the phrase would have been humiliating . . . &quot; <br />Page 72:  &quot;. . . . could not have possessed the coping skills . . .&quot;<br />Page 126:  &quot;If the killer had been standing . . . the killer must have held the knife in his right hand.&quot;<br />Page 162:  &quot;Many of the locations mentioned (in various Ripper letters) are places well known to Walter Sickert.&quot;<br />Page 166:  &quot;It would have been in character for him to . . . .&quot;<br />These are but a few of the great number of &quot;could haves&quot; and &quot;might haves&quot; and &quot;it is possible thats&quot; that fill PORTRAIT OF A KILLER . . . CASE CLOSED.&quot;  Assumptions abound.<br />It is well known to scientific investigators that if you start an experiment with a predetermined result in mind, you will probably find enough facts that fit and that your experiment will yield the desired result.  In Ms. Cornwell's case, I believe that, in the absence of hard facts, she was able to make enough assumptions to prove to herself that Walter Sickert really was Jack the Ripper.<br />I suppose that it is sometimes possible that a correct conclusion can be reached using bad methodology, but it is stretching the point to call it a proof.  Therefore, my conclusion:  CASE STILL OPEN.	2003-05-09

I am at a disadvantage because I can't compare this novel to his other writing, but that works as an advantage too.  I came to it without any preconceived notions based on his other writings.<br />What Leonard has done in TISHOMINGO BLUES is to set a gangster war in the center of a re-enactment of a Civil War battle and located the whole thing in a semi-rural, somewhat redneck, contemporary southern city; albeit, a city with gambling resorts.  To add spice to this setting, the main protagonist, Dennis Lenahan, is a carnival daredevil who dives into a tank of water from a height of 80 feet.  Further added to the mix is protagonist number two, blues lover and con man extraordinaire, Robert Taylor from Detroit.<br />There is no shortage of \\"evil-doers\\" in TISHOMINGO BLUES.  Even the good guys are bad guys, just more likeable.  They're our bad guys.  On the side of our good bad guys is Germano \\"Jerry\\" Mularoni, Detroit gangster.  On the other side, the first rank \\"baddies\\" are Arlin Novis, Juniper \\"Junebug\\" Owens, and Jim \\"Fish\\" Rein.  Non-aligned is John Rau, a member of the Criminal Investigation Bureau.  For color, we have Charlie, a one subject huckster, whose only subject of conversation is the two innings of Major League Baseball he once pitched.  There are also several other lesser characters includingling Tonto, an aptly named side-kick.  For love interest there are a few Southern Women with names like Verline and Loretta.  Put this whole bunch in Civil War Uniforms, both Union and Confederate, arm them, and give every one of them a reason to \\"do in\\" some or all of the others, and you have Leonard's plot in a nutshell.<br />There are no clean motives in this book.  There are no moral issues to be decided.  This said, Leonard does work up our sympathies for the two protagonists and before the sun sets on the battlefield (actually, even before it rises) we know for whom we'rerooting, whatever their motives.  That's one of the beauties of Leonard's writing, we know who our crooks are.<br />I found TISHOMINGO BLUES worth reading just to find out who does what to whom and how and when.	2003-05-08

My review is based on the original 1965 hardbound Bonanza Books edition. I mention this because, according to another reviewer, the more recently released softbound edition is both abridged and without some or all of the color comics that make this book such a joy.<br />Feiffer writes several pages of introduction that trace both the history of comics from newspapers to comic books and his own development from a child infatuated with everything about comics and super heroes to an adult writer/cartoonist.<br />I grew up following the adventures of many of the comic book super heroes he presents here. (Comic books were in their heyday and cost 10 cents.) By the time I was \\"into\\" comics, these super heroes were already well established and their super powers were taken for granted. In THE GREAT COMIC BOOK HEROES, Feiffer includes many of the comic book sequences that reveal how these super powers came to be. Here's some of what I learned from Feiffer:<br />Superman, as most of us do know, was sent to earth as a baby from a planet whose destruction was imminent. Inhabitants of that planet were all endowed with what, on earth, were super powers.<br />Batman didn't really have super powers. From the time when, as a child, he saw his parents killed by gangsters, he trained his body and mind to function as a crime fighting machine. <br />The Human Torch was, in fact, not human. He was created in a lab.<br />The Flash got his superhuman speed as a result of breathing gas fumes during a lab accident.<br />The Green Lantern got his powers from a green ring made from a magic green lantern.<br />Captain America got his super powers from an injection of a secret formula. He was supposed to be one of many superior beings created to fight \\"the Nazi menace,\\" but the scientist who invented the secret potion was killed by the Nazis before he could make any more. He took it's \\"recipe\\" to the grave with him. Thus, only one super hero, Captain America.<br />Plastic Man got his super powers from another lab accident in which he was exposed to a mysterious acid.<br />These are but a few of the Super Heroes, in their original comic book form, included in Feiffer's book. These, in particular, fill in missing backgrounds for me. <br />In these old comic books there was no confusion. There were \\"us good guys\\" and \\"those bad guys.\\" And guess what - the good guys always triumphed.	2003-04-30

Questions asked range from the serious to the ludicrous, but, almost without exception, they get answered.  Barbara Berliner, head of the New York Library's Telephone Reference Service since 1986 has compiled a list of some of the more interesting questions and answers from this period.  The result of this effort is THE BOOK OF ANSWERS.<br />THE BOOK OF ANSWERS is another of those books that can best be reviewed by citing some of the questions and answers that make up the text.  The librarians' ability to answer some of the questions asked makes one wonder how they are able to do so.<br />Here are just a few examples.<br />When asked about the most unlikely mating between dogs, Ms. Berliner and her staff came up with a mating between a male Dachshund and a female Great Dane.  The resulting litter contained 13 &quot;Great Dachshunds&quot; who were distinguished by their short legs and large heads.<br />For &quot;Lucy&quot; fans:  &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; ran for 6 seasons from 1951 to 1957.<br />A bit of baseball trivia:  The first fine in baseball was levied on June 19, 1846 in the amount of 6 cents for swearing at an umpire.<br />More trivia:  Of all the known animal species, only pigs and human beings get sunburned.<br />For convenience, the book is broken up into 27 categories which even include one of trick questions such as:  &quot;Where in the Bible does it say that cleanliness is next to godliness?&quot;  The short answer is &quot;Nowhere.&quot;<br />There are lots of questions and answers on serious subjects such as history, culture, language, fine arts, etc.  THE BOOK OF ANSWERS is ideal for flipping open to any page at random and finding some interesting bit of trivia.

I fully understand that ben Abuyah is a fairly obscure historical figure and that he has been fleshed out in this work of fiction loosely based on history.<br />I personally relate to the central philosophical question of AS A DRIVEN LEAF.  Since childhood, and still continuing today, I've always had a problem with the concept of \\"The Beginning\\" as in \\"In the Beginning God created. . . .\\"  My thinking is that there had to be a time when there was absolutely nothing, yet how can nothing become something, and what is \\"nothingness?\\"  Religionists say that God created something from nothing.  This leads me to ask: \\"Where did God come from?\\"  Scientists say that primordial gasses came together and that there was a \\"Big Bang.\\"  Again, I ask:  \\"Where did the primordial gasses come from?\\"  I can't conceive of nothingness but I can't comprehend there always having been something.  In any system of logic there doesn't seem to be an answer, and accepting it on faith doesn't work for me.<br />It is a form of this question that causes ben Abuyah to lose faith and begin his all consuming search for an answer based on pure logic.  Elisha ben Abuyah was a religious Jew who, early in life, had been exposed to Greek thought.  After some years as a Rabbi and leader of the Jewish community, he was re-exposed to Greek thought and to Euclidian Geometry.  Absolute faith no longer worked for him, and he replaced his faith with the belief that everything could be proven logically, this logic based on Euclidian Geometry and that faith was unnecessary.  He dedicated his life to studying and trying to prove this approach and was branded as guilty of heresy, and, as a result, lost his home, his place in the community, and his wife.<br />He finally became disillusioned when, as an old man, many years later, still in search of the final proofs, he came to understand that even in Euclidian Geometry, the first \\"given\\" had to be accepted by faith.  It's truth couldn't be proven.<br />What sadness when he realized that his whole lifetime's work  and its associated losses had been for naught.  He had come full circle, back to his starting point.<br />All of which leaves me just where I started too.  No logic explains \\"The Beginning.\\"  It has to be accepted on faith, and I can't.  I guess that if you can't accept it on faith, you're better off forgetting about the whole thing.  This, at least, was the final lesson learned by Elisha ben Abuyah.	2003-04-27

This is the non-survival of the most unfit.  By this she means those genetically coded to do something so stupid that they lose their lives as a consequence.<br />The book consists of a number of short anecdotes describing these often sensational, but occasionally mundane, deaths.  She identifies which anecdotes are validated, which are not, which are urban legends, and which are personal reports.  Whether you believe them or not, if you have a macabre sense of humor, you will probably enjoy them.<br />She has a category that she calls \\"Honorable Mention\\"  In this category, the protagonists live to regret their stupidity, as opposed to the true Darwin Award recipients, who are too dead to accept their awards in person.  (Yes, I know, there are no degrees of dead.  You either are or you aren't.  So sue me.)  I'm going to have some fun by talking about a few of these live folks.<br />There's a bank robber who hires a limo to take him to the bank he robs.  After the robbery he stops at a coffee shop to relax while awaiting the return of his limo.  Probably not the best escape plan.<br />A female drug user calls the police to complain that she's been cheated and given a packet of baking soda when she's paid her good hard cash for cocaine.  The police come, and they test her purchase which turns out to really be cocaine.

He shows, rather convincingly, that both parties cater to the wealthy and upper middle class, and in so doing tend to turn off the bulk of our eligible voters. It's in both parties' interest to keep the \\"unwashed masses\\" from voting. Otherwise their hand-picked candidates might not get elected, and they'd lose access to the big bucks. As an example of this he talks of the election of Jesse Ventura, an independent, in Minnesota. Minnesota's 60% turnout in that election was the highest in the nation. Ventura was a candidate who wasn't \\"packaged\\" by consultants, and who appealed to the kind of voters who usually don't vote when they can see no difference between the candidates of the two major parties. These candidates don't address the issues important to the average guy.<br />He tells how the media distorts election results by talking about dramatic shifts in one direction or another, when the only true shift is from voter to non-voter.<br />Example:<br />In 1994, the year of the Republicans' \\"Big Sweep,\\" 22% of eligible voters voted Republican and 19% voted for Democrats. In 1998, they reported a \\"Democratic Party Comeback\\" when the Republicans dropped to 18% of eligible voters voting for them, and the Democrats got 17%, also a drop. What this tells us is that, by disdaining both parties, the effective \\"None-of-the-above\\" vote increased from 58% in 1994 to 64% in 1998. Now that's a sweep.<br />Need another example? In 1998, George W. Bush was re-elected Governor of Texas by what the Media called a \\"breathtaking landslide.\\" Unmentioned by the media was the fact that only 26% of the eligible voters in Texas had even bothered to vote, the smallest turnout in the nation. Bush had managed to get only about 16% of the eligible voters to vote for him.<br />WEhen you compare this 26% turnout to the 60% turnout in the Minnesota election, only one conclusion seems reasonable. Candidates from both major parties have nothing to offer to the average voter. Even more frightening is the fact that the two major parties want it that way. Party candidates are beholden to their big donors, and the issues that are important to these big donors are not of interest to the average voter, so a great part of most campaigns is designed to keep us away from the polls.<br />Unfortunately for the country, but fortunately for these moneyed supporters of the politicians, this lack of interest on our part generally results in a choice between Tweedle-Dum and Tweedle-Dee.<br />A lot of people probable don't like this book although there are those who love it. I, for one, think that Hightower says a lot that needs to be said, but I'm afraid that it's not really being heard.	2003-04-19

I would really be surprised if any other political cartoonist had first made Richard Nixon's \\"Enemies List,\\" then, only four years later been named to the Richard M. Nixon Chair at Whittier College, Nixon's alma mater.  Conrad, himself, found this rather ironic.  <br />Conrad was chief editorial cartoonist for \\"The Los Angeles Times\\" from the early 60's to the early 90's.  In that period he created some of the most memorable political cartoons ever published.<br />Unabashedly liberal, he still found something about every President; Republican or Democrat, Liberal, Moderate or Conservative, that he deemed worth targeting.  This book contains about 200 examples of his work, and he never misses his mark.<br />There is an old expression that \\"one picture is worth a thousand words.\\"  This observation holds true here.  I'm going to try to describe a few of these 200 cartoons, but you'd have to see them for yourself to really appreciate them.<br />An example of his non-partisan president skewering is the cover cartoon which, drawn during Clinton's term, has caricatures of Presidents Nixon, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton with quotes from each as follows:<br />Nixon:  \\"I am not a crook.\\" --- Reagan:  \\"I don't recall any Iran-Contra connection.\\" --- Bush (Sr.):  \\"I was not in the loop.\\" --- and Clinton:  \\"I did not have sex with that woman.\\"<br />A few on non-presidential subjects:<br />On a drawing of two ragged children picking through a garbage pile behind a tenement building, \\"Speaking of child pornography . . . .\\"<br />A picture of an unbalanced scale shows a bullet on one side of the scale outweighing a huge pile of paper on the other side of the scale, labeled \\"one and a half million primary votes for Kennedy.\\"<br />On a drawing of J. Edgar Hoover at the gates to heaven being sent away by St. Peter: Hoover, with a file labeled \\"God\\" under his arm is saying, \\"You'd betterlook at what I've got on him.\\"<br />Conrad took on everyone and just about every issue, and, depending on who or what you loved or hated, you either loved or hated Conrad.

So why do I keep coming back to her books when there are so many other good mysteries out there begging to be read?  Well, let me try to figure it out.  There's Richard Jury of New Scotland Yard and his friend, and unofficial fellow mystery solver, Melrose Plant, the former Earl of Caverness (former because he has renounced the title just because he doesn't want it).  Together, they make a pretty good crime solving duo.  But then again, so do Holmes and Watson, or Batman and Robin, or even Nick andf Nora of \\"Thin Man\\" fame, but it's to Jury and Plant that I keep returning.  Why?  The truth is that Ms. Grimes has surrounded them with some of the most colorful characters in modern mystery fiction.<br />Before I discuss a few of my favorites, I'd better reveal a bit of the plot of THE FIVE BELLS AND BLADEBONE.  To start with, a piece of antique furniture in the town of Long Piddleton, home to Melrose Plant and many of the other \\"regulars,\\" is found to contain a dismembered body.  Elsewhere, the body of a murdered  London woman is discovered.  Although it is not evident, Richard Jury believes that there is some sort of connection between these seemingly unrelated murders.  He takes it upon himself to determine whether or not these murders are related to one another, and to find out who committed the murders.  Obviously, this is a simplified description of the plot.<br />Before going on to my real reasons for loving Martha Grimes' novels, I do have to tell you that Richard Jury and Melrose Plant are real, lively, and interesting characters who are worth reading about on their own.  They have distinct personalities, problems, etc., and it is rewarding to get to know them.<br />For starters, there's Jury's official aide, Detective Sergeant Wiggins.  Wiggins is a walking pharmacy.  He knows, as surely as he knows that sea air is poisonous, that he is going to fall seriously ill in the next minute.  Any air he breathes is fraught with murderous bacteria and virus.  He breaks out if it's dry and wheezes if it's damp.  He sneezes if it's spring and coughs if it's fall, but never fear, he has pills and potions, nostrums and salves, inhalants and something called \\"fishermen's friends\\" in one pocket or another.  He takes them all, too.  In spite of his hypochondria, he is an outstanding policeman with an analytic mind and an ability to take unimpeachable notes.<br />Then, in Long Piddleton, there's Melrose's friend, Marshall Trueblood, antique dealer and a frequent partner in Melrose's pranks.  Marshall dresses with a flair, in pinks and purples and mauves, in the finest silks and satins, and is rarely without a colorful scarf to set off his sartorial elegance.  These clothes are the products of the finest (read expensive) tailors and designers that London has to offer.  In this book, when an antique secretaire a abbant (desk to us commoners) he has purchased turns out to contain a dismembered body in it, his reaction is, \\"I bought the desk, not the body, send it back.\\"<br />It's difficult to describe Jury's Scotland Yard supervisor, Chief Superintendent Racer, without resorting to a description that combines the word pompous with a word that describes the south end of a mule who is facing north.  For reasons unknown, he has always had it in for Jury, but, in his heart of hearts, he knows that it is only Jury's amazing successes in solving difficult crimes that he, Racer, who is a total incompetent, has managed to keep his prestigious position.  There is also, Cyris the cat, the bane of Racer's existence.  Cyris is Racer's intellectual superior and lives only for the opportunity to torment and outwit Racer.  That Cyril survives whatever trap Racer sets for him is testament to their relative intellects.<br />As is always the case in Martha Grimes' mysteries, there are too many more wonderful characters to begin to even list them all in a review of this length, much less to really do them justice, but I would be remiss if I didn't discuss Melrose's Aunt Agatha.  She is everyone's nightmare in-law.  She is utterly without redeeming qualities.<br />And what sort of mischief is Aunt Agatha up to in this book?  Ah, she's at her best.  She is suing Jurvis the butcher for \\"serious injuries\\" to her leg, ankle, or foot (she occasionally forgets which) resulting from an accident caused by a plaster pig that has stood in front of Jurvis' butcher shop for many years.  The pig, she claims, somehow caused her to lose control of her car, an old junkheap, and to run up on the sidewalk, hitting both the pig and a parked bicycle.  This pig caused accident resulted in serious pain and suffering.  She can't exactly explain how the pig caused the accident, but there's no doubt that it was the pig's fault, just ask her, and Aunt Agatha is just the person to see to it that justice is served and that she will be adequately compensated for her injuries by way of a lawsuit.  Wonder how this case comes out when tried by a dozing local magistrate?  Well, I'm not going to spoil your fun by providing you with this information.  You'll just have to find out for yourself.<br />And, oh yeah, there's a murder to be solved too.  After all, this is a mystery novel.  You're just going to have to do some reading on your own to find out who dunnit.	2003-04-06

To wit:<br />He reminds us that a car is not a weapon of mass destruction. You don't have to use it as one when some guy in a dunce cap cuts you off in traffic.

Or, how about umpiring a little league game. You can make a difference at the community level (and have a good time doing it).<br />If you don't have one, get a basic education and use your newfound literacy to (among other things) read a variety of news sources. You'd be amazed how different things may seem if you get your information from sources more in-depth than the usual 30 second TV news clip. Also, you could use this basic education to learn more about the history of our world, and about the cultural diversity of the people in it.<br />Yep, all these suggestions and a whole lot more are in STUPID WHITE MEN . . . .

The majority of self-help books are a turn-off for me.  The pop gurus we see on television and in infomercials who, in 90 seconds or less, know all about you and can solve all your problems, aren't qualified to help you.  In contrast I believe that the suggestions given in DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF are so useful that I have purchased copies and given them as gifts to those nearest and dearest to me.<br />Dr. Carlson writes from experience garnered in over a decade as a practicing therapist.  From these experiences he has developed a set of suggestions on how to cope with the stresses and annoyances of life.  He doesn't try to analyze anyone, he just makes suggestions that one can use if they seem applicable.<br />There are so many useful strategies in the book that I can't begin to cover them all, so I will summarize a few that I found helpful.<br />&quot;Choose Your Battles Wisely&quot;:  In this section he advises us not to make a big deal out of things or persons with which we are at cross purposes.  Most confrontations are both an unnecessary waste of time and damaging to relationships, usually over meaningless issues.  Just let them go, he advises.<br />&quot;See The Innocence&quot;:  Here he tells us that when we are frustrated or irritated by something that someone says or does, we should look for the innocence behind the behavior.  If we do, we'll probably find out that the we, ourselves, are the cause of our upset.<br />&quot;Choose Being Kind Over Being Right&quot;:  Here he suggests that, in most cases, who is right and who is wrong just isn't important.  There's no need to always be right, so just ignore the opportunity to correct people.<br />One More:  &quot;Become A Less Aggressive Driver&quot;:  The benefits of this suggestion are practically self-explanatory, so I'll let you guess at them until you read the book.<br />These are just a small sampling of the 100 suggestions in the book, each of which can help to make a life more pleasant and less stressful.  Obviously, Dr. Carlson gives more detailed explanations, case studies, and various other enhancements to each of the hundred sections.  He doesn't pretend that these are easy principles to put into practice or that it doesn't take a lot of work and introspection to learn to feel better.  As he indicates, old habits are hard to break and a lot of backsliding is to be expected.  As my old grandmother said. &quot;Try it, you'll like it.&quot;  (Or at least you'll like the results.)	2003-04-03

As one works his way through these mystery novels, all the members of the ensemble take on lives of their own.  Another reviewer has stated that, in later novels, this being the first in the series, they become stereotypes.  It is my opinion that they merely stay in character.  This is not to say however that they don't show growth and appropriate change with time and circumstance.  They do.<br />One should know that the name of this book, THE MAN WITH A LOAD OF MISCHIEF, is the name of an English pub where part of the action takes place.  This approach is taken in all of the novels in this series. (18 to date covering over 20 years of writing)<br />Although any one of these novels can be read in any order, this one gives more character background than any of the others.  (I read it after having already read 16 others and it didn't hurt my comprehension of the others a bit.)  Each novel has an interesting and entertaining plot.  That said, what really distinguishes Ms Grimes' writing is the humor and local color she evokes through the antics, interrelationships, and subplots involving the various members of her cast of characters.  There are over a dozen of them and each is fully realized with  personalities, weaknesses and strengths, likes and dislikes, and friends and enemies.  <br />The plot here involves the murder of strangers visiting the  English town of Long Piddleton.  In order to solve the mystery of the murders, it is first necessary to determine whether the murders were the random work of some madman, or if they were somehow related in a way that is not apparent.  That is the gist of the plot.<br />The ensemble consists of 12 to 18 characters whose importance tends to vary from novel to novel.  In this, and most of the others, Detective Chief Inspector Richard Jury of NewScotland Yard, his assistant, the hypochondriacal Sergeant Wiggins, and his newfound friend in Long Piddleton, Melrose Plant, the former Lord Ardry are the key participants  (Melrose is the former Lord Ardry because he didn't want the title of Earl and so renounced it.)<br />There are a great number of players at the next tier and each is important in his own right.  Some provide a real touch of humor, and others contribute to the main plot, but all combine to make this book what it is.<br />I must digress here and give a short description of Melrose Plant's Aunt Agatha - Lady Ardry - Lady because she happened to marry Melrose's titled uncle.  She is an American and is enamored of the concept of being titled.  Picture, if you will, a rather rotund late middle-aged woman who wears a cape, pushing open a door with no regard as to who or what might be on the other side, wielding a silver cane, like a sword, shoving aside anyone who happens to be between her and her destination.  As often as not, her destination is a tray of cakes, tarts, and other sweets which she demands as her due at her nephew's home.  After eating them all, she complains because there are no more, and on her way out pilfers Melrose's late mother's diamond ring, or a precious jade carving, or some other valuable item.  Later she will wear the jewelry or display the stolen object in front of Melrose with no sense of shame.  How Melrose handles this with humor and a shrug of his shoulders is an example of Ms. Grimes tongue in cheek manner.<br />Another character we come to know and love is Cyril The Cat who loves to torment Jury's Superior (in rank only) and always outwits him.<br />There are more, lots more.<br />So if one likes mystery with a liberal sprinkling of humor THE MAN WITH A LOAD OF MISCHIEF might be just what the doctor ordered.	2003-04-02

Several of the previous reviewers of LABYRINTHS have done an excellent job of discussing its nature and general contents as well as addressing Borges, his background, and his philosophical bent.  Rather than going back over material previously covered, I'd like to address a few of the short stories, or as he refers to them, fictions.  I'll stick to these and leave the essays and parables to another reviewer.<br />A few of his fictions, such as &quot;The Shape of the Sword,&quot; are fairly straightforward narrative accounts.  &quot;The Shape of the Sword&quot; does have a bit of a twist at the end that makes it very worth reading, but it is not on this type of story that Borges built his reputation.  That reputation comes more from such fictions as &quot;The Lottery in Babylon,&quot; &quot;The Library of Babel,&quot; and &quot;The Sect of The Phoenix,&quot; among others.  I hope that a short discussion of these three will whet one's appetite to read Borges in his own words.<br />&quot;The Lottery In Babylon&quot;  is the story of the evolution of a simple lottery into an all encompassing game of life.  It leaves one with the philosophical question as to whether life is controlled by some master gamesmen or is all a matter of random chance.<br />&quot;The Library of Babel&quot; imagines a world composed of a library without physical or temporal end.  You cannot read this story and not wonder about the concept of infinity.  That concept is obviously one of physical, metaphysical, and philosophical import.  A thoroughly thought-provoking story.<br />&quot;The Sect of the Phoenix&quot; is a bit sneaky.  Borges discusses a sectarion group with a secret rite that has infused itself throughout our world.  This rite, though almost universally practiced, is rather hush-hush in polite society.  Borges never overtly reveals what this secret rite is, but somewhere along the line, the reader uncovers the mystery and will probably kick himself and say &quot;I should have seen that coming.&quot;<br />I can't imagine reading this book without becoming more aware of the mysteries around us.	2003-04-01

It was probably because of those novels that I expected so much from Ms. George's short stories.  I wonder if I might have liked these stories better had I approached them without these expectations.  I'm afraid that I'm not introspective enough to answer this largely rhetorical question.<br />I do think that the major problem is that her writing style is one that utilizes a leisurely approach to the development of the personalities of her creations, and what makes them tick.  The same can be said of her development of plot line.  The limitations of the short story format just don't allow the time for this sort of build-up, thus her short story characters tend to be one dimensional types rather than her usually fully developed real people.<br />The middle story in this five story book, \\"Good Fences Aren't Always Enough,\\" is the primary example of these one dimensional characters.  Even their neighborhood, Napier Lane, is unidimensional.  It seems to exist only to win the town's periodic \\"Perfect Neighborhood\\" designation.<br />As to its inhabitants:<br />Willow is the well intentioned wife and mother type.<br />Scott is the distracted husband type.<br />Leslie is the soap opera watching couch potato type.<br />Ava is the transplanted Southern Belle type.<br />Beau is the obedient henpecked husband type.<br />You get the picture - not a one of them have any other dimensions to their personalities. <br />In most of the rest of these stories, the plot is rather predictable, and, in the opening story, \\"Exposure,\\"  I sure couldn't figure out any motivation for the murder, even though the introduction referred to this very aspect of the story.<br />The story for which the book was named, \\"I, Richard,\\" was the book's saving grace.  The writing was much more like what I have come to expect from Ms. George.  Theprincipals did have personalities and motivations.  You felt like you actually knew each of them.  Even though the outcome was rather predictable, it made for good reading.  Since it was the last story in the book, I did come away from I, RICHARD  feeling somewhat satisfied.	2003-03-30

But then, it would have to be to cover so much material and to include so many beautiful illustrations.<br />Before I get into the &quot;meat&quot; of the book, I'd like to discuss the illustrations.  It is difficult to imagine the amount of study and research it must have taken to find these illustrations.  They range from thousand year old papyrus illustrations to frescoes to ancient pottery, to antique stone and jade carvings to statuary and on and on.  They come from a myriad of ancient cultures and sources.  If there were no text in MYTHOLOGY, it would be worth owning just for the art work.<br />But text there is!  The text is broken down by geographical area, and by culture within that area.  Also included, are maps where appropriate.  For instance, the locations of the labors of Herakles (Hercules to the Romans) which I will discuss further later.<br />From the standpoint of depth of detail, this is not a scholarly reference.  Rather, it is the work of good story tellers, for, after all, the ancient myths were good stories.  By this I mean that the book is aimed at the layman (like me), and wherever you open it at random, you will find a great tale of ancient gods, monsters, giants, heroes, and just plain humans.  These tales have come down through time, some predating the advent of writing.  <br />MYTHOLOGY opens with a general discussion of mythology, comparing myths with magic mirrors which reflect the hopes and fears of ancient civilizations, and often, those of our civilization, today.  Mythological tales, we are told, form the basis of much of the world's literature, philosophy and religion.<br />As I mentioned, MYTHOLOGY makes wonderful reading, last night I opened it randomly to the section on Herakles and spent a wonderful half an hour or so reading about Herakles and his labors, the lustiness of some gods, the pettiness of others, and the good and the deceitful sides of men.  All that in thirty minutes.<br />Pick a mythological character be he god or monster, hero or human, and the chances are good that you will find him here.	2003-03-29

The plot of SAINT PETERS WOLF varies significantly from the typical werewolf story.  (For the traditional, think of the movie with Lon Chaney, Jr.) In this novel, instead of becoming a werewolf by being bitten by one, one becomes a werewolf through a combination of predisposition and proximity to an ancient set of silver fangs.  Only a select few are so affected.  Other variances from the common tradition are the continuing metamorphoses through which Cadmun's werewolf goes, and finally it is a story of love.<br />With this oversimplification of the plot, I'm going to vary from the traditional review format by posing a series of questions that can only be answered by reading Cadnum's novel.<br />All of the following questions, except the last, are based on SAINT PETERS WOLF.<br />What is the meaning of the title?<br />How is it possible that a beast can be seen as both a threat and a victim?<br />What is lycanthropy, and is it actual, mythological, or a form of mental illness?<br />Is werewolf or vampire hunting the obsession of a madman, the hobby of an evil man, or the duty of a moral man, or perhaps, some strange combination of all of the above?<br />How does becoming a werewolf affect the human half of the werewolf?<br />Does the wolf half have human feelings?<br />After reading this novel, could you have empathy for a werewolf?<br />And the final question:  If someone told you that they were a werewolf in their human manifestation, could you believe them?<br />I would hope that these questions might stimulate your curiosity enough to make you want to read SAINT PETERS WOLF.	2003-03-28

This book made such an impression on me that I still carry images from it with me today, over 40 years later.<br />Since these particular impressions are so strong, I must have felt that they were key to Kazantzakis' message.  Therefore, what I remember and how I remember it follows.<br />First of all, I remember Jesus as a young man who already knew that God had a plan for him, and that God's plan involved a lot of suffering.  Jesus had other ideas, and was trying to anger God so that God would find someone more worthy to bear all that suffering.  In an early chapter, Jesus, in attempt to be found unworthy, was working for the Romans making crosses for crucifixions.  He figured that there was no way God would choose as his symbol on earth a cross maker.  As we kinow, God had other ideas.<br />Next is my memory of the disciples.  According to Kazantzakis, eleven of them were what we, today, would call wimps.  The twelfth, however, was cut out of a different cloth.  He was a big, strong, red-haired and red-bearded man of great emotional and physical strength.  When the time came for Jesus to be betrayed, he called Judas aside from the others and told him that he, Judas, was the only one of the twelve who had the strength of character to take the scorn and abuse that would be heaped upon him for his seeming act of betrayal.  Judas argued that he didn't want to betray Jesus to the Romans, but Jesus told him that it had to happen, and that only he, Judas, could be relied on to take the role of betrayer.  This, along with Jesus' cross making earlier in his life are certainly at odds with the Story as we know it, but they are part of Kazantzakis' approach which humanizes Jesus.<br />My last memory is of the Final Temptation which came in the form of a vision that came to Jesus after he had been nailed to the cross.  I won't describe the vision here.  It should be read in Kazantzakis' own words for maximum impact on the reader.<br />In outline form, Kazantzakis' book follows the Gospels but differs significantly in the details.  I know that many religious authorities feel that the book is blasphemous, but, for me, the humanization of Jesus and his suffering make his martyrdom much more meaningful.<br />For many of you who have read the novel more recently, it will probably be tempting to correct some of my details.  I can only say that the above is how I remember the novel, and that it is those memories which make it such a great novel to me.	2003-03-28

Phew, what an ongoing nightmare!<br />Bing, who progressed from book-store employee to talent agent to part-time festival manager, to full-time manager of the Met (Metropolitan Opera House, in New York), spent the last 23 years of his career as the manager of the Met.  Along the way, the founding of the still on-going Edinburgh festival was one of his major accomplishments.<br />There is no doubt that Bing, himself, had a monumental ego, but that ego along with his drive and desire to make a success of the Met, was absolutely necessary if he was to deal with the many temperamental artists that make up a big part of the Opera elite.<br />He found the Met in near shambles - a badly deteriorating building, a limited repertoire, scenery and sets badly in need of repair or replacement, severe scheduling problems, and inadequate funding to rectify these problems.  Under his guidance, many new productions were mounted with proper scenery, sets, lighting, etc., a lot of additional funds were raised, adequate rehearsal time became the rule of the day, and the Met finally got out of the old opera house and into the new Lincoln Center which had been designed with the needs of the opera foremost in the minds of the architects.<br />5000 NIGHTS introduces the readers to many of the leading lights of opera during Bing's tenure, and through anecdotes reveals which ones fit the classic stereotype of the \\"Prima Donna\\" (many did), and which of them bent over backwards to be co-operative.<br />In his closing chapter Bing states that \\"I found most singers hard working and reliable.\\"  He lets us know that he was appreciative of his opportunities and felt that he had a most gratifying career at the opera.most singers hard working and reliable.\\"  He lets us know that he was appreciative of his opportunities and felt that he had a most gratifying career at the opera.	2003-01-02

Hawkins of Columbia University's Oral History program.  Unfortunately, he died before he could edit these thousand or so pages into a cohesive manuscript.  The good news was that he had discussed his intentions with the editors of this book, and they feel that they have brought his intentions to fruition.<br />They not only used the aforementioned transcripts, but they also made use of the copious diaries that he had kept since his student days at Columbia University.  In addition to that, they had his scrapbooks and many articles he had written which came in handy where clarification was needed.<br />The resulting book is not just a biography of Bennett Cerf's life.  It is also a history of the publishing business, centering, of course around the company he had co-founded, Random House, and containing a number of anecdotes about writers, entertainers, politicians, editors, power-brokers, and just plain everyday people, and, in addition, it is a condensed history of the U.S. for the first three quarters of the twentieth century.  <br />Through the course of the book we are given insights into the characters and personalities of such diverse persona as Eugene O'Neill, Robert Sherwood, Ayn Rand, George Gershwin, Moss Hart, Irwin Shaw, Harry Truman, Douglas MacArthur and many, many more with whom Cerf had business and/or personal relations.  No matter how difficult the person was to deal with (and many of them were) he could usually find some redeeming features.  There were one or two exceptions to this, but I'll let you read the book to find out who and why.<br />Along the way, Cerf was instrumental in building the company, Random House, that he had co-founded and nursed through its infancy, from a single office with four or five people to a publicly owned organization, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and one with a book list that included a number of authors and titles that anyone would be proud to represent.  Many of the books Random House brought out were Pulitzer Prize winners, Book-of-the-Month Club selections, etc.  He was also responsible for bringing the Modern Library to its prominent current position in the book industry.  On the reverse side of the coin, he was also responsible for bringing out a few real stinkers.<br />Along with his business acumen, Cerf built up a reputation of honesty and integrity.  He was well liked by almost everyone who knew him and was respected for his compassion and sense of humor.<br />When he died, THE SATURDAY REVIEW OF LITERATURE carried an obituary that included the words I used for the title of this review.  AT RANDOM concludes with an excerpt from this obituary.	2002-12-31

I can't count the times I've heard people with no background in Yiddish use words like \\"mavin\\" (expert), or \\"shnuk\\" (a real pitiful character), or dozens of others.<br />Rosten's frequent approach is to take a word or expression, explain its pronunciation, define it as nearly as is possible, and give an anecdote or example of its use.  When the word lends itself to humor, Rosten usually opts for a humorous anecdote.<br />For an example, I've chosen the word \\"chutzpah.\\"  It is pronounced to rhyme with foot spa, with the ch rolled in your throat to give the German gutteral \\"kh\\" sound, not like the ch in \\"choo-choo.\\"  The nearest you can come to defining \\"chutzpah\\" in English is unmitigated gall or perhaps brazen effrontery.  An example of \\"chutzpah\\" is the man who, after killing his mother and father, asks the court for mercy because, after all, he IS an orphan.<br />There are hundreds of such examples in the book.  There are also many more serious examples of words that do not lend themselves to humor.<br />At the end of the book there are appendices which discuss Jewish Traditions, Ceremonies, Religious Writings, Names, and more.<br />Rosten has evidently done his research to come up with the many hundreds of entries in the book.  He has provided a valuable research document and a book that can be opened to almost any page and elicit a chuckle or two.	2002-12-31

Because one of our friends was a Marine Biologist at Wood's Hole Oceanographic Institute and worked with John Teal, one of the authors of this book, we were lucky enough to attend a Fourth of July Celebration at the Teal's farm.<br />John and Mildred had purchased a colonial era Cape Cod farmhouse and the hundred or so acres that surrounded it.  Other than hot and cold running water, electricity and natural gas, and a slightly modernized kitchen (i.e. the stove used gas rather than burning wood), the house looked much as it had when it had been built.<br />As might be expected, the Teal's Independence Day celebration was ecologically sound and reflected the era in which the farmhouse was built.  The children got rides on one of the more tame domesticated goats, the women competed in tossing a rolling pin for distance and accuracy, and the men tried out old fashioned farm implements.  The food was prepared from hand gathered and harvested local foods.  For instance we had mussel salad made from mussels that I had help gather the day before.  There were cranberries from one of the Cape's cranberry bogs, and quahogs and oysters dug up just long enough ago to let them naturally filter out the sand.<br />The point of all this is that the Teals believed in and acted on the ecological and preservationist principles that they espoused in their book.  In LIFE AND DEATH OF THE SALT MARSH, they do a wonderful job of discussing how a salt marsh is formed, how long it takes, and how ecologically fragile it is.  They make the point that man can, and does, destroy in a decade or less what it has taken nature centuries to build.  Since, as they point out, the salt marshes play an important part in nature's food chain and ultimately in the life cycles of many species, when we damage or destroy these natural habitats, the consequences can be disastrous.<br />If we all could live a little more like the Teals were living, our children and their children might still have some of nature's bounty left to enjoy in future years.<br />It is my opinion that this is one of those books that ought to be compulsory reading for every thinking human being.live a little more like the Teals were living, our children and their children might still have some of nature's bounty left to enjoy in future years.<br />It is my opinion that this is one of those books that ought to be compulsory reading for every thinking human being.	2001-02-17

Their reviewers called it witty and insightful and &quot;useful to the general reader, and especially to the historian and student of language.&quot;  To this I would add that it is also a great source of trivia to trip up one's spouse or drinking buddies.<br />I can't think of a better way to describe its contents than to give a few examples out of the 7,500 or so entries that I found interesting, or amusing, or both.<br />Being an American, I had never quite understood the difference between a solicitor and a barrister or exactly how these British attorneys related to their American counterparts.  Now I do.  A solicitor is a type of legal practitioner who does general legal work while a barrister is one who does trial work.<br />Now, for American Baseball fans:  Do you know why &quot;K&quot; is the symbol for a strikeout?  I didn't either, but now I do.  Way back in the dark ages of baseball, when a batter struck out, it was said that he had &quot;struck.&quot;  Letters were used for scoring then just as they are now, but the letter &quot;S&quot; was already being used for sacrifice, so they assigned &quot;K,&quot; the last letter of the word struck, to stand for &quot;a player who missed the ball in three swings.&quot;<br />Here's one for our British cousins:  &quot;'S - - t' said the Queen.&quot;  The following has never been proved but it makes a great story.  Mark Twain and his good friend, Rudyard Kipling, had a contest to see who could make up the bawdiest and most offensive story,  An effort of Kipling's which began with &quot;'S - - t!' said the Queen&quot; was brought to Queen Victoria's attention.  She was not amused.  This may explain why Kipling was never knighted and never became Poet Laureate.<br />There are at least two names in this encyclopedia for what I'm being in this review; &quot;Smart Aleck&quot; and &quot;Wiseacre.&quot;  I'm going to risk &quot;getting your dander up&quot; and be a real smart aleck by telling you that you'll have to find your own copy and look these up for yourselves if you want to know more about them.

Imagine putting together a committee whose purpose it is to write a book about the oceans around us, their history, and how our lives are affected by them.  We would probably need a geologist, a mythology expert, a historian, a marine biologist, a physicist, a Biblical Scholar and his counterpart, an expert on Darwin's theories, an astronomer, a marine engineer, a seer or two, and last but not least, an explorer.  Amazingly enough, Peter Freuchen is a sort of one man committee who fulfills all of these requirements and incorporates all of these viewpoints into his BOOK OF THE SEVEN SEAS.<br />Freuchen devotes chapters to a wide range of ocean related subjects such as the geological history of the earth from the time it was a flaming ball until it became the planet we inhabit today, then on to all aspects of the ocean ranging from currents to tides to to winds to the animals and plants that call the oceans home, ad infinitumn.  Other chapters address the history of seafaring from rafts and sailing ships to submarines, discussions about great voyages from the early explorers to the Kon Tiki, great sea battles, and mysteries, mythology and marvels of the sea.<br />One discussion that I found particularly interesting revolved around the idea of the &quot;seven seas.&quot;  In reality, in Freuchen's own words, &quot;there are at least seven times seven seas (or alternately) only one.&quot;  The term was first used by ancient mariners of the Mediterranean world who knew only seven large bodies of water which they thought were the seven seas of the world.  They also thought that the world was mostly land, between 85 and 90% in fact.<br />With the coming of the age of exploration, it was discovered that the ancients had made a rather serious error.  There was a lot more water than had been thought, and many new seas were discovered.  Because of these explorations and discoveries, the term &quot;seven seas&quot; was dropped and largely forgotten for several centuries.  Then,in 1896, along came Rudyard Kipling.  In looking for a title for one of his works, he rediscovered the term and incorporated it into his title.<br />In Freuchen's terms, &quot;(Kipling) was a great man, and a popular man, (so) the world had to make his words good.&quot;  To do this the geographers figured out a way to divide the ocean into seven parts.  Again, according to Freuchen, it isn't a very good way, but we can get along with it &quot;even if few of us can remember what the seven are.&quot;  <br />For information purposes, the ancient and modern lists follow:<br />Ancient:  Mediterranean, Red, China, West African, East African, Indian Ocean, and Persian Gulf.<br />Modern:  Arctic, Antarctic, North Atlantic, South Atlantic, North Pacific, South Pacific, and Indian.<br />To summarize, and again quoting Freuchen: &quot;The whole thing is a triumph of poetry over reality.&quot;<br />Freuchen's books have gone out of print and, in my estimation, that's a shame.  All are worth reading both for the learning experience and for pure enjoyment.	2001-02-09

First it addresses the kind of interest in language history and behaviour that we encounter daily (for instance: a young child's attempts to talk), and secondly, it attempts to make sense out of what we observe.  To address these concerns, the book consists of 11 main categories having topics such as &quot;Popular Ideas About Language,&quot; &quot;The Medium of Language: Writing and Reading,&quot; and &quot;&quot;The Languages Of The World.&quot;<br />These 11 categories are further broken down into 65 subsections on such subjects as &quot;Language and Thought,&quot; &quot;Investigating Children's Language,&quot; and &quot;Language And The Brain.&quot;<br />One of the beauties of this book is that it practices what it preaches.  In the section on Plain English, it emphasizes simplicity as the key to readability and it is written in just such a simple, readable manner.  In this regard, Crystal quotes the recommendations of the &quot;Plain English Advocates&quot; as follows:<br />&quot;Prefer the shorter word to the longer one.  Use simple  .  .  .  .  rather than fancy ones.&quot;<br />&quot;Write short sentences with an average of no more than 20 words.&quot;<br />&quot;Write short paragraphs with an average of about 75 words.&quot;<br />And very importantly, I think, &quot;Write with your ear.  .  .  .  .  Do not write anything you could not comfortably say.&quot;<br />There is much more like this.  Along these same lines he quotes George Orwell's six rules of what to do when instinct fails.  A couple of these rules also merit mention.<br />&quot;Never use a long word when a short word will do.&quot;  and &quot;If it is possible to cut a word out, cut it out.&quot;  And, again, more along these lines.<br />I think that these few rules and others like them are important to one of the main themes of the book which is effective communication.<br />There are segments of the book that, in my opinion, ought to be invaluable to the professional researcher as well as the casual reader.  For instance, there are sections that relate language to childhood development, contain discussions of language and other systems of communication, and discussions of language and social identity to name but a few.  Many are accompanied by charts, tables, illustrations, maps, etc. where they add breadth to the discussion.<br />To summarize, THE CAMBRIDGE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF LANGUAGE has something to offer to a wide range of readers, from the would-be writer, to the experienced writer who wishes to be more effective, to the researcher, to the intellectually curious.e invaluable to the professional researcher as well as the casual reader.

Mrs. Schiff's book can be just as helpful to our friends and relatives too.  It's important that they realize that we're not crazy either.  In fact, it should be compulsory reading for anyone who is in any way close to a parent who is trying to go on living after the loss of a child.<br />First, a litle personal background:  In 1980, my 17 year old son lost his life as the result of an automobile accident.  Like so many other recently bereaved parents, I wasn't sure that I wanted to go on living, and, until I found a group called &quot;Compassionate Friends&quot; that was made up of other recently bereaved parents who met to share memories and feelings, I didn't think that there was anyone &quot;out there&quot; who had any idea of what I felt.  In addition, as Mrs. Schiff states in this book, married couples who are each going through their own feelings of grief, guilt, anger, etc., are absolutely incapable of meeting the needs of their respective spouses, something that an &quot;outsider&quot; cannot fathom, but will be more aware of after reading this book.<br />To a bereaved parent, almost anything that someone who doesn't share their experience has to offer in the way of sympathy or advice can be thought of as being thoughtless and/or ignorant.  Reading this book is one way for a friend to get some idea of how to relate to a bereaved parent and what to say, or more importantly, what not to say.<br />Mrs Schiff mentions that you shouldn't say anything like &quot;I understand what you're going through.&quot;  You don't understand what we're going through unless you've been there yourself.  On one occasion someone said to me, &quot;I understand what you're going through, my dog died recently.&quot;  Can you imagine how I felt hearing that?  The other one that I will never forget was the man who said, &quot;You don't know how lucky you are, I have a retarded child and have to deal with that every day.&quot;  I didn't consider myself lucky at all, and why someone else's tragedy was supposed to make me feel better, I'll never understand.  Don't even think of comparing tragedies.<br />The point of this is that both of these people were well meaning but what they said, out of ignorance, should have been left unsaid.  A reading of THE BEREAVED PARENT will let you know that the best thing to say to a bereaved parent is &quot;I know that I'll never understand what you're going through, but I want you to know that I'm always here for you with an easr to listen and a shoulder to cry on.&quot;  Then, really be there for them.<br />To summarize; THE BEREAVED PARENT, in addition to being a virtual life saver to one who has lost a child, can also be read as a sort of guide book on how to provide support and love to your friends who are coping with the loss of life's most precious gift, their child.	2001-01-25

In my opinion, his THE STORY OF PHILOSOPHY accomplishes exactly that.  <br />From the standpoint of being an overview, it covers trends in philosophy and the individuals who influenced these trends from the early Greek philosophers to the present day.<br />From the standpoint of accessibility, he uses language, thoughts, and anecdotes that are easily understandable without ever stooping to condescension.<br />Yes, the book is lavishly illustrated and could be an attractive &quot;coffee table&quot; book, but it is much more than just that.  I found it both interesting and informative.  Like so many good books of this nature, it gives enough information to create interest in following up on any of a number of subjects discussed in whatever depth one might choose.  It also contains a good list of more detailed books on many of the great thinkers down through history who have been discussed here, coupled with the suggestion that one ought not to just read about them, but should also read their actual works.<br />In Magee's discussion of Saint Auguztine, he (Magee) shows Saint Augustine to be a real person with pain and desires just like the rest of us.  He mentions that when Augustine was young and not yet reconciled to Christianity that he used to pray to God to &quot;make me chaste, but not yet.&quot;  How much more human could a future Saint be?  I mention this because I found it fascinating and because it is indicative of many other special insights one can get from this book.<br />I found his section on Bertrand Russell to be particularly interesting.  When Russell gives two slightly different versions of the same statement and discusses how one version goes against known fact and is therefore false, but the second version is without any factual basis and therefore cannot be proved to be either true or false he provides much food for thought.<br />There arediscussions of everyone from Socrates to Kant; from French Philosophy to German Philosophy; from the early Greek world to the world of the 20th century; and more, much more.  <br />There is also a handy glossary to explain the special nuances of many terms.  All in all, I think that Magee has done an admirable job of writing a very readable book that meets his goal of accessibility coupled with a fairly comprehensive overview of his subject.	2001-01-19

Between about 1958 and 1963, I was lucky enough to drive the western portion of Route 66 twice in each direction.  (From about Tulsa, Oklahoma to its terminus at Santa Monica, California)  Today's Interstate Highways have cut the driving time down considerably, but, as this book shows so well, that which has been sacrificed for speed is an experience of place and people that is irreplaceable.<br />Even today, when I think of Arizona, I can't picture it without the series of Jack Rabbit signs along westbound Route 66.  As I remember them, the first inkling of things to come was a small sign along the roadside with a small, black, long-eared jack rabbit on it.  No information, just a lonely little jack rabbit.  After another 10 miles or so, there was another one, only a little bigger, then another and another, each a little bigger than the previous one.  Eventually, you came upon the sign shown on page 186; still just a jack rabbit only much larger, and now with the words, &quot;Next Exit.&quot;  No other words, just &quot;Next Exit.&quot;  Finally, one last sign as shown on page 187, this one billboard size, a huge black jack rabbit and the words &quot;HERE IT IS.&quot;  Then &quot;IT&quot; came into sight:  The Jack Rabbit Trading Post in Joseph City, AZ, as shown on pages 186-187.  A huge Jack Rabbit stood on the roof.  After having your curiosity piqued for a hundred miles or so, how could you not stop?  This is the kind of memory that is brought back by the illustrations on almost every page of the book.<br />With a State by State rundown, and with multiple pictures, reproductions of old postcards, photographs of both ruins of and still standing motels, gas stations, and cafes, and interviews with some of the &quot;characters&quot; who populated and had businesses on the Mother Road, this book would seem to have something for anyone who ever drove along old Route 66, or who would like to know what traveling was like in the days when there really was something newand different around every curve in the road.	2001-01-18

I saw a Russian made film of  Dostoevsky's &quot;The Idiot.&quot;  A stark, realistic, black and white film, it made a lasting impression on me.  <br />In later years I could never find a reference to this film anywhere.  I almost began to think that I had imagined seeing it.  Finally, along came my copy of FILM DIRECTORS:  A COMPLETE GUIDE.  There it was!  I really had seen it.  It was directed by Ivan Pyriev, a Soviet director who had died in 1968.  <br />My point here is that this guide to directors is much more than one might guess, having complete sections on subjects such as &quot;Notable Directors of the Past,&quot; and being cross referencing by film titles.<br />It is of course, useful for more mundane purposes such as finding the names of agents, or winning your bet on film trivia.<br />I find that I refer to it frequently for a number of reasons, but will always be particularly thankful for its sections of information on out of date and out of the mainstream subjects.	2001-01-14

Anytime superlatives are used to describe someone or something in this manner there is room for debate.  I do not have the academic credentials to enter into any debate concerning the degree of Jeffers' greatness, but I do weigh in with those who highly praise his work.  Though born in the Eastern portion of the United States, Jeffers settled in Carmel, California early in his life and spent his last 58 years there.  The rugged California coast coupled with the Pacific Ocean provided much of the imagery in his poetry.  Included here are several of these poems such as &quot;Morro Bay,&quot; &quot;The Purse Seine,&quot; and &quot;The Place for No Story&quot; to name a few.<br />The poems chosen for inclusion in SELECTED POEMS are spread across the last 40 years of his life, 1924 thru 1962, the last few published posthumously.  In addition to covering the greater portion of his mature productive years, the poems selected offer a sampling of most of his styles and themes.<br />One of his earlier narrative poems, &quot;Roan Stallion,&quot; has been chosen for inclusion.  This powerful poem invokes myth-ritual, theology, racial memory, shock for shock's sake, and blood-lust to name but a few of its themes and undercurrents.  &quot;Roan Stallion&quot; is meant to be read, not analyzed, but it, along with the &quot;Tamara&quot; narratives have been analyzed to death by multiple critics and students of Freud.  Because his themes in poems such as this were uncomfortable for many people, his popularity as a poet has suffered.<br />In addition, and again unfortunately for his popularity, Jeffers was an outspoken isolationist during WW II, and wrote a number of poems with themes critical of U.S. involvement in the war.  Among those included here are &quot;We Are Those People,&quot; &quot;So Many Blood Lakes,&quot; and &quot;Calm and Full the Ocean.&quot;<br />Tor House, Jeffers' home in Carmel, and the adjacent Hawk Tower which he built with his own hands for his wife, Una, are open to the public on a limited basis.  On two weekend afternoons most weeks, there are two or three docent led tours open to about ten people per tour (reservations a necessity), This book is carried on the tour by the docent, and at appropriate places in the house, garden, or tower, the tour stops and poems are read aloud by volunteers.<br />My favorite poem for reading on the tour is &quot;The Bed By the Window.&quot;<br />It starts with:<br />.  .  .  .  .&quot;I chose the bed downstairs by the window for a good<br />.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .death bed<br />.  .  .  .  .When we built the house; it is ready waiting.&quot;<br />And concludes with:<br />.  .  .  .  .&quot;When the patient daemon behind the screen of sea-rock<br />.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .and sky<br />.  .  .  .  .Thumps with his staff and calls thrice 'Come Jeffers'&quot;<br />Jeffers wrote this poem in 1932, kept the bed empty and waiting, and, some 30 years later, in 1962, when he knew he was dying, had himself moved into it and did die there.  Reading that poem aloud, while standing beside the bed and looking out the window toward the sea was a one of a kind emotional experience for me.  I'm glad that I volunteered to read this poem aloud on that occasion.  SELECTED POEMS has had special meaning for me ever since.	2001-01-11

SOULS ON FIRE didn't make an instant Hasidic expert out of me, but it did give me a feeling for the history and traditions of a movement that, in the years of the holocaust, played a major, if indirect, part in the preservation of Eastern European Jewry and its culture.  (It made reference to the dancing, too.)<br />The modern Hasidic movement seems to have started with the Baal Shem Tov (1700 - 1760).  (Baal Shem Tov translates as Master of the Name.)  Passed from the Baal Shhem Tov through succeeding generations of disciples, some of whom also became Masters, or Rebbes, in their own generations, the movement survived, and even thrived in a much less than friendly environment.  Eventually it had spread to three geographical areas; the Ukraine, White Russia, and Poland.  In each area there were individual Rebbes who taught their own brand of Hasidism and who had their own fervent followers.<br />Since Wiesel's approach to his subject is to let the various tales and parables of the Rebbes speak for themselves, it's my intention, in this review, to do the same but on a very limited scale.  A few comments follow:<br />Baal Shem Tov:  &quot;Whoever loves God exclusively  .  .  .  . excluding man, reduces his love and his God to an abstraction.&quot;<br />Wiesel's Grandfather, a Hasid, but not a Rebbe:  &quot;To induce others to believe is easier than to believe.&quot;<br />Menachim-Mendl of Kotsk:  &quot;In Hell one prays better than in Paradise.&quot;<br />Rebbe Bunham of the School of Pshiskhe:  &quot;I think that I could reform any sinner - except a liar .  .  .  .  and the worst liar is one who lies to himself.&quot;<br />One complete tale which evidently is meant for God's ears and which reflects on man's seemingly futile wait for the Messiah:<br />This is also from Rebbe Bunham:  A king, wanting to punish his son, sends him into exile in a distant land.  The prince, suffering from hunger and cold, waits to be recalled.  As years go by, he loses the very strength needed to wait for the royal pardon.  Finally, many years later, the king sends an emissary with full powers to grant the prince every desire and wish.  In response, the prince asks for a piece of bread and a warm coat, nothing else.  He has forgotten that he is a prince and that he could return to his father's kingdom.<br />Some of the more pessimistic Rebbes seemed to feel that God had to be reminded of his responsibilities to man, and so reminded him through their tales and parables.<br />Wiesel tells us that Hasidism was born in and survived eras of fear, hunger, and persecution.  He hints, through references to his own incarceration, along with most Eastern European Jews, in the Nazi Concentration Camps, that Hasidism, bred in times of anguish, had the strength to survive the hardest test of all, the murder of most of its adherents.<br />Very little in SOULS ON FIRE can be read in a literal sense.  To get the full impact of the book it is necessary to suspend reliance on reality in favor of imagination and perhaps a touch of compassion.	2001-01-11

In Spain, there is a more restrictive meaning.  'Aficianado' only means one who is passionate about the bulls.  In fact, the concept is so restrictive that some bull fighters are considered to be just 'commercial' bull fighters and are not passionate enough about their chosen profession to be considered 'aficionados.'  This is so according to Hemingway.<br />In the broader sense of the word, Hemingway, in this book, reveals himself (as Jake Barnes) to be an aficionado when it comes to boxing, drinking, fishing, and bull-fighting.<br />I had a problem with one aspect of &quot;The Sun Also Rises.&quot;  I found Hemingway's excessive use of negative ethnic stereotyping to be troublesome.  For starters, he has created in Robert Cohn, a character who is emotionally unstable and thoroughly unlikeable because of his 'Jewishness.'  Following are a few examples of this portrayal:<br />In reference to Cohn  (observations of Barnes and his friends):<br />&quot;He had a hard, Jewish streak.&quot;<br />Brett's gone off with (other) men, but they weren't ever Jews.&quot;<br />&quot;That Cohn gets to me.  He's got that Jewish superiority.&quot;<br />&quot;That kike.&quot;<br />In reference to Jews in general:  &quot;She gets five hundred quid a year and pays three hundred and fifty of it in interest to the Jews.  They're not really Jews.  We just call them Jews.  They're Scotsmen, I believe.&quot;<br />There are numerous other instances, but these already cited should suffice as examples of Hemingway's Jewish stereotyping.  <br />He went after other groups too.  To wit:<br />On Blacks:  &quot;The n  ,  ,  ,  ,  drummer waved at Brett.  He was all lips and teeth.&quot;<br />On gays:  &quot;I wanted to swing on one  .  .  .  .  to shatter that superior, simpering composure.&quot;<br />He didn't quit there either.  He went after the Frenchand, on numerous occasions, showed his disdain for all casual tourists.<br />There is so much of this sort of prejudicial stereotyping throughout the book that it was ruined for me.  It's too bad, because his bull-fight descriptions obviously came from an aficionado but were, for me, tainted by his attitudes.	2000-12-17

This is a book about losers.  By losers, I mean the men who came in second best in the political arena where winner takes all;  specifically in the race to become President of the United States.  <br />The book, published in 1945, consists of twenty biographical sketches of losers of presidential races from Henry Clay in 1824 to Thomas E. Dewey in 1944.  THEY ALSO RAN, as well as giving biographical data on each of its subjects, includes a history of the times in which each of them lived, ran, and lost; and social, economic, and political backgrounds of each era.  Using these twenty men as focal points, Stone gives us a fairly comprehensive picture of the political history of the United States from 1824 to 1944.<br />Now, I am going to do something that I think is rare, if not unique, in these book reviews.  I'm going to devote most of the rest of this review to the dust jacket.  Across the dust jacket there is a graph consisting of 21 lines ranging from minus ten (-10) to plus ten (+10).  In case you're wondering, the twenty-first line is the zero (0) line in the middle.  Stone refers to this zero line as &quot;the danger line,&quot; i.e. a candidate in the negative zone may well do more harm than good if he wins the presidency.  The graph rates the winners and losers of twelve elections according to Stone's estimation of each man's &quot;ability and worth to the nation at the time of the election.&quot;  The candidates are represented by silhouettes having their heads at one of the lines.  For clarity and consistency, the winners are in white and the losers in outline form.  It is interesting to note that the lower ranked in some years are sometimes ranked higher than either the winner or loser in other years.<br />Some interesting evaluations:<br />Highest ranked winner in any year:  Abraham Lincoln (+10) in 1860.  His opponent, Stephen A. Douglas had a (+1) ranking.<br />Lowest ranked winner in any year was Warren Harding (-9) in 1920.  His opponent who lost theelection was James M. Cox who was rated at (+3).<br />Most evenly rated election:  1928 when winner, Herbert Hoover and loser, Alfred E. Smith were both rated (+5).<br />In three elections the winner fell into Stone's &quot;danger zone.&quot;  These were:  1856, James Buchanan (-1); 1872, Ulysses S. Grant (-5); and 1920, Warren Harding (-9).<br />Of the twelve elections on the graph, according to Stone's ratings, the man more valuable to the country at the time the election was held won six times and lost five times.  In the twelfth election the candidates were considered evenly qualified.<br />It is my opinion that Stone's research was good, and that he was as politically unbiased as was humanly possible.  I would find it interesting if someone with Stone's credentials and even-handedness were to write a sequel covering the elections from 1948 through the court decided election of year 2000.  Any takers?	2000-12-16

Why, then, can't I express these attitudes as well as he does?  Could he possibly be more talented than I?  Could he be more creative?  Nah!  Must be dumb luck.  He quit his day job and became a successful cartoonist.  If I had quit my day job with a similar intent, I probably could have been his poster boy for &quot;How to tell everyone off, go into business for yourself, be completely fulfilled, and starve to death.&quot;<br />I did recognize several of my past bosses and their management approaches in WORK IS HELL, particularly on the cover of the magazine, &quot;Lonely Tyrant.&quot;  Some of its featured articles were:<br />&quot;Humiliating Some Poor Sap In Front Of Everyone Else&quot;<br />&quot;The Three Part Plan For Squelching New Ideas&quot;<br />.  .  .  .  1.

There is a section devoted to the 81 types of employees with the 81st slot reserved for the readers own photo.  I'm sure that most of us will recognize some of our co-workers here, and, if we are even a little honest, a description or two of ourselves.<br />WORK IS HELL is also an instruction manual with segments devoted to creative ways to kill time, how to play the game of work, and how (not) to get a raise.<br />I do have to mention one more instructive chapter:  &quot;How To Get Along With All The Jerks At Your Crummy Job.&quot;<br />If you are not a member of the idle rich nor were you born into royalty, there's probably some little tidbit hidden away in this book for you.	2000-12-15

She tells us that, with the exception of the first chapter, REPORT TO GRECO was still in first draft form when Kazantzakis died, and that &quot;If he had been able to rewrite this Report, he would have changed it.  Exactly how, we cannot know.&quot;  It is a &quot;mixture of fact and fiction.&quot;  And, finally that, if he had lived long enough, &quot;he would have poured it  .  .  .  .  into the mold of reality.&quot;<br />She also states that his times (i.e. the sequence of events as he relates them) are wrong.  In fact, if you read a bibliography of his works, you will find that both &quot;Zorba&quot; and &quot;The Odyssey, a Modern Sequel.&quot; were written much earlier in his life than one would infer from what Kazantzakis has written in this book.<br />Whatever it is, REPORT TO GRECO is not an autobiography.  If this is the case, what then, is it?  I believe it to be the story of one man's lifelong search for his own raison d'etre.  For many years he didn't seem to be consciously aware of his own motivation.<br />His quest led him first to the Christian Saints and Christ; then to his teacher, the French philosopher Henri Bergson; then to the philosophic teachings of Nietzsche; then to Buddha and Lenin; and finally to the Odysseus within himself.  Dominating all of these was his own Cretan soul.  Each time he moved from one philosophy or set of teachings to the next, he thought that the new one was the answer he sought, and that he was discarding the old.  What he finally came to realize was that, all along, he had been building, not rejecting.  The culmination of this search came with his sequel to Homer's &quot;Odyssey.&quot;<br />Kazantzakis was a child of Crete, and it was to Crete that he always returned for rejuvenation.  It was also the spirit of Crete and his Cretan forebears that infused all his works.  According to him, his works went through a sort of internal germination period, and only when THEY were ready to be written could he begin to write.  This was particularly so when he wrote &quot;Zorba, the Greek.&quot;  Zorba was a real person who, in the three months that Kazantzakis and Zorba spent together, had taught Kazantzakis &quot;how to live and how to love life.&quot;  Kazantzakis says that after he heard that Zorba had died,it took months before the story of Zorba allowed itself to be written,<br />I would love to have been able to experience Crete with the eyes and soul of Kazantzakis.  Whin I visited the site of Knossos, I saw archeological ruins and reconstructions, mosaics and frescoes, pots and statuary, ancient cart roads, what may or may not have been part of the famous labyrinth, and the religiously symbolic double axe.  I'm afraid, though, that I only saw them as objects.  When Kazantzakis would visit Knossos, which he frequently did throughout his life, he would feel its mystery.  As an example, in a fresco of a flying fish (dolphin?), he sensed both the evolutionary urge inherent in lower animal orders, and a possible source of man's desire to always ascend.  Had I read REPORT TO GRECO before my visit to Crete, perhaps I, too, might have been prepared to see and feel that which lay beneath the surface.  Maybe, maybe not.  Perhaps one must be a true son of Crete to share this sort of experience with Kazantzakis.<br />From the many conclusions that Kazantzakis was able to draw from his life-long search, I'd like to quote just a few.<br />On death:  &quot;It is true that we cannot conquer death.  We can however conquer the fear of death.&quot;<br />On freedom:  &quot;.  .  .  .  The man who either hopes for heaven or fears hell cannot be free.&quot;<br />On love:  &quot;Perfect love exists between two people only when each addresses the other with 'O myself'&quot;<br />As one might expect, Kazantzakis expands on these themes which are but a few among many.  There is much food for thought in this book.<br />It is also my opinion that Kazantzakis never lost his way, although many critics seem to think he did.  Somewhere in the book he states that he took a path similar to that of a boat tacking into the wind, tacking first to the right, then to the left, but always gaining on his objective.<br />He must have done something right in the way he lived his life, because his only true regret when he knew that he was dying was that he didn't have time to complete his planned projects.  &quot;Oh for a little time, just enough to let me finish my work.  Afterwards let Charon come.&quot;  A little time to finish and then on to his maker.<br />I feel that neither I, nor any reviewer for that matter can do REPORT TO GRECO justice.  It would take the soul of a born and bred Cretan to begin to do so.  There's so much here to be read, contemplated, and absorbed that only a cover to cover reading can begin to reveal its magic.es which are but a few among many.

He used to place a lot of emphasis on less commercial, more out of the way places.  By this, I don't mean that he ignored the more popular commercial sites.  He just gave us a lot of options.<br />In La Mancha, he directed us up a dirt road above the town of Almonacid de Toledo, where, on a Sunday morning, we had the deserted ruins of a castle to ourselves.  No ticket booths, no souvenir stands, no guides, no one else, just my wife and me.  Just the two of us with the morning sun, the dew still on the grass, and the ruins to explore to our hearts' content.<br />Later the same morning, on a windy hill, high above another La Mancha town, Consuegra, waiting for us were seven giant windmills -- the largest I've ever seen.  It was easy to see how they inspired Cervantes to write his famous windmill tilting scene.  We kept waiting for Don Quixote and Sancho Panza to appear, but they must have been taking Sunday off.<br />Another place that we never would have found without Rick's help was the Caves at Pileta.  Pileta is not an easy place to find, and is not mentioned in most other guide books.  &quot;22 Days&quot; is the exception.  The caves are at the end of a dead end road about 30 or 40 miles north of Ronda.  When you reach the end of the road, the hard part of the trip is still ahead.  Into the side of a steep, rocky cliff, several hundred stone steps have been carved.  You must climb these to reach the caves.  &quot;22 Days&quot; had warned us about the difficulty of the climb, so it didn't take us by surprise.  The caves are very rustic.  They are owned by the grandson of the farmer who discovered them and it is he who leads four or five tours a day into the depths of the mountain.  No commercial tour this.  The tours are restricted to about twelve people.  To start, three Coleman type lanterns are pumped up and lit.  The guide carries one, someone inthe middle carries one, and the last person in line carries one.  They are the only light anywhere in the caves.  A crude path has been cut into the ground, and in several places you find yourself walking in shallow water.  After about a half mile walk, you are treated to several areas of paleolithic era cave paintings, and you come across a few piles of bones and pottery shards.  We are told that the bones are both human and animal, and that some of them are over five thousand years old.<br />I think that the real appeal of Rick Steve's older books was in helping the more adventurous tourist find places like these.  It was also our experience that at least some of the inexpensive lodgings that he recommended were real finds.  I think particularly of one in Granada just a few hundred yards below the entrance to the Alhambra.  It was very inexpensive, clean, and was owned by the second or third generation of the same family.  The woman who, with the help of her son, owned and operated it, (Matilda was her name) was both personable and helpful.  When I was leaving Granada and heading south, she told me about a secondary road through the mountains that turned out to be one of the scenic highlights of our trip.<br />Other than some of his recommendations on where to eat, which were hit and miss, Steves' recommendations and descriptions were right on the money.  For all the wonderful things we saw only because of his write ups, I can forgive him a poor meal or two.	2000-12-07

In addition, he is both a poet and a travel writer.  THE GREEK ISLANDS, though not one of his better known works, is much more than an ordinary travel guide.  As he says, &quot;the modern tourist is already well provided for in that respect.&quot;  How, then, would you describe this book?<br />For starters, it is an island by island discussion of the physical characteristics, history, mythological importance, and peculiarities of each island.  Durrell blends these together so well that, by the end of each section, you feel that you know what makes each island unique and that traveling there would be more like returning to the home of an old friend than making a first visit.  He also relates those experiences that might be a warning to skip one or two of the smaller islands.  In this respect he tells of an island so small that the only place to sleep was on the floor of a small chapel.  This, in itself, was no reason to stay away, but the bed bug bites and fleas were.  Luckily this sort of experience was the exception, not the norm.<br />During an extensive period before World War II, Durrell was an employee of the British Foreign Service and lived and traveled in the Greek Islands for several years.  After the war, he spent several more years in a similar position for the Allies.  He got to know the native inhabitants much more intimately than most foreigners ever do.  He lived in some of their homes, hiked and camped in their less populous areas, and absorbed the ambience of many of the islands.  During that period he kept extensive diaries.  In preparing this book, these diaries along with contacts with many old friends still on the scene provided the basic information for the book.<br />There are two books that I wish that I had read before my visits to the Greek Islands in the early and mid '80's.  This is one and Kazantzakis' REPORT TO GRECO isthe other.  Each provided its own outlook, and together they give an unbeatable overview.  Most of us see ruins, particularly on islands such as Delos, the legendary birthplace of Apollo, drink, dance, and shop on islands such as Mykonos, eat the food and drink ouzo and retsina wherever we go, but we don't go out of or way to meet the &quot;before the tourist came&quot; natives.  Durrell talks of going to out of the way islands and villages where one finds a room by finding the mayor who, in turn, introduces you to someone who takes you into their home as if you were a friend of the family.  To do this, you have to be more of a risk taker than most of us are.  I'm not sure that I fit that mold by the time I was there in the '80's, but I'd like to think that I might have.  I certainly did when I was younger and living in the Philippines.  Then, I (foolishly?) knew no fear, and even slept, one night in a carabao pen.  (A carabao is a domesticated water buffalo.)  Any port in a storm when you're young and adventurous.<br />To summarize, Durrell presents a picture of the Islands that integrates a place, a people, an ancient history, a mythology replete with warring gods and goddesses, and a modern history, including wars and rebellions, and freedom and slavery,  into an experience worth reading about, and worth seeking out.  If I'd read THE GREEK ISLANDS before my trips, I would have been more on the lookout for that world.  I think that it's still there for those of us who really seek it out.	2000-12-06

Lo, these many years later I haven't shared even one.  They're too funny.  I can't give them up.  To see them, my friends have to come to my house and take a pledge that they won't steal one while I'm not looking.

Traditionally, it is critiqued on a stand alone basis as a satire written by a misanthrope.  If taken within his overall body of work, however, it can still be perceived as a satire, but one written by a man with a deep concern for mankind.<br />Parts I and II take a look at the foolish side of Englishmen, their religion, their politics, and their government.  Parts III and IV satirize humanity on a much broader scale.<br />In Part I, we find Lemuel Gulliver shipwrecked on the Island of Lilliput where the average inhabitant is about six inches tall.  The Lilliputians are actually small in both body and mind.  English politics and religion are here taken to task by descriptions of the doctrinal differences between those who wear high heels and those who wear low heels and by the dispute between those who break their eggs at the large end and those who prefer the small end.  Like England, through much of history, the Lilliputians are constantly at war with their traditional enemies from across the chanel.<br />In Part II, Gulliver is again stranded, this time in Brobdingnag, where the size proportions are just the opposite as in Lilliput.  Here, Gulliver is tiny in comparison to the inhabitants.  Here, too, Swift takes England and, for that matter, most of mankind, to task for being petty and contentious.  After Gulliver has described European manners, customs, and behaviour to the king, the king observes that, &quot;I cannot but conclude (that) the bulk of your natives (are) the most pernicious race of odious vermin  .  .  .  . to crawl on the face of the earth.&quot;<br />Part III takes on the world of scientists, philosophers, and all of their ilk.  On the flying Island of Laputa, the Continent of Lagado, and the Islands of Sorcerors and Immortals, Gulliver meets wise men who spend their lives in speculation but are incapable of dealing with the simplest practical problem, professors who spend their lives attempting to extract sunlight from cucumbers, and immortals who reveal history to be nothing more than a series of deceptions.<br />Finally, in Part IV, he finds himself in the country of the Houyhnhnms, who are horses with the power to reason.  These reasoning horses lead clean and simple lives in contrast to the beastlike humans, known as Yahoos, who are filthy, brutal, and uncouth.  In the Yahoos, Gulliver recognizes the human race, and, after finally returning home, he can never again be comfortable in the company of other humans.<br />Read by itself, GULLIVER'S TRAVELS is a satire on the foibles, weaknesses, and petty corruptions of the human species in general, and Englishmen in specific, as written by a rather embittered misanthrope.  That is a correct reading, but not the only one.  Read in the context of many of Swift's other works, particularly his many political pamphlets, I think that a case can be made that GULLIVER'S TRAVELS is a satirically inventive work written by a man who really cares about the future of humankind, and, using Gulliver as his example, that it is never too late to see the light.<br />As an aside, Gulliver's visit to Lilliput has, through the years, enchanted countless numbers of children.  It is in this section that we get a peek at Swift's humorous side.	2000-11-28

A number of reviewers on these pages seem upset because they cannot find one connecting theme that ties these stories and vignettes together.  I can only suggest that you develop the habit of reading the entire book, cover to cover.  If you did, you'd notice that Hemingway thanks SEVERAL magazines for permission to REPRINT some of the stories.  Of course there's no overall theme. He wrote the stories at different times, for different audiences, and gave them the appropriate slant for the periodical he hoped would publish them.  This is an anthology of his early works, each of which was meant to stand on its own.  Even the Nick Adams stories can be read on a stand alone basis.<br />Some of the stories do, in fact, reflect his love of outdoor sports such as fishing, camping, hiking, skiing, etc. In these, along with his bull-fighting vignettes, you can certainly see the beginnings of the Hemingway style of terse, to the point writing which accounts for much of his later fame.  Reading his A MOVEABLE FEAST, in which he discusses the early years of his career, might further clarify things for you.	2000-11-18

A preface, which was written after the play was already a hit, but was meant by Shaw to be a part of the reader's experience, and is necessary to the understanding of Shaw's main theme.<br />2.  A five act play, meant to be performed, and which is annotated in such a manner so as to facilitate deletion, on the stage, of portions only possible in a film version.<br />3.  What Shaw refers to as a sequel, written in prose, and outlining Liza and Freddy's life after their marriage which takes place after the end of Act V.<br />In the preface, Shaw first emphasizes the importance of reading his prose sequel.  He then devotes the bulk of the preface to a discussion of the difficulties of learning to speak English, because its written alphabet so inadequately reflects the sound of the spoken word.  He makes it very clear that he believes that the English Alphabet should be replaced by a 42 letter phonetic alphabet.  He states that, &quot;The English have no respect for their language, and will not teach their children to speak it.&quot;  He also states that Henry Higgins, the speech therapist, is at least partially modeled on Henry Sweet, a leading phonetician of the period.<br />The central portion of PYGMALION is the five act play to which most of us have been exposed in one form or another;  The original play, the screen play with the altered &quot;happy ending,&quot; or the musical version, &quot;My Fair Lady.&quot;  By now, I would guess that we all are very familiar with the plot in which Professor Henry Higgins teaches the uneducated flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, proper language and manners, and, for an evening, passes her off as royalty.<br />In the all important sequel, Shaw makes it very clear that language alone, is not enough to make the transition from street person to high society.  After a long struggle, Eliza and Freddy enter the world of tradesmen and, with Colonel Pickering's backing, open a flower shop in the arcade of a railway station.  Because neither Eliza nor Freddy have any concept of how to handle money (Eliza can't count or make change), the shop nearly fails.  Colonel Pickering subsidizes them for several years, helping them to get a modest practical education, and eventually the shop does become self supporting.  In this section, Shaw also explains why Liza picked the weaker Freddy over the stronger, but domineering Higgins.  For a fuller explanation, one should read the sequel which, as I mentioned above, is included in the book.<br />Shaw makes it very clear that, while proper language is a necessity for success in this world, it alone is not enough.  There is something to be said for proper upbringing, education, and exposure to culture.<br />A number of reviewers on these pages have seen PYGMALION as some sort of skewering of the British Upper Classes.  Some have seized on Shaw's political leanings to support these views.  There is merit in these observations, but I prefer to take Shaw at face value and accept his statement that his lifelong belief that language is everything and that it IS language that strongly influences the world's opinion of each of is his main reason for writing PYGMALION.  He even went so far as to attempt, in his will, to set up a foundation for the purpose of getting the English speaking world to accept an alternate phonetic alphabet and short-hand.<br />I would probably be remiss if I ended this review without a reference to the Pygmalion of Ovid's &quot;Metamorphosis.&quot;  Pygmalion was a king of Cyprus and a sculptor.  He sculpted a statue of a beautiful woman with which he fell in love.  In answer to his prayers to Aphrodite, the statue was brought to life as Galatea, and Pygmalion married her.  Shaw needed to look no further for a model plot.  PYGMALION should be read in its entirety, preface, play, and prose sequel.  By so doing, one can both enjoy the play, and better understand Shaw'smotivation in writing PYGMALION.	2000-11-17

First of all it is, as my title suggests, Papa Hemingway, near the end of his life, reminiscing about himself at the beginning of his writing career.  Next, it is a commentary on a group of young American expatriates who came to be known as &quot;the lost generation.&quot;  Finally, though perhaps unintentionally, it is a physical guide for those of us who would like to explore the Paris of the 1920's.<br />I have no way of knowing whether or not the young Hemingway was ever as naive as he is painted by the older Hemingway.  In scene after scene, Hemingway takes the most outlandish utterances at face value.  As an example refer to his luncheon conversation with Ford Madux Ford. I won't ruin your fun by giving you the details.  Along these same questionable lines, he describes his first wife, Hadley, as being a rather mild creature who follows his lead in everything without ever expressing a contrary opinion or desire.  Fact, or tricks of an older man's memory?  Who knows?<br />Regarding &quot;the lost generation,&quot; we are treated to an anecdote wherein Gertrude Stein's mechanic first coins the phrase.  We are also introduced to the likes of Ezra Pound, James Joyce, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Sylvia Beach, owner of Shakespeare and Company book store and publisher of Joyce's &quot;Ulysses,&quot; and, of course, Gertrude Stein and her companion who remains nameless in this book.  In the early years, Hemingway liked Stein and Hadley detested her nameless companion whose function was to &quot;talk to the wives.&quot;<br />Now to my favorite part; A MOVEABLE FEAST as a guide to Paris as it was, and mostly, still is.  On my last trip to Paris, I carried a copy of A MOVEABLE FEAST with me, and, with it, spent a couple of enjoyable afternoons on the trail of Hemingway, Stein, Pound, et al.<br />Since the book opens with the Hemingways living on the Rue Mouffetard, it was the beginning of my &quot;lost generation tour of discovery.&quot;  Rue Mouffetard is still there, not too far from the Latin Quarter and the River Seine.  It isn't much changed from Hemingway's day with the possible exception of a modern underground bowling alley.  One still sees meat display cases featuring pig snouts and ears, and skinned rabbits.<br />Many of the rest of the locations mentioned in the book are in Montparnasse within just a few minutes of each other, and again on the left bank, only a few minutes walk from the Seine.  I started with Hemingway's apartment.  The sawmill beneath it is gone, but the building still stands there.  A few hundred yards up the street, Ezra Pound's house still stands.  We were able to locate Gertrude Stein's apartment from the address given in the book, and sat in her courtyard waiting for Hemingway, Joyce, and perhaps Picasso to drop by.<br />Again, only a few hundred yards from Hemingway's apartment, we visited the Closerie des Lilas, Hemingway's &quot;home cafe,&quot; where he could be found many mornings doing his writing.  The only change is in the prices.  These are only a few of Hemingway's haunts that can be located by using A MOVEABLE FEAST as your guide book.<br />In summary, for me, A MOVEABLE FEAST is a mini guide to my favorite city and a mini history of my favorite era in that city.	2000-11-14

Philosophically and theologically, they give the reader a lot to think about, albeit thoughts flavored with Schultz's brand of humor.<br />Schultz gives us an example of unshakeable faith in Linus and his belief that &quot;The Great Pumpkin&quot; will rise up from the most sincere pumpkin patch on Halloween Eve, bearing presents for all the good boys and girls.  Linus always rationalizes away &quot;The Great Pumpkin's&quot; non appearances, and the next Halloween finds him back in his pumplin patch, ready and waiting, one more time.<br />Sally Brown represents the commercial aspect of Christmas in a strip where, after Linus expounds on the true meaning of Christmas, she responds with, &quot;If I don't get everything I want for Christmas this year, I'm gonna gross out.&quot;<br />Then there's Snoopy, the canine philosopher.  When asked by Linus if he (Snoopy) is bothered by the fact that the Bible doesn't speak very well of dogs, Snoopy replies, in a thought balloon, that, yes, it bothers him but &quot;I just turn the other muzzle.&quot;<br />And, of course, there's always Good Old Trusting Charlie Brown.  In another strip where Lucy tricks Charlie Brown into attempting to kick the football one more time, she lures him by reciting the entire &quot;To everything there is a season.&quot;  Just as she pulls the ball away, and, as usual, Charlie Brown ends up flat on his back, she adds a new ending, &quot;And a time to pull away the football.&quot;<br />These are but a few examples of Schultz's gentle humor turned toward philosophy and theology and how they affect the &quot;Peanuts&quot; gang.	2000-11-13

I had always thought that this must refer to the manor in which some rich or powerful personage resided.  No way!  It really means a brothel.  That's a good one not to misuse.<br />Here's another from the French language:  How many of us know that &quot;bel air&quot; means poise, grace, or good deportment?<br />Any of us who have ever followed a court case have probably heard the Latin expression &quot;in camera.&quot;  That literally translates to &quot;in a room,&quot; but really means &quot;proceedings conducted in secret.&quot;  <br />Now for one from the Italian.  We have often heard that someone is a dilettante and most of us probably have some vague sense of what the word means, but how many of us could accurately define dilettante if asked?  I'd hazard a guess that the honest answer would be &quot;very few.&quot;  A dilettante is an amateur, particularly an amateur lover of the arts, but there is a subtler nuance to the word.  It also means that this amateur is one who approaches the subject with little or no serious study, and may well pretend to have more knowledge than he actually has.<br />This is just the surface.  LE MOT JUSTE defines and discusses such disparate words and phrases as &quot;Kung Fu,&quot; &quot;Pandora's Box,&quot; &quot;Nabob.&quot; &quot;Kismet, Kimono, and Kibitzer,&quot; to name but a few.  It also emphasises the nuances that often give the words and phrases their fuller meaning.<br />It's a good book for any literate person's book shelf.	2000-11-09

A person in a position of some power is contemplating a series of actions that will, most probably, cause damage to the careers and/or financial stability of several people either in his employ or in some other way dependant on him.  To those so affected, these actions seem ruthless, and, in fact, are ruthless, but taken by this future murder victim because he feels that they make good business sense.<br />These planned actions seem to provide plausible motives for his murder, therefore several of his associates or underlings do have motives for his murder.  In addition, most of these people seem to have had the opportunity.<br />During the course of the murder investigation there are other murders which may or may not be related to the original murder.  (Want to guess if they are?)<br />The one variation from this theme from the two previous P. D. James mysteries I have reviewed, DEVICES AND DESIRES and A CERTAIN JUSTICE, is that this murder victim is male instead of female.<br />That's the formula, here are the specifics:<br />Our victim, Gerard Etienne, began making significant changes shortly after taking control of Peverell Press, an old and distinguished London Publisher that had fallen upon hard times.  He planned to drop less profitable authors, to do away with some positions, and to sell the Venetian style building that had always symbolized all that Peverell Press had stood for.  These plans gave any number of people reason to wish him dead and, sure enough, he did turn up dead, murdered in what was supposed to look like a suicide.  Oh, did I mention that there had been a suicide at Peverell Press only a few weeks before Etienne's murder?  No?  Well there was, and in the same room where Etienne's body was found.  Aha, the plot thickens!<br />Because of Etienne's status in London society, Adam Dalgliesh and his team of investigative specialistsare called in to investigate the murder.<br />The bulk of the balance of the book is dedicated to the investigation and to the activities of various suspects and future victims of the murderer, as well as dealing with the personal devils inhabiting the minds and lives of Dalgliesh and his two key investigators, Kate Miskin and Daniel Aron.<br />Lady James writes in a leisurely but engaging manner, never rushing things but letting her scenes unfold at their own pace.  This aspect of her writing seems to bother some reviewers who prefer less description and more action.  I feel that it is exactly this aspect of her writing that sets her apart from the run-of-the-mill mystery writer.  She may utilize a lot of descriptive prose, but she does it so well!	2000-11-08

It seemed to say that there was something wrong with accepting one's limitations and living within them.<br />It would seem that in CELEBRATE THE SUN, Kavanaugh is saying that it's really okay to be yourself and that you are loveable for what you are, not for what you accomplish. This book takes the stigma off of not flying higher, faster, and further than your fellows. You are still loveable and a success as a human being (or pelican, as the case may be.)	2000-10-26

The sum of all his knowledge comes from what he sees on his television set and what he has learned tending his garden.  He doesn't read.  He doesn't write.  He really doesn't know that there is a world outside of his garden.<br />When the old man dies, Chance is thrown into a world about which he knows nothing.  His one advantage coming into that world is that he has the old man's hand-me-down suits which are impeccably tailored and are old enough to have come back into style.<br />By chance, Chance is injured by a chauffeur driven limousine belonging to a very rich and influential man.  (Thank goodness for the suit he is wearing!  Through no fault of his own, he looks rich and successful.)  He gives his name as Chance, the gardner and it is misunderstood as Chauncey Gardiner.  His vast experience in things worldly, gained from viewing television, tells him that if someone tells him that is his name then that is his name.<br />Whenever Chance, now Chauncey, enters into a conversation, he speaks of what he knows, the garden.  Within a very short time, his replies, such as, &quot;For everything there is a season,&quot; in response to a question about the future economic climate, are taken to be the astute observations of a brilliant man.<br />These meaningless utterances, coupled with his total lack of a background, make him into a media idol and, seemingly, the ideal candidate for Vice President of the United States.  After all, if he has no background, there's nothing in it for the opposition to attack, and his garden variety, visionary, comments don't have enough substance to be contradicted.<br />As a commentary on the media culture that existed when Kosinski wrote BEING THERE, and which still exists today, I don't think this book can be beat.  Further, as areflection on the ability of the &quot;unwashed masses&quot; to distinguish between hype and substance, it's rather frightening.<br />The book begins with the ambiguity of Chance's origins and ends in an ambiguous scene that leaves Chance's future open to interpretation.  I think that this is the only intellectually honest ending possible for BEING THERE.  I recommend BEING THERE for Kosinski's commentary on our media driven society and because of the inferred questions it asks us about ourselves.	2000-10-26

One, James Wickwire, is a senior vice president of a bank.  As such, he believes that one of his primary responsibilities is to keep &quot;his widows&quot; from being victimized by purveyors of various get rich schemes which are designed to make the purveyor, not the widow, rich.  These stories, circa 1930, present banking services as much more personal than they are in today's era of computers and ATM machines.  In all the Wickwire stories, his widows are a rather naive lot who seem perfectly ready to risk their inheritances on whatever scam comes along.  While Wickwire is watching out for his widows, someone or other invariably gets himself or herself murdered.  Wickwire, shrewd old banker that he is, always seems to deduce the identity of the killer well before the plodding, but well meaning, police have any idea of the identity of the perpetrator.<br />Another of Eberhart's amateur sleuth is a murder mystery writer named Susan Dare.  She appears in two or three of these stories.  I don't think I would want to invite her to my country manor for the weekend because, when Susan's a guest, someone invariably gets murdered.  But never fear, she, like Wickwire, always figures out the identity of the murderer, and usually before the weekend is over.<br />Ms. Eberhart writes in a rather genteel manner as typified by her description of banker Wickwire's thoughts when admiring an attractive woman.  &quot;Eloise was almost beautiful, with creamy, magnolia smooth skin, soft red mouth, and a rather luxuriant figure.&quot;  That's it.  That's all there is.  It's interesting to note just how much can be conveyed in a subtly understated manner.  Mignon Eberhart is good at it,<br />There are other stories and other amateur crime solvers in the book.  All are &quot;just everyday folks&quot; going about their business while solving a murder or two.  The book is dated, no computers, no DNA testing, and no high speed chases, justgood analytic minds.  I think that it's a better book for its reliance on the human mind as opposed to high-tech analytic methoods.	2000-10-22

In 1993, when CULTURE OR TRASH was published, James Gardner was the art critic for &quot;The National Review.&quot;  Early in the book, he describes a three week art extravaganza which was being held in a very upscale (read expensive) San Francisco Art Gallery.  When each guest arrived, he or she was met by a uniformed waiter and offered a cup of coffee to drink while browsing in the gallery.  The coffee was served in a simple white cup and cream was poured from a similarly simple white cream pitcher.  What most of the guests didn't know, and never were to know, was that they were a part of the art, a performance piece entitled &quot;Garcon.&quot;  That was it, three weeks of the &quot;artist&quot; pouring about three hundred cups of coffee.  Because the cream pitcher had been used in an &quot;artistic performance,&quot; and because it had been touched by a &quot;famous&quot; avante-garde artist, it became a &quot;relic.&quot;  It was labeled, encased in glass, and was last seen on the secondary market bearing a price tag of $24,000.  It's rather frightening to realize that we live in an age in which people will pay that much money for a dime store cream pitcher as long as it comes with assurances that it has been touched by a name artist.<br />That's the premise.  Are we dealing with culture or art?  Along the path to his conclusions, Gardner gives several good, succinct definitions of various 20th century art and architectural trends such as &quot;Modernism&quot; and &quot;Postmodernism.&quot;<br />Modernism:  Most Modernists never set out to be something called a Modernist.  They just wanted to make art in their own way, and then, one bright shiny day, someone told them they were Modernists.<br />Postmodernism:  In contrast, it is critically important to a Postmodernist that he be so identified.  He defines himself by what he is not.  First and foremost, he is not a Modernist.  He is in fact an Anti-modernist.  As long as a work of art rejects Modernism, it is Postmodernism.  A sculpture of plastic vomit:  They weren't doing that 15 years ago, so it's Postmodernism.  Three basketballs floating in a water filled aquarium:  They weren't doing that 15 years ago, either, so it also qualifies.<br />Although Postmodernism is at the core of his discussion, he includes discussions of most of the other 20th century schools such as Minimalism, Contemporary Art, etc.<br />What is revealing, according to Gardner, is that there are so many artists producing this stuff, so many agents representing them, so many galleries and museums showing this &quot;art,&quot; and, most surprisingly of all, so many people willing to shell out very large sums of money to own and display it.<br />As part of his answer to the question that is contained in the title, Gardner states:  &quot;Postmodernism is .  .  .  .  the reduction to absurdity of this artistic rebelliousness  .  .  .  .  rebelliousness pursued for its own sake.&quot;<br />He concludes by stating his belief that there will be a cultural regeneration, and that he hopes that it will come sooner, rather than later.  I, for one, share that hope.	2000-10-21

You don't know just where they stand until late in the book.<br />The plot is really two plots that mesh neatly at several points.<br />Plot A involves a gang of poachers of exotic animals who harvest various animal organs to sell in the Oriental marketplace as aphrodisiacs and curatives.  One young man who fits neatly into plot B (described next), is murdered when he accidentally comes across a poacher from plot A harvesting organs from an illegally killed animal.<br />Plot B is the more complex of the two.  It traces its beginnings to a murder that took place over 50 years ago.  The murder victim from out of the past was a Hispanic landowner and the young man killed by the poacher is a present generation relative of this landowner.  Somehow this old death and a feud between two brothers, dating back to the same time frame, are related.<br />Now, let's talk about good guys, bad guys, and question marks.<br />Good guys:  Our first good guy is Kevin Kerney, a former Santa Fe Detective who has been retired because of crippling wounds received on his last Santa Fe case.  He is now working as a part time employee of the Forest Service and has been dispatched to investigate reports of an illegally killed bear.  On this investigation, he teams up with our second good guy, Jim Stiles, a young New Mexico Game and Fish Officer.  During this investigation, they find the body of the young man murdered by the poacher.  In the ensuing investigation of the murder thay team up with the third good guy.  (Can you call a woman a good guy?)  She is Karen Cox, an Assistant District Attorney who is also the daughter of Edgar Cox, one of the feuding brothers.<br />Now let's take a look at the bad guys:  First there's Eugene Cox, the other feuding brother,paralyzed from the waist down, he's one really nasty bad guy.  All of the poachers are bad guys who are willing to murder at any time.  Then there are the members of a particularly violent paramilitary militia group who consider all federal agents, Forestry Service Department Personnel, and all environmentalists to be fair game.  They don't mind killing either.<br />Now for the guys in the grey area.  For starters we have Sheriff Omar Gatewood who is either incredibly stupid, or incredibly evil, or both.  Now we have Karen's father, Edgar Cox, the other feuding brother who is hiding some very old secret that might make him a member of either camp.  Then there's Phillip Cox, Eugene's son and Karen's cousin.  He's not a very nice person, but he, too, could be in either camp.  There are a number of construction workers, ranchers, Sheriff's Deputies and a Judge who might be good and might not.  Playing &quot;Who can you trust?&quot; is part of Kerney's dilemna.<br />During Kerney's investigations there are two serious attempts made to kill him.  He is not sure by whom, or why.<br />Okay, you get the picture.  A trio of white hats against a whole bunch of black hats with no knowledge of who else might be friend or foe.  There's a lot of suspense here, a lot of heroics, and, I'm afraid, a few too many lucky coincidences.<br />All in all, I think that MEXICAN HAT is well written with a trio of protagonists that I can really care about.  It provides several hours of pleasant escape reading.	2000-10-20

It may be sheer coincidence, but it seemed that they had both been written from the same plot outline which I'll describe below.  This and A CERTAIN JUSTICE are the books in question.<br />In both books the murder victim was a highly successful professional female who had a number of enemies and was in the middle of several actions that would make even more enemies for her.  In both books she gave no consideration to the consequences of her actions on other people.<br />In both books there were a number of these people who had the opportunity to kill her as well as the motive.  In addition each book had a subplot in which another woman, partially because of some less than admirable actions on her own part also lost her life.  <br />This having been said, DEVICES &amp; DESIRES is a rather old fashioned (albeit in a modern setting) murder mystery in which our thoughtful, brooding, Scotland Yard Detective, Adam Dalgleish, uses his superior analytic powers and understanding of human nature in bringing the case to a conclusion.  <br />The murder victim, Hilary Robarts, the Acting Administrative Officer of a nuclear power plant, is threatening to sue a near pauper editor of an anti-nuclear news sheet, for libel.  She is also getting ready to evict another very poor man from a piece of property he rents from her so that she can sell it.  As if this weren't enough, she is also attempting to blackmail the head of the nuclear plant into marrying her.  This translates into three people and all of their loved ones with motives to murder her.<br />Her murderer makes her murder look like the work of a serial killer who leaves a particularly onerous &quot;trademark&quot; on the bodies of his victims.  But wait a minute.  What an unlucky coincidence!  The serial killer has committed suicide just a few hours before the look alike killing.  It would seem that everyone with a motive should have known about the suicide, but evidently one didn't.  It's up to Dalgleish to figure out which one.<br />Along the way there are a few too many subplots including one about some terrorists that leads to the death of a peripheral character.  If this entire subplot had been left out, its absence would have had no impact on the flow of the plot, as it was purely extraneous.<br />There is another subplot about an earlier suicide that wouldn't have been missed either, as it was, it took a lot of explaining to make it fit in.  Ditto for a barely existent gay relationship associated with the suicide and a red herring of a lesbian relationship that didn't really exist, but was associated with the terrorist plot.<br />All in all, this was still a good book because of P. D. James' superior writing skills, but it was weakened by a few too many unnecessary subplots.	2000-10-19

James' Adam Dalgleish mysteries.  They seemed to be variations on the same theme.  I don't know if this is true of all of her books or if I just happened to pick a couple of books with similar themes.<br />In both books, the primary murder victim is a professional female.  In both, she is extremely competent and has reached a position where her actions can affect the lives of a number of her associates.  In both books, the consequences that her actions might have on others are of no concern to her, and, in fact, she is contemplating actions that might well cause financial damage and social upheaval to more than one person.  She is aware of this but just doesn't care.<br />In both books, these potential victims of our murderee have both motive and opportunity to be her murderer.<br />In both books, at least one other woman, through actions that are less than admirable, also ends up as a murder victim.<br />This said, A CERTAIN JUSTICE is another rather old fashioned murder mystery involving our thoughtful, brooding, Scotland Yard Detective, Adam Dalgleish.  Our victim is a distinguished criminal defense attorney named Venetia Aldridge who is found murdered in her locked office in Middle Temple near London's Old Bailey.  There is a bloodstained wig on her head.  There is a question as to whether the wig was placed on her head at the time of the murder or placed there later by someone other than the murderer.<br />The list of people with motives to kill Aldridge is very long.  With the impending retirement of the current Head of Chambers, Aldridges seniority seems to place her first in line to replace him if she wants the position.  She has made it known that she does want the position and that she plans to make some changes in the management of Chambers.  The man who thought that he had earned the right to the position has a motive to murder her.  The Chamber Clerk who needs his job for another year or two knows that Aldridge would replace him.  He has a motive.  <br />Aldridge has just learned of a long ago bribe taken by another attorney in Chambers and has threatened to expose him.  He certainly has a motive.  The family of a murder victim who was killed by a man who was found not guilty of an earlier murder charge due to Aldridge's defense certainly has a motive to seek revenge against her.  Finally, her rebellious daughter who hates her seems to have a motive to kill her.  Aldridge, it seems, has a lot of enemies, and very few people seem upset by her murder.<br />As the novel progresses, there are two more murders that do relate to the main plot line, and two or three subplots, including one that introduces Aldridge's ex-husband that add little to the progress of the novel.<br />One glaring weakness, at least for me, is that Aldridge seems to be entirely without any redeeming characteristics.  There must have been something about her to like that James could have mentioned.<br />P. D. James is a talented writer, but seems to have a habit of introducing a little too much superfluous material, at least for my taste.  With that caveat, I do like her books.	2000-10-19

At that time,  'Existentialism,' which had come into its own shortly after World War II,  was still very much in vogue.  According to the author, William Spanos of  Harpur (sic) College, it had &quot;become 'the' perspective from which the  sensitive and concerned modern man look(ed) at the world.&quot;  He further  stated that some understanding of the &quot;existential attitude&quot; was  necessary for one to understand the then current general direction of both  literature and theology.  I think that both have changed directions  somewhat in the intervening 35+ years and that late 20th and early 21st  century literature and theology, as most of us are exposed to them, have  become more simplistic and rely less on philosophic thinking than at the  time this text was written.  It is my opinion that much of value has been  lost as less and less independent thinking has been demanded of the  contemporary reader.<br />That being said, there is still a great deal of  value to be gained from this book.  Spanos begins with the 'Introduction'  which traces the roots of existential thinking from its roots in ancient  Greek mythology through early Judaic and Christian teachings, and on to its  current (1965) place in literature and philosophic thinking.<br />The first  section of the book is devoted to 'Literature' and takes the form of short  stories and exerpts from novels by nine authors.  There are a few surprises  here.  In addition to authors everyone associates with existential thinking  such as Sartre, Kafka, and Camus, we find works by more traditional writers  such as Hemingway and Auden.  These last two, along with earlier authors  such as Dostoevsky and Unamuno wrote novels and stories from their own  perspectives that sometimes fell into the existential mold.<br />The second  section is devoted to 'Commentary and Criticism' and consists ofseven  essays, some of which are general in nature, and some of which are  'Criticisms' of works included in the first section.  Two, which I found  particularly interesting, were Kenneth Rahv's discussion of Dostoevsky's  &quot;Legend of the Grand Inquisitor,&quot; and Stanley Cooperman's  discussion of Kafka's &quot;A Country Doctor.&quot;<br />The third section,  'Philosophy and Theology,' consists of a dozen narratives including  Sartre's well known essay on Existentialism.<br />What Spanos has done so well  with this book is to lead the student into an understanding of  Existentialism by starting with stories that seem to be &quot;mere&quot;  reading for pleasure, then following up with with commentaries which, among  other things, begin to explain why these initial readings fit into the  philosophy of existentialism.  Finally, in the third section, he presents  the meat of the text, essays about Existentialism and its philosophical and  theological implications.<br />At the end of the book there are a number of  suggested topics for student writing exercises.  By attempting to write on  some of these topics, the student can avail himself of the opportunity to  show himself how well he has absorbed the information presented in the  text.<br />The 3 step approach taken by Spanos, and the examples he has  chosen, make A CASEBOOK ON EXISTENTIALISM an excellent learning tool for  both the serious student and the intellectually curious layman.  I  recommend it for both.	2000-09-18

There are also many other terms, some common  and some obscure, that are discussed.<br />I think that any reader could  benefit by reading the discussions under the aforementioned topics of  &quot;Liberalism&quot; and &quot;Conservatism.&quot;  There might be some  surprises awaiting that reader.  There is a lot more, and sometimes a lot  less, substance than is commonly understood about these political  philosophies.  Neither discussion fits the negative images presented by the  opponents of each of these political philosophies.  There seem to be  negatives and positives to both.<br />There is also an excellent discussions  on the subject of existentialism and its meaning in the context of late  20th century and early 21st century politics.<br />Just a few other ideas of  what awaits the user of A DICTIONARY OF POLITICAL THOUGHT:<br />An excellent  discussion on the subject of &quot;education&quot; as the process whereby a  rational being is instructed and the political implications of this  instruction.<br />A discussion of the concepts of a political party and what  distinguishes a party from a faction.<br />There's much more to this  dictionary which might be better defined as an encyclopedia.  I think that,  duringany campaign year, this book, with its many definitions and concept  clarifications should be at one's side whenever he or she is listening to  any campaign rhetoric.	2000-09-17

I always keep a paperback &quot;thriller&quot; or two in my car to read  while waiting for my doctor or my dentist or while having a solitary cup of  coffee.  FOXCATCHER falls into that category.<br />Charlie Brewer, CIA Agent  Extraordinaire, has been set-up by his boss, Robert McCall and is in jail  as the book opens.  Mysterious Iranian Agent, Attashah, bribes all three  members of a parole board (Yes, all three) and arranges a release for  Brewer.  Brewer has no idea why he has been released but knows that  something is fishy.  Attashah makes himself known to Brewer and blackmails  Brewer into attempting to acquire, and illegally deliver to Iran, certain  super-sensitive military parts.  Brewer can either take the job, which will  probably end up in his death, or return to jail.  He takes the  job.<br />Meanwhile, after a failed attempt on his life, McCall (Remember him?   Brewer's old boss.) responds by hatching a plot to assassinate three major  international arms dealers on the same day.  (That'll teach them to try to  assassinate him!)  He also discover's Attashah's mission and eventually  gets wind of Brewer's part in it.  <br />All of the above is just the set-up.   The balance of the book is devoted to the progress of these two  themes:<br />1.)  McCall's triple assassination plot<br />2.)  Brewer'sprogress  in obtaining the parts and &lt;McCall's attempts to catch Brewer.<br />Along  the way, we discover that Brewer is really a patriot at heart and has an  almost superhuman intellect.  McCall, we realize, is what we might call a  sleaze who will stop at nothing to obtain his own ends, which are more  about career enhancement and self enrichment than love of country.<br />There  are more plot twists than can be counted.  Just to complicate things in the  reader's mind, some of these twists turn out to have nothing to do with the  plot.<br />Now that we know who's the &quot;good guy,&quot; and who are the  &quot;bad guys,&quot; the questions to be answeredare:  Will good triumph  over evil?  Will Brewer solve his dilemma (patriotism vs. potential loss of  life or personal freedom)?  Will McCall's triple assassination plot work?   Will McCall thwart Brewer?<br />Phew!  Those are a lot of questions, and the  answers can only be obtained by reading FOXCATCHER from cover to  cover.<br />FOXCATCHER suffers from a few too many lucky coincidences and near  misses, some stereotypical characterization, and a lot of violence.

The book opens, after a  short introduction by Pauline Kael, with a fairly detailed discussion of  Brando and his career and continues with a chronological, movie by movie,  discussion of the films he made during the 22 year scope of the  book.<br />Brando's reputation as a stage star was wholly due to his portrayal  of the brutish Stanley Kowalski in &quot;A Stretcar Named Desire.&quot;   His fame as a film star came from his first six films.  These were followed  by many years of poor film choices and lackluster performances.  His career  was finally revived by his starring roles as Don Corleone in Mario Puzo's  &quot;The Godfather&quot; and of Paul in &quot;Last Tango in  Paris.&quot;<br />According to Thomas, Brando never fit into the Hollywood  lifestyle and was very open in expressing his disdain for both the film  industry in general, and for the people who made films.<br />It was  interesting to note that, because of Brando's many years of making  unsuccessful movies and because of his reputation for &quot;being  difficult,&quot; when Francis Ford Coppola suggested to Paramount that they  cast Brando as Don Corleone in &quot;The Godfather,&quot; Coppola was told  to forget that idea and to cast someone else in the part.  Through  subterfuge, Coppola finally got Paramount to accept Brando for the part,  but they were unwilling to pay the large fee that he normally demanded.,   He agreed to a salary of only $100,000 but asked for, and received, a  percentage of the gross.  With the great success of the film, Brando  eventually made millions from this contract.<br />I'm afraid that I've never  understood why his performance in &quot;The Godfather&quot; was so  critically acclaimed, but I do agree with the book's evaluation of at least  three of his early films.  These were: &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;  which was written by Tennessee Williams, &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; by  Bud Schulberg, and &quot;Viva Zapata&quot; with a screenplay by John  Steinbeck.  I think that all three had writing that was superior to that  found in most Hollywood scripts.  This fact, along with Brando's best  acting, contributed heavily to their success and, coincidentally, to my  enjoyment of them.  The reviews in THE FILMS OF MARLON BRANDO are all very  well written and give credit to all those who contributed to the success of  each film.  On the reversie side of the coin, they pull no punches when  discussing the mediocrity of many of Brando's films in the 60's.<br />I can  recommend this book both for its biographical material and for its  discussions of Brando's films.  Brando was a very private man who gave very  few interviews, so it is really a bonus that this book uncovers a little of  the mystery that was Marlon Brando.	2000-09-09

The earliest was written in 1843 by an up and coming young politician.  The young mystery writer was named Abraham Lincoln and, I'm  afraid, that it was his name, not the quality of his piece of fiction, that  warranted its inclusion in this anthology.  It's not that bad, but it's  more of a story of a near miscarriage of justice than one centering on  detectives or good detection.  In Lincoln's favor, however, is that the  fact that the genre was still in its infancy, this story having been  written only a very few years after Poe, the first writer of the real short  mystery fiction had introduced the first fictional detective, C. Auguste  Dupin.<br />I have to admit to being somewhat puzzled by the conclusion drawn  by another reviewer of this book who has opined that the book &quot;doesn't  deliver on its premise.&quot;  What it promises are short detective stories  of a scope covering the last century and a half which have been written by  a number of the better writers of that period.  This is exactly what it  delivers.<br />There are stories written by James M. Barrie (he of &quot;Peter  Pan&quot; fame), O. Henry (who practically invented the surprise ending and  is probably best known for &quot;Gift of the Magi&quot;), Charles Dickens,   Jack London, Bret Harte, and on and on.<br />Writing styles change with time  and the detective genre is no exception.  A number of the stories are  written in the first person, the narrator being the hard-boiled type who  refers to all women as &quot;this dame.&quot;  In contrast, some of the  protagonists are thoughtful and analytic while others are gentlemanly men  of action.<br />I never like to end a review of an anthology without picking  out at least one selection and telling a little about it.  Here goes:   &quot;Murder at Rose Cottage&quot; by Edward D. Hoch is a rather genteel  British murder mystery.  Although of rather recent vintage, it has the feel  of something written in an earlier era.  There is a murder, but it takes  place &quot;off-stage&quot; and there are no gory descriptions or  depictions of acts of violence.  The murder is solved by an inspector from  Scotland Yard who uses deductive reasoning and common sense to figure out  &quot;who dunnit.&quot;  I was impressed by his attitude when he stated  that &quot;Death threats are always important.&quot;  In early twenty-first  century America, it is my impression that the prevailing police attitude is  that no threat to a common person is worth investigating.  &quot;If there's  a warm body, we might deign to take a look&quot; seems, to me, to better  describe the reaction that one would probably run into.  Wouldn't it be  nice to live in a world, like the one in this story, where authorities  consider keeping us common folk alive every bit as important as catching  and prosecuting a suspect in a celebrity crime?<br />The depiction of those  simpler days of more caring attitudes is one of the things that gives this  book its charm.  As I've stated about a few other books and movies that  I've reviewed, this book is not for the type of reader who needs blood,  gore, and a thrill a minute to keep his or her interest.  It is well worth  reading as escape literature for someone who appreciates seeing an analytic  mind at work and who prefers his crimes in a relatively non-violent  setting.	2000-07-30

It was both more than I anticipated and less than I expected.  By this I mean that it was a very impractical book to use, by itself, as a guide to Paris, but was a wonderful book to use to learn about the Paris of the Parisians and  the Parisians, themselves.  Strange, you may say, but by reading PARIS, one  comes to the realization that the Parisian has a relationship with his city  that is unlike any other.<br />As one example of this, Russell talks of the  fact that Parisians are not particularly impressed by their famous authors,  artists, statesmen, etc.  To wit:  When a great man dies, Parisians give  themselves over to grief that seems almost inconsolable, but on the way  home from the miles long funeral procession, &quot;they remind themselves  that for every great Parisian who lies in a vault there is another great  Parisian .....&quot;<br />Russell says that Paris is a city of impulse, a city in which  to act on impulse is one of the secrets of happiness.  This, to me, is why  the typical three day whirlwind tour of Paris is so unsatisfactory.  My  first visit to Paris was on just such a tour (my last one, by the way) and  I left feeling that I'd really missed something.  Following Russell's  excellent advice, I came back a few years later and spent a month taking  life on a day by day basis.  This visit was much more fulfilling and I have  PARIS to thank for helping me understand the importance of taking time out  from sightseeing to absorb a little of the ambience that is the true  Paris.<br />This book is much more than an occasional bit of advice to the  would be tourist.  It is a history.  It is a discussion of the art and  architecture of Paris.  It is a discussion of key areas within the city and  of the Ile de France surrounding the city.  It is also a discussion of the  Parisian of today and yesterday and what makes him unique.  To boot, it  contains countless photographs and art reproductions going back hundreds of  years.  There is a wonderful discussion of the old railroad station hotels  with detailed descriptions of several of them.  I have a feeling that  &quot;progress&quot; has wiped out most of them.<br />No book on Paris would  be complete without a discussion of the Metro.  PARIS gives the history of  this transportation backbone of Paris from its beginnings to the present.  It's nice to know that you're never more than about 5 minutes from a Metro  station and never more than about 45 minutes, by Metro, from anywhere in  Paris.  My wife and I purchased Carte Orange's (Orange Cards - 30 day Metro  Passes) for about $42.00 American each, and had our month's transportation  needs provided for.  The Metro and good walking shoes, that's all one needs  in Paris.<br />I can't imagine anyone reading this book and not wanting to  visit Paris.  I know that if I hadn't been there I'd want to go after  reading it.  As it is, rereading sections of this book, in preparation for  this review, has made me want to do just that.

Any categorization such as this is somewhat arbitrary and, I'm sure, any reader could say that he or she could  have done a better job.  This is particularly true when some of one's  personal favorites have not made the list.<br />I think that Bayer has managed  to include a great number of the better movies produced before 1973, the  publication date of the book being reviewed.  That's easy for me to say  since he's included a large proportion of my personal favorites.<br />Each  movie is discussed from the standpoint of plot, director, leading  performers, historical context, and awards won.  The book is also heavily  illustrated, and the reader comes away from each discussion feeling that he  has learned something new.  I know that I was further enlightened by every  discussion.<br />One movie that I was particularly glad to see included was  Jean Renoir's 1937 &quot;La Grande Illusion.&quot;  The Nazis attempted to  destroy all copies of this film but one relatiuvely undamaged print was  found and reissued after the war.  This is an anti-war movie that Bayer  included in his &quot;War&quot; category.  It was particuularly distasteful  to the Nazis for its message that people who are natural enemies due to  class and social distinctions can, through getting to know one another,  overcome these prejudices.  The fact that one of the four main characters  was Jewish added fuel to the Nazi hatred of the film.  As an aside, Bayer  tells us that there are, and always have been, questions as to the nature  of the grand illusion of the title.  Several possible interpretations are  offered but no answer is given.<br />To find out what the other 59 films are,  and if they are on your list, I would suggest that you find and read a copy  of THE GREAT MOVIES.  This is one more out of print book that could  probably find a large readership if someone chose to republish ittoday.	2000-07-28

Upon first seeing those paintings, I was struck by the intensity of feeling that she could express with brush and canvas.  Wanting to live with some of  her artwork, I arranged to meet with her.  My first few meetings with her  were as artist and client.  Over time we became friends, and through that  friendship, I came to realize how much Karen put her soul into her  art.<br />In her BOOK OF CHANGES, I can see that same deep personal  interaction between Karen and her poetry as I saw between Karen and her  art.  Poetry, in all its forms, is, arguably, the  most personal way of  expression possible.  When a poet shares his or her poetry with us, he or  she is sharing something of the self.  This is certainly true here.<br />In  Karen's introduction she quotes Lao Tzu as follows:  &quot;A good artist  lets his intuition lead him wherever he wants.&quot;  She goes on to state:   This is my goal -- to be led into this work and be enriched by it.&quot;   I think that she has not only enriched herself, she has enriched all of  us.<br />Each verse of Karen's poetry is paired with one of the sixty-four  hexagrams of the &quot;I Ching.&quot;  The &quot;I Ching&quot; can be read  as a philosophical text, or one can consult it much as the ancient Greeks  consulted the Oracle.  Karen's poems have sprung from her years of  interaction with the &quot;I Ching&quot; and, in their own way, have added  another dimension.  I think that we can see this from the following short  poem from the book:<br />I CHING #55:  FENG:  &quot;Abundance&quot; --  &quot;If Clarity is within, and Movement without, one has greatness and  abundance.&quot;<br />Karen's poetic pairing with #55&quot; <br />&quot;IS  ENOUGH&quot; <br />&quot;birds sit on the tree -----outside my window<br />like  the last persimmons ----- of winter ----- beautiful fruit&quot;<br />Quoting  one poem (and one of the shortest at that) out of sixty-four is,of course,  unfair to the book.  After all, things taken out of context lose something  that can be achieved only by putting them back into context.  To do this  one must read the entire book, including the Introduction.  Read,  contemplate, and meditate if you want the full impact.	2000-07-25

Instead, it is a delightful anthology of fiction, criticism, biography,  correspondence, and a half dozen other categories, all having music as  their themes.  One needs to know very little about music, and nothing about  the technical aspects of music, to thoroughly enjoy this book.  It does  help to be culturally literate and to have at least a passing familiarty  with such writers as Dickens, Tolstoy, Turgenev, Balzac, and Shaw, and to  know who Mozart, Beethoven, and the other giants of music are.  It helps,  but even this level of familiarity is not necessary to enjoy the  interesting and entertaining writing presented here.<br />One of the most  entertaining fictional pieces is a segment from Dickens' MARTIN CHUZZELWIT  in which a drunken serenade of farewell is performed on a stairwell in the  wee hours of the night.  The following conveys the feel of this serenade  and of the writing: &quot;The youngest gentleman blew his melanchology into  a flute.  He didn't blow much out of it, but that was all the better.&quot;   One need not be a music aficionado to enjoy writing like that, and there  is much more.<br />In the section of criticism, I particularly enjoyed  Heinrich Heine's musings on the nature of music.  He says that &quot;music  is a miracle.  .  .  .  It stands halfway between thought and phenomenom,  between spirit and matter.&quot;  In this same article, Heine is  particularly critical of French Opera, saying that the then current French  Composers such as Berlioz and Liszt had practically deserted music in favor  of spectacle.  Here is part of his physical description of Berlioz:   &quot;He has had his monstrous, antediluvian head of hair cut off; it used  to bristle upon his brow like a forest on a craggy cliff.&quot;  At times  Heine's sarcasm is much more subdued and has to be read twice to be assured  thatit is actually sarcasm.<br />In the section entitled &quot;The Musical  Life,&quot;  there are segments by writers as diverse as P. T. Barnum, Leo  Tolstoy, and Charles Dickens.  The section of &quot;Fantasies and  Confessions&quot; has works by Lamb, Rossini, and Swift, among others.   PLEASURES OF MUSIC concludes with correspondence from Bach, Haydn, Mozart,  Brahms and other notables from the field of music.<br />The book is  entertaining and contains such a diversity of fiction, criticism,  biography, history, and soul baring that there seems, to me, to be  something of interest to almost anyone who enjoys reading.	2000-07-25

It makes no attempt give any literary import to the postcards that the author has chosen to display here.  It is a book about nostalgia.<br />For me, nostalgia takes two forms;   a feeling of fond remembrance for those things in my past which are no  longer accessible to me for whatever reason, and a feeling of nostalgia for  things that I wish I could have experienced.  These feelings are coupled  with a tinge of sadness.  This book of hand-tinted postcards of hotels,  motels, and inns of the 30's, 40's, and 50's brings up both kinds of  feelings.  <br />Many, but not all, of these places no longer exist in their  original form.  Most are probably gone.  Some have been remodeled and  changed to a degree that they are no longer recognizable, and a few do  remain, still looking as they've always looked.<br />This is not an easy book  to review in the traditional sense of reviewing, so I am taking a  &quot;been there, done that&quot; approach.  I think that's a fairly  logical approach for any &quot;nostalgiac.&quot;  (Like that word?  I just  made it up.)<br />Page 45:  Hotel Muelbach -- Kansas City:  I grew up about 60  miles from Kansas City and on several occasions visited The Muelbach with  friends or family.  One of the things that I remember most was a lobby  decorated in deep maroon hues.  I still associate that look with what I  think opulence ought to be.  I'm sorry The Muelbach's gone but thankful for  this postcard from Zaid's collection.<br />There are other places that bring  back memories, particularly the various lodges around Glacier Park that are  included in the illustrations.  The last time I was in Glacier Park in  Canada, these lodges had remained unchanged.  I hope that they continue to  do so.<br />There are well over a hundred of these hand-tinted linen postcards  illustrated in this book.  I can almost guarantee you that if you put a  copy of WISH YOU WERE HERE on your coffee table, most of your guests will  gravitate to it, pick it up, and engage in exactly the same kind of  reminiscing that I've done in this review.	2000-07-24

She did not express opinions, she stated facts even when the basis for her facts existed only  in her head.  She also had the irksome habit of repeating the same  information many times, often approaching it from slightly different  directions.  Again, I am certainly not the first to comment on this  peculiarity of her writing.  That this book is filled with examples of both  of the above does not take away from its excellence in revealing much about  Picasso and his art.<br />Stein's fame comes more from her position in the  intellectual and artistic community of early to mid twentieth century Paris  than from her ability as a writer or poet.  It was because of this position  that she came to know Picasso so well, and it was as an outgrowth of this  personal relationship that this book came to be written.<br />One area that I  found very informative in PICASSO was Stein's analysis of the alternating  influences of Picasso's Spanish soul, Paris, and Spain itself, on the  various periods of Picasso's artistic development.  In this respect, Stein  contrasts Spain and France in the following manner:  Spain was a sad  country with a monotony of coloring while France was the country of  Toulouse-Lautrec with vivid colors and images.<br />With that as a background,  she introduced Picasso, as a young man in Spain, painting realistic works  in the late nineteenth century manner.  This was followed by his first  visit to Paris during which he was influenced by the paintings of  Toulouse-Lautrec.  (See illustration #3, &quot;In the Cafe&quot;)  He then  returned to Spain in 1902, staying until 1904.  During this period, his  temperament returned to that of his native Spain and he produced the  darker, more somber paintings of his &quot;blue period.&quot;  This period  ended with his return to Paris in 1904.  Throughout the balance of PICASSO,  Stein traced his painting cycles and the people and experiences that  influenced them.<br />Picasso revealed to Stein, and she passed on to us, one  of the main secrets of his later styles.  He saw as a very young child saw,  and painted what he saw through those infantile eyes.  An infant sees what  it sees from very close up and, consequently, only sees one or two of its  mother's features at a time.  An infant can't focus at a distance and  probably couldn't recognize its own mother from across a room.  That infant  would probably recognize an eye or a nose, or one or two other features.  That same child would probably only recognize its mother in profile, and  only from one side at that, i.e., left or right profile, but not both.  This was the vision that Picasso brought to his art:  a recognizable eye, a  nose in profile, and these not necessarily connected in any way that makes  sense to the eye of an adult viewer.  It was one of the geniuses of Picasso  that he could utilize this vision in his art, and it was as a gift that  Gertrude Stein let us in on the secret.<br />I have visited the Picasso  museums in Barcelona and Paris, and through their displays, have traced  Picasso's evolution as an artist.  Neither museum was as instructive  relative to Picasso's thought processes as was this small book with its  many black and white illustrations.  For having providing these insights, I  can forgive Gertrude Stein for all her mannerisms and displays of  ego.<br />Much more information about Picasso and the literary and artistic  personages of his era can be gained by reading this book.

Throughout his long and painful  fight for his life, Johnny had maintained a cheerful outlook, and continued  to hope that, somehow, he would go on.  His father, in writing this book,  made sure that Johnny did go on.<br />I'm sad that some of the younger (I  assume) reviewers of this book found it wanting in pathos, or whatever it  was that they thought was missing.  Perhaps, with the coming of maturity,  they will realize what a remarkable book it is.  The fact that John Gunther  was able to write this book at all, probably with tears in his eyes, was an  amazing feat.<br />The death of a child is probably the most heart-wrenching  loss that anyone can experience.  I know.  I, too, lost a son aged  seventeen.  That was 21 years ago, just three months after my son's  seventeenth birthday.  The pain of that loss is still with me after all  those years.  Just writing a review of John Gunther's book is almost too  much.  How much more difficult must it have been for Gunther to write DEATH  BE NOT PROUD within two years of Johnny's death.<br />In spite of his own  pain, Gunther wrote this book in hopes that other children and their  parents who might find themselves in a similar situation &quot;may derive  some modicum of succor from the unflinching fortitude  .  .  .  .  with  which he (Johnny) rode through his ordeal to the end.&quot;<br />Before Johnny  died he wrote a poem of prayer that ended as follows:<br />&quot;Accept my  gratitude<br />for all thy gifts<br />and I shall try<br />to fight the good fight.   Amen&quot;<br />And this when he knew he hadn't long to live.  What a  remarkable young man!	2000-07-22

Loosely translated it means &quot;Treacherous England.<br />This is an anthology of twenty-two English Country House Mysteries.  Godfrey  begins his book by defining what constitutes an English Country House  Mystery.  There are rules for everything, you know!  He then proceeds to  entertain us with the twenty-two selected examples which are, if not the  cream of the crop, right up there with the best of them.<br />As for his  rules, some of them are delightful.  To wit:<br />An English Country House  Mystery must take place in an English Country House.<br />To be self  respecting, an English Country House Mystery must include a crime.<br />The  nature of the crime must be puzzling.  The identity of the perpetrator must  be kept unknown for a long time.<br />The deduction of the identity must  involve genuine reasoning ability.<br />These are but a few of the rules that  Godfrey sets forth.  These mysteries, to qualify, must truly be British,  preferably upper class British.<br />Having defined the rules of the genre, he  goes on to the works of several of the pioneers in the field and of some  next generation disciples.  It seems that many of Agatha Christie's stories  and novels meet the requirements.  In this book, we are treated to her  &quot;The Shadow on the Glass.&quot;  Works by such diverse authors as G.  K. Chesterton, Dorothy Sayers, and P. G. Wodehouse are also included.   Wodehouse and his Jeeves remind me of another rule.  There should generally  be live-in staff, such as a butler, in these mysteries.<br />I don't think  that any anthology on this subject would be complete without one of Arthur  Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes adventures.  &quot;The Adventure of the Abbey  Grange&quot; is the Holmes selection for this anthology.<br />They're all  good, and it's almost unrealistic to pick a favorite story.  That said, I  particularly enjoyed Robert Barr's &quot;Lord Chizelrigg's Missing  Fortune,&quot; which did violate one of the rules.  It was a puzzle without  a crime.  Barr's detective, Valmont, was the prototype of the early British  fictional detective, and he had a sense of humor.  Many people believe that  Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot was modeled on Valmont.  Barr was one of  the first writers to mix fictional characters with real life people in his  stories.  In this case, it was Thomas Alva Edison.  A piece of advice  Valmont had once received from Edison had become a centerpiece of Valmont's  approach to solving crimes.<br />One of the beauties of ENGLISH COUNTRY HOUSE  MURDERS, or any good anthology for that matter, is that it serves as a sort  of a tour.  On a tour, you get a little sampling of a lot of places.  The  intelligent traveler than uses this information to choose places that he  wants to revisit, seeing much more of what the place has to offer.  This  anthology serves exactly the same purpose.  The reader is likely to  discover new (to him, at least) authors, whose fiction he likes and whose  greater body of works seem worth exploring.  It's also fun to revisit  authors with whom one is already familiar.<br />ENGLISH COUNTRY HOUSE MURDERS  did both for me.  I found a few previously unknown authors who interested  me, and I was able to revisit some old friends such as Sherlock Holmes.   Other readers will probably have similar experiences.	2000-07-20

For any of you who collect movie posters, this book could serve as a catalogue of &quot;oughta  have&quot; posters.  Some, particularly those advertising older silent or  early talkie movies, must be exceedingly rare.  It is obvious that a lot of  artistic talent went into their preparation.  See, for instance, the poster  for the 1895 Lumiere Brothers' &quot;L'Arroseur Arrose&quot; on page 14, or  the &quot;Charlie Chaplin in City Lights&quot; poster from 1931 on page 42.   There are others, many others.<br />HISTORY OF MOVIE COMEDIES approaches its  subject from multiple perspectives.  We are treated to discussions by era:   &quot;The Early Days,&quot; &quot;The Thirties,&quot; &quot;The  Forties,&quot; and &quot;Today&quot; for example.  There is a section  devoted to the comedic talents of Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd, still  considered by many to make up the mold that has been broken and never  replaced.  We look at the great comedy teams, and both European and British  comedies.  Within each category are insights into the times in which each  movie was made, biographical information about important personages  involved in the making of the movie, and finally discussions of the movies  themselves.<br />Some interesting tidbits to be weaned from these  discussions:<br />Question:  What movie made an international star out of  Michael Caine?<br />Answer:  &quot;Alfie&quot;<br />Question:  Did Ingmar  Bergman, known for his dark films, ever make a comedy?<br />Answer:  Yes, it  was entitled (in English translation) &quot;Smiles of a Summer  Night.&quot;<br />Question:  Was the 1961 version of &quot;Fanny&quot; with  Maurice Chevalier, Leslie Caron, and Charles Boyer the original version of  this film?<br />Answer:  No, it was first filmed in 1932 as the middle picture  in Marcel Pagnol's &quot;Marius&quot; trilogy and starred Orane Demazis as  Fanny.<br />Enough of the trivia.  It's interesting, but, in the long run,  trivia is not what this book is about.  It is about the love of movies,  especially movie comedies.  It is a look at actors, directors, producers,  cameramen, and all the others it takes to make a movie, and most of all, it  is a look at the wonderful (and occasionally not so wonderful) comedies  they made through the years.<br />We tend to forget some of the movies that  thrilled us most when we first saw them.  In my case, I am reminded of some  of the &quot;dry wit&quot; English comedies that I once found so  entertaining but had forgotten about.  Among them are &quot;Kind Hearts and  Coronets&quot; and &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob,&quot; both starring Alec  Guiness.<br />I can only give a superficial sampling of what awaits the reader  of HISTORY OF MOVIE COMEDY.&quot;  There's a lot more awaiting the  potential reader.  And, by the way, it wouldn't look to bad on your coffee  table, either.  Your guests would love to sneak a peak at it.	2000-07-13

One of the things that radio did best was to bring classical music into our homes.  Two voices became very familiar to  those who enjoyed this music.  The most familiar of these two was probably  that of Milton Cross, the voice of the Metropolitan Opera's live Saturday  afternoon Opera Matinee broadcast.  The second, and subject of this review,  was Deems Taylor, who gave music talks in conjunction with the New York  Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra's Sunday afternoon broadcast.  Many of the  chapters in MEN AND MUSIC are taken directly from Mr. Taylor's radio talks.   Others come from articles he wrote for various popular and music oriented  magazines.<br />MEN AND MUSIC is written in a manner that makes it accessible  to the layman while still being of use to the music professional.  I think  that the fact that so many sections of the book were written to be read  aloud over the radio contributes to their universal appeal.<br />The book is  broken into three sections entitled &quot;Yesterday,&quot; Today,&quot; and  &quot;Tomorrow.&quot;  Within these sections, the articles, or essays as I  prefer to think of them, are on a great diversity of subjects with no  unifying theme.  <br />The book opens with a segment on Wagner which Taylor  has titled &quot;The Monster.&quot;  After discussing a number of Wagner's  extremely unpleasant personality traits, Taylor goes on to say that Wagner  was one of the world's greatest dramatists, thinkers, and musical geniuses.   As examples of these attributes, he (Taylor) describes several of Wagner's  operas.  He concludes this essay with the following:  &quot;The miracle is  that what he did in that little space of seventy years could have been done  at all, even by a great genius.  Is it any wonder that he had no time to be  a man.&quot;<br />My personal favorite among his essays is one he calls  &quot;The Chick and The Egg.&quot;  The premise of this piece is that he  has been asked to listen to the self composed music of a six year old child  and his reasons for refusing to do so.<br />One of his points has to do with  not confusing technical excellence with imagination or soul.  He believes  these to be attributes that are adult powers.<br />He continues by stating  that the age of an artist should be of no concern to the  &quot;customer.&quot;  Either a work of art is good or it isn't.  He says,  &quot;There is no such thing as a work of art that is wonderful,  considering the artist's age.  If it is wonderful, 'considering', it is not  a work of art.&quot;  He concludes by saying that the child's parents  should provide whatever help they can but should not push the child or  foist him or her on others.  That usually proves self-defeating.  If the  child is truly wonderful, we shall hear of him or her in due time.<br />In one  of his concluding segments he bemoans the decreasing number of opera houses  in America and relates this &quot;dumbing down&quot; to movies and radio  among other causes, and questions opera's future in America.  This was in  an era before TV.  He was both right and wrong, I think.  There are more  opera goers today, but they represent a smaller proportion of the  population.  His fears that opera would die have proved unfounded, thank  goodness.  I think that he would have approved of the greater accessibility  of opera and other forms of quality music due to Public Television, Videos,  CD's and DVD's.<br />This is another book I'd like to see back in publication.   I think it would find an audience.	2000-07-12

In that  time he has become an expert on every aspect of the cathedral and, on his  own volition, conducts English Language tours of the cathedral.  No one  knows where he came from or what motivates him.  Pretty intriguing, huh?   The only problem is that after this setup he disappears from the book.   Unless I'm missing some very obscure connection, he has absolutely nothing  to do with the plot.  I can only surmise that, in Granger's original  concept, the eccentric Englishman did play a part but, as the plot evolved  in a different direction, he became extraneous but was somehow left in the  book.  It is not unheard of for a plot to veer off in a different direction  as a book or play is being written.  Even understanding how this can  happen, I still found this plot abberation to be distracting.<br />This said,  I did enjoy the book.  Granger's novels make good use of persona that we  already know from previous novels.  Our protagonist, Devereaux, also known  as The November Man, is some one we've met in previous novels.  There's no  problem, however, if you haven't read other Granger novels.  Each stands  alone just fine.<br />Devereaux, officially dead, and therefore non-existent,  is an agent for the equally non-existent Section R.  His would be nemesis,  Colonel Ready, is, in all respects a cunning and ruthless foe, who is more  than up to the task.  Ready is obsessed with seeking revenge against  against Devereaux for an incident in a previous novel (explained fully in  this novel).<br />Devereaux is only called upon to perform difficult missions  for which he is particularly suited.  It, therefore, seems strange to him  when he is asked to to escort a defector out of a neutral country under  seemingly simple circumstances.  He's right, too.  He has been set up by  Ready and the simple task nearly costs him his life.As it is, he is  caught up in the middle of two defections; the one he was handling, and a  second which involves a 14 year old Czechoslovakian actress who. while on  tour in America, sees a television newscast about a religious miracle  involving a weeping statue of the infant of Prague.  This  &quot;miracle&quot; has occurred in a small church in Chicago.  She  believes this to be a sign to her and she decides to defect.<br />The two  seemingly independent defections are somehow connected in a way that  Devereaux finally figures out.  He is placed in a position where he must  return the young actress to the Czechs or the life of the woman he loves  will be forfeited.  I think that one should read the book to find out how  this is resolved.  <br />There is a final showdown between Devereaux and Ready  that feels a little anticlimactic but couldn't be left out or the book  would seem unfinished.  Again, I think that you should read the book to  understand this ending.<br />I liked the fact that Devereaux is no superman  capable of superhuman feats, he feels fear and depression just like the  rest of us.  He is of superior intellect, but so are a few others  including, particularly, Colonel Ready.<br />In spite of my complaint at the  beginning of this review, I think that this is a superior piece of Cold War  Spy Fiction, and that anyone who enjoys that genre will enjoy THE INFANT OF  PRAGUE.	2000-07-07

It is conveniently set up in traditional encyclopedic format, i.e., all entries are in alphabetical order.<br />There  are 25,000 entries including the stories of over 500 operas and discussions  of about 650 of the most memorable arias, duets, and choruses.<br />There are  entries on world premiers of all listed operas and American premieres as  well as performances on radio and TV.  It also includes listings of  childrens operas.<br />This is only the beginning.  You can also look up your  favorite character from almost any opera, over 900 of them, in fact.  There  are biographies of composers, librettists, conductors, performers,  choreographers, and members of almost all of the associated crafts.<br />It is  also a true encyclopedia when it comes to definitions of technical terms  associated with opera, and, even defines various kinds of opera.<br />The only  shortcoming that I can find has to do with age.  Because of the publication  date, it has no listings of operas written in the last third of the 20th  century.  Since the vast majority of the current operatic repertoire  predates that period, this doesn't cause much of a problem.<br />In addition,  I have found the listed biographies of famous opera stars of the past to be  very useful.  If, as I occasionally do, I come across an old recording  featuring someone no longer performing, I am able to to find out a little  about that person.  This happened recently when I found an old recording by  Rosa Ponzelle.<br />Many of you have probably seen Gian-Carlo Menotti's AMAHL  AND THE NIGHT VISITOR on TV around Christmas time.  You know the one.  It's  about the poor little cripppled boy who offers his crutches as a gift to  the Christ Child and is miraculously cured.  I'll bet that you didn't know  that it was actually written for TV and premiered on NBC.  This is all  covered in the entry for the opera.  I found this bit of information  interesting as I'd never heard it in conjunction with any TV performance  that I'd seen.<br />Open it at random to any page and, if you enjoy opera,  you'll find something of interest.  When getting ready to attend an opera,  or even after seeing one and needing some clarification about a character,  his or her motivation, or the plot itself, this encyclopedia will really  prove its worth.<br />The synopses are shorter than in some other references  and therefore more accessible to the opera goer who has limited time to  prepare for his attendance at an opera.	2000-07-05
US	50368037	R3VVIMJ9IC0PQY	0385043244	716777520	The New Milton Cross' Complete Stories of the Great Operas	Books	5	36	36	N	N	Well Written, Easily Read. Act By Act Synopses	The first music reference books that I owned were by Milton Cross.  Even now, with a shelf full of opera references, his COMPLETE STORIES OF THE GREAT OPERAS is the first book that I consult when I am looking for a well  written, easily read, act by act synopsis of an opera.  As an added bonus,  Cross begins each opera write up with a paragraph which includes a few  pertinent facts about the composer and the circumstances surrounding the  writing of the particular opera.<br />In addition to the slightly more than  seventy-five operas discussed, he has also included sections on how to  enjoy an opera, a history of opera, and a discussion of ballet in  opera.<br />As I do before attending a Shakesperean play, (see my review of  SHAKESPEARE A TO Z.) I find it helpful to prepare ahead of time by reading  about the opera I am about to attend.  Cross's book is fairly detailed,  leading you through all the significant actions, and accompanying music, of  each act in the order that they occur.  I often supplement this reading  with shorter, more succinct discussions in other references.  There is a  real value to owning multiple references on the same subject.<br />Included in  this book are most of the operas that are in the normal reportoire of any  contemporary opera company.  Only the newer and/or experimental operas  written in the latter part of the twentieth century are missing, and they  are not often performed.<br />In his chapter on enjoying the opera, he states,  as I did above, that for full enjoyment of an opera, you need to already  understand it.  Understanding, according to Cross, can come from some, or  all, of the following:   Read a libretto.  Read the story.  Listen to the  music either on a recording or in an instrumental transcription.  <br />He  also reminds the reader that opera plots are often weak and illogical.   Some are filled with obscure symbolism, some based on legend, and some just  plain puzzling.  The music is what is important.<br />He suggests other, more  extensive, forms of preparation that are probably too time consuming for  the contemporary opera goer, but I agree with him that some sort of  preparation will certainly enhance your enjoyment.  <br />The last two  sections of the book, one on the history of opera from the sixteenth  century to the present, and the other on the use of ballet in opera, are  more appropriately read than summarized.  These sections are interesting  and are readable on a stand alone basis.  <br />The bulk of the book,  exclusive of the last three sections, is a reference and is most useful for  the purpose of preparing yourself for an opera performance that you are  about to attend.<br />This is an invaluable reference and belongs on the shelf  of any opera goer or potential opera goer.	2000-07-04
US	50368037	RKMVAYBALR6JQ	0838321488	605069406	Existentialism & Humanism	Books	5	23	25	N	N	Man Is What He Wills Himself To Be	EXISTENTIALISM AND HUMANISM did not start life as a book.  It is actually a translation of a lecture delivered by Sartre in Paris in 1945 at a time when the term &quot;existentialism&quot; was being bandied about rather  loosely.  My 1947 copy also incorporates the discussion which immediately  followed the lecture.  It is interesting to note that, after a few  legitimate questions, the discussion became a series of challenges to the  existentialist philosophy by a M. Naville who was a leading French Marxist  in post World War II Paris.<br />Contrary to some comments contained in  reviews of Sartre's books and collections of his essays, existentialism is  not an easily understood philosophy and there were, and still are,  differences of opinions regarding existentialism, and what it might mean,  between major proponents of the philosophy such as Sartre and Gide.   (Sartre alludes to this in this lecture.)  For this review I will attempt  to stick to the opinions stated herein by Sartre.<br />He led off his lecture  by making the point that existentialism was under attack by The Church on  one side and the Marxists on the other.  He stated that both attacks were  based on misunderstandings of the existentialist philosophy.<br />As is to be  expected, his starting point for his discussion is the basic concept that  existence precedes essence, or, putting it into his own words, &quot;Not  only is man what he conceives himself to be, he is also only what he wills  himself to be.&quot;  Carrying this to its logical conclusion; man,  individually and collectively, is responsible for his own choices and  actions.  No excuses accepted.<br />Another often misunderstood term used in  defining existentialism is &quot;anguish.&quot;  In layman's terms, anguish  in existentialism has to do with the doubts surrounding making choices.   Sartre uses &quot;the anguish of Abraham&quot; to illustrate.  When Abraham  was instructed to sacrifice Isaac, Abraham had to decide if the instruction  really came from a messinger of God, or, conversely, was the messenger a  tool of Satan.  Then, when he was told not to perform the sacrifice, he was  faced with exactly the same dilemna.<br />What I have covered in the last  paragraph was merely the beginning of Sartre's discussion on  anguish.<br />Another aspect has to do with being forlorn.  In oversimplified  terms, this means that we have nothing such as &quot;human nature&quot; or  some predetermined value system to fall back on.  Even when relying on  someone else's advice our final decision is our own. We are truly  responsible for our choices.  How much more alone can one get.<br />Although  Sartre discusses many other aspects of the existentialist philosophy, I'd  like to leave these discussions to those who choose to read this lecture.   I would, however, like to sum up with the following  quotation.<br />&quot;(Existentialism) can not be taken for a philosophy of  quietism, since it defines man in terms of action;  nor for a pessimistic  description of man--there is no doctrine more optimistic, since man's  destiny is within himself;  .  .  .  .  It tells him that action is the  only thing that enables man to live.  Consequently, we are dealing with an  ethics (sic) of action and involvement.&quot;<br />There's a lot more depth to  those few aspects of existentialism that I did touch upon.  For those who  are tempted to use the term, &quot;existentialism,&quot; to categorize a  school of writing or as an excuse for certain excesses of behavior, or for  inactivity, I would recommend reading this lecture as a starting point in  understanding the term you are using.  If it interests you, you might  decide to expand your investigation to include other works on the subject  and, perhaps, to further expand, and investigate other philosophical  thoughts of both classical and contemporary thinkers.	2000-07-03

If you would like a mental picture of Major Thompson, just picture Nigel Bruce's Dr. Watson in the  many Sherlock Holmes films.  A bit pompous, a bit of a stuffed shirt, well  meaning, and above all, &quot;veddy, veddy&quot; proper as only an  Englishman can be.  That's our Major Thompson.<br />But wait a minute, there's  something wrong with this picture.  Oh, I know what it is; this book,  written in the first person (i.e. in the voice of Major Thompson) is really  written by a Frenchman!  So what we really have is a Frenchman, disguised  as an Englishman, commenting on the foibles of the French and along the  way, making &quot;inadvertant&quot; fun of the English.<br />THE NOTEBOOKS OF  MAJOR THOMPSON does not have a plot in the traditionsl sense of the meaning  of plot.  It is a series of observations purportedly from the notebooks of  the title. <br />A few observations from the book will show how successfully  Danino, in his English persona, has skewered both cultures:<br />&quot;A  Frenchman without a mistress is like an Englishman without a  club.&quot;<br />&quot;When an Englishman passes a pretty woman in the street,  he sees her without looking at her  .  .  .  .When a Frenchman passes a  pretty woman in the street, he first looks at her legs  .  .  .  . then  turns to have a better view, and eventually realizes he is going in the  same direction as she is.<br />And much more of the same.<br />There is a chapter  devoted to the problems involved in educating his half English, half French  son.  The Major wants him to have a &quot;proper English education,&quot;  and his wife, of course, wants a traditional French upbringing.  This leads  to sending him alternately to an English Boarding School and a French one.   He gets totally contradictory views on every French/English conflict in  history as well as Napoleon, Wellington, Joan of Arc, etc.  Additionally,  there is an attempt to have him taught in France by a live-in English woman  named Miss ffyfe (with two lower case f's) who could have doubled as a  drill sergeant in a very tough army training camp.  This proves totally  unsatisfactory.  Finally a compromise is reached and the boy is sent to a  Swiss boarding school.<br />All this is written utilizing dry English wit  filtered first through the French author, Daninos, then through his English  creation, Major Thompson.<br />This is not a book that will appeal to the  reader who searches for extreme violence and/or sexual innuendos on every  page.  It is for the reader who appreciates subtlety and understated humor.   I guess that I fall into this latter category because I really enjoyed the  book.	2000-07-03
US	50368037	R34YVJOPCKP4XY	0373621086	29991771	Dzerzhinsky Square (Gold Eagle)	Books	3	3	3	N	N	A Good Man Without Good Options	James Jackson advances the hypothesis that, during and after WW II, any Soviet soldier captured by German troops who either escaped or somehow survived in captivity until the end of the war and was repatriated, was  treated as suspect and was either executed or sent to a slave labor camp.   <br />Grisha Malmudov had been captured by the Germans during their initial  advance into Soviet territory and spent the duration of the war as a slave  laborer in German manufacturing plants.  At the end of the war, he was  lucky enough to be in a zone that was captured by U. S. forces.  The U. S.,  in spite of almost certainly knowing the fate awaiting repatriated Soviet  soldiers who had only recently been allies, chose the easy way out and sent  them back to their probable deaths at Stalin's hands.  I have no reason to  believe that Jackson is wrong in describing our culpability and Soviet  inhumanity. <br />Grisha, however, along with a few other lucky Soviet  captives, was offered the option of being given a new identity and smuggled  back into Russia in return for some minor spy activity.  Feeling that he  had no other option, he accepted the offer.<br />DZERZHINSKY SQUARE is unusual  for this genre of book in that Grisha is presented as a real, feeling human  being with a past, a family, and the whole gamut of human emotions.  The  Communist Party Functionaries, however, are stereotypical, wooden  bureaucrats.<br />The tragedy of this story is that once Grisha is back and  living under his assumed identy of Alexander Kuznetsov, he realizes that he  can never see his wife and daughter again.  Exposure could endanger not  only his own life, but that of his wife who believes him dead, and his  daughter.<br />For over 30 years he manages to sustain this fiction.  He  advances in his career to Chief Engineer of a motor manufacturing plant but  remains a bachelor with no close friends and no real life.<br />What he has  always feared eventually comes to pass, and he is found out, publicly tried  as a traitor, found guilty, and executed by firing squad.  At the time of  his capture he does manage to reestablish contact with his wife and feels  the relief of having a load lifted from his back.<br />This is not a  traditional spy story.  It is the story of a man burdened by the necessity  of living his whole life fearing exposure.  Grisha is a man who loved his  country and was betrayed by that very country.  It is a sad story of a good  man in a less than good world.  He had to turn his back on his very reason  for existing in order to go on existing.  How sad!<br />DZERZHINSKY SQUARE has  anti-Soviet propaganda as a background but, in the foreground, it is a  story about one man's love for his family and his country and his loss of  both.  It makes good light reading.	2000-07-02

He affected me in ways that no other song writer or entertainer before or since has done.  By this, I mean that, at any time  and for no apparent reason I am very likely to start singing the lyrics  from one of his songs.<br />For example, every winter when I see the first  department store Christmas display, I burst out with &quot;Hark the  Herald-Tribune Sings advertising wondrous things.  God rest you merry  merchants may you make the Yuletide pay.&quot;  I can't help it, I think  that I've been brainwashed.  This book is further food for my Lehrer  addiction.<br />If you were to see me in a park where someone is feeding bread  crumbs to pigeons you could probably guess what song is on my mind.  <br />I'm  always amazed that so many of my contemporaries haven't a clue as to the  source of my outbursts.  They need this book.  I had always thought that  Tom Lehrer addiction was universal.  Anyone who was around me in those days  couldn't avoid being afflicted with Lehreritis.<br />In speaking of my love  for Lehrer's lyrics, I don't want to short change Ronald Searle.  His  illustrations capture Lehrer's madcap kind of humor.  They have just the  right amount of irreverence.<br />I'd like to see this book republished so I  could make a pest of myself trying to get all my friends to buy it.	2000-06-29
US	50368037	R3GH5VEGI2T6FX	0899666272	187016080	The Idiot	Books	5	23	28	N	N	Even A Saint Can Reap Havoc	I came to Dostoevsky through the back door, so to speak.  In about 1958 or 1959, a small art theater in Dallas, Texas was showing a movie of THE IDIOT that had been filmed in Russia in 1958, under the direction of Ivan Pyriev,  a leading Russian director.  How this movie ever got from Russia to Dallas  or where it disappeared to after I saw it, I don't know.  I do know that it  is impossible to find.<br />All this is by way of introduction.  This stark,  black and white film so fascinated me that I had to read the book.  THE  IDIOT had such an impact on me that I felt compelled to search out and read  everything I could find by and about Dostoevsky.  His body of work then led  me to many of the other great Russian writers; Tolstoy, Turgenev, Gogol,  and, of course, the father of them all, Aleksandr Pushkin.  I even  discovered some of the &quot;lesser&quot; Russian writers such as  Goncharev.  In my case, at least, one good book led to years of wonderful  reading.<br />THE IDIOT, the book that started it all for me, stands on its  own as a wonderful piece of literature.  It can be read by itself, or as a  part of the body of Dostoevsky's work, or within the framework of great  Russian literature.  Attempting to determine which book or which of these  authors is better is an exercise in futility and, if you'll pardon me, of  sophistry.  To paraphrase Gertrude Stein, &quot;A good book is a good book  is a good book.&quot;<br />Dostoevsky did say that THE IDIOT was his favorite  of his books.  Perhaps that was because of certain biographical aspects of  the book.  Dostoevsky, like Myshkin, was an epileptic.  Myshkin returns to  St. Petersburg and its callous society after years of absence during which  he underwent medical treatment for his &quot;idiocy.&quot;  Dostoevsky, in  real life, returned to St. Petersburg after a long absence that consisted  of his incarceration in Siberia for four years followed by an additional  four years of enforced army duty.  These are not the only biographical  aspects of THE IDIOT.  I would not want to be misunderstood, however.   Dostoevsky incorporated aspects of his own life into the book but it is  not, in any way, a work of fictionalized autobiography.<br />Prince Myshkin,  the &quot;idiot&quot; of the title, is as near to being a saint as is  possible for a flesh and blood human being.  His saintliness is accompanied  by naivete.  He is naive to such a degree that he cannot anticipate the  consequences of his actions.  His attempts to do good often reap havoc on  those about whom he cares.  Because he loves one woman and pities another,  he inadvertantly ends up being a destructive force in both their lives.  In  trying to redeem one, who is essentially unredeemable, he indirectly causes  her to be murdered.  From the standpoint of pure innocence a case could be  made that Myshkin was the model for Jerzy Kosinski's Chauncey  Gardener.<br />Dostoevsky is certainly a master of the psychological novel,  and THE IDIOT is a novel that delves into the soul of a man.  He  investigates the impact that a corrupt society has on the soul of an  incorruptable man and, conversely, the impact of goodness and spirituality  on a corrupt society which is unwilling to be swayed.  I wish that I could  say that society was improved for having been exposed to Myshkin, but it  wasn't changed any more than the wealthy of Rome were changed by their  exposure to the early Christian martyrs.<br />THE IDIOT is a book that is well  worth reading.  It is not necessary to &quot;ease into it&quot; by reading  another of his novels first as has been suggested elsewhere on these pages.   What is necessary is to bring a thoughtful mind along with you when you  sit down to what should be one of the greater reading experiences that may  come your way.	2000-06-28
US	50368037	R1AWH4OO3X05V0	0460004220	27779639	The Hunchback of Notre Dame (Everyman's Library)	Books	5	99	110	N	N	When A Public Hanging Was Entertainment For The Masses	Victor Hugo never wrote a book titled THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME.  Some early translator gave it that name.  What Hugo wrote was a book called NOTRE DAME OF PARIS (in French:  NOTRE DAME de PARIS).  This is not a book  that is primarily about a hunchback named Quasimodo or a beautiful Gypsy  girl named Esmerelda.  It is a book narrowly focused on the Cathedral of  Notre Dame situated on the Ile de la Cite in the center of Paris and, more  broadly, on the 15th century city of Paris.  This was a Paris where public  executions or any form of punishment involving public humiliation were the  highest forms of entertainment and drew the kinds of crowds that we would  see at a major sports event today.  If this book is not read with this in  mind, the reader might well be disappointed because he came to it with a  different sort of book in mind.  I would like to congratulate the one  previous reviewer who reviewed the book on the basis of its actual scope  and intent.<br />Now to the human aspects of the novel, the plot so to speak:   There are no perfect angels in this book.  After all, Esmerelda was a part  of a band of thieves who came to public gatherings for the express purpose  of seeing what they could &quot;gather&quot; for themselves.  Quasimodo was  not a misshapen humanitarian.  He had been known to carry out a dirty deed  or two himself.  As for the rest of the characters, there's not a role  model in the bunch.  To Hugo's credit, we really care about Quasimodo and  Esmerelda, &quot;warts and all.&quot;  This is one indication of good  writing.<br />The basic plot, devoid of any embellishments, is rather simple.   Esmerelda, out of humanitarian instincts, comes to Quasimodo's aid in a  small but meaningful way when he really needs a friend.  Quasimodo, as best  as he is able, falls in love with Esmerelda.  When the arch villain,  Archdeacon Dom Frollo, who is also in love with Esmerelda but has been  rejected by her, tries to have her hanged, Quasimodo saves her, but only  for a while.  Eventually she is executed under circumstances where  Quasimodo can't came to her rescue.  Quasimodo throws our villain, Dom  Frollo, to his death from the heights of the cathedral.<br />In a way, its a  shame that when an author creates a memorable character, or an opera  composer writes an unforgettable aria, these creations take on such lives  of their own that they overshadow the novel or opera from which they come.   That has certainly been one of the fates of this book.  Too many readers  have come to it searching for the cute little Disney Quasimodo, or even  Charles Laughton's unforgettable Quasimodo from the 1939 movie.  When it  turned out that the scope of this book was so much more comprehensive, they  were disappointed for all the wrong reasons.<br />A note about reading Hugo,  or any other author worth reading.  One should read for enjoyment, and,  where it is available, for information that will increase one's  understanding of this world.  I have noticed that several reviewers, some  of whom didn't like this book, talked of its length, or of Hugo's use of  &quot;similes and metaphors.&quot;  Anyone who is busy trying to analyze a  book for styles or techniques doesn't have the right inclination to enjoy  the book, to enjoy the atmospheres the author has created, or to get the  emotional impact that was the author's intent.<br />I would recommend THE  HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME as a book that is well worth reading if read for  the right reasons.  Don't read it, or any book, looking for  &quot;techniques&quot; or for &quot;neo-modernism,&quot; or  &quot;anything-else-isms.&quot;  I guarantee you that's not what the author  had in mind when he wrote his novel.  He meant it to be read, not analyzed.	2000-06-27

In a creative sense, THE FORTUNATE PILGRIM is the parent, and the rest of his books are the  offspring.<br />In the hands of someone like Puzo, the creative process is a  wonderful thing to observe.  He relates how he set out to write a novel in  which he was the hero and the rest of his family were villains who wanted  to stifle his writing career; and how, stalwart young man that he was, he  succeeded in spite of them and the stumbling blocks they placed in his  path.  He was unable to write this version of his life, not even as  fiction.  Truth and the memory of the strength of the woman who reared him  wouldn't allow him to deny the impact she had on his life.  <br />Puzo wrote,  but not what he had planned, or even what he thought he was writing.  At  some point he realized that the book wasn't about himself.  It was about  his mother.  THE FORTUNATE PILGRIM's Lucia Santa is the personification of  Puzo's mother and this book is her book as surely as if she'd written it  herself.<br />When we read about Lucia Santa's life in Hell's Kitchen, a  single mother as we would call her today, as she raises six children, we  are constantly amazed at her strength.<br />Her oldest son becomes a Mafia  Union Organizer (read strong arm man and collector of  &quot;protection&quot; money) against her will.  But Lucia Santa  prevails.<br />Her daughter spends six months in a sanitorium for her lungs  and comes home too assimilated for Lucia Santa's taste.  But Lucia Santa  prevails.<br />One of her sons commits suicide.  But Lucia Santa  prevails.<br />One tragedy follows on the heels of another.  But Lucia Santa  prevails.<br />After the death of her son, her neighbors bewail her  misfortunes, &quot;First husband dead; second destroyed for life; a grown  son, already a breadwinner, struck down.  What tragedy, what  misfortune!&quot;  But how does Lucia Santa look at it?  A grown daughter,  a forelady with a hard working sober husband.  One son who has given her  grandchildren and is making a good living.  Another son working on the  railroad and no longer giving her troubles.  Yet another son winning awards  in school.  Yes, Lucia Santa prevails.<br />Lucia Santa is, in every way,  Puzo's mother.  Is it any wonder that she dominates this novel?  The choice  as to who was the hero (or heroine) was never really Puzo's to make.  It's  a better novel and a more honest one the way it wrote itself (with a little  assist from Puzo).<br />Puzo says that, not only is this her novel, but so is  THE GODFATHER.  From his mother's mouth to Puzo's ears, to the written  page, we have Lucia Santa to thank for these books.  Oh, by the way, Mario,  thanks for channeling them for us, the readers.  <br />If you only read one of  Puzo's books this probably should be it.	2000-06-24

It would be nice if Bamford could update us on what has  happened in those intervening years.<br />None of the following is classified  information.  I was an enlisted man in the Army Security Agency, stationed  in the Philippines, from 1955 to 1957.  I had been trained as a French  Linguist at the Army Language School.  It wasn't until I got to the  Philippines that I even knew that there was an organization known as the  National Security Agency (NSA).  Even more amazing is the fact that, until  I read Bamford's book, I had no idea how what I was doing fit into the  scheme of things.  Thanks, James Bamford, for clearing that up for me some  forty five years later.  Better late than never, they say.<br />What I think  that Bamford has done so well is to tell the true story of the creation of  a modern &quot;Frankenstein's Monster.&quot;  He presents a cogent case for  the very real need for communication interception and code breaking in the  early days of NSA's existence.  He proceeds to take us through, step by  step, the process whereby a protector of our freedoms seems to have evolved  into a threat to those very freedoms.<br />According to Bamford, the  communications security community seems almost paranoid in their fears that  &quot;unless we absolutely control it, it's dangerous.&quot;  They are  devious enough to get around any and every safeguard to the privacy of the  individuual that might be established.  To wit:  Jimmy Carter, when he was  President, put a few safeguards in place.  With time on their side, the NSA  waited until Ronald Reagan was President and got him to remove those  safeguards.  (See page 374 of the 1982 hardback edition.)<br />It makesone  wonder:  In today's world of e-mail, high speed faxes, cel phones, etc.,  all using the air waves, is anything sacred or has Orwell's prediction come  true.  As I mentioned above, I'd really like for Bamford to bring us up to  date.<br />A few reviewers have complained about problems keeping up with all  the initials used in PUZZLE PALACE.  One has to understand that no  discussion of the magnitude of the situation can be held without mentioning  all of the organizations and committees involved.<br />It is true that a bit  of hard work on the part of the reader is necessary to get all, or most, of  the impact of the information contained in PUZZLE PALACE, but I think that  the knowledge gained is definitely worth the effort.	2000-06-22

The only thing that the movie, THE LAST TIME I SAW PARIS, has in common with Elliot Paul's book is that they share the same  name.  The movie was based on a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald  entitled, &quot;Babylon Revisited.&quot;<br />I wonder what Elliot Paul would  think if he could see today's incarnation of his beloved rue de la Huchette  where the action of the book is centered.  Before the second World War,  when Elliot made it his home, it was a poor street of &quot;mom and  pop&quot; businesses, small apartments, a laundry that doubled as a  bordello, a third class hotel or two, a few small cafes and, most of all, a  place where one sat out on the stoop and visited, or debated, with his  neighbors until the wee hours.  Not a very high class neighborhood and  certainly not a place that had any attraction for tourists.<br />That portion  of the Left Bank that includes the rue de la Huchette is called the Latin  Quarter because of its proximity to the Sorbonne University.  At one time  it really was a place where the students hung out, but no more.  Because it  has become so touristy, the students have moved their extracurricular  activities a few blocks away.  I get the feeling that every tourist bus  passing through Paris includes in its itinerary a walk down the two or  three blocks that comprise the street.  Every other door leads into a small  restaurant and in front of each is a hustler enticing you to come in for  dinner and to have a free &quot;aperitif.&quot;  If you know where to eat,  or are lucky, you can get a good, reasonably priced, meal there.  The  street is always lively and crowded.,<br />Paul's rue de la Huchette, as I  described it above, was a world, or at least a war, away from what one  experiences today.  He became such a part of the neighborhood that he was  always called on to arbitrate neighborhood disputes.  One young girl,  Hyacinthe,fell in love with him while she was still a pre-teen, wrote him  very adult sounding love letters, and even as an adult still adored  him.<br />He describes a scene when, after a long absence, he returns, and, as  soon as the word gets out that he's back, he finds himself the guest of  honor at the party to end all parties.  Everyone buys him drinks but no one  allows him to reciprocate.  Sometime during the celebration he passes out.   The next morning, not knowing how he got there, he wakes up in one of the  two front rooms in the hotel, rooms normally reserved for &quot;couples in  a hurry.&quot;  Because the room was free and the gesture so generous, he  doesn't complain about the bed bugs.<br />This wonderful street and these  people that Paul loves and brings to life for us are destroyed by the Nazi  occupation of Paris during WW II.  The saddest moment of the book comes  near the end of the war when Hyacinthe, now grown up and become a famous  actress, dies as a result of asphyxiation caused by a charcoal burner that  she and her mother were using to keep warm during the cold Paris winter.   Her death which, like all the events in the book is a true event, is  symbolic of the end of an era in Paul's life and of the life of a more  innocent Paris.<br />I think that I might have liked Paul's rue de la Huchette  better than the present one.  If you read THE LAST TIME I SAW PARIS, I  think that you might feel the same.	2000-06-21

Kodak, however had a  color process made for home moving pictures that had the advantages of  being simple and of high quality.  There was a major disadvantage however;  this process yielded a single copy and no negative.  For his own record,  George Stevens used this color process, in conjunction with the official  black and white newsreels, to photograph the period from D-Day to the end  of the war.<br />These color films remained, untouched and unviewed, in tins  in his storage room until being discovered by his son, George Stevens Jr.,  some forty years after the end of the war.  Luckily, the tins were air  tight and the film had not deteriorated.<br />About 200 pictures were made  from Stevens' film and used for this book.  Max Hastings, a war  correspondent for BBC and The London Standard, has provided the narrative  that accompanies the photography.  Together, Hastings' words and Stevens'  photography, combine to present an outstanding portrayal of the period from  D-Day to the end of the war.<br />I have visited the concentration camp at  Dachau.  Today it is a museum dedicated to the horrors that once took place  there.  In no way, however, can a museum adequately portray those horrors.  Stevens' picture, on page 165, of a stack of emaciated corpses that the  Nazi's had been unable to cremate before the Allies liberated Dachau,  portrays that horror better than any sterile museum could hope to  do.<br />From the beaches of Normandy to French cities that are little more  than heaps of rubble, to defeated Germans looking through coils of barbed  wire, to Generals in unsoiled uniforms, to battle scenes, to the triumphant  parade up the Champs Elysees after the recapture of Paris, and to the  signing of the German surrender, Stevens and his camera were  there.<br />Hastings, in words, tells us of dismal failures and triumphant  victories, of brilliant tactics and horrible blunders.  He brings the war  back to life in a style that never bores and always intrigues.<br />This is a  readable, beautifully photographed history of the final months of WW II.  By reading and viewing it, one will experience both the heroism of battle  and the horror of war.

He came from a society family, and those he satirized in his cartoons were members of New  York's social set.  Family, so to speak.<br />Many of his cartoons seemed to  be just simple line drawings.  Looks, however, are often deceiving.  He  knew exactly what he wanted and he would often rework the same cartoon  hundreds of times to achieve the exact effect he was looking for.  He was  known to work up to forty hours at a stretch in order to get just the right  result.<br />His style was unique, and almost anyone who has seen even a few  of his cartoons can identify his work on sight.  His cartoons satirize the  foibles of New York's upper crust, but never in a mean or cruel way.  There's a touch of love and a touch of naivete in even his most risque  cartoons.<br />PETER ARNO, after a short introduction lets the approximately  250 cartoons that comprise this book speak for themselves.<br />One cartoon  really is worth a thousand words, so I won't try to describe individual  cartoons here.  In other words, in order to get the true impact out of  these cartoons you've got to see them.  If you're lucky enough to find a  copy of PETER ARNO by Peter Arno, I'd recommend that you grab it up, sit  back, and have a few good chuckles.	2000-06-18
US	50368037	R3RGAQAICVTPTV	0060809248	591439555	The Phantom of the Opera: The Original Novel	Books	3	76	89	N	N	More Lon Chaney Than Michael Crawford	THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is as much a story of the Paris Opera House as it is the tale of that misfigured creature known as the ghost, or the phantom.  Without the architectural peculiarities of the real opera house, which  have been put to good use in this novel, there could have been no phantom.   There is a real subterranean lake in the nether regions of the opera house.   There is an interconnected maze of corridors, stairways, chutes, ladders,  and lifts of such great complexity that it is easy to get lost.  To put  this in perspective, over 2,500 doors have been counted and there are  certainly more.  Many of the corridors remain in almost perpetual darkness.   This setting could certainly provide a home for the vast, almost subhuman  culture of door-closers and other creatures of darkness that inhabit  Leroux's opera house.<br />The phantom, as depicted by Gaston Leroux, is  definitely not the rather benign Michael Crawford of the Broadway Musical.   Leroux's phantom is a monster, blackmailer, kidnapper and murderer.  In  looks, he is more like the Lon Chaney of the silent movie.<br />During one of  his frequent visits to the Paris Opera, Leroux came across a legend of a  mysterious ghost who was supposed to have lived in the lower reaches of the  theater and to have been responsible for several murders.  It took him less  than three months in 1911 to convert this story into THE PHANTOM OF THE  OPERA.  The book was not a success.  Only because, in the mid 1920's,  Universal Studios was looking for a new role for Lon Chaney and decided  that this was perfect, did PHANTOM get a new life.<br />The plot is rather  simple.  Beautiful Girl is a member of the opera chorus.  Phantom, very  knowledgeable in these things, recognizes a great voice and a career that  needs a bit of help.  Phantom contrives an accident that gives Beautiful  Girl the opportunity to sing a lead role.  Phantom falls in love with  Beautiful Girl, kidnaps her, and holds her captive in his subterranean  hideaway.  Beautiful girl has some feelings for Phantom, but, particularly  after seeing his face, cannot reciprocate his love.  Protagonist tries to  rescue Beautiful Girl but is caught in Phantom's deadly booby trap.  At the  last possible moment, Beautiful Girl helps Protagonist escape.  Phantom  dies.  Beautiful Girl empathises with Phantom after his death but lives  happily ever after with Protagonist.<br />The above is an obvious  simplification.  To get the real sense of the terror and the eerie  atmosphere of the story, and of the opera house, itself, one must read the  book.  The characterizations are a bit flat, but hold up well enough when  compared to much of the genre fiction written today.  <br />I've noticed that  more than a few of the readers who have previously reviewed PHANTOM OF THE  OPERA have stated that this is &quot;the best book I've ever read,&quot; or  in one case that it is &quot;the best book ever written.&quot;  I'd like to  caution against that sort of statement.  Whan calling any book the best,  you are saying something about yourself.  The first thing that a thoughtful  person might conclude is that you're probably not very well read.  What  about the books of Tolstoy, or Dostoevsky, or any of hundreds, or perhaps  thousands, of other excellent authors.  There really are an awful lot of  outstanding authors out there.  Alternately, our hypothetical thoughtful  person might conclude that you're just not a very good judge of literary  quality.  A review in your own words that leaves out the superlatives might  prove much more valuable to the person seeking guidance in selecting a  book.<br />One other comment:  If a student in a class that I were teaching  told me that this book is &quot;Classic Leroux,&quot;  I would probably ask  him or her what makes it typical of Leroux's body of work, for that's what  a classic example is.  Then, because it is common knowledge that no other  examples of his work are readily available, Iwould have to conclude that  the author of this statement had no basis for this judgement.<br />Now, what  would be my recommendation to a potential reader?  If you're looking for  some light reading, or if you'd like to read the book that started the  whole PHANTOM tradition and, additionally, was the source of the whole  horror movie genre, I would recommend it.  It is of historical significance  for the movie and play goers of today.	2000-06-17
US	50368037	R14FUV627A7U6I	0393316882	434287100	The Complete Plays of Gilbert and Sullivan	Books	4	13	13	N	N	I Still remember My Mother's Old 78's	Back in prehistoric times when records were brittle things and only came in one speed, 78 RPM's, one of my mother's favorite albums was &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore.&quot;  She played it frequently.  Too young to understand the  satire, I was attracted by the catchy music.  I loved to hear the captain  sing &quot;I am the Captain of the Pinafore,&quot; immediately followed by  the response of the chorus.  This plus &quot;Poor Little Buttercup&quot;  and &quot;The Ruler of the Queen's Navee&quot; made a fan of me for  life.<br />Several years later, and after having attended performances of  several of these comic operas, I began to read Gilbert's lyrics.  I must  confess that I got much greater enjoyment out of reading lyrics that were  from Gilbert and Sullivan performances that I had attended.  I think that  must be because neither the words nor the music are nearly as enjoyable in  the absence of the other.  <br />I have read that Gilbert and Sullivan had a  very stormy relationship.  I'm glad that they managed to work together as  often as they did because they really complemented one another.  What they  accomplished as a team speaks for itself in the continued performance of so  many of their works over a hundred years after they were first  performed.<br />I have an older hardback of THE COMPLETE PLAYS and I found  some humor in the following which may have been corrected in later copies.   The book starts off with Chronological Biographies of each man.  In  Gilbert's it states&lt; &quot;first meeting with Arthur Sullivan autumn of  1870.&quot;  In Sullivan's we find the following.  &quot;Met W. S. Gilbert  1871.&quot;  Something metaphysical afoot perhaps.<br />In summary, in my  opinion, the works in this book, while certainly enjoyable reading, were  really meant to be performed in order to give maximum enjoyment.  Others  may very well disagree with this opinion and I see nothing wrong with that.	2000-06-16

Because of this gap in my higher education, I am able to approach my review with no preconceived  attitudes about what Mr. Koontz writes or how this book compares to his  others.<br />Koontz doesn't paint a pretty picture of our super secret  agencies and their methods and motivations.  He also has a couple of bones  to pick with real agencies and about which he gets a bit preachy.  The  first bone has to do with the attack on The Branch Davidian compound in  1982.  The second has to do with the serious injustice of a great number of  the questionably valid seizures of assets resulting from frequently  unfounded accusations of criminal activities.  (I've got a lot of  adjectives in that sentence, but I really think that &quot;injustice&quot;  {not an adjective}, &quot;questionably,&quot; and &quot;unfounded&quot; are  appropriate to the discussion.)<br />My reading elsewhere, of fact based  reports, supports Koontz's accusations.  I wonder, however, if he didn't go  a bit overboard in this novel.<br />We start with a super secret government  agency that seems almost omnipotent.  This agency knows, or can find out,  who you are, where you are, what you're doing, and how to destroy you.  The  head of this agency, Roy Miro, is a psychotic madman who, among other  things, believes himself to be some sort of angel of death who has been  placed on this planet to put unhappy people out of their misery.  It seems  that those he kills are much better off than those whom he believes deserve  punishment of his making.<br />His nemesis, our protagonist, Spencer, or  Grant, or one of several other aliases, just wants to be left alone and  live in absolute anonymity.  Only his accidental involvement with a woman  who knows too much about Roy's operation turns Spencer into Roy's target  and obsession.<br />Most of the novel is a series of chases where Roy  seemingly holds all the trump cards.  (Mixed Metaphor - Yeah, I know.)  Spencer, at first alone, and later in the company of his mystery woman,  through, skill, ingenuity, and an awful lot of luck and improbable  coincidence, survives everything Roy can throw his way and seems to have a  new lease on life as the sun sets in the west.  But wait!  Roy, the  indefatigable, has teamed up with a female counterpart who is at least as  evil and dangerous as Roy, himself.  As our book draws to a close, we find  Roy and his new help-mate doing their best to reshape the world to suit  themselves.<br />Is there another encounter looming just over the horizon?   Who knows?  Knowledge of how they all got to this point, at what costs, and  where they are going next, will be your reward for reading this novel.	2000-06-15

After stating that it was nonsensical to even think  in terms of the ten best novels in the world, Maugham did come up with a  reluctant list that became the basis for the essays in this book, one essay  for each author and his novel that appeared on his final list.  Today's  reader is left to decide for himself or herself if this fifty year old list  would be much different had it been compiled today.<br />In what I believe to  be a moment of insight, Maugham outlined those things that he believed a  novelist had a right to expect from his readers, and, conversely, what a  reader had every right to expect from a novel.  These insights certainly  hold true today.<br />A novelist has the right to expect that his readers will  have the ability and willingness to read and comprehend a novel of three or  four hundred pages.  Further, the reader should bring to the table enough  imagination to be able to visualize the scenes and portraits that the  novelist creates.  Finally, the novelist has the right to expect his  readers to have enough of what he calls sympathy, and I call empathy, to  enter into the lives and emotions of his characters.<br />In return, a good  novel should provide a widely interesting theme and a coherent and  persuasive plot with a conclusion that is consistent with the beginning and  middle.  The individual episodes in the novel should have logical  probability and should advance the main theme.  The characters in a novel  should be fully developed characters, and their actions and speech should  be consistent with their characters.<br />With this in mind, Maugham proceeds  to show why, since every author is an individual, flawed human being, it is  impossible for a novelist or his novel to attain perfection.<br />Each of his  essays consists of a biographical outline of the subject novelist,  frequently concentrating on that novelist's weaknesses and character flaws  and showing how, in spite of (or because of) these flaws, a great novel  came to be written.<br />The biographical material, which seems to have been  well researched, contains a great amount of material with which I was not  familiar.  This information alone makes the book well worth reading even  for those readers (most of us?) who don't necessarily agree with Maugham's  choices.	2000-06-14

In his acknowledgements, he gives due credit to Graham Greene as follows:  &quot;Without GrahamGreene this book  would never have come about.  After Graham Greene's OUR MAN IN HAVANA the  notion of ................ &quot;  With  that out of the way, THE TAILOR OF PANAMA is pure John le Carre and is his  alone.  Like most of the better spy genre authors, le Carre had to make  some adjustments in theme since the end of the Cold War.  In my opinion, he  again shows that he is up to the task in THE TAILOR OF PANAMA.<br />Andy  Osnard, &quot;young Mr. Osnard&quot; to his rather pompous, conspiracy  minded, Intelligence chief back in London, is posted to the Panamanian  Embassy with the express objective of finding a plot to take over the canal  when the Americans leave.  He rightly understands that he is to find a plot  even if none exists.  &quot;Young Mr. Osnard,&quot; has larceny in his  heart and sees this posting as a golden opportunity to get rich.<br />As his  man in Panama, he picks Harry Pendel, gentlemen's tailor to the rich and  powerful.    Harry is already living a double life.  He is actually an  ex-convict who learned tailoring in a British prison.  He has come to  Panama and invented a background for himself that has him being the junior  partner of what was once London's finest tailor shop, and who relocated to  Panama after the heart-wrenching death of his beloved partner.  He has also  gotten himself into serious financial difficulties in Panama.<br />Along comes  &quot;young Mr. Osnard&quot; with threats to expose Harry if he refuses to  spy on his important clientele.  Along with the threats are promises of  substantial monetary gain if he cooperates.  Harry succumbs to the  combination of the stick and the carrot.<br />In reality Harry is privy to  nothing, but there's really nothing to be privy to anyway.  This doesn't  present much of a problem to a man with Harry's creative imagination.   Before long there is anetwork of spies made up entirely of Harry and his  creativity.  There is &quot;the silent opposition&quot; and the  &quot;students&quot; and the &quot;fishermen&quot; and the mysterious folk  from &quot;the other side of the bridge.&quot;  There are clandestine  meetings between high ranking Pandamanian officials and mysterious foreign  delegations, and even a serious plot to build a bigger, better canal.  And  above all, there is the threat of rebellion and violence.  Harry's  information leaves no doubt that revolution is brewing.<br />As if this wasn't  trouble enough, there is a real meeting of a small powerful group of  millionaire power brokers and military opportunists back in Jolly Old  England.  These movers and shakers can make the unbelievable believable to  the public in order to justify a military takeover of the canal.  To top  this off, a few highly placed British politicians need a boost in their  popularity to keep their careers moving.  The Panama plot is just what they  need.<br />This tale of deviousness, incompetence, lies, ambitions run amok,  and con artists conning other con artists keeps us chuckling until we  realize its explosive nature.  By the time Harry Pendel, the spy tailor,  comes to the same realization it is too late.  Way too late.<br />There is a  moral to this tale:  Only the innocent and naive shall be punished, the  guilty shall be rewarded.	2000-06-13

There is a problem with reviewing a book of photographs, however.  Certainly the photography is  breathtaking, but can't this be said of a myriad of other books?  In fact,  there's really nothing I can say about the quality, clarity, or beauty of  these photographs that would make this book unique.  And yet, there's some  way that this book plays into my psyche that insists that I review  it.<br />Conceptually, of course, ABOVE PARIS is unique.  Because low-level  helicopter flights over Paris are forbidden by law, no other book of  photographs from this perspective exists.  For that we have Cameron and  Pierre Salinger to thank for their perserverence in getting permission,  against all odds, to make the necessary photographic flight.  That's  background, but it's still not reason enough to review ABOVE PARIS.<br />I  want to write about ABOVE PARIS because these photos fill in the missing  piece of the puzzle of Paris for me.  I have spent weeks wandering the  streets of Paris.  I've seen her sights and sipped coffee in her cafes.   I've absorbed the atmosphere in the neighborhoods that hold no attraction  for most tourists.  I've gotten to know her from below ground; the Metro,  the sewers, and the catacombs.  I've seen her from boats on the Seine and  from atop the Eiffel Tower and the Samaritaine.  <br />Still, until this book,  I haven't seen her rooftop by rooftop.  I haven't seen panoramic views from  the right bank across the Isles to the left bank.  That was what was  missing, and ABOVE PARIS pulls it all together for me, completing the  picture.<br />If you've been to Paris, this book should bring back a lot of  memories.  If you haven't been, but might go, it's a great way to visualize  the city before you set out.  And if you haven't been and aren't planning  to go, ABOVE PARIS might just change your mind.	2000-06-12

This book is much more than an investigation of three murders, it is  a look into the soul of a nation.<br />A farmer with a streak of independence  is killed by the military in a massacre that takes the lives of his wife  and three of his children.  A soldier, who took part in the massacre, but  may not have fired a shot, is later murdered, possibly by his own comrades  and possibly by guerilla forces.  The murder of a wealthy landowner and  operator of a sugar cane plantation seems to have provided the impetus for  the other two murders.<br />Berlow's investigations into the murders led to a  rather intimate knowledge, not just of the primitive lives of the poor of  Negros, but also of the politics and mores of the entire nation.  Not much  seems to have changed since my years in the Philippines over forty years  earlier.  He describes the inability, or unwillingness, of President  Corazon Aquino, elected on a platform of genuine land reform, to make good  on her promises.  This might have been because her family happened to own  the largest sugar plantation in the Philippines, or it might have been some  combination of knowing &quot;on which side her bread was buttered,&quot;  and concern for her own safety.  <br />In 1957, I was in the Philippines at  the time of the mysterious plane crash that took the lives of President  Ramon Magsaysay and seven members of his cabinet.  Magsaysay, who had been  instrumental in defeating the communist led Hukbulahap guerillas, may have  been the only genuinely reformist President in Philippine history.  In my  time, and in Barlow's, being a reformer was fraught with hazards.<br />Berlow  concludes that the quality of life in the Philippines, for all but the  wealthy, has gone from intolerable to even worse.  After Aquino's failures  in bringing about land reform and in negotiating peace between the military  and rebel forces, over a half million members of the Philippines' poorest  class were forcibly evacuated from their homes by the military.  The rebels  launched a campaign against U.S. citizens, murdering several.  An  Australian businessman who owned a rice mill on Negros was murdered.  The  church gave up any attempts to support the cause of the poor, stating  &quot;We must serve the poor without causing class struggle,&quot; and  &quot;there are people hungering not just for bread, but for the bread of  life.&quot;<br />In the final analysis, Berlow says that nothing much is  changing for the better, and that conditions that have kept the majority of  Filipinos in virtual servitude, at least since the inception of the sugar  plantation economy, show no signs of improving and therefore, &quot;the  compulsion to revolution continues to exist.&quot;<br />If you have compassion  in your heart, this is not an easy book to read.  For the same reason, you  should read it.	2000-06-11

These were Jimmy the Priest's, the Hell Hole, and the Garden Hotel.  An  amalgam of these three served as the model for Harry Hope's in THE ICEMAN  COMETH.  With the exception of Hickey, every character in the play was  based on a friend or acquaintance from this period of his life.<br />The play,  written in the 1940's, is set in 1912.  All, or almost all, of the down and  out residents at Harry Hope's had once lived fairly normal lives with jobs,  families, and plans for the future.  <br />Each man had a pipe dream,  fulfillment of which, he thought, would give him a better life.  Each man  also had a reason why he could never fulfill his pipe dream.<br />The high  point of their lives would come each year on the eve of Harry Hope's  birthday when a salesman named Hickey would arrive to begin his periodic  binge,  For the duration of his stay, the drinks would flow, on Hickey, of  course, and an atmosphere of celebration would fill Harry Hope's  <br />His  visit in the year of the play was different.  A new Hickey showed up.  This  version of Hickey was a messianic salesman who had seen the light and was  determined to sell his friends on the necessity of seeing the same light.   He told them that he no longer needed the relief that booze had brought him  in the past and that he was freed of his problem with pipe dreams.<br />His  message was that they could do the same.  One by one, he dismantled their  pipe dreams and pressured them into trying to make their pipe dreams real.   He succeeded in sowing seeds of misery in each of them, and each soon  discovered that his pipe dream was all he had.  Without his pipe dream he  had nothing to live for.<br />They detected that Hickey might not really be as  happy as he had let on and they challenged him to reveal how he had rid  himself of his problem with pipe dreams so successfully.  Hickey, in an  almost manic mood, then described a life of drunkenness, dishonesty, and  infidelity, including contracting venereal disease and transmitting it to  his wife.  She had always forgiven him for his infidelities and abuses  because she had a pipe dream that he would reform.<br />In his guilt, knowing  that he would never reform, he began to hate her pipe dream and her along  with it.  Because of his fear that she would eventually be unable to  forgive him further, he destroyed her pipe dream by murdering her in her  sleep.<br />While he was relating this, two detectives who had been searching  for him had arrived and heard this confession.  When he realized that they  had heard, he immediately claimed that what he had just said was the result  of insanity.<br />Everyone seized on the word insanity and, convinced  themselves that Hickey was insane, rationalized going back to the pipe  dreams that he had destroyed, and thus back to their harmonious existence.   Each character then narrated a face-saving version of what had happened  when he had attempted to fulfil his pipe dream and failed.<br />O'Neill has  made a powerful case that each man must have his pipe dreams, and that if  you destroy his pipe dreams you destroy him.<br />Although some plays seem to  be meant to be seen but are not particularly readable, THE ICEMAN COMETH is  one that succeeds on both levels.  Read it.  See it.  It's powerful either  way.	2000-06-10

In addition, it is a book about monotheistic philosophy and  teachings, and a book of sketches, maps, and photographs (by Hanan  Isachar), all packaged in an attractive format.<br />I congratulate Lavinia  Cohn-Sherbok and Hanan Isachar for creating this book which is greater than  the sum of its parts.  The text is amazingly comprehensive and the  photography is both attractive and well integrated into the  text.<br />Cohn-Sherbock leads us through a history that is fraught with  threats to the continued existence of the Jewish people who have proved to  be remarkable survivors.  This being said, her prognosis for the future of  Judaism, in spite of the relative security of the state of Israel, is  pessimistic.<br />Outside of Israel, the birthrate of Diaspora Jews, except  the strictly Orthodox, is extremely low.  Intermarriage is almost the rule,  and complete assimilation into the gentile world is on the rise.  She  expresses a common fear that, within a few generations, Judaism will only  exist among the strictly Orthodox, and that they will keep within their own  communities to such a degree that they will live totally apart from the  &quot;manners and mores of the secular 21st century.&quot;  In other words,  they will become, like the Amish, irrelevant to the mainstream culture.  In  the mean time, the assimilated Jewish and half-Jewish population will be  totally absorbed into the mainstream culture, forgetting their Jewish  ancestry.<br />It almost seems to be a case of success breeding failure.  In  our generation, the two main focal points for the Jewish population have  been the Holocaust and the necessity to support the state of Israel through  its infancy.  Within the next few generations, as the last of the Holocaust  survivors die out, and Israel becomes more and more self-supporting, these  focal points will fade away.  As they disappear, so will much of the  impetus for the non-religious Jew to emphasize his  Jewishness.<br />Cohn-Sherbok's solution for the survival of Jewish  civilization is religious renewal.  &quot;The Jewish people have maintained  their special identity for over three thousand years.  If they are not to  disappear from history, they must return to their religious  roots.&quot;<br />Perhaps reading this book could be a first step along the  road to survival.	2000-06-10

For ease of use the book is broken down by month and then, chronologically,  by days of importance.<br />In addition to presenting biblical and historical  reasons for just about everything, it even explains differences in  tradition and methods of observance between various Jewish sects.<br />I don't  read Hebrew, except at the most elemental level, so I can't speak for the  original, but the translation is written in such a clear manner that even  the most complex issues are made comprehensible.  For someone like me, who  is only vaguely aware of many of the less well-known traditions and  requirements, this book is a gold mine of information.<br />THE BOOK OF OUR  HERITAGE covers all phases of the calendar year, holidays, fast days, days  of joy, and days of sorrow.  It clarifies both the meaning of the law and  the appropriate methods of observance.  It gives Rabbinical interpretations  and insights of the Sages throughout Jewish history.  Until reading the  comments contained herein, I never really understood why, as a child, I  asked the &quot;Four Questions&quot; at the Passover Seder, and I certainly  never understood the deeper significance of the answers I received.  Now I  do.<br />This is a reference that should be on the bookshelf in every Jewish  home.	2000-06-10

These and the others all fit into  a theme that Doctorow calls &quot;presumptive nationalism.&quot;<br />The  essay that I find most interesting is entitled &quot;Commencement,&quot;  and is,in fact, the Commencement Address that Doctorow delivered to the  Brandeis University graduating class of 1989.  A theme in the address is  taken from Sherwood Anderson and Doctorow refers to it as &quot;the theory  of grotesques.&quot;  It goes something like this:  The world is filled  with many truths to live by, and they are all beautiful.  Two  that he  first mentions are the truth of thrift and the truth of self reliance.   There is a problem, however, when one of these truths is grabbed up and  made into a cause to the exclusion of all other truths.<br />Take thrift for  instance:  It is a good thing to be thrifty, and work hard, and scrimp and  save in order to get a college education.  You've done well.  But if, later  in life, long after it's necessary, you continue to deny yourself and those  close to you, until the act of hoarding becomes an end unto itself, your  thrift has become a lie.  You've become a miser.  You've become a  grotesque.<br />Or take the truth of self-reliance:  Doctorow states that it  is undeniably beautiful.  Self-reliance was the truth that underlay the  whole Reagan Administration.  In the name of rugged individualism and  self-reliance, the truths of community and moral responsibility towards  those with lesser advantages were forgotten.  In the name of self-reliance,  school lunch programs were halted, legal services for the poor,  psychologocal counseling for Viet Nam veterans and Social Security payments  for the handicapped, among many social programs, were taken away.  The  philosophy that this engendered has caused hundreds of thousands to suffer.   Doctorow believes that much of the homeless problem that we see on the  streets of our cities, and the rapid increase of drug sales, among other  ills, can be directly traced to the advocacy of the truth of self reliance  to the exclusion of other truths.  This has certainly become a political  philosophy of the grotesque.<br />In a way, concentrating on just one aspect  of one essay does this book a real disservice, but there is just so much  food for the brain here that I felt I had no other option.  To get even an  inkling of the connections between poets and presidents, between literature  and lyrics, and between aspects of 19th and 20th century American life as  Doctorow means for us to do, the book must be read in its entirety.  That's  exactly what I recommend.	2000-06-09

The book opens on the occasion of the traditional informal dinner that celebrates the end of the training of  a new class of spies-to-be who will be among the first to operate in the  post Cold War environment.  Ned, who has been in charge of their training,  has invited his already retired mentor, George Smiley, to speak at the  get-together.  To Ned's surprise, Smiley has accepted.<br />All this is in the  way of setting the scene for the series of reminiscences that make up the  meat of THE SECRET PILGRIM.  Smiley, who has attained the status of a  legend in the service, keeps the students entranced for hours and his  comments trigger a life time of memories in Ned, who has been one of the  Circus' key players in a forty year career that covered most of the Cold  War years.<br />One of Ned's earliest experiences, in the final phase of his  training, was when an older hand kept him from making a career ending faux  pas.  He misread a situation and believed that a member of a visiting  Royal's retinue was an intended assassin.  Ned, who was anxious to show off  his new found skills was about to jump the &quot;assassin&quot; but was  prevented from doing so by the more experienced agent.  This was a learning  experience that he never forgot.<br />As the evening progresses we share more  of Ned's memories with him.  One is when a murder is made to look like a  suicide, and false evidence is left that was meant to discredit Ned.<br />At  another time, almost every group of spies that he is &quot;running&quot;  are betrayed, and a number of innocent people are thought to be the  betrayers.  The source of the betrayals remains a mystery until one of the  top men in the Circus is found to be the traitor.<br />We go through many  other life threatening, and occasionally humorous, escapades with him.  As  is frequently the case in Le Carre's novels, the deskbound, high level,  decision makers run the gamut, from the rare competent and dedicated  individuals, to the more common politically motivated self enhancers who  build their own careers with no thought to the jeopardy in which they are  putting their field agents.<br />The evening ends, and we accompany Ned as he  passes the final days before his retirement.<br />With three days left to go,  he is given one last assignment.  He is charged with convincing a rather  unpleasant multi-millionaire to stop providing armaments to various  participants in conflicts throughout the world.  These armaments are sold  through an interlocking chain of corporations which he totally controls.   Because of the international complexities of these corporate structures,  the armament sales are technically legal.  Unhappily for Ned his efforts  are rebuffed.  It is at this point that he remembers Smiley's old aphorism  about the right people losing the Cold War but the wrong people winning  it.<br />If you've never read Le Carre, this book should whet your appetite to  go back in time and read his &quot;Smiley&quot; books.  If you have read  other of his books, I can't think of a better way to wrap them up.	2000-06-09

At that time, all but one of the canneries had been shut down, as the sardines had disappeared from Monterey Bay, and the conversion of Cannery Row to a tourist Mecca wasn't even a gleam in some promoter's eye. I was able to spend my weekends ferreting out the sites dear to Steinbeck while I was reading about them. I particularly concentrated on Monterey, Pacific Grove and Salinas.<br />Through the years, I returned to Monterey Peninsula when I could and visited the Salinas Library, and later, as they opened, the various centers and museums dedicated to him. All in all, I thought that I was a real expert on Steinbeck. It took Parini's biography of Steinbeck to make me realize just how superficial my knowledge really was. <br />Reading Parini's biography of Steinbeck, I began to learn about Steinbeck as a flesh and blood human being. I knew of course, that he had a well developed social conscience and that he had never received the critical acclaim that he desired. Parini, however, brought to life a talented, tortured, stubborn, difficult Steinbeck that I hadn't known. <br />Nowhere are these aspects of Steinbeck's personality revealed better than in his struggles to write a new version of the Arthurian legend, or what he frequently referred to as \\"The Malory Project.\\" Steinbeck had been fascinated with the Arthurian Legends since he had read, and understood, Malory's MORTE d'ARTHUR, at about the age of nine. It would seem that his life-long ambition was to write his own Arthurian saga.<br />Parini shows Steinbeck with writer's block, searching for the \\"right atmosphere,\\" the right paper, the right kind of pens and ink, the right anything to give him the inspiration he needed to fulfill his life's ambition. He even left his English retreat to travel to Italy in search of possible Malorysources. Nothing worked and, in the end, he had to give up the Malory Project. With the abandonment of his dream, his health began the decline that only ended with his death. (His partially completed manuscript and many of his notes about the project were published after his death as THE ACTS OF KING ARTHUR AND HIS NOBLE KNIGHTS by John Steinbeck.<br />Parini's biography brings to life Steinbeck, the flawed man, and shows him with the courage to return to California's Central Valley after the publication of GRAPES OF WRATH made him persona non grata. It makes the reader feel the pain that Steinbeck felt when he suffered critical rejection. The reader lives through, with him, his marriages, his divorces, his weaknesses and his strenghths. I believe that this is the finest of the Steinbeck biographies.	2000-06-08

They traveled throughout Germany, listening to, and putting into writing, well over two hundred folk tales which we now call fairy  tales.<br />These tales, as originally written, seem to be some sort of  morality plays filled with revenge and retribution.  A case in point is  &quot;Cinderella,&quot; which concludes with birds pecking out the eyes of  Cinderella's step-sisters as punishment for their evil ways.<br />In many of  these tales, fraud and misdeed are touted as acceptable ways to get ahead.  This is particularly true when the hero of the tale is taking advantage of  the rather naive everyman who is a staple of many of these stories. A case  of this is &quot;The Little Tailor&quot; who parlays the killing of seven  flies into marriage to a princess who is forced into marrying him against  her will.<br />Many of these stories have been revised elsewhere for the  consumption of children and have thus been made both suitable and  entertaining.<br />Some, however, tend to be dropped from the modern  repertoire because no amount of revision can make them suitable reading.  An example of this genre is &quot;The Jew Among Thorns.&quot;  In this  tale, the Jew ends up being hanged as a thief after being tricked,  harassed, and cheated by a larcenous dwarf.  The moral, if you can call it  that, seems to be that the very fact of being a Jew is justification enough  for hanging.<br />The Brothers Grimm were just chroniclers of what they heard,  but what they heard seems to have been on the grim side.<br />The up side of  their fairy tales is they have given us a wonderful array of characters who  reappear in literature, on the stage, in Disney movies, and in opera.  Some  notable examples are:  Tom Thumb, Sleeping Beauty, Rapunzel, Hansel and  Gretel, Little Red Riding Hood, and, of course, Cinderella.<br />I'm afraid  that I cannot recommend Grimm's Fairy Tales as appropriate reading for  children because they present violence, dishonesty, and frequently, murder,  as admirable traits.  Having said this, however, I must admit that  recommending revisions over original versions does go against the grain for  me.r  children because they present violence, dishonesty, and frequently, murder,  as admirable traits.

The protagonist of the tales, Tripitaka was a real person, better known to history as Hsuan Tang, who  lived in the seventh century A.D.  There were contemporary accounts of  Hsuan Tang's pilgrimage.  These accounts, along with a cycle of fantastic  legends that began appearing around the tenth century A.D. and the stage  presentations which began in the thirteenth century provided the source  material for Wu Ch'eng-en's wonderful tales. (This is Waley's  spelling.)<br />The first seven chapters are dedicated to telling Monkey's  story up until the time he became Tripitaka's disciple.  Monkey, mostly  through trickery has become more powerful than most of the gods and has  rebelled against them until he is finally overpowered and imprisoned in a  block of stone.  He is freed in order to become the first of the three  disciples.<br />In chapters eight through twelve we are introduced to Hsuan  Tsang (Tripitaka) and learn about the origins of his pilgrimage to India.  The balance of the one hundred chapters are dedicated to the pilgrimage  itself.<br />Early in the pilgrimage, Tripitaka acquires two additional  disciples, Pigsy and Sandy.  Each of the three disciples has been placed in  Tripitaka's path by the gods, and each has unique magical powers.  Without  these powers, and the support and encouragement of these sometimes  reluctant disciples, the pilgrimage would never have been completed, as  there are no end of dangers, evil-doers, and monsters to overcome, and  because Tripitaka is a rather weak and timid pilgrim who needs constant  encouragement.<br />The pilgrimage does end successfully and Tripitaka and  each of his disciples are rewarded in heaven as follows:<br />Tripitaka  becomes the &quot;Buddha of Special Merit.&quot; Monkey becomes the  &quot;Buddha Victorious in Strife.&quot; Pigsy becomes &quot;Cleanser of  the Altar.&quot; and Sandy becomes the &quot;Golden Bodied  Arhat.&quot;<br />As is befitting for a book about a spiritual, though  physically challenging, adventure the author ends by dedicating these  hundred chapters to &quot;the glory of Buddha's pure land.&quot;<br />We are  told that these tales are for the entertainment of children and adults  alike.  While I agree that this is true of the content of the tales, it is  my opinion that reading this translation would be difficult for young  children. There are translations available that are written in more child  friendly language.

No Bernard Sampson risking his life to make one more dangerous border crossing.  No Fiona, the non-traitor traitor, nor any of  the rest of Deighton's usual cast of spies, counter spies, and  stay-at-homes.  Deighton, to his credit, has tried something different  here.<br />Far from the cold war in both time and place, we find ourselves in  1942 Cairo in the presence of one Bert Cutler who isn't Bert Cutler at all.   He is really Jimmy Ross who doesn't want to be Bert Cutler but can't  afford to be Jimmy Ross.  We first meet Ross on a train on the way to Cairo  in the Custody of Cutler.  Ross is being taken to Cairo to be tried for  murder when Cutler suffers a fatal heart attack.  The quick thinking Ross  manages to switch identities with the deceased and shortly finds himself in  Cairo charged with finding the identity of a spy who is leaking information  on British troop movements to Rommel, the Chief of the German Tank Corps.   Ross doesn't want to stay Cutler.  He doesn't want to hunt for a spy.  All  he wants to do is to escape before his true identity is discovered.  An  escape opportunity never presents itself.<br />This is not a spy story.  It  is, however, a pretty good adventure set in Cairo and the surrounding  desert.  As Cutler, Ross's life is further complicated by the murder of a  British soldier that he is expected to investigate.  In investigating this  murder, he runs across a group of &quot;special assignment&quot; British  Soldiers who aren't really soldiers at all, but armed marauders who steal  British Munitions and sell them to the highest bidder.  To further  complicate matters, the second in command of this group isn't even British.   He's really German, but none of the other members of his &quot;Unit&quot;  have been able to figure that out.  In the final analysis, this man is the  key to solving both mysteries, the intelligence leak and the  murder.<br />Ross, along with some real British Soldiers and the profiteering  phonies are all caught in the desert in a major raid by Rommel.  All but  Ross die, but not before he has solved both questions.  In the aftermath,  Ross, whose true identity is discovered. is set free and never tried on the  murder charge against him, but to get the answer to the key question:  who  was leaking the strategic information, I'm afraid that you will have to  read CITY OF GOLD.  That is what this review is about isn't it?	2000-06-04

He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism in 1981.  OUT OF STEP is made up of a selection of over sixty of the weekly columns  Yardley wrote between 1981 and 1989.  Although most of these segments  relate to then current events, Yardley carefully chose ones dealing with  &quot;larger issues that transcend topicality.&quot;  To paraphrase an old  adage,&quot; The proof of that is in the reading.&quot;  Although the  events and/or people who inspired the columns may be long forgotten, the  conclusions drawn by Yardley are pertinent and durable.<br />I don't think  that a better way could be found to whet the reader's appetite for the  tasty tidbits found in this book than to discuss and quote from a few  select columns.<br />April 18, 1983:  &quot;Books That Comfort&quot;<br />Yardley  takes as his starting point a letter to the editor from a reader who  complained that GRAPES OF WRATH was required reading in her daughter's  Northern Virginia High School.  Her argument was that her daughter's love  of reading was being destroyed by being forced to read such a dreary,  depressing book as GRAPES OF WRATH and that it would be more appropriate to  choose only books that uplift the spirit and gladden life.  After a  discussion in which he mentions a number of valid reasons for reading  GRAPES OF WRATH including its social impact, Yardley comments that the  letter writewr's criteria for selecting books would eliminate almost all of  the world's great literature.  For examples he mentions Shakespeare's  Tragedies, most of Dickens' novels, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, The Greek Classics  and on and on ad infinitum and would limit a student's exposure to reading  to POLLYANNA, REBECCA OF SUNNYBROOK FARM, and PARSON WEEM'S LIFE OF GEORGE  WASHINGTON,<br />He concludes with, &quot;A child raised on nothing except  good news and 'comforting ideas' will become an adult almost certainly  incapable of meeting life on its own tough terms.&quot;<br />July 4, 1988:   &quot;The Age of Psychology&quot;<br />In this column, Yardley takes on both  the &quot;expert witness&quot; brand of hired courtroom psychologists and  the media psychologists who dispense advice on a moments notice.  Calling  much of this type of instant analysis &quot;psychobabble,&quot; he goes on  to state that, &quot;Were there no psychobabble and no psychologists to  spout it, Phil Donahue and Oprah Winfrey would go out of business  overnight.&quot;  He also comments that television newscasts would probably  have to shut down if they were deprived of their five-second spots of  instant in-depth analysis that &quot;tells it like it is.&quot;<br />The real  pity of this is, he states, that in our exposure to psychobabble we lose  sight of the good that a competent psychoanalyst can do, in an appropriate  environment, for troubled individuals and families.<br />These are but two of  the sixty plus subjects that Yardley addresses.  Each one is interesting,  intelligent, and highly readable  Yardley frequently risks being &quot;out  of step,&quot; not out of contrariness, but out of belief.  all in all,  this book belongs on every reader's must list.	2000-06-03

As soon as he can scrape up enough money for the boat fare, he leaves for Europe.  Just  two years out of college, he lands a job as foreign correspondent for the  European edition of the Chicago Tribune with offices in Paris.  Through the  years the newspapers change and his salary increases but he remains a  journalist and author.<br />The most exciting parts of PERSONAL HISTORY are  those sections dealing with his visits to the Rif where his life is often  in danger as he visits various Moroccan Bedouin tribes, even as they are  being bombarded by the Spanish.  One short entry from his diary gives a  feel of his life in the Rif.<br />&quot;Sept. 4th.  Just after lunch, at 2:30,  Mahdani appeared.  I followed him to a deserted place in the dunes where I  changed into Arab clothes.  He walked to Zaina's, I followed, hiding my  face in a hood.  . . . .  we started across the frontier  . . . .  Crossing  very difficult -- many searchlights, much firing.  None of us killed.  Sleep in a Ditch.&quot;<br />Other diary entries speak of near starvation,  heat exhaustion, freezing cold, blistering heat, and the constant threat of  death from unfriendly bands of Arabs, from the Spanish, and from the  elements.  The flip side of the coin is that as the only western journalist  in the Rif, Sheean's reports created a journalistic sensation.<br />The  longest segment of the book centers around Sheean's experiences in China  and Moscow during the latter part of the successful revolution in Russia  and shortly after Sun Yat-sen's defeat.<br />In Moscow, he becomes friends  with Rayna Prohm, an American woman who had helped to prepare the way for  Madame Sun Yat-sen's escape from China, and who is a confidante of Borodin  and Madame Sun Yat-sen, among others.  Mrs. Prohme is described as  enthusiastic, brilliant, dedicated and charming.  Although unstated, it is  obvious that Sheean was deeply in love with Rayna Prohme to whom he  dedicated PERSONAL HISTORY.  The most tragic moment comes when Mrs. Prohme,  only in her early thirties, contracts encephalitis and dies.<br />Her funeral  was held on a cold, dreary Moscow day.  The funeral procession, in which  there were Chinese, Russian, and American Delegations marched for over  three hours to the crematorium.  Madame Sun Yat-sen, whose money from China  had been cut off, and who had no warm clothes, walked for the entire three  hours shivering from the cold.  She was offered a ride in a warm  automobile, but refused, wishing to show her love and admiration for Mrs.  Prohme.  It is obvious from Sheean's descriptions of his emotions and his  feelings of loss, that Rayna Prohme's death was, at that time, the biggest  loss in his life.<br />The book concludes with a short section describing  Sheean's experiences in the Holy Land at a time of violent clashes between  the Arab and Jewish communities.  It is at this point that Sheean loses his  objectivity and forgets that a good journalist approaches his subject  without bias.  He engages in revisionist analysis of four or five thousand  years of history and becomes an advocate of one side based on this  unorthodox revisionism.<br />Each segment of PERSONAL HISTORY stands on its  own.  I would particularly recommend reading the two sections entitled  &quot;The Rif,&quot; and &quot;The Rif Again&quot; as one stand-alone  episode, and &quot;Revolution&quot; as another.  Sheean's writing in these  segments is particularly interesting.  His loss of focus and objectivity in  the &quot;Holy Land&quot; section should not be seen as cause not to read  the other, excellent portions of the book.unstated, it is  obvious that Sheean was deeply in love with Rayna Prohme to whom he  dedicated PERSONAL HISTORY.

Books	4	18	19	N	N	Another Casualty of the Spanish Civil War	The Spanish town of the title is Santa Eulalia Del Rio, known to its inhabitants simply as Santa Eulalia.  Elliot (correct spelling) Paul made Santa Eulalia, a small fishing village on the Spanish island of Ibiza, his  home from 1931 to 1936.  He did not live there as an outsider, but rather  as an accepted and loved member of the community.<br />During Paul's first few  years on Ibiza, life seemed idyllic.  Most of his friends and neighbors  were simple, somewhat naive, generally kind people who ranged from those  who struggled to eke out a living to those comfortably well off.  If the  rich preferred to stay that way and weren't too anxious to share the  wealth, so be it.  If the Communists thought the wealth should be spread  around, that seemed to be normal for your everyday Communist.  If the  Republicans liked the old style government and the Fascists thought that  they should be in control, as long as it was just a thought, it didn't hurt  anyone, did it?  In spite of these conflicting agendas, all seemed well and  no one thought that the problems on the mainland would spill over to their  little island.<br />Paul brings Santa Eulalia to life.  He introduces us to  the leading citizens in each walk of life, and invests them with real  personalities.  No wooden characters here.  Paul's genius is in making us  feel that we know everyone and that we are participants in the life of  Santa Eulalia.<br />He immerses himself deeply into the life of the village,  and, it is my opinion that if not for the hostilities of the Spanish Civil  war, Paul and his family would never have left Santa Eulalia.  As it was,  they waited until the last possible minute to escape, fleeing to the last  neutral ship to dock in the harbor minutes before it left.  At the time he  wrote this book, Paul was still suffering from feelings of guilt over  having survived when so many of his friends didn't.<br />With the coming of  the Spanish Civil War, Ibiza was alternately ruled by Fascists,Loyalists,  Communists, and whatever other ist's could wrest control.  Each successive  change of power was accompanied by new oppressions, imprisonments and  executions.  The true victims of all of this were the innocent majority who  naively believed that they could continue their old ways of life no matter  who was in power.<br />The day after Paul and his family made their escape  there was an invasion by Italian Fascist troops.  Within a few hours these  troops herded most of the remaining males into a town square and machine  gunned them.  The Italians didn't care whose side the men were on, they  considered all of the islanders to be a threat and thus executed all the  males they could find, no questions asked.  A day or two later, Spanish  government planes bombarded Santa Eulalia, destroying nearly every home in  the village.  At the time of the publication of this book in 1937, Paul was  still unable to determine the fate of any of his friends.<br />THE LIFE AND  DEATH OF A SPANISH TOWN brings a community to life, presents its  inhabitants as real living people, and eventually brings home the horror of  war through the deaths of innocent people with real names, families, and  feelings.  An out of print book that merits reprinting.	2000-06-02

SHAKESPEARE A TO Z, however, is much more to me than a &quot;mere&quot; reference book.  It has become a silent companion  and a private tutor.  Before attending a play by Shakespeare or an opera  based on his works, I read (or reread) the synopsis of the work in question  in SHAKESPEARE A TO Z.<br />Early seventeenth century English. as it is  spoken, is occasionally a mystery to the twentieth century American, and  opera, often sung in Italian, can be even more of a mystery.  Further  confusion can come in an opera, if one isn't familiar enough with the plot  to know whether the young soprano dressed in male clothing and playing the  part of a male is:  a.) a female deliberately cast in the role of a young  male, or b.) a female playing the part of a female disguised as a male.  If   I've &quot;done my homework&quot;  and consulted SHAKESPEARE A TO Z before  attending the play or opera, I have no problem following the plot  regardless of language or gender of the performer.<br />As an aside, I wonder  if it was more, or less, confusing in Shakespeare's time when all roles  were played by males.  Under those conditions you would have been treated  to the spectacle of a male actor portraying a female disguised as a male.   Phew!<br />If I have taken the time to delve further into this wonderful  reference, I have a good chance of also understanding the historical  context of the play and the motivations of the various characters.   Shakespeare is sometimes subtle and frequently devious.  Knowledge of  background and motivation helps to better understand what is  happening.<br />Some contemporary directors add additional confusion by using  deliberate ploys such as having the same actor play multiple roles.  If   I've prepared properly, I am not confused.<br />While I personally use this  reference mainly to enhance my enjoyment, I am absolutely convinced that it  is a valuable source of information for students and an even more valuable  instructional tool for teachers.   When I was in high school, many long  years ago, I didn't enjoy Shakespeare very much, mostly because I didn't  totally comprehend what I was reading or seeing.  Had I had access to  SHAKESPEARE A TO Z, accompanied by a little properly applied pressure to  consult it, who knows, I might have come around to enjoying his works much  earlier in my life.	2000-06-01

Even as Germany's fortunes waned in the latter stages of W.W.II, Goring spared no expense in  providing himself an ever more luxurious life style.<br />His sumptious  hunting retreat became the repository of one of the most impressive art  collections in history.  Using stolen and extorted funds he spent millions  obtaining, for his personal collection, great works of art by the  trainload, most of whose legitimate owners died in the gas chambers of the  concentration camps.<br />Irving's well researched book traces Goring's life  from his childhood in Bavaria through his education at a military academy  where he first fell in love with smartly trimmed uniforms, through his  experience as a Fighter Pilot in W.W.I, then through his early connection  with Hitler and what Hitler stood for in the years of humiliation and  finally, to the years of power as Hitler's second in command.<br />Irving  leaves no doubt that Goring was a monster, a monster who had no second  thoughts about engineering the deaths of countless numbers of innocent  people.  He found it aesthetically unpleasing, however, to actually witness  any of these &quot;unpleasantries.&quot;<br />Goring was a coward who  pretended to be brave and heroic.  He was a morphine addict because he  couldn't tolerate pain, but had no qualms about inflicting pain on others.   He was honest to no one, not to himself, not to his fellow officers, and  certainly not to Hitler.  A great percentage of his energy during the war  years went to fabricating alibis and hiding from Hitler so he wouldn't have  to admit to his responsibility for many great failures, particularly where  the Luftwaffe was concerned.<br />He was an open transvestite, frequently  appearing in public in effeminate clothing, including his ermine cape, and  wearing heavy facial make-up.  <br />In spite of all this, Hitler rewarded him  for his early loyalty by making Goring his heir apparent.  As the war drew  to an unsuccesful end, Goring had grandiose ideas of sitting down with  Eisenhower, and negotiating, as equals, a peace settlement.  He was shocked  when, instead of being treated as the honored and honorable leader of a  nation defeated in war, he was arrested, stripped of all medals and symbols  of rank, interrogated, and imprisoned in an unpleasant cell and fed soup  out of a tin plate.<br />At the Neurenberg Trials, he was not allowed to make  any of his carefully prepared statements and was sentenced to death by  hanging.  This planned method of execution was, to him, humiliating.  He  believed that he was entitled to the death of an honorable soldier, death  by firing squad.  To avoid this final humiliation, he managed to obtain a  cyanide capsule and committed suicide, thus cheating the hangman.<br />In  preparing GORING, Irving had access to materials that had only recently  become available.  He meticulously cited all of his sources and took the  extra step of making sure that all of his source materials were (and are)  readily available to the interested scholar.  GORING is interesting to read  for the history it reveals, for the psychological insight into the mind of  a 20th century monster, and as a study of a society run amok.  I recommend  it.	2000-05-31

Amazingly enough, even though over 50 years have passed, a lot of that Paris has survived and is just waiting  to be rediscovered.  A lot of what I can't find on my own I find in those  columns that Janet Flanner wrote from 1925 to 1939 for the NEW YORKER and  which have been collected for PARIS WAS YESTERDAY.<br />Janet Flanner (pen  name &quot;Genet&quot;) was the resident Paris Correspondent for THE NEW  YORKER.  Her assignment was to write columns about &quot;what the French  thought was going on in France,&quot;  Flanner became much more than a mere  observer of the Parisian scene.  she was an active participant.  Be it a  death, an opera premiere, a swindle, a political disaster, a bit of gossip  about a celebrity, or nostalgia for an even earlier era, Flanner wrote  about them, and wrote with wit and an occasional tongue-in-her-cheek.<br />The  following example of her tongue-in-cheek approach, one among many, comes  from a 1928 column entitled &quot;The Italian Straw Hat.&quot;  It seems  that the French wanted parity with Hollywood when it came to Motion  Pictures and wanted to pass a law requiring the acceptance in the U. S. of  a French Film for every Hollywood made film shown in France.  The first  picture they wanted to export to the U. S. was a film entitled, in  translation, THE ITALIAN STRAW HAT.  Her comment about this film was,  &quot;While THE ITALIAN STRAW HAT is not, as touted, the funniest comedy in  Europe today, it is the funniest comedy about a straw hat to be seen on the  boulevards,&quot;<br />In Flanner's columns you can read about Chevalier and  Josephine Baker (not together), about the excitement when the Louvre got a  new Berthe Morisot and a new Monet Painting donated the same day, about  more excitement over the premiere performance of a Ravel Piano piece, about  a mysterious murder and a new political pecadillo, and finally about more  somber times when World World II and Hitler loomed just over the  horizon.<br />If you'd like to feel that you are in LES DEUS MAGOTS, or CAFE  FLEUR, and listening to Sartre or Cocteau wax elegant or if you'd like to  hear the gossip about the gendarmerie asking Marlene Dietrich to leave  Paris because she had the audacity to wear trousers in public  or if you'd  like to meet James Joyce in THE SHAKESPEAR AND COMPANY BOOK STORE, or if  you'd like to attend one of Gertrude Stein's intellectual discussion and  meet her companion, Alice B. Toklas, then this book is for you.<br />I highly  recommend PARIS WAS YESTERDAY to anyone who is interested in a different  view (not that of Hemingway or Fitzgerald) of the era of the &quot;Lost  Generation.&quot;  I recommend it to anyone who likes a book for its wit  and charm.  If you're not interested in Paris, but just like a bit of  celebrity gossip, there's still a lot here for you.  There's a reason that  Janet Flannery's column ran for so many years.

The Ustashis were a  band of fanatic Croatian Fascists who chose Catholic fanaticism as the  mainstay of their policy.  Since the Ustashi had the backing of the clergy,  there was a widespread belief that, if the Vatican would speak out against  these massacres, they would come to a halt.<br />Bokun, the author of this  book, was sent to Rome by the Red Cross to attempt to persuade the Vatican  to speak out.  One of the threads which weaves it way through the book is  Bokun's attempts to get either Pope Pius XII or some other high ranking  Vatican official to make such a statement.  Throughout the war years, the  Vatican refused to even acknowledge the existence of the massacres.  One of  Bokun's acquaintances asked the rhetorical question, &quot;What is your  opinion of the Vatican's silence on the subject of the Jewish  persecutions?&quot;  He then answered his own question, &quot;How  extraordinary that you find that surprising.  The Church was founded on  silence.&quot;<br />Another acquaintance reminded him that this refusal to  tender aid extended far beyond the Church, giving as an example the  response of  The United States during the early years of Hitler's rise to  power when America was offered the opportunity to provide refuge to 20,000  Jewish children.  Afew Jewish Welfare organizations petitioned the U. S.  Senate on behalf of the children.  Over 4,000 families offered to adopt the  children.  However, a Gallup Poll published in FORTUNE MAGAZINE showed that  eighty-three percent of Americans were against any increase in immigration  limits, particularly if the immigrants were European Jews.  The official  Washington response was to tell the welfare organizations to look  elsewhere.  One can only assume that the majority of these children  perished.<br />In spite of the risks involved, and the lack of any  cooperationfrom the fascist or puppet governments in Spain and France,  through which the fugitives had to pass on their route to freedom, Bokun  and his allies continued to have small successes throughout the war years,  either hiding fugitives in Rome or getting them out using numerous  subterfuges.<br />Eventually Bokun had to engineer his own escape.  Escape  from the wartime fascists, and what turned out to be more difficult, from  the actions and attitudes of the bureaucrats after the cessation of  hostilities.  The end of the book found a weary, fatigued, and  disillusioned Bokun living in a third rate hotel in 1946 Paris.  He got no  assistance from the American, French, English, and Canadian Agencies set up  to specifically provide assistance.  Assistance, he discovered,  had to be  bought one way or another.  Survive he did, however, and went on to become  a successful author and journalist.<br />A SPY IN THE VATICAN once again  provides proof that &quot;truth, well told, is stranger than fiction.&quot;	2000-05-29

These weren't the shooting scripts but have been altered by Mr. Raphaelson  to make them more readable and to reintroduce some bits that were cut from  the finished movies.  This said, this wouldn't be a bad book if  republishing the scripts were all that it did.  The screen comedies to  which the title refers are:  &quot;Trouble in Paradise,&quot; &quot;The  Shop Around the Corner,&quot; and &quot;Heaven Can Wait.&quot;  In this  reviewer's opinion, each screenplay would be a mega-hit in today's movie  market.<br />One, in fact, is.  &quot;The Shop Around the Corner,&quot; which  premiered in 1940 and starred Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart has been  remade as &quot;You've Got Mail&quot; with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.  What  were pen-pals in the original became e-mail &quot;pals&quot; in the update.   Like the original, the remake is warm, funny, witty and has a happy  ending.<br />The Warren Beatty movie, &quot;Heaven Can Wait,&quot;  shares  nothing except the title with the original which starred Gene Tierney and  Don Ameche.  In the author's notes introducing &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;  in the book under review, Raphaelson felt it necessary to comment that  &quot;&quot;The title &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; has been used recently on  a movie that in no way resembles our original film.  I don't know why this  was done.&quot;&quot;  A rather subtle understatement in my opinion.<br />What  makes this book different than the run of the mill anthology are the  insightful and informative introduction by Pauline Kael, the then movie  critic for &quot;The New Yorker,&quot; and the inclusion of Raphaelson's  &quot;Freundschaft:  How It Was With Lubitsch and Me,&quot; which was  originally published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in May of 1981.  Both  Kael's introduction and Raphaelson's &quot;Freundschaft&quot; could, among  other things, serve as textbook examples of the workings of creative minds  joined together in what they do best, creating.<br />&quot;Freundschaft,&quot;  arguably Raphaelson's finest piece of writing, was a memorial to Ernst  Lubitsch (the incomparable producer/director of many outstanding movies).   Raphaelson and Lubitsch worked together for thousands of hours, each  feeding off the other's ideas, whims, and comic utterances, in the creation  of 9 films spanning two decades, the 30's and 40's.  Although Raphaelson  was ostensibly the writer, and Lubitsch the director/producer, no such  distinction seemed to exist when they collaborated.   &quot;Freundschaft,&quot; in addition to being a memorial to Lubitsch, is  also the story of a collaborative relationship and an ode to a  &quot;love/hate/love&quot; intellectual, emotional, creative relationship  that is unique in the movie business.<br />I recommend this book for its  screenplays, for Mrs. Kael's introduction and for Mr. Raphaelson's paean to  Ernst Lubitsch.  You can't go wrong on any of these counts, and having them  all in one book is a real treat.	2000-05-26

A theme that weaves its way through the book is that the optimal use of one's time is to devote it to study and learning - not just  any studying, however, but the study of the Torah.  In Jewish tradition,  time is to be divided between study, work, and physiological needs (eating,  sleeping, elimination, and leisure).  All of our free time, once our work  and physiological needs have been met should be devoted to study.<br />In this  book, Rabbi Bonder brings together his knowledge of the working of the  &quot;marketplace&quot; with Jewish ethical teachings, Talmudic  Interpretations, teachings of the Hasidic Masters, Jewish Mysticism, and  logical analysis.  Here, marketplace is variously described as: a market of  exchanges and interactions which represents &quot;the infinite quantity of  small and great businesses that take place in the universe at any given  minute&quot; and as a place where &quot;each individual's fitness to  survive is in accordance with his or her own perception of what survival  is.&quot;<br />In keeping with the time theme, one of the problems to be faced  has to do with devoting one's time to amassing wealth.  In other words, how  much is too much?  Time that is spent with the objective of accumulating  wealth (beyond that which meets our own needs and is beneficial to others)  represents a two pronged loss.  First of all, the creation of this type of  wealth creates an offsetting scarcity.  Secondly it involves wasting time  that could, and should, be better spent in study.  In contemporary terms,  the accumulation of excess wealth is not ecologically sound.<br />Another area  of discussion is the relationship of God to the marketplace.  Rabbi Bonder  states that &quot;when a person prays only for material gains his pleas and  efforts are wasted.  This is because a curtain is brought down between  himself and God as a result of material things having been brought into the  domain of the spirit.<br />This book has had an impact on the way I conduct my  life.  Before reading it, my standard reaction to anyone asking for a  handout was a knee-jerk reaction that he'll probably just use it to get  drunk.  After reading Bonder's section on dealing with beggars and how  these dealings affect the marketplace, I came to 2 realizations:<br />1.  So  what if he does use it for drink.  He probably needs the drink more than I  need the dollar.<br />and<br />2.  Who am I to judge anyway.<br />I highly recommend  this book.  In spite of its brevity it's not an easy read.  I have barely  touched the surface of a few of the concepts of what the dust jacket refers  to as &quot;a broad and ethical view of economic behavior including all  forms of exchange and human interaction, from how we spend our money to how  we fulfill our role as responsible human beings in a global ecological  framework.&quot;	2000-05-26

He certainly presents an overwhelming amount of  anecdotal evidence in support of his position.  In fact, one of my problems  with the book is its repetitiveness.  Entine tells us something, then he  tells us what he has told us, then he presents charts graphs, and maps to  illustrate what he has told us, then he summarises, being sure to reiterate  what he has already told us.<br />A case in point  East Africans (particularly  Kenyans) dominate in endurance racing.  He tells us they dominate, then he  gives us statistics outlining the events in which they dominate and the  number of records they hold, then he shows the same information in charts  and graphs.  He then follows up with detailed biographies of several Kenyan  runners, tracing each of their lives from childhood through championship  years and, in some cases, through retirement and death.  Enough, Entine,  you've made your point.<br />He digresses, discussing the personalities of  various black athletes had on racial relations.  He digresses further and  discusses Anti-Semitism, Naziism, the Civil Rights Movement, etc.  He does  make tenuous tie-ins between these subjects and the main thrust of his  book, but the book would not have suffered if a lot of this material had  been edited out.<br />My overall reaction to Entine's book was that it was a  Master's Thesis gone awry.  By this I mean that there was enough material  for a Thesis but that it had been expanded with repetitious and extraneous  material that dulled the impact of its main theme.<br />To end with a  paraphrase of an old adage:  It's too bad that Entine didn't just throw out the bathwater.  I think the baby is worth keeping.	2000-05-24
