The first work of his I read was his last (unless, like the late Ludlum, his estate decides to keep him alive through badly written and truly \\"ghost\\" novels).<br /><br />  McBain wrote, I think, 55 87th Precinct police procedurals. \\"The Big Bad City\\" was published in 1999. Structurally, McBain seems to have found a forumula and stuck with it - and that's a good thing, because his forumula works.<br /><br />  In a city that stands in as a thinly veiled New York city, the 87th Precinct bustles with activity. The precinct's detectives juggle many cases at a time, some propelled by political pressure, others by the personal involvement of the detectives, some because of happenstance and lucky tips or breaks.<br /><br />  In \\"The Big Bad City,\\" a burglar dubbed The Cookie Boy by the press because he leaves chocolate cookies behind is on the loose;  the man who killed Detective Cardella's father decides to wrap up loose ends by killing the Detective is on the prowl and a woman is found strangled in the park. The latter case rises from the routine when the woman is discovered to be a young nun - with breast implants.<br /><br />  McBain is in flawless. His characters have enough depth to be believable; just enough depth. His police officers run the range from the competent to slovenly and not quite-as-competent. Some are fair-minded, some are bigots. They solve their crimes through good, tedious police work. They don't get miraculous breaks: just those that they develop through their own persistence , diligence, experience and hard-work, aided by the occasional walk-in or phone-in tip. McBain is terrific at describing this often boring, often discouraging work without himself becoming tedious.<br /><br />  The unravelling of the murder of the nun is great storytelling as is the story of the guy plotting to kill the cop. The burglar story is a delight that could easily stand alone as a short story.<br /><br />  I regret having discovred McBain after his death, but he left one hell of a legacy.<br /><br />Jerryiscovred McBain after his death, but he left one hell of a legacy. <br /> <br />Jerry	2005-10-11

Sure, I knew the name, but was never interested enough to see one of his movies. Now, after reading Jimmy McDonough's \\"Big Bosoms and Square Jaws,\\" I don't think I have to: McDonough's biography tells me all I need to know.<br /><br />  I wasn't familiar with Jimmy McDonough either before picking up this book. Now I am. McDonough writes like the late Hunter S. Thompson on one his better days. The prose is intensely personal, highly driven, with the feel of a first-person memoir. I suspect that if Russ Meyer weren't an egocentric, self-centered guy who made movies with bare breasts when it was considered \\"dirty,\\" the book still would have been interesting. McDonough is that good.<br /><br />  I still have no great desire to see a Meyer film. But the guy's story as told by McDonough is interesting. McDonough doesn't get into film criticism as an effete sport. Rather he delivers his opinion of Meyer's work, buttressed by reviews. His interviews with survivors of relationships with Meyer crackle. He's done a marvelous job of weaving other people's recollections (always properly attributed) into the narrative.<br /><br />  Meyer coems across as a guy who pursued his dreams. Personally he seems to have been a large ego who really didn't care a whole lot for or about other people. There is literally a cast of thousands of supporting players who played a role in making Meyer whatever he became. The women he used as his \\"stars\\" are treated beautifully and sensitively by McDonough. Many, if not all, were strippers. It would have been easy to depict them as airheads. Much to McDonough's credit, he doesn't. He treats them as human beings.<br /><br />  Meyer never really failed. He determined on what he was going to (worship the female breast, essentially, and make movies) and did it. Meyer will never be a nominee for a Nobel Prize and its likely that his work will fade from memory over time. McDonough, however, does an excellent job of describing Meyer's technique, his contributions to filmaking and his not inconsiderable role in broadening the accpeptability of all manner of \\"artistic expression\\" in the United States.<br /><br />  McDonough is very understated in his description of Meyer's decline. It would have been easy, I think, to have allowed a sense of outrage to show, but much to McDonough's credit, he holds himself in.<br /><br />  Overall, even if you have little or no interest in Russ Meyer or his films, this biography is worth reading simply to gain a sense of Jimmy McDonough.<br /><br />Jerryellent job of describing Meyer's technique, his contributions to filmaking and his not inconsiderable role in broadening the accpeptability of all manner of \\"artistic expression\\" in the United States. <br /> <br />  McDonough is very understated in his description of Meyer's decline.

Selwyn Raab is supposed to be an \\"expert\\" on the Mafia which, to my thinking, would also include an expertise on crime in general and its techniques and tools.<br /><br />  So why does Mr. Raab refer to an \\"automatic revolver\\" as a weapon? There is no such firearm. This is only one of dozens of such errors I noted through the middle of \\"Five Families\\" where I stopped counting. Raab is either a poor writer or had a poor editor or suffers from both. In another instance, Raab compares a female prosecutor to the actress-comedienne . . . without bothering to identify the object of his comparison. Sloppy editing? Poor writing? I don't know, but I suspect that no competent author, proud and sure of his product, would allow such mistakes go to print.<br /><br />  Raab's account of the Mafia adds nothing new to the already bulging public record. I am not a Mafia buff, though I have read a good deal about crime, the FBI and so on. Nothing Raab has to say in \\"Five Families\\" came as a new fact. I suspect Raab simply combed the archives pulling every bit together, attempted to polish it a bit by forcing it into a chronology, which often becomes confused, and called it a \\"history.\\" Overall, \\"Five Families\\" strikes me as a cut-and-paste assemblage.<br /><br />  It is in a way, but Raab does noting to make this history exciting or even interesting. Raab us far from joining Amrose or McCullough as a writer of popular history.<br /><br />  The writing style is, frankly, boring, stilted and certainly not what I would expect from a journalist claiming so many years experience.<br /><br />  There's simply nothing new or of compelling interest in \\"Five Families.\\" If, should you read it, everything looks familiar, that's because it is: you've read it all before somewhere else.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-10-05

John March, the former law enforcement officer turned private investigators, has more personal problems than the waiting room of a large, busy mental health clinic. A murdered wife. Recovering alcoholic. Unable to form friendships or significant relationships. A backstory can be used creatively. Think Rambo ot Barry Eisler's John Rain or Lee Child's Jack Reacher. Or going back, Shane or the Sheriff in \\"High Noon.\\"<br /><br />  In \\"Death's Little Helpers,\\" John March is simply unbelievable as are all the other characters. Fortunately Spiegelman writes well enough and keeps the action fast enough that March's cardboard character doesn't matter that much.<br /><br />  Worse are the cliches that Spiegelman uses to advance his story. March's distasteful client, Nina Sachs, terminates the job, finding her ex-husband who disappeared several weeks ago. No problem for March, who conveniently enough has a trust fund to sustain him as he continues the search for the missing man.<br /><br />  Spiegelman does a good job with the plot, adding one layer of intrigue after another. Many of the twists and turns are essentially unbelievable, but as I said, Spiegelman keeps thing moving quickly.<br /><br />  The most bothersome thing about Spiegelman's writing is his use of eating and drinking as a formula for moving things along. It feels like every other paragraph is devotee to March drinking coffee, cranberry juice and gingerale or whatever. Some of this is logical and fits with the story: meeting a contact at a diner, for example. But a lot of it is transparently just staging for characters to exchange a few words. Very formulaic.<br /><br />  Given all this, Spiegelman is a facile writer. While only average, \\"Death's Little Helper\\" is a moderately good, even enjoyable read. One can only hope that he gains greater mastery of his craft.<br /><br />Jerryy	2005-10-05

Deon Meyer's Zet van Heerden, a former police orficer turned failing private investigator, carries a backstory that would have a Freudian analyst turning cartwheels.<br /><br />  To Meyer's credit, he controls the backstory and although he comes close to overdoing it at several points, he does rein himself in time. It's a personal bias of mine, no doubt, but I think \\"Dead at Daybreak\\" would have been a better novel without spending so much time on van Heerden's psychological problems.<br /><br />  Even with that reservation, \\"Dead at Daybreak\\" is an engrossing mystery. Sprung from the local jail by attorney Kemp, who apparently holds van Heeren in low regard, he is deposited at the office of Hope Beneke, a young woman lawyer who has but seven days to recover a will that was stolen in a grisly execution style murder. If the will is not found, Wilna van As will collect nothing from the estate of the deceased, with who she has lived and worked for more than a decade.<br /><br />  Once a rising star in academic criminology, van Heerden leeft the academy and joined the police force. After the death of his partner and mentor, he embarked on a downward slide of alcohol and anger. His mother, a famous artist, is still there to lend him moral support.<br /><br />  Van Heerden is convinced that he is a failure and on several occasions comes to Beneke and quits. But each time he is pushed forward by a new idea. Seven days and they are passing quickly.<br /><br />  Van Heerden uses his network of old police and criminal contacts and the story of the murder begins to unravel as new threats to van Heerden, his mother, lawyer Beneke and others are introduced.<br /><br />  Meyer is  skillful writer. His plot is imaginative, sometimes coming close to straining credulity, but almost always staying within the boundaries that keep the reader interested.<br /><br />  At the end, a plot nearly a quarter of century old is revealed. The police, military intelligence, even the CIA have become involved. All together it adds up to a fascinating mystery.<br /><br />Jerry/> <br />  At the end, a plot nearly a quarter of century old is revealed.

The characters, good guys and bad, are wonderfully quirkly which adds to their believability even though most are only quickly sketched.<br /><br />  The plot is straightforward: a bad guy is hustling around town shooting people twice in the head with his Glock. A number of detectives, each admirably human in their virtues and vices, are drawn into the case. McBain doesn't depend on surprise twists and turns. Rather, the plot unveils itself as the result of disciplined investigation by the detectives who follow every lead.<br /><br />  The villain is well-developed by McBain. He is revealed layer by layer, as if an onion were being peeled. McBain is very deft with this technique.<br /><br />  With \\"Fiddlers,\\" I felt as if I were reading an extensive wrap-up that might have appeared in a good magazine. Really neat stuff. While I've discovered McBain late, he has left a legacy of more than 50 novels for me (and pwerhaps you) to catch up on.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-10-01

He's also had a few novels that were good, but far from great. \\"Creepers\\" falls into this latter category.<br /><br />  Morrell has wandered into the territory occupied by Dean Koontz, a universe of seemingly paranormal events.<br /><br />  In \\"Creepers\\" a group of \\"urban explorers\\" infiltrate an abandoned hotel built at the turn of the century by an eccentric recluse. The Paragon is slated for demolition and these people want to see it before it falls to the wrecker's ball. The group is led by Professor Conklin. With him are a group of young people and one stranger: Frank Balenger. Balenger quickly becomes the lead character and that is unfortunate.<br /><br />  As the group penetrates the hotel through a secret storm drain, Morrell attempts to set the stage with mutant rats and cats. He is, in short, setting up a haunted house.<br /><br />  The group of urban explorers is overpoweree by a group of urban rate, the two legged variety. Now it turns out that the Professor had an ulterior motive: locating a rumored treasure trove worth millions.<br /><br />  The story, in my opinion, goes rapidly downhill. The bad guys are really, really bad. Murderers, rapiss, thieves: comic book cariactures. Surprisingly nearly all of Morrell's characters in \\"Creepers\\" lack depth. They are mere sketches. The exceptions are Frank Belanger and his antagonist, \\"Ronnie.\\" Ronnie is the ultimate villain in the novel.<br /><br />  The problem is that both Belanger and Ronnie are simply unbelievable. Belanger's backstory is a series of extraordinary earlier events that simply don't work. They are pure invention intended to help the writer over the rough spots in his plot and they don't work. Ronnie is much the same. There is nothing believable.<br /><br />  The action is fine to an extent. Much of it is simply violent encounters that Morrell stretches to the limit.<br /><br />  Morrell is a very fine writer and it is his skill with words that renders \\"Creepers\\" a good read. The plot and characters in the hands of a lesser man would have resulted in a throwaway story. \\"Creepers\\" is a tolerable fast read, but it isn't on a par with the spine-tingling suspense of many of Morrell's other works.<br /><br />Jerryskill with words that renders \\"Creepers\\" a good read.

It is a political history of New York City, New York State and the forces Giuliani had to face and fight. As such, the book becomes a tribute to a remarkable, but far from perfect, man and a frightening portrait of an American city where corrupt poltiicians, addled academics, clueless socialists and race-baiters have gone mad and imprisoned honest, working people in a neo-Marxist nightmare.<br /><br />  Siegel provides a short history of New York City politics from the 1930s onward. I had no idea of just how far to the left the city was and how the government took so much from working people in order to support a huge (600,000!) cadre of those who wouldn't work and myriad social service \\"providers\\" catering to their imagined needs. Siegel provides facts, not opinions. If he has an axe to grind, he's done a superb job of keeping it hidden.<br /><br />  Giuliani, facing the reality of the fiscal devestation wreaked by his predecessors, attempts to bring the budget under control. Needless to say the entrenched bureaucracies, unions and interest groups fight him every step of the way, resorting to lies, ad hominems and even the threat of violence in the form of race riots if Giuliani doesn't retreat or compromise.<br /><br />  Siegel paints a portrait of Giuliani that predicted the man the nation and world became familiar with on and after 9/11. A strong man, secure in his beliefs; a man who was willing and able to stand alone. As it happens, Siegel reveals Giuliani as a skillful poltician who was able to weave a small alliance of forward thinking politicians, even those who were his political opposites, but who had the welfare of New York at heart.<br /><br />  The battles were monmumental, much greater than the national news reported. The corruption and stagnation of New York City is unbelievable. A Board of Education that consumed $11 billion annually, turned out graduates who couldn't read, but protected school custodians who mopped lunchrooms once a week. Principalships were sold. The number of employees was unknown. Corruption was rife. And this was only one of the problems Giuliani faced.<br /><br />  Al Sharpton and Charlie Rangel are portrayed as villains. Each reader, I am certain, will have their own opinion of these men. But their machinations are well covered in Siegel's book.<br /><br />  One of the most frightening chapters talks of how CUNY, once called the \\"poor man's Harvard\\" was dumbed down. CUNY's education college turned out most of the teachers for New York City's public schools. More than 50% of these teachers couldn't pass a simple exam. The academics then claimed that these failures were good teachers, but bad test takers --- and further dumbed down the test.  With its open admission policy and free tuition, CUNY graduated less than 1% of its 2 year degree students within two years. (Perhaps as a byproduct of CUNY's dumbing down, the editing and proofreading of this book is awful. Spelling and grammatical errors abound. Small factual details weren't checked: the Chicago Institute of Art is mentioned: it happens to be the Chicago Art Institute.)<br /><br />  Siegel recounts the political jockeying when the Democrats attempt to defeat Giuliani. New York City is a wonderland of bizarre political alliances.<br /><br />  Finally, Siegel covers the Rudy of 9/11 and the immediate post-Rudy period.<br /><br />  As political history, \\"The Prince of the City\\" is absolutely first-rate.

I have now read all six published works in no particular order. \\"Term Limits\\" was, I believe, Flynn's debut work. Having read it last provides, I think, an interesting perspective on Flynn's work.<br /><br />  Five of the six Flynn novels feature Mitch Rapp, a very skillful assasin. \\"Term Limits\\" doesn't have Mitch Rapp, but it does feature many of the characters found in his later novels.<br /><br />  Straight out of the box, Flynn gives a unique voice to the political thriller. In his Washington, the politicians are generally loathsome, self-serving creatures lacking basic integrity, morality and values. All they live for are their greed and swaggering egos.<br /><br />  The book opens with the murder of Senator Fitzgerald, an obese, alcoholic senator intent on projecting his own power even when, as in this case, it leads to the deaths of American solidiers.<br /><br />  Fitzgerald's neck is expertly broken in his home. Within hours two other equally corrupt politicians are murdered. The murderers issue a set of demands calling for the executive and legislative branches to acheive certain political goals. As in all Flynn novels, these goals resonate with ordinary Americans.<br /><br />  The CIA and FBI come into play to solve the crimes. But President Stevens' Chief of Staff and National Security Advisor don't necessarily want the murders solved. In fact, they think more murders would help President Stevens achieve re-election.<br /><br />  Michael O'Rourke, a first-term Congressman from Minnesota has alrady turned down the President's invitation to vote for his overblown, bloated budget. O'Rourke, a decent man, has an idea of who the assasins might be. A former Marine he recognizes the killing techniques as those American Special Forces might use.<br /><br />  Director Stansfield of the CIA and his assistant Irene Kennedy, head of counter terrorism efforts pursue the leads in conjunction with Director Roach of the FBI and Special Agent McMahon. All of these characters live on in Flynn's subsequent novels and I am glad they do.<br /><br />  The suspense is riveting. Is the President involved in the brutal murders of Senator Olson and a \\"clean polirtics\\" Representative? Will the White House succeed in its attempts to manipulate public opinion?<br /><br />  Flynn's Washington is a place of distrust, dishonor, duplicity, hypocrisy and murder. He is, in my opinion, the best crafter of political thrillers in the business today, putting Tom Clancy (except for \\"Red October\\") to shame.<br /><br />  In \\"Term Limits,\\" we see Flynn gathering his strength for later efforts. In all the other Flynn novels, the characters literally jump off the page. \\"Term Limits\\" has one minor character who doesn't quite have it. The political cynicism of Flynn's subsequent novels are sharply drawn: you can recognize many of the repulsive characters as being modeled on politicians whom we are all too familiar with from the daily news. In \\"Term Limits\\" only one politician, the alcoholic, self-interested, hypocritical, immoral Senator whose death opens the book triggers immediate recognition with its real prototype.<br /><br />  The plot is tight. Flynn simply doesn't require that his characters have fortuitous, unbelievable inventions to adcvance the story. His plots are simply exquisite. (One of my particular irritants are authors who use scenes involving food and drink as bridges to let the characters expound. Jack Higgins and Clive Cussler in their latest novels overuse these devices: Flynn simply doesn't need them.)<br /><br />  \\"Term Limits\\" is a true page-turner. I intended to spend an hour with it as bedtime reading --- and it kept me glued till dawm. What higher compliment can I pay to Vince Flynn? Oh yes, the same thing happened when I read his other five novels.<br /><br />Jerrye FBI and Special Agent McMahon.

But Cussler is also uneven and sometimes he turns out a dull book --- and \\"Polar Shift\\" is probably the dullest Cussler novel to date.<br /><br />  Cussler's plots are always at least somewhat far-fetched. But in a good Cussler adventure, this just adds to the pleasure in its own way. The story moves so fast that you automatically overlook the sudden plot jolts or the bits that are simply beyond the pale.<br /><br />  This time the entire plot is so overblown that there is no way to do that. Part of the reason is that the whole book is silly. The characters are flatter than any I've seen in a Cussler novel. The dialog is often simplistic to the point of absurdity. There is a heavy reliance on characters eating and drinking to set the scene and sometimes it is just silly: do we really care that Kurt Austin uses Kenyan coffee beans?<br /><br />  For a thriller, the action is not only sparse, but unbelievable. You can stretch an incredible escape from danger just so far before it becomes farce. Here, unintended farce occurs often, particularly at what should be the climax. The scene in which the bad guys meet their fate reads like an outline of what was intended.<br /><br />  As a Cussler fan, I know he can miss on occasion, but I've never seen him miss this badly and sincerely hope it doesn't happen again.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-09-22

Five in all, I think. I did not read them in the order they were written. Much to Flynn's credit, they don't have to be read in order. Each volume stands alone.<br /><br />  Mitch Rapp is an assassin, a part of the Orion Team, a clandestine effort known only to a few in the U.S. government. The President,a very few people at the CIA who povide covert assistance and a very few members of Congress. The purpose of the Orion Team is to bring the war on terror to the terrorists with surgical, fatal strikes. Mitch Rapp is the chosen instrument and he is very good at his job. But Mitch wants out. He has met and fallen in love with Anna Reilly, a television reporter.<br /><br />  This will be Rapp's last job, he thinks. The assasination of a German Count who has done business with Saddam once too often. The CIA has provided two helpers for the task. One of them tries to murder Rapp seconds after he has dispatched the German.<br /><br />(...)<br /><br />  The plot, as it is with all Flynn novels, is convoluted with double-crosses as common as snow in the mountains. When Flynn writes a political thriller, it is indeed political. He is hard on appeasers and obviously sees many politicians as self-serving and even traitorous.<br /><br />  Flynn's Mitch Rapp and all the other characters are richly drawn. They are all believable: good guys and bad guys alike. The suspense is tight on every page. And the body count grows with every page.<br /><br />  Flynn is, in my opinion, the absolute master of the political thriller. \\"The Third Option\\" is, again in my opinion, a masterpiece of the genre.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-09-22

What counts is Guilfoile's skill: he knows how to write a short story, a demanding form that all the other authors in this collection, including the editor/author seem to be unfamiliar with.<br /><br />  Aside from \\"Zero Zero Day,\\" the other 17 stories range from merely boring to truly awful. One of the worst is \\"All Happy Families\\" by Andrew Ervin. This is a sophmoric attempt to mix Joycean stream of conciousness, bank robbery, failed romance and baseball into something or other. A young bank robber is riding the train (as in AMTRAK) back from a college town where he has just robbed a bank to Chicago's Union Station. The attempt to mix  these themes results in a display of pretentiously \\"intellectual\\" nonsense. One of those things that no one understands, but people will claim to find meaning in so they don't appear embarassed to their equally clueless friends who also extract deep, hidden meaning from utter nonsense. Thus are \\"artists\\" born in our culure.<br /><br />  Anyone familiar with the short story from its golden age in America, the 1930s - 1950s will recognize that the authors here are, for the most part, pretenders. Contrary to the back cover blurb that \\"It's the Chicago that the Department of Tourism doesn't want you to see . . . \\", none of the stories are uniquely Chicagoan. They could take place in any large city and in most smaller cities as well. Most of the stories are self-concious in their styles: the writers are preening, showing off.<br /><br />  Much of this may have to do with the editor, Neal Pollock, who claims to have been a \\"reporter\\" with the Chicago Weekly Reader for several years. The Reader is a so-called alternative newsweekly. This means its editorial content of anti-American, anti-capitalist, ant-establishment, anti-everything is sandwiched inside a wrapper of advertising. The Reader, by my estimation, carries about 12 pages of advertising for each page of editorial, a ratio most legitimate, traditional newspapers wouldn't dare. But the Reader caters to an audience that pretends to be something other than what they are: urban up and comers going through their \\"independent adult\\" period before they marry and head off to the suburbs.<br /><br />  In any event, with the exception of the Guilfoile story, this collection is both a bust and an insult to the short story form.<br /><br />Jerryanti-everything is sandwiched inside a wrapper of advertising.

As police procedurals go, it's average. The most striking aspect of the novel to me is that everyone is certifiably dysfunctional. Recovering alcoholics, survivors of childhood sexual abuse, people whose significant others have committed suicide and so on. The oddity is that none of these afflictions add anything to the character and, for the most part, are soon forgotten.<br /><br />  Jonas Piedmont Beaumont is a homicide detective, recently transferred from the Seattle Police Department to the Washington State Attorney's Special Homicide Investigation Team. (The author's alleged wit, I suppose, derives from the acronym of the last four words.)<br /><br />  A nun has recovered memories of witnessing a murder when she was five years old and through clout gets the case brought to the attention of the team. Beaumont immediately runs into roadblocks established by Seattle PD Captain Kramer. But fear not, Beaumont perseveres and connects the murder to locally prominent family.<br /><br />  But, oh my, Beaumont's disabled friend has a bit of problem as well. The ex-wife of Ron Peters, Beaumont's former partner, is murdered and Ron is the prime suspect. Beaumont is told not to get involved in a case centered on a police officer. But, of course, he ignores that and proceeds to investigate on his own.<br /><br />  Peters' sister-in-law lives in the household along with the wife, two teenaged daughters and a young son. Uh huh, the household is a tad dysfunctional. Heather, the younger girl is dating Dillon. Dillon has a bit of a Faulknerian surprise to offer later in the book.<br /><br />  Overall, the novel plods along. Beaumont has little depth. The other characters have even less. What are supposed to be twists and turns in the plot are more like a well-travelled road straight across the prairie.<br /><br />  Not a terrible book, but definitely not a page-turner.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-09-18

His main character, Frank Corso, is a \\"rogue reporter, successful true crime writer and honorable loner with a dangerous edge.\\" Actually Corso doesn't have a whole lot of depth as a character, but his quirkiness kind of makes up for that. He's one of those guys who more or less stumbles into trouble and then spends a few hundred pages getting out of it . . . usually running into a lot more trouble on the way. Lee Child's Jack Reacher is the epitome of such characters and Ford's Corso doesn't come close, but is still enjoyable.<br /><br />  Here Corso is stuck at O'Hare Airport desperate to be on his way to someplace remote where he won't be found and arrested. Texas is seeking his arrest as a material witness: Corso, it seems, claimed to have some information that he really didn't have. A thin premise, but enough to move on.<br /><br />  He's tricked a former lover / current friend into coming with him. Now they to get out and get out quick. A static weather front has closed O'Hare with heavy snow. So Corso and friend rent a car and take off to Milwaukee. The first of Ford's many inaccuracies soon appear: he has Corso driving more than a hundred miles north and still in Illinos. Cant happen. There are a lot of laughs like this in Ford's book, least among them descriptions of harrowing mountain roads in Wisconsin. Wisconsin has nothing that could be considered a mountain. Such mistakes don't detract from the story, but do add touches of unintended humor.<br /><br />  Anyway, the snows soon make driving impossible as does a turned over pickup truck in the road. Corso's vehicle hits it and slides down a slope (fat chance in Wisconsin). Corso's girlfriend rescues him by dragging him into an abandoned homestead. She salvages wood from an outlying building. When Corso recovers conciousness, he goes out to the building for more wood and - surprise - discovers a neatly wrapped package containing three bodies.<br /><br />  Thus begins the adventure. Rescued from the snow by a snow removal driver, a small-town sherriff makes a deal with Corso. If he promises to clear up this embarassing murder, she will bluff the two Texas Marshalls who have shown up to take Corso to the slammer.<br /><br />  The search is on for a mysterious woman who showed up in this small Wisconsin town (which is difficult to believe exists in Wisconsin), has sex with practically everyone and then suddenly settles down with a homely, reclusive farmer. The trail leads to the mountainfolk of New Jersey and New York. (Bet you didn't know, according to Ford, that these two states have their own strain of truly inbred \\"hillbillies.\\")<br /><br />  The factual basis may be weak, but the story is good.

The plot is superb. The characters live and breathe.<br /><br />  Wyatt Gillette is serving a three year sentence in a federal penitentary for computer hacking. He receives a visit from \\"Andy\\" Anderson, chief of the California State Police Computer Crimes Unit. The deal: a very temporary release from prison if Gillete will help the police track down a murderer. The murderer is another computer hacker.<br /><br />  It turns out that Gillette and Phate, the other hacker, have a long, involved history. Phate has entered the \\"Blue Nowhere,\\" a term coined by Gillette, to describe the machine (computer) universe where there are no secrets and anybody can be anyone.<br /><br />  Phate has gone off the deep end: he is playing out a computer game in the real world. The game, \\"Access\\", is deadly. The idea is to get close to protected targets and kill them. Phate is now marking living humans for death, preferably by wriggling a knife into their heart. He gains access to his potential victims through their compters, by loading a devilish Trojan he's written, known as Trapdoor.<br /><br />  Readers very familiar with computer technology will spot Deaver's minor errors, one misspelling in particular and some liberties he took with the technology, circa 2001. But, frankly, these mistakes take absolutely nothing away from Deaver's story.<br /><br />  The plot is filled with false leads, anti-climaxes and a number of true surprises.<br /><br />  Phate is a madman using the technology to murder. He is aided by a very mysterious accomplice, Shawn, who helps him stay one step ahead of the police.<br /><br />  Gillette is a dedicated hacker, fascinated by the technology and the Blue Nowhere. But he has paid a steep price. Imprisonment. The loss of his beloved wife. His past with Phate, when they both belonged to the same hacking group, marks him for death.<br /><br />  Deaver is a masterful storyteller. Those not deeply involved with the technology will find this to be a first-rate thriller. And those who are familiar with the technology will be even more satisfied.<br /><br />Jerryfor death. <br /> <br />  Deaver is a masterful storyteller.

I gave up entirely at page 47. Within these few pages the authors establish themselves as celebrities trading on their fame, not their ability to write passable fiction.<br /><br />  One of the two primary characters, Philomena \\"Manny\\" Manfreda, \\"a crusading attorney for the disenfranchised\\" is as believable as a three-dollar bill. \\"Only five years out of law school, with an apartment not much bigger than one of her Prada show boes and a burgeoning reputation as one of the city's fiercest litigators . . .\\" raves the dustjacket, a theme further described in the first 19 pages.<br /><br />  However, Manny Manfreda is portrayed as one of the most incompetent litigators ever seen in print. The story opens with Manny rushing to federal court. Of course, Manny's court wardrobe must be described with a catalog of famous names: just the kind of clothes one would wear to impress a jury determining whether the \\"establishment\\" had wronged the \\"underdog\\" - or if a money-grubbing attorney were simply picking someone's deep pockets. (A federal marshall suggests she not wear her \\"Italian designer black-on-black fabric-embroidered d'Orsay pumps\\" with the metal in the heels, so she stop setting off the courthouse security system. Manny, of course, is running late for court when she is once again pulled aside for special screening because of her shoes. Gotta admit: this Manny is one smart cookie, reminding me of Paris Hilton.)<br /><br />  Manny is cross-examining an expert witness, the famous pathologist, Jake Rosen. (Of course, let's not forget for a single moment, that authors Linda Kenney and Michael Baden are, respectively, a civil rights lawyer and patholigist and both television celebrities.)<br /><br />  In four pages of what is supposed to be a riveting cross-examination, Manny (and the authors) reveal themselves as poseurs in the world of fiction and contemptuous of the intelligence of their readers.<br /><br />  Anyone even barely familiar with the civil litigation process will recognize that Manny is a total incompetent: she is cross-examining an expert witness in a civil trial without having deposed him. In civil litigation, an expert witness may be deposed before trial about their opinions. This is done to prevent exactly the kind of surprises the bumbling Manny encounters in court. The expert reveals information about the alleged victim of police brutality that Manny has never seen or heard before. This means Manny did not read the expert's report which must contain all of the expert's opinions. It also means that Manny did not depose the expert prior to trial, something impossible to believe (in real life).<br /><br />  Manny is not only unbelievably incompetent, she's a walking target for malpractice. In short, Manny is not only utterly fictional, but even as fiction she is unbelievable.<br /><br />  Linda Kenney, if her dustjacket biography is at all factual, must know this. That she ignores it is not because of any kind of fictional license: rather it is a blatant insult to her readers.<br /><br />  Some readers may be able to move beyond this portrayal of the well-dressed \\"fierce\\" litigator who doesn't seem to have a clue about trial procedure. I can't. For me, fictional characters must be believable. Clancy's Jack Ryan, for instance, is believable. Grisham's lawyers are often believable.<br /><br />  Baden and Kenney's Manny Manfreda is simply nonsensical.<br /><br />  There's a lot more wrong in the 47 pages I read: this is simply the absolute worst of it. This is clearly a novel published because its authors are celebrities: they and their publishers think their names alone will sell a bad story. Hopefully the reading public will prove them wrong --- as wrong as Manny Manfreda's courtroom practice.<br /><br />Jerryeir readers.

Bernard Goldberg's \\"Bias\\" and \\"Arrogance\\" were exposes of bias in the media. This time around Goldberg offers his opinion of 100 people he --- and the emphasis must be on the fact that he clearly labels it as entirely personal opinion --- are screwing up America.<br /><br />  As an opinion piece, it lacks the power of his previous books, but it remains an interesting read. Goldberg is non-sectarian in his choices: mindless conservatives are skewered along with mindless leftists. More leftists catch it from Goldberg than conservatives, but I'm not going to comment on the man's catechism: they are his choices.<br /><br />  The vignettes Goldberg paints of each of his targets are concise. He doesn't need to engage in lengthy polemics: Goldberg wields a sharp scalpel. Not all of his targets are well known to the general public and in that Goldberg provides a public service by stripping the cloak of obscurity from some people like Jonathan Kozol, whose philosophy is ruining the minds of children.<br /><br />  Overall a very informative read. Goldberg invites readers to submit their own nominees for his list and I think this is a good idea.

In \\"Without Mercy,\\" Higgins has hit bottom. Each of the 311 pages is tepid, if not downright silly. Sean Dillon is no longer a character, but simply a bunch of words. I don't recall ever seeing so many references to liquor in a Higgins novel. Virtually every scene has one or more of the characters having a drink or two or three.<br /><br />  The plot is just plain dumb. Very poor editing does nothing to improve it. Simply put, Hannah Bernstein, a continuing character, is wounded in and is then murdered while recovering in a hospital. One would think seurity would be provided for a member of a highly secret intelligence unit laying semi-comatose in a hospital. Nope. Of course the novel is filled with such nonsense.

Sure.<br /><br />  Major Roper, the so-called computer genius amazes - with information that can be obtained from any search engine. Alternatively, absolutely no secret is safe from Roper. Entirely unbelievable.<br /><br />  In all, the plot, such as it is, is one flimsy device after another. There simply is nothing believable, nothing that evokes tension.

The diligent researcher can find methodologically sound statistics on practially every aspect of life.<br /><br />  The rub, of course, comes in the interpreta tion of those statistics. In \\"Cities Ranked & Rated,\\" compilers/authors Sperling and Sander attempt to, well, rank and rate cities on \\"what places are best and why.\\" The results are hilarious.<br /><br />  Political correctness pervades the effort. Wal-Mart, the target of many special interest groups, is lambasted for depriving small towns of \\"individualized service and wide selection.\\" I'm familiar with a number of small towns ranging in size from a few thousand to up to 25 thousand residents. And I knew those towns before Wal-Mart existed. What value if individualized service when buying a gallon of milk? The idea of \\"wide selection\\" in the retailers hosted by small towns is laughable. Sears Roebuck and Montgomery Ward brought true wide selection - and low prices - to small towns long before Wal-Mart existed. It was in fact the lack of selection and high prices in small towns that made Wal-Mart prosper in the first place.<br /><br />  Starbucks, on the other hand, is considered \\"sophisticated\\" by the elitists. Thus, the authors include the number of Starbucks stores in an area as \\"indicative of the quality of retail establishments.\\"<br /><br />  So let's see: a Wal-Mart is evil and contrbutes to urban sprawl. A Starbucks which is often located in the same shopping area as a Wal-Mart is a harbinger of a pleasant life. The authors don't seem to grasp the irony.<br /><br />  The compilation is loaded with such howlers. The use of crime statistics, for instance, which are stated as the rate of incidence per 100,000 people are particularly misleading since in most urban areas, crimes are concentrated in relatively small areas. The authors fail to point this out and give the false impression that entire areas are more dangerous than they actually are. To do otherwise would be politically incorrect. One of my favorite laugh-inducers is the inclusion of a \\"Diversity measure,\\" a calculation derived from the \\"Ethnic Composition\\" of the area. The higher the \\"Diversity measure,\\" the higher the ranking of the area. The fact that the areas with the highest \\"Diversity measures\\" also have the highest crime rates doesn't seem to faze the authors. Perhaps it would be fun to see how the number of Starbucks correllates with this.<br /><br />  Overall, various factors are unevenly weighed. For example, \\"earthquake risk\\" is listed as a negative for Anchorage, Alaska. New Orleans, which at the time of this writing is suffering from the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, does not rate a negative because it is largely below sea level and subject to flooding fromm hurricanes and other causes. The authors do mention this in passing, but do not raise it to the level of one of their \\"con\\" factors.<br /><br />  I certainly wouldn't rely on this volume to choose a place to live. On the more practical side, it is entertaining and does contain a great deal of information about 400 or so metropolitan areas The Statistical Abstract of the United States is probably a more reliable, but less entertaining source.

The best we can do is try to follow the paths backwards and forwards from today's languages to yesterday's and back again. Therein is Deutscher's genius. He makes no real attempt to define the beginning of language, since that can't be done, but he does take us on a tour of thousands of years of written and spoken language. It is, frankly, amazing to see the persistence of languages written several millennia ago in certain words while words from only a few centuries ago have totally different meanings today.<br /><br />  Deutshcer's writing style is \\"breezy\\" in a way as he attempts to make a very complext subject accessible to the non-expert. Still, the book is a moderately difficult read. Never boring, never slow: just difficult at times, particularly when Deutscher's attempts to explain things in a pseudo-language.

This is my third Mitch Rapp novel and my conclusion is that Vince Flynn is the leader of the pack when it comes to political thrillers. He has no close competition.<br /><br />  Mitch Rapp is a member of the Orion Team, a super-secret group with deniable connections to the CIA, White House and Congress. It's purpose is to eliminate terrorist threats to the United States without regard for anything but the danger they represent. Mitch Rapp is an \\"ordinary\\" guy, dedicated to extinguishing the terrorist threat without the messiness or hindrance of law. Find 'em, kill 'em and move on to the next one. Rapp is without a doubt the coolest super-hero to come down the pike in a long time. He has the freshness of the first incarnation of Clancy's Jack Ryan, the inventiveness of Clive Cussler's heroes and the philosophical bent of Barry Eisler's John Rain, who is the closest to Flynn's Mitch Rapp.<br /><br />  Flynn's take on politicians is devestating. He beautifully skewers the Democrats and their \\"peace at any price\\" acolytes. He sets up Robert Hayes as a \\"centrist\\" Democratic President. Hayes resembles no Democratic President of the past century. He is a reasonable, intelligent man without a radical political agenda. Surrounding him, however, are the products of Flynn's literary - and I do mean literary - genius. Venal, greedy, ignorant men and women of his party who put their own selfish interests far ahead of the nation; people who would prefer to live under the heel of the enemies of freedom rather than resist.<br /><br />  In \\"Transfer of Power,\\" the chair of the Democratic National Committee has accepted a $500,000 \\"donation\\" in return for arranging a last-minute meeting between the donor, supposedly a Prince of Oman, and the President. President Hayes' chief of staff doesn't bother with the Secret Service security rules. After all, it is a donation of $500,000.<br /><br />  As the \\"Prince\\" is about to murder the President in the Oval Office, the Secret Service receives a call from Mitch Rapp who has just abducted a top Hezbollah leader in Iran. Under intensive interrogation, Rapp has learned that the White House is to be the target of a terrorist attack this very day. The President is saved for the moment with only seconds to spare. The \\"Prince,\\" really a ruthless terrorist Rapp has been tracking for years, then proceeds to take over the White House. The attack relies heavily on information gleaned from another Democrat.<br /><br />  Almost a hundred hostages are taken. The Vice President assumes exeuctive power while the President is trapped incommuicado in a White House bunker. The White House is in control of the terrorists, its perimeter ringed with explosives. The terrorist leader makes a demand: release the Iranian billions siezed during the Carter-era hostage crisis or he will murder one hostage per hour. Transfer the money and he will let some hostages go.<br /><br />  The Vice President, a cowardly, but ambitious politician, takes counsel of his Attorney General, a woman with a preference for appeasement.<br /><br />  Quickly the situation deteriorates. Mitch Rapp is asked to get into the White House to reconnoiter. He does this with the help of Milt Adams, a retired Secret Service agent who knows more about the design of the White House then any living person. Rapp takes Adams with him, an unlikely, but ultimately highly effective pairing.<br /><br />  Flynn's plotting is an absolute delight. Everything flows smoothly from one tense moment to another. His characters are totally believable. Some, especially the weasly politicians, strongly resemble people we all have read about or seen on television. Rapp, the ordinary guy as super-hero, is exquisitely crafted and totally believable. The military personnel, the CIA directors, the Chiefs of Staff, the terrorists - every character is sharply drawn.<br /><br />  Much to his credit, Flynn manages to introduce a \\"romantic\\" element into this novel.

For example, at p. 298, Evans refers to Charles Lindbergh's \\"flirtation with the Nazis.\\" It was far more than a flirtation. Lindbergh often fulminated against the Jews, worked hand in hand with Nazi propagandists and received high decorations from the Nazi government. Likewise Evans invents or at least supports some very arguable assertions about Gary Kildall, an early innovator of personal computer operating systems.<br /><br />  The text is also marred by occasional concessions to political correctness which distort the underlying history or waste space on innovators who are not necessarily worthy of the covetrage they receive. For example, in the chapter on Samuel Colt, there is a concession to the anti-gun lobby which is totally outrageous and false.<br /><br />  None of these criticisms however is sufficient to take away from Evans' achievement. Warts and all, it is a well-done history of American innovation. It is a reminder of America's unique greatness in terms of allowing self-taught inventors to bring their products and services to market. And this volume can serve as an inspiration to children, a practical illustration of the social flexibility that makes the United States great.<br /><br />  The errors and biases are unfortunate, but not fatal. It would be nice if the author or publisher would establish a web site where these weaknesses could be corrected, but that is unlikely.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-09-06

He's a dedicated federal government employee charged with fighting terrorism in the top-secret Orion unit. Rules and laws are to be tossed aside when Rapp fights terrorism: results, the extinction of the threat and the enemy are all that counts.<br /><br />  Flynn's Mitch Rapp is a delight. In \\"Executive Power,\\" a shadowy Palestinian is determined to cause world-shaking changes. A man of many names, \\"David\\" has enlisted the sponsorship of a fabulously wealthy Saudi prince to move his sinister plans ahead. But David also works with Israeli intelligence, Palestinian terrorists and anyone else who will help advance his cause. David is a reuluctant murderer, but murder he does on a global scale. Hebron, New York, Washington all have corpses littering their street.<br /><br />  Rapp spends much of the novel avenging the deaths of two U.S. Navy SEALS who were betrayed by an errant State Department employee, an ambassador and corrupt Filipino general. Flynn writes great action scenes. Rapp, ever the sensitive assassin, is in the thick of the action, troubled only later by concerns of his new wife. Yes, Rapp is a married man.<br /><br />  Only compartively late in the novel do the machinations of David the reluctant murderer and Rapp, the thoughtful assassin, intertwine - and at that point David becomes prey to Rapp. If, of course, Rapp can acheive small wonders, such as identifying David and then finding him.<br /><br />  Flynn is a master at building suspense. His plots are tightly woven and although they depend on a great deal of fortuitous coincidences, they work. Rapp is definitely a super-hero, but not a bombastic one. He is the kind of person we all sincerely hope exists in the U.S. government, protecting us from the nation's enemies.<br /><br />  Great, fun reading for the lover of thrillers.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-09-05

He is intelligent, a skilled assassin, a caring husband and a guy who doesn't care about rules or laws when the nation's security is involved. Mitch Rapp is a super-hero, pure and simple.<br /><br />  Word reaches the top-secret Orion group that terrorists are smuggling a nuclear weapon into the United States, most likely in order to devestate Washington D.C. on Memorial Day. The story becomes far more complex and Flynn is a master at creating an edge-of-your-seat tension.<br /><br />  Flynn's plots are rich, his characters deeply drawn. You can't help but hate the bad guys and root for the good guys. The action is non-stop. Mitch Rapp, intelligent and philosophical as he is, doesn't think twice about killing or incapacitating the enemies of the nation. And he isn't a nice guy when he is interrogating a suspect. No wishy-washy Miranda warnings for Mitch Rapp. No lawyer's conference's about what is permitted. Rapp goes for the jugular: literally when needed.<br /><br />  Flynn appears to be an unabashed American patriot - and his creation, Mitch Rapp, bears this out in page after page of solid action. It's difficult to read the last page of Mitch Rapp novel without hoping that ficitional characters like him have their real-life equivalents. The nation and the world needs them.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-09-05

Timothy Driver was once a Navy SEAL and the Captain of a Trident missile submarine. He came home unexpectedly and found his wife in bed with another man. Capt. Driver dispatched both wife and her lover to the great beyond. As a result (and somewhat unbelievably as the result of a crime of passion), Driver is sentenced to life in prison without parole. Anything but a model prisoner, Driver causes a major optical problem (blindness by puncture wounds) for another prisoner to whom he had been \\"sold\\" as a sex slave.<br /><br />  Driver becomes a a guest of the Meza Azul prison in Arizona, which is run by a private corporation. Within short order, Driver compromises the high-tech facility and takes over the prison. He promise to execute one guard every six hours unless Frank Corso, who wrote a book about Driver, is delivered to the prison.<br /><br />  Uh huh, Ford's plot and character development would, under normal circumstances, leave a lot to be desired. But happily Ford's idea of plot is a hyper-kinetic, utterly unpredictable series of events that would serve as a model for chaos theory. One by one, seemingly unrelated events come together to produce unintended and unexpected consequences, much to the delight of the reader.<br /><br />  Corso is actually a near-minor player in the novel, which is a plus. He's just sort of there, sometimes the victim of events, sometimes the beneficiary. Driver is a man on a mission who, incidentally, is a cunning operator. Corso is important to him for reasons that are not clear until well into the book.<br /><br />  Overall, a delightful read and a fine thriller. Thin plot, thin characters, but in Ford's hands, neither is a consideration. The man simply knows how to tell a hold-on-to-your-seat story.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-09-04

He is a complex man, occasionally haunted by the past, sometimes sustained by it. A man with no friends, but a man who yearns to be close to people.<br /><br />  Above all, Rain is death. He thinks nothing of dispatching a person he senses as dangerous to him. And Eisler gives those scenes of termination a beautiful, slow-motion quality.<br /><br />  In \\"Rain Fall,\\" Rain has been assigned to dispatch Yasuhiro Kawamura, a government funtionary. Rain doesn't know why the man has to die; only that it must appear as if it were a natural death. Kawamura meets his maker on a Tokyo commuter train through ingenious means.<br /><br />  Under Eisler's deft hand, the plot quickly thickens. Beautifully done, Rain is led to Kawamura's daughter, Midori, an accomplished jazz pianist. Rain is quickly taken with Midori though the fact that he recently murdered her father creates a small complication or two.<br /><br />  Japanese poltiics, a dogged investigator, a computer geek and various toughs and corrupt politicians come into play as the story progresses (and the body count mounts).<br /><br />  Eisler's John Rain is wonderfully constructed. He is as real as the distinctive stranger next to you on the bus or at the airport. His plots are painstakingly wrought; no surprises that leave you saying \\"Impossible!; just the steady progression of events as Rain brings his considerable intellect to bear - and deals with the consequences of the unexpected.<br /><br />  John Rain is one of the best contemporary fiction heros I know of. (The other is Lee Child's Jack Reacher.) Noir, complex, intelligent, brooding, deadly. Simply put, any novel with John Rain is a must-read for the thriller lover.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-08-21

Too much.<br /><br />  The basic story concerns Fintan Dunne, a former NYPD homicide detective forced out by corrupt leaders. Now a private detective specializing in divorce, he loses a client the hard way: an angry wife who retained Dunne murders the philandering husband. Enter Elba Cordova who seeks Dunne's help in saving the soon to be executed Walter Grillo. He's innocent, she claims, of a brutal rape-murder.<br /><br />  Dunne unwillingly becomes involved. A parallel story begins in Germany where, in 1938, the Germans are girding to take over the world. Of course, the world must be purged of the mental defectives so the Aryan race may be pure. Enter Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, head of the German military intelligence service, Abwehr.<br /><br />  The story shoots off in a dozen different directions. German military concerns about and plots against Hitler. Dunne's relationship with New York's yellow journalists. The American Bund. The comers on the American political scene such as John Foster Dulles (who would be Secretary of State 15 years later), Tom Dewey, a racket busting prosecutor who was already a Presential hopeful. A not well executed portrait of an imaginary Britisher who might be a spy or a journalist or both who is trying to save the world. Eugenicists (thought Margaret Sanger and Planned Parernthood are not mentioned) who will make the world a better place by eliminating the physicially and mentally handicapped.<br /><br />  Not done yet. There's the prostitute with the heart of gold who sends Elba Cordova to see Dunne in the first place - and she has more than one story to hide. Corrupt cops. J. Edgar Hoover's G-Men. And many, many more.<br /><br />  The problem is that Quinn has over-populated his novel with characters, none of whom are well drawn and few of whom are necessary. The link between the Germans intent upon killing what the consider \\"life unworthy of living\\" is tenuous and provides a very weak vehicle for Quinn's story.<br /><br />  The influence of 40s noir mysteries and more contemporary efforts such as \\"The DaVinci Code\\" are easily recognized in Quinn's work.

These are, after all, average people telling about their lives. They have, unlike some politicians or controversial people, no secrets to hide.<br /><br />  Katherine Skiba comes across as a competent journalist who sort of went to war and was deeply impressed by the process and her experiences. I say \\"sort of went to war\\" because she really didn't face the enemy in combat. The only direct threat from enemy action may have been an Iraqi missile headed in the general direction of her camp at that time. This quibble is not intended as a criticism of Skiba because in another sense, she did go to war. She went to a short training camp for embedded journalists and then went through the same experiences every other soldier, sailor and airman went through. They left their families, the familiarities of their home life and went off thousands of miles to possibly fight a war.<br /><br />  These experiences clearly impacted Skiba. She records in great detail the flow of life in a series of temporary camps leading to the invasion of Iraq. All of her visions are sharp, sometimes augmented by memories of her father who had been a soldier in WWII.<br /><br />  Much to her credit, Skiba didn't bring any political bias to her memoir. She is at one with the troops around her, though she didn't personally like everyone around her which leads to part of my ambivalence about Skiba. Skiba is clearly a firm believer in the old cliche that you should never pick a fight with someone who buys ink by the barrel. She hammers several military people she dislikes over and over again because in one way or another they offended her. My reaction as a reader is that Skiba is intolerant, petty and very, very vindicative. One officer in particular is a repeated target of Skiba's skewering. She ultimately justifies her attacks by claiming virtually everyone else hated this officer as well, which could very well be true. But my impression is that Skiba is doing her best to ruin this man's reputation which might be fair if he had the ability to respond in kind. But like so many crucified by the media, he doesn't.<br /><br />  To Skiba's credit, she does include her impressions of the ordinary men and women who went to war. Her short portraits in her memoir are not the features she wrote for her paper. In fact, I regretted that her dispatches were not included in the book. Even in abbreviated form, Skiba's respect for these soldiers is clear - and admirable. Skiba clearly and justifiably holds herself above the talking heads and others who \\"report\\" on the war from the comfort of their air-conditioned New York studios or worse yet, the phonies who filed their dispatches from the Kuwaiti Hilton. Skiba's professional jealousy shows when she talks about turning her back on Geraldo Rivera's visit. Anyone who has ever watched \\"journalist\\" Geraldo Rivera can agree with the sentiment. On the other hand, Skiba is apparently easily awed by other journalists. It's an interesting and perhaps puzzling mix.<br /><br />  My overall impression is that Katherine Skiba is very proud of herself for leaving familiar surroundings, her husband and dog to  trek off into the uncertainties of war. Through no fault of her own, she is no Ernie Pyle: she wasn't assigned to a unit that had a high probability of seeing intense combat over a protracted period and she declined opportunities to directly expose herself to combat. By the same measure, Skiba does not pretend to be anything but she is: a 46 year old woman in the middle of the desert with thousands of men and women in uniform. She shares their considerable discomforts, the boredom and the fear of missile, gas and chemical attacks. She records, sometimes in boring detail, the small events of day to day life.<br /><br />  Overall, Skiba has produced an interesting memoir and my impression of her is favorable, though I think she tends toward self-aggrandizement. The key thing to remember is that this is a memoir, not truly a war story. Taken as a memoir of a working journalist, it is a worthwhile read.<br /><br />Jerryruly a war story.

Of the four John Rain thrillers to date (August, 2005), this is the deepest in terms of Rain's endless self-examination. Rain is a complex figure: a seeming nihilist who constantly questions the purpose of his existence. He kills effortlessly - and brilliantly. His specialty is assasination where death appears to be of natural origin.<br /><br />  Rain, product of an American mother and Japanese father is neither Japanese nor American in his own eyes. He doesn't fit; he has never fit.<br /><br />  Fleeing from Tokyo after a complex assignment, Rain is hoping to simply disappear and retire from the business of murder. But a contact in the Japanese equivalent of the FBI, himself a shadowy figure, asks Rain to take on one more project: the assisination of someone who may be a fixer for corrupt Japanese politicians. Rain's planning of this \\"natural death\\" is typical of Eisler's brilliant style. Meticulous and ingenious in every detail, Rain kills the bad guy in an inventive manner.<br /><br />  But before Rain can flee, his contact asks one more favor. This contact, incidentally, can sentence Rain to death by simply not protecting information about him. Rain however thinks of the man as being as close to a friend as anyone in his life.<br /><br />  Rain is not alone. He has a small set of acquaintances to whom he entrusts certain tasks, such as Harry the hacker. Those these characters are really only plot devices, Eisler does a great job of investing them with their own personalities. Rain is also, as you might expect, strongly attractive to women. Of course the last thing Rain wants is a romantic relationship which causes him to constantly question why he doesn't become involved in exactly that kind of relationship.<br /><br />  Women figure heavily in Rain's next assignment: talking out a stone-cold, sadistic killer for Japanese criminal and political interests. The suddenly acquired girlfriend of Rain's hacker friend, Harry, becomes an object of Rain's interest. The woman seems unlikely to be attracted to a nerd like Harry and when Rain learns she works at a club, his fears increase - especially so when Rain learns that his newest target owns the club. Rain's pursuit of the bad guy reverse soon enough and Rain becomes the hunted. The attack/retreat theme is superbly worked by Eisler.<br /><br />  The action in any John Rain story is non-stop. So is the tension. Eisler weaves very, very tight plots. Every character is beautifully (and lovingly) developed. \\"Hard Rain,\\" in particular, is extremely well constructed. Each page crackles with action.<br /><br />  Along with Jack Reacher (of Lee Child novels), John Rain is my favorite contemporary hero. Intelligent, self-directed, more often than not morose, these characters would have been anti-heros in another era, but in today's climate, they are heroic. I wish Barry Eisler wrote faster so there would be another John Rain thriller to enjoy sooner.<br /><br />Jerryiend of Rain's hacker friend, Harry, becomes an object of Rain's interest.

Upper crust or dirt poor, everyone has a story in Burke's novels and few, if any, of them are entirely pleasant.<br /><br />  The story begins with a memory of adolescence when a teenaged Dave Robicheaux and his brother are saved by a young prostitute in Galveston. Brother Jimmie falls hard and is going to rescue her from her pimp, but that doesn't work out and the woman disappears, presumed dead.<br /><br />  Flash-forward a couple of decades and Robicheaux is reminded of Ida Durbin, the hooker from so many years before when Troy Bordelon is checking into the great beyond. Bordelon has something resembling a deathbed confession of being at a rural cabin where Ida was taken. He had seen blood.<br /><br />  Robicheaux takes of the scent which leads him into the underworld of not-quite-rural Louisiana and its population of refugees from Tennessee Williams and Faulkner. Oh, by the way, there's a brutal serial murderer running around, a rich family that owns local law enforcement, has ties to the New Orleans mafia. Did I mention white slaving and incest too? Hardly a dull moment it seems in that part of Louisiana.<br /><br />  Burke tells the story masterfully, layering it on seamlessly. There is one mystery after another to be resolved and for Robicheaux, the only way to do it is through solid reasoning and surviving the close call or two. Or three or four.<br /><br />  Burke writes beautifully. He is a stylist of the first order. The story is unrelenting and absorbing. The characters are so real, you can smell their decadence.<br /><br />  Burke serves up several taut anti-climatic moments before propelling Robicheaux into the last scenes.<br /><br />  When you put this one down, having read the last word, there's a sense of relief - and a desire for more Burke and Robicheaux. Just beautiful storytelling.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-08-12

Formerly an investigator in Chicago, Fonesca tries to lead a low key life as a process server. Mired in depression and grief, he lives and works out of a low-rent office. For a depressed guy lost in himself, Lew seems to be the social hit of the town. He knows just about everyone, so it seems. This of course leads to him being called upon to help people.<br /><br />  In this novel, on the same day, an elderly woman in a nursing home calls Lew because she thinks she saw a resident being murdered. No one, of course, believes her. But Lew will investigate, just as a favor. Minutes after receiving this call, Lew is summoned to the office of one of his process serving clients. A senior partner introduces him to a woman whose son was recently run down by - are you ready - a hit-and-run driver.<br /><br />  When not talking to his neighborly therapist about his depression and grief, Lew is sort of hanging out with an assortment of other women in town. All acquaintances at best; no lovers for the grieving Lew.<br /><br />  So Lew is on the case helping to determine if indeed a resident of the assisted living facility has been murdered . . . and tracking down the hit-and-run driver who keeps calling Lew with tearful apologies when he isn't trying to run Lew down with his car.<br /><br />  It all works out in the end. With the help of a gunslinging refugee from what seems like 19th Century Montana, a little assistance from a friendly police officer and other odd and wonderful coincidences, Lew tracks down all the killers and solves all the mysteries.<br /><br />  Not exactly edge-of-your-seat reading. The plot is a bit too filled with happy coincidences that allow Lew to plod on. The characters are thin and sure do know their platitudes and cliches. Oh yes, Lew also helps a troubled young black boy out as well.<br /><br />  Overall, a lightweight mystery, fun to read.

He awakes in a Viennese park, remembering nothing, an Austrian policeman helping him up. Asked who he is, Sev produces a library card bearing the name Bernard Richter.  Richter was murdered last night, but the Austrian policeman doesn't know this - and at the moment Sev remembers nothing, not even his name.<br /><br />  Thus begins the grim tale of this dedicated investigator, torturer and murderer, this agent of a people's republic whose life is devoted to protecting an oppressive regime where, the joke goes, there are only three classes: those in prison, those who have been in prison and those who will be in prison.<br /><br />  As Brano recalls who he is, he remembers that he was to murder Richter the night before, but can't recall if that was accomplished. He remembers as well that he is the intelligence rezident in Vienne for his nation. He makes his way back to a hotel that he headquartered in, having found the embassy riddled with bugs. His assistant shows up and tells him he must leave Austria immediately. At the airport, Austrian agents try to detain him. Escapting, he boards the flight, arrives in his native country and is immediately arrested, interrogated for months and eventually released to become an assembly line worker in some obscure factory, his career in the intelligence and security organs seemingly over.<br /><br />  Sound complex? It become far more so as Brano's mentor intervenes and he is sent to his home village to investigate a returned defector. The corpses and traitors start surfacing soon after Brano's arrival.<br /><br />  Steinhauer's plot is complex, His characters are rich and cover the carnival of nationalities and forces we expect in Cold War Austria. Brano is the center of something, but we never find out what until the last few pages, much to the credit of Steinhauer. There is Dijana Frankovic, half Brano's age, beautiful, bohemian, who shares she is in love with Brano, having known him for but a few minutes. Well, maybe she's a Russian spy. Or maybe not.<br /><br />  Brano is a dedicated Communist: he even drove his father from home, something his mother still regrets.

Calling Mark Helprin's \\"Freddy and Fredericka\\" great?<br /><br />  No.<br /><br />  F&F is a sparkler. Freddy, Prince of Wales, is married to the apparently empty-headed, extravagantly tressed and dressed Fredericka. Their days are spent in meaningless rituals of charities, receptions and the seeming useless Royal activities. Freddy, an intelligent, studious man who is burdened under his obligations as a someday King is unable to keep from putting his foot in his mouth. Fredericka, initially a cutting parody of Princess Diana, flaunts her bosoms - Fredericka firmly believes that each breast is a bosom, thus she has two - spends prodigiously and revels in her publicity.<br /><br />  All this stresses Parliament, the King and Queen and enriches rival press barons as they report the capers of royalty, inventing such exploits when necessary, which is practically all the time.<br /><br />  Enter Mr. Neil, a retainer to the Queen, who may or may not be a thousand or ten thousand years old and who may or not be Merlin, but who is currently a mould maker at a sex toy factory in Italy.<br /><br />  If Freddy is to be King and Fredericka Queen, Mr. Neil says they must go on a quest. To America - and win the colonies back for England.<br /><br />  So it is and so Freddy and Fredericka are parachuted, almost nude, without food, water or anything else into the wilds of New Jersey.<br /><br />  From parody Helprin drifts into fantasy, philosophy, history, a Horatio Alger tale and most of all, a love story as Freddy and Fredericka make their way from one improbable adventure to another, ending up sedated in a California mental hospital, but vital to the election of the next American President.<br /><br />  With Helprin, there is no need to involve yourself with plot. Helprin speaks to the mind. He is funny (to the point of causing domestic disturbance if you read F&F in bed and can't keep from laughing at 4 in the morning). He is a philosopher, opining on the particular characteristics of the world's oldest monarchy and the most successful democracy in history. And he is insightful azs to the horrors and beauties of life, death and love.<br /><br />  I am not a reader of love stories or, for that matter, parodies and satires. But Helprin writes with a firm hand, his prose crisp and clear. His inventiveness literally crackles on his page as he mixes reality with fantasy, history with future. Far from the evil theorists of our day who proclaim every man a rapist and every woman a victim, Helprin sees the love between a man and a woman as the ultimate moving spirit, fulfilled by their childbearing. He really is a romantic and every reader who has the good fortune of knowing a truly loving relationship will appreciate his respect for the idea and reality of love.<br /><br />  Helprin and \\"Freddy & Fredericka\\" are marvels. Funny, happy, sad, touching, even instructive, F&F is simply, in my opinion, great.<br /><br />Jerryon the particular characteristics of the world's oldest monarchy and the most successful democracy in history.

Evanston is a prototypical \\"liberal\\" community. Anchored by Northwestern University, the town is filled with do-gooders who don't do a lot of thinking, but do make a lot of pompous gestures, such as declaring the city a \\"nuclear-free\\" zone, banning handguns and a enacting a host of other feel good laws and resolutions. Evanston is safely separated from the real world of inner-city Chicago some 12 or so miles distant. Inner-city Chicago has a very high minority population, a large percentage of which is black and the product of one-parent households. Unemployment among this community is high, education low, drug use high. The result is what Daniel Patrick Moynihan predicted in 1964: crime and poverty. (Moynihan, a political liberal, was widely jeered for his study which basically held that the deterioration of black family structure would lead to disaster, including - amazingly - crime and poverty.)<br /><br />  If Bogira could have kept stereotypical leftist bromides out of his book and retained an objective point of view, he could have produced a serious and valuable study of the operation of a single, unusually large criminal court system. Everyone in Cook County, Illinois knows that its court system, like its political structure, is corrupt, inefficient and dysfunctional. The indictment, trial, conviction and carting off to prison of Chicsgo politicians, goverment workers, police officers, lawyers and the more than occasional judge are no more remarkable than robins in spring.<br /><br />  Bogira has been a staff writer for The Chicago Reader, a so-called alternative newsweekly for 23 years. The Reader is what you would expect of a publication that aims for young adults, delights in four-letter words, exposes of how evil and corrupt the system is --- while never going so far as to offend the amazing number of advertisers whose pandering to materialism and fad spiritualism render the folded tabloid almost two inches thick every week. In other words, the Reader is a mecca of hypocrisy: social \\"conscience\\" with ads for the trendiest hair salons and places to be seen.<br /><br />  Bogira's work must be read and viewed in this context. The biases of the author must be filtered out. For Bogira, all too often, life is a collection of stereotypes. African-Americans are victims of racism. Bogira pays scant attention to victims. They are forgotten almost out of hand. He lacks the capacity for reflection and doesn't seem to grasp that the defendant in one of his vignettes is the teen-aged son of a woman who herself hasn't reached the age of 30 is also the child of a teen mother. Another of Bogira's defendants is small time drug dealer, uneducated, unskilled. For him it's \\"deal or steal.\\" Bogira would have us believe that it is society that has failed the defendant, even while repeating the words of the defendant that he knows he must either shake the drug habit he supports through criminal acts or go back to prison. The contradiction appears to escape Bogira and he never asks who this criminal might be selling drugs to and what they might be doing to \\"earn\\" the money for their purchases. Instead Bogira heaps scorn on the \\"war on drugs.\\"<br /><br />  In short Bogira pays no attention to the nature of criminals; he does not reflect at all on why a 16 year old girl stole a gun from her father and uses it to kill one of her lovers. He does not examine the psychology of his thieves, murderers and drug-dealers, thinking it enough to lament how cruelly society treats them. (A balance for Bogira's sympathetic treatment of criminals is \\"A Few Kind Words and a Loaded Gun : The Autobiography of a Career Criminal by Razor Smith,\\" an excellent autobiography of a British career criminal that reveals the utter selfishness of the criminal mind.\\"<br /><br />  Bogira, aside from his politics of blaming everyone but the criminal, does well at telling the myriad stories of the forces anddynamics of a big city criminal court. It is not pleasant. There is no happy ending. Bogira is correct that the criminal court system in Cook County, Illinois is dysfuntctional. It does not dispense justice: it meets quoatas for \\"dispos\\" (dispositions). Those who can't afford a lawyer - which includes a broad swatch of the population, including all races - don't receive the Constitutional promise of fair trials. The police often lie as, of course, do the defendants. The judges are not necessarily thoughtful or compassionate.<br /><br />  Overall, Courtroom 302 is a worthwhile read for anyone concerned with the state of our society. Thoughtful readers approaching the book without an agenda may be moved to demand reform of the system so criminals are taken out of our society and that the criminal justice system works to protect us, not the criminal.<br /><br />Jerryforces and dynamics of a big city criminal court.

The mechanics of the court system are not, for most people, comprehensible, much less exciting. Here, Levin provides solid scholarship accessible to the average person.<br /><br />  Levin does well in explaining and demonstrating how the Supreme Court - and all levels of our courts - have strayed from the intent of the Founders and established themselves as an unelected government superior in their own minds to the legislative and executive branches of government.<br /><br />  There can be no doubt of the accuracy of Levin's argument. The problem of \\"Men In Blsck\\" lies in Levin's adoption of certain cases and movements as evidence. For example, Levin chastises the  Court for holding that burning the American flag is protected under the First Amendment. Well, I consider myself a conservative - and I agree with the Court. There are simply some issues that resonable people can disagree on, but Levin doesn't seem to allow that latitude. This is regrettable, because generally Levin's arguments are strong. Likewise, Levin allows himself to get wrapped up in Roe v. Wade and the entire abortion issue. There are many people, like myself, who believe that the legal reasoning in Row v. Wade is lacking, if not entirely non-existent. Yet it is possible at the same time for even conservatives to believe the ultimate holding is correct. In fact, I know that I am not alone in believing that abortion does constitute the taking of a human life, but that government has absolutely no right to dictate what a woman may do with regard to her own body. In other words, Roe v. Wade is simply not a good way to illustrate the truth of Levin's theme that \\"the Supreme Court is destroying America.\\" It is: but Roe v. Wade is not likely to get the majority of people to agree with that premise.<br /><br />  As I said, I wish I could offer \\"Men In Black\\" higher praise, but I think Levin picked the wrong way to illustrate by choosing polarizing examples. There are numerous other Supreme Court decisions he could have used that would have brought home the point that courts in general need to be reined in and brought under the control of the people, as the Founders intended.<br /><br />Jerryds, Roe v.

That work is a helpful contrast to Lee Frost's Panoramic Photography which is both instructive and beautiful.<br /><br />  The Frost volume is richly illustrated with Frost's own panoramas which are simply beautiful. Many are panoramas from within a few miles of his home, leaving me envious. Others are from treks to Morocco, Turkey and other Asian and African locales. The photographs alone are enough to leave you satisfied.<br /><br />  But Frost provides a marvelous tutorial on every aspect of panorama photography.

An Austrian close to SS factotum Reinhard Heydrich is a spy for the Americans and about to be uncovered. Hurriedly, he fakes his death in an air raid and runs. To where, we don't yet know.<br /><br />  Calvin Cormack, a U.S. Army intelligence officer in Zurich is told to go to London. In London, Cormack, the son of a Congressman who is against American involvement in Europe, is teamed with Walter Stilton, a seemingly plodding Special Branch Inspector.<br /><br />  Stahl, the fugitive Austrian, is in England: so Cormack believes.<br /><br />  The search by Stilton and Cormack begins and the bodies start dropping soon enough. Cormack is drawn into the family life of Stilton and Lawton weaves a plot that beautifully brings in English life, American politics and the family of Freddie Troy. Troy is a homicide detective for Scotland Yard.<br /><br />  Lawton does a nice job of sketching out his characters. Interestingly, Troy plays an almost secondary role, although he is the ultimate hero of the book. The novel does move along nicely, but it is so laden with detail that it does seem to slow down from time to time.<br /><br />  Overall, Lawton does a wonderful job of creating the atmosphere of 1941 London. The characters are all believable, the story more complex on a personal level than most mysteries and the plot doesn't have any disturbing jumps. Overall, a very entertaining read.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-07-22

Nothing like that to be found here. This book covers the well-known and the already well-described.<br /><br />  Overall rhe book is disappointing. Frommer's or similar guides generally tell you much more about the areas. I admit, though, that I may not get the point of this book. It may be nothing more than a journal of a single traveller , not particularly intended to inform, but more to record the individual's experience.

Rain, the offspring of a Japanese father and American mother is a contemporary samurai who continually muses over his chosen career as a very high-priced, meticulous assassin. Rain has what many might consider \\"problems,\\" such as lack of a permanent love interest and so on. In \\"Killing Rain,\\" the fourth in the John Rain series, aging becomes another of his concerns.<br /><br />  Through a intermediary, a gorgeous Israeli intelligence agent who specializes in seduction to serve her country, Rain is hired to kill an Israeli who sells knowledge of explosives to terrorists. Rain has acquired a sort-of partner, known as Dox (as in \\"unorthodox\\"), a large, verbose American. Dox's specialty is as a sniper.<br /><br />  The two track down the target, Manny, to Manilla and in Rain's typically painstaking (and thrilling way) set the scene for his demise. The ambush goes wrong and among the dead are two men who might be CIA agents. Rain's concern for Manny's young son is what makes the assination go wrong. Rain has scruples: he isn't just anyone's murderer.<br /><br />  The beauty of reading Eisler is that he takes you into the very complex mind of John Rain and some of the people he interacts with. Their is Deliah, the beautiful Israel agent. Dox who appears to be superficial, but is not. Even with minor characters, Eisler manages to evoke depth in them.<br /><br />  The action moves from the Phillipines to China and is unrelenting. Now Rain and Dox are being hunted by the Israelis and a mysterious organization that may or may not be connected to the CIA.<br /><br />  It never stops. Eisler keeps pouring it on and Rain keeps thinking and thinking. And the reader keeps reading and reading until long into the night, unless they have a self-discipline I lack.<br /><br />  Eisler has created a grand character in John Rain, the assassin who thinks . . . and kills with mind-gripping perfection.<br /><br />Jerryth mind-gripping perfection. <br /> <br />Jerry	2005-07-22

Aerial photographs, of course, are inherently interesting because of their perspective and the integral beauty of virtually any planetary feature from above. None of the photographs can be considered spectacular in the same vein as Ansel Adam's greatest work, but they are appealing. Speaking of the photography alone, \\"Revealing Chicago\\" is a worthwhile addition to a Chicagoan's or photographer's library.<br /><br />  The accompanying text, however, is disturbing. Harry N. Abrams, Inc., a well regarded publisher of \\"coffee table\\" art books has made a mistake in letting the pages of its publications to be used as a vehicle for political polemic, especially of the kind in these pages.<br /><br />  There is to me a disturbing similarity between \\"Revealing Chicago\\" and the glossy books and magazines churned out in Germany during WWII. These publications featured terrific photography showing SS and other German troops in the Ukraine, France, Poland and other conquered territories. The Germans were always smiling, always helping the locals. The text portrayed tales of how the Germans were helping the \\"liberated\\" peoples. Not shown were the mass murders, the enslavement and other horrors of th German conquest.<br /><br />  Evans bills herself as an \\"adovcate artist.\\" And the philosophy advocated here by Evans and her sponsors in a new fascism, where a select few dictate how every one else lives. In the numerous bits of prose, regulating driving through higher taxes, consolidating local government entities to facilitate central planning, zoning to ensure \\"proper\\" population are among the rostrums advocated. One of the most hilarious sections concerns the Chicago Board of Education, claiming that with a $4 billion budget, it is underfunded and, of course, advocating higher local property taxes and appropriation of property taxes on a state level. Not mentioned at all is the horrendous waste, graft, corruption and union practices that waste perhaps half or more the Board's budget.<br /><br />  The photographs in \\"Revealing Chicago\\" are interesting, but the political propaganda is reprehensible and chilling. I do hope this is simply a one-time mistake by Abrams and not evidence of a newly adopted philosophy.<br /><br />Jerryendous waste, graft, corruption and union practices that waste perhaps half or more the Board's budget. <br /> <br />  The photographs in \\"Revealing Chicago\\" are interesting, but the political propaganda is reprehensible and chilling.

He checks with his friend, a local police officer with problems of his own. The friend urges Billy not to make an official report; he will take care of it.<br /><br />  Soon corpses are popping up all over the landscape as Billy is put to the test time after time.

Dale Brown is always interesting to read because you can never be certain of what he will come up with. Sometimes, of course, as with any person who experiments, the results are less than optimal.<br /><br />  On his first outing with a new theme, Brown has created an enjoyable techno-thriller, but compared to his greatest stuff, it is middling at best. However, the new cast of characters he has created will undoubtedly appear again and I expect that as he becomes more familiar with his characters, that a blockbuster or two will emerge.<br /><br />  \\"Act Of War\\" is definitely not a blockbuster, but it isn't a bad read.<br /><br />  A petro facility on the outskirts of Houston is nuked. (Talk about starting off with a bang.) The facility is owned by Harold Chester Kingman, the master of TransGlobal Energy Corporation. Needless to say, Kingman and TransGlobal are stereotyped: the greedy capitalist who uproots peasants from their homes, yada, yada. While government is still mobilizing to cope with the disaster, Kristen Skyy, ace reporter for SATCOM One TV news helicopters into the area, reporting live. Lois Lane, Superman's pal, is more believable, but Brown has a purpose for Skyy. Oh golly, the superheated air around the blast site forces Skyy's helicopter down just as they were about to rescue some schoolchildren from the blast zone!<br /><br />  No need to fear, though, for Major Jason Richter appears in his CID, a nine-foot exoskeleton affair with some rather amazing capabilities. The good Major rescues Kristen, the children and becomes a hero, especially so it seems to Robert Chamberlain, National Security Advisor.<br /><br />  Within days, Chamberlain has formed a special task force to hunt down terrorists. The task force is strange, co-commanded by Richter, who is an Army engineer, and an FBI intelligence analyst, along with an Army Sergeant Major, who is Chamberlain's aide. Amazingly, Richter clashes with the FBI agent about strategy, tactics and the time of day.<br /><br />  Things move quickly now as the FBI gains information that a Braizillian environmentalist group called GAMMA seems to be the perpetrators of the nuclear explosion. Of course, the FBI doesn't share that information with Richter: he gains that knowledge by eavesdropping with more high-tech devices.<br /><br />  The story moves fast now, with the task force heading off to Brazil and the introduction of a somewhat mysterious Russian who has taken over GAMMA and plans still greater destruction.<br /><br />  Brown is a great action writer who has a pretty fair grasp of the technology of today and the near future. Generally his characters have quite a bit of depth: not so this time. Most of the characters are weak, but I am certain they will be far stronger in future novels featuring Richter and CID. Brown's plot also seems a bit off this time around.<br /><br />  Overall, though, \\"Act Of War\\" is still a good read for any techno-thriller fan. It is neither Brown's best or his worst: but it is still better than the work of many of his imitators in this genre.

The Times never deserved the reputation it once had and is now nothing more than a megaphone for pseudo-intellectuals who think nothing of lying through their teeth at every turn.<br /><br />  Thus it is a pleasant surprise to find that Linda Greenhouse who has covered the Supreme Court for the Times since 1978 has written a simply marvelous of Justice Harry Blackmun.<br /><br />  She gives full credit to the voluminous archives maintained by Blackmun from his youth through his dying day.<br /><br />  Blackmun is widely known as the author of the highly contentious Roe v. Wade opinion. Although Greenhouse tends to lionize Blackmun for this and other feminist favored decisions, her propagandizing does not obscure the truth: Harry Blackmun was  a man who never forgot about the \\"little people.\\"<br /><br />  Greenhouse ultimately applies the label \\"liberal\\" to Blackmun, but this too is misleading. Blackmun was a jurist who took his responsibilities to protect and enforce the Constitution of the United States seriously. His decisions, as recounted by Greenhouose, tended toward insuring that the ordinary citizen was accorded all the blessings the Constitution was intended to bestow. To label that tendency as \\"liberal\\" is crass politizing that Greenhouse could have - and should have - avoided.<br /><br />  Fortunately Blackmun's archives are allowed to speak.

Rollins attempts to imitate Clive Cussler --- a masterful storyteller who can pull his readers along dizzying, incredible plot twists --- and Dan Brown who weaves myth, legend, fact and falsehood into a compelling story.<br /><br />  Rollins fails in his attenpt.<br /><br />  \\"Map of Bones\\" is nothing more than a cartoon, one unbelievable scene after another. His heroes are oh-so-perfect: one repeatedly throws a knife in darkness, hitting the enemy in the throat. All of Rollins' characters are stick-figure cartoons: the Roadrunner and Wiley E. Coyote have greater depth and believability. Gray Pierce, the SIGMA operative, has time to follow the trace of swelling breast of his Italian police colleague while the two face death. (Rollins attempts to weave two love stories into the mix as well.)<br /><br />  Raoul, one of the bad guys, needs only a greasepaint mustache to make him a poor imitation of the over-acted villains of silent films, really bad silent films.<br /><br />  The story itself is nonsensical. Enlightened minds since before the dawn of civilization knew the secrets of super-conductors. Of course, this knowledge was lost in more recent times and now the bad guys, old blooded aristocrats, are searching for the lost secret so they can take over the world and make everyone else a slave. Ho-hum.<br /><br />  Rollins simply lacks the skill to come even close to pulling it off. His writing is boringly formulaic. As noted, every few paragraphs constitutes another attempt on the lives of the gallant heroes. It's just silly.<br /><br />  The torture scenes are unintentionally hilarious, but not nearly as torturious as reading all 431 pages of this piece of excruciating silliness.<br /><br />  Clive Cussler, Dan Brown, Tom Clancy and other talented thriller writers need not live in fear: Rollins is definitely not about to surpass -- or join -- them.<br /><br />Jerry1 pages of this piece of excruciating silliness. <br /> <br />  Clive Cussler, Dan Brown, Tom Clancy and other talented thriller writers need not live in fear: Rollins is definitely not about to surpass -- or join -- them. <br /> <br />Jerry <br /> <br />	2005-07-11

Vastly overpriced.	I sincerely wish Corinna Jacobs had tried a bit harder or had a different publisher and editor because this book could have been a classic.<br /><br />  Jacobs attempts to provide a comprehensive overview of digital panoramic photography. Unfortunately that's precisely what she does. The book is long on overview, some of it of no interest to the average photographer. The sections on $20,000 panoramic imaging systems could easily have been eliminated. Where she describes techniques of panoramic photography and, more importantly, putting the panorama together, the sparsity of detail takes it toll. In the end there is littl, if any, information here that you couldn't find on the web or in the Help files that accompany the stitching software she speaks of.<br /><br />  While \\"Interactive Panoramas\\" could serve as a passable reference manual, the price of over $50 rules this out. I would pay not more than $25 for this book and even that would be a stretch. I suspect this book is intended as a college text: my heart goes out to those who are forced to expend their limited budgets on this book.<br /><br />  Hopefully, Ms. Jacobs will find the opportunity to expound on the subject for O'Reilly or another publisher with a different, better attitude toward the reader. I am sure she knows the subject and has much valuable insight to impart: but it just doesn't happen in \\"Interactive Panoramas.\\"<br /><br />Jerry	2005-07-11

The wife of an old friend visits Harry and asks him to investigate the \\"suicide\\" of her husband, whom she suspects was actually murdered. His medications, you see, were altered and the daily pills that were necessary to sustain his transplanted heart were an ineffective powder.<br /><br />  Harry takes the assignment and within a few pages is launched into a deadly quest for a supremely well skilled serial killer. Enter Rachael Walling, FBI Agent.<br /><br />  The two stories, that of Bosch and of Walling, run parallel and then converge as they become both hunters and hunted. Connelly's plot is tight, filled with twists and turns. One of the nice things about his writing is that many of plot inventions are unexpected, lending to the compulsion to keep turning pages.<br /><br />  The characters are richly drawn. Harry Bosch is fully developed. Not a super-hero: just somehing of an ordinary guy, getting on in years, but a dedicated, thorough and intelligent investigator. The bad guy in this one, Harry Backus, isn't well developed, but he's so evil, it doesn't matter. You really don't want to know that much about him: you just want to see him dead before he kills someone else.<br /><br />  Altogether, a great read.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-07-08

Delaware goes to the meeting place, but Duchay never shows. His body, a single bullet through the brain, is discovered a few hours later.<br /><br />  Enter Milo Sturgis, a rather remarkable LAPD detective whom Delaware has worked with before. Together they begin the hunt for the murderer.<br /><br />  The trial to the bad guy turns out to be littered with bodies. The problem is that the prime suspect just doesn't seem to fit until Delaware and Sturgis dig much deeper, when they realize that the real murderer has been close at hand all the time.<br /><br />  Kellermnan's plot is filled with twists and turns, some of them requiring more than a small leap on the reader's part.

This is in an odd way a police procedural, but among the richest such i have ever read. A priest is dead. Frank Redmond, a Catholic priest, fell into the street from a New York rooftop. Was it murder or, as the detectives at the scene believe, a suicide?<br /><br />  Deputy Chief Gabe Driscoll wants to know and pushes the precinct to investigate. Driscoll is perilously close to stepping on the toes of other police officers. He is the head of Internal Affairs and has no right to be involving himself in the investigation of a declared suicide which might be a murder.<br /><br />  But it doesn't matter to Driscoll: Father Redmond, you see, was a friend of his since high school. He enlists the help of Andrew Troy, a Pulitzer-prize winning journalist and also a friend since high school of Driscoll and the late Father Redmond, to investigate the death.<br /><br />  Thus begins the unraveling of seven lives. It is an absorbing and sad tale beginning with these four young men and their achievements as a swim team and the quarter-century after. I have rarely read anything so sad. These men are all ordinary, though each of them was brave in their own ways. Driscdll has risen through the New York Police Department to two-star rank as an honest cop who solved homicides. Troy is a globe-hopping journalist who has won a sterling reputation for the honesty of his writing. Earl Finley, another member of the quartet, strives diligently as a prosecutor to seek truth in the criminal courts of a city overrun by crime. And Frank Redmond becomes a priest who serves with the military in VietNam, spends years in Africa tending to the poorest of the poor and comes home to serve the poor again in Harlem.<br /><br />  Redmond is dead: a priest dead perhaps by his own hand - or possibly by the hand of one of the bad people he has kept from preying on his flock.<br /><br />  Driscoll and Troy search for the truth. Intrinsic to the story is the Roman Catholic Church and a woman, the teenage love of the late Father Redmond.<br /><br />  There are no Wagnerian heroics in this novel, but heroic acts abound just in the daily lives of the main characters. Daley has created characters unique and powerful in their ordinariness. We all know people like those Daley writes abou, for they are to one degeee or another ourselves.<br /><br />  This is not a happy book. The calvary do not come riding over the hill in the nick of time.

I'm sure others have their favorites, but Reacher to me represents the epitome of the hero. An odd kind of hero to be sure: a couple or so decades ago, Reacher would have been considered an anti-hero.<br /><br />  Reacher, a veteran of more than a decade in the military (and eight prior novels) has decided to fly under the radar. He has no permanent address; no credit cards; no phone; nothing that can be used to locate him. No job or significant other either. Reacher goes as the spirit moves him.<br /><br />  And the spirit often seems to move him toward involvement in troublesome situations.<br /><br />  This time, Reacher is enjoying the morning after with a Norwegian he picked up on a Miami Beach. He glimpses a television news report that one James Barr had gone on a shooting spree. Reacher, wearing only the clothes on his back, boards a bus --- airplane travel leaves a paper trail --- and heads off to an unnamed Indiana city.<br /><br />  As it happens, upon being arrested for shooting down four people, Barr had asked for Reacher. The reason turns out to be a surprise.<br /><br />  Child's Jack Reacher novels are loaded with surprises, one after another. The man (Childs) raises plotting to an art. His characters are rich and multifaceted even when introduced only peropherally. Lee Childs is simply a master of his craft and every page is a delight.<br /><br />  I don't like to describe the plot and action of a novel in any great detail because I thnink that steals the pleasure of it from others who have yet to read it, so I'll spare you a lengthy description of what happens in \\"One Shot.\\" What I will say is that I devoured it in a single night because the novel really is a classic page-turner.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-07-02

Assigned to the Open-Unsolved (formerly cold case) unit, Bosh begins with an immersion in departmental politics. The Chief himself welcomes Bosch back and lectures him about how the police department is changing under his regime.<br /><br />  Within hours, however, the old regime reasserts itself when a Deputy Chief waylays Harry and tells him that his days as a retread are numbered.<br /><br />  The first case for Harry is a 17 year old murder of a teenaged girl. Turns out that the murder weapon retained a bit of flesh which leads through DNA testing to identifying a suspect in the cold case.<br /><br />  Reunited with his former partner, Detective Kiz Rider, Harry sets out to solve the crime. Turns out that a secret unit in the police department back in the 1980s may have played some dirty tricks with the original investigation of the murder and, perhaps, deliberately forced the investigating detectives to veer  away from certain inquiries and maybe a politically important suspect. And guess what? The Deputy Chief just happened to be the head of that unit and is still angling to become Chief of the department.<br /><br />  Connelly's plotting is beautiful. There is no shortage of genuine surprises in \\"The Closers.\\" Harry and Kiz doggedly follow one lead after another, each lead developed as a result of their scrupulous (and fascinating) investigation.<br /><br />  Departmental politics start heating up; egos are bruised, old failures uncovered. The delicate nature of the survivor's parents lives after the brutal murder of their daughter are unfolded.<br /><br />  Telling more of the story might take away some of the pleasure of reading \\"The Closers.\\" Suffice it to say it's a fine piece of work.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-06-30

His thesis is that the generations of video and computer gameplayers and other fun-seekers are really expanding their intellects in a 21st Century way. For example, Johnson tells us that intellectual inquiry is alive and well because millions watch \\"24 Hours\\" and \\"West Wing\\" and then scrutinize and annotate each episode on online forums with \\"an intensity usually reserved for Talmudic scholars.\\"<br /><br />  Uh, I don't think so. Consider that \\"24 Hours,\\" \\"West Wing\\" and  their ilk are totsl fiction, fluffy entertainment, dealing with make-believe. The Talmud deals with issues central to faith, morality and in no small way with the history of at least one part of civilization. Johnson doesn't seem to understand the difference.<br /><br />  Essentially this is a feel-good book for dummies. It tells people who know nothing that they know something, for example all the tricks to playing an adventure-style video game. The National Constitution Center surveyed teenagers and found that while only about four in 10 could name the three branches of the federal government fully six in 10 could name all Three Stooges. Johnson does not apparently understand that while playing a videogame may lead to your becoming an expert in playing that game, it does not necessarily lead to your acquiring practical knowledge or the ability to think intelligently about real-world issues.<br /><br />  Johnson creates some laughable theses. For example, he exclaims  that \\"[o]ver the last ten years - a period of unprecedented _fictional_ violence . . . the country simultaneously experienced the most dramatic drop in violent crime in its history.\\" First of all, for most of its history, the United States did not maintain comprehensive statistical records of violent. The FBI comprehensive crime reports are of relatively recent origin. Second, Johnson's assertion is flawed because of other factors: demographics and mandatory sentencing. There are fewer violent crimes because the age group that committs most of them became smaller and more felons were imprisoned than ever before in our history. Finally Johnson, had he checked any facts whatsoever, would have learned that it is indisputable that today's violent criminals start earlier and are far more vicious than in earlier eras. So the overall rate of violent crime has dropped, but the nature of the crimes has grown more severe with the perpetrators growing younger.<br /><br />  So Johnson praises someone who has written and posted on the Internet a 164-page \\"walk-through\\" of a videogame, \\"an authoritative guide to one of the most popular games of all time.\\" So what? That doesn't mean the writer of the guide has any practical knowledge or even a well-developed intelligence. A major computer \\"hacking\\" case was perpetrated by an idiot savant who spent his entire life taking scripts and tools written by others and using them to trespass computer systems. Johnson seems to be praising this kind of activity as a form of genius.<br /><br />  Somehow I suspect that Johnson holds those teenagers who know the names of the Three Stooges in higher regard than those who know the three branches of government or, worse yet, can describe them and their functions intelligently.<br /><br />Jerry\\" First of all, for most of its history, the United States did not maintain comprehensive statistical records of violent.

In \\"1776\\" McCullough paints a compelling, moving portrait of George Washington and the few other leaders who had the courage to face a superior enemy through numerous defeats and few victories.<br /><br />  Washington is shown as a determined man, suffering betrayals from his closest confidants, forever worried about the quality of his army, which the British and Hessians dismissed as rabble.<br /><br />  Washington, the general, had no significant military training. What he had was a mind formed by he is own life experience. No significant formal education; no apprenticeship at the hand of a military leader. Many of his decisions were flat-out poor. Some were daring and in retrospect brilliant.<br /><br />  But Washington and a few close to him were passionately animated by their cause: independence and freedom, the desire to live their lives as they chose, not subservient to those born to the right to rule them.<br /><br />  One can read another message for our day in McCullough's writing, but I'll leave it to the reader to determine if they find that message.<br /><br />  \\"1776\\" is a masterful work by a more than competent historian.

Since the Secretary of Homeland Security was tipped in advance of the plot --- and ignored the warning --- he fears that the Secret Service is up to no good. The Director of the Secret Service is a close buddy of the FBI boss, so they're suspected as well.<br /><br />  Thus does lawyer Joe DeMarco single handedly set out to get to the bottom of the evil cabal.<br /><br />  Yes, the story is thin. But it's fun. Lawson is quite inventive and conjurs up a Southern baron who makes Faulkner's folks look normal. The characters don't have much depth, but Lawson does an excellent job with dialog. Lots of quick thinking, lots of derring-do and an assortment of weird living things not seen in most zoos.<br /><br />  All in all, a fun, enjoyable read and not a bad mystery as well.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-06-18

Tough, but soft; chronically depressed, but always hopeful; crafty to a fault. Valentine is an ex-cop from Atlantic City who now consults with casinos eager to catch scammers, if not stop them before they win a penny.<br /><br />  This is the third of the Tony Valentine mysteries. The first one (\\"Grift Sense\\") was dynamite - and each successor has gotten better.<br /><br />  The action takes place largely at a Florida Indian Reservation casino. A blackjack player is dealt 84 winning hands in a row, a statistical impossibility.The dealer disappears. But that's only the beginning of the story as Tony gets involved. The blackjack scam is only the tip of the iceberg.<br /><br />  Every page is fun. Swain's plots are complex, but always believable. The characters, each and every one of them, radiate believability.<br /><br />  Swain's style is compelling and Tony Valentine is one heck of a hero.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-06-14

The wise-cracking, cynical private eyes, the sultry women of mystery and the wonderfully bleak view of the world?<br /><br />  Hello William Lashner and his creation Victor Carl. Welcome a world of sleaze and crassness where nary a hopeful day is seen.<br /><br />  Victor Carl is retained to seek a new trial for a chef now sitting in prison for the murder of his wife. Carl is a cynic, a man seemingly defeated by the very concept of optimism. He operates a creaky two-person law office with his partner, a woman named . . . oh, she's forgettable, so forget it.<br /><br />  Most of the other other characters are equally forgettable, but no need for concern, because Lashner's dialog propels the story. It's crackling good, filled with dark humor.<br /><br />  One of the best characters - and a central one - is a dentist who seems determined to save the world. He knows everyone. Helps everyone.<br /><br />  Interleaved with the murder mystery is Carl's suprising attempts to help a pair of young children as their involuntary pro bono lawyer. Lashner's creation of this scenario is a stroke of genius, levelling out the cynicism of Carl's character.<br /><br />  Overall, a wonderful read and a pretty good mystery.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-06-14

Am I angry because I am reading a retelling of \\"The Count Of Monte Cristo\\" set in the present day? Or do I lay back an enjoy the ride, preferably on a sunny day on the beach or a rainy day indoors.<br /><br />  There is no real brilliance here. The characters will be more than vaguely familiar to anyone who has read Monte Cristo. A promising young man is sent to prison, courtesy of his \\"friends\\" and a corrupt prosecutor, for a murder he didn't commit. For almost 20 years, our hero is anything but a model prisoner, spending most of his time in solitary confinement. But, lo and behold, he meets an elderly prisoner who befriends him, promises a way to escape and offers to share a fortune with him. Does all this sound familiar?<br /><br />  Anyway, they escape. But the benefactor is killed during the escape. No problem: Raymond makes it, hides out on an Indian reservation, locates the cabin where the treasure is hidden, becomes filthy rich, buys the Mets (no, I am not kidding) and a Gulfstream jet (still not kidding) and begins the process of taking \\"exact revenge\\" on his betrayers.<br /><br />  And that's what he does in some fairly entertaining ways.<br /><br />  Oh, he is also surprised by a thing or to, but I'm not going to ruin the surprise which won't be a surprise if you remember Count Of Monte Cristo.<br /><br />  Don't let my mocking tone fool you: this is actually a fun read. It won't keep you awake at night, will evoke a chuckle or two and for anyone who has ever had a desire to get \\"exact revenge\\" on their adversaries, it is a satisfying fantasy.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-06-13

He escapes within minutes of landing, desperate to establish contact with his family - Al Queda.<br /><br />  Turns out that big cheeses at terrorist central have been waiting for his return and want him for a super-secret mission of destruction. Thus the terrorist, known as Caleb, begins his trek across mountains and desert. He is aided by minions sent to fetch him, most of whom seem to know his importance, but who won't tell him or us, though it is hinted at.<br /><br />  The catch: Caleb it appears is a bit addled and on top of that either has amnesia, has been brainwashed, represses his memory of the past or is just a nutcase. In any event, you rapidly get the impression that Caleb is not merely an Afghani cab driver.<br /><br />  The problem is that Seymour is plodding, plodding, plodding. A trip through the Empty Quarter is boring, boring, boring. All the characters taste like a wall of desert sand. They are dry, dull, boring and as believable as late-night infomercial.<br /><br />  The plot is replete with twists and turns. Pity that so few of them are believable.<br /><br />  All the same, this is an excellent thriller for when you have nothing else to read. It is readable, but not terribly interesting and, frankly, dull.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-06-13

It was an auspicious start to what is now a series of several fine mysteries. Valentine is a former Atlantic City detective turned consultant to casinos trying to protect themselves against cheats.<br /><br />  Swain obviously knows the gambling industry well. He informs as he develops the story, telling of how the cheaters operate and what the casinos do to stop them. That alone would keep a reader glued to the pages. But Swain is better than that. His plots flow smoothly, without the need for jarring contrivances. His characters are possessed of human scope.<br /><br />  The story line is a fun one, with Valentine playing hero to a falsely accused and villain to those who so richly deserve.<br /><br />  Just plain fun.

James Swain is a great writer and an expert on sleight-of-hand and gambling.

Tony takes up the case of figuring out how a casino was taken for $ 6 million.<br /><br />  Swain's plots are always thick and this is no exception. All the characters are richly human and believable.<br /><br />  Swain doesn't need a lot of unlikely contrivances to move his plot forward. There are some, but they don't make your eyes bug out.<br /><br />  Just a plain fun read.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-06-13

And there is Elmore Leonard who seeming transcends classification.<br /><br />  Leonard is at his lyrical, mythmaking best here as he tells the story of a little Oklahoma boy who is robbed of his ice cream cone by a two-bit bank robber, an event that shapes his future.<br /><br />  Carl Webster grows to be a man and becomes a Deputy United States Marshall during the heyday of bank robbers. Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, Bonny and Clyde capture the nation's attention, while J. Edgar Hoover, Melvin Purvis and - of course - Carl Webster seek their own headlines.<br /><br />  In a millieu of dirt-poor farmers become millionaires through the Oklahoma oil boom, whores with good hearts, a rich man's son turned bad and the muse of Tony Antonelli, crime reporter, all the stories mix and blend thanks to Leonard's gifted pen.<br /><br />  Each of the characters is rich and full-blooded. The scent of Oklahonma's backroads and Kansas City's opulent brothels and their denizens is strong as the trails of bandits, lawmen, rich men, demented mothers, prostitutes and demented sons cross and re-cross.<br /><br />  Elmore Leonard has crafted many a fine tale: but \\"The Hot Kid\\" is undoubtedly one of his best and a thoroughly satisfying read.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-06-06

And Razor Smith is not a notorious criminal of the Dillinger variety. He's a common thief, a man who used guns, knives and other physical violence to frighten others into giving them his money. He justifies  his bank robberies, his primary vocation, by saying the deposits were insured. But who does Smith think pays for the insurance premiums? Who does Smith think pays for the stress and trauma he inflicted on innocent people who just happened to be there when he threatened their lives with his gun?<br /><br />  None of that, however, takes away from Smith's skill as a writer. Now serving what could be the rest of his natural life in prison, much of Smith's autobiography sounds like leftists like Leonard Bernstein during the 70s: it's the victim's fault for making the criminal. Nonsense. Smith chose his own life.<br /><br />  Smith appears remarkably candid in recounting his youth and how he gravitated toward the criminal life, not only because it beat working in more traditional means to earn a living, but because such petty criminality is remarkably common in England. At first I didn't believe Smith's tales of promiscuous youthful violence as a way of English life. A bit of research confirmed his claims. England is not Paradise.<br /><br />  As a grown man whose son had his own problems with the police and committed suicide, Smith sounds remorseful. Whether this is a ploy to advance his claim for parole is obviously unknowable. Regardless, Smith's memoir of his life is an enthrally, worthwhile excursion into the criminal's mind. Well-written and absorbing.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-06-05

But Cornwell is skilled and always retains control of his material, so he succeeds at weaving his tale of battle, treason, cowardice and heroism, all based (loosely) on actual events with the occasional fictional, but believable, character thrown in for color.<br /><br />  The details of the story don't really matter.

Bryan and Thomas Wolf are to be commended for rescuing this story of injustice from obscurity. The tale they tell of a woman accused of murdering her husband in 1900 on an Iowa farm. They do a solid job of interweaving social outlooks, the mechanics of the judicial process of the time along with its biases and prejudices, especially toward women.<br /><br />  But the problem I encountered is the author's style: not quite pedantic, but terribly slow. I can recognize their dilemma. Too many adjectives would have turned a solid recounting into a scandal sheet special. Still they never seem to become more exciting than reading a trial transcript, which is usually pretty dull.<br /><br />  On the whole, well worth reading. But be prepared to endure. Take it in small chunks and resist the temptation to put it aside entirely. The story ultimately is interesting, but would have been more interesting in the hands of more skillful writers.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-06-05

Cornwell's device is Uhtred, the 10 year old son of a minor chieftain, who is taken by the Danes, raised in the Viking ways of war and accepted as a Viking warrior.<br /><br />  A priest becomes the medium through which the boy grows into a man and meets Alfred, the King who will take the first major steps in uniting England.<br /><br />  Cornwell's story is well plotted, his characters are delightfully rich and his history both interesting and fascinating.

Coben's plotting reminds me of a gnarly tree: it starts at the bottom with a trunk and than branches off with some of the branches intertwining with others. Stories and characters overlap, but not to point of confusion.<br /><br />  Coben is a master. In \\"The Innocent,\\" he has written a superb mystery thriller.

Every problem is described in the most extreme language. All criticisms of those not agreeing with Wallis' views are also extreme and, often, provably untrue.<br /><br />  Wallis fails to attribute his social solutions to Marx, Lenin, Mussolini, Hitler and other original authors, but instead claims they are divinely inspired. Any student of history would realize that these are old nostrums, requiring that earners be stripped of their earnings by bureaucrats in order to \\"redistrbute\\" wealth, make everyone equal in their misery and thus create a perfect world.<br /><br />  Some of Wallis' ideas echo the long discredited America First that pretended that there was no evil in the world meriting the attention of the United States. Ignoring such evil resulted in WWII and the deaths of millions of innocent people.<br /><br />  It could be argued that Wallis is well-intentioned. I doubt it. The self-absorption demonstrated in the book depicts a man of ego, not a man of religion. Wallis must recount all the luminaries he claims to know, all the events he has attended.<br /><br />  In short, Wallis is political and so is his professed god.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-04-27

U.S. Marshall Roland Larson is part of the detail protecting Hope Stevens, a witness in the prosecution of the vicious Romero crime family.<br /><br />  The Marshalls move Hope frequently to keep her alive but, alas, one day luck runs out and a brutal murderer enters the bus where she sits and murders a couple of her guards. Roland, who just happens to be off the bus, is too late to the immediate scene to do more than slightly injure the murderer who makes a clean getaway.<br /><br />  So does Hope.<br /><br />  Years later, Roland is still madly in love with the witness he lost and has been searching for across the country.<br /><br />  Whoo-hoo! Roland thinks he hears Hope's distinctive laugh at a Shakespere performance. Of course, Roland has been attending Shakespeare plays in the hope of finding Hope.<br /><br />  From this point on, the story is conventional. Hope has a daughter now. Hope disappears again with Roland on her trail, but guess what? Someone else is as well, a brutal murderer who appears to be the same killer who attacked the bus.<br /><br />  Everything about this novel is predictable, which doesn't lessen the pleasure of reading it.

Paul Tomm, 23, works for a small-town newspaper. A local resident, essentially unknown in the town, dies and Paul is assigned to write the obituary of Professor Jaan Puhapaev. Very quickly, Paul learns the obscure decedent is indeed a man of mystery. As this story unravels, author Jon Fasman takes us on a tour of alchemy and alchemists and murder.<br /><br />  Fasman does well with his characters. Paul Tomm has some depth as do his employer, a new romantic interest, some assorted professors and cops and of course a few low lifes and murderers. None of the characters ever becomes compellingly real, but they are more than enough to keep the story moving.<br /><br />  The plot, however, is a bit of a different matter. It is actually quite solid until the very, very end, at which point the  novel unravels a bit.<br /><br />  On the whole though, Fasman has done a marvelous job of weaving his story from the distant past and the immediate present. Well done, overall, and a thoroughly enjoyable read.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-04-25

From the very first people, acting entirely on their desire to protect themselves, who simply got out of the WTC as quickly as possible to those who attempted to help others and perished in the effort, every story is fascinating. One can only imagine the terror felt by those in the buildings and imagine how you would react. My chest tightened at the idea of walking down smoke filled stairwells, not knowing what was happening. Frightening and Dwyer and Flynn tell the story well.<br /><br />  Their biting criticism of the New York Police and Fire Departments appears to be justified. The news of the time portrayed the firefighters in particular as heroic victims when in fact they may have been victims of an inbred fire department bureaucracy that was more deserving of criminal prosecution than accolades. By the same token, many of the firefighters come off individually as very brave men. (Interestingly, I did not note a single mention of a female firefighter involved in toting heavy loads up the floors the fire department was able to reach. Could it be that the women didn't attempt the effort with loads of nearly one hundred pounds? Did the media fail to publicize this?)<br /><br />  Dwyer and Flynn also rap the Port Authority for its insistence on building the WTC without due consideration of what would happen if the \\"impossible\\" happened and the entire complex had to be evacuated.<br /><br />  Overall, \\"102 Minutes\\" is an excellent history of how thousands of ordinary people reacted to a unheard of situation; how the police and fire departments responded to a situation they were unprepared for and how the WTC represented a potential deathtrap for more than 15,000 people that was avoided only because people thought for themselves.<br /><br />  The only thing that marred the book for me was the intrusion of the author's politically correct left-wing politics in a few places. I guess the need for such polemics is ingrained in Times employees, but they would have been better served - and the reader better served - if they simply didn't bother.<br /><br />Jerrythe women didn't attempt the effort with loads of nearly one hundred pounds?

Peter Fenton served for fifteen years as a tabloid reporter for the National Enquirer. Considering that the National Enquirer is a tabloid, I'm not sure of what other reporters they could have other than tabloid reporters. That quibble aside, it should be noted that the National Enquirer and its tabloid reporters have been known to engage in a bit of hyperbole and invention now and then.<br /><br />  Reading Fenton's engaging \\"Eyeing the Flash,\\" I came to the conclusion that Fenton stretches the truth here and there if not everywhere.<br /><br />  That said, \\"Eyeing the Flash\\" is a fun read even if not a single word of it reflects any event in Peter Fenton's life. The book purports to describe carnival life and the hucksters who run the fixed games and sell the stale food. The characters are, frankly, pretty stale themselves, recognizable from dozens of novels and biographies that describe the outcasts and marginalia of society. None of these folks are admirable in any way, not that it matters.<br /><br />  So is \\"Eyeing the Flash\\" autobiography as the author appears to claim? It doesn't feel that way to me. Is it fiction? It might be and as such it is mildly entertaining. The characters are well painted even if they sound like the same kind of petty, self-absorbed folks you've read about a thouand times before.<br /><br />  Is \\"Eyeing the Flash\\" worth the time? Sure. It's got enough verve and style to get you through a 4 hour flight or a couple of  evenings of pre-sleep reading.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-04-16

But the reality is that the campaign was intended to terrorize the German populaion into demanding that their leadership end the barbarous war they started. Ultimately, as Hastings notes, there was no such thing as an innocent German civilian. Each in their own way contributed or supported the slaughter and enslavement of millions by German soldiers and bureaucrats.<br /><br />  Hasting's contribution is to strip the British effort down to its barest essentials: its beginnings as the only effort the otherwise defeated and defenseless British could muster to the excesses of the bombing in the last few months of the war when almost everythng that could be destroyed had been destroyed.<br /><br />  Hasting has a wonderful approach, weaving general history into individual stories of the bombers, the planners, the civilians and soldiers.<br /><br />  For everyone with an interest in accurate history, \\"Bomber Command\\" is essential reading.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-04-10

It takes the classic aggrieved spy tale, betrayed by his masters and turns the genre on its head.<br /><br />  George and Charlie work at a photo kiosk. Charlie suspects George is a spy and, so, spies on George. Charlie also suspects one of the customers of the photo kiosk of being a spy as well and stakes out her hotel. Some sleuth Charlie is: the woman sends over a drink and invites Charlie to her room. Some very interesting events occur, resulting in the rather odd bonding of Charlie and George.<br /><br />  A few days later, some film arrives at the photo kiosk to be developed. Both Charlie and George look through the developed prints and learn something: they are to kill each other.<br /><br />  Turns out Charlie and George are both spies.<br /><br />  From that point on, Wolstencroft weaves a marvelous tale.

In \\"All The Flowers Are Dying,\\" Block has a great story and he tells it perfectly.<br /><br />  The dustjacket says this is Block's sixteenth Matthew Scudder. I vaguely recall reading one or two of the series. Now I question why my recall is vague: Matthew Scudder in this novel is a fully formed character. He has aged during the series and much of the appeal of the book rests on Scudder's human failings and the recognition of his aging and mortality.<br /><br />  Scudder and his wife are targets of a terrifyingly imaginative serial killer. The serial killer is painted in shadowy detail as the story progresses. There is no shortage of suspects in Scudder's eyes as the bodies pile up. Which of them is the murderer? Is Scudder's beloved wife in danger? How close is the danger? Block keeps you guessing.<br /><br />  Block moves the story along beautifully. There are few sentences that break the reader's absorption. And the ending is very well done.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-03-22

His plot devices almost always come as surprises. Nearly always, Phillips manages the story beautifully, never quite explaining, but never quite leaving the reader mystified.<br /><br />  All in all, a wonderful read and a superb mystery of a kind rarely seen today.

But  nearly all revisionists are lightweight leftist intellectuals who try to cast the United States as the penultimate villain.<br /><br />  Max Hastings, on the other hand, is a revisionist, but his revisions have to do with correcting some of the propagandist lies that arose after the end of war in Europe in 1945.<br /><br />  The politics of the time demanded that the American, English and other western \\"allies\\" be accorded great credit for the military victory while the newly re-demonized Soviet Union's part be minimized.<br /><br />  Hastings has performed a heroic deed in \\"Armageddon\\" by reminding the world once again that the Soviet Union, as evil as its government was, played the grand role in destoying the German war machine.<br /><br />  The American military is accurately depicted as a miracle of rapid organization and promiscuous user of technology. The British come off as a plodding, ultimately poorly led and rapidly diminishing army. The Poles, Canadians and few French barely count. Overall Hastings carefully explains how the democracies built war time armies that reflected their peoples: war was a job to be done, something to be finished as quickly as possible so soldiers could return home to their normal lives. The approach hampered military operations for the western allies since no American or British soldier wanted to be the last to die. Thus, Hastings argues, the advance of the allies east into Germany was constantly hampered by delays. None of the American, British or Canadian generals come off particularly well in Hasting's estimation . . . and as most students of history would tell you, he is right.<br /><br />  The German army, according to Hastings, was the finest of the WWII armies, perhaps the finest in history. And as you read Hasting's account how the Germans staved off defeat with ad hoc forces, often brilliant improvisation on the battlefield and a ruthless disdain for human life and western morality, you breathe a sigh of relief that Germany was once again defeated (though it would have been so much better if Germany's aggression had been forcefully addresse earlier).<br /><br /> It is the Soviet military that comes off as the true engineer of victory of WWII in Europe and this is, as almost any student of military history will tell you, true. The Soviet Union ruled by Lenin and then Stalin is seeped in more blood and outright evil than Hitler's Germany, yet it was capable of creating a military machine that killed 2 million German soldiers before the western allies set foot in France. The Soviet generals (and Stalin) proved far more adaptable than the Americans and British in devising strategic and tactical approaches to defeating the Germans. This is all the more amazing when, as Hastings does, Soviet society is considered. A truly repressed people in peace and war, the Soviets were able to organize not only manpower, but industrial production as well. Soviet losses were apalling: German behavior toward conquered Soviets even more appalling. Yet out of some spirit of patriotism for Mother Russia, ordinary Soviet citizens endured tremendous sacrifices on every level to roll back the Germans.<br /><br />  Personally I felt no pity for Hastings' recounting of the disaster that befell German civilians. Germany brought upon itself the destruction it so freely visited upon others. Hastings makes the point that far too many Germans who should have been executed as war criminals were never brought to justice because of post-war politics. That is a great shame.<br /><br />  Every self-proclaimed pacifist should read this book simply to learn how fragile freedom is and what happens when well intentioned, but thoroughly ignorant people, allow evil to flourish. Students of history, on the other hand, will find \\"Armageddon\\" satisfying because it is one of the few WWII histories free of political bias.<br /><br />  Max Hastings has proven himself to be one of the very best military historians of the 20th Century's greatest and hopefully last \\"world war.\\"<br /><br />Jerryw WWII histories free of political bias. <br /> <br />  Max Hastings has proven himself to be one of the very best military historians of the 20th Century's greatest and hopefully last \\"world war.\\" <br /> <br />Jerry	2005-03-10

The story is really a mishmash of pseudoscientists trying to harness Charlotte's semi-psychic abilities, a decades old spat between Cherokees and a local family, a dark spot in Charlotte's and the public defender who rescued and then married her. Throw in a psychotic daughter, a son who magically appears, a direct line to the FBI's head and a few other odds and ends and you have it all.<br /><br />  The story is stilted to a large degree, depending on contrivances to move the plot forward. There is never any real suspense, but Hall is still readable.<br /><br />  My suggestion is to put this one on the list for when there's nothing else you really want to read.

While Monroe is of interest only to those concerned with popular culture, the body of writing that has accumulated around her personna, real or imagined, merits investigation.<br /><br />  Unfortunately Churchwell, restrained by all the current strictures of political correctness, is not up to the task. Most glaringly, she cites so-called feminist authors whose politics are clearly fascistic without comment, while never failing to call out any even remotely conservative author as \\"right-wing.\\"<br /><br />  The stink of political correctness and academic hypocrisy permeates virtually every page. In every chapter, save one, Churchwell is the slave of academic orthodoxy. The single exception is the final chapter, \\"Afterword: My Marilyn.\\" Clearly a personal narrative, Churchwell paints an engaging, perceptive of Marilyn Monroe.<br /><br />  Many trees would have been saved had Churchwell simply published the one chapter and left the rest for an author with greater freedom to express their opinions.

The plot twists a bit too far to drive home the danger of enviro-fanatics.<br /><br />  But to an open minded reader, Chricton will make his point: global warming is about deluded people who are manipulated by people greedy for money, power or both.<br /><br />  Chricton includes appendices which are compelling reading for anyone interested in truth --- a quality notably lacking in many of the global warming fanatics.<br /><br />Jerry	2005-02-21

David Zucchino has written a timeless account of the armored strikes that effectively captured Baghdad. Called \\"thunder runs,\\" the idea was to thrust an armoured column into Baghdad with such force and violence that tyhe enemy could not resist and would know that the Americans could go where they want, when they wanted.<br /><br />  The first Thunder Run was through the suburbs of Baghdad to the main airport. Zucchino does a superlative job of describing the mishaps, mistakes, lost opportunities and fear attendant to any military operation. One can only marvel at the courage and resourcefulness of the men assigned this task.<br /><br />  The second Thunder Run was to be to the center of Baghdad just to broadcast to the Iraqis that, indeed, American forces could drive right into the heart of the government center, sweeping aside any opposition.<br /><br />  The commander of the operation felt it could go further: that the armored column could not only penetrate to the heart of Baghdad - but stay there as well. This would, it was argued, end the war.<br /><br />  Zucchino distinguishes himself as one of the finest narrators of war in this generation. His descriptions of the frantic Iraqi counter-attacks, the confusion, the almost random nature of death in combat run right to the heart.<br /><br />  Happily, Zuchhino leave politics at the doorstep.

Griffin is, in my opinion, the finest military adventure writer on the planet. In \\"By Order of the President,\\" Griffin catapaults himself into the near future with a believeable story of a splinter terrorist group. Like today's Al Queada, this shadowy group has no identifiable state sponsor and aims that reflect the grotesqtuely nightmarish beliefs that we see plastered all too frequently in the mainstream media. (\\"Vote for democracy and we will kill you.\\")<br /><br />Charley Castillo is a new Griffin character. Through family connections (a regular plot device for Griffin) and his own abilities, he has attracted attention as he climbed the military ladder. A Delta Force major, he is chosen by the President to find out why the intelligence agencies seem unable to locate a stolen 727 aircraft. Thus the \\"By Order of the President.\\"<br /><br />Like Fleming Pickering, the hero of another Griffin series, Castillo has the authority to go anywhere and do anything in the course of his duty. It's a convenient plot device and one suspects Griffin might be lost without it. And we are all the better for Griffin's use of it. In other hands, it could easily lead (as it so often does) to utterly implausible plots and transparent characters.<br /><br />But Griffin has a sure hand and Castillo moves from one locale to another as he unravels the mystery, which if unstopped could have deadly consequences to the resdidents of Philadelphia.<br /><br />Griffin is unsparing in his ridicule of the CIA and FBI. Whether this is justified or not, I don't know. But Griffin has definitely taken aim at both agencies and draws sharp portraits of their leaders as buffoons.<br /><br />Griffin's plots are always tight and his characters have substantial depth, many of them becoming friends over the course of reading his many series novels.<br /><br />For Griffin fans, \\"By Order of the President\\" will be a delight, though many (like me) wonder why he is branching out into a new set of characters instead of continuing on with the old. Maybe he's just grown bored with them. For those new Griffin, armed with a taste for adventure, Griffin mayt very well keep you awake for a night or two as you find the novel impossible to put down.<br /><br />Jerryof characters instead of continuing on with the old.

Paul's brother is started on a long path of incarceration, being blamed for the shooting death of the boyfriend.<br /><br />  Paul joins the fire department and is haunted by the ghost of his father, a firefighter killed in a fire 19 years before. His father's death precipitated his mother's slide into depression and alcoholism.<br /><br />  Paul is loner in the fire department. Moved from the station to station (the result of punching out a chief), he doesn't make friends. He doesn't want friends.<br /><br />  Seattle is swamped with a wave of arsons. Paul cannot stop thinking of his father who died in an arsonist's fire. Possessed of a violent temper and physical strength and skill, Wolff is not a man to be tinkered with. But he is brave, honest and compassionate.<br /><br />  A host of disordered characters populate these pages. Eddings, the lesbian battalion chief who has it in for female probationer Cindy Rideout, whom Wolff has taken under his wing. Slaughter, commander of the other squad in the station house who seems to have it in for Paul Wolff. Hertlein, the bullying chief knocked out by Paul, whose sanity seems in question.<br /><br />  And then there's Earl Ward, the arsonist who has returned to Seattle after 25 years in prison.<br /><br />  Not everyone in the book is wacko. But the exceptions are few.<br /><br />  Emerson's characters are richly drawn: they are believable and for the most part, frightening. His plot rolls along without a single hiccup.<br /><br />  Emerson's universe is weird, but engrossing.<br /><br />Jerry	2004-12-18

Or should I say compelling, interesting police procedurals? I've read others along the way, but until I discovered John Sandford's \\"Prey\\" series, I found them trite and boring for the most part.<br /><br />  Now with my discovery of Stuart M. Kaminsky and his Abe Lieberman character, I admit to becoming a fan.<br /><br />  Abe Lieberman is a 60-ish Chicago detective. I should note that this is Kaminsky's eigth Lieberman book, so presumably he started the series with a younger man.<br /><br />  Lieberman is no superman. He has ordinary problems like high cholesterol, insomnia and an adult daughter who can't find happiness, so blames her father for her unhappiness.<br /><br />  The story begins with Lieberman in Yuma, Arizona, about to escourt a prisoner back to Chicago. An elderly black airport janitor kills Lieberman's prisoner at the boarding gate - and we're off to a cop's life.<br /><br />  Hannrahan, Abe's partner, is an Irish Catholic, a reformed alcoholic, with a second wife. In Lieberman's absence, Hannrahan is teamed with O'Neill, who appears to be extreme racist.<br /><br />  Life's misfortunes provide the cloud through which these men. Elderly Jews gathering at Leiberman's brother's delicatessen; a bunch of kids who get their kicks beating and finally murdering and raping women on the street; a demented young man who happily sets out to kill a rising celebrity. It's all part of day's work for Lieberman and his colleagues.<br /><br />  Several stories at once flow in the narrative and Kaminsky keeps them all straight, never missing a beat, never forcing the reader to suspend credulity.<br /><br />  Kaminsky and Lieberman have a new fan.<br /><br />Jerry	2004-12-11

For most people, WWI is remote and incomprehensible, its origions linked to imperial expansion and monarchies. It is difficult, if not impossible, for modern people to relate to such an environment.<br /><br />  Through the fictional narrative of several real people, both major and minor players in the actual event, Jeff Shaara does a wonderful job of explaining the era, the causes of an idiotic war, the naivete of the people doing the actual fighting and dying and the corruption of the European leaders who couldn't stop the monster their own stupidity created.<br /><br />  For anyone trying to grasp early 20th  Century history, this is a must read. For those familiar with the period, it is a masterful recounting of the era through the pen of a master of historical fiction.<br /><br />Jerry	2004-12-11

Put aside credulity, ignore the unbelievability of the characters and the strained plots and just enjoy.<br /><br />  With the addition of Dirk Cussler, his son, to Clive's writing stable, things have dramatically - and for the better.<br /><br />  This Dirk Pitt novel, which amusingly revolves around Dirk Pitt, Jr.(and his sister), is the best yet. The plot is tight, the loose ends nicely tucked in. The characters while still their infatiguable, indomitable selves, are a bit more solid.<br /><br />  The plot is a doozy. The Japanese attempt biological attacks on the United States during WWII. The submarines carrying the weaposn are sunk. A nefarious scheme is hatched to recover their lethal payloads some 60 years later for another attack on the U.S. Prominent Americans are assasinated in Japan and Korea. Two Coast Guardsmen mysteriously die on a remote Aleutian Island. And it keeps getting more involved.<br /><br />  This book simply zips along.

Many great writers tried for one more big hit and failed.<br /><br />  As a Follett fan who has thrilled to his many fine novels, I have to admit my disappointment at this boring, predictable and dull attempt at a thriller.<br /><br />  Former female cop, who left the force under a cloud because of her personal relationship with another cop, is working at a biochemical firm owned by wealthy eccentric scientist. A technicisan who has succumbed to the animals are human cult steals an animal, which is infected with a deadly disease. Cop detects theft, finds lab worker dead.

An intelligent child of an ordinary couple, she is blessed with formidable intelligence, teachers who believe in her and cursed with a very limited view of the world. She has one friend her own age and feels shunned by her classmates, especially the boys, because she is different.<br /><br />  Charlotte receives a full-scholarship to the fictional DuPont University, a composite of Ivy League schools.<br /><br />  She seeks intellectual companionship, to live in a world of the mind. And be attractive to boys. But she just doesn't fit in with her Southern mountain country dialect, her strict religiously oriented upbringing and a general lack of what passes these days as wordly sophistication.<br /><br />  In her first few months, Charlotte reaches highs of intellectual stimulation and ambition when her Nobel laureate neuroscience professor praises her work and plumbs the depths of depression when a frivolous frat boy deflowers her.<br /><br />  Wolfe's writing is, as always, superb. The story plays on several levels: the vanity of over-privileged, under-cultured college students; the stupidity of university political correctness; the bizarre emphasis put on college athletics. Through Charlotte, we view all of this through the eyes of a child-woman who desperately wants to be noticed, wants to fit in, but doesn't want to yield an inch from her already conceived view of the world.<br /><br />  Wolfe inteweaves several stories at once. The aspiring nerd jouurnalist, Adam Gellin, who is hopelessly in love with Charlotte, but never quite gets his fantasies realized. Hoyt Thorpe, the airheaded frat boy who sees in himself the world's macho; Jojo Johannson, the athlete in whom Charlotte accidentally sparks a desire to learn.<br /><br />  \\"I Am Charlotte Simmons\\" is a metaphor for everyone who has ever been an alert 18 year old in a world where you think there are rules, but haven't yet realized that there really aren't and even if there were, you wouldn't want to play by them.<br /><br />  Wolfe is a master and Charlotte Simmons does not disappoint.

But it does not slip into irrelevance merely because - as Hewitt predicted - Kerry would lose, before he was nominated.<br /><br />  The book has value to anyone who thinks Democrats must be kept from higher office.

But his almost brilliantly complex plot is his undoing in \\"The Murder Artist.\\"<br /><br />  The beginning is electrifying and horrifying: reporter Alex Callahan's 6 year old twins are kidnapped, literally before his eyes.<br /><br />  The police strike out and after several weeks, Callahan decides to pursue the kidnapper on his own. Nice move - but it doesn't work.<br /><br />  Callahan travels across the nation piecing the story together from a disparate set of clues. If only the plot hadn'st become so complex, it might have worked.<br /><br />  But each layer of complexity renders the story less and less believable. The action becomes strained and soon you're just turning the pages without any real involvement. Kind of like sitting through the preliminaries at a tall tales contest.<br /><br />  The ending is so strained that there's no sense of drama or relief. You're just glad the story is finished.<br /><br />  It's not really a bad book: Case is far too skilled a writer for that. And it's not really boring. It's just not a compelling read.<br /><br />Jerry	2004-11-15

A Minnesota cop, Davenport is intelligent, resourceful,street tough and takes pleasure in his work.

As Davenport gets into the case, things get complex fast. Drugs are involved. Drug dealing and some very clever people doing the dealing.<br /><br />  Sandford does a remarkable job of never getting stuck in the ruts of his own plots. Sure, they're similar in a small way from one novel to another, but always sufficiently different to draw the reader in. And Davenport keeps growing as a person in different ways.<br /><br />  \\"Easy Prey\\" is another great novel from Sandford.<br /><br />Jerry	2004-11-15

Since her youth, she has been entirely absorbed with herself. In college, like many true believers described by Eric Hoffer, the emptiness of her own mind and life is filled by devotion to a cause. In Hannah's case, it is the SDS and Weathermen. Definitely not a leader and not a well-disciplined follower, Hannah plays a small role in the Weater underground's assault on democracy. For this she is indicted and, too cowardly to face the consequences of her actions, hides out.<br /><br />  On a lark, she and a fellow-traveler take off for Africa. Since Hannah is incapable of forming real relationships with other people, she splits from her comrade Zack and winds up in Liberia - where the real story begins.<br /><br />  Hannah meets a minor functionary in the Liberian government, weds him, bears him three children and, coincidentally, works for a sleazy project using chimpanzees for ersatz medical research.<br /><br />  Banks paints a chilling portrait of Liberia and its repulsive politics. There's the usual anti-American, anti-capitalist rant, but Banks fails to convince that these are the causes of Liberia's ruthless dictatorships, poverty and mass mayhem.<br /><br />  Through it all, Hannah remains blissfully self-absorbed. Love her husband? Well, not really. Love her children? Sort of, in a kind of detached way. Hannah returns to the US just in time to see that her mother - in Hannah's eyes - is a total ditz and watch her father die. Does she feel devestated? Well, not really: you see, she really wasn't close to her father.<br /><br />  Zack, her fellow escapee, shows up again at the apartment of Hannah's previous woman lover. Together they help a jailed Liberian opposition politician escape from a US prison. Hannah, of course, believes he will bring socialism to Liberia.<br /><br />  Hannah returns to Africa, her exile rescinded by Liberia's current leader. She is liberated now and tells her husband that she doesn't want the housemaid/mistress living with them any longer; tells her three boys that they must wash their own clothes and announces that she is founding a chimpanzee sanctuary.<br /><br />  Needless to say, reality closes in with Liberia's civil war. Well, one of Liberia's many civil wars. Hannah's husband is beheaded before the family's eyes; the three boys run off and Hannah is told by the CIA that she was duped into helping the Liberian rebel escape from prison and must flee.<br /><br />  Hannah ends up owning an upstate New York farm and, once more, returns to Africa, seeking her sons and herself.

Grant is remarkably spare, a mere 158 pages in a compact 6 x 9 page format no less.<br /><br />  But in those few pages, Korda paints a picture of greatness. Perhaps it is to the lasting credit of Grant that his life could be painted in broad strokes with only selected details.<br /><br />  Grant was a youth with few outstanding qualities aside from horsemanship. A mediocre student, he attends West Point, fights in the war with Mexico and is essentially cashiered from the Army.<br /><br />  He spends years in obscurity until the Civil War where his true and natural calling as a leader of men and great armies becomes evident.<br /><br />  He becomes President not so much from poiitical ambition, but from a desire for a job. Korda makes it clear that while not one of the very greatest Presidents, Grant deserves more credit than he has gotten.<br /><br />  Grant comes across as a great man, a great American, from a time when natural genius could flourish, rather than be buried in our credential happy society.

Just as Robert Ludlum writes from the grave, Cussler permits others to write in his name. In this case, the co-author, given small billing on the cover, is Craig Dirgo.<br /><br />  The most notable feature of this attempt at imitating Cussler is the obsession with food. Every few pages, one of the paper-thin, utterly boring characters pours coffee, makes a sandwich, orders from room service or does something with food. I can't understand why. Even as a device for the idea starved author, the food obsession makes no sense.<br /><br />  Of course, nothing in this wannabe thriller makes sense. The plot appears constructed from an adaptation of those refrigeraor magnets. Kind of like a series of \\"exciting\\" plot twists and action scenes were mixed up on the refrigerator door and then plucked one by one to create this excruciatingly thrilless thriller.<br /><br />  To make a long, dreadful story short, a archaeologist financed by a shadowy billionaire discovers a meteorite in Greenland or someplace around there.

Wow, mix a few terrorists in and a murky vengenace mission by the wacky billionaire and what do you have? An opportunity for the Corporation, a private counter-terrorism business, to get involved.<br /><br />  Clive Cussler could have done wonders with these concepts.

Walter Duranty of The New York Times wrote extensively of the Soviet Union and even won a Lenin Prize for his efforts. Duranty, it was learned after millions died of starvation, was a self-serving liar who simply denied the truth about famine in the Ukraine and deliberately misinformed the American public. Randal, in my opinion, is probably in line for some kind of award from the French government.<br /><br />  This book is not about the making of a terrorist: it is about how the United States and its perfidious Jewish agents in Israel forced poor Osama to murder.<br /><br />  Randal casts himself as an intrepid foreign correspondent, subjecting himself to great danger in search of the story. In Algeria,he says \\"[m]ost pale-skinned Westerners had long since departed Algeria . . .,\\" but not Randal whose \\"only protection was a street-smart taxi driver.\\" The self-adulation is enough to cause gagging.<br /><br />  Perhaps the worst part of Randal's tome is his use of the Washington Post and New York Times for his citations. Thus the hoary myth that deGaulle waved off photos of Soviet missiles in Cuba with \\"The word of the President of the United States is good enough for me\\" is repeated based on a false anecdote reported in the Washington Post.<br /><br />  In the end, all would be right if Bush weren't President, if the State of Israel ceased to exist and France were obeyed at all times. This is, in the end, a pathetically ill-informed projection of the ego of a man who thinks he is far more important than he ever was or will be.<br /><br />Jerry	2004-10-30

Political satire is one thing: this is not political satire. Thrillers may be based on outlandish plots and characters, but they should not be based on palpable lies.<br /><br />  This so-called political thriller might play well among left-leaning academics and pseudo-intellectuals who believe Communism would have succeeded if only a few hundred more people were enslaved or murdered by implementing the revolution.<br /><br />  Everything the left considers evil from fast-food to the environment is trotted out in the first couple of chapters along with some outright lies believed so fervently by the far-left.<br /><br />  The plot is mundane. Billionaire invoved in a conspiracy to steal the presidential election. All the bad people are rich.

Franklin Delano Roosevelt was a great man, a unparalleled politician and an effective President. He was also unscrupulous, ruthless, petty in many ways, unfaithful to his wife and his own promises and callous when it came to the lives of millions.<br /><br />  Roosevelt's imperfections as man were part of him and, in my estimation, make him even more admirable for all the good he did accomplish.<br /><br />  \\"Nothing To Fear\\" demans Roosevelt because it distorts the man and lies about his deeds in order to iconize him all the more.<br /><br />  For example, Gallagher is at pains to describe Roosevelt's promise to his wife never to see his mistress Lucy Mercer again. Gallagher then omits the fact that Mercer was at Roosevelt's side when he died and was whisked away by the Secret Service. Eleanor Roosevelt was crushed when she learned this.<br /><br />  Gallagher attributes to Roosevelt many things he did not do and fails to critically note many things Roosevelt did do that ultimately caused pain, even death, to many.<br /><br />  The photos in this book, which are supposed to be the centerpiece, are often miscaptioned.<br /><br />  The poltiical correctness is overwhelming. \\"Persons of short stature, 'little people,' often subject to social stigma, became valued workers in aircraft factories\\" reads one caption. \\"Americans of all colos and creeds worked side by side in the war effort\\" reads another, conveniently forgetting race riots in Detroit, Los Angeles and elsewhere.<br /><br />  The book has the feel of something intended for children. Children should not be lied to. Nor should anyone else. For all his foibles and failings, Roosevelt was a great man: he needs no apologists and liars.<br /><br />Jerry	2004-10-30

It's not a genre I was particularly interested in. But I picked up one of his \\"Prey\\" novels out of desperation for engrossing fiction. I've now read about six or so of the \\"Prey\\" series.<br /><br />  Lucas Davenport is one of the best-developed fictional characters to be found. He is human. He is an imperfect man in search of justice. He is smart, but not a genius. Sometimes he loses battles on his way to winning the war. And perhaps best of all, Davenport grows a bit, changes a bit in each \\"Prey\\" novel.<br /><br />  In \\"Hidden Prey,\\" Davenport has to resolve a series of murders. The first involves a Russian, so a Russian investigator joins Minnesotan Davenport on the case.<br /><br />  Sandford's plots are beautifully constructed. I haven't found a one yet that required a suspension of belief, not a one that jarred a reader's senses.<br /><br />  Sandford is simply a master and a delightful read.<br /><br />Jerry	2004-10-25

It's been that way for more than a century and will probably never change. Robert Cooley is obviously a brave man. He put his life at risk to expose corruption. Though he was once part of that corruption, he ultimately saw that the evil needed to be fought.<br /><br />  That said, the book is disappointing. The writing style is flat and there is far too much focus on Cooley's childhood and personal life. Opportunities are missed time and time again to bring the corrosive effects of political and judicial corruption into sharper relief. Excursions into the impact of mob murders, fixed court cases and the like would have been welcome. Particularly for people who don't live in Chicago, the impact of Cooley's bravery on the people of the city may be lost.<br /><br />  That said, Cooley's book is still worthwhile for demonstrating how a few dishonorable men can steal the life and wealth of a great city.<br /><br />Jerry	2004-10-08

I've read four so far and each has been an adventure.<br /><br />  Lucas Davenport is a Minnesota cop, with the City of Minneapolis in early \\"Prey\\" novels, the State of Minnesota in later ones.<br /><br />  The plot is almost beside the point.

One night, they tape a raid by animal activists. Coincidentally a call comes in that someone is on a hotel window ledge and may jump. Anna's crew records the jump.<br /><br />  Hours later, someone murders a member of Anna's crew and off we go into the pursuit of a crazed killer who is obsessed with Anna.<br /><br />  Ho-hum. The characters are thin, the plot contrived and the novel interminable. It's not a total waste of time, but there are many other cop-novels out there that are far more enjoyable, including Sandford's own \\"Prey\\" series, which I highly recommend.<br /><br />Jerry	2004-10-07

Bush	Books	1	8	40	N	N	Thinly veiled partisan bile	\\"Evan Cornog's masterful new look at the American presidency explores the ways our presidents craft persuasive personal narratives and how their storytelling can capture the public imagination and build the support necessary to govern,\\" exclaims the flyleaf. In reality, this is an object lesson in how the disingenuous journalist can craft their stories to appear as scholarly research when, in fact, they are just old fashioned partisan campaigning.<br /><br />  Cornog's book should serve as a warning to anyone who believes the media are \\"objective\\": Cornog is an associate dean for plannig and policy at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism and publisher of the Columbian Journalism Review.<br /><br />  My copy of \\"Power and the Story\\" is now loaded with slips of paper, each bookmarking a lie or distortion in Cornog's campaign tract. Cornog claims that the old Soviet Union was an American stereotype rooted in habitual ignorance or modern prejudice. Just what does Cornog find admirable about the old Soviet Union? Its gulag system? Its forced exile of minorities? Like others who apparently felt that acceptance of the Soviet Union was the right thing, Cornog casts Ronald Reagan's declaration of the Soviet Union as a message \\"inadequate to the complexities of the world.\\" Why do people like Cornog come out and specifically say what was good and admirable about the Soviet Union?<br /><br />  In Cornog's view, Lyndon Johnson embodied the Texas Populist Tradition while George W. Bush is rooted in the Conferdate past. The single tenuous reference to support this theory is to yet another overtly partisan screed. This reminds me of Stalin citing Lenin as a persuasive authority.<br /><br />  Time after time, Cornog bases his assertions on the assertions of other partisan and sometimes thoroughly discredited sources such as Joseph Wilson whose partisan claims were debunked by investigative committees on both sides of the Atlantic. But such minor details cannot deter a rabid partisan like Cornog from his appointed rounds. He is a part of the journalistic community, where truth is apparently the first casualty.<br /><br />  In the final analysis, Cornog offers sophmoric history of how - big surprise - Presidential campaigns weave legends around their candidate and how history distorts them. He pays no attention to how determined such posthumous efforts can be, as in the case of John F. Kennedy. All of his contemporary sketches are clearly skewed: Democrats are all saintly, Republicans evil.<br /><br />  In all, this is just another anti-Bush rant. What makes it disturbing is that the author is someone who apparently is an \\"educator\\" of future journalists. With Cornog's work as an example, we can whistle goodbye to whatever shreds of honesty and objectivity remain in journalism.<br /><br />Jerrya rabid partisan like Cornog from his appointed rounds.

His main characters are minor players in the storm sweeping down upon them.

And human is a keyword here, for Furst's characters are human.<br /><br />  The plots of a Furst novel become secondary, I think, after you've read several. This one is about an attempt to stop the flow of Roumanian oil to Germany. It can't be faulted.<br /><br />  But the plot in a Furst novel isn't really important.

Four hundred of its 403 pages are a pure delight. Taut, gut-wrenching, can't put it down thriller. The last three pages, unfortunately, take a lot of the wind out of the sails. They don't ruin the experience: just kind of diminish it.<br /><br />  Alan Craik finds himself in Kenya, sneaking a gun through customs while his colleague, a female special Navy Criminal Investigation agent blows through customs carrying drugs. A naval vessel making a port call is bombed and Craik is very much in the middle of things.<br /><br />  Kent is a superb writer; no doubt about that. He relentlessly builds the tension as the tentacles of an international plot envelop his wife, an astronaut in training in Houston and a Carrier Battle Group.<br /><br />  There are no flaws in the characters. The good guys and gals are good: humans, not super-heroes. Sometimes they catch a lucky break or think their ways through a dicey situation. Sometimes things don't work out and they wind up very dead. Above all, they are believable. You suck in your breath when they're in a tight spot - and there are lots of tight spots.<br /><br />  The bad guys are believably evil- and you hope they'll all suffer for their evil ways.<br /><br />  The plotting is just plain great. Nothing unbelievable, no jars that make you swallow your credulity. Except for the last three pages. I don't know if Kent needed to keep some characters alive for another book (many of the characters have appeared in his other novels) or if an editor slipped or what. But the last three pages just don't fit with the rest of the story.<br /><br />  But that shouldn't stop you from reading it, if you're a lover of thrillers. Like I said, this a five-star story. The only reason I knocked it down is because of the last three pages. Still a very enjoyable read.<br /><br />Jerry	2004-09-29

An assasin without a name, but with his own set of psychological problems is murdering everyone in an Al Queda cell as he works his way to his final quarry. Guess who?<br /><br />  I refer to attempted thrillers like these as \\"Lego books\\": it's as if the author reached into a bucket of Lego blocks, each inscribed with a cliche of dialog or plot twist and put together his novel.<br /><br />  The prime movers here are simply unbelievable. The cleverer-than-thou assassin able to disappear in an instant. The dumber-than-dumb CIA operative who can't see the obvious. All the characters are thinner than paper. The plot twists are clearly inventions arrived at to move the author over rough spots.<br /><br />  All in all not a very satisfying read. Not a horrible read, but not one that leaves you breathless, interested or awake.le<br /><br />Jerry	2004-09-09

The publisher she is to meet with is murdered by a pair of nasties. Soon enough we are involved with the inner workings of several British police and intelligence agencies, a bunch of terrorists, a turncoat Brit nursing a grudge and the CIA. There is the grizzled old pro, Peter Ashton; the beleaguered director; the wannabes and perky analyst working her way up the ladder.<br /><br />  Not an awful read, but definitely pedestrian. The characters despite the earnest efforts of the author never take on any depth. The plot twists and turns, but not in a way that excites. No sitting on the edge of your seat here.

Clearly the authors have never visited the property.<br /><br />  Other properties get two or three paragraph descriptions, all of which sound as if they were lifted from press releases or property brochures.<br /><br />  Overall, there doesn't seem to be any evidence that the authors are actually familiar with any of the places they describe or recommend.

Ms. Simontacchi appears to be such a person.<br /><br />  It doesn't take much for the critical reader to see that the author has either little understanding of science or chooses to mask whatever understanding they have in order to sell their book.<br /><br />  For example, Simontacchi writes \\"At the turn ofo the century, heart disease was so rare that many physicians had never treated a heart patient.\\" This is true, but Simontacchi fails to point out the reason: most people didn't live long enough to develop heart disease. Life expectancy for white males born in 1850 was 38.3 years; for those born in 1900, it was 48 years. A white male born today can look forward to a probably life expectancy of 75 years. In short, the frequency of heart disease today has much more to do with overall improvements in controlling disease and litle to do with what we eat.<br /><br />  As Ben Wattenberg pointed out years ago, the \\"epidemics\\" of cancer and heart disease is the \\"good news\\": people are living long enough to develop them.<br /><br />  Simontachhi's fantasizing of a \\"healthier\\" past is also evident in another statement: \\"[o]ur great-gandparents mostly drank water out of the well or the swift-flowing stream. Indeed: and they also died in droves of cholera and typhus. Again, this has nothing to do with food. It is an attempt to sell fear and nothing more.<br /><br />  As ix typical of junk science tomes, Simontacchi provides many bibliographic references. However, even a superficial examination indicates that many of these so-called sources may be biased, unscientific or simply be the same sort of junk science the author is peddling. For example: \\"Aspartame is, by far, the most dangerous substance on the market that is added to foods.\\" The source of this damning statement? The Aspartame Consumer Safety Network, whatever that may be. Such groups are often controlled by trial lawyers and fearmongers who stand to profit by their activities.<br /><br />  There is no shortage of examples which at least put the \\"science\\" of Ms. Simontacchi's claims in grave doubt.

In \\"Dark Voyage,\\" Furst weaves a story beginning with Dutch merchant ship Captain Eric DeHaan. His Dutch homeland has been overrun by the German Army. The war rages around him. Britain is losing hundreds of merchant ships to German submarines and bombers. Something must be done.<br /><br />  The stateless DeHaan, his ship and crew are more or less conscripted into the service of British intelligence. None are spies or soldiers by trade: they are among the millions of innocents whose lives are put at risk in the service of an idea: freedom.<br /><br />  The first mission requires disguising DeHaan's freighter, the Noordendam, as the Spanish flagged Santa Rosa for a clandestine raid.<br /><br />  Furst is an artist with his words. He deftly paints portraits of DeHaan, his crew, the British operatives with few words, but the impressions are strong. The action flows seamlessly. A refugee Jew is brought aboard to serve as the ship's doctor. A Soviet journalist on the run from Stalin's secret police joins this band of survivors.<br /><br />  Next is another mission, a dangerous run to Sweden.<br /><br />  Furst's mastery never fails. There isn't a single hiccup in the plot; none of the characters fails to involve the reader.<br /><br />  There are no super-human heroics here. Just the story of a small group of men and women who are caught up in the maelstrom of war and attempt to do whatever little they can in the fight for freedom.<br /><br />  I for one read the last page of \\"Dark Voyage\\" and had that immediate longing for characters that I had grown fond of - and wanted to know more about.

Not a superman and certainly not an oppressed cog in the great game, Rain has left Japan for Brazil where his former employer seeks him out for a project.<br /><br />  For John Rain, gainful employment means that one or more people shuffle off their mortal coil. The corpses are plentiful, nearly all of them dispatched after short exposure to Rain's martial arts skills. The idea of finding a hired killer likeable may seem a stetch for some, but Eisler's John Rain is likeable, even if he does kill easily and often.<br /><br />  Rain finds himself in Macau, needing only to terminate a certain Belghazi in order to collect a substantial paycheck.<br /><br />  Of course things don't go smoothly. There are bodyguards, a mysterious blonde, an old buddy from Afghanistan and enough twists and turns to make a mountain goat nauseous.<br /><br />  But Eisler never fails.

How could one man, like a Stalin, Hitler or Mao, become and remain the center of a powerful state? Montefiore does not directly trace Stalin's rise to power and the reader would be well-advised to have sufficient knowledge of the origins of the Soviet Union and its history before approaching this book.<br /><br />  The Soviet leaders of Stalin's era relied heavily upon the written word and Montefiore has taken advantage of the opening o the fallen empire's archives for much of his source material. He has also interview survivors of the era and in some cases their children or grandchildren.<br /><br />  He paints a chilling picture. Stalin, according to Montefiore, was not a slobbering maniac, but an intelligent autodidact and Marxist fanatic who could be charming and generous while consigning millions, including his intimates, to imprisonment, torture and death.<br /><br />  Montefiore strips away the stereotypes of Stalin I learned as an American child during the Cold War. The tyrant is presented as a man of cunning, intelligence and ruthlessness. Those around him, mostly men, ranged from the criminally stupid to the intelligent. Few of Stalin's circle survived: not a one didn't live in constant fear of him.<br /><br />  Montefiore has made an important contribution to understanding the pathology of mass movements and individual fear. A marvelous, extraordinary history. Anne Applebaum's Gulag would be an excellent companion volume. But again, if you don't have at least a basic underpinning of Soviet history, study it before you tackle either of these histories.<br /><br />(...)	2004-08-08

Burrough describes how FBI agents had to leave their posts to find payphones to telephone in their progress reports.<br /><br />  As a part of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal - and to justify the intrusion of the federal government into state and local affairs - the FBI was given the task of bringing these \\"Public Enemies\\" to \\"justice.\\"<br /><br />  The egomanical J. Edgar Hoover and his agents had as little respect for the law as the bank robbers and kidnappers they pursued. And they were no more competent.<br /><br />  Burrough catalogs the often tragic comedy of errors as the embryonic FBI chased their targets. Agents had to learn how to shoot, how to conduct surveillance, how to collate information. In short, most often it was dumb luck that resulted in the apprehension - and often summary execution - of the \\"most wanted.\\"<br /><br />  The FBI's tactics included kidnapping, secret detention and possibly physical abuse.<br /><br />  The press, no brighter in those days than now, played the events like a ping-pong ball, alternately praising the criminals and than lionizing law enforcement.<br /><br />  Burrough pays attention to the details. He has no favorites here. And, when all is said, the reader probably won't either.<br /><br />Jerry	2004-08-08

A custodian responsible for one Great Uncle's palace swimming pools is hanged because the chlorine isn't properly adjusted. Great Uncle's son is depicted as a sadistic monster. Does all this sound familiar?<br /><br />  Alan Sheriff has Anglicized his name while he sits in a refugee detention camp. Bit by bit, he tells his story to a writer who has befriended him.<br /><br />  Once noted as an upcoming writer in his native land, Sheriff tells the story of life under Great Uncle. He and his wife, a successful film and television actress, keep company with a salon of the nation's artists and writers. Great Uncle tells the producer of his wife's soap opera that her role must change to glorify the sacrifices of the nation's war dead, a war that Great Uncle pursued at all costs. Sherriff's wife quits instead, fearing the wrath of Great Uncle and the government he controls.<br /><br />  Sarah, Sherriff's wife dies of an untimely stroke. Perhaps this could have been prevented had not other nations imposed an embargo on Great Uncle's nation because of his invasion of a neighbor and suppression - with chemical weapons - of internal dissidents.<br /><br />  Sherriff has just completed a new novel when Sarah dies. His American publisher's advance and expected royalties would have supported he and his wife for a long time, perhaps even allowing them to escape the country.<br /><br />  In grief, Sherriff buries the manuscript with his wife. It is hers, he thinks. He cannot share the effort the world.<br /><br />  Great Uncle calls upon Sherriff to ghostwrite a novel for him . . . and that's where the story really begins and I will not describe it.<br /><br />  Fear permeates every page of this tragic story. The fear of not knowing what any day will bring. The fear of saying the wrong word to the wrong person and dying for the mistake. This is a story of what it is like to live everyday in a prison. Diplomats cluck-cluck and ythe people suffer.<br /><br />  Keneally has a knack like Orwell's for putting the reader into an asphyxiating environment. You cannot make it through this novel without having your chest tighten . . . and then thinking of how horrible it must be to live in such a country. I don't know what Keneally's intent was, but he definitely makes the argument that allowing tyrants to remain unmolested is a crime against humanity.<br /><br />Jerrybe it. <br /> <br />  Fear permeates every page of this tragic story.

While his novels have varied in quality from time to time, he's always been a satisfying read - until &quot;Liars &amp; Thieves.&quot; I don't know what the problem is. Were creditors beating on Coonts' door and he had to rush something out? Does he have a contract with a publisher he doesnt like and thought a turkey might get him out of it? Did he simply have a bad couple of days?<br />  The plot and characters have been reviewed here so I won't repeat what others have already said. My criticism is that the Tommy Carmellini character is tissue thin. All the other characters, including the redoubtable Jake Grafton, are transparent, contrived and entirely unbelievable.<br />  You can see where Coonts get his bad guys in this one: parts of Bill and Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, Bruce Lindsey and the late Vince Foster, familiar to any news junkie, are all there. This wouldn't be bad if there was some suspense involved - but there isn't.<br />  Finally the editing and proofreading in this book are abominable.<br />  Despite the unbelievable plot and characters, Coonts' style is intact and this is a quick read. It just isn't a satisfying read. I do hope that this is the exception and not a precursor of things to come. In any event, when the next Coonts novel appears, I will snap it up. I just hope it won't be as disappointing as &quot;Liars &amp; Thieves.&quot;<br />Jerry	2004-07-20

On the same evening, an intruder apparently seeks to murder the Senator.<br />  Thus begins the adventure. The plot takes one twist and turn after another. Unbeknownst to Langan, his son is a member of a team carrying out a sensitive mission in a region of the Phillipines occupied by Islamist militants. Gunther Krugman is missing.<br />  This is one of the best crafted suspense thrillers I've ever read. Stroud's characters are richly developed and his scenes are persuasive: you can practically smell the stink of the jungle and the bouquet of the fine wines in the D.C., Virginia and Pennsylvania countryside.<br />  Ultimately there is cross, double-cross and triple-cross and one hell of a fine read.<br />Jerry	2004-07-20

His \\"The Butcher's Boy\\" is a masterpiece of suspense. \\"Death Benefits\\" doesn't rise to that level, but it is still suspense, wonderfully woven.<br />  Ellen Synder, a fast rising star for the McLaren insurance company, leaves before dawn for a mysterious meeting. At McLaren's headquarters, John Walker, an analyst is taken under the wing by Max Stillman, a security investigator. Walker, who had a brief romance with Snyder, is needed because Snyder may have been somehow involved with a multi-million dollar fraud.<br />  Thus begins a cross-country journey with timeouts for a few dead bodies, a Florida hurricane, more insurance scams and more than one life threatening experience.<br />  Perry's characters have depth and are interesting. A burly computer hacker and his far more attractive associate get involved.<br />  The quest leads them ultimately to an odd New Hampshire town with centuries of thievery behind it - and a town where everyone packs a gun and wants to kill Walker, Stillman and Serena, the lissome computer hacker.<br />  The ending is a bit disappointing, but still well done.<br />  All said, it's Thomas Perry: a masterful suspense novelist at work.

He begins with a history of the region and Iraq and the peculiar political and religious currents that have formed the peoples of the area. Next he covers the transition of European thinking that has led to so many contemporary tragedies like Rwanda and the stagnation of the UN. Keegan pays particular attention to the French and Jacques Chirac. It is no surprise that Chirac fought so tenaciously to keep Saddam and the Ba'ath Party in power.<br />  Next Keegan details in brief the preparations for war and the campaign itself. His treatment is simply superb. He encapsulates all the notable military activity into barely 100 pages. Finally Keegan provides an overview of what went wrong with the post-war administration by Garner and Bremmer.<br />  Overall, &quot;The Iraq War&quot; is, in my opinion, a masterpiece. It puts all the essential facts necessary for a balanced understanding of the conflict into a single, slim volume.<br />  How I wish people would read this before opining, particularly critics of the war.<br />Jerry	2004-07-08

Keegan, a military historian of the first tier, examines the full scope of military intelligence and its ramifications.<br />  He convincingly demonstrates that accurate intelligence has almost always been unavailable - and even in the few instances it was available, its impact has not been the decisive element.<br />  Keegan examine Lord Nelson's 73 day quest for the French fleet, relying upon merchants, captured sailors, ambassadors and just about everyone else for information. In the end, it was Nelson's experience and intuition that brought his fleet to battle with the French.<br />  Perhaps his most telling example concerns the Battle of Midway. The Americans had exceptional intelligence and yet, as Keegan shows, the American victory resolved itself to four minutes of good fortune. So it goes in war.<br />  Yes, some governments spend millions and billions on gathering intelligence. No, it is very rare for that intelligence gathering process to produce sucessful results as a norm. War is a business where secrets are not given up easily and are difficult to ferret out.<br />  Keegan maintains that in the end, intelligence isn't a handmaiden to victory in battle, but perhaps a cousin once removed.<br />Jerry	2004-07-06

The language is modern and vibrant.<br />  More importantly, the depth of his perception, his understanding of the changes wrought upon his world have never been rendered so clearly. There is no feeling of antiquity to these words: you sense the author's awe and admiration for the American experiment.<br />  It would be a better nation if more thinking people read Tocqueville and I can think of no better translation than this one.<br />Jerry	2004-07-06

At that level, &quot;The Battle For History&quot; is invaluable. It is as if your studies of the subject are being guided by one of the most eminent historians of the period.<br />  First published in 1996, even the lapse of 8 years is telling.

All were enjoyable, but each is dragged down by Coben's penchant for complex plots that often veer into the unbelievable. He also has an unfortunate tendency to carry some characters from one novel to another. This is particularly grueling because Coben's characters aren't well developed to begin with.<br />  All that said and done, Coben is a thoroughly enjoyable read.<br />  His plots, as stretched as they become, have a glow of craftsmanship to them. They definitely do propel you through the story. The characters, flat as they often are, still have enough heft to keep your interest.<br />  In short, Coben and in this case &quot;Tell No One&quot; are just plain fun reads. They will keep your interest. I intend to pursue all of Coben's novels, not only because they are fun reading, but because this writer has a future and could indeed turn out to be one of the best suspense novelists of all time. It's kind of fun to watch his growth.<br />Jerry	2004-07-05

Coben's plots have more twists and turns then a roller coaster. There is a surprise literally every few pages.<br />  And that is the problem. Some of the surprises, many of them in fact, are simply jarring. They are clearly dramatic devices intended to move the story forward and the reader is sometimes forced to deliberately invoke their own sense of credulity.<br />  Fortunately Coben's enough of a storyteller to involve the reader to the point of doing just that.<br />  Coben is a powerful writer. His characters, while lacking depth and believability, are engrossing. The good folks are far and few between, the bad guys and dolls are plentiful and you simply can't be sure of where everyone stands.<br />  The ending of &quot;Gone for Good&quot; is disappointing. Coben has to wrap up too many loose ends and it smacks of a 1930s movie with the detective assembling everyone in the drawing room and lecturing each suspect until revealing the perpetrator. Of course, it doesn't help that the &quot;surprise&quot; at the end is simply too surprising.<br />  All that said, Coben is an immensely gifted writer who clearly has not reached his prime. He's entertaining, pulls you from page to page and is very clearly on the verge of breaking through. I'll be reading his five other novels to see if he's made it there yet.<br />Jerry	2004-07-04

It begins as a horror tale - and not a bad one - and ends as a religious bromide, which I found jarring and disappointing.<br />  The first few chapters are indeed the stuff of good horror stories. A luminous rain falls upon the world. Clocks run backward. Communications are disrupted. Coyotes congregate on the front porch, seemingly frightened into docility.<br />  Hero and heroine embark on a journey from their remote house to the nearby small rural hamlet. The town drunk utters a dire warning. A strange growth is found in the bathroom. The townspeople are divided in their opinions as to what should be done.<br />  Molly decides they should find the children whom she believes have been abandoned or worse.<br />  From this point on, the characters become shallow, the action repetitive and unbelievable and the plot simply impossible to accept. It all winds up as part of some divine battle between good and evil; God and Satan or whatever.<br />  Ultimately &quot;The Taking&quot; is disappointing because it is neither horror nor religious. I get the feeling that the author tried a variety of endings and chose the one that he thought would get him a movie deal or something. The conclusion of the story just doesn't fit. It left me with the feeling that there was originally another ending plan, the destruction of humans on Earth perhaps - and that the author changed his mind.<br />  On the whole, &quot;The Taking&quot; is something to read at the beach, in between long naps.<br />Jerry	2004-06-30

I found that tome narrow and tainted by a tinge of unnecessary political partisanship that seem grafted on to please his Washington Post constituiency.<br />  However pedestrian I found &quot;In The Company Of Soldiers,&quot; Atkinson's style was strong enough to tempt me to pick up &quot;An Army At Dawn.&quot; I am elated that I did.<br />  Given the broader challenge of an entire military theatre and the availability of huge historical resources, Atkinson has produced an absolutely superb military history.<br />  His skill as a compiler of history is first-class. He weaves together virtually every element. The origins of the conflict. The ultimately brilliant decisions of Franklin Roosevelt and George Marshall in managing the American war effort. The clumsy and inefficient manner in which the American Army was assembled and trained. The almost criminal initial missteps. And finally the welding together of a skilled, experienced, battle-hardened American combat force.<br />  Atkinson provides insight into the thinking and behavior of all the combatants: Germans, Italians, British Empire, French (as enemies and strained allies) and Americans. He covers all the ranks from generals to the lowest soldiers. Perspective is provided on the Byzantine politics of both Allies and Axis.<br />  In sum, Atkinson does what the great compiler of history should do: he provides a full picture of the times and the events. This is the first of a promised trilogy. I am looking forward to his next volumes.<br />Jerry	2004-06-30

She has help from an odd assortment of characters. An assistant federal district attorney. A reputed mobster. All are tied to her by a decades old incident.<br />  The characters are reasonably well developed, but still never become compelling. The plot takes one twist after another, some of them predictable, some not. The ending struck me as contrived.<br />  It's not a bad book; it's just far from a totally engrossing read. And, as noted, it on the unsatisfying side. Kind of like a barely passable lunch: it all looks good on the plate, but simply doesn't taste quite right.<br />Jerry	2004-06-28

He does an admirable job of mixing biography and political philosophy. Many contemporary &quot;Democrats,&quot; with little memory of their party's past will wonder what Miller is talking about.<br />  Miller harkens from a different era, when government intrusion was considered wrong, except in unusual circumstances. He comes from another age where people relied on themselves, their families and communities.<br />  This was long before the idea of special rights for special groups, &quot;entitlements&quot; to feed from the public budget, special interests growing fat on taxpayer dollars and every real or imagined societal problem needing a bureacracy of its own and still more taxpayer dollars to support its zealots.<br />  In other words, Miller remembers and pines for a Democratic party that maintained a semblance of commonsense and pragmatism.<br />  This isn't a political polemic. It isn't another of those angry screeds that seem to be pouring from right and left alike. It is instead a remorseful tome, a longing for a past that was unquestionably a better place to be. A society that saw in itself the solutions, for the most part, of its own problems.<br />  Miller isn't without guile here. He really doesn't address many of the more unsavory aspects of his own party, such as its resistance to civil rights through the 1960s. But he does accurately paint a portrait of a national political party that long ago shed any honesty and now panders only to a special interest groups and uses taxpayer money to support them, a party that seems to exist only to extend its own power with little regard for the future of the nation.<br />Jerry	2004-06-16

He has written several other books. This one recounts his experience as an embedded journalist with the 101st Airborne Division in Iraq.<br />  In particular, Atkinson follows Major General David Petraeus, commanding general of the 101st. His subject is perhaps his misfortune. Atkinson's view is both from the top down and the peripherary, since the 101st was employed primarily in a supporting role.<br />  The overall result is a portrait of a commanding general with a broader overview of the entire Iraq campaign grafted to it. The book is well-written, interesting but ultimately unsatisfying in some ways. There is little feeling of the struggle inherent to any military campaign and essentially no connection with the individual soldiers fighting the war. This definitely is not Ernie Pyle.<br />  Atkinson, unfortunately, mars this pedestrian account with the seemingly mandatory &quot;told you so&quot; about the aftermath of the campaign. His critique seems a bit strained and out of place in a book that is ostensibly about the campaign itself.<br />  That said, reading &quot;In The Company Of Soldiers&quot; left me eager to read &quot;An Army At Dawn,&quot; Atkinson's history of the campaign in North Africa. I think, frankly, that may be a better canvas for his skills.<br />Jerry	2004-06-15

Within minutes, Langdon is dragooned into a mysterious murder at the CERN complex in Switzerland. He gets there via a futuristic jet, the introduction of which is a bit disturbing. Brown normally stays with real things or believably real - and this particular device feels out of place. You can see the reason for its introduction: Langdon simply wouldn't have time to take a normal flight, not even a charter and keep the story moving. Aside from that truffle, though, the story moves at a blistering pace, with one plot twist after another. To Brown's credit, many of the twists turn out to be unexpected, though some are definitely predictable.<br />  On the whole, a delightful, fun read.<br />Jerry	2004-06-15

Few things excite me more than learning about the past, recent and distant.<br />  The Romans, of course, are central to our culture. Almost three millennia after its founding, Roman beliefs, institutions, practices, even their language are embedded in our everyday life.<br />  Unfortunately, the three academics who authored this history appear to have little grasp of how to make the study of history interesting - and no idea of how to write in something other than a stilted academic style.<br />  In short, &quot;The Romans&quot; manages to make a fascinating subject dull. The facts are most certainly there, but they are rendered as nothing more than facts, one piled upon another, devoid of the humanizing spark that makes history so much fun.<br />  The relatively few maps are surprisigly amateurish with little relief to indicate what is being illustrated. These maps too are the products of academics.<br />  Apparently intended as a college text, &quot;The Romans&quot; is simply a failure. It may gain its authors a bit more prestige in their academic circles, but it does a disservice to students who might otherwise gain an understanding of where our culture comes from and who might also be explore history more fully and become better informed citizens as a result.<br />Jerry	2004-06-13

His characters feel real, the plot twists and turns with not a few sub-plots to keep you guessing. And the ending leaves you wanting more Estleman. He's that good.<br />Jerry	2004-06-13

Of course they won't read it, because they are convinced that liberal political thought is the only rational way of thinking. Which, coincidentally, is exactly what Goldberg points out: the media is liberal because virtually every member of the media is liberal. So when Dan Rather or the local newspaper reporter talks to a colleague, they are talking to an echo chamber. They don't get the idea that outside their envelope, most people not only don't think like they do - but think their liberal bias goes against the grain of what America is all about.<br />  Goldberg explains, for those who didn't know it, that The New York Times essentially sets the agenda for the rest of the press. And The New York Times, for those who may somehow have missed it, is simply interested in only the leftmost of viewpoints. Anyone who doesn't share the values of its editors, reporters and columnists is obviously a racist, homophobic, redneck ignoramus.<br />  Thus the press is biased, but since all their colleagues and friends are biased to the left as well, they think any other viewpoint is subversive, if not flat-out wrong.<br />  Goldberg himself doesn't seem to have an axe to grind, beyond the way he feels he was dealt with by CBS, his former employer, and even on that subject, he is mild. He is definitely not a shrill attacker like Ann Coulter. He is, in my view at least, a man who sees the press for what it is: a group of narrow minded people who are far more bigoted and restricted in their worldview than most of the of the people they crusade against.<br />  It's unlikely that anyone in the media will admit their bias, but Goldberg does lay out an amusing 12 step recovery program for them. Well worth reading, regardless of your political orientation.<br />Jerry	2004-06-13

It is time to be ashamed.&quot;<br />  Shipler's agenda is clear: take the money from taxpayers and give it to other people. Wealth redistribution to some, Marxism or socialism to others, Shipler's idea is to strip some of their earnings in order to &quot;lift&quot; those who have failed to take advantage of the opportunities offered in this country - or have other problems, such as drug addiction and alcoholism.<br />  Shipler makes his biases clear through blanket statements such as liberals support intact families while conservatives demand dysfunctional families. He offers no support for such claims - and it is unlikely that such blatant generalizations could be supported.<br />  Ultimately Shipler gives away his own flawed perspspective. He claims &quot;[a]s the the people in these pages show, working poverty is a constellation of difficulties that magnify one another: not just low wages but also low education; not just dead-end jobs, but also limited abilities, not just insufficient savings but also unwise spending, not just poor housing but also poor parenting, not jsut the lack of health insurance but also the lack of healthy households.&quot; Two paragraphs later he asserts &quot;[a]ll of the problems have to be attacked at once.&quot;<br />  Like those revolutionaries (a tiny band) who gave birth to the long discredited concept of the &quot;New Soviet Man,&quot; Shipler's solution would require the vast majority of responsible, hard-working people to surrender their own limited money and freedom to serve the needs of the few who have squandered their opportunities, consciously made poor decisions that they blame others for and refuse to take responsibility for.<br />  Unrepentant Marxists, unthinking do-gooders and those who want everyone to share equally in misery will love this book.

U. S. Air Force Major General Patrick McLanahan goes over the line again and is demoted and sent to another unit where he is told to keep his nose to the grindstone and his mouth shut.<br />  Of course, McLanahan just happens to notice something that no one else sees or believes: a sneak nuclear attack by Russia against the United States. They'd just be getting even for McLanahan's sneak attack against Russia, but that's another earlier book.<br />  Brown rolls out his usual staggering array of technologically advanced weapons, his skills at convincing his colleagues to take unauthorized actions that could land them in prison and introduces one plot twist after another.<br />  Yes, the whole thing is unbelievable - but that's only after you've blazed through the entire book. And even then, you won't regret the time you spent reading &quot;Plan of Attack,&quot; because it's what a techno-thriller should be.

This is an odd, but thoroughly enjoyable, novel. Set in Galway, Ireland, Jack Taylor is an alcoholic and cocaine addict, recently bounced from the Guards. He arrives back in Galway, looks up old friends, consumes quantities of booze and coke and is approached by a man who wants him to help solve the murders of several &quot;tinkers,&quot; formerly known in less politically correct days as Gypsies.<br />  Taylor's approach to things is, putting it mildly, chaotic. He is given to a love of old rock 'n roll music, has an expectedly odd assortment of friends, makes enemies easily and suffers fierce hangovers.<br />  But he does solve the mystery in the end in an unpredictable way.<br />  Overall, Bruen's writing is wonderfully quirky. Jack Taylor is a well developed character; so well-developed, in fact, that he's not particularly likeable. Most of the other characters are kind of thing, but passable.<br />  The plot . . . well, it isn't a smooth and winding road, that's for sure. But the twists are fun to roll with. A satisfying excursion with an author with a unique approach. If half-stars were a possibility, I'd give it four and a half. Not quite a five, but well worth reading.<br />Jerry	2004-06-03

If you need a thriller to keep you entranced for a long weekend, &quot;The Face of the Assassin&quot; should be high on your list.<br />  Paul Bern is a forensic artist: he recreates likenesses of the deceased, working from their skulls. A woman brings him a skull and as Bern works on building a face around it, he is troubled. A household accident brings him to see what is so troubling: the face he has reconstructed from the skull is - you guessed it - his own.<br />  By twists and turns, Bern learns that he had a twin brother who met his end in an untimely and unseemly way. A mysterious agent offers Bern the opportunity to track down his brother's killers - or, should he refuse, face an unseemly end of his own life.<br />  Oh yes, a terrorist or two has to be tracked down along the way.<br />  This thriller moves quickly. Bern is believable as are the other major characters. Bern learns the ins-and-outs of spycraft perhaps a bit too easily, but after all, his twin brother was a spy, so perhaps it's genetic. In any event, the minor disconnects aren't enough to keep this from being a thoroughly enjoyable read with a reasonably solid surprise ending.<br />Jerry	2004-06-03

What really caused the great stock market bubble of the 90s? Who was responsible for the economic growth of that decade? Who are the villains that robbed millions of their life savings?<br />  Lowenstein weaves a stomach turning tale of rampant dishonesty and criminality; individual, corporate and political greed; the willful failure of law enforcement on the federal level; the blindness created by greed and exposes the myth of the so-called Clinton boom years.<br />  In the end, Lowenstein shows how the Depression-era laws intended to protect the public against stock swindles were simply ignored by the Clinton Administration. Sharp-witted corporate executives learned that they could loot the companies they ran in behalf of the shareholders and the shareholders themselves. The investment bankers learned that they could tout stocks with impunity, no longer having to fear being penalized for lying about the companies they cheered and simply turning a blind eye to accounting arcana and bad news. The accounting and legal professions, supposedly self-policing, dedicated themselves to finding ways to make dung look like gold, even if they couldn't remove the smell. The media, with its legions of financial &quot;reporters&quot; and their dependence on the advertising revenue of the very businesses they reported on, did no fact checking of their own, but simply parrotted the lies they were fed.<br />  And the government? Then President Clinton and legislators simply took the donations of the very people who were fomenting the bubble - and turned a blind eye to enforcing the laws.<br />  Several thousand people grew very, very rich from all this chicanery - while millions lost money, sometimes disastrously so.<br />  Lowenstein describes how it all began with the inflation of stock options awarded to executives. It didn't take long for corporate executives with compliant boards, lawyers and accountants to realize that a seemingly unlimited flow of wealth was waiting to be tapped. The investment bankers and stock analysts saw - as it always has been - how stock prices could be run up without a whit of truth supporting their claims. Buy, buy, buy became the mantra to the public - while the folks on the inside saw profit on every transaction.<br />  Enron and Worldcom were but the largest perpetrators of this sham on the company side, assisted by legions of lawyers who sought loopholes, accountants who looked the other way, stockbrokers who didn't care as long as the public kept buying - and regulators and politicians who lined their own pockets.<br />  It's a sad tale of the Clinton boom. It never was what it was publicized as being - it was a sham and millions of ordinary people are the poorer for it. But not the fat cats in the White House, Congress, the brokers or the others who pulled it off. A few may ultimately go to some country club jail, but they'll be able to afford whatever they want from the commissary.<br />Jerrypped.

Ipse dixit is an unsupported assertion, usually by a person of standing. Woodward has specialized in this brand of 'journalism&quot; since his &quot;All The President's Men.&quot; The unidentified source whom we are to accept because Woodward (and at that time, Carl Bernstein) say so. Oviously that approach can lend itself to all manner of mischief, if not duplicity. In &quot;Plan Of Attack,&quot; Woodward relies on attributed interviews with some of the primary players, including President Bush, but he also relies upon 75 unattributed sources whose veracity is unprovable, except for Woodward's claims of truthfulness. Ipse dixit: we are supposed to trust Bob Woodward alone. Sorry, but in my view, that's gossip; not history, not journalism.<br />  The mainstream media attempted to play up this book as yet another in the parade of anti-Bush, anti-Iraq War books. Woodward, to his credit, denied that such was his intent, despite the words The New York Times and others attempted to attribute to him. (Ipsedixitism gone wrong.)<br />  Woodward has actually produced a worthwhile, informative oral history of the path to the decision to invade Iraq. His biases are clear: this man is no Bush partisan and he is willing to bend the truth when it comes to protecting the reputations of his beloved Democrats. Early in the book, Woodward whitewashes the Bay Of Pigs disaster by calling it a CIA failure. In fact, it was a failure on the part of President John F. Kennedy who essentially betrayed the Cuban resistance with his last minute cancellation of air and other support. Not many pages later, however, Woodward spares little detail in describing President George H. W. Bush's failure to provide support to Iraqis rebelling against Saddam in 1991. Woodward does indeed have his axes to grind, though he does not make a big show of it.<br />  Woodward's &quot;Plan Of Attack&quot; will not make Bush-bashers happy. He portrays the lead up to the decision to attack Iraq as an ultimately well reasoned process in which few stones were left unturned in a quest to resolve the issues without resort to armed force.<br />  One may disagree with the motivations of the Bush administration; one may in hindsight criticize the inteligence failures that produced claims of WDM for many years prior, but in Woodward's description of events, one would be hard-pressed to find fault with Bush, Rice, Rumsfeld, Cheney, Powell or any of the other key players in the Executive Branch. These were serious, intelligent people faced with a serious problem that had to be resolved: the neutralization or removal of Saddam Hussein or for that matter, any hostile government that might rule Iraq with its oil wealth and potential for creating trouble.<br />  The invasion of Iraq may, in coming years, truly be viewed in perspective as a mistake. But opponents of the President and his policies will find no comfort or support for their views in Woodward's &quot;Plan of Attack.&quot; What one will find is a revealing portrait of intelligent people, recognizing a threat to their nation (among many other threats) and approaching it with honesty in circumstances where not all the facts are or could be known.<br />  It's a worthwhile early history and, for any serious student of world affairs, a must-read.<br />JerryAttack&quot; will not make Bush-bashers happy.

This is revisionist history. Biased, slanted and laden with omissions. The Soviet Union - which murdered millions of its citizens - is presented as a bland protagonist that ultimately found its way through Yuri Andropov and Mikhail Gorbachev and, if Marxist Leninism had only been given a fair chance, would have become the Worker's Paradise its progandists had proclaimed in 1917.<br />  Walker's disdain for the United States could not be clearer. The United States is the ultimate source of all evil in the world. The Soviet repression of its own citizens and those in its satellites and foreign clients are essentially ignored or glossed over.<br />  Presidents Reagan and George H. W.

(I don't like to give plot details because I think it can interfere with the enjoyment of the novel.<br />  In competent hands the premise so far could have led to a satisfying thriller. Meltzer, apparently, lacks the competence to accomplish this.

His plots and characters are quirky, often taking unexpected - and sometimes irrelevant - turns.<br />  &quot;Burglar On The Prowl&quot; is an excellent example of Block's skills as a storyteller.<br />  Bernie Rhodenbarr is a bookseller, operating a small used bookstore. At least on occasion, when he decides to open the store. But wait, Bernie has another occupation: he's also a burglar. Bernie is thus an unusually literate and articulate criminal.<br />  A friend asks a favor of Bernie. Just a little thing: burgle the house of the friend's nemesis. No problem for Bernie. In fact, he'll bring a friend. Bernie you see is a very sociable burglar and has a wide circle of friends, all of whom he seems to have told of his penchant for burglary.<br />  There's a hard moment before Bernie can oblige his friend: another friend, a cop, hauls Bernie in connection with a multiple homicide. The cop, almost a refugee from a Damon Runyan story, has concluded that Bernie must have been in cahoots with the murderers because the burgled safe would have demanded Bernie's skills to crack.<br />  Bernie, of course, has something like a get out of jail free card and is sprung in short order by his lawyer who recently took up martial arts. This latter detail and many like it become important later.<br />  Everything becomes important latter because Bernie is a marvelous character who lives in a world of marvelous happenings, all of which eventually wind up as cogs in a big machine - the story Block is telling.<br />  Block may not be to everyone's tastes.

A seemingly fact-based narrative of the history and possible future(s) of our relationship with Saudi Arabia. Baer claims to have been a case officer in the Directorate of Operations for the Central Intelligence Agency from 1976 to 1997.<br />  His description of the fragility of the Kingdom and the development of our relationship is, in a word, frightening.<br />  Baer traces the history of the relationship with a non-partisan eye, which is refreshing. He details how Saudi Arabia has literally bought its way into the United States government and that nation's business, political and civic leadership over seven decades. Not only are the usual suspects on the Kingdom's payrolls, but many other names that may strike the reader as surprising. If what Baer says is true, it is surprising in a way to see what - and who - money will buy.<br />  More disturbing is Baer's description of the Royal House of Saud, its extravagence and corruption - which Baer asserts leaves the Royal Family and the United States sitting on a powder keg with a short fuse.<br />  Like ostriches, the Saudi Royals have attempted buying or killing off internal dissidents. Baer paints a bleak picture of how just a few targeted terrorist attacks could seriously damage the economies of the United States and nearly all other industrialized nations. His account of how a takeover by Islamic elements of the Saudi nation and its oil reserves could have calamitous results.<br />  Baer, whatever his actual background, has done a credible job here of describing a very difficult situation.

A bomb explodes in the Vienna office of a hunter of German war criminals.Thus is &quot;art restorer and sometime spy Gabriel Allon&quot; drawn into a search for a repulsive former German officer, sadist, torturer and killer.<br />  If the story weren't based on an actual human disaster of massive magnitude, it would be more enjoyable. Instead, to be reminded of the millions cold-bloodedly murdered by the German nation and its allies is depressing.<br />  But Silva writes a suspense filled novel of Allon's search. The characters are richly human. They are not supermen; they are humans seeking justice in an unjust world. Even for crimes that happened a half-century, their passion to seek justice for the dead drives them to put their own lives at risk.<br />  Silva's plot never stops or falters. The action keeps pushing ahead, though the reader might find a need to take a break from the recounting of the gruesome deeds being avenged.<br />  The knowledge that the background events Silva weaves into his story are, as noted, not the kind of things most people want to think about. But Silva tells a story of long-delayed justice that we can all hope - or wish - takes place in venues outside of fiction.<br />Jerry	2004-04-25

Do not begin your reading of this novel the night before you have an important morning meeting: you'll never get there. Dan Brown has crafted a classic page-turner. The Prologue has geologist Charles Brophy trudging across a glacier. Within moments, a plot involving the White House, NASA, the NRO, a power hungry Senator, various scientists, Delta Force commandos and a couple of very interesting young women begins to unfold like a series of hammer blows.<br />  Brown has the knack of painlessly leading the reader to suspend credulity. His writing is that smooth, his facts (yes, the novel is based on scientific fact) flowing together seamlessly.<br />  Heroes and villains are believable, even in the most extreme scenarios. The plot twists and weaves and the bad guys aren't who you first think they might be.<br />  One of the more unique elements of the novel is that two of Brown's main actors are young women. Though both are strikingly attractive, refreshingly Brown treats them as people, not sex objects. It's a nice touch.<br />  I am deliberately avoiding a description of the novel's actions and plot lines: it's just too much fun to discover them as they occur.<br />  The action is non-stop. Page-turner, pulse-pounder, all the cliches apply. Brown, who subsequently authored \\"The DaVinci Code,\\" is a master of the craft. Deception Point is wonderfully worthwhile.<br />Jerry	2004-04-17

This is simply the best biography of FDR I've ever read. It is delightfully devoid of partisanship and provides a portrait of Roosevelt as literally the 20th Century's &quot;Champion Of Freedom.&quot;<br />  Black has done a thorough job of research, uncovering a dazzling area of references that go far in describing Roosevelt as a man and as a politician.<br />  Not all is unstinting praise: the man's foibles and failures are described in detail, but not in shrill partisan tones. It's really marvelous in this era of revisionist and untruthful people claiming to be &quot;historians,&quot; to find a writer who approaches his subject honestly.<br />  It's slow, but exceptionally rewarding reading. I've never been a great fan of the New Deal and what it did to the concept of federal government, but Black's biography has left me with a far more favorable appreciation of Roosevelt.<br />Jerry	2004-04-01

He is simply outrageous with overblown plots, superhero characters and enough miracles of timing and coincidence that force credulity to its limits.<br />  That said, Cussler writes some of the most entertaining, exciting novels to be found. They read quickly and definitely have the ability to keep you awake long into the night.<br />  This time, unassuming, always modest, strategically well connected and fortunately wealthy Dirk Pitt has been reunited with his two unknown children after 20 years.<br />  All work for NUMA, a mysterious US government agency that concerns itself with a wide host of marine issues.<br />  A monster hurricane introduces us to Specter, a mysterious global tycoon who has anchored a hotel off an island lying directly in the path of this killer storm. Dirk and friends rescue the hotel while the meanie Specter escapes.<br />  Without a day off, Dirk and his ever present companion Al Giordino go off to explore mysterious construction in Central America - and needless to say discover a nefarious plot to dominate the world. I'll save the details for your reading --- it's way more fun to read the book and see it all unfold.<br />  Dirk's children (trouble prone as you might expect in the children of unassuming superheros) in the meantime discover remnants of the fabled Trojan era civilization in the Carribbean Sea. That is a story onto itslef and a fascinating one at that.<br />  Cussler requires you to set aside your sense of credulity. And you know what? It's worth it. He is a magnificient writer and carries you away with his story, no matter how unbelievable it becomes.<br />Jerry	2004-03-24

But the effort falls far short because of glaring inaccuracies and an apparent political bias that simply has no place in a purported history of flight.<br />  Crouch tells of an airship &quot;seven football fields&quot; long. No airshp, literally a Zeppelin, was 2,100 feet long. In another place, Crouch says a B-24 bomber comprised more than 1,500,000 parts held together by 4,000 rivets. Huh? Mr. Crouch is definitely more than a few rivets short in this case.<br />  Many may remember the controversy that surrounded the National Air and Space Museum exhbit a few years back that was withdrawn because of its implied criticism of the U.S. decision to use nuclear weapons against Japan. I do not know what role, if any, Mr. Crouch played in that exhibit, but his political bias against the U.S. action is in full bloom in this book, a very unfortunate display. This is purportedly a history of flight, not a platform for the author's political views.<br />  The factual errors noted above are jarring. If Crouch didn't read his manuscript carefully enough to eliminate a reference to a 2,100 foot airship, what other errors crept in?<br />  Overall, Wings is a treasure of anecdotal history. It is rich in detail, with many citations. But because of the errors noted here and numerous others, I would not want to rely on this book as the last word on the subject.<br />Jerry	2004-03-07

He summons his three sons to come at a specific time - and they find dying daddy and the collection gone.<br />  A talented writer could have made something of that. Douglas Preston does not. Instead each of the three sons is a cardboard cutout, patched together of literary Lego blocks: pipes, tweed jackets, cowboy boots and so on.<br />  The adventure tries to be adventurous, but for me reading this attempted thriller reminded me of waiting for a weather-delayed flight. You have to do something, even if its mildly unpleasant and very boring.<br />  Clive Cussler has the remarkable ability to take bizarre circumstancs, characters and plot twists and render them enjoyably exciting. Douglas Preston lacks that talent. You can pass \\"The Codex\\" by and miss nothing.<br />Jerry	2004-03-06

A secretive gangster family, corrupt politicians and a young widow just trying to get on with her life - until it is rudely terminated in gruesome rape and murder. A young man buys the local newspaper and propels himself into the soul of this yahoo paradise.<br />  The prosecution of the accused is told through the newspaper editor's eyes. Along the way he is befriended by an African-American woman of remarkable character, who becomes the first black woman to serve on a jury.<br />  The story is slow-paced, but thoroughly enjoyable. Several stories run concurrently, all of them seamlessly welded together into an enjoyable whole.<br />  It's not a page-turner, but like a fine wine or good scotch, a book to be taken in leisurely sips. The characters are well developed and interesting people. The plot moves nicely and the ending leaves you questioning whether it's contrived or not. There's doubt because you know for yourself that crazier things have happened.<br />  All in all, a fine read.<br />Jerry	2004-03-06

The flyleaf says that &quot;understanding the perspectives of others on these six great questions would help [Socrates] become a more excellent [sic] human being.&quot;<br />  Not mentioned is the need to have a diverse group in the discussion so that all viewpoints are heard and may be evaluated.<br />  Phillips does not do this. The groups he gathers are largely those who can be fairly described as leftists or liberals in their political thinking. As a result, the entire book is a prolonged rant against the ubiquitous &quot;them,&quot; the rich, the powerful, anyone who doesn't believe that what they have earned or owned is theirs alone.<br />  All of the copious references are to others whose views are similarly skewed.<br />  The Socratic method requires active debate to illuminate all viewpoints.

But with &quot;Mr. Paradise,&quot; he is definitely hot. Frank Delsa, acting lieutenant of Squad Seven, Homicide Section, Detroit Police Department has a couple of new murders to handle. An old rich guy with a penchant for young female playmates - and one of those very playmates who had the misfortune to be right there when Mr. Paradise was on the receiving end of a bullet. She gets one too for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br />  Whodunnit? Well, Delsa first has to figure out who got it. The young hired girlfriend? Or her lookalike friend who came to the house that night and just happened to be upstairs at the time of Mr. Paradise's accelerated exit from this world.<br />  It's a good police story. Characters drift in and out, each adding a little bit of necessary information to the story. None of them will ever win a Nobel Prize, but they kind of remind me of Daman Runyon's people; the dumb folks who think they are smart and wind up wearing orange jumpsuits or buying the Brooklyn Bridge.<br />  The story moves nicely; the few loose ends don't rattle too much and there's a pleasant ending, at least for Frank Delsa.<br />  It's a fun read, a good story.<br />Jerry	2004-03-06

In one, he relies on no less an authority on human population trends than Pat Buchanan. Yes, Pat Buchanan, sometime pundit, sometime Presidential candidate. Goliszek references Buchanan's book. _The Death of the West_ as the source of &quot;alarming statistics. Goliszek goes on to claim that Buchanan's statistics are backed by UN studies and a London Times analysis. But Goliszek never specifically cites any statistics or sources.<br />  This is the equivalent of getting stock tips from your brother-in-law whose barber knows the guy who shines the shoes of a big-shot CEO who said something big would be happening with his company.<br />  Indeed, Goliszek piles on scary anecdote atop another. But even with all his claimed sources and citations, nothing quite hangs together. Overall I was left with the impression of yet another academic engaging in dubious &quot;research&quot; primarily to impress his peers and maybe turn a few heads on the talkshow circuit. The flyleaf says &quot;No other book on the market provides the research here - or presents it with such persuasive force.&quot; Well, it appears the &quot;research&quot; is tacked on to lend bulk to the book: it is often not connected to anything in the book and it is persuasive only to the uncritical, the same people who believe what the tabloid press writes.<br />Jerry	2004-02-20

His characters not only live, but grow. They are not supermen or superwoman, but ordinary people thrown into the maelstrom of war. They possess virtues despised by many now: a love of their country, a sense of duty and a willingness to surrender their lives for something they believe in.<br />  And Griffin, like Shakespeare, does not shrink from seeing good people meet bad ends. He tells of life as it is in war: people, good people, are grievously injured and sometimes die.<br />  But a Griffin novel is an uplifting experience. He does not glorify war nor does he mask or enhance its brutality. He simply tells a story, deeply moving stories.<br />  In &quot;Retreat, Hell!&quot; many of the charcters from his previous novels are with us, older now, more experienced. It is a story of the Korean Conflict from June through Novermber, 1950. Mistakes at high level abound --- such as the failure of MacArthur's intelligence to detect the threats of North Korean invasion and Chinese intervention. But the ingenuity of the American soldier, so often a civilian just weeks before, is well described. Not unlike the sargeant who in a French field improvised a blade to plow through the hedgerows, Griffin's main characters adapt to the circumstances. A few high-level officers subtly avoid the bureaucracy and let the real soldiers fight their war.<br />  By the end of the day, the main points of history are still intact: General MacArthur made grievous mistakes as did the CIA and the politicians. The soldiers, however, anonymous and unsung do their job and fight beyond the call of duty. No glorious heros these; just ordinary men doing extraordinary things, as one Marine said.<br />  Griffin's genius is being able to tell such a story naturally, simply and utterly compellingly.<br />Jerry	2004-01-22

Laden with detail, it covers all of Lincoln's life and provides great insight into the forces that shaped the man. But the detail itself is perhaps too much.<br />  Donald's research is impressive. One detail piled upon another. You get a great sense of how Lincoln spent his time, of how the nation thought. But what is missing is animation. Donald wisely keeps whatever biases and opinions he has to himself, for which he is to be greatly commended. No revisionist history here, no trumpeting of personal viewpoints as fact: a delightful relief from many contemporary &quot;historians.&quot;<br />  The result, however, is somewhat lifeless. I don't know if this is good or bad. It is left to the reader to supply the &quot;color&quot; of Lincoln and his times, the vibrancy of the world at that time.<br />  I don't know if Donald could have added this missing flavor without destroying his fine narrative. I think probably not and am glad he didn't try. On the other hand, the missing element makes this otherwise exemplary biography a somewhat slow read.<br />  That said, I recommend &quot;Lincoln&quot; to anyone who wants to know more of the man and his times without an author's bias distorting the truth.<br />Jerry	2003-12-25

The United States of the late 21st Century faces a crisis that can be resolved only if former President Bill Clinton, then 109 years old, does things a bit differently ---- 60 years earlier.<br />  Clinton's hand-picked biographer is dragooned into a time travel adventure that is marvelously inventive and informative to boot. Yes, the novel has a political cast, but as one blurb writer said, even if you hated Bill Clinton, it's still an enjoyable story.<br />  And it truly is.

Tucker recounts his journey through a lengthy career as a trial lawyer and along the way demonstrates that our judicial system, while short of perfect, is still the best in the world. Tucker helped the poor, the wealthy, the politically powerful and powerless and the reviled through the judicial system. Some cases he won; some he lost.<br />  Win or lose, however, Tucker fought the good fight for his clients, often pro bono.<br />  His story is complete. He reveals the importance of trial preparation -- an element that truly separates competent lawyers from their clumsy brethern (the latter of which I always seem to retain; while the former retain me as an expert witness). Tucker tells some wonderful stories about judges, good and bad. Like Tucker, I am from the Chicago area and am very familiar with bad judges. Tucker discloses that there have been many good judges in the area as well and provides useful insight into their judicial reasoning.<br />  All in all, a wonderful book that will redeem lost faith in our judicial system. &quot;Trial and Error&quot; is not a courtroom thriller: it is far better than one -- it's real life and I for one am glad that Tucker decided to take the time to write his memoir. It is well worth reading.<br />Jerry	2003-09-03

But this present effort isn't quite up to snuff. While Hall is a master of plot, this one has a few too many utterly implausible twists and some turns that simply don't overcome this reader's sense of credibility.<br />  Thorn, Hall's wonderfully crafted character, adds a few new problems and opportunities to his life in the form of Alexandra, a new romantic interest, and her doddering father who is introduced for reasons I don't quite fathom.<br />  The main villain, Vic Joy, is simply unbelievable.<br />  It's not a bad read: Hall keeps things moving along a quick pace and some of the scenes are tension producing. But overall, &quot;Off The Chart&quot; simply isn't up to the standard Hall himself has set with his earlier work. Still, for anyone who enjoys Hall's work or for those simply looking for a reasonably good adventure, I would recommend this novel - but with less vigor than I have for his prior work.<br />Jerry	2003-06-19

Ms Blood offers undoubtedly heartfelt advice, but there is nothing here that could not be found on the Web. It's just a compendium of advice, much of which should be apparent to any intelligent, mannerly person. To wit: &quot;You will never need to be ashamed of anything you have written if you are always respectful of others and their opinions, and if your thoughts are well reasoned and carefully expressed&quot; and gems such as &quot;Do not misrepresent other people's positions.&quot;<br />  Overall, the book has nothing to do with the mechanics of blogging, such as setting up your blog.<br />  For people who are perhaps shy or frightened of expressing their opinions in public, Ms. Blood's book might prove of value as a crutch, a rules of the road for engaging in public discourse through a blog or other journal.<br />  But for anyone who already possesses rudimentary social skills and has an interest in expressing their opinion to a hopefully wide audience, &quot;The Weblog Handbook&quot; will be of little use. A much better choice would be either &quot;Blog On&quot; or &quot;Blogging: Genius Strategies for Instant Web Content.&quot; Both offer, in less detailed form, the same philosophy proffered by Ms. Blood, but also contain more down-to-earth advice on creating, managing, administering and publicizing your blog.<br />Jerry	2003-06-05

Unfortunately most of it can be found in the Microsoft Access 2000 Help file.

Hampton Sides' &quot;Ghost Soldiers&quot; is a story of Japanese brutality and racism, the sorry, dishonest nature of the Democratic administration of the early 1940's that gleefully sacrificed American lives to cover their own narrow-minded mistakes -- and of values liberals have longed since weaned out of American culture and heroism: patriotism, military discipline, a willingness to die for country, freedom and fellow man.<br />  This narrative of four horrible years for the Filipinos, Americans, British and others taken prisioner by the Imperial Japanese Army is over-hyped as the &quot;epic story of World War II's most dramatic mission.&quot; It wasn't by a long shot.<br />Rather, as Sides' story unrolls, it was a fairly routine mission: rescue prisoners in an enemy POW camp. Some of the missions were staged solely to satisfy a general's vanity. A mission in Europe to rescue the son-in-law of General Patton that turned into a small-scale disaster. (Full-scale disaster to those who died.) The rescue mission in Sides' book was undertaken in part to rehabilitate the tarnished reputation of Gen. MacArthur.<br />Sides' attention to historically correct detail is admirable. His descriptions of the geography, the units, the commanders and some of the enlisted, aircraft and weapons types - all are right on the mark.<br />He builds the drama by describing the misery of the American soldiers who, after being lied to by President Roosevelt through MacArthur are encouraged to figt on in the belief that relief was on the way. In truth, no relief was on the way and the American troops were merely sacrificial lambs. It is difficult to suppress anger while reading of the horrors the American government inflicted upon its own - and then read of the greater cruelties visited upon them by the Japanese. (Any of the revisionist liberal historians claiming that Americans were racists re the Japanese hasn't bother studying both sides of the story.)<br />While every Filapina and American participant in this adventure is a hero, military or civilian, the particular focus is on a unit of American Rangers. Elite troops that couldn't exist today because feminist and other special interest groups have made it impossible to create effective combat forces. The Rangers were men's men - the term not being used in the contemporary sense. These were ordinary men, raised during the Great Depression in the days before the NEA decided its teacher union members and Ritalin should be in complete charge of raising children, relegating parents to the role of outsiders. Many grew up on farms and weren't taught to fear guns. All still had that old-fashioned idea of being responsible.<br />In short, nearly all would be turned down for jobs today because of their silly notions, most of which are considered evidence of bias and bigotry today.<br />The Rangers set out to rescue the prisoners from a POW camp. Some of the prisoners are survivors of Bataan and Corriegidor. Most of the book is about people, their experiences, sometimes their hopes. The power of war to control the destiny of lives is clearly defined. The valor of the Rangers setting out against great odds is superbly described. There's very little combat, a minimum of blood and gore - and one of the saddest stories you'll ever read about the needless deaths of fine and decent young men.<br />At bottom, this is an &quot;America and its people are great&quot; story.<br />You won't find on the shelves of many, if any, public schools or other byways of academia.

I'll spare you the plot since other reviewers have already described it well.<br />  Bill Lane is another almost believable super-hero. You suspend your credulity while he does his derring-do . . . endlessly. As with most thrillers, the plot is inherently unbelievable.

With Richard Sherbaniuk, who thanks Cussler in his acknowledgements, was obviously an apt student - and out of the box rivals Cussler.  &quot;The Fifth Horseman&quot; acheives something few authors are capable of doing: giving life to an unbelievable hero who exists in a plot that demands a reader to suspend objective thought.  In short, Sherbaniuk on his first try has created a magnificient thriller. Dr. Michael Zammit is a genius, an intrepid explorer, a master of survival, a committed environmentalist (without the looniness associated with so many who claim that title) and all-around superman.  Sherbaniuk's brilliance is breathing life into Zasmmit and several other larger than life good and bad guys and gals. And he does it almost flawlessly.  The action unrolls at a furious pace. Zammit bounces from one major adventure to another. He survives lack of sleep, kidnapping, unarmed combat among other things. A real man would probably have been twice dead in the first third of the novel. But through Sherbaniuk's skilled pen, Zammit saves the world from a brilliant, evil mastermind.  &quot;The Fifth Horseman is a great read. My eyes were glued to it for three evenings. Had I not had to earn a living, it would have been finished in a day - it's that good. Make sure to put it on your reading list - and then urge Sherbaniuk to write another and another and another . . .<br />Jerry	2001-06-18

Having read his previous 12 titles, the characters seemed like old friends and even a few enemies. One of Brown's great gifts is transparently overcoming your credulity, so you accept without notice the occasional flight into another universe.  Brown uses one device repeatedly to give his &quot;white hat&quot; characters a human side while relentlessly destroying the enemies of humanity: continual thoughts of and flashbacks to spouses, children, family, all those things that make us melt. The bad guys, of course, never think this way: they just plain enjoy murder and mayhem.  Makes no difference to me because Brown's depictions of military action in the air are superb. Hard to believe in this era when wars are fought for real on your TV screen, that any author can get your pulse and to beat faster, but this is precisely what Brown does.  He's a great writer of military adventures. Put &quot;Warrior Class&quot; on your reading list - and consider his other 12 books as well.<br />Jerry	2001-06-04

Not Harold Coyle. His mastery of the craft continues to grow.  &quot;Dead Hand&quot; turned out to be a two-night read. If I didn't have a deadline project to deal with, it would have been read in a single night.  The plot spans the globe. His use of an extraordinary device sounds and feels plausible. He manages to imbue eight (8!) major characters with lives of their own, in addition to a slew of minor characters, passing through and adding credence to the story. The combat, necessarily, is not on a grand scale. Rather the main conflict is between small, highly-trained and very deadly commando and special forces teams. The conclusion is what it should be: small steps lead to intense combat and believable heroic acts by friend and foe alike. The one-page epilogue compels you think about the sacrifices made by so many unheralded warriors to preserve or acheive freedom.  Reading this novel provides the same thrill as first readings of Clancy and Ludlum, before they became &quot;production line&quot; writers.  If you enjoy combat thrillers laced with global politics, &quot;Dead Hand&quot; will provide you with a fine, exciting  experience.<br />Jerry	2001-05-18

If only the authors, their editors and production staff had put in a few more hours work. The concept is great. But the execution is very flawed.  Errors abound. Some descriptions and illustrations just don't belong together. On occasion, the far too small to read without a magnifier code in the screen shots is just plain wrong.  I'm not sure if the authors or the editors deserve the blame on this one, but the structure is very strange. The authors will provide a &quot;do this&quot; example - and follow it with a couple of pages of explanations about various features. Unfortunately it isn't intuitive that the reader isn't expected to type the explanatory feature code shown on his machine. Very confusing and something that could have been prevented by legends or sidebars distinguishing between &quot;type this&quot; and &quot;don't type this.&quot;  The authors clearly know their stuff and, for the most part, do well in explaining VB6 to rank beginners. But all the errors make it somewhat irritating to use.  A few more hours of work and perhaps more skilled editors and production team people would convert this in a 5 star tutorial for beginning programmers.<br />Jerry	2001-04-08
US	52859210	R2LSMFESODQIXA	0060194855	678873627	Truth at Any Cost: Ken Starr and the Unmaking of Bill Clinton	Books	5	57	84	N	N	Objective and frightening	This book obviously inflames Clinton partisans because it doesn't deal with &quot;spin,&quot; but only that which can be factually supported with court transcripts, produced documents and the like. There's no &quot;Deep  Throat&quot; or other unidentified sources here.  And the facts all lead  to the same place: William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United  States lied under oath. A federal judge fined him $90,000 for that and  Clinton didn't appeal the ruling. Sens. Lieberman, Feinstein and others all  publicly announced their belief that the President had committed illegal  acts that were punishable under criminal law, even if they didn't rise to  the level of impeachable acts.  Because the book relies so heavily on  facts, it is somewhat slow reading and those who actually followed the  events (not the &quot;spin&quot;) will find little new here. Isikoff's book  is actually more fun to read, though less encyclopedic in its fact  gathering.  For those who don't want the truth or can't admit to it,  there's always Toobin.  Starr doesn't come across as a hero really, but  rather as a man who truly believes that no person is above the law and that  the law is to be applied equally to low and high. If you've never been a  party to a civil or criminal action or have any knowledge of the function  of law in a democracy, you won't understand the importance of those two  concepts - nor will you ever understand how important the service, however  flawed from a &quot;spin&quot; perspective, Starr performed for the nation.  If Starr could have only combined his legal skills with the charisma of a  Clinton, the Clinton Presidency would have been over in a flash.  Instead,  as this book clearly demonstrates in its flat, dull language, we have  established partisanship and spin as being more important than law.  We  will most assuredly suffer for that in the future.<br />Jerry	2000-05-13

Coyle writes about infantry combat from the grunt's perspective. You feel  the fear of the enlisted men, seeking firm guidance from their officers -  and the different kinds of uncertainty emanating from these two very  different kinds of officers. I started reading this book Thursday afternoon  and, putting my work aside, couldn't put it down until I had finished it  Friday evening. That's the power of Harold Coyle's writing.	2000-02-12

Clearly intended as a teaching aid, its approach is substantially different than most of the other well done VB books.  The authors take a very methodical, step-by-step approach to VB and presume  that you are a newcomer. But what they've actually done is to create one of  the finest references for BASIC, Visual Basic and programming languages in  general.  Each element of VB is described in detail with excellent  examples. From the IDE to building ActiveX controls. Unlike some VB books,  this one doesn't intend to turn the neophyte into an &quot;expert,&quot;  but rather provides the core knowledge that every programmer should  possess.  I enjoyed it so much that I'm adding it to my VB collection,  despite having a number of other volumes already. This one is just plan  handy as a quick reference when I forget - as I suspect we all do from time  to time - the basics of BASIC.<br />Jerry	2000-02-10

A salt of the earth guy with solid morals and streetsmarts. He really doesn't want to get involved with anyone else's life - and doesn't want anyone involved with  his.  But once people lacking his decency force their way into his life .  . . well, they get hurt. And you feel good because they do. Real good.  Granted, there are few bumps in the plot, but they easily tossed aside  because you want to move on to the next page and the one after that to  learn what happens.  Reacher is in one of those fallow periods every man  would love to have . . . no fixed abode, no obligations, no  responsibilities and no thought of tomorrow. He's digging swimming pools in  Key West. Someone from up north is looking for him . . . and the regulated  mayhem begins.  Reacher is not all action. He thinks. He feels. And best  of all, he's human. You can finish &quot;Tripwire&quot; and feel  exhilarated because you've just spent some time in the company of a genuine  hero.  And in this day and age of Clinton morality, that's a real change.  A welcome one.<br />Jerry	2000-02-03

Peter Maas has a gift. His words make men and women whom we'll never know personally come alive.  In his telling of the tale of the Squalus, Maas also provides a shocking glimpse into the rigidity of the pre-World War II  Navy, presents a picture of domestic life that we no longer enjoy (and  probably are worse off for it) and the willingness of men to willingly  endure danger. It is also the story of one very brave, very determined man  who fought a stolid bureaucracy in order to save the lives of his comrades.  Maas' reporting - and that's what it really is - is solid. He never gets  into phony histrionics, but his descriptions of the reality are frightening  - you can imagine the terror of being trapped in a submarine, 240 feet  below the surface, not knowing if you will be dead or alive in a matter of  hours. Maas also captures the unassuming and unfailing courage of the  rescuers who fight inadequate equipment, foul weather and fate itself.  The Terrible Hours is adventure of the most terrifying kind because it  recounts a reality most of us could never endure.<br />Jerry	1999-12-09

I don't recall reading anything by Clive Egleton before &quot;Dead Reckoning.&quot; Of course I also admit that the vast number of books I read never quite distinguish themselves in my mind and get dumped into a  kind of cerebral soup.  &quot;Dead Reckoning&quot; is perfect for several  nights pre-sleep reading or, if you're in a warm climate (lucky you), take  it to the beach.  The opening sets the stage beautifully for the rest of  the story. Peter Ashton is revealed to us as a brave, cunning, loving but  somewhat limited man, hemmed in by the politics of his bureaucracy.  Ashton's first goal is not protecting his nation as a &quot;secret  agent,&quot; but shielding his very competent wife from harm.  The story  never stops moving. Egleton reveals one detail after another, introduces  one plot twist at a time. The book never becomes heart-stopping, but it  never becomes dull either.  Egleton's involvement of technology is  different than that employed by others (i.e., Dale Brown): Egleton has  actually taken the time to research the limited technology he describes -  and gets it right. (I am always jarred when I read someone like Brown or  Clancy and they describe something that is flat out wrong.)  Overall,  &quot;Dead Reckoning&quot; is a good read. It will not keep you awake into  the early hours, turning pages - but in the end it will leave you with a  very satisfying feeling.<br />Jerry	1999-12-09

Ever watch a movie or read a book so bad that you finish it just to see if it gets worse?  I just finished doing that in reading &quot;The Einsten Papers.&quot;  The characters are cardboard cut-outs. A singular  &quot;super agent&quot; who protects the world. He's a government employee  - who apparently lives well beyond his means, much like Aldrich Ames, with  collections of motorcycles, boats and other possessions which normally  wouldn't be accumulated by an ordinary civil servant on the government  payroll. (Tom Clancy and others at least provide an explanation for their  character's wealth. There is none here.)  Dirgo seems to have a thing for  food. I've never seen so many diversions to record what the characters ate  for breakfast, lunch and dinner, none of which propel the plot forward.  The plot is simple and, unfortunately, predictable. Even when attempting to  place his characters in grave, even mortal, danger, Dirgo simply lacks the  capability of causing the reader to worry. You know from the first  paragraph who the good and bad guys are and what will be their ultimate  ends.  In short, there is no suspense, there is no thrill to be found in  &quot;The Einstein Papers.&quot; This is certainly not a  &quot;techno-thriller.&quot; The little bits of science and technology that  appear are thrown in almost willy-nilly. This isn't like reading Dale  Brown, say, where an aircraft becomes almost a living and breathing entity.  This is more like hearing a know-it-all tossing off factoids about the  airliner you're both on. No depth.  I read it from beginning to end, but  only because I was interested in seeing just how bad it could get.  The  ending is a whimper. Overall, I was left with the impression that Mr. Dirgo  will never again appear on my reading list.<br />Jerry	1999-07-19
