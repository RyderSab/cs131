Hunters of fascists - ha ha! <br /> <br />Their own assassination scenarios invariably contradict one another, and they never stop to consider that since only one of those scenarios (at most) could possibly be right, then the others must obviously be wrong and that this impugns them as a group.  And if 99.9% of JFK conspiracy theory is bilge, as it must be, why should one assume that there is anything to the remainder? <br /> <br />JFK conspiracy theorists only agree among themselves on a handful of things:  1) historical study is to be used as a tool of leftist political activism, not as a means of discovering the truth; 2) the Marxist assassin Oswald must necessarily be regarded not as an assassin but as a martyr; and 3) JFK was a leftist saint who was murdered by the forces of reaction that he opposed. <br /> <br />Conspiracy theorists want you to look at the evidence through their own specially-convexed glasses in order to exonerate Oswald and implicate The Right.  And after you've done that, they want you to join them in avenging JFK by liquidating The Right and making America once again into a groovy Woodstock nation where long hair (facial and cranial), psychedelic drugs, and casual sex with far-out hippie chicks can once again run wild - all without cost or consequence. <br /> <br />Yes, I know that Woodstock took place six years after Dallas, but still, that's what grassy knoll lefties have in mind.  If you doubt this, go find a photograph on the Internet of the long-haired Martin Shackelford, his face permanently frozen in a tantrum of Sixties dissent.  If they can kill a president, how come the forces of reaction can't step forward again and shut these hippies up? <br /> <br />OK, but I picked up \\"Triangle of Death\\" and read it - not because I expected to be convinced of anything but because I recognized from the jacket cover that this would be a different type of JFK conspiracy book. <br /> <br />And to their credit, the authors, Brad O'Leary and L.E. Seymour, don't seek to portray JFK as a leftist saint or as any sort of saint.  They disdain the Stone/Prouty view of history, including the notion that Kennedy had any intentions of withdrawing American troops from Vietnam or that speculation to this effect had any part in his death, admirably placing the documentary evidence of a proposal to reduce American troop involvement in its proper context. <br /> <br />Also, they disdain the notion, popular in leftist circles, that JFK's botched Bay of Pigs invasion played any role in his death. <br /> <br />This is all to the good, and O'Leary and Seymour also remain largely inoculated from the disease of terminal leftism, though they do insist that Ho Chinh Minh was a political reformer mistreated by the colonial powers, instead of a genuine Commie - echoing leftist Castro apologia. <br /> <br />The authors acknowledge the recklessness of JFK's actions in Vietnam - particularly with regard to his role in the coup of the Diem brothers.  Indeed, they suggest that JFK had a hand in their assassination, not just their overthrow.  If E. Howard Hunt had access to this material, he wouldn't have needed to forge anything. <br /> <br />An informative account of the \\"triangle of death\\" involving the French heroin syndicate, the American Mafia, and the South Vietnamese government is included.  JFK was killed, they say, because his secret campaign against the Diem brothers (actualized three weeks before his own death) threatened the heroin-based profits enjoyed by this network. <br /> <br />By the way, the idea is not an original one.  A version of it first surfaced in 1975 or so in a work of FICTION; i.e., Charles McCarry's \\"Tears of Autumn\\" from his \\"Paul Christopher\\" series of novels.  History imitates art! <br /> <br />What the authors haven't done, of course, is prove their theory of a connection between this triangle and JFK`s death.  It largely rests on speculation plus a declassified CIA document, dated April 1, 1964, that noted that a French assassin was in Dallas on the afternoon of November 22, 1963 and was whisked away afterwards. <br /> <br />But how is this factoid to be distinguished as genuine history, as opposed to any one of a number of rumors that swirled and continue to swirl around JFK's death?  The source of this information, according to the memo, was a \\"Mr. Papich\\".  The authors of this book acknowledge that they don't know who he is and dismiss the issue as unimportant. <br /> <br />This betokens a lack of thoroughness on their part, since a quick Google search discloses the identity of one Sam Papich, who was the FBI's liasion with the CIA, and whose name is connected in other such memos with CIA plots against Castro and post-assassination investigations by American intelligence.  Papich passed away only recently and was alive while this book was being written.  He would have been available (if not necessarily cooperative) for an interview with the authors, if they had only discovered him, but there's nothing in any other memo in which Papich is mentioned to suggest that he maintained any continuing interest in a possible \\"French connection\\". <br /> <br />The sheer accumulation of happenstance involved in the homicide itself renders the possibility of conspiracy extremely unlikely.  But the authors don't get around to discussing ballistics until the end of the book, and I'd already put the book down because its dry treatment of an interesting but already-overcovered topic exhausted me. <br /> <br />Until the end, they blandly accept the conspiracists' version of ballistics as the defining one and they refer all discussion to Robert Groden - a waxy-mustachioed leftist who couldn't catch a cold, let alone a Presidential assassin. <br /> <br />Notwithstanding these criticisms, I'm awarding as much as 3 stars to O'Leary and Seymour as a reward for a certain amount of originality and independence.	2005-09-25

Lon Chaney is supposed to have once said that there is nothing funny about a clown at midnight, and anyone who has watched an extremely lengthy extra-inning night baseball game last relentlessly into the following morning knows that the character of the game takes on a different hue than that shown on a lazy summer afternoon or heady early evening. <br /> <br />This book is somewhat misnamed, as not all of the short baseball stories contained herein have an underlying \\"murder\\" theme.  But all of them - written a few years ago at about the onset of the millennium - do touch upon the dark side of the human psyche. <br /> <br />As with any collection, some stories are better than others.  \\"Ropa Vieja\\" was written by a woman, and the protagonist is a female detective who notes a number of individuals of questionable immigration status playing baseball on a Baltimore playground and naturally enough concludes that this means that Baltimore is changing for the better.  I don't remember anything about the story, beyond that. <br /> <br />And John Lesocroart's \\"Sacrifice Hit\\" could have been an effective dark tale about the excessively serious \\"life or death\\" attitudes held by some parents and coaches towards their kids performance in Little League ball.  But in the end, it merely delivered the insipid message that excessive zealotry is BAD when demonstrated in the cause of victory on the field but GOOD when demonstrated in the causes of \\"sportsmanship and inclusion\\".  Well, la-de-da! <br /> <br />Most of these stories are pretty good though.  Many take place in the past, which is generally a positive thing.  Troy Soos's regularly-recurring part-time ballplayer, full-time detective from the turn of the 20th century, Mickey Rawlings, makes a favorable appearance here in \\"Pick Off Play\\". <br /> <br />However, in order to engage yourself in this story, you've got to swallow the idea of a pitcher from that era who charges opposing hitters \\"protection\\" to have him refrain from nailing them with a bean ball.  In a pre-designated-hitter era, in which the pitcher himself had to take his turn at the plate, swift retaliation would have been suffered by any pitcher who tried to fund his retirement account in that way. <br /> <br />Mike Lupica's \\"The Shot\\" might seem just a LITTLE dated in a post-Idiot baseball era in which the World Champion Boston Red Sox have finally shed their perennial hard luck image, but it still had me eagerly turning pages.  Yet I must confess that I thought it had somewhat of a stupid \\"shaggy dog\\" ending that did not justify the build-up.  I wonder what YOUR opinion will be on that score.  I am debating within myself as to whether I want to buy any of Lupica's baseball novels. <br /> <br />Lawrence Block's detective attempts to solve the 1961 \\"murder\\" of the famous Bill Veeck baseball midget, Eddie Gaedel.  Brendan Dubois and Henry Slesar master the art of the perfectly executed surprise ending as flawlessly as a Branch Rickey-conceived hit-and-run.  Slesar, in particular, left what (in retrospect) seems to be a fairly obvious clue that I didn't pick up on.  I wonder whether that's a reflection of the writer's craft or of my own mental slowness, and again, I wonder how other readers responded. <br /> <br />Some will recognize Slesar as a prolific short-story mystery writer from the 1960's, whose works often appear in old Alfred Hitchcock collections.  It's nice to see that in 2001, he was still rounding out to mid-season form. <br /> <br />In the year 2005, this is a very readable collection as a whole, assuming that the San Francisco Giants aren't already providing enough horrors for you on the field.	2005-04-26
US	50691488	R2OLZGTSM2OIW	1592281303	644896143	The Quotable Baseball Fanatic	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Brevity should be the soul of baseball wit.	Athletics, in general, and baseball, in particular, are strange animals.  It's not often that the learned have any real fascination with or adoration for the unlearned, but athletics are the exception to the rule. <br /> <br />Virtually every athlete's autobiography is ghost-written.  And those who observe athletics and communicate about what they observe are often blessed or cursed with a formal education - think of Roger Angell, Bartlett Giamatti, and Doris Kearns Goodwin. <br /> <br />Yet the athletes themselves are generally not Rhodes scholars, even though they are more likely to have a formal education now than in previous years - and even though they have ALWAYS been likely to have an instinctive brand of intelligence that isn't necessarily honed by formal education. <br /> <br />Roy Blount makes this point in what is otherwise a somewhat addled introduction to this collection of baseball quotations, edited by Louis Rubin.  The collection itself has a quotation in it making the point that the average baseball player knows far more about his profession than does the smartest sportswriter. <br /> <br />Yogi Berra's oft-quoted observation that it was impossible to think and hit at the same time is a perfect example of that instinctive brand of intelligence.  When Joe Louis said of Billy Conn, \\"He can run, but he can't hide\\", he was imparting more wisdom than you could ever hope to receive in a dozen treatises from Leonard Koppett. <br /> <br />And there's a wonderful story in this collection in which an earnest sportswriter asks Leo Durocher if he's going to try to get his team off to a fast start when the season begins.  \\"No, you stupid ---!\\" Durocher replies.  \\"I'm gonna lose the first ten games!\\" <br /> <br />So no book of baseball quotations can be all bad, and there are other good ones in here, but in spite of all the warning signs, Rubin often does err on the side of the intellectualoids, giving us a little too much of their frothy eloquence and not quiteenough of the ballplayers' peasant wisdom. <br /> <br />A collection that includes six George Will quotations is a collection overburdened by at least six quotations, though it IS gratifying to be reminded of the misery that the Chicago Cubs have put Will through.   <br /> <br />Fred Leib provides a little too much background to Casey Stengel's superimposing himself over the Yankee front office's cover story that he had retired with the flat declaration, \\"Boys, I've just been fired\\".  It might have been better to just include the quotation itself, which stands on its own (with perhaps a brief explanation in italics below an attribution to Leib`s book). <br /> <br />Stengel himself was capable of rambling as well, and this collection includes some lengthy Stengelese diatribe.  But I would have also elected to include Casey's forthright and brief answer to why he ordered slow-footed weak-hitting pitcher Bob Turley to (successfully) attempt to execute the hit-and-run instead of bunting:  \\"Because it's run, sheep, run, and you can't bunt the lively ball\\". <br /> <br />A pink cloud threatens baseball today.  Baseball is a game of uniquely masculine imagery and ritual and as in every other field known for its masculine mystery today, it is being encroached upon by the female menace. <br /> <br />In addition to the infestation of the game with female sportswriters, the Giants have been cursed for years with a female public address announcer, and the Yankees have recently hired a female color commentator.  Female encroachment upon any pastime inevitably deprives it of all mystique, and it's more of a threat to baseball than all of the gambling scandals, big money, drug scandals, and steroids controversies put together. <br /> <br />For this reason, I am grateful to Rubin for including quotations from a couple of old-time baseball men, Rogers Hornsby and John McGraw (discussing the subject of players wives), about a woman's proper role in the game.	2005-03-12

Bill Watterson probably only THOUGHT that he was kidding. <br /> <br />\\"Wacky Laws\\" is yet another book about some of the strange incidents that find their way into the legal system and some of the strange decisions that make their way OUT of the system.  However, this book also has a separate section on \\"Government Waste\\" detailing some of the more outre projects on which our money is being spent - which is where the above story comes from. <br /> <br />As you might expect, this book also has the usual collection of blue laws that defy belief - and some that don't.  I don't think that it's too much of a mental strain to figure out why some ancient Wisconsin legislators made it illegal to serve apple pie in their state without a cheese topping. <br /> <br />But why would the city fathers of Macomb, Illinois make it illegal for an automobile to impersonate a wolf?  It must be the only city in the world whose in-custody defendants would have to wait for trial parked in a garage. <br /> <br />The last section contains a number of true-life cases, in which the reader is asked to apply the law to the facts and compare his decision with that of the trial courts and appellate courts who heard the same case. <br /> <br />As a member of the bar, I missed a fair number of these, and I can't help but wonder if I didn't over-analyze them.  Quite possibly, the average non-attorney reader who doesn't find himself wondering what the authors were leaving out will do better than the average attorney. <br /> <br />Then again, I'm not sure that the authors always described the facts correctly or were always aware of which facts were important (there is nothing in this volume to indicate that any of the four authors are attorneys themselves) or that the decisions handed down at the time would necessarily be arrived at today. <br /> <br />We are told, for instance, that a homicide victim's statement to a nurse that her husband had poisoned her was thrown out of court as \\"classic hearsay\\".  Well, I'd assumed that she'd made that statement while conscious of her impending death - which would certainly have made it admissible as a \\"dying declaration\\" in most jurisdictions. <br /> <br />And I have a hard time believing that an insurance company negligently issuing a policy that gave the beneficiary a motive for murder could really be held civilly liable for the murder of the insured by the beneficiary.  That really sounds like a highly speculative Palsgraf-like chain of causation, determinable only with hindsight.  Wouldn't ANY policy of life insurance provide its beneficiary with the same motive? <br /> <br />Still, this book is recommended as pleasant light instructive reading on a subject that fascinates so many of those who DON'T practice it for a living and especially recommended for readers who think that they could do a better job than those who do.	2005-03-06
US	50691488	R2LH1JHPRNFYSG	1573920053	846212927	Reincarnation	Books	3	10	15	N	Y	An experience you'll want to relive over and over again!	I have a disdain for the notion of reincarnation, and to my mind, others who are similarly skeptical, such as Paul Edwards, the author of this book, never propound the best arguments against it. <br /> <br />If we were ordained to live many times over, the friendships and loving relationships that we experience in any given lifetime would be rendered worthless by an eschatological process that usually erases our memories clean of them and sends us back into the world to acquire new ones. <br /> <br />Moreover, if our parents, siblings and descendants in one lifetime might be related to us in a different manner in another lifetime, the whole process of rebirth becomes somewhat incestuous, notwithstanding the transposition of bodies and the absence of memories.  If there is a Supreme Being, he's surely restored more divine order to universal chaos than would actually exist if we really were to live again. <br /> <br />So I actually picked up Edwards's book as a member of the anti-reincarnation choir waiting to be preached to, but this book was only somewhat satisfying in that regard.  He spends a lot of time inveighing against the methodology used by New Age gurus and parapsychologists, exposing the frauds and charlatans among them.  This includes a re-examination of the famous \\"Bridey Murphy\\" case. <br /> <br />Otherwise, it seems to be a book meant primarily for philosophy students and teachers. Many of its arguments allude to terms and concepts that leave this political science major scratching my head.   <br /> <br />Others will sound more familiar such as the \\"absence of justice\\" argument (those of us who don't remember our past incarnations won't remember why we are being rewarded or punished in our present ones) and the \\"population\\" argument (the amount of people who have ever lived is many times greater than those alive now - so in what sort of halfway house are unreincarnated souls waiting to be reborn in?  And if we have all lived before, why is it that newsouls are no longer being created?). <br /> <br />If it is intended as a scholarly work, it's a somewhat slipshod one.  There are a number of occasions where the author is developing a line of thought and then breaks it off, promising to pick it up again in a later chapter. <br /> <br />Edwards's argument is largely an atheistic one against any sort of post-death survival whatsoever, relying largely upon what he sees as the inseparability of the mind and the body.  However, he does concede the theoretical possibility of an apocalyptic resurrection and reconstruction of original body parts and a reconstitution of each original mind within.  The mind/body issue is apparently an age-old philosophical dispute, and Edwards comes down squarely on the side that the mind cannot exist separate and apart from the body that it directs. <br /> <br />But however persuasive his argument against ANY sort of survival might be from an empirical point of view, it seems to largely ignore stories of Near-Death-Experiences (NDE's) in which an unconscious patient was later able to give accurate descriptions of what was going on around him. <br /> <br />Maybe these stories would also lose their credibility upon being subjected to the same rigorous academic scrutiny that Edwards and others subject Ian Wilson's cases of spontaneous memories of past lives, but that has never been done to my satisfaction, in this book or in any other skeptical work. <br /> <br />Edwards has a sardonic wit that I can especially appreciate, and he often interrupts his empirical analysis to skewer a number of targets, including religious fundamentalism.  His disparagement of the divine in general may yet prove to be correct, but it is an undercurrent that runs through this work and sometimes detracts from it.  At one point, he borrows from Christian philosopher, C.S. Lewis, to inveigh against theocracy as \\"the worst of all governments\\". <br /> <br />Both Edwards and Lewis seem oblivious to the truism that atheism can be as much of a religion as theism, and the destruction wrought during the 20th century by atheistic governments in Germany and Soviet Russia suggest that it can be just as deadly.   <br /> <br />Regardless of the state of evidence concerning survival in general and reincarnation in particular or of the existence of a divine being, a little less trenchant agnosticism and awe towards the Unknown might suit Edwards better as a human being and as an academic.	2005-01-10

If you thought that intentionally-staged train wrecks only took place in old Addams Family re-runs, check out this little slice of Fresnocana - a pictorial history of the annual Big Fresno Fair. <br /> <br />In 1919, some promoter actually did stage as the fair's feature attraction - not a crash between two cars on a model railroad - but the REAL THING:  a collision between two locomotives purchased from the Santa Fe Railroad. <br /> <br />The two locomotives were named the Fair Special and the Raisin Express.  Well, this is Fresno, after all.  No doubt, in Hawaii, it would have been called the \\"Pineapple Express\\". <br /> <br />What exactly took place on that fateful day still seems to be a matter of dispute, and this collection includes a 50-year retrospective by then-Fresno schoolboy, Pulitzer Prize winner William Saroyan - an excerpt from his 1969 Fresno Bee article on the Great Train Wreck. <br /> <br />Claude \\"Pop\\" Laval was the early 20th century Ansel Adams of the San Joaquin Valley (though his photographic collection is by no means confined to rustic settings), and his pictures can be found in a large number of libraries, courthouses, offices, and other public settings in the area. <br /> <br />This portion of his collection, edited by his great-granddaughter, Elizabeth Laval, exclusively covers period shots of the yearly county fair that takes place in the city of Fresno on the fairgrounds located at Ventura and Chance.   <br /> <br />Predominant are ag exhibits and other domestic displays, livestock exhibits, air shows, auto racing, horse racing - memories of which are lovingly preserved in Laval's old black-and-whites.  One photo of the fairground's parking lot from 1941 shows it studded from top to bottom with old Model T's. <br /> <br />Also included is some interesting history on the fair's closure during the Second World War (\\"War Fair\\") and the facility's temporary use for military purposes, including a brief stint as a relocation center for Japaneseinternees. <br /> <br />Baby shows were once annual events from another era, and their importance was underscored at a time when the fair was continuing to operate during the First World War. <br /> <br />There is a 1916 Fresno Bee editorial written by an Agricultural Department employee explaining the utility of the Fair during wartime, in which he humanely observes (with an eye to the long view), \\"Though soldiers are in tremendous demand, the most important people in the world today are babies.  The flower of our youth may come back mangled, nerve-wracked and devitalized, unfit to be the sire of coming generations.  How important then, that every baby be born well and raised well.\\" <br /> <br />Proceeds from the sale of the book benefit a restoration project aimed at preserving negatives of other images of the Great Valley captured by Pop Laval.  In the end, I find myself wondering whatever happened to the old Raisin Day Parades - and what sort of exhilarating act of destruction might be performed (considering the sensitive times we live in now) at the 2019 County Fair to commemorate the centennial of the great train wreck!	2004-12-31

But one can be a Druittologist without risking one's standing in polite Ripper society. <br /> <br />There's no evidence that Francis Tumblety was the murderer either - he doesn't resemble any description of the Ripper and he might have been in custody when Mary Jane Kelley was murdered.  The case against Tumblety is also based entirely on the long-after-the-fact musings of a retired police officer.  But one can be a Tumbletonian without incurring the wrath of Mr. Harris. <br /> <br />There's no evidence that Joseph Kelly...but why stretch this out?  Just mention Liverpool cotton broker James Maybrick (who bore an uncanny resemblance to one police drawing of the Ripper) and the Maybrick Diary and Watch (which have not failed any test designed to expose modern forgeries) and Ripperologists roll their eyes, foam at the mouth, and have nothing coherent to say - unless it's to demand a 19th century videotape of Maybrick killing prostitutes before even agreeing to consider him as a suspect. <br /> <br />Even without the videotape, the case against Maybrick is exceptionally strong, and a handful of Maybrickians have, for the past twelve years, struggled against the background noise to perfect the case against him  - something not demanded for any other suspect.   <br /> <br />Shirley Harrison, who first brought the world the Maybrick/Ripper Diary back in 1992, takes pen in hand again to discuss the trials and tribulations that she has undergone since then - and to review the case against Maybrick, as well as the leads that she has followed up on since 1992. <br /> <br />Much of this book seems to be written off of the same template as Harrision's first or borrows from Paul Feldman's book, though there are a few tantalizing clues that have developed since then which don't quite add up to a proverbial \\"smoking gun\\". <br /> <br />If the diary and watch themselves are not \\"smoking guns\\", then nothing else has been found which amounts to one - and yet...and yet...Ms. Harrison finds nuggets (American rumors of a Ripper diary circulating in St. Louis in 1888, British rumors of a diary written by Mrs. Maybrick in 1889, first revealed by Feldman, memoranda of deceased correspondents who knew or suspected a Maybrick/Ripper connection before the publication of Ms. Harrison's book, etc.) which make the \\"smoking gun\\" seem...ever...so...close.  Actually, along this line, while Ms. Harrison borrows liberally from Paul Feldman at times, she ignores interviews that he conducted with living Maybrick descendants that really do suggest that their elders carried a terrible family secret to their graves. <br /> <br />And she does allow herself to get sidetracked.  In reviewing the evidence against Maybrick - scientific and psychological - she would have done better to leave Sir Jim's astrological reading out of it.  That's only going to provide more fodder for her critics to chew on. <br /> <br />It's actually quite amazing that Ms. Harrison, out of an abundance of caution, downplays some of the more intriguing evidence, such as the \\"Diego Laurenz\\" letter to the Liverpool Echo, while displaying no caution at all in wasting time and paper on astrological indicators. <br /> <br />Most disappointing of all is that the book does not come close to living up to its promise to incriminate Maybrick as having committed a number of serial murders in Austin, Texas in 1884-5.  The jacket cover has the temerity to promise to place Maybrick \\"at the scene\\" of these eight murders, which occurred in the space of about a year. <br /> <br />This promise isn't fulfilled, and Maybrick's involvement in the eight Austin murders is left open as just one more tantalizing possibility.  The trouble is that the Maybrick Diary itself, (and again, it was Ms. Harrison who introduced us to it) does not even remotely hint that its author committed ANY earlier murders ANYWHERE. <br /> <br />To the contrary, the Diary's author seems to treat serial murder as a brand new game.  There is a reference in the Diary to one or two murders in Manchester, England in 1888 that are not regarded as part of the Ripper canon, and the earlier Manchester murder is described as Maybrick's \\"first\\".  If the diary is genuine, its language downplays the notion of any Maybrick/Ripper murders occurring before March 1888. <br /> <br />I think that Ms. Harrison is trying a little too hard to gild the Maybrick lily here.  I also think that the best part of the book might be the postscript written by Liverpool psychology professor David Canter. <br /> <br />Professor Canter doesn't unreservedly endorse the diary as a genuine historical document, but he does provide a wonderfully clever critique of just how accurate it is, how true it rings, and how perfect a forgery it would have to be.  At one point, he wonders mischievously what in the world the genius who is supposed to have \\"forged\\" it has to gain by remaining silent at this late date. <br /> <br />Professor Canter might well turn out to be the Maybrickian's answer to Melvin Harris - only wittier and more genial.  His writing provides a reminder that when the Diary is removed from the clutches of hysterical Ripperologists screaming \\"Fake!\\" and shown to students of the human condition, such as psychologists and lawyers, the skepticism largely vanishes and it is regarded as one more intriguing blueprint of that condition. <br /> <br />Surely, as the years go by, more of these students will continue to review this fascinating document, and surely this is one more reason to believe that posterity is on the side of the Maybrickians.

Everyone \\"learned\\" what Republicans and Clinton opponents were like during the impeachment struggle when Democrats and Clinton partisans used their control of the mainstream media to portray their opponents:  rich, white male right-wing extremists, cynically using traditional morality and Judeo-Christian ethos as a means of trying to unseat a popularly-elected advocate for the less-fortunate - and blinded by their \\"hatred\\" of him.    So no one on the Clinton Left is likely to read this autobiography by the House impeachment manager because it would smash such lovingly-treasured stereotypes.    This is the story of a young man who grew up James Baroni in a working-class family in San Francisco's Mission District, suffered through a great deal of family tragedy, and ended up living with his estranged mother in the even more-deprived area of Pinole.      For the most part, he plays the juvenile delinquent in order to get \\"in\\" with the rough element in his neighborhood - and it's only a box-top interest in politics that fills him with any ambition to get an education as a means of uplifting himself.  At this point, Rogan's politics, as one might expect, to the extent they are formulated, are pro-union Democrat, but a political celebrity is a political celebrity, and he's not too partisan to rub elbows with Republicans such as Gerald Ford.    After finally getting his primary and secondary education, he tries to put himself through law school by circulating as a bartender in some of the grungier bars of Southern California.    It's all for the purpose of ultimately establishing himself in politics, during which, in 1978, amazingly enough, Rogan meets a certain governor of Arkansas who urges him to follow his dream.    And while Rogan's story is largely an inspirational tale with a number of other interesting passages, it disappoints in certain ways.  The promotion of this book doesn't indicate that it's going to be a rags-to-riches story, and if you're not prepared for an extraordinary amount of poverty and grunge, you might not fully enjoy it.    You definitely aren't going to enjoy it if you are looking for a lowdown on what life was like on the impeachment battlefront.  The book teases you with that by starting out with Rogan about to address the Senate in his role as impeachment manager, and then in true Hollywood fashion flashing back to San Francisco and Pinole.    That's it.  Rogan never really flashes forward to impeachment again, thereby cheating the readers who wanted to learn more about it.  At the end of this narrative, Rogan is taking Newt Gingrich's advice to write what amounts to a picaresque autobiography while saving impeachment for a later book.    The trouble is that academia is as liberal and leftist as is media, and the Clintonistas are already working in the historical sphere to \\"spin\\" the history of their master's administration.  Douglas Brinkley, who sought a Schlesinger-like role as court historian for a Kerry Administration, has already written a book about the American presidency, in which he allows Clinton to completely define his own term in office.    No one connected with impeachment has written his own book about it, as far as I know, and a contribution from someone like Rogan would be a valuable counterweight.  He should have started on such a contribution sooner rather than later.    Then too, it would be interesting to learn how Rogan, who appearsto have broken every rule (including \\"honesty is the best policy\\") as a means of surviving the mean streets of Pinole and the bars of the San Fernando Valley came to represent the forces of forthrightness in 1998 - since \\"hatred\\" of Bill Clinton was obviously not a factor (in addition to the 1978 meeting, the book contains a Rogan family portrait with the President from 1997).    Is Rogan even being completely forthright in this book?  I have a hard time believing the story of a friend who came back from the Navy with the biggest Afro that Rogan ever saw (presumably somehow avoiding a naval regulation haircut) or a political science teacher in 1968 ignorant enough to insist that Harry Truman died twenty years ago (\\"I saw his funeral on TV\\" - but in 1948, the rest of the country saw Truman upsetting Dewey).    Finally, where's the bitterness?  Perhaps Rogan was not so much a victim of impeachment backlash in 2000 as he was a victim of the district's changing demographics.  Considering the district's large Democrat advantage in registration, Rogan might well have been turned out anyway, and I don't remember Adam Schiff raising impeachment as an issue.    But to the extent that Rogan WAS a victim of impeachment backlash, where's the bitterness?  For doing his duty under the Constitution, Rogan might have been a victim of tag-rag voters manipulated by Antonian rhetoric into tearing apart those would liberate them from Bill Clinton's Caesarian hegemony.    Rogan's defeat exemplifies the flaws inherent in a democracy where the depredations of the many are allowed to outweigh the courage and superiority of the exceptional. Rather than sugarcoat, as he does, the upshot of an election that terminated a career that Rogan had worked a lifetime to achieve, he should have ended his book by shaking his fist at the voters of the 29th and waxing lyrical in Irish fashion:  \\"Oh, me name it is Sam Hall, and I've robbed both great and small.  And I hate you one and all - damn your eyes!\\"	2004-11-15
US	50691488	R1DLHG5HF63W9N	1400053781	925238834	Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media	Books	4	21	26	N	N	Stop the presses - somebody please!	Liberal news media bias has been discussed since the early days of the Nixon administration.  One book from that era - possibly written by Raymond Price - emphasized that near-unanimous liberal bias was a \\"conformity, not a conspiracy\\". <br /> <br />Well, things are much worse today.  Liberal media moguls really do conspire now, even if there are some cracks in the wall. <br /> <br />Brent Bozell sure does have timing - a ticka ticka ticka ticka. <br /> <br />His book on liberal media bias appears to have been finished before the onset of the current political campaigns and was probably timed for release toward the end of an election year.  But only in Bozell's dreams could it have come out at roughly the same time that Dan Rather and the honchos at CBS got caught with their pants down trying to use forged documents to do the nasty to George W. Bush. <br /> <br />As if that weren't enough, this book also coincides with Matt Drudge's unearthing of the memo written by ABC Political Director Mark Halperin to his staff, which virtually amounted to a \\"how-to\\" campaign manual for the Kerry candidacy. <br /> <br />Liberals and leftists are forever using the fiction of opposition and identity with the underdog for self-promotion.  So they don't respond very well when they are in control and are loathe to acknowledge actually being in control, preferring to manufacture opposition and oppression. <br /> <br />Most liberals deny that there is, in fact, a liberal news media bias, but this is nothing more than pseudo-sophisticated flat-earthism.  Even without the two aforementioned recent examples, one would have to be living in a cave not to see how the mainstream media has been co-opted as another arm of the Kerry campaign.  This reviewer, by the way, is not voting for either Bush or Kerry. <br /> <br />Bozell starts out very strongly - hitting on the head all of the arguments that are conventionally used to bely the existence of liberal news media bias:  1) what about conservative commentators/talk-radio? 2) the news media is owned by corporate conglomerates 3) not ALL conservatives believe in the boogeyman and 4) look how mean everyone was to poor old Al Gore. <br /> <br />But as the book advances, Bozell often makes the same mistake that liberals make when raising the talk-radio red herring.  His response to argument (1) is appropriate:  there is a difference between openly-ideological commentators who overtly seek to persuade (some are conservative and some are liberal) and reporters who try to disguise biased commentary as objective analysis (almost monolithically liberal). <br /> <br />Yet much of Bozell's criticism is directed towards morning-show personalities such as Bryant Gumbel and Katie Couric, who seem to be his favorite targets.  They're both leftist, mean-spirited, and mentally-challenged fluff-deliverers, but no one regards them as anything other than commentators. <br /> <br />Still, Bozell never wanders that far from the target - reinforcing the standard analyses of media slant delivered by Rothman and Lichter, by Bernard Goldberg in his own book on the subject, and by Bozell's Media Research Center.  He also provides a wealth of anecdotal evidence of liberal double standards that will make your blood boil. <br /> <br />Having said all that, I think that it's over-simplistic to analyze news media using a pure left-right dichotomy.  Media is at least as woman-centered as it is liberal-centered.  The two concepts are often synonymous:  what passes for liberal ideology today is largely emotion-centered (i.e., female) pap.  That explains the sentiment for gun control, where logic and objective analysis tend to show that it doesn't work. <br /> <br />But the news media isn't always as anti-gun as Bozell thinks.  Yeah, they USUALLY cover gun stories from a Million-Soccer-Mom-March earth-mother perspective, ranting against bad men with guns.  But when the discussion turns to FEMALE ownership of guns, guns don't seem so bad.These stories are inevitably written from a female-empowerment perspective. <br /> <br />Women shooting men doesn't sound particularly \\"liberal\\", but clearly women are virtuous whether they seek to eliminate guns or shoot men, who, of course, are never virtuous.  This is just one example of a women-good/men-bad mindset that dominates media and popular culture and actually trumps conventional leftism. <br /> <br />Bozell expresses optimism that the wall of liberal news media bias is being torn down.  He bases this cheerfulness on public skepticism about news sources, the emergence of Fox News as an alternative source, and the strength of conservative philosophy. <br /> <br />Amazingly enough, as recently as this book was completed, Bozell does NOT anticipate the blogocracy that brought Dan Rather to his knees.  Conservative publications are now bubbling with the proliferation of web-page addresses of pajama-clad warriors looking for fresh game.  Hugh Hewitt is their Schwarzkopf, and THESE are probably the best weapons against the liberal overlords that rule mainstream media. <br /> <br />Beyond that, I think that Bozell is somewhat nave.  The human mind is very easily fooled and people do not have to BELIEVE what they are receiving from mainstream media in order to find themselves acting on it. <br /> <br />Fox News might be more balanced, but Rupert Murdoch is too sordid and Fox's entertainment programming is filled with as much filth as that of its competitors.  Fox's emergence as a fourth network hasn't exactly spawned a rebirth of wholesome entertainment.  Clearly, Fox is not a reliable conservative warhorse. <br /> <br />And as for conservative philosophy, it is indeed more well-grounded in nature and logic than is liberalism.  That's not proof that it's going to prevail against a still-entrenched liberal mainstream media and pop culture.  As a conservative, Bozell shouldn't be such a happy warrior in the face of such opposition.  Conservative philosophy requires one to walk a straight and narrow path but is cognizant of flaws in human nature that make it unlikely that many people will do so. <br /> <br />When Whittaker Chambers moved from left to right, he declared that he was joining the losing side.  Bozell forgets that to be a conservative is to have a wry pessimistic sense of humor grounded in a fatalistic view that the life of a conservative in the libertine West is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.	2004-10-18
US	50691488	RE8GV7ME4WFEY	0962719560	42062129	Jack the Ripper: Light-Hearted Friend	Books	3	3	8	N	N	Whose vorple sword?	James Maybrick was Jack the Ripper.  He was, that's all. <br /> <br />The contents of the Maybrick/Ripper Diary, which display extraordinary in-depth knowledge of both \\"May\\" and \\"Jack\\", not readily available to the public, as well as a number of other historical factors which blend in perfectly with the story unfolded by the Diary allow for no other reasonable conclusion.  James Maybrick WAS Jack the Ripper. <br /> <br />The Ripperology establishment and its groupies, however, continue to disdain the obvious, ever conducting an ostrich-like search for the \\"real\\" Ripper and looking for the \\"forger\\" of the Diary under every bed. <br /> <br />It's reminiscent of the way that shaggy leftist JFK conspiracy theorists stick their heads into black holes of grassy-knoll fantasia while lying to themselves and to the public in order to exonerate fellow leftist Lee Harvey Oswald and pin the assassination on the Right. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, Richard Wallace's book purporting to show or suggest that the Whitechapel killer was actually children's and fantasy author, Lewis Carroll, is more scholarly than given credit for. <br /> <br />Wallace himself declares an interest in the Maybrick/Ripper diary, as have other psycho-analysts, noting that the diary seems to be \\"sincere and well-done\\".  But he allows conventional Ripperology to direct his attention from the diary - which is a little like using Saudi intelligence to find Osama bin Laden.  Wallace is also misdirected by his own interest in Carroll, of course. <br /> <br />But contrary to what he has been charged with, Wallace isn't just playing word games.  Before writing this book, he wrote a different one, based on his training as a therapist, in which he describes a dark side of Lewis Carroll's persona observable behind the upbeat fantasy of his works, and the conclusions that he draws in this book are at least as much based on his therapist training as on his analysis of Ripper letters and Carroll works. <br /> <br />Wallace remarks in this book that at some point, he wondered if he had fully plummeted the uncharted depths of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson in his first book. <br /> <br />All right, Wallace DOES go awry.  He wonders if Carroll, who lived near London at the time of the Ripper murders found a vent for the suppressed rage that Wallace observes in Carroll's works, in the slaughter of Whitechapel prostitutes.  And if the terrible secret that he was holding might ITSELF need an outlet which might be encoded somewhere. <br /> <br />Carroll was a lover of anagrams - might he have hidden clues as to the Ripper's identity in any Ripper correspondence or Carroll work?  Wallace \\"anagrammatizes\\" these writings, and sure enough... <br /> <br />But as other critics have noted, the English language with 26 letters, flexible syntax, and assortment of homonyms is very malleable, and this sort of deciphering can be misused, however inadvertently.  Wallace even suggests that the introduction \\"Dear Boss\\" (from the famous \\"Dear Boss\\" letters) can be anagrammatized into \\"sob dears\\" or \\"dare boss\\" (\\"Dares was another Dodgson nom de plume) or \\"sores bad\\" (an associate of Carroll's was afflicted with gout). <br /> <br />But how does one normally start a letter WITHOUT the word \\"dear\\"?  Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. <br /> <br />Moreover, just suppose that Carroll had desired to create a work of fancy of 50 words or more and had desperately intended to write it in such a way that the letters couldn't be possibly be rearranged to indicate some unintended secret meaning.  How would he have gone about it?  Clearly, it wouldn't have been possible, and therein lies the rub. <br /> <br />Anyway, if Carroll NEEDED a confessional outlet for Ripper crimes, he could have included a non-encoded straightforward confession of them in his OWN diaries, to be released to posterity after his death, but as Wallace acknowledges, Carroll's own diaries contain no such thing. <br /> <br />No, Wallace's anagrammatic analyses can be disregarded, but he does come up with other interesting nuggets.  The \\"Eight Little Whores\\" poem, originally introduced by Donald McCormick and hinted at in the Maybrick Diary, really does have a meter similar to Carroll's \\"A Game of Fives\\", written in 1883.   <br /> <br />Assuming that the meter isn't a familiar or well-used one, does this similarity really mean that Carroll was the Ripper or does it just mean that Maybrick - I mean the Ripper - read Carroll's poem?   <br /> <br />Wallace also has an interesting idea on just where the Whitechapel killer might have gotten the pedigree for the nickname of \\"Jack\\" and even a possible pedigree for the modus operandi of the Ripper murders themselves. <br /> <br />Intelligent Maybrickians should assume the air of chess players already comfortably in the middle game of a \\"Hunt the Ripper\\" match while shrill critics scream over the dimensions of the game board.  Maybrickians should act with an eye toward history and toward a more receptive future generation of Ripper historians.  Wallace might have identified some lines of inquiry that will facilitate this. <br /> <br />Finally, Wallace might deserve some commendation for acknowledging the sustaining presence of God in his life while immersing himself in the exploration of the darkest side of the human condition.  By allowing light to flood his mind and soul, Wallace likely ensures that he himself will never become part of the Ripperology establishment.	2004-09-25

Years ago, when I thought I was a Republican, I exuberantly declared online that a powerful Republican Party could destroy the Democrats and remain in power forever. <br /> <br />I was immediately beset upon - by Republicans.  Really.  They wanted to know (seriously!) how I could think of saying such awful things about those nice Democrats.  Did I want to destroy the elegance of our lovely two-party system? <br /> <br />I was amazed.  What was the point of being a Republican if it didn't mean prevailing over Democrats as often as possible?  Is there a Democrat ALIVE who doesn't yearn for his own version of a one-party state? <br /> <br />That Republican scorn victory and that my own reactionary politics are far to the right of the GOP anyway were disillusioning, but my interest recently perked up again when I glanced at this book by Hugh Hewitt. <br /> <br />I remembered him as a mild-mannered talk show host that I had once listened to, but clearly Hewitt is a Republican who wants to ALWAYS WIN.  This by itself was enough to justify the purchase of this book, even if Hewitt and his party ARE too far to the left. <br /> <br />The trouble was that I hadn't seen Hewitt's terms and conditions.  The war is EVERYTHING, he explains in his introduction, and the Republican establishment wages it better.  If the war is a second-tier issue to you, he inveighs, don't bother to buy his book.  Well, I'm awfully sorry, Hugh, but the publisher somehow neglected to put that little disclaimer in the jacket cover, and I'd already paid my nickel before opening the book up and reading it. <br /> <br />Hewitt dismisses single-issues such as abortion, immigration, and gay marriage as paling in comparison before the \\"War on Terror\\" and excoriates those who would argue otherwise.  In so doing, he loses the moral high ground that he otherwise seeks to claim as an evangelical Christian. <br /> <br />One can agree generally with the proposition that mass murderers and terrorists should be apprehended and punished; that their operations should be destroyed; and that national security should be protected - and STILL regard the \\"War on Terror\\" as a fight between two bald men over possession of a comb. <br /> <br />A pro-life activist can well conclude that a society that normalizes abortion as a method of birth control and countenances millions of them is scarcely more respectful of human life than the one that it is supposed to be at war with. <br /> <br />A culture vulture might look at the vanity of Western society and conclude that a culture which could give rise to the Brittney/Madonna French kiss is in no position to look aghast at the concept of women in burkha. <br /> <br />And one commentator on the Web - an evangelical Christian, just as Hewitt claims to be - quotes from Deuteronomy in the same Bible that Hewitt reads and declares that a nation defended by her women is not a nation worth defending.  Some of us feel disgraced at having been \\"defended\\" by Jessica Lynch and Lyddie England. <br /> <br />By disdaining such concerns, Hewitt contradicts his own faith and weakens any moral argument that he would make on behalf of the salvation of the West or of the urgency that he would assign to the \\"War on Terror\\". <br /> <br />Of course, many readers WILL accept Hewitt's pre-condition that \\"the war is everything\\" and will agree that Republicans are more capable of successfully waging it than are Democrats.  But even those readers might have problems with Hewitt's ham-handed attempt to subordinate all political instincts to the will of the GOP establishment.  Not all conservatives or Republicans agree that waging war on Iraq is instrumental to the fight against terrorism. <br /> <br />And Hewitt castigates conservatives in Pennsylvania who sought to replace liberal Republican Arlen Specter with conservative Pat Toomey as the GOP nominee.  Why?  Well - uh - because not everyone would vote for Toomey in November.  Then isn't your quarrel with them, Hugh,instead of with Pennsylvanians who have the effrontery to demand that the Republicans represent conservative voters? <br /> <br />With true elitist indifference, Hewitt castigates Main Street Republicans for ideological purity that threatens to divide the party, while ignoring the most prominent threat to the Republican Party - the massive influx of immigrants across the southwestern border.   <br /> <br />This is hardly a recipe for the continued viability of the Republican Party OR for security from terror attacks, LET ALONE an example of classical conservatism from an Edmund Burke/Russell Kirk perspective.  But it's being promoted by the most powerful Republican in the country under the guise of \\"compassionate conservatism\\". <br /> <br />Hewitt glares disdainfully through his green eyeshade at relatively powerless ideological purists and single-issue fanatics (his own passion for the war not falling under these categories, of course) for possibly alienating a few moderate Democrats who might otherwise be persuaded to jump ship.  He ignores the far more politically-suicidal pro-immigration posture taken by a Republican administration that seems to be determined to import millions of future Democrats. <br /> <br />In fact, immigration is one of those \\"divisive\\" social issues that Hewitt wants to just go away. <br /> <br />I'm also not sure that I understand Hewitt's attempt to distinguish the personal from the political.  Democratic policies can get us all killed by the terrorists, but on the other hand, some of his best friends are Democrats.  Why?  Why make friends with people whose  criminal negligence might kill you? <br /> <br />Loyal Republicans will appreciate Hewitt's history of Democratic corruption, as well as the clarity and simplicity of his primer on how to successfully organize on behalf of Republican politics. <br /> <br />But just as foreign policy hawks correctly remarked, as the 20th century came to a close, that war would prove to be not so far removed from a world that appeared to be at peace, Hewitt and others like him might want to consider that when a country IS at war, socio-cultural issues - which raise concerns about what exactly sort of society we are fighting for - do NOT conveniently recede.	2004-09-23
US	50691488	RPPGR0MFITW78	0691057338	435913715	Baseball in Blue and Gray: The National Pastime during the Civil War	Books	4	9	11	N	N	Baseball - outlined against a blue, gray historical backdrop	George Kirsch's book about baseball during the middle of the 19th century, particularly the Civil War years, is a little too scholarly and a little too detailed to be considered light reading, in spite of its fairly small size.    But it's still a very engaging book, which will inform and entertain reasonably literate baseball fans (yes, I know these often seem scarce).    The Abner Doubleday legend was put to bed long ago, as was the myth that Lincoln, on his deathbed, begged Doubleday to keep baseball alive (with a bullet lodged 6 inches in his brain, Lincoln never regained consciousness after being shot).    Still, traditionalists will find much to cheer, for in place of these legends, and in a relatively short space, Kirsch provides a wealth of information that actually does establish baseball as a uniquely American activity.    The traditionally English pastime of rounders is of distant ancestry to American baseball, more so than cricket, but as Kirsch notes - citing Henry Chadwick - baseball modified and improved in the United States to an extent almost to deprive it of any or its original features beyond the mere groundwork of the game.    Chadwick's name comes up frequently in this volume, and Kirsch provides information justifying the present-day consensus that the English-born American-raised Chadwick was the \\"father\\" of modern-day baseball - having extensively promoted the game, worked assiduously in an effort to keep it free of corruptive elements such as gambling, and invented the first set of statistics and box scores to record and summarize the action.    There is apparently no reliable evidence of Lincoln participating in or actively following baseball during his life, but the mystiques conjured in the imagination by both Lincoln and baseball almost demand a legendary connection between the two.  The fictitious dying wish expressed by Lincoln to Doubleday is undoubtedly wish-fulfillment.    Kirsch does provide some contemporary anecdotal evidence connecting Lincoln with baseball.  This includes one amusing political cartoon in which Lincoln and the three defeated presidential candidates from the 1860 election assume the easy poses of \\"strikers\\" and use baseball terminology to describe their respective views of the campaign. In this cartoon, John Breckenridge remarks that old Abe was able to make such a \\"good lick\\" because he had that \\"confounded rail to strike with\\".    The stories about baseball being played by both Union and Confederate soldiers among themselves or even against each other in between battles and in prison camps apparently have a great deal of truth to them - at least during the first two years of the war when the carnage was relatively light and provisions were relatively ample.      Interestingly enough, baseball was also played largely without interruption by many of the same amateur club members and fraternal organization members who had competed before the war - those who were able to delay or avoid military service.  There are even recorded histories of baseball games being played by slaves on southern plantations.    Every time this country undergoes a national crisis, or even a local one, such as the San Francisco earthquake of 1989 - a segment of the population always decries the continuation of sporting events as unseemly and insensitive.    In this context, the fact that amateur baseball (the concept of professionals playing for monetary gain was largely unheard of at the time) continued largely unabated during the most bloody national crisis in American history should provide food for thought.  Benefits from the proceeds were often donated to the war effort and remembrances acknowledged as part of the game ceremonies, as would later be the case during other crises from World War I to September 11.    Another thing that I found both informative and pleasing addresses the arguments made by today's pseudo-traditionalists like George Will, who insist that baseball was MEANT to be a unending game proceeding at a snail's pace concomitant with the lengthy passage of time on a sultry summer afternoon - and who oppose all efforts to speed up the game on that basis.    Contemporary newspaper accounts of baseball from this era make clear that the reason why America so passionately adopted baseball as its own unique brand of recreation - and why it was favorably regarded by military authorities as a pastime for soldiers was the strenuousness and fast pace of the 19th century game.    One commentator alludes to baseball as \\"an admirable preliminary school\\" for attaining the qualifications of a first-rate soldier because its practice enhanced \\"the endurance of bodily fatigue and the cultivation of activity of movement.\\"    How 19th century baseball fans would regard today`s \\"hurlers\\" who stall endlessly between pitches and who throw incessantly to first base, as well as today`s \\"strikers\\" who pass interminable time preparing themselves outside of the batter's box is anyone's guess.	2004-09-23

He insists that Charles \\"Sparky\\" Schultz was forever a St. Paul, Minnesota native at heart, even if commercial considerations necessitated Schultz's leaving his hometown for Santa Rosa, California.<br /><br />As part of his proof, Keillor refers to the snow fall on Snoopy's doghouse - a more likely phenomenon in St. Paul than in Santa Rosa.<br /><br />Maybe, but Schultz apparently became a San Francisco Giants fan after arriving in Northern California - witness Charlie Brown's agonized cry \\"Why couldn't McCovey have hit the ball three feet higher?\\" in the wake of the disheartening ending to the 1962 World Series.<br /><br />And the utter futility of Giants fandom is perfectly consistent with the sense of ineffectuality that Charlie Brown experienced on a regular basis.  When Schultz died in 2000, he mercifully missed the Giants' snatch of defeat from the jaws of victory in the 2002 World Series, which undoubtedly would have added to both Charlie Brown's and Charlie Schultz's sense of futility.<br /><br />David Michaelis's afterward to this collection is considerably more absurd.  Using quotes from the unspeakably evil Jules Feiffer and the even more unspeakably evil Garry Trudeau, Michaelis actually portrays the \\"Peanuts\\" comic strip as a \\"beat\\" strip, a \\"subversive\\" work of art that rebels against what he regards as the sense of conformity and alienation of America in the 1950's.<br /><br />Michaelis seems to be taking it for granted that his readers will universally agree that the \\"conformity\\" of 1950's America - if that's what it was - was a BAD thing, instead of a beneficial phenomenon that checked excesses and created a healthy framework of hierarchy and order.<br /><br />There is certainly some truth to the observation that Peanuts did evolve into some sort of insurgent comic strip, though it's clear from the interview with Charles Schultz that is included within this volume that this was hardly how he intended for it to be perceived.<br /><br />But if \\"Peanuts\\" did metamorphose, it was during the 1960's when developments such as the addition of a bird named Woodstock and the evolution of Linus from Lucy's baby brother to blanket-toting pop-culture philosopher and Snoopy's inclination to \\"trip\\" on a number of fantasies gave the strip more of a \\"mod\\" image.<br /><br />So Michaelis's critique is utterly beside the point.  The beauty of THIS collection of Peanuts cartoons - ranging from 1950 to 1952 - is that the cartoons aren't \\"hip\\" at all.<br /><br />The children in this strip really do resemble children - albeit children with unusually great abilities and vocabularies.  But they react instinctively as children and not as little adults.  Lucy is an engaging little kewpie doll with big eyes and not the mean-spirited fussbudget that would later more famously distinguish her character.<br /><br />Charlie Brown has insecurities to be sure and a tendency to over-intellectualize simple events, but he's still a feisty little guy whose insecurities don't prevent him from dishing out as much punishment as he receives.  This is actually evident in the defiant frown that he's wearing on the cover of this book.<br /><br />In one cartoon, Lucy ungratefully asks C.B. what took him so long to bring her the glass of water that he agreed to fetch for her, and he responds by methodically pouring it on her head.  There are a number of incidents like this, and clearly Charlie Brown has not yet become the \\"born loser\\" who passively suffers abuse because he feels that it's no more than his due.<br /><br />Snarling husky gender-bending Peppermint Patty and her partner Marcie have not yet arrived - have, no doubt, not yet even been CONCEIVED - to enable Schultz to mouth politically-correct feminist bromides as a means of paying homage to the goddess that dominates all public conversation.  Schultz hasn't yet sold out his artistic integrity for this purpose.<br /><br />Snoopy is a delicious little puppy dog who also responds to events as a puppy would.  He hasn't yet become the non-conformist who sleeps ON TOP OF his doghouse or the idle visionary who fantasizes himself as any one of a number of human action figures - as anything at all, but a dog.

US	50691488	R2FGBCIBIHX03I	0679430687	785444807	The New Yorker Book of Lawyer Cartoons	Books	4	16	19	N	Y	Reflections of the way law's going to be	I'm surprised at how small this collection is.  Attorneys are such an inviting target for comedic attacks that it amazes me that as long as the New Yorker has been around, it only found about 85 attorney cartoons worthy of collection into this 1993 edition and that it hasn't found enough worthy cartoons since then to fill out a second edition. <br /> <br />Originality isn't a feature point of this New Yorker collection of cartoons, but talent is. <br /> <br />The 85 attorney cartoons largely revolve around two themes.  One is surrealistic art which makes attorneys look as uncharacteristically undignified as possible (many of which are variations on the old \\"shark\\" joke that shows attorneys in the open water with fins and teeth). <br /> <br />The other is animated commentary on the ubiquitousness of attorneys in everyday life, a ubiquitousness that deprives each attorney of his individuality (\\"Would everyone check to see if they have an attorney?\\" asks a meeting-organizer.  \\"I seem to have ended up with two.\\") <br /> <br />As I say though, the talent of the cartoonists is great enough that the same joke can be replayed several times and still retain a certain amount of freshness each time. <br /> <br />Still, the funniest cartoons are those which break the mold and display some actual knowledge about the profession such as the courtroom setting on the moon, in which judge, jury, and counsel are dutifully wearing spacesuits.  The spaceships that transported them there are displayed in the background.  \\"Not ANOTHER change of venue, counselor,\\" the judge protests to one forceful advocate. <br /> <br />But as for the garden-variety attorney jokes, to my mind as a member of the bar myself, the joke is always on the jokester.   <br /> <br />The public that enjoys these cartoons hates attorneys so much that they place their kids on an ever-increasing basis into law school and hire attorneys with the same frequency, expecting their own attorneys to engage in the same tacticsthat they would object to in anyone else's attorney.  The public even hates attorneys enough to recently forgive an attorney who happened to be President of the United States for criminal and unethical conduct in a litigation setting. <br /> <br />Sure, this collection has a funny wedding-cake cartoon, in which the plastic bride-and-groom at the top of the cake are both accompanied by their respective plastic lawyers.  In a world in which the divorce rate approaches 50 percent and pre-nups are necessary legal insurance, the bride and groom have created the need for counsel. <br /> <br />Sure, there's a cartoon in this collection that shows attorneys sold over the grocery counter in six-packs.  Since 1993, at least one organization has taken to marketing legal services on a multi-level marketing basis in the same way that Amway or Herbalife market health products.  Legal services ARE becoming like food, drink and health to the public. <br /> <br />Who creates such demand?  Who's responsible for the proliferation of attorneys?  The cartoonists who lampoon us and the public who laughs at the lampoons; that is, you, me and all of us because we've created the demand for that which we outwardly disdain.  And I have a feeling that the cartoonists themselves know this. <br /> <br />It's OK to laugh at cleverly-delivered jokes ostensibly directed at the legal profession, but you'll probably enjoy the jokes more if you don't peer too closely to see if the joke isn't really on you.	2004-08-31

The controversy that has existed for some twelve or thirteen years over the Ripper Diary is remarkable. Recently, I watched a special on Discovery Channel about dinosaurs - specifically over the paleontologists' controversy concerning whether the Tyrannosaurus Rex was a predator or a scavenger. <br /> <br />The recurring arguments were made civilly enough, and at the end, a consensus was starting to form.  It was a startling reminder that it really is possible for academics to disagree with one another without coming to blows. <br /> <br />This book about the Ripper Diary isn't for beginners. The authors presuppose that their readers will be familiar generally with the reputedly \\"unsolved\\" murder mystery that is Jack the Ripper and the controversy surrounding the bona-fides of the \\"Ripper Diary\\" and the \\"Ripper Watch\\" that both identify Jack as Liverpool cotton broker, James Maybrick, as well as the salient points regarding the diary and the watch, the facts of the Ripper case, and the facts of James Maybrick's life. <br /> <br />They also presuppose that the reader has read all previous books written about the Ripper Diary, including the Shirley Harrison and Paul Feldman books and Anne Barrett's book about the life of Florence Maybrick. <br /> <br />A number of years ago, under a different screen name, I predicted that history would indeed proclaim that James Maybrick was Jack the Ripper on the strength of the Diary, which would ultimately be acknowledged as genuine - but that there was too much contentiousness in the field of \\"Ripper Studies\\" to expect this to happen in our lifetime. <br /> <br />This book certainly supports that prediction. Jack the Ripper devotees do not have the ability that paleontologists do to put aside their differences in the common interest of expanding knowledge.  This book's \\"inside story\\" of the Ripper Diary is largely one of annihilation of the people closest to the diary. <br /> <br />The lion's share of blame falls on the diary's detractors, who seem to have borrowed or anticipated the Clinton/Carville game plan of using the politics of intellectual dishonesty and personal destruction as a weapon against the diary and its proponents. This book recounts how they portray the diary as an ancient forgery when that suits their needs and as a modern forgery when it becomes time to again shift the goalposts. <br /> <br />It recounts how Melvin Harris, the private detective that Harris uses as his goon, segments of the Ripperology establishment, and their followers from the Casebook bulletin board accuse everyone remotely connected with the diary of having \\"forged\\" it. It recounts how, like a modern-day Inquisition, these people harass their suspects, attempt to coerce confessions from them, and then as cowards and bullies have done since time immemorial, cry \\"foul\\" when their targets defend themselves or retaliate.  <br /> <br />The anti-diary camp has used its numbers and abused the legal system to turn mere belief in the authenticity of the diary or even belief in it as an item of historical interest into an Orwellian thought-crime, and this is a principal reason why this reviewer has extricated himself from active involvement with the controversy. <br /> <br />But if the book shows that many diary antagonists are bad people, it also shows how those closest to the diary have been criminally stupid or inept.  Those within the pro-diary camp might have been expected to band together against the monsters trying to silence them. <br /> <br />Instead, we see them foolishly allowing their already small numbers to split into smaller factions on the basis of varying financial interests.  The book's authors, by the way, spend too much time discussing these financial interests.  I doubt that anyone is interested in as much detail as the book provides.  Still, as a result, there is a paucity of cooperation between the competing factions WITHIN the pro-diary camp. <br /> <br />A major flaw in this book is thattoo much time is spent castigating Paul Feldman for his role in this schism, for the clumsiness of his method of investigation, and for his tendency to jump to conclusions too quickly.  The criticisms may well be just, but notwithstanding Feldman's flaws, not enough credit is given to him for discoveries that buttressed the Ripper-Maybrick connection. <br /> <br />In particular, there is no mention whatsoever of the very real possibility, advanced by Feldman, that Albert Johnson, owner of the Ripper watch, is himself a Maybrick descendant. <br /> <br />More prominent examples of foolishness from the diary camp include Michael Barrett's alcohol-induced on-again, off-again \\"confession\\" of having himself \\"forged\\" the diary, as well as his estranged wife Ann's too-lengthy silence concerning her knowledge of the diary's origins and her ridiculously clumsy attempts to palm the diary off on her husband without his knowing of her involvement.  These are the very activities which probably render impossible full rehabilitation of the diary in our lifetime. <br /> <br />Mrs. Barrett (nee` Graham), by the way, defends her actions and her indifference to the diary's story on the grounds of its irrelevance to her personal concerns, as well as the vast number of atrocities that have occurred since the Ripper murders in 1888.  Interestingly enough, as I write this in 2004, London is again being stalked by a serial killer - who uses a hammer.  Mrs. Barrett should have considered that if the Ripper Diary is accepted as authentic, the tortured story that it tells may shed light on the very issue which concerns her:  the inhumanity that humans often inflict on one another. <br /> <br />This hardly qualifies as empirical reasoning, but one could almost make a case for the Diary being a genuine relic of Jack the Ripper SOLELY on the basis of the human cost that the Diary has exacted over a century after James Maybrick was laid in his grave.  This human cost is also almost enough to convince one of the soundness of the mystic's belief that evil is a tangible factor which can survive an individual's death and rest in an inanimate artifact.  Only God knows whether this human cost actually results from the depravity of the dead or of the living.	2004-08-22

However, they apparently have generated enough interest (and the amount of available material is voluminous enough) to have kept Ms. Rehart busy for a number of years, and these radio spots have been collected on an ongoing basis as material for her \\"Legends and Legacies\\" series of books. <br /> <br />This is the 3rd in the series, and, in this particular volume, as always, while the city of Fresno might be the most prominent city in the region, Ms. Rehart is also careful to include stories centered in surrounding areas such as Hanford, Coalinga, Selma, and Madera.  These renewed in me a determination to visit some of the historical landmarks located in these areas. <br /> <br />Fresno is still the source of most of Ms. Rehart's folklore, and the story of \\"Night Riders in the Valley\\" describing how as recently as the 1920's, gangs of vigilantes were roaming the area coercing independent raisin growers to affiliate with the Sun-Maid cooperative reminds the reader of how recently Fresno was an untamed frontier town. <br /> <br />And, as always, her forays into the world of sports are appreciated.  Of special interest was her story about the 1958 Fresno High School Warriors baseball team, which would produce four future major league ballplayers, including two twenty-game winners.  <br /> <br />Ms. Rehart also includes her usual share of unintentionally funny minutiae, which really doesn't add to the Valley's historical legacy.  Does it really enlighten us to know that Parlier High School graduates have the longest running class reunion, meeting continuously on the first Wednesday of every month? <br /> <br />And the story of the history of Fresno's Lincoln-Mercury dealership strikes me as more of a paid advertisement than as genuine tradition. <br /> <br />Of course, this volume (all of Ms. Rehart's volumes, really)has its share of femi-sexism.  Accomplishments of individual females are accredited to the female sex as a whole.  The vastly more numerous and weighty accomplishments of individual MALES are accredited to...the individual males themselves, of course.  Not to the male sex, as a whole.  But this is par for the course in anything that you'll read or hear about today involving men and women. <br /> <br />\\"A Woman Named Marjaree\\" - Ms. Rehart's story about a female victim of domestic violence for whom a domestic violence shelter and counseling center was named is based on an incident that took place in 1978.  So it isn't genuine history at all; it's boob-bait for KMJ's femi-nazi listeners. <br /> <br />But femi-sexism in Western culture is like the smog hovering in the Central Valley air.  It may be harmful, but it's ubiquitous and obdurate.  The vast majority of Ms. Rehart's tales of the Central Valley are enjoyable and informative, and it would be unjust to assign too much blame to her for carrying a universal germ.	2004-08-07

The same character inveighs against LITERACY in the same breath.  He is obviously not speaking in the author's voice.<br />The law can be too intrusive at times, sometimes humorously so, and this book contains its share of yet-unrepealed \\"blue laws\\" that provide comic relief but that inevitably are delivered without explanation.  No one ever explains WHY it's illegal to own a hippopotamus in Los Angeles or to put graffiti on someone else's cow in Texas or to gurgle in public in Hot Springs, Arkansas.  It's funnier to leave the explanations to the reader's imagination.<br />But surely the prohibition in Montreal against watering one's garden while it's raining is a water conservation measure.  Surely, the stricture in Kentucky against using reptiles during religious services is a response to the dangers posed by certain snake-handling sects.  The humor is lost once the reasoning is discerned.<br />While this edition includes its share of lawyer-bashing jokes and homilies (\\"Lawyers are like physicians,\\" says Yiddish author Sholom Aleichem.  \\"What one says, the other contradicts\\"), it is clearly no more of a lawyer-bashing fest than are Larry Wilde's joke books, for example, an attack on the Jews or the Irish.<br />A number of the humorous observations in here are actually directed against the principals in the legal system, rather than the practitioners.  No one has yet been able to discover a single instance of a lawyer putting a gun to a litigant's head and forcing him to retain counsel, and as Gore Vidal observes, \\"For certain people after fifty, litigation takes the place of sex\\".<br />There would be no demand for lawyers in the first place if humans were angels.  One witness explains in a transcript of an actual court hearing included in this book, \\"The pedestrian had no idea which direction to go, so I ran over him\\".<br />A rueful plaintiff might observe that his lawyer didn't \\"give\\" him bad advice - \\"I paid for it\\".  But Daniel Webster also observes in this same volume, \\"Most good lawyers live well, work hard, and die poor.\\"<br />The book also reveals more than the author might have intended about the profound effect that the study and practice of law has on those who engage in it.<br />There is a true-to-life transcript of a lawyer asking the mother of a minor child if she has been his mother for all of his life.  There is another excerpt where a lawyer asks a witness what she was doing at the time that her child was conceived and yet another where a lawyer asks a threatened witness if the defendant killed him.<br />The uninformed among the readers are going to assume that the lawyers in question are either drunk, insane, or magnificently stupid.  But those who have actually been through the wringers that are the study and practice of law willunderstand that these fauxes pas result from the tortuous steps that an attorney learns to take when building a \\"foundation\\".  They are actually a result of too MUCH care taken during the witness's examination, not too LITTLE.<br />It's said that after Desiderius Erasmus published his \\"Praise of Folly\\", he became disillusioned after an associate suggested that he write another volume praising wisdom - because Erasmus thought that he had already done just that.<br />A similar finding can be made regarding the \\"attack\\" on the legal profession that is made in this book.	2004-07-04

If there were a plot to provoke an attack that would bring America into the war, would not the attack itself have served the interests of the plotters without need for the loss of life that resulted from unpreparedness on December 7?<br />Were Roosevelt and his commanders really so indifferent to human life as to allow naval personnel to die needlessly in order to &quot;gild the lily&quot; that the attack itself otherwise would have provided?<br />It looks as though the Left needs to clean its own house.  It looks like they have their own &quot;911&quot; because Stinnett's evidence in the form of broken Japanese codes, tracking of warships, and government warnings that somehow never quite made it to the &quot;intended&quot; recipients at Pearl Harbor suggests that the Roosevelt administration was indeed so indifferent.<br />But the &quot;smoking gun&quot; drama that Stinnett's revelations should invoke is muted in a hodge-podge of footnotes and appendices that make this book very difficult to read or evaluate.  A number of characters strut and fret their way upon the historical stage that Stinnett lights without making a firm impression as to either their identities or to the role that they play on this stage.  There is certainly enough information here, however, for others to examine and perhaps to present in more readable format.<br />Actually, it really isn't even necessary to discuss Pearl Harbor when considering the issue of FDR's indifference to human life.  The internment of thousands of American citizens of Japanese descent in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor, pursuant to Roosevelt's executive order, is not a disputed factual issue at all and itself illustrates this indifference.<br />Although there are yet living survivors of Pearl Harbor and of the internment, the incidents that took place over sixty years ago almost themselves fade before the issue of why Roosevelt's historical reputation is scarcely affected by what has always been known about the internment and by ongoing revelations about Pearl Harbor, just as JFK's historical reputation scarcely suffers in the eyes of historians or the general public from what is now KNOWN about his connections with the Mob.<br />Orwell once wrote that he who controls the past controls the future, and our past seems to be controlled by liberal/Left academics that censor and rewrite history in order to maintain a liberal/Left consensus.<br />Orwell also wrote that the prospect that the ruling classes might convince their subjects that two plus two equals something other than four frightened him more than bombs.  The fact that liberal leaders with deeply-ingrained, sometimes criminal flaws, are STILL being portrayed by \\"history\\" as examples of moral uplift is an example of liberal/Left academics and weak sisters among the general public decreeing that two plus two equals five whenever it's necessary.<br />Perhaps after 60 years, our emphasis should shift away somewhat from the possibility of government conspiracies from bygone days and should focus on the active conspiracies to control the past that are actively and openly taking place in the halls of academia.	2004-07-04

On the enlightened shores of Amsterdam, they, along with others, make their living in commodities trading, and how remarkably little this activity has since changed over four centuries.<br />As they do now, traders gamble over the rise and fall of prices by buying and selling \\"puts\\" (an option giving one the right to sell at a later date for an artificially-high price) and \\"calls\\", (an option giving one the right to buy at a later date for an artificially-low price).  Having once briefly dabbled in commodities trading, I am familiar with these strategies but never before imagined that they were anything other than 20th-century innovations.<br />Yet at one stage, one trader cynically advises another, \\"Go buy whale oil - not futures, but the thing itself.  You may remember that the rest of the world still transacts business in that quaint manner.\\"<br />The story specifically centers around the efforts of one trader in particular, Miguel Lienzo, who is introduced to a wondrous new fruit called \\"coffee\\" that when ground and brewed into drink imparts astonishing powers of reason and concentration and also has the power to preserve health, help digestion, and cure consumption and other maladies of the lung, as well as fluxes, jaundice and inflammation.  One character in the novel naively crunches this \\"fruit\\" between her teeth before learning of its greater appeal as a brew.<br />Anticipating a tremendous demand for this new commodity, Miguel arrives at a plan to use his trading acumen to acquire a monopoly on it, all the while juggling business and personal affairs that threaten to undo him before his plan comes to fruition.  These affairs include Miguel's need to resolve the conflict between the duty of honesty and fidelity that Jewish law imposes upon him with the harsh realities of life on the Exchange and outside the Exchange.They also include the Ma'amad, the self-regulatory Jewish body that actually adopts some of the Inquisition's methods for the greater good of the community.<br />As we follow Miguel's progress, we also note the presence of affable moneylender, Alonzo Alferonda, a victim of \\"cherem\\" (excommunication from the Jewish community at the hands of the Ma'amad), manipulating events behind the background - though the extent and the purpose of this manipulation is not revealed until the end.<br />Commodities trading in the year 1659 is essentially a product of rumor and the uses to which it is put, and in an environment unregulated by any sort of futures trading commission, false rumors are used to manipulate the market but are used sparingly lest their sources be regarded as completely untrustworthy for future purposes.<br />In such a world, the dividing line between what is real and what only APPEARS real is often sketchy, and this uncertainty is symbolic of a similar dichotomy of the events in Miguel's life.  Who are his friends and who are his enemies?  To what extent will his understanding of this be turned on its head by the end of the novel?<br />Does coffee really have a medicinal power to keep us alert and vital, especially now that it comes freeze-dried and/or packaged?  Or do we drink it in the morning now out of force of habit?  It has since become the definitive American drink and has been so for some time, but I'm actually not aware that it has produced a nation of alert and vital people.<br />Still, having read this novel, I know that I, for one, will never again regard my morning \\"cuppa\\" in quite the same way.	2004-06-07

It was actually a time in which she could expect to receive a measure of legal and moral reprobation for her actions.  Indeed, it was a time when men weren't even universally regarded as worthless, simply for having been born male, and some regarded their lives as having purpose and value.  It was a time when millions of people across the country actually found themselves praying for the speedy recovery of the male victim and even lionizing HIM as the hero.<br />This was the historical setting in which deranged Baseball Annie, Ruth Steinhagen, shot Philadelphia Phillie first baseman Eddie Waitkus.  John Theodore's book largely describes what happened to both the assailant and her victim after the shooting, though, of course, he also includes a pre-shooting biography of both of them.<br />As a misogynist and a baseball fan, I would find it easy to simply regard this book as being the story of woman who committed the unpardonable crime of not only shooting a man - but a male baseball player yet.<br />Yet - and this is to Theodore's credit - he brings home the realities of Steinhagen's obsession with Eddie Waitkus forcefully enough that even this reader could empathize with it, and I did find myself taking as much interest in Steinhagen's story as I did in Waitkus's.<br />This reader himself has undergone two or three experiences in which he found himself strongly obsessed to the point of distraction with an unattainable member of the opposite sex - none of which, I hasten to add, ever had the potential of becoming harmful.  But by giving his readers a glimpse into the stark and chilling world of a mind trapped in such a grip, Theodore provided this reader with a glimpse into a mind that once resembled his own - differing (however greatly) only in the strength and emphasis of the grip that seized it.<br />The experience gave me a there-but-for-the-grace-of-God-go-I sensation and strengthened my resolve never again to walk that path.  I actually would have liked to read more about Steinhagen - her mental health was restored and she is alive today - than Theodore actually provided, and I imagine that Theodore would have liked to have written more about her.  But the book is largely about Waitkus, presumably because there is more information about him in the public record and because people close to him (this is obviously not a surprise) were more willing to talk than were people close to Steinhagen (attempts to contact Steinhagen herself were rebuffed).<br />I was going to give this book 4 stars on the basis of the author's workmanlike acquisition and delineation of the facts but the Waitkus story, as Theodore weaved it, \\"grew\\" on me the more that I read into it.<br />Of the World War II generation, Waitkus himself was a corking good ballplayer - though not a Hall of Famer.  But he was the best defensive first baseman of his era, one who sprayed the ball around for singles and doubles - more J.T. Snow than Lou Gehrig.  There was nothing remarkable about his personality - which appears to have been of a blunt, yet affable character, which philosophically took life, including the tragedies that he suffered, as it was dealt to him.  Kilroy in a major-league uniform - he would not be greatly remembered today as anything but one of many names from baseball's past, were it not for the shooting.<br />Yet there was really something almost Shakespearean about the story of his life.  His recovery from the shooting and his efforts to restore his baseball career match nicely with the rise to glory of the fabled upstart \\"Whiz Kids\\" that were the pennant-winning Philadelphia Phillies of 1950.<br />But while his physical recovery appears to have been complete and while there is no indication that Waitkus allowed himself to dwell on the past, Theodore tells a story of a man already suffering from the hidden trauma caused by several harrowing war experiences having his trauma heightened by the only experience (occurring, ironically in civilian life) where he was the victim of gunfire.<br />After arriving at the summit of fame that was his leading role on the \\"Whiz Kids\\", Waitkus, turning too often to drink for solace, suffers slow declines in his baseball career, his marriage, and in his life after baseball that culminated in his untimely death from cancer in 1972 at the age of 53.  It makes one wonder if Steinhagen's bullet didn't somehow find its target after all.<br />Yet, in his final years, he finds redemption in his continuing relationship with the children that were the product of his marriage and in being an instructor in Ted Williams's baseball camp.  Theodore actually misses the opportunity to embellish upon the irony inherent in the fact that Ted Williams had to deal with his own personal demons while he lived, but it was the book's bittersweet ending that moves it into an elite classification in my judgment.<br />One minor baseball point that Theodore missed was another brush that Waitkus had with baseball history at the end of the 1951 season, featuring a historic Giants-Dodgers pennant race.  Had Jackie Robinson not made a remarkable catch of Waitkus's low line drive in the final game between the Dodgers and the Phillies, the hit would have won the game for the Phillies and knocked the Dodgers out of the pennant race.  The Giants would have won the pennant in the regulation season, and Bobby Thomson's miracle homer in the third game of the post-season never would have happened.  Waitkus would have achieved the \\"spoiler's\\" fame later found by Joe Morgan and Gene Oliver.	2004-05-10

An octogenarian now, since this book was published in 1997, Gus became visible recently as a sometime color commentator for the Fresno Grizzlies, and I trust that Ms. Rehart has included an appropriate homage to him in one of her later volumes in this series.<br />And my curiosity has not yet been satisfied as to whether Dick's family's surname is, in fact, taken from the city of Selma - or if the city was named after one of his ancestors.<br />I don't know how they found their way to Fresno from New York in the year 1927, but there is an honest-to-God picture of Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig at a Fresno train station, posing with a Catholic priest who resembles Barry Fitzgerald.  If one didn't know better, one would swear that this was a scene out of a Hollywood movie.<br />Ms. Rehart informs her readers that other baseball luminaries such as Ty Cobb and Joe DiMaggio also visited Fresno.<br />Sports aside, Ms. Rehart's stories include the usual number of prominent citizens and exuberant frontiersman, as well as the usual struggles to combat the elements that threatened the Valley's farm produce and to maintain law and order and bring civilization to a frontier town.<br />I am slightly less enthusiastic about this volume than others because I think that there is too much focus on the area's older historic homes.  This is certainly a fit subject matter for discussion, but for those of us who are not architecturally minded or designer-minded, the various descriptions of these homes tend to blur in our minds, and there are very few pictures in this collection.  Pictures should be included of all of the old homes that have yet been preserved.<br />But this isn't a universal necessity.  The details concerning the natural disasters, the fistfights, the gun battles, and the soirees are supplied to us by our imaginations.<br />The book ends at an appropriate juncture.  I applaud the author's choice to include a description of the \\"Fresno plaque\\" - the stone carving that once stood at the entrance to the old Fresno courthouse (and now stands adjacent to the new one).   Carved in 1954, its description of the city's heritage well repays the time spent reading it and is an excellent closure to this volume.	2004-05-10

Arthur Conan Doyle's inspiration for Sherlock Holmes really did come from one of his mentors at Edinburgh University, Dr. Joseph Bell, a surgeon who discerned amazing information from strangers by observing minute details about them.<br />While Doyle came to weary of his association with the world's most famous literary detective, he shared many of Holmes's qualities, including the abilities of observation and deduction learned from Dr. Bell, and he actually did lend his efforts to the consideration of real-life mysteries from his own time.<br />Howard Engel's novel is a clever tribute to Doyle, his mentor, and his creation.  He ingeniously sets his murder mystery not in London, as might be supposed, but in Edinburgh and even more ingeniously (but inevitably, given the pecking order between Doyle and his professor) makes the youthful Doyle play Watson to Bell's Holmes.  Gratefully, Bell is a little less brusque with minds less active than his own than is Holmes.<br />Most ingeniously of all, the murder mystery that Mr. Doyle and Dr. Bell are called upon to solve is based upon a genuinely celebrated murder case from Doyle's mature years that Doyle played a principal role in resolving - though again, in this setting, as a student in the year 1879, he plays an acolyte's role.<br />Which murder case?  I leave it to the reader to see if he recognizes it from the book, if he doesn't recognize it already.  Engel himself provides the answer in his afterword.<br />I am only familiar with one other novel in which this device is used and that would be Bruce Alexander's \\"Person or Persons Unknown\\", the fourth in Alexander's Sir John Fielding Series, in which the Jack-the-Ripper slayings are moved backward 100 years in time from the late 19th century to the late 18th century.<br />Robert Louis Stevenson also makes a few cameo appearances as Doyle's college chum, and Doyle and Bell are also granted an interview with the great Disraeli (\\"Mr. Dizzy\\").  There are some annoying diversions that do not contribute to the story, and I assume that these are historical allusions that I failed to recognize.  There are certainly a number of allusions to the Sherlock Holmes stories that Doyle will later write that the reader WILL recognize.<br />I'd like to see more murder mysteries in this vein - though I'm not sure that the world is ready for a story about Oliver Stone, as a precocious fourth-grader (in Donald J. Sobol's \\"Encyclopedia Brown\\" vein), solving a mysterious shooting at a presidential motorcade in downtown Fresno during the Eisenhower years.	2004-04-09

Published in 1996, this is the first of the &quot;Legends &amp; Legacies&quot; series authored by premier Fresno/Central Valley historian Catherine Rehart.<br />A series of short clips on the history of the Central Valley, centered on (but not exclusively of) the city of Fresno, each story is apparently taken from a presentation that Rehart delivered on KMJ radio.  It is therefore not difficult to guess which radio station received its own kudos on the air and in this book for being Fresno's \\"first\\" radio station (featuring, on its opening night in 1925, such acts as \\"Spike Henessey and his Rainbow Ballroom Band, the Crockett Mountaineers of Fowler and a song called *Radio Love* written by two Fresno women\\").<br />This particular format has given the author more leisure to explore nooks and crannies of Fresno history than did the format of her illustrated history of Fresno County (\\"The Heartland's Heritage\\").<br />In evaluating \\"Heartland's Heritage\\", I had bemoaned the lack of detail given to the history of famous architectural landmarks such as the Water Tower and the Pacific-Southwest Building, but each of these buildings and many more is given its own separate treatment in this book.<br />Actually, architects and designers will find a wealth of information about the famous residences in Fresno such as the Meux Home, the Collins Home, the Swift Home, and many more.  The amount of detail lovingly furnished about these residences suggests that these aspects of Fresno history are the author's personal favorites.<br />I had expressed dismay that \\"Heartland's Heritage\\" did not delve deeply enough into the world of sports, but this volume has several sketches with a sports theme.<br />Rehart mentions that Fresno's first baseball park was at the Southern Pacific Railroad reservation at Ventura Avenue, and she exults that with the proposed site for the new baseball stadium being adjacent to this location, \\"baseball in Fresno has come full circle\\".<br />Is she talking about Grizzlie Stadium's current location on Tulare and H Streets or was a different location being considered in 1996?  Grizzlie Stadium is close enough to the railroad tracks that the engine's whistle can often be heard on game nights or game days, but I'm not 100% certain that the stadium is actually \\"adjacent\\" to this location.  Still, the notion is a very appealing historical abstraction.<br />The passage of time has overtaken at least one or two of Rehart's other observations.  She mentions that the Pacific-Southwest Building was the largest structure between San Francisco and Los Angeles until the Del Webb Building (now the County Building) was erected in the 1960's.  But the nearly-completed Federal Courthouse (ground was broken after this book was published) will edge out the Del Webb Building by a few feet.<br />However, I'm delighted to have confirmed my supposition that the courthouse, Del Webb Building, and Pacific Southwest Building will respectively rank 1-2-3 and I am equally delighted with the revelation that the three giants are all within 10-20 minutes walking distance of each other and can all be viewed at the same time if one stands at the proper angle on Tulare Street.  Downtown Fresno is truly the hub of the Central Valley, and having just driven twice through Merced County on my way to and from the San Francisco Bay Area, I am convinced that Los Banos poses no threat to this.<br />The author's sketches range from descriptions of genuine historical interest to those that are genuinely humorous or entertaining (Mayor W. Parker Lyon's \\"gift\\" to Los Angeles in 1906) to those that are awash in minutiae.<br />When she tells us breathlessly that the idea for the world's first all-inclusive liability insurance policy was drafted on a cocktail napkin in 1936 in the bar of the Hotel Fresno \\"thus adding one more important chapter to the history of Fresno\\", she seems serious (so whatever became of that cocktail napkin?).  But it reads like a MAD Magazine parody of a Catherine Rehart book.  It's funny for the wrong reasons.  But I understand that it does take a number of sketches to fill a book and to fulfill a commitment to KMJ.<br />All in all though, this is a very entertaining and informative book, which provides several illustrations that the heart and soul of Fresno continues to reside in the downtown area, however many businesses and residences have seeped their way to the north side.  As Ms. Rehart's series progresses toward the close of one century and the beginning of another, I anticipate her continuing emphasis of this theme.rody of a Catherine Rehart book.

The Water Tower is commonly regarded as Fresno Du Jour, the landmark that mapmakers and guidebook authors most readily identify with the Great Ash Tree.<br />However, this book opens with a mixture of some rustic scenes, counterbalanced by a two-page shot of the Kearney Mansion and several shots of downtown Fresno, which actually do include a close-up of the Tower on Fresno and O Streets.and the Santa Fe railroad station.  But headlined front-and-center among the opening scenes are two photos of Felchin, Shaw & Franklin's superbly-designed Pacific Southwest Building with the historic \\"Security Bank\\" wording at the base of the roof.<br />This is a terrific landmark to highlight.  There can be little doubt that if someone were to remake \\"King Kong\\" and have it set in Fresno, instead of New York, it would be at the top of the Pacific-Southwest building that Kong and the fighter planes would have their Armageddon.<br />California Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante's non-partisan love letter to Fresno, published in 2000, is fraught with some irony, not the least of which is the fact that his own connection with Fresno is somewhat tenuous.  He was born in Dinuba, California, which is not even in Fresno County, and his early years were largely spent in and around the San Joaquin area.<br />Moreover, in the most recent electoral campaign, the Central Valley as a whole was probably the least enthusiastic about his candidacy and it was here that his gubernatorial hopes were terminated.  But there's no reason to doubt his genuine affection for The Big O and the surrounding areas, as expressed in this volume, or to even suspect that this affection has been diminished by his electoral woes.<br />In fact, he exults just a little too much in his commentary.  For all of its charm and wonder, Fresno has its share of typical urban problems, and it's overstating the case just a little too much to compare it with \\"paradise\\" or to suggest that law enforcement keeps Fresno \\"safe and sound\\".<br />For that matter, was it even necessary to include photos of law enforcement officers in this particular book?  The job that they do is necessary and vital, of course, but as Thaddeus Sholto says in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's \\"Sign of the Four\\", there is nothing more unaesthetic than a policeman.  And it's not as though a picture of one from Fresno is going to differ greatly from a picture of one from Buffalo.<br />And the revitalization of downtown is in its infancy even in the year 2004, and Bustamante is no doubt waxing too enthusiastically over its progress in the year 2000.<br />But he selects most of the photos for this book with great care and includes both rural and urban settings.  And within the pictures of metropolitan Fresno and surrounding areas, there are a variety of culinary, artistic, cultural, and entertainment options to choose from.  Yes, Virginia, there is a \\"there\\" here.  What with nightclubs in the Tower District and Indian casinos in various locations, there's even a nightlife here, if one must have a nightlife.<br />The book is slightly outdated in that it shows the world-beating (well, they do their best) Fresno Grizzlies playing their home games in an uptown college stadium that they share with the FSU Bulldogs.  Downtown Grizzlie Stadium is still a glint in the eye of its designers.<br />Yet within a few miles of these metropolitan splendors, there is a young boy plunging into Kings River with all the pastoral enthusiasm of Huck Finn.  And before I grow too old, I had better set aside time to visit the Pizza Farm, where wheat, tomatoes, dairy products, peppers, and herbs - the ingredients of a pizza - are grown or raised in an eight-wedge circle.<br />The shilling of the usual big-money sponsors that foot the bill for these types of books can be best skimmed through.  If I had a nickel for every instance in which these pandering corporate goons used the word \\"diversity\\" (or some variation thereof), I'd have quite a few nickels.  What IS diversity, for God's sake?  What do you do with it?<br />However, Sun-Maid Growers of California is apparently still a grower-owned cooperative, and its story, which includes the legends of the accidental invention of the raisin, is one interesting contribution from the corporate end.  Both Fresno and nearby Selma have been known as the \\"Raisin Capital of the World\\", and the story of Sun-Maid is reminiscent of a Saroyan short story about how  the fortunes of some promoters in early 20th century Fresno rose and fell with the raisin.<br />Overall, reviewing this collection was an enjoyable experience, and Bustamante's pictorial selections are a pleasing reminder to me that much of the Central Valley is still a very large unopened book.	2004-01-23
US	50691488	R34KOYJNTFKLZP	1558593799	755200436	The Giants: Memories and Memorabilia from a Century of Baseball	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Glory in New York; fools gold in San Francisco	I bought this book, after it came out in 1993, from a terrific \\"retro\\" collectible shop in the Century City shopping center called \\"Raffia\\", which tragically exists no longer.    I don't remember why, but for some reason, I decided at the time that I would not actually open up the book and read it until after the Giants won a World Series.    Eleven years and a lifetime of heartbreak later, I realize that the Giants will win a World Series on the day after the Messiah comes riding into Jerusalem on a white donkey, blowing his shofar.    I recently found the book again and realized that I would never get to read it if I actually waited as long as I had originally intended so I just finished it.    One of the reasons why it's an interesting read is because it's written at the dawn of a new age in Giants history - on the heels of the aborted sale and move of the franchise to Tampa Bay, Florida and the subsequent purchase of the contractual services of one Barry Lamar Bonds.  So you can probably take almost all of the franchise batting records that are listed at the back of the book and throw them to the wind.    And speaking of the wind, the book also predates by a few years the relocation of home field from Candlestick Park - termed by Bruce Jenkins as \\"the great wind machine\\" - to Pacific Bell Park in the heart of downtown San Francisco.  Candlestick Park was much maligned as a baseball field in its time, but it looks quite magnificent in the photographs that the authors include in the text.  And as they point out, it held up to the 1989 Series earthquake.  Fans and reporters who diss Candlestick today are weather wimps and ingrates.    The book is a retrospective of Giants history starting in 1885 from their magnificent beginning as the New York Gothams (\\"My big fellow!  My Giants!\\", owner Jim Mutrie is supposed to have triumphantly exclaimed, according to legend, after one particularly satisfying victory) to the glory days in the first 30 years of the 20th centuryunder Manager John McGraw, King Carl Hubbell, Bill Terry, and Mel Ott to the lean years of the 1940's when the war depleted their roster to rebirth and redemption in the 1950's - courtesy (in large part) of Leo Durocher, Bobby Thomson, and Willie Mays - even as economic considerations were moving both the Giants and their historical rivals, the Dodgers, inexorably away from New York and toward the West Coast.    The 1950's might have even been more glorious on the field if the Korean War hadn't exacted two years of military obligation from Willie Mays and if Monte Irvin hadn't broken his leg in a pre-season 1952 exhibition game.    The book also captures the empty glory of the Giants San Francisco history - a lot of great teams; a lot of great players; a lot of close calls and nothing left at the end of any season but a collapsed one-horse shay.  The authors perfectly summarize the history of the 1960's Giants with the observation, \\"It may be that no team has ever had so much talent and worked so hard and come away with so little to show for it\\".    Little did the authors know that, ten years after they wrote those words, they could be recycled to describe the Giants of the 1990's and 2000's.  The substantive questions that they ask at the end of the book about the team's future can now be answered, \\"No.\\"    The book's feature point is its collection of historical photographs, including, for example, a 1914 Cracker Jack card of Christy Mathewson, an art deco photographic cover of the 1933 World Series (Giants-Senators) program, and a 1952 program, on the cover of which Durocher reads to a cherubic Giant player the story of \\"The Little Miracle of Coogan's Bluff\\", and much much more.  Having this book is the next best thing to owning your own souvenir shop.    As for the writing, it is flawed in some instances and brilliant in others.  The description of the end of the 1962 World Series is so agonizingly good that I can't read it again.  On the other hand, the authorsseveral times commit the Giant mistake of saying that the team almost moved to Minnesota in 1976.  While the relocation of the Giants and Dodgers to Minneapolis and St. Paul had been considered in the 1950's, in 1976, Minnesota was (and still is) barely able to support the Twins, let alone a second major league team.  It was Toronto that the Giants almost moved to, having been tentatively sold to LaBatt's Brewery.  LaBatt's eventually bought the Blue Jays, who would bring two world championships to the city of Toronto.  It makes one think.    And while 1974-1985, as the authors say, was almost entirely a dismal chapter in the team's history, the one exception to that was the scrappy band of overachievers, led by Vida Blue, Jack Clark, Willie McCovey and Mike Ivie that made a serious run at a vastly more talented Dodger team in 1978.  If John \\"The Count\\" Montefusco (for accuracy's sake, his nickname contained one letter too many) could have replicated his 1975 and 1976 performances in 1978, the team could have pulled it off.  Failure to even mention the 1978 team is a glaring omission (there is one 1979 photograph of Jack Clark sliding home).    Failing to mention the 1982 team -- the one that contended into the final week of the season and ultimately took away (thanks largely to Joe Morgan) the satisfaction of playing \\"spoiler\\" to the Dodgers -- was also a glaring omission.    And - it's not the authors' fault - but while Will Clark's place in Giant history of the late 1980's must be acknowledged, referring to him as a possible future Hall of Famer now seems laughable in retrospect.  And his endorsement of the book on its back cover - \\"This is a must for all Giants fans, past and present\\" - turns out to be a bitterly ironical demerit.    Some of Slick Will's more cynical critics now wish that he had taken more of an interest in the Giants during the last season that he played for them.	2004-01-17

This book might be regarded as a perfect demonstration of just how ubiquitous male-bashing is.<br />The author is a rarity - a woman whose heart SEEMS to be in the right place.  SEEMS!  SEEMS!<br />She actually states that men aren't so bad, after all.  In fact, she seems to think that men, in their own way, are good and the welfare of men is a necessary precondition for the welfare of women.  This shouldn't be such a difficult concept, but for the most part, it's a VERY difficult concept for most women.<br />For that matter, the notion that men have needs that must be addressed is a very difficult concept for most men too - the ones that she interviews or quotes to this effect for the purpose of writing this book are exceptional in that respect.<br />Sometimes, someone will use an androgynous model of behavior to defend men and argue that men shouldn't be bashed because men and women are virtually identical.  But that's as much of an intellectual atrocity as is the original sin.<br />Dr. Schlessinger is adamant that men and women are very different and that each gender has its share of good and bad points, which need to be acknowledged and respected.<br />Moreover, Dr. Schlessinger has no hesitation in blaming the feminist movement for marital difficulties.  Sometimes, a male commentator or author will make the same point, but he'll make it hesitantly, self-consciously, and always with the hasty interjection that the feminist movement has done a lot of good too. (Like WHAT?)<br />But as far as I can see, Dr. Schlessinger doesn't even bother to make the obligatory obeisance to the monster.  Maybe, as a woman, she feels uniquely situated not to have to do so.<br />And she does castigate the married members of her gender, repeatedly and forcefully, about the emotional ploys that they use against men and about the double-standards that they invoke in dealing with their husbands (\\"if he makes demands on me, he's being controlling and abusive; if he objects to demands that I make on him, he's being controlling and abusive\\").<br />This perceived treachery will, no doubt, cause a lot of ire among women, but they needn't bother.  Men betray their own gender far more frequently than women betray theirs.  One truth-telling female is but a grain of dust tossed on the other side of the scale.<br />And Dr. Schlessinger even suggests that the traditional lifestyle of wage-earning husband/stay-at-home wife will normally work with less stress than the other alternatives (duck again, Dr. Laura).  She actually cites some sort of study that suggests that the traditional lifestyle is healthier for both men and women in terms of avoidance of stress and health malfunctions brought about by stress.<br />You hardly ever see such studies published or highlighted in the feminist-pandering press.  And it does restore some of my faith in divine justice to contemplate scores of snarling career women and prissy househusbands suffering heart failure.<br />But Dr. Schlessinger's effort is probably futile.  As wholesome as the main body of her message is, few men or women will respect it.  Male-bashing, androgyny, and the homosexualization of Western society are such firmly-entrenched social illnesses that they are perceived, in main, as NECESSARY - in the same way that an elderly man will say that his heartburn keeps him warm in the winter.<br />The deviates have such a firm grip on our judicial system and our culture that the entrenchment of gay marriage proceeds apace, in spite of widespread - but muted - popular opposition to it.  The fact that Dr. Laura herself was forced off the TV airwaves for expressing her viewpoint on homosexuality - based on traditional Judeo-Christian ethics, yet her critics were successful in portraying it as \\"hate speech\\" - shows who's routing whom in the culture war.<br />By contrast, male-bashing doesn't even DRAW any real opposition, and females of all generations are intoxicated with the power and pleasure that it brings.  So it's not likely to disappear anytime soon.<br />And is Dr. Schlessinger even the right messenger?  Does she even believe herself?  She might be a sympathetic victim of lavender character assassination, but her on-air personality is one of supercilious arrogance - you'd think that she herself never took the easy way out, considering the haughty way that she lectures others.<br />And for all her talk about the joys of domesticity and motherhood, she is principally identifiable as a psychologist, author, and talk-show hostess.  How much time did she actually spent raising her family?<br />Besides, she's a black-belt in karate, and athletically-inclined females have terminal penis-envy.  They are not bastions of pro-male sentiment.<br />Dr. Schlessinger stresses that female psychology is more complicated than male psychology, which is undoubtedly true.  But I'm uncomfortable with her repeated emphasis on how SIMPLE men and their needs are - it's interwoven into a largely pro-male text like fire-engine-red warning thread.<br />Does even Dr. Laura fully regard men as human beings?  Consider the TITLE of this book.  Does she think that her female readers are supporting husbands or house pets?<br />She might have provided the answer in one recent radio broadcast, where she expressed her belief in male simplicity with less elegance than she does in this book.  Scolding a female caller for giving herself too readily , Dr. Laura insisted, \\"MEN ARE DOGS!\\"	2004-01-04

But a \\"now\\" picture of the Safeway Shopping Center and Old Navy outlet that are on that corner now might have appeared too drab or too forlorn by comparison.<br />Otherwise, Yenne's color photographs of the present are quite beautiful, but equally impressive are the black-and-white photographs of the past taken by largely unknown photographers.  A remarkable amount of detail is preserved in those old grainy-black-and-whites.<br />Yenne gives us a few briefly-worded captions for the purpose of pointing out some specific similarity or difference between two or more photos in a given set, but as a good human camera should, he wisely refrains from any further comment.<br />Included in this essay is an \\"old\\" view (circa 1935) looking east from the top of Nob Hill between Sacramento and California Streets. The Russ Building, San Francisco's tallest skyscraper (31 stories or about 400 feet high) is visible in this shot, but also clearly visible is the San Francisco Bay, including the suspension cables on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, now in the middle of construction.<br />When Yenne shoots his contemporary photo from the sameangle, the Russ Building is now dwarfed by a number of newer structures, including the 853-foot Transamerica Pyramid and the 779-foot black granite Bank of America headquarters, and the bay is hardly visible at all.  Other skyscrapers have joined the collage, and now, incredibly enough, no portion of the Bay Bridge can be seen.<br />Moreover, in other old pictures facing the same direction, the waterfront is, as Yenne says, \\"alive with tugs, ferries, and other vessels\\".  But in contemporary photos, \\"the waterfront (is) now much quieter\\".<br />There are still, thank heavens, some fishing boats in Fisherman's Wharf in which commercial fisherman seek their catch with the same dogged patience that the DiMaggio family did almost 100 years ago.  Moreover, Alioto's, Fisherman's Grotto, and Tarantino's restaurants adjoin the wharf in both the black-and-white \\"then\\" and the color \\"now\\" photos.  But otherwise, the tugs, ferries and other vessels, sailing toward or away from the various piers have been largely replaced by pleasure craft.  Gentrification anyone?<br />The photos also tell a story of the disappearance of most of the cable car traffic that once traversed the City, and of course, everyone knows that the remaining cable car lines are kept only for the benefit of the tourists.  The City's haughtiness towards outsiders doesn't entail an aversion toward tourist dollars, after all.<br />But no self-respecting chablis-drinking San Franciscan would be caught dead in one of those contraptions today.  The late Herb Caen or whoever has since replaced Caen as the dean of Bay Area boorishness would laugh out of town any San Francisco native uncool enough to ride one of those things.<br />It's hard to imagine San Francisco's \\"in\\" crowd today enjoying anything as bourgeois and middle-American as an amusement park either, but Yenne is able to locate some old photos of a Coney Island-like amusement park called Playland-At-The-Beach that once adorned Fulton and Balboa Streets during a less pretentious San Francisco era.<br />Maybe time, population growth, economic growth, and recovery from two major earthquakes made some change inevitable.  But the old and new photographs largely tell a story of a city striving maniacally to grow faster than anyone else, often at the expense of much of the beauty and charm that it once possessed.  A city whose denizens claim to be unlike anywhere else ultimately aped New York City and other metropolitan areas in the frenzy of its development and in much of its resulting physical appearance. Does San Francisco's arrogant provincialism mask a latent inferiority complex?<br />Maybe the most illustrative set of \\"then and now\\" photos are the two views looking west from California and Kearney Streets.  In 1880, next to Old St. Mary's Cathedral on the north side of the street is a combination apartment complex/restaurant called the California House, and Yenne explains that it was one of the City's favorite eateries, noted for \\"fresh oysters in every style\\".<br />Old St. Mary's still rests on the north side of California Street in Yenne's contemporary color photograph, but upon the site of the California House now rests the 33-story Hartford Insurance Building.<br />St. Francis wept.	2003-12-31
US	50691488	R2FGGISSMHW27	1886483329	327827867	The Heartland's Heritage : An Illustrated History of Fresno County	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Get to know &quot;The Big O&quot;	Catherine Rehart's illustrated history of Fresno County covers the chronological gamut from the shifting of the subterranean plates, during several phases of the prehistoric era, that would form the state of California and its great Central Valley, to the city of Fresno's early beginnings as a gold-rush town serviced by the Central Pacific Railroad to Fresno's status today as a large city with a small-town \\"feel\\", still surrounded by farmland and driven by its agricultural base.<br />Rehart's treatment is an excellent one overall, though more noteworthy for its breadth than for its depth.  Fresno County is comprised of more than just its principal identically-named city, and indeed, it was Millerton and not the city of Fresno that initially served as the county seat.  Appreciative of this, Rehart provides her readers with overviews of the other cities and communities in the county.<br />To the transplanted Angeleno, nothing could be further removed from Los Angeles and the UCLA campus than the sleepy farming town of Kerman, 27 miles west of the \\"Big O\\" along Highway 180.  And yet, it's named after the two Los Angeles capitalists who initially bought the land upon which it is situated:  William Kerckhoff and Jacob Mansar.  That is the same William Kerckhoff whose name graces UCLA's Kerckhoff Hall.<br />It's a wonderful story that demonstrates the Central Valley communities interconnectedness with all points of California.  Indeed, one former Fresno mayor, W. Parker Lyon, retired to the Southern California community of Arcadia.<br />There are certain topics about which I would have liked to have seen more detail.  The famed Water Tower is probably Fresno's most well-known landmark and symbolic of how water helped Fresno grow from a small frontier town to the sixth largest city in California.<br />There are several pictures of The Tower in this volume, as well as mention of how it was used in the CBS miniseries \\"Fresno\\".  But I would have liked to have read a more in-depth treatment of The Tower, as well as some of the other architectural landmarks in the downtown area, especially the wonderful brick-inlay masterpieces designed by Felchin, Shaw, and Franklin, such as the Pacific Southwest Building, the T.W. Patterson Building, and the Maubridge Building.  These were all constructed during or after World War I, a period that marks the heyday of downtown Fresno.<br />Actually, I'm a little surprised by Rehart's glowing tribute to the City Hall building, which is an architectural monstrosity that clashes with the more sedate buildings in the downtown area that are a part of its history.<br />Moreover, Fresno's sports history is rich enough to have supplied a Fresno Athletic Hall of Fame since its inception in 1959.  It includes at least two entrants in Major League Baseball's Hall of Fame - Frank Chance (of Tinkers-to-Evers-to-Chance fame) and Tom Seaver.  Rehart briefly alludes to Chance and Seaver, as well as some other athletes but she does not delve deeply enough into Fresno's contributions to the world of sports - even neglecting to mention that Seaver's father Charles made the Fresno Hall of Fame as a golfer.<br />When the book was published in 2000, the downtown stadium on the corner of Tulare and Broadway had only just been conceived as a new home for the Pacific Coast League's Fresno Grizzlies and this is also faintly alluded to.  Interestingly enough, Rehart includes some photographs and a brief description of the old Hughes Hotel, a wonderful Victorian architectural structure that graced the same corner from 1887 to 1953 (before it tragically burned down), but she fails to mention that the new Grizzlie Stadium is situated in the same location as the old Hughes Hotel.<br />This is a shame, as I believe that her readers might find pleasing the concept of the Grizzlie's Todd Linden racing into the right-centerfield gap in pursuit of a fly ball, stepping through a time warp, and finding himself in a Victorian dining room.<br/>Still, Rehart's history is a fascinating one, and even the history of the corporate sponsors in the last section of the book is very readable.  And at a time when community leaders debate how to reinvigorate the downtown area, it is instructive to learn that the urban sprawl and over-development that caused the downtown area to decline have been issues for the last 40 years or so.<br />Rehart tells a story of how the purchase by outside developers of cheap land north of the downtown area helped cause the exodus of business from downtown.  But interestingly enough, she suggests that the major blow to downtown was the destruction in 1966 of the old Fresno courthouse with the Roman design and the famous cupola dome.  It was replaced by a visually unappealing generic-brand structure on a neighboring plot of land.<br />Destruction of the old courthouse was staunchly opposed by many Fresnan traditionalists and downtown interests, including the County Bar, but the county board of supervisors was able to accomplish it after the Fifth Appellate District ruled in the board's favor on appeal.<br />As sad and as morale-devastating as this must have been, it's questionable whether the exchange of one courthouse for another could have so ravaged a local economy.<br />My own sources tell me that the most devastating blow to downtown Fresno was the relocation of Gottschalk's Department Store to north Fresno from its historic location on Kern and Fulton.  But Rehart doesn't place a great deal of emphasis on this event.  Does that have anything to do with the fact that Gottschalk's is one of the corporate sponsors whose biography is included in the book's last section?	2003-12-26
US	50691488	R1ZKTYMGN096DR	0805069798	291359672	True Believers: The Tragic Inner Life of Sports Fans	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Queenan�s heart in the right place	\\"True Believers\\" is a fairly short book, but it took me a few weeks to get through it.  This is not a reflection on the quality of author Joe Queenan's writing but on the subject matter.<br />Sports itself, as Queenan insistently and correctly reminds us, is more than \\"just a game\\", contrary to what some anti-sports bluenoses think.  \\"How could you possibly compare the fate of the rain forest to the fate of the Philadelphia 76ers?\\" Queenan demands of his therapist.  \\"You need to get your priorities straight.\\"  And he means it too, and rightly so.<br />But while a proper treatment of the games themselves often requires volumes of material, sports FANDOM is a fairly lightweight topic scarcely worth the 200-plus pages of space that Queenan devotes to it.  I got through the book by treating it as a series of disjointed articles, rather than as a number of points comprising an overall theme.<br />And yet Queenan scores so many bulls-eyes through his observations about the art and practice of sports fandom that it's impossible for me to withhold praise for his effort.<br />Foremost among his welcome observations is that it's OK to hate.  You can't love a team or a specific athlete without being able to hate the object of your adoration.  It's OK to hate the team that you root for, and the players on that team, if you feel that they've betrayed you.  In fact, this hatred can be of the most extreme and virulent quality as long as it's never actualized.<br />Queenan deplores fan violence and in the same breath goes on to state, \\"But to deny that one has ever seriously contemplated killing the place kicker is to deny one's own humanity.  A fan who hasn't at least thought about killing the place kicker is really no fan at all.\\"<br />YES!  Thank you, Joe Queenan, for giving me the freedom to fantasize about committing mayhem on pig-headed and fastball-stubborn Felix Rodriguez and namby-pamby lisping doughboy Tim Worrell, the two San Francisco Giant relief pitchers who smugly and treacherously snatched defeat from the jaws of victory in the 2002 World Series, ROBBING the Giants and their fans of the first world championship in the team's West Coast history.<br />In fact, Rodriguez and Worrell would both repeat this perfidy in the 2003 Division Championship against the Florida Marlins.  Is there an entrance to hell gaping widely enough to admit them?<br />For that matter, one may properly allow one's passion for sports to interfere with his relationship with God, as well.  Queenan is frank in acknowledging that he has never forgiven God for allowing the Philadelphia Phillies to choke away the 1964 pennant.  Why should I forgive God for the 2002 World Series?  I watched it with my 77 year-old father, who will probably never have another chance to see the Giants win a world championship.<br />Queenan's point is that it is the very uniqueness of the skills possessed by the world's best athletes - far more distinctive than those possessed by other professionals - that give the games an epic quality that overshadows that which we call \\"real life\\".  He estimates that there about 5,000 athletes in the world that are the subject of intense scrutiny - think of how small this number is in comparison to the numbers of doctors, lawyers, teachers, and social workers who are doing the so-called important work.<br />After paying respect to family, money and career, Queenan ruefully observes, \\"But it's hard to relate to them viscerally.  No matter how hard you try, you're never going to find 65,000 complete strangers willing to stand in subzero temperatures cheering for your bank statement.&quot;<br />Small wonder that we venerate the athletes as gods and that they look down upon us as subjects.  In turn, it's equally small wonder that we curse them when they fail us.<br />Queenan also gives us an interesting chapter on the intensity of the British football fan.  And by the time I finished reading his piece on the Notre Dame mystique, a chapter entitled \\"Fans Who See Green\\", I wished that I had been born Irish and Catholic.<br />My main criticism of the book, other than its length, is that too much of it reads like an instructional manual.  Queenan devotes too much time to explaining how-to and how-NOT-to follow sports.  But he's too dogmatic.  Both the sports fan's paradise and the sports fan's purgatory have many mansions, and each fan must follow his own path.  It's rank Pharisaism for Queenan to insist that his is the only way.<br />But the release of a book on \\"True Believers\\", on fans who love too much regardless of how they are rewarded, was timed perfectly, in light of the recent failures of both the Boston Red Sox and the Chicago Cubs, baseball's perennial also-rans with ever-loyal fan bases, to make it to the World Series.  Both teams found a way to blow late-inning leads in the deciding games.<br />How many Red Sox fans; how many Cub fans, Viking fans, Saints fans, Falcons fans, Vancouver Canuck fans etc. will die of old age waiting for the prize that never comes?  How many have died already?  Queenan pays proper homage both to the fans who stick around for more punishment and to those who break the cycle of hope and letdown, as one would break a drug habit, by giving up on their team.  Chapter 9 of this book is entitled \\"Fans Who Walk Away\\".<br />And as I finish the book, I am still left wondering which direction I am going to take with the San Francisco Giants.	2003-12-22
US	50691488	R1ZOCW7TY6E1HD	0806518332	946644584	The Sixty Greatest Conspiracies of All Time: History's Biggest Mysteries, Coverups, and Cabals	Books	3	4	6	N	N	Vankin and Whalen are hot to plot!	Conspiracy theories are like medicine.  Taken properly, they can be a healthy antidote to unrelenting statism and the adoration of Big Brother.  Taken improperly, they are a recipe for groovy leftist nihilism.<br />Given the fact that the United States government, as well as other governments, have indeed shown themselves to have an unhealthy predilection for secret mischief-making, the conspiracy industry is something that should interest both Left and Right, and to some extent, it does.  But as is the case with so many things, the \\"mainstream\\" conservatives disdain interest in the cutting-edge and the controversial and as far as the \\"extremists\\" go, the voices of the Left simply outnumber and out-shriek the voices of the Right.<br />So most conspiracy authors have large left-handed axes to grind, and many of them produce entertaining but self-serving and un-edifying literary acid trips, such as Tom Miller's\\"Assassination Please\\" almanac and Shea and Wilson's \\"Illuminatus Trilogy\\".<br />Jonathan Vankin and John Whalen, the authors of \\"The Greatest 60 Conspiracies of All Time\\", are ... and a little more restrained, and hence slightly more informative and slightly less entertaining.<br />Some of what's published here is old stuff, such as the horrible experiments in eugenics that took place in the early 20th century or the CIA plotting against Fidel Castro.<br />The most entertaining conspiracy theories discussed are the apolitical ones.  The notion that aliens once crash-landed at Roswell, New Mexico is fun, and there really aren't any serious political implications to it (the authors treat it skeptically, in any event).<br />Also kind of fun at this late date is the notion of some sort of connection between Jack the Ripper and England's royal family.  But it's been done to death and has been largely disproven, as has been the \\"Lincoln Conspiracy\\" formulated by David Balsigier and Charles Sellier.<br />But as James Burnham once wrote about liberals and leftists, \\"Pas d'Ennemi a Gauche\\".  For them, there is no enemy to the left.  Whenever Vankin and Whalen are in doubt, they cast everything suspicious or dubious as \\"far-right\\" or \\"right-wing\\".  For leftists who only chat with each other, the Left simply doesn't exist for them any more than a fish might be aware that he's always swimming in water.<br />Vankin and Whalen TRY to be restrained in their conclusions, but for them, there is always at least the POSSIBILITY of an underground right-wing cabal behind every major event.  Just about every leftist conspiracy theorist disdains or ignores Lee Harvey Oswald's Marxist sympathies and distorts or ignores evidence linking him to the shooting of JFK.<br />But in another burst of creativity, Vankin and Whalen cast Mehmet Ali Agca's 1981 assassination attempt against Pope John Paul II as a fascist conspiracy instigated by a nationalistic Turkish group and they regard attempts to blame it on Soviet intelligence as a clumsy frame-up attempt by Western intelligence.<br />Mort Sahl once urged fellow conspiracy theorists to ask \\"cui bono? (who benefits?)\\" in order to come to appropriate conclusions about world events.  Vankin and Whalen have obviously decided that at a time of unrest in a Soviet satellite country, inspired by the Polish pope, an \\"ultra-nationalist\\" Turkish group desiring to spread \\"terror and chaos\\" stood to gain more from the pope's death than did the Soviets.<br />That sort of mindset reminds me of Tom Miller's pointed use of the small letter \\"c\\", every time he had occasion to use the word \\"Communist\\" or \\"Communism\\" in his almanac.  To remind us of what an insignificant role the Evil Empire played in world events.<br />Well, that sort of mindset is what probably accounts for the fact that the very real Soviet conspiracy to infiltrate high levels of the U.S. government in the post-war era through the use of spies such as Alger Hiss, Harry Dexter White, and the Rosenbergs somehow doesn't even make Vankin and Whalen's Top 60 conspiracy list.  Because, darn it all, there just isn't any enemy to the left.  There just isn't.<br />They even suggest that if Vince Foster was murdered, he was murdered not by people close to the Clintons but by people conspiring against the Clintons.  Oh, so THAT'S why the Clintons strained every nerve to make sure that no stone was left unturned in the investigation of his death.<br />It's a shame that the conspiracy industry is dominated by the acid heads and granola-eaters because I think there really is stuff out there that needs to be more thoroughly explored by credible authorities, stuff that really might necessitate the re-writing of history and the realignment of political factions.  This might include the eerie connection between the Bush family and the family of John Hinckley, would-be assassin of President Ronald Reagan, at the time that the elder Bush was next in line.  That's just plain weird.<br />And what if some sort of triangulation between Reagan, Bush I, and Clinton, involving drug deals and intersecting in Mena, Arkansas really could be found?  Wouldn't THAT turn American politics on its ear?  Wouldn't that just discolor the \\"red\\" and \\"blue\\" zones on the electoral map?  Wouldn't mainstream conservatives and liberals just have a cow though?  Wouldn't they just have a cow?  That's why neither National Review nor the New Republic are likely to look too closely at such a possibility.<br />But if our world really is ultimately governed by shadowy right-wing overlords, they seem to have left popular culture untouched.  Popular culture isn't a \\"right wing\\" conspiracy at all; it's more of a left-wing conformity.  Popular culture is shrill and cacophonous and it's dominated by leftists, nihilists, androgynes, and multi-culturalists.  The self-empowerment advocates.  The diversity industry.<br />Vankin and Whalen are a small part of this, of course, and they might want to ask themselves why the fascists allow them and their peers to operate so freely and so destructively.  Is it possible that the acid heads are pawns in a game played by forces that they suppose themselves to be in opposition to?	2003-12-06

And there's nothing like time to lend a different perspective.  He may have been too good to be true, but \\"Hulk Hogan\\" now represents the heyday of professional wrestling.  He symbolizes a period when the workers were tremendously entertaining cartoon characters who, at their best, mixed theatre, athleticism, and humor into a potpourri of fun and who, at their worst, degenerated into bathroom humor to please the lowest common denominator.<br />In other words, Hogan symbolizes a period BEFORE promoter Vince McMahon's introduction of what Hogan calls \\"T &amp; A wrestling\\" and what this reviewer calls \\"trailer-trash wrestling\\".  There's a scene in this book where Hogan's dying father urges him to rescue pro wrestling from this phenomenon.<br />This autobiography reads honestly and is a reminder that the line between what is \\"real\\" and what is a \\"work\\" in this unique medium is often blurred.  Just as Roddy Piper's autobiography betrayed the personality of a brash street-fighter,the narrator's personality really does come across like the carnie boss that was \\"Hulk Hogan\\".<br />He details the usual bumpy and painful road to success that is the byway of every worker in that crazy business, as well as his relationships with the others in the business, particularly McMahon.  Surprisingly, it turns out that their friendship and partnership is quite tenacious and wasn't seriously threatened by the \\"steroids trial\\" or even by the WCW-WWF ratings war, in which McMahon maliciously used an out-of-shape balding actor to parody Hogan as \\"The Huckster\\".<br />Hogan seems to \\"come clean\\" on the steroids issue, convincingly admitting that he abused them because everyone in the business did, and even convincingly admitting that he initially lied about this abuse because he took \\"Hulk Hogan\\" seriously as a role model and didn't want to give kids the wrong message about how to succeed.<br />I would have liked to have learned more about the other WWF talent from this era.  Hogan insists that he never abused his creative control and that it was Vince McMahon, and not Hogan, who wanted Hulk Hogan to remain undefeated for an indefinite time period - four years, as it would turn out.<br />Even so, Hogan should have bitten his tongue before complaining (as he does in this book) that Bill Goldberg's head grew too big for the WCW belt and that he refused to lose.  Uh, Terry, maybe Goldberg felt that he had as much right as anybody to become the next Hulk Hogan.  Maybe he wanted his own four-year run.<br />But Andre the Giant wasn't the only one who had to fall before the Almighty Leg Drop.  Hogan gives former MegaPower partner Randy \\"Macho Man\\" Savage a couple of brief mentions and gives Roddy Piper even shorter shrift.  But I always thought that \\"Mr. Wonderful\\" Paul Orndorff gave Hogan the best matches, including a spectacular Main Event cage match in January 1987, in which the two of them landed on the floor simultaneously.  \\"Bad guy\\" referee Danny Davis actually raised Orndorff's hand and gave him the belt while \\"good guy\\" ref Joey Marella raised Hogan's hand, and so the match ultimately continued - with predictable results.<br />Orndorff was such a great worker.  Would it have spoiled some vast eternal plan to allow him to have the gold around his waist for a few months longer than the five minutes that he actually had it?  Hogan barely mentions his fellow Tampan in this book and gives all too short mention of the many talented wrestlers who had to job in order to allow Hulkamania to \\"live forever\\".<br />But at this late date, I can more readily forgive Hogan for his goody-goody image when he relates the difficulties that he had in selling himself as a heel.  \\"Hulkamania\\" was procreated BEFORE Vince McMahon and the WWF when Hogan found it IMPOSSIBLE to sell himself to the AWA fans in Minnesota as a bad guy - they apparently regarded a bronzed sun god supposedly from Venice Beach, California as an object of veneration.<br />The book ends, appropriately enough, in March 2002 after a spectacular match against \\"The Rock\\" at the Toronto Skydome, in which, in accordance with what was planned, Hogan rescues his dying career and the stature of both wrestlers, winner and loser, is enhanced.<br />But it still ends all too soon.  The last time I checked, Vince McMahon's corporation was fined the grand sum of $2000 by the state of Maryland for the grotesque father-daughter wrestling match promoted by the corporation.<br />Trailer-trash wrestling has returned.  And the book ends before Hogan is able to confess that he wasn't able to fulfill the wish of his dying father by restoring a measure of wholesomeness to the profession.  In the end, Hulkamania did NOT live forever.  It fell before the three things it could never conquer:  time, Vince McMahon and the truism that no one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public.	2003-11-30

I was concerned about their equality and fair treatment and had very strong opinions as to their ability to compete with men on an equal footing in most settings.*<br />*I might have reacted unfavorably to this council of men and no women, but I was learning to have a new perspective about the differing roles of men and women...*<br />*With this new perspective, I had no reaction to the council being comprised solely of men.

US	50691488	R1PLBCF253IXMS	0785811885	203116984	Baseball Extra: A Newspaper History of the Glorious Game from Its Beginnings to the Present	Books	5	2	3	N	N	From the baselines to the headlines	This is the perfect book for a baseball fan (or a historian with an interest in baseball) to have if he's stranded on a deserted island.<br />I've looked at all the headlines in this book and skimmed some of the stories, but I still haven't read an appreciable portion of the book as a whole.<br />The detail is so great, and the print on the older newspapers is so small that one really would have to have the luxury of time to read the whole thing.<br />Essentially, the book is a collection of baseball-theme newspaper headlines from 1857 to 1999.  One can appreciate just how far back in time this book takes him when he sees a 1918 Boston Post headline that reads, *Red Sox Are Again World's Champions.*<br />The RED SOX?  Baseball's world champions?  AGAIN??????<br />Now THAT'S ancient history.<br />But this just isn't a baseball book, and those who can tolerate the baseball but whose historical interests lie elsewhere will take interest in the other slices of Americana that often lie side-by-side with the baseball stories.<br />The Red Sox story above is actually overshadowed by a headline about 13,000,000 additional draft registrants being called up, even as victory over the Kaiser is within reach.<br />Right next to the Milwaukee Daily News headline from October 14, 1908 declaring *Cubs Again Champions of the World* (another example of ancient history) is a political cartoon lampooning President Teddy Roosevelt.<br />The 1921 acquittal of the Chicago *Black Sox* players of conspiring to throw the 1919 World Series accompanies another story about the death of singer Enrico Caruso.<br />A 1948 headline in the Washington Afro American announcing forty-something Satchel Paige's belated call-up to the major leagues also includes an editorial criticizing Harry Truman's civil rights policies and announcing the assassination of a Haitian editor of a pro-government newspaper.<br />*Going away?* the ad in the lower left-hand corner asks.  *Be sure that the Afro goes with you.*<br />Ads for tobacco (*Rabbitt Maranville says, *Blackstone is the best smoke on the big league circuit*), chewing gum (*it's good and it's good for you,* the Wrigley's Spearmint Gum ad advises), and health-enhancing elixirs also predominate.<br />A 1951 story in the Kansas City Star about the boyish Mickey Mantle's standing as heir apparent to the great DiMaggio also proudly announces Satin School Jackets (regularly selling for $7.95) on sale for $4.98.  1951 model Dodges are available at Midwest Motors for only $1666.17.<br />Moon Mullins and other retro comic strip characters also dot these pages.  *Whadd'ya mean he's beginning to get to you?* an irate boxing manager demands of his fighter in the middle of an empty arena.  *He's been and gone!*  Now THAT'S another animated boxing manager who also isn't going to be saying *we* anytime soon.<br />There's even a measure of eeriness about some of these headlines.  Everyone knows that Joe DiMaggio's famous 56 game hitting strike took place in the pre-war environment that was the 1941 baseball season, so it's startling to see a number of San Francisco Chronicle headlines tracking his hitting streak - that are dated in 1933.<br />The answer, of course, is that years before DiMaggio electrified the nation with his 56-game streak, he was raising eyebrows on the West Coast with a 61-game streak for the Pacific Coast League's San Francisco Seals.  Incredibly, the Chronicle repeatedly gets his name wrong, spelling it as *De Maggio*.  The man was born on Fisherman's Wharf, after all.  He was a San Francisco native son.<br />And in another Twilight Zonish moment from 1920, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle proclaims that *Hank Gherrig* (whose bases-loaded homerun won the game for his local high-school) is the Babe Ruth of high school baseball.<br />The subject, of course, is Lou Gehrig who would set the all-time record for grand slam homeruns (it still stands today) and who would later join Babe Ruth in the Yankees lineup to make up what might still be the greatest homerun-hitting tandem of all time.<br />Yes, if you've got this collection with you, you have tremendous incentive to find a desert island to be stranded on.<br />Of course, the stories from the more recent years can be passed over.  And retro-baseball also contains some sobering food for thought:  50 years from now; 80-100 years from now; will baseball fans from the future pour over headlines about Darryl Strawberry, Frank Thomas, Alex Rodriguez, Garry Sheffield, and Will Clark - and modernist madness outside the world of baseball - with the same misty glow?	2003-09-14

So he cannot be here, mother, when the clubs begin to play?\\"<br />Baseball fans still feel the same way, so why has the umpire continued to endure to the present day?<br />Well, even an umpire is entitled to his say, and it was with great interest that I picked up this book written by Ken Kaiser, former major league umpire who lost his job in the famous putsch of 1999 when the umpire's union crashed and burned against an implacable war of management sentiment.<br />\\"In retrospect, this has to rank as one of the worst decisions made in the history of  labor negotiations,\\" Kaiser bemoans.  \\"They were telling me that the best way to keep my job was to resign.  Hey, made sense to me.  I'd like to say that I knew it was a bad idea and fought against it.  Oh, would I like to say that.  I can't.\\"<br />Kaiser acknowledges trusting union chief Richie Phillips too much, based on Phillips's track record, and Kaiser's honesty throughout this book is to be commended.  He insists that umpires cannot and do not favor certain teams or players, even subconsciously, because umpiring is an automatic process and it would take too much forethought to favor anyone.<br />I'm certain that he really believes this, but there are too many credible stories floating around about strike zones expanding for pitchers like Greg Maddux and shrinking for hitters like Ted Williams.  An umpire behind the plate during one of Hall of Famer Rogers Hornsby's at-bats once told fuming pitcher Jumbo Jim Elliott, \\"Whenever it's a strike, Mr. Hornsby will let you know about it.\\"<br />Kaiser admits that umpires make mistakes; he admits that umpires are human beings (that last point makes me hiccough, but I won't contest it).  He admits that no two umpires have the same strike zone; he admits that no home plate umpire can work a nine-inning game without missing some calls.<br />He's honest enough to admitthese things, but not perspicacious enough to see their ramifications.  An umpire can have all of the good will in the world, but one muff on his part can cost a deserving team a ballgame - or something more than just one ballgame.  Don Denkinger's famous blown call at first base in the 1985 World Series might have cost the Cardinals a world championship.<br />Kaiser acknowledges all of this and specifically alludes to the Denkinger call in this book, but his attitude is that the umpires are the most important aspect of the game anyway.  Though he has friendships with a number of individual players and managers, he regards them, as a group, with disdain,  In Kaiser`s opinion, a blown umpire's call that might rob an otherwise deserving team of a ballgame victory or championship is just one of the tributes that teams and their fans must pay to him and his colleagues.<br />He tells one hitter that he called out on a third strike, \\"I might have missed one, but you missed two.\\"  Uh, Ken; the hitter was entitled to THREE strikes, and if you missed a call, you robbed him of one of them.<br />His feelings are hurt that Roberto Alomar wasn't suspended from the 1996 League Championship playoffs for the high crime of spitting in the face of umpire John Hirschbeck.  Alomar was fined and suspended for five games at the beginning of the following season, which would seem to have served the interests of justice, but Kaiser would have sacrificed the Orioles' championship dreams on the altar of his wrath by suspending Alomar from the playoffs.<br />Yet, in the same breath, Kaiser professes to be shocked, shocked, shocked about umpire Tom Hallion's being suspended after a 1999 ballgame for bumping Colorado Rockies catcher Jeff Reed - the first time that an umpire had ever been suspended for this reason.  In the eternal war between combatant and umpire, only one party, in Kaiser's estimation, is allowed to initiate physical contact with the other.<br />It simply doesn't occur to Kaiser that it was probably just this sort of hubris that caused him and his colleagues to attempt to strengthen their job security by resigning from their jobs.  It was that attitude which accounted for the almost universal lack of sympathy displayed toward the umpires during the labor dispute.<br />Still, you have to love the game and be just a little bit crazy to become an umpire - the only participant in the game without any fans.  Umpires tend to be large men with attitudes, and Kaiser, who also describes his brief career as a professional wrestler, fits the stereotype perfectly.  Kaiser provides graphic descriptions of the hardships that must be endured by umpires in the minor leagues and indeed, had to be endured in the major leagues, before unionization.<br />Umpire school is literally like boot camp, and it might have substituted as a military career.  \\"When I graduated from high school in 1964, I had no precise plans for my future,\\" he explains.  \\"My long-range plan was lunch.  The only thing I knew about umpire school was that they didn't look at your SAT's.\\"<br />True to form, Kaiser also tells of an interesting childhood  in a working-class neighborhood that set him on the road to dark blue hell.  \\"I never looked for trouble, but when it showed up, I didn't walk away.\\"  His profession was clearly a matter of destiny.<br />Kaiser deserves credit for his physical and mental toughness and for his dedication to the game, but he leaves this fan unconvinced that umpires are even necessary for the game, let alone the most valuable participants in it.  All I know is that the honor system worked well enough on the playground.<br />\\"Let me mop the ground up, Mother, with his person, dearest do.

O'Rourke!  Hello, Ted Nugent!).  Never mind the impotent \\"compassionate conservatism\\" of the frat boy in the White House<br />Russell Kirk, who abandoned this earthly plane in 1994, was truly the last REAL conservative - the kind that sought refuge in prescription; the kind that refused to accommodate the sansculottic evil represented by the Left.  Armed with a tremendous intellect, he never let his focus stray far from his ancestral home and the body of knowledge accumulated over the eons by the generations who resided there and their contemporaries.<br />In \\"The Conservative Mind\\", he refers to human history as the constant unfolding of a grand Design, and he expresses conservative affection for \\"the proliferating variety and mystery of human existence\\".  This latter phrase hints at Kirk's interest in the supernatural, which is more fully developed in a number of his other books, including this one.<br />Today, political conservatism (at least, that portion that hasn't been subsumed by the party animals) is commonly associated with fundamentalist Christianity, and fundamentalist Christianity is derisive of spiritual visitations as deceptive phenomena of satanic origin.<br />But Kirk accepts ghosts as part of the same grand Design that encompasses human affairs, and the stories in this book involve encounters between the human and spirit realms in which great moral issues are decided.<br />Ash-Tree Press has reportedly limited this issue of \\"Off the Sand Road\\" to 500 copies, and the fact that the demand is so limited is a reflection of the coarsening of Western culture - a reality that Kirk expressed concern about as long ago as 1953, when \\"The Conservative Mind\\" was first published.<br />That trend has obviously not ameliorated, and the audience for this book is limited precisely because the tales in them wouldn't remind anyoneof \\"Freddie meets Jason\\".<br />Some of the stories in this volume are effectively morality plays in which Good and Evil confront one another across the Great Divide.  In others, an otherwise timid or flawed protagonist's encounter with the other world requires him to decide whether he will now steel himself to meet the challenge posed thereby.  Still others appear more like the artist's conception on the nature of things such as time, space, and eternity.<br />One problem with the concept of eternity, even in heaven, is boredom, but \\"Saviourgate\\" holds out the hope that the sober-minded among us can manufacture their own ever-pleasing conception of heaven without interfering with the Creator's Grand Design.<br />We also hear from Kirk on Divine Justice.  \\"Hereafter was everything,\\" observes the protagonist from *Lex Talionis*.  \\"Without that prospect, all life would have been a nasty joke and men like Butte the natural lords of life.  Yet the Lord is not mocked, and vengeance is His alone.\\"<br />Russell Kirk doesn't pretend to have all of the answers or to even suggest that an appreciable portion of them can be discovered on this plane.  In his afterward, he explains that his purpose is to unblock the keyhole so that the reader can get a partial glimpse of the mystery behind the closed door.<br />Both Kirk's afterward and editor John Pelan's introduction are better read after having finished reading the stories.  Pelan gives too much away in his otherwise excellent intro.<br />Kirk is one philosopher who can weave spiritual phenomena into a comprehensive discussion of the human condition without sounding like a 900-number charlatan or an ethereal nerd.<br />Far from being waiflike, he is capable of creating his share of earthy moments, and, in particular, \\"The Princess of All Lands\\" is, in places, salacious enough to compare with any Charlie's Angels episode.<br />Kirk is as solid as the towers of Kellie Castle, as solid as the foundation of his haunted ancestral home in Mecosta, Michigan - these being among the locales where he wrote some of the stories.<br />If spiritual phenomena play a significant role in his vision of the universe, it is not because his judgment has been overtaken by his imagination.  It is because his own personal experiences and testimony received from others give him confidence in its reality and in its importance, and Kirk does hint at having himself been a witness to such phenomena.<br />One need not necessarily accept Kirk's perception as accurate or give up one's own open-minded cynicism toward such matters to respect his viewpoint or to receive enjoyment and moral instruction from this collection.	2003-08-31

Indeed, Sherlockian fans have oft wished that Dr. Watson and his chronicler, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, had been more forthcoming with details about the adventures that Dr. Watson hinted at and teased his readers with.<br />In Conan Doyle's \\"The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire\\", Watson alludes to the story of giant rat of Sumatra as one for which the world is not yet prepared, and that might be the unpublished story that intrigues Sherlock's followers the most.  It might be the most oft-referred to of the unpublished tales.  In the Charlton Heston production (as both a play and a movie), \\"The Crucifer of Blood\\", Watson is, at the end, dissuaded from leaving Holmes when this case shows up at Sherlock's front door.<br />One way or another, rats have a way of showing up in Sherlock Holmes stories.  Inspector Lestrade's appearance is often described in rat-like terms.  In \\"The Boscombe Valley Mystery\\", Charles McCarthy's dying allusion to a rat holds the key to the riddle of his death.  In Adrian Conan Doyle's story of the Deptford Horror, Professor Wilson trains his dangerous Cuban spiders on the rats in his cellar.<br />But there's no rat like a Sumatra rat, and as far as I know, Alan Vanneman's novel is the first effort of all post-Conan Doyle Holmes pastiche authors to tell the story of the giant rat of Sumatra.  There may have been other efforts beforehand, but I am not familiar with them.<br />It's a tolerably decent effort, even if it borrows liberally from \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\\".  But this book is more noteworthy as a collage than as a novel.  It is enlivened by interesting characters such as the exotic and alluring Singaporean Widow Han, as well as the physically imposing and authoritative Captain MacDougall, a pure-blooded African sea captain who was once slave cargo on a ship similar to the one that he now commands.  And then, of course, there's Harat.<br />There are also some interesting depictions of 19th century Singapore, naturally including one in which Holmes and Watson come upon a snake crushing a rat in its coils.  And while I usually disdain romantic scenes, I was bemused to see that Dr. Watson's experience of women (in \\"Sign of the Four\\", he says that it extends over many nations and three continents) is further augmented throughout this novel.  There's a scene, in which a fruit called a \\"doorian\\" is used as an aphrodisiac, that will send many readers scrambling to their grocery stores - or to Singapore - to find one.<br />But a romantic affair between Sherlock Holmes and the Widow Han is wrong, wrong, wrong, even if Vanneman does not allow it to shake Holmes's masterful nature and devotion to reason - or maybe all the more wrong for that.  The authentic Sherlock has a passion for justice and a willingness to risk all for a damsel in distress, but is incapable of the softer emotions.  As Dr. Watson explains in \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\", love or physical passion in Sherlock Holmes would be as intrusive as \\"grit in a sensitive instrument or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses\\".<br />There's also a fair share of adventure on the high seas and on dry land in which our heroes sustain some very close calls.  Their physical skills are taxed to the utmost, and it's fortunate that the wound that Dr. Watson received in Afghanistan from a jezail bullet, that is a potentially disabling influence in the Conan Doyle stories, doesn't come into play in this novel and is not even alluded to.<br />But a Sherlock Holmes story is supposed to be an unwinding but taut skein of events with a dramatic resolution at the climax and an equally taut string of deductive reasoning at the denouement showing how the Great Man was able to arrive at The Solution in the service of justice and (usually) in the nick of time.<br />This novel is a confusing montage of fantasy and complicated international politics, in which the motives of both the villains and the authorities who dispatch Holmes and Watson to defeat the villains are still somewhat obscure at the end.  It simply doesn't hang together as well as does a traditional Conan Doyle piece.  Aw, rats!	2003-06-23
US	50691488	R1LOC280S2OIOB	0060087412	102151395	Screwball	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Kane Rose Up!	In attempting to write the Great American baseball novel, David Ferrell starts out with two strikes against him.<br />For one thing, he's a journalist - worse yet, a sports journalist. That means that he talks more and knows less about the world - especially the world of sports - than anyone else.<br />As if that weren't bad enough, he writes for the Los Angeles Times, the worst newspaper in the country. Actually, it's tied with about 1500 other newspapers for that honor.<br />And there are holes in this story. Some of them are fairly minor. I've only been a baseball fan for about 35 years or so, but I was under the impression that if first base is empty and a batter is hit by a pitch, the ball is dead and the runner on second base doesn't go to third. <br />David Ferrell sees other things that I haven't seen in my 35 years of following the game. He sees a professional sport dominated by career criminals and anti-social elements. He might be confusing baseball with boxing. Baseball does have its share of ne'er-do-wells, and if self-centeredness was a capital crime, the feds would have used the Organized Crime and Racketeering Act to shut down the game long ago. But it's hardly populated by prison inmates.<br />To be honest, his book is at least partially meant as a satire, and it may be that Ferrell meant to satirize the occasional baseball felon by creating a world filled with them. Ferrell himself may not be sure whether he meant to write a serious work or a dark comedy. The team in this novel, the Boston Red Sox, of course, is genuine baseball team, and the Sox's opponents are genuine baseball teams. The names of players on the Sox and their opponents are a mixture of fact and fiction.<br />But I doubt that we're supposed to take seriously a parent corporation known as \\"Amalgamated Ball Cocks, the world's largest producer of toilet valves, floats and rubberized accessories\\". <br />The premise in this book is simple: Despite several very close calls, the Boston Red Sox have not won a World Series in the memory of any living person and are widely regarded as a team cursed by destiny with the inability to ever win one. Giants fans can relate to this frustration very well, but then again so can Cubs fans, White Sox fans, Indians fans, etc.<br />In the book, the Red Sox have put together a team that, in spite of a complete absence of chemistry (the 1919 White Sox were a fraternal brotherhood, by comparison), has the chance to win the gold ring and end that curse - but a rash of serial murders connected with the team threatens to blow away their championship dreams.<br />This story is largely about a corrupt front office that seeks to obstruct and even mislead justice in order to win a baseball championship, but I found the notion interesting as a personal challenge, rather than as an attack on corporate malfeasance. The book made me look into my soul to find out how far I would go to bring the Giants a world championship if such a thing were possible on planet Earth and if I had such power. I was startled by what I found.<br />\\"Screwball\\" is an attack on a baseball world that doesn't really exist, in spite of the kudos given on the back cover by would-be renegades such as Jim Bouton. Ferrell imagines an ultra-competitive world of sports where winning is everything and subsumes all considerations, moral and otherwise.<br />But anyone who really believes this has never witnessed any of the numerous occasions where an overpriced superstar received considerably more playing time than a minimum-wage youngster with superior ability. Baseball history is also replete with occasions where management tried to force a successful player with an unorthodox style into conforming with a textbook form that didn't suit him.<br />And there was a time when major league owners, spending ungodly sums of money on \\"name\\" players, were insanely trying to appear penny-wise by reducing their rosters from 25 to 24 - often depriving themselves of talentedlow-cost substitutes who can often make a difference in a close pennant race.<br />Winning ISN'T necessarily a priority in baseball; it often takes a back seat to other factors such as egotism, corporate arrogance, budgetary constraints (real and contrived), and, of course, political correctness. Ferrell is wrong to distort and oversimplify the picture by suggesting otherwise.<br />He should know better because journalists like him, who never would have dared to physically confront John Rocker, an immensely talented pitcher, destroyed Rocker's career for a few intemperate and politically-incorrect public remarks of the nature that most people would chuckle at in private - and perhaps even echo.<br />The idea that a talented baseball player could be protected from accountability for serial murder - when his livelihood can be endangered for complaining about spiked hair on New York subways - is sheer whimsy.<br />But for all of its faults, \\"Screwball\\" is a very readable story, with a rip-roaring climax that will provide more than enough thrills for any baseball fan or crime novel aficionado.<br />And Ferrell also gets grand-slam credit for his creation of the awesome and surrealistic Ron Kane: a 110 mile-per hour fastball (!!!!) packed into six feet four inches of impervious and supremely masculine athleticism and ultra-charismatic menace: a combination of Richard III, The Major (from Stephen King's \\"The Long Walk\\"), and Sidd Finch.<br />I worship every foot of ground that Ron Kane walks on and pray that a merciful God will breathe life into David Ferrell's fictitious character and bring him to the Giants. I pray that a vengeful God will clone him, and put one in every neighborhood where a journalist resides. Where ANY pompous authority figure resides.<br />To borrow again from Stephen King - this time from \\"Cain Rose Up\\" - eat the world, Ron Kane! You gulp that sucker right down!	2003-06-06
US	50691488	R3FVOFLIZX0WP8	0930588827	65449070	Highway 99: A Literary Journey Through California's Great Central Valley	Books	3	18	19	N	N	Valley of the avenals	Highway 99 in California, as the maps in the front of this book show, covers a lot of ground.  It is, as Joan Didion describes in this volume, a highway in which the landscape never varies.<br />From Tehachapi to Tehama; from Lebec to Linden and beyond, one sees little mountain range, and what Didion refers to as the monochromatic flatness of the terrain through which the highway runs, to some (including some residents), symbolizes the monotony of life in the Central Valley.<br />You wouldn't expect it to be an inspiration for its own literary genre, and few of  the works in this volume, prepared by editor Stan Yogi as a California Council of the Humanities project, could be classified as great literature.  Two exceptions to that would be the contributions from Fresno native son, William Saroyan:  \\"The Summer of the Beautiful White Horse\\" and \\"Fresno\\", a story of how Fresno's economy rose and fell on one man's vision of making it the raisin capital of the country (it's noteworthy that this honor today belongs to neighboring Selma).<br />And there's a gritty working-class feel to some of the other stories in this collection that makes them worthwhile reading.<br />The collection contains a fairly even distribution of prose and poetry, and the poetry would probably be appreciated by someone a little more highbrow than myself, whose head spins when confronted with too much blank verse.<br />Most of the prose and poetry centers on  the hardships of those in the Valley who work the land.  It's often a very stark picture, and artists and government projects being what they are, it's no surprise that this collection would have its share of infantile leftist temper tantrums such as Luis Valdez's \\"Quinta Temporada\\" and Cherie Moraga's \\"Heroes and Saints\\".<br />And isn't Catherine Webster a caution?  Her poem \\"Child of Highway 99\\" seems intended as some sort of protest over the paving of Highway 99 but it comes out as a touchy-feely gush of female empathy, in which she mentions her own name twice.  \\"I hear in ten-thousand sweet rye heads rubbing a song that I Catherine am Holy/I'm the Kingdom of HEAVEN\\", she informs us, and I have no doubt that she believes it, though it is the land she purports to identify with that is attempting to crown itself with glory.  The poem is ostensibly intended as a glorification of the farmers who work the land.  But it does make one wonder how the loonies managed to steal the conservation movement from conservatives.<br />The most horrific description of life on the farm is a Depression-era piece from John Steinbeck called \\"The Harvest Gypsies\\".  Wilma Elizabeth McDaniel's \\"Picking Grapes 1937\\"about a \\"magic seventeen\\" girl working in \\"bursting sweet vineyards\\" and fantasizing about becoming Jean Harlow, following immediately after the Steinbeck piece provides a welcome upbeat contrast to it.  There are other contributions in this volume which demonstrate Yogi's attempt to balance a harsh portrayal of life in the valley with a dignity often possessed by those who work in it.<br />One of the other poems that registered with me was Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni's \\"Yuba City School\\" about a young Indian boy, persecuted at school by children and teachers alike, attempting to tunnel his way back to Punjab to \\"his grandfather's mango orchard, his grandmother's songs lighting on his head, the old words glowing like summer fireflies\\".<br />Art Coelho's \\"Papa's Naturalization\\", situated on a dairy farm in King's County, provides a more positive view of the immigrant experience.  Franz Weischenk's Jewish family finds refuge from Hitler's Germany amidst the honest toil in the city of Madera, and Alan Chong Lau's early 20th century Chinese village in Lodi turns out for a visit from Sun Yat Sen.  \\"Never having learnt the language I just have to go by hearsay,\\" Lau says, explaining his own inability to read an old Chinese newspaper clipping describing the visit, possibly intending to hint at a generation gap familiar enough to this reviewer, who himself has learned only a few words of Yiddish.<br />Thiphavanh Louangrath's attempt to capture her experience as a Laotian girl in contemporary Fresno (\\"Old Maid\\") seems rather pointless, and it's hard to see what benefit is derived by her decision to substitute one extreme mode of behavior for another.  Surely, it should have been possible for her to balance a normal social life with care for her grandmother.<br />If Yogi includes a variety of ethnic experiences in this volume, the employment experience is not so heterogeneous, centering mainly on life on the farm.  But James Houston and William Rintoul provide an interesting look at life on the oil rigs of southern Kern County and in the communities centered around those rigs.  Bill Barisch's offbeat social commentary, \\"Prison Valley\\", describes the city of Avenal`s attempt (and the attempt of other cities in the Valley) to use the prison situated locally as a cash-generating industry.  \\"Avenal\\", Barisch remarks at one point, \\"made Coalinga look like a cultural mecca\\".  Now THAT has to hurt. <br />All in all, a creditable collection - and perfect for reading on the Amtrak as the unbroken plane of the great valley whizzes by outside your window.	2003-05-28

But if it doesnt completely turn out the lights on feminist-speak in the workplace, it toggles with the switch.<br />His discussion of the issue of sexual harassment is especially worth mentioning.  Yes ladies; from the male standpoint, it REALLY is about sex.  Really.  Women do not have a male sex drive and cannot fathom the lengths that a man will go to just to do...it.  So they make up tall tales about men in power seeking to have sex with female subordinates in order to assert male authority.<br />So dominant is the female mindset on this topic that every benighted person knows that male sexual peccadilloes are really about power and not sex (dont even try to discuss the subject of rape with such people!).<br />But with the weary patience of Winston Smith insisting to OBrien that two plus two really do equal four, Browne didactically sifts through historical and statistical evidence to prove that men in power seek sex with women simply because they want sex (among other things, a mans sex drive is likely to be stimulated by power as is the willingness of women to have sex with him).  He supplements this discussion with examinations of the phenomena of the gay harasser and the female harasser.  And his timidity only goes so far since he even has the audacity to suggest that the male perspective be taken into account  when handling the issue.<br />However, the book is really about gender difference in workplace performance and compensation.  And  the full title of the book, Biology at Work:  Rethinking Sexual Equality, is slightly misnomered.  The book DOESNT rethink sexual equality, and thats a shame.  Homage is always hastily paid to the concept of sexual equality by both liberals and conservatives - even if the liberal definition of equality is of an eerie Orwellian deceptiveness.<br />Women, of course, have never fought for or believed in equality under the law, regardless of what flowery language theyve used to color their demands.  The womans movement constitutes a naked power grab, an employment of the false charge of male oppression as a means of instituting female oppression, which calls into question whether true equality really is feasible.  And this book has enough information in it to justify rethinking altogether the concept of mandated equality under the law, as have a few others before it, but this author, like the authors of those other books, is too timid in drawing his conclusions.<br />Still Browne assembles his facts well.  He repeats some of the familiar arguments about the differing lifestyles and choices made by men and women which would account for differences in compensation and achievement (women actually have MORE choices than men; are more likely to leave the workforce for domestic reasons; work fewer hours, etc.), but these arguments appear to be very well researched.  There is a footnote for every point that he seeks to make.<br />I guess that not all academic studies start with feminist conclusions and work backwards - just the ones published by the feminist-dominated mainstream media, which starts with the same conclusions.  Browne includes some of the other studies in his book.<br />Browne also tip-toes onto unexplored territory while denying any intent to go there.  Im talking about the doctrine of male superiority.  Its supposed to be very gauche for men to boast or even suggest that they are superior to women.  Its supposed to be rude, boorish, caveman-like, sexist etc. etc. for men to adopt the doctrine of gender superiority to their own advantage.<br />Exceptexcept that women believe themselves to be superior to men and have no qualms about saying so.  For that matter, a number of male quislings have the same belief.  As long ago as 1953, a male anthropologist named Ashley Montagu penned a charming little missive called The Natural Superiority of Women, and today other feminists from Helen Fisher to Robert McElvaine seem to have no hesitation in arguing that women should rule because theyre - uh - better than men.  With specific respect to employment issues, theres an article written by a female consultant floating around MSN home pages - without sources, footnotes or attributions; just the usual assurances about what experts say - which argues that women are better managers than men.<br />Maybe it should be possible to discuss gender issues without stepping into this cesspool, but women and their advocates turned the discussion into a dirty fight over genetic superiority long ago, so it really seems as though masculinists should have the same right.  And Kingsley Browne delves into areas of innate male advantage, such as mathematical reasoning and mechanical and spatial abilities as a means of explaining differences in the workplace.  The genetic basis for these factors is significant and the social influences far less prevalent than others would have you believe.<br />And heres a secret:  men really are more productive than women, which is presumably the bottom line in determining what is fair compensation.  Ill bet youve never read or heard of studies that show that men are more productive than women in piecemeal work, even though the detail and finely coordinated movements necessary for such work are supposed to work to female advantage.<br />And men performing academic work are more productive than their female counterparts, even when experience is controlled for - publishing far more often.  For most other professions, it is not as easy to measure productivity, but the implication is that, in those other professions, men might well be more productive than women in the workforce in intangible ways.<br />It must again be emphasized that Brown argues from the beginning that he does not contend that men are superior to women or that he would refuse women equality under the law.  But he should think it over; he really should.  Kingsley, theyd do it to you!led The Natural Superiority of Women, and today other feminists from Helen Fisher to Robert McElvaine seem to have no hesitation in arguing that women should rule because theyre - uh - better than men.

But Kaye makes the concept of ghosts more believable by delivering stories and analytical commentary that makes them seem to be potentially a normal part of any setting, like paint on the wall or noise in the background.<br />\\"Doorslammer\\" isn't exactly a chilling Halloween story, but by placing a door-slamming ghost in a setting as mundane as an office building, author Donald Wollheim \\"normalizes\\" the spirit dimension.  So does the dry humor of  Isaac Asimov and Frederick Pohl in \\"Legal Rites\\", a tale about a ghost bringing a lawsuit to enforce his right to haunt a house (but a refresher course on the common law and on the \\"full faith and credit\\" clause of the Constitution would have been in order for them).<br />This collection also includes the original hilarious Oscar Wilde classic \\"The Canterville Ghost\\" (horribly butchered by Columbia Pictures in 1986) about an old English phantom agitated by the arrival at his castle of a thoroughly modern American family too steeped in New World claptrap about commerce and democracy to display the traditionally proper amount of dread towards him.  \\"We really have everything in common with America nowadays,\\" Wilde remarks, at one point.  \\"Except, of course, language\\".<br />Of course, the collection also includes the obligatory chillers, such as the stark poem \\"A Suffolk Miracle\\", \\"Smee\\", \\"The Monk of Horror\\" and a Robert Louis Stevenson entry, \\"The Body Snatcher\\", as well as a bittersweet ghostly love story called \\"The Spectre Bride\\".<br />But while the thrillers entertain, it's still the more prosaic tales that make you think.  A ghost might be other than a disembodied spirit of someone that once lived in a human body.  In \\"Thurlow's Christmas Tale\\", John Kendrick Bang's \\"ghost\\" is actually his living protagonist's evil Doppleganger.  In \\"The Philosophy of Relative Existences\\", Frank Stockton suggests that ghosts might be images of the yet-unborn echoing from the FUTURE instead of the past.<br />My personal favorite is Fritz Lieber's very entertaining \\"Four Ghosts in Hamlet\\" about a troupe of Shakespearean actors, in which it is suggested that a \\"ghost\\" might be nothing more than a flash of divine artistic inspiration.  The more possibilities that are suggested by these tales, the more possible it seems that a ghost might actually represent a higher level of sensory perception, and the more \\"scientific\\" the inquiry into the supernatural appears.<br />The collection of stories is rounded off nicely by Marvin Kaye's non-fictitious description of his own inquiries, which description is finely balanced between interest and skepticism.  Kaye believes that he might have experienced supernatural visitations but acknowledges that it is impossible for him to be objective about exactly what he did come across.  \\"The price of mind is doubt, and it is a fair assessment,\\" Kaye states.  \\"I would rather be unsure than too easily deluded.\\"  He leaves his readers DYING - heh-heh - to know if he ever found his steak knife (but if he did, what exactly would that prove?).<br />An excellent read for those of us who don't really believe in ghosts but are in awe of them.	2003-05-08
US	50691488	R1ACD0B5SQIZXP	1885793006	177469539	A Trail of Corn	Books	3	13	20	N	Y	A crown of thorns?	There's so much wrong with this book.<br />It's way too long - 756 pages of text.  The author, Keith Walker, seems intent on sparing no detail, however insignificant, of Burton Abbott's trial in Alameda County for the 1955 slaying of Stephanie Bryant, whose corpse was found in an unmarked grave in Trinity County, and of the details surrounding the murder itself.  Some of the more important details of the case get lost in the mish-mosh that Walker concocts, and I lost track of many of the names, dates, and places long before I finished the book.<br />756 pages is a more appropriate length for an encyclopedia, instead of a true-life tale of forensics/ courtroom drama.  But Walker provides us with virtually no sources for any of the facts that he sets forth, and if he had, this presumably would have stretched the book out interminably further.<br />Without sources, we're forced to take the author's story at face value, and this is impossible in every instance because the author often \\"cheats\\" and sets forward as fact that which is clearly unknowable.  The most glaring example of this is that he often does take us into the mind of the accused, Burton Abbott.  The mind is that of an innocent man who is truly startled at all of the developments in the case against him, and because we see this early on in the book, a tone is set from there.  Yet one need not bemoan the absence of a bibliography or source index to KNOW that the author could not possibly know what was in the mind of the accused.<br />The absence of source materials and the \\"mind-reading\\" device could only be acceptable if the author had intended to write a work of fiction based on the true facts of the Abbott/Bryant matter, but, as reflected in the Library of Congress/ISBN catalog reference, he appears to be passing this off as a \\"true crime\\" non-fiction book.<br />The book also dwells overly loud and long on the travails of Elsie Abbott, the aggrieved mother of the wrongly-accused.  The slow tortuous routethat she travels while awaiting her son's vindication is obviously part of this story, but to behold it as frequently as Walker imposes it on us is just too painful.  Also, there is an air of unrealism about the way in which Elsie repeatedly shifts back and forth from maudlin grieving mother to whip-sharp Sherlockian detective with her own encyclopedic knowledge of the facts surrounding the case, and I suspect that Walker is using Elsie as a mouthpiece with which to describe his own impressions.<br />This raises the question of what exactly Walker's motivations are.  I do not recognize Golden Door Press, the publisher, or any of Walker's other works described in the beginning, but I suspect that Walker's intention, at least in part, was to write an anti-death penalty book.  There is an allusion to the anti-death penalty movement that was in existence in California in the 1950's.  And while none of the \\"bleeding heart\\" arguments against the death penalty have ever convinced me, this book does highlight the only sensible argument against capital punishment that has ever been raised:  the horrible possibility that it will cause a fatal and irreversible miscarriage of justice.<br />This book has caused me to revise my impression of another book on the same subject:  \\"Shallow Grave in Trinity County\\" by Harry Farrell, which reads like a brief for the prosecution and made me wonder exactly why the jury deliberated for as long as it did.  For all of its flaws, \\"A Trail of Corn\\" raises issues that remain inexplicably ignored or insufficiently addressed by \\"Shallow Grave\\", which was published later.  These include the issue of whether Burton Abbott's slight build and sickly physical condition would have enabled him to overpower a resisting victim and ascend a steep hillside.  Unless Stephanie was \\"walked\\" up the hillside while still alive, her murderer would have had to either carry or drag her corpse up the slope as well.<br />Some intriguing physical evidence that Stephanie was actually buried in Marin County before being unearthed and re-buried in Trinity (a notion pooh-poohed by Farrell and incompatible with the timetable justifying Burton`s guilt) is alluded to in this book.  The notion that the criminal justice system is often \\"rigged\\" to favor the prosecution, that prosecutors themselves distort or disdain exculpatory evidence in order to score a \\"win\\" (and the political plums that accompany that win), and that judges hold prosecutors and defense attorneys to dual standards of conduct is less incredible to this reviewer, in his new capacity of public defender, than it once might have been.<br />Notwithstanding the book's length, the ending does somewhat repay reading.  Elsie's (Walker's?) revelation of the candidate for alternative murder suspect is as plausible and startling in its denouement as the end of Perry Mason rerun.<br />Do the state of California and the county of Alameda have innocent blood on their hands?  Hey, Abbott!	2003-04-26
US	50691488	R303G8D6Y07211	B00008RUNW	920974396	With a Happy Eye But . . . : America and the World, 1997--2002	Books	2	19	66	N	N	George Will, conservafop	As an ardent reactionary, I used to be optimistic about the future of the conservative-liberal political wars.  My optimism was based on a Darwinian analysis.<br />I considered liberals in their natural state:  squeaky, bearded, granola-eating, ever-accommodating she-males and hairy, snarling, oppressive, leathery, liberated females.  I reasoned happily that conservatives would win because liberals would be incapable of reproducing, due to the absence of sexual differentiation.  They would not even have the opportunity to abort their young.<br />But now look at what's happening to conservatives - the same frightening trend toward androgyny that is occurring in larger society.  Conservatives have their own male-endangering dominatrices in the guises of Laura Ingraham, Kathleen Parker, Wendy McElroy, Peggy Noonan, Jessica Gavora and Suzanne Fields (to name just a few).  And the conservative roster of ineffectual males includes Sean Hannity...and George Will.<br />Will's brand of conservatism matches perfectly with his preening appearance and mannerisms and with the neutered condition that makes him popular as the unthreatening \\"house conservative\\" on the Sunday talk shows.  Really, he would not be out of place in 18th century clothing and a powdered wig.<br />Will has been around for a number of years so this volume entitled \\"With a Happy Eye\\" is just the latest addition to his substantial collection of wig powder.<br />He shares the proper and natural conservative distaste for Bill Clinton - dismissing him not as the country's worst president but as the worst man ever to become president.  Will's epitaph of Clinton might well match history's, but it's based solely on his aristocratic contempt for Clinton's vulgarity.<br />The episodes in this country's Clinton chapter caused a number of conservatives to invoke a number of manly and conservative values (duty, honor, principle) as a means of explaining their opposition to Clinton and Gore, but Will will have none of this.  He describes the core conservative virtue as \\"prudence, which means facing facts and understanding practicalities\\".<br />Disregarding the Burkean notion of society existing as a means of elevating its members, Will castigates conservatives who would \\"dissolve the people and elect another\\".  In other words,  the principal function of conservatives is to conserve existing evils introduced by liberals.  Elbert Hubbard was anticipating George Will when he described a conservative as someone too cowardly to fight and too fat to run.<br />Will is a baseball fan and that's another saving grace.  But he disdains the machismo of football as an example of two major flaws in American society:  violence and committee meetings.  Well, la-de-da.<br />And Will's horror of radical social innovation is selective.  He insists that the so-called \\"emancipation of women\\" - probably the most radical and unconservatively disruptive of all<BR>\\"reforms\\" - is one of the country's finest ongoing social achievements.<br />If a men's movement ever got off the ground - and, here and there, there sometimes appear signs of one burgeoning - would Will display equal enthusiasm for the emancipation of men?  Would he even acknowledge the existence of the Matriarchy?  Or would he yet again switch gears and suddenly remember once again that conservatives are supposed to OPPOSE radical social innovation?<br />Well, he capitulates utterly in his discussion of female athleticism (which he FAVORS), suggesting that the competitive spirit that it nurtures (which he thinks is a GOOD thing) is responsible for the rise in the numbers of female professionals (which he ALSO thinks is a GOOD thing).  Hence, the rampant discrimination against boys in the classroom and the unconservative war against boys taking place in larger society never enter into his consideration of why fewer of them, relative to girls, are achieving.<br />In the end, even Will's distaste for Clinton-like vulgarity is selective.  He beamsadmiringly on one youthful female field hockey player who waxes vulgar over her performance.<br />You might think that the aristocratic foppish conservative would summon a measure of reprobation against such unfeminine expletive, but Will blesses her for her competitive spirit and gently expresses the hope and expectation that womanhood will nurture this spirit while smoothing away her crudity.  If Will really thinks that females are ennobled and uplifted by competitiveness and emancipation and if he thinks that they are purged of vulgarity by the advent of womanhood, he obviously hasn't met any competitive and emancipated women.<br />George Will is one of several reasons why this reviewer, forever a reactionary at heart, has become disillusioned with that passes for conservatism today.  It's becoming more and more clear that if the emancipation of MEN from female hegemony is to be the country's foremost achievement of the 21st century, the conventional philosophies offered up by left and right will have to be discarded and that something else will have to take their places.	2003-04-26
US	50691488	R2NA1DW8J8MGGJ	0786411880	458527685	San Francisco Seals, 1946-1957: Interviews With 25 Former Baseballers	Books	4	19	19	N	Y	A championship San Francisco baseball team	A championship San Francisco baseball team.  Those words seem so incongruous.  They seem dumb and odd and made-up.  Like a self-effacing politician.  How can a professional baseball team from San Francisco win a championship?  How is that possible?<br />To ask that question is to see the world from a post-1957 perspective.  Before 1958, it was VERY possible.  The San Francisco Seals from the old Pacific Coast League (PCL) - a high-level Triple A league - won no fewer than ELEVEN - count `em, ELEVEN - championships - more than any other PCL team.<br />Granted that a championship under PCL rules was arrived at through more direct routes than the multi-tiered playoff system extant in major league baseball today, there were still ELEVEN occasions when the Seals beat everyone there was to beat!  Compare that with the record compiled by the team that has played in The City since 1958.  The Seals outdistance that team by a total of ELEVEN!  Jesus wept!<br />As the title indicates, this book is not so much a history of the Seals or a highlight of Seals glory as it is a retrospective of the Seals teams that the author, Brent Kelley, grew up with.  This includes a lot of lean years; 1946 through 1957 was not all gravy for the organization, and in fact, it was only by going public in 1954 that the team was able to survive at all.  Kelley provides a good overview on the story of the Little Corporation that saved the Seals - for four years.<br />Some information on the relationship that the Seals had with the major leagues is also provided.  During the time frame in question, they had working relationships with the Pittsburgh Pirates, the New York Yankees, the Boston Red Sox - and ironically enough, even with the National League team in New York.<br />Kelly also recapitulates Lefty O'Doul's stature as king of both San Francisco and Japan.  The Seals' post-war reconciliation tour to Japan, led by O'Doul, is still remembered on both sides of the Pacific Ocean and it was made at the urging of none other than General MacArthur himself.<br />The chapters are divided by the years in question, as Kelly interviews surviving players that he found from the teams that played during those years.  The interviews themselves are unremarkable and seem to uniformly contain the patterns that one would expect of interviews with retired PCL baseball players:  some players I stay in touch with; some I haven't seen in years; some are no longer with us; the money was nothing like the players are making today, but we worked harder and had more fun and I made more money on the Coast than I did (or would have) in the bigs and we didn't have to travel too far from home and we even had Mondays off and I'd do it again.<br />The uniformity doesn't matter; the names should live forever in the annals of West Coast baseball:  Frank Seward, Jeep Trower, Jack Brewer, Roy Nicely, Neill Sheridan, Joe Brovia, Bill Werle, Con Dempsey, Dario Lodigiani, Ed Cereghino, Bill Bradford, Rene Cheso, Nini Tornay, Jerry Zuvela, Jim Westlake, Ted Beard, Chuck Stevens, Bob DiPietro, Don Lenhardt, \\"Riverboat\\" Smith, Jack Spring, and Bert Thiel.  Young fans once pronounced these names with reverence.<br />Con Dempsey's story should be of particular interest because it removes some of the luster associated with the name of Branch Rickey.  Dempsey's contract was ultimately sold by the Seals to the Pittsburgh Pirates of the major leagues.  After he reported to the Pirates, Rickey, the innovative Hall of Fame executive who integrated the major leagues and invented the modern \\"farm\\" system for development of minor league players, ruined Dempsey's arm and his career by trying to force him to become an overhand pitcher, in spite of the success that Dempsey had attained by throwing sidearm and three-quarters.  Evidently, the corporate mentality is no less prevalent in baseball than elsewhere, even among the best executives.<br />Kelly also interviewed two players whose names that will be familiar tomajor league historians: Ferris Fain and Lou Burdette.  Both had successful major league careers.  I had not known that either of them had a resume that included a stint with the Seals.  A credible case is made for Burdette's deserving membership in Baseball's Hall of Fame.<br />And although they are not interviewed in this book, it is equally interesting to see that the Seals roster also included such familiar-sounding names as Frank Malzone, Ken Aspromonte, and Albie Pearson.<br />And fans of the baseball team that currently plays in San Francisco (the one with no championships) will be interested to read the interview with ex-Seals shortstop Leo Righetti, father of Dave Righetti, whose major league career includes a stint in San Francisco as both a relief pitcher and a pitching coach.  Befitting of an Italian surname, the Righetti family history in San Francisco baseball extends for two generations.<br />The Seals saga has a bittersweet ending.  After a number of years of futility, they win the 1957 PCL championship just before major league expansion from New York to San Francisco chases them out of The City.  Most San Franciscans were delighted with the arrival of major league baseball, as can be seen from the tremendous welcome that Willie Mays &amp; Company received when they arrived and from the intense interest displayed after the season started.<br />But there yet remained a strong minority of PCL fans who mourned the loss of their beloved Seals and regarded the invading strangers from New York as unworthy substitutes - especially the audacious presence of Willie Mays in Seals Stadium's centerfield threatening to appropriate the memory of the great Joe DiMaggio.  How provincial those fans must have seemed at the time -- but did they possess some sort of crystal ball that foretold how the usurpers from New York would bring giant heartaches, endless futility --- and no championships?	2003-02-15
US	50691488	R1HE46BYCN9OEV	1567311822	779647245	Sherlock Holmes in Orbit	Books	4	13	14	N	N	Sherlock Holmes and worlds divided	Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson have been in the public domain for some time, and since then the literary world seems to be divided between those who can duplicate the original Arthur Conan Doyle stories tolerably well and those who only THINK that they can do this.<br />The cover on this book is as fascinating as any individual story:  an eye-catching color scheme which includes a robotic Sherlock (the eyes are blank and the head is opened to reveal what appears to be a computer chip) superimposed against a background that includes a waterfall (presumably the infamous Reichenbach Falls) and a traditional 19th Century London scene of a horse-drawn carriage on cobblestones.<br />As one might guess from the title as well, the cover depicts the theme of the book:  some of the short stories in it are set, in accordance with tradition, in 19th century London, and some are set in the future.<br />Even some of the \\"traditional\\" stories have a futuristic twist to them.  For example, The Adventure of the Second Scarf involves an alien visitation to the year 1897 and a subsequent space flight.<br />I was prepared to hate all of the futuristic stories, but some of them are intriguing.  In \\"Two Roads, No Choices\\", two scientists from the year 2014 visit go back 102 years in time to visit Holmes and Watson in their lodgings on Baker Street in order to ascertain why the Titanic did NOT sink.<br />This story has got a warm familiar Rod Serling kind of feel to it, and it's very easy to forgive the author, Dean Wesley Smith, for overlooking (deliberately, I'm sure) the fact that by 1912, Conan Doyle's Holmes had long since left Baker Street and retired to his country home in Sussex to keep bees.<br />\\"The Case of the Purloined L'isitek\\" by Josepha Sherman is a cute futuristic story about a staid and dignified horsy race known as the Shrr'loks on the planet Kholmes ruled by a pony whose mannerisms resemble those of a certain fictitious earthly detective - just the sort of story that I wanted to hate but couldn't.<br />Some of the more traditional stories cleverly interweave actual historical personages or events from the Sherlockian era with genuine references from the Conan Doyle stories or with conclusions drawn by Sherlockians from those stories.<br />\\"The Adventure of the Russian Grave\\" by William Barton and Michael Capobianco involves an actual astronomical event that took place in the early 20th century, plausibly anticipated by Professor Moriarty's \\"Dynamics of an Asteroid\\".<br />\\"The Future Engine\\" by Byron Tetrick features the son of mathematician Charles Babbage, a genuine historical figure, whose creation of an analytical engine to perform mathematical calculations anticipate the development of the computer - the functions of which really do match Sherlock Holmes's description (from Conan Doyle's \\"Adventure of the Greek Interpreter\\") of the mental processes of his brother Mycroft.<br />There are also two stories in this volume which alternatively provide a lighter and darker side of Lewis Carroll.<br />And Frank M. Robinson`s \\"The Phantom of the Barbary Coast\\" sets Holmes and Watson in 1895 San Francisco (\\"The most evil city in the world, Watson; it would put Port Said to shame!\\").  There is a reference to Watson's having lived in this city before during a prior marriage that ended in tragedy.  This  is not directly derived from anything that Conan Doyle wrote, but I'm pretty sure that it is a tribute to Ronald Knox or some other Sherlockian cryptographer who concluded the existence of such a marriage based on his own reading between the lines of the Conan Doyle stories.<br />There are also stories in this volume not worth mentioning and others that are worth mentioning, if only to chastise the author.  The logic that provides the solution to \\"You See But Do Not Observe\\"  (a cat in the box is neither alive nor dead until one observes its condition) is unworthy of any adult consideration, let alone that of Sherlock Holmes or an advanced futuristic society.  Equally illogical is the solution to \\"The Adventure of the Pearly Gate\\".  Yet that last story, together with Janni Lee Simner's \\"Illusions\\" (an homage to Conan Doyle`s actual interest in the afterlife), describes a recurring theme that often occurs in collections such as this:  Sherlock Holmes can never die, can never be ALLOWED to die.<br />I wonder.  Although he still has a loyal following, it's hard to imagine that the man who could discern the trades of everyone on a third-class carriage on the Underground (as suggested by Conan Doyle's \\"A Study in Scarlet\\") by observing certain defining features would have the same success in an age where computers have eliminated much of the variety that once might have distinguished one professional from another.<br />Could the detective who used the distinguishing characteristics of a typewriter to unmask a scoundrel in Conan Doyle's \\"A Case of Identity\\" have the same success in an era where the word processor and laser printer have replaced the typewriter?  Could purloined documents (from \\"The Case of the Naval Treaty\\" and \\"The Case of the Second Stain\\") be recovered so readily when faxes, photocopiers, and email make them so readily reproducible?  And is a Sherlockian passion for justice permissible at a time when people are often quite willing to parse justice for base and self-serving motives?<br />Perhaps we keep Sherlock Holmes alive because we need him as a live object of respect.  And perhaps we need him for this purpose because deep inside, we know that we are dead.	2003-01-28

You'd think that the same reasoning would apply to communication networks. Liberals control the news media, the entertainment industry, academia and all sources of \\"respectable\\" public opinion, and this control trumps the occasional conservative political victories and endures through them, rendering them unavailing.  If liberals don't quite control Big Business, they've still hijacked it and give it directions.<br />Yet liberals aren't as eager to share control of communication networks as they are to have others share wealth.  Talk radio might be the only thing that liberals DON'T control so they have to try to destroy or belittle what they cannot replicate.  You wouldn't expect the only format in which silenced people can express themselves to always be pretty, and conservative talk radio isn't, so liberals like to mock the ugly ducklings that they themselves created.<br />Michael Weiner (aka \\"Michael Savage\\") is one of the ugly ducklings.  Anyone familiar with his talk show knows that  Savage is a primal scream against liberal dominion elsewhere, and this book, \\"The Savage Nation\\" is named after it.  You really have to admire this man's courage.  It must take a lot of guts for the most conservative talk show radio host in the country to live and work in the most leftist metropolis in the country, the San Francisco Bay Area.  When one thinks about how frequently compassionate liberal demonstrators erupt into organized violence, with the Orwellian motive of combatting \\"hate\\", and go unpunished for same, it is a wonder that Savage is still alive.  Truly.<br />Virtually everything he says is true.  You've got to cheer an angry man who says, \\"Women are afraid of angry men.  Particularly in this homosexualized, feminized America.  An angry man frightens a woman.  If a boyfriend can't be like a girlfriend (with the exception of a male appendage) she doesn't want him.  If a boyfriend can't be like a sister putting on nails with her, she's offended by him.\\"  Tell it, brother.<br />Or how about this one:  \\"We've got to go back to where America was still sane.  Ike and Mamie...a cocktail or two...no degeneracy other than in the closet.  That kind of thing.  You think I'm doing this for effect, don't you?  You're wrong.  I'd like to see the fifties come back.  A giant step in the right direction would be for society to reward, not vilify, the people who take a stand for decency.\\"  I too have always felt that on the day after December 31, 1959, the calendar should have reverted back to January 1, 1950 in order to enable that decade to renew endlessly, so that observation definitely struck home with me.<br />And in this book, Savage also makes war on open borders, multiculturalism, Islamic-sponsored terrorism, holes in American security and intelligence, illegal immigration, and the drug culture, and other evils.  Borders, language, and culture are the watchwords of his syndicated talk show and of his organization, the Paul Revere Society, and he maintains the focus here.<br />But while this man speaks the truth, unless he needed the money that the book should generate, it's not quite clear why he wrote it; there's no rhyme or reason to it.  It's \\"ugly\\", in the same way that his talk show is \\"ugly\\" - a very understandably motivated primal scream against the sins of liberalism of which a liberal establishment stifles honest discussion and prevents from being directly addressed.<br />Rush Limbaugh, who by comparison is soft-spoken, politically moderate, and not nearly as entertaining, still wrote two solid books which added some meat to the bones of his philosophy.<br />By contrast, this book says nothing that Savage hasn't already said in a week's worth of talk-show monologues or that he couldn't say in another week's worth.  The different themes assigned to each chapter are meaningless, as Savage engages in a book-long harangue against the same setof evils over and over.  But while stream-of-consciousness primal scream monologues often \\"work\\" on the radio, their effectiveness is limited on the printed page.<br />And Savage makes a typical populist conservative mistake.  He divides the American population into three groups:  Rats (liberal vermin), Eagles (patriotic Americans), and \\"sheeple\\" (the average uninformed non-committal American).  And he reasons that if the \\"sheeple\\" could only learn about their uniquely American heritage; if they could only learn the \\"truth\\", they would arise as one and join the Eagles in politically exterminating the Rats.<br />Well, pish-posh.  Savage is naïve in his failure to realize that the majority of people in this country had their values molded or at least affected by the sixties.  The sixties no longer appear in groovy and garish psychedelic colors; their sponsors have won the day by growing to an age where they have become the establishment and by insidiously making sixties values part of the plain background.<br />Conservatives should have learned by now that the \\"sheeple\\" aren't on their side.  They may hang an American flag in their windows in response to tragedy because that's patriotism made EASY and sometimes vote conservative out of  \\"motherhood and apple pie\\" sentiment, but they would never vote for a conservative who \\"meant it\\".  The \\"sheeple\\" are NOT about to turn on the Rats.  They rely upon the Eagles to protect their freedom and a measure of their earnings, but they rely upon the Rats to show them the fun that traditional morality (which is too HARD) would deprive them of.  And the \\"sheeple\\" have allowed the government to use entitlements as a means of buying off their better judgment.<br />It would mean changing his tone from a pep rally to a eulogy, but Savage's talk radio show and this follow-up book would make for more poignantly effective commentary if he were to recognize a fourth segment of the population that WOULD be Eagles but no longer regard America with love, realizing that the Rats won the culture war a long time ago and changed America into something hideous.	2003-01-26

Lionel Tiger is one of many people who pose no real threat to feminism but who wind up on the feminist \\"enemy's list\\" anyway.<br />In his 1969 book \\"Men in Groups\\", Tiger popularized the concept of \\"male bonding\\", and his studies of gender behavior in Israeli kibbutzim also raised some feminist ire.<br />In this more recent book, however, he notes the decline of males in terms of economics, reproduction, and morale and attributes it to the \\"pill\\".  His explanation is convoluted and riveted in the observation that the \\"pill\\" enables females to have complete control of reproduction.  Both partners are aware if the male is using a condom, but with the advent of the pill and intrauterine devices, only the female is aware of the likelihood of conception.<br />While one would expect these developments to have a significant impact on mating (if one naively assumes that the female partner ALWAYS has a zone of privacy large enough to keep such things secret), they hardly seem relevant to or adequate explanation for the near-complete disenfranchisement of males that Tiger alludes to, in virtually all industrial societies, even those with less advanced birth control methods.  This disenfranchisement includes male declines (relative to females) in employment, educational attainment, and real wages; disengagement from their offspring; and the prevalence of male-bashing.<br />Interestingly enough, while Tiger expresses some inward trouble with male-bashing, he has no hesitation in quoting male-bashing sources approvingly to support his points.  His bibliography is replete with articles titled with such endearing epithets as \\"Are Men Necessary?\\" and he expresses the wish that someone would republish Kate Millett's \\"Sexual Politics\\".<br />Tiger compares the women's revolution to the Marxist revolution and he goes off on the wrong track by deciding that the women's revolution is \\"different\\" somehow.  Communists rebel over the means of production; women rebel over the means of reproduction.  Tiger spends too much time sniffing bedroom sheets to allow it to occur to him that the causes of women making war on men in the name of feminism are the same as those that were behind the Communist revolution:  envy and treachery.<br />Because the fact is that Tiger is not an anti-feminist.  The ire that he raises among feminists stems from his occasional willingness to stray from the party line and to notice the real world behaving differently from the model suggested in feminist ant farms, as well as his willingness to consider human behavior in terms of evolutionary inheritance.  He occasionally asks some tough questions of the feminists, but he asks them as innocuously as a timid student approaching a bombastic professor.  This Tiger doesn't deliver the raw meat.  His questions all boil down to the same thing:  \\"What's to become of the males?\\"<br />And you get the idea that Tiger's mildly-expressed interest in saving the males is largely for preservationist reasons - the same reasons that might be advanced to save the spotted owl.  He has no real sense that men have value other than as curiosities, and he's careful NOT to urge that males be saved at the expense of the matriarchal status quo.<br />Males are actually not fully human in Tiger's eyes.  He has bought into the doctrine of the mutant Y chromosome and the oft-repeated notion that \\"basic\\" humanity is represented by the female structure.<br />And if he quietly bemoans what is going on today, he still wouldn`t change a thing.  He acknowledges that children are at increased risk in the presence of step-parents, but homosexual parents raising children (by nature, a step-parent arrangement) suits him fine.<br />The huge growth in the phenomenon of the single mother would appear to be a principal cause of isolating men from their offspring, but he spends much of this book singing paeans to single mothers.  The world is overpopulated, in Tiger's eyes, when he wishes to defend the decision of women topursue careers at the expense of childbirth and underpopulated when he wishes to praise the fertility of single mothers.  By the way, if homosexual parenting and single motherhood raise some moral hackles, Tiger doesn't care.  He has the soul of an intellectualoid, and he just CAN'T STAND moralizing.<br />The traditional system of men working for a family income and women wiving in exchange for support from that income SEEMED to work with less stress than imposed today, but Tiger certainly doesn't suggesting returning to it.  Because, you see, women are not only more human than men but have economic skills that men might not have and he wouldn`t dream of restricting them.<br />Why does he think this?  Well, as an anthropologist, he notices the acquisitive behavior of single mothers as well as networking abilities of women in the West African marketplace and is suitably impressed.  Yet the coiner of the concept of \\"male bonding\\" sternly calls for the breakup of male-only private clubs (whose existence would themselves suggest a male facility for networking, if he didn't choose to look at THESE networks through female-jaundiced glasses) because he finds them harmful to the legitimate career aspirations of women.<br />Couldn't women use their vaunted economic skills to form their own exclusive networks?  Of course, Tiger SHOULD be well aware that they do just that and that these networks, unlike the male ones, have the blessing of the law and of society.  It's the same old story:  male advantages are described in terms of \\"oppression\\"; female advantages are described in terms of innate ability.<br />Tiger's solutions at the end of the book are puerile and don't amount to anything other than \\"Can't we get along?\\"  He brings, not even a knife, but a sponge to the gunfight.  His response to the degradation of males and (he acknowledges the possibility) the literal phasing out of the male population is as depressing as are the conditions that he describes.  It all leads tothe depressing conclusion that before men are able to convince women of the fallacies behind the concept of male inferiority, they will first have to convince themselves.	2003-01-17
US	50691488	R2Q5BIQDNRAWP8	0761512802	913214577	The Stronger Sex: Understanding and Resolving the Eternal Power Struggles Between Men and Women	Books	2	12	17	N	N	Oh, do tell!	The funny thing is that this might have been a passable mens rights book, if it were not for the insulting title and the authors Orwellian games with language.<br />That women use manipulative abilities and emotional ploys to counteract a physical strength advantage possessed by men in order to garner concessions from them is no secret, and this book adds to the understanding of the evolutionary perspective.  That women, as a result, are less likely to withdraw from emotional confrontations with men than the other way around is also probably no real secret.  It ties in with the first point, and again the authors academic studies of the phenomenon add some understanding to it.<br />This is all very well and good, but instead of merely arguing that the male view of the balance of power between the sexes should be taken into consideration, the author phrases this female ability in terms of genetic superiority.<br />Feminazi junk science has been dehumanizing men for years by suggesting that longevity of females and vulnerability of males to certain birth defects is proof of female superiority or female strength (if longevity is an indicator of strength or superiority, is a tortoise who may live several hundreds of years therefore the highest form of life on earth?)<br />Driscoll runs on a slightly different track which leads to the same destination, and one anecdote that he uses is that of observing a group of rhesus monkeys amidst limited food rations.  The male monkeys are larger than the female monkeys and often more violent.  Well then, arent the males stronger?  <br />Apparently, it depends on whether you are using the conventional definition of the word or a nouveau definition chosen for the purpose of flattering female readers.<br />Because rather than the males as a group hogging the food for themselves, what happens is that the high status male rhesus monkeys elbow out the lower status males and share the food rations with the females in exchange for conjugal bliss.  Yeah, its a pattern that is often repeated in human society, but what a strange example to support the proposition that females are stronger.  <br />Driscoll certainly doesnt discuss the phenomenon from the standpoint of male altruism (or even the more values-neutral standpoint of male status-seeking) or female avarice, presumably because this would insult his female readers or his politically-correct peers at the academy.  So he argues that women are stronger because one may insult men without fear of reprisal.<br />Yet there are certainly male professionals who are adept at using emotional ploys, and one might as well argue that the con man who coaxes money from the one who earned it is stronger than his mark.  On the other hand, perhaps Driscoll would like to strengthen his case, to his own satisfaction, by arguing that the thief who steals money is stronger than his victim and that the woman who uses the court system to extract resources from men (either as tribute for a failed marriage or as compensation for some supposed employment wrong) is actually displaying superhuman strength.<br />Is it not more accurate to maintain, as Socrates might, judging from his Platonic dialogue with Ion, that the ability to coax or appropriate resources or concessions from others is a sort of knack?<br />Driscoll ignores the fact that there are areas of the world where women arent able to use their emotional means to inveigle favors from men with quite the same aplomb that they do in the chivalric West.  In such places, men are presumably immune to the power of female histrionics or they use their will to prevent those histrionics from coming into play.  And its hard to imagine any academic alluding to those examples from other parts of the world as proof of male strength.  When we hear of places like that, we always hear them described not in terms of male strength but in terms of male malfeasance.<br />Specifically, what we hear is that men oppress women.  But if the focus shifts from justice to ability, why isnt the ability of men to impose their will on women, either by asserting their authority or their physical stature, proof that men are the stronger sex?<br />It is a rule of thumb that male advantages over females are almost always expressed in terms of injustice or oppression and that female advantages over males are virtually always expressed in terms of inherent ability.  And Driscoll, who is purported to have written a male-friendly book, compounds these rhetorical crimes.  And Warren Farrell is well aware of such double-standards, having written critically about them in his own books.  Shame on him for blessing this one!<br />Women should open jars, move sofas, hit home runs into the San Francisco Bay and throw dead weight over their shoulders and climb down fire ladders with it with at least the same frequency that men do before being flattered with the appellation \\"stronger sex\\".	2003-01-16
US	50691488	RQX24S65M8SSD	0895261715	427240337	The Conservative Mind: From Burke to Eliot	Books	4	33	37	N	N	Once upon a time, there was something worth conserving�	An associate once said of Russell Kirk that he had the heart of a liberal which he kept in a jar on his desk.  Yet \\"The Conservative Mind\\" is not stodgy nor is Kirk's view of the human condition stagnant.  It is surprisingly both \\"liberal\\" and \\"conservative\\" in the traditional sense of the words.  Kirk seeks to reconcile the conservative values of respect for tradition, custom, order, hierarchy, as well as awe of the divine (though he includes the freethinker Santayana in his analysis) with the liberal values of innovation, growth, and reform.<br />Slow change is a means of conservation, Kirk explains.  A conservative is never so noble as when he acquiesces to unwanted change for the sake of general conciliation.  The great 18th century philosopher and statesman, Edmund Burke, is the locus of conservative philosophy, with whom Kirk opens his study and he repeatedly compares Burke's successors with the original lodestar.<br />And it is noteworthy that the hidebound Tory was a staunch supporter of self-determination for the peoples of India, Ireland, and North America.  This was not a break with conservatism; Burke simply felt that the same respect for liberty, as well as local tradition and custom, due British aristocracy was also due these peoples.  As Kirk says, \\"Burke was liberal because he was conservative\\".<br />And while American liberals like to claim the American Revolution as their own, Kirk shows that it was actually a conservative rebellion against royal hegemony, in accordance with precedents set by British nobles of earlier generations.<br />Burke and most of his successors largely distrust democracy.  Government by aristocracy is preferred, though the definition of an aristocrat is startlingly broad:  anyone who can command the vote of another besides his own.  It's confusing that any conservative would dignify the demagogue and the political boss with such a phrase.  Kirk's yearning for aristocratic government seems to anticipate the restoration of an Adams dynasty; what he would later receive would be the enthronement of the Kennedys.  Clearly, aristocracy is not always synonymous with conservative caretaking.<br />The post-Burke history of conservatism is largely a gloomy one.  In England, industrialization, technology, massive population movements, and increased literacy shake traditional landed aristocracies and old loyalties.  Popular attacks on property rights are fueled, as Marx attempts to incite radical discord.<br />Into the fray steps Benjamin Disraeli, whose conservative reforms alleviate material shortages and enlarge the franchise sufficient to stem the revolutionary tide while preserving as much as possible of old ties.  But time marches on, and the American Civil War, in particular, does irreparable damage to the state of the nation and to the Southern half that is its repository of tradition.  Kirk denounces slavery in ringing tones, acknowledging it to be a monstrous cause for the Confederacy to have based its own declaration of independence.<br />But Kirk is still at his clumsiest when discussing Southern conservatism.  He attempts to memorialize the eloquence of antebellum conservative, John Randolph, and the ice-cold zeal of his successor, John C. Calhoun on behalf of Southern independence, while distancing himself from their viewpoints on race.  In so doing, he fails to adequately address the hypocrisy inherent in Southern agitation for minority rights on a federalist scale, even as the agitators were engaged in denial of same on a local scale.<br />Still the Union victory produces a smug and interfering Puritan leadership class, as well as the era of the robber baron.  As conservatives, Kirk and his sources are vigilant in defense of property ; yet he finds the 19th century capitalists unwholesome.  The landed aristocrats that he admires, taking their wealth for granted, exercise it in a way beneficial to their rural communities.  The capitalists simply engage in unlimited acquisitiveness for its own sake without regard to consequences.  One can imagine how Kirk would regard today's CEO's and dot.com millionaires.<br />As the book draws to a close in 1953, Kirk perceives two dangers to conservatism in general and to society at large:  the expansion of the managerial state (borrowing from James Burnham) and a post-war era in which gratification of the physical senses without regard to moral context becomes the predominant ethic.  He sees bases for optimism that these trends will reverse, but unabashed pessimism would have proved more prophetic.<br />And Kirk, who lived until 1994 and never allowed a television set into his home, presumably came to realize this.  If in 1953, he regarded jazz on the radio and comic books in the drugstore as cheap demoralizing sensations, one can imagine how he would regard hip-hop and unexpurgated raunch displayed in TV and movies, and their attendant consequences on human conduct.<br />Few conservative candidates would dare attempt today, Adams-like, to affirm the moral nature of society, as Kirk urges; for that matter, few clerics attempt to do so, their theology having been annexed by this newer creed.  So much for Kirk's faith in American religious institutions.  The last politician to attempt to seriously discuss values was laughed out of office.  Today Republicans compete with Democrats for the MTV vote.<br />And the managerial state achieved its conquest with the advent of the Great Society, effectively declawing the conservative administrations which followed.  The last presidential election featured the nominally conservative and liberal candidates debating over just how much the social security Ponzi scheme should expand, whose national prescription drug plan was the most efficacious, and how much wealth the state should appropriate from its subjects.<br />Kirk seems to be as distrustful of counterrevolution as of revolution, and as a result, he fails to leave conservatives today with a blueprint on how to respond when the hammer has fallen and Sansculotte has fully taken over.  But he would regard today's world in much the same way he regards, in the first chapter, the living Irish orators in Burke's birthplace of Dublin proclaiming through amplifiers their success in increasing widows' pensions.  He would sadly shake his head and deliver the epitaph of the West, proclaiming, as Burke once did, \\"What shadows we are, and what shadows we pursue!\\"or its own sake without regard to consequences.

US	50691488	RJSOENH9ZY38Y	0425187217	984330206	In The Pit With Piper	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Roddy�s bagpipes generate much noise and some music.	Whether on the side of good or evil, Roderick Toombs's professional persona always had the reputation of saying exactly what was on his mind.<br />Roddy Piper's autobiography demonstrates that this persona was very much based on his real personality.  But to the extent that he intended this book as another \\"tell-all\\" about the business of professional wrestling, he only partly succeeds.<br />The book has three focal points.  One is the evil and exploitative nature of the wrestling promoters, including Vince McMahon.  Once you see that Bret \\"Hitman\\" Hart has written the forward to this book, you can guess that \\"Junior\\" is going to take a beating.  Piper compares wrestling promoters to houseflies, and it's not clear whom he prefers at his dinner table.<br />Another focal point is the \\"sickness\\" that drives wrestlers to push their bodies and their psyches past the limits of normal endurance just to stay on top in their professions.  It's a sickness that apparently is responsible for a mortality rate and a morbidity rate greatly in excess of the average profession or of the average entertainment field - or so Piper would have us believe.  He dedicates the book towards those wrestlers who died recently, and the list is a long one.  This actually ties in with the first point -  promoters incite and exploit that \\"sickness\\" in a way that makes one think of cockfighting.<br />And the third focal point that comes in very clearly is the bonding that takes place among the wrestling talent, though this is obviously not without conflict and ego clash.  Nevertheless, the reverence with which Piper often blesses his older colleagues as his fathers and his contemporaries as his frat brothers is moving.  The bonding is clearly all the more real and all the more poignant because of the unique risks associated with the profession and with the \\"sickness\\" that it is responsible for.<br />Still, this is Piper's chosen profession, and he admits that it beat playing his bagpipes for changeon a street corner.  It's an entertainment profession, and he doesn't talk enough about the entertainment.  He does talk about some of the famous events that he participated in, such as Wrestlemania I (McMahon and Hulk Hogan, the \\"good guy\\" and the winner, attended a publicity-saturated victory banquet; Piper and Paul Orndorff who worked just as hard in their roles as heel losers were abandoned and not even provided with transportation back to their hotel) and the famous \\"coconut\\" incident involving Jimmy Snuka (it was real!).<br />But what was it like to work with and feign intense hostility towards \\"enemies\\" who were his good friends in real life - Rick Rude, Ric Flair, and Adrian Adonis (Keith Franke), at whose funeral Piper delivered the eulogy?<br />What happened on the set when that first WWF album was cut - the one in which Piper's tirade breaks up the wrestlers' version of \\"Land of a Thousand Dances\\" and in which he sings an insane solo called \\"For Everybody\\"?<br />What was the story behind the creation of \\"Monday Night RAW\\" and the WWF/WCW Raw/Nitro ratings battles?  Behind the creation of the New World Order (NWO), which caused Hulk Hogan to turn heel (!!!) and which led to a rematch of the Piper/Hogan wars from the 1980's with the \\"good guy\\"/\\"bad guy\\" roles reversed?<br />And, most of all, with his big mouth and his brashness and his bratty mannerisms, Piper was born to be a heel.  So why did he waste almost the last fifteen years of his career as a babyface?  Roddy Piper as a \\"good guy\\" was about as convincing as Michael Dukakis in an army tank.<br />It's not even clear from this book how much is \\"real\\" and how much is \\"fake\\" in the industry.  The outcome of a match is determined in advance, Roddy tells us, but the blows that are delivered in the match and some of the shots delivered in the promos (such as the attack on Snuka) are real.<br />Yet, the mutual contempt between Piper and Mr. T, before the boxing match at Wrestlemania II, was real and there was apparently no predetermined outcome - the other wrestlers bet on the result.  And yet Piper also claims to have pulled his punches.  Was this truly a \\"shoot\\", and are \\"shoots\\" commonplace?  I have a hard time believing that he intentionally took an honest-to-God piledriver onto a solid surface from the Undertaker without losing his life or the ability to move below his neck.<br />Piper is too busy giving us the lowdown on the \\"dark\\" side of the profession to talk about the fun side.<br />And for a streetwise guy, he's remarkably naïve.  Having been willing, by his own admission, to do almost anything to anybody in order to promote himself, does he realize how silly it sounds for him to say that he objected to a particular staged segment of \\"Piper's Pit\\" as being offensive to his sensibilities as a Christian?<br />He's also naïve about the world outside his own.  For all of the unique risks and sacrifices undergone by professional wrestlers, they are not EXTREMELY different from those undergone by others, even in (maybe ESPECIALLY in) the white and blue-collar worlds that Piper has never seen.   The corporate CEOs, the corner-cutting entrepreneurs, and the pink-collar dominatrices that run so much of our lives are no less pernicious than the wrestling promoters that Piper swats.<br />And for every wrestler who died or suffered disability from a dangerous stunt or an overdose of painkillers in a frantic attempt to feed his family, there are thousands of workers with families who died or suffered disabilities from industrial accidents, coronaries, ulcers, and their own form of substance abuse - many of whom paid money to watch Piper perform.<br />Having drawn heat from the fans for over a quarter century, Piper spends too much time now asking for our sympathy  - and not enough time applauding us for a change.	2003-01-12
US	50691488	R3IQF127Z55FZN	0792451074	612270784	The Lost Adventures of Sherlock Holmes: Based on the Original Radio Plays by Dennis Green and Anthony Boucher	Books	5	7	7	N	N	"It shall always be Sherlock Holmes and Victorian England"	This is a very enjoyable collection of stories based on scripts from the original radio plays.<br />Basil Rathbone was a \\"softer\\" version of Holmes.  The original Sherlock could be hard and unfeeling - a machine as Watson often describes him.<br />That probably didn't play to audiences so, by comparison, Rathbone is just mildly eccentric.  He's far more tolerant of the inability of Watson and others to keep up with him than is the original Sherlock.<br />It's a little as if someone had found the dichotomy betwen Hamlet's magnificent spirit and his fatal flaw disconcerting and had rewritten Shakespeare's classic to make Hamlet just a typical troubled young adult struggling with newfound freedom and responsibilties.<br />And Nigel Bruce's bumbling Watson is largely comic relief and equally unlike the original Conan Doyle version.<br />But at least the original radio playwrights kept the two heroes in late 19th century/early 20th century England.  I think that most of the movies that Rathbone and Bruce made were set during World War II.  I mean, no one could be a worthier contender against the Nazis than Sherlock Holmes, but still...<br />The story of how Holmes and Watson first meet Moriarty is unconvincing, as is the portrayal of Moriarty, and equally unconvincing is how, in \\"The April Fool's Adventure\\", Holmes finds all of the clues that the pranksters leave for him to find but doesn't see how they were intended to point to himself as the culprit.  His inability to recognize himself is bewildering, and he must have forgotten to use his magnifying glass to look at the calendar.<br />But so what?  When a classic is changed for mass market effect, the result is often disastrous, but not so here.<br />The bottom line is that all of the stories are very enjoyable.  For all of the merit of the original Conan Doyle classics, they were written as a disagreeable chore to satisfy the public's demand for a character that Conan Doyle himself had quickly grown tired of.<br />These stories were crafted with a lot of love and care, and that might be why the two main characters themselves draw more affection than do the original versions.<br />Our debt to Conan Doyle for bringing us Sherlock Holmes is incalculable, but equally incalculable is our debt to his contemporaries for forcing the author to resurrect the great detective from (what we were led to believe was) the bottom of Reichenbach Falls.  Perhaps the public also deserves credit for rescuing Holmes's humanity as well as his life from the clutches of his original creator, and perhaps this kinder, gentler Holmes is an example of this second rescue effort.<br />And speaking of Holmes's life, the last story in this collection provides a plausible explanation (entirely consistent with the Conan Doyle concordance) of why Sherlock Holmes cannot die.  Literally.  That's worth the price of admission, in and of itself.	2003-01-01

So there are no sensational revelations here.<br />But this is a good snapshot of the era in which Willie played, as he experienced it at the time.<br />A very lyrical phrase which begins \\"I remember the clouds\\" opens the first chapter of this book which takes place in the 9th inning of the New York Giants' deciding 1951 playoff game against the Brooklyn Dodgers.<br />In this inning, responding to a heartfelt plea from manager Leo Durocher, the Giants would cap a season marked by a miraculous comeback from 13 1/2 games out and stage an incredible 4-run rally in the bottom of the 9th inning to steal the pennant from Brooklyn - capped off, of course, by Bobby Thomson's famous 3-run homer, hit while Willie, a 20 year old rookie in 1951, was nervously waiting his turn in the on-deck circle.<br />When the book shifts to the last game of the 1962 playoffs between the Giants and Dodgers (both since transplanted to the West Coast), Willie or Einstein or both cleverly start that chapter with the same lyrical phrase that begins with, \\"I remember the clouds...\\"<br />The Giants, of course, are about to repeat history by staging another last-ditch comeback to win, though it will be with less melodrama than that which took place in 1951, and in view of this, the authors recite where some of the participants from 1951 are on this occasion in 1962.<br />\\"Durocher?\\" Willie asks rhetorically.  \\"He was in the Dodger dugout as a coach.  But I knew he remembered.  I knew he remembered.\\"  Yes, one expects that Durocher must have remembered; must have awaited the start of the 9th inning with trepidation; and must have been the least surprised man on the field or in the dugout at the outcome.<br />On this occasion, of course, Willie is not a mere spectator, but on this occasion, eleven years later, he's no longer a nervous rookie but an established star who wants to be up there with the game on the line, and his single off of Ed Roebuck's leg fanned the flames of the rally.<br />For the most part, it's over the head of the Giants organization that the clouds have hung, but one must be grateful to Mays and Einstein for portraying - and in such poetic fashion - two occasions where the clouds hung over the heads of their opponents instead.<br />Say Hey!	2003-01-01

However, \\"Runs, Hits and an Era\\" is a little more fortified with statistics.  The names of Jigger Statz and Buzz Arlett are hardly household words today, but they truly must have been the Henry Aaron and Barry Bonds of their league and era.<br />And the authors rely less on interviews with the participants and more on traditional written sources - newspaper articles and other books written on the subject.  In this book, there is perhaps slightly more emphasis on the Pacific Coast League's relationship to the other professional baseball leagues, major and minor, and on its relationship to the world at large.<br />This book has the usual collection of wonderful baseball photos from that era but also some photographs from the historical period in general.  On page 3, there's a photograph from 1869 of the meeting of the rails of the Transcontinental Railroad that joined the eastern and western parts of the country.  This enabled professional eastern teams to compete on the West Coast.  The barnstorming tour of the first Cincinnati Reds baseball team took them to the West Coast, and while they bowled over the local teams with the same regularity that they bowled over everyone else during their incredible 130 game win streak, their visit did help set into motion the forces that would promote professional baseball on the West Coast.<br />Zingg and Medeiros also provide more information on the \\"color line\\", which was practiced by the PCL as unjustly and almost as rigidly as that practiced by the majors.  Its existence was also just as predictably doomed, as the influx of  \\"colored\\" talent would prove to be too overwhelming to be denied.  Names such as Luke Easter, Minnie Minoso, and Artie Wilson might be familiar to many, but I was surprised to see the name of Piper Davis alongside these others.<br />A mainstay of the old Negro Leagues that played in the shadows of the white major league teams in the east, Piper Davis is largely known for having first signed Willie Mays to a Birmingham Black Baron contract in the 1940`s.  I had not known that he made his way to the Pacific Coast afterwards and established himself as a PCL pioneer.<br />Who hit the longest home run in the history of professional baseball in the San Francisco Bay Area?  The first five names that likely came to your mind were Barry Bonds, Mark McGwire, Jose Canseco, Reggie Jackson and Willie McCovey.  The name Roy Carlyle of the Oakland Oaks probably wouldn't have ranked high on your list, but with the immortal Buzz Arlett waiting his turn on-deck, Carlyle's 618-foot Fourth of July blast in 1929 off of the San Francisco Missions' Ernie Nevers (yes, the old football star) probably traveled farther than any \\"splash down\\".  Carlyle looks like an ordinary-sized chap in his picture, and presumably, he accomplished this without the assistance of andro.<br />The description of radio recreations of PCL games sounds a little too familiar:  if the telegraph or telephone became temporarily inoperative, the \\"recreater\\" would have to have the hitter foul off pitches endlessly until the problem was fixed.  That sounds a lot like the legend of how \\"Dutch\\" Reagan prolonged Billy Jurges's trip to home plate for a half hour.  Did these things really happen or are the stories apocryphal?  A delay in transmission sounds more like an excuse for giving the advertisers their money's worth than for a succession of foul balls.<br />Interestingly enough, these authors seem to disagree with Dobbins on the attitude of the major leagues toward PCL absorption.  The PCL made a strong bid for major league membership after World War II, and Dobbins seems to feel that the major league owners thwarted this with an intent of possibly themselves relocating or expanding to the Pacific Coast some day.  But Zingg and Medeiros argue that skepticism about the West Coast as a major league locale and about the adequacy of the PCL ballparks was genuine and that relocation to the West Coast really was initially regarded as prohibitively expensive, noting that the marginal teams that did relocate first chose locations in the Midwest such as Milwaukee and Kansas City.<br />Notwithstanding the title, this book has a brief recapitulation of the league's post-1958 history.  It yet exists today as a wholly-controlled minor league adjunct to the majors and even has expanded INTO the Pacific Ocean by adding a team in Hawaii.  Even Little Rock has a team - Little Rock, Alaska, that is.  But it seems universally agreed that when the Giants and the Dodgers arrived in San Francisco and Los Angeles, respectively, in 1958, this was the end of the PCL as traditionally conceived, as the original franchises moved and changed their names.<br />Still, books like this whet the reader's appetite for more.  Surely it isn't too late to ship the Dodgers back to Brooklyn, the Giants to a city like Montreal that might deserve a perennial non-champion, the A's back to Philly or Kansas City, and the other major league West Coast expansion upstarts to oblivion.  When the shopping center on 16th and Bryant in San Francisco is torn down to rebuild Seals Stadium and when the studio on Beverly and Fairfax is torn down to rebuild Gilmore Field and when the community center on 42nd and Avalon is torn down to rebuild Wrigley Field and when Oaks Park is rebuilt even alongside the plaque in Emeryville that STILL commemorates the Roy Carlyle blast, the Pacific Coast League can be reborn, and West Coast baseball can awake from its prolonged slumber and begin again in earnest.	2002-12-25
US	50691488	R25RANDZ0GJV3S	0786706988	829168256	The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes	Books	3	14	17	N	N	Interesting combination of schlock and home cooking	Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's acquired disdain for his own renowned detective creation is legendary, and `tis said that when William Gillette wired him with the question, \\"May I marry Holmes?\\" (to a female character), Conan Doyle brusquely replied, \\"You may marry him or murder him or do what you like with him.\\"<br />But one must draw the line somewhere.  And notwithstanding Mollie Hardwick's excellent paean to the legend of Sherlock Holmes at the head of this collection of short stories, I wonder whether even Conan Doyle could have stomached some of these literary assaults upon it.<br />In  \\"Sherlock Holmes and the Muffin\\", Dorothy Hughes presents us with a feminist Holmes and Watson who look forward to the day when women become doctors and scientists.  Another swig of Women 100 Proof and Ms. Hughes would have had them lobbying from their 19th century perches for abortion on demand, free daycare, and a chocolate bar in the glove compartment of every SUV, a bottle of prozac in the pocket of every power suit.<br />And even THIS atrocity barely holds its own, as an atrocity, against the contemporary setting of Joyce Harrington's \\"The Adventure of the Gowanus Abduction\\", in which a delicate hippie-type Watson plays second fiddle to a ferocious liberated female Holmes - not only as \\"her\\" assistant but as \\"her \\" lover.  Indeed, the story winds up with a broad hint of a rendezvous in the bedroom, but I think that this Watson will couple with this Holmes about as successfully as Tchaikovsky did with Antonina Milyukova.<br />This book also has its share of short stories that do considerably more justice to the Sherlockian tradition, and the best of these are Barry Jones's \\"The Shadows on the Lawn\\", Edward D. Hoch's \\"The Return of the Speckled Band\\", and Stuart Kaminsky's \\"The Final Toast\\".  The Jones story, in particular, is very chilling.<br />But John Lutz's \\"The Infernal Machine\\" also deserves credit for craft and subtlety.  The threat of an international conflagration and thenew concept of the \\"horseless carriage\\" are crucial to the resolution of this story, and there's a passage in it where a young inventor asserts that in ten years, everyone in England will drive a horseless carriage.  \\"Everyone?\\" Watson asks.  \\"Come now!\\"<br />Holmes laughs and says, \\"Not you, Watson, not you, I'd wager.\\"<br />How many readers realize that Lutz is paying homage to the last story in the Conan Doyle concordance, \\"His Last Bow\\", set on the eve of the first World War, in which Watson does indeed drive an automobile, in the guise of a chauffeur?  Not many, I'd wager.<br />It must have taken a lot of commendable restraint for Lutz to simply rely on his readers' perspicacity and to resist the sore temptation of finding a way to directly point to the Conan Doyle story.<br />For that matter, Malcom Bell, the villain in the Kaminsky story, may be based upon Dr. Joseph Bell, one of Conan Doyle's medical instructors, who is said to have been the chief inspiration for Conan Doyle's creation of Sherlock Holmes.<br />Stephen King's contribution might be the cleverest, if not the best written.  He apparently wrote his own Sherlock Holmes story in response to a challenge from the editors, but King's normal writing style doesn't quite click with the sober Watsonian chronicling presented by Conan Doyle.<br />And King is usually a good researcher, but this skill fails him on at least two occasions.  He presents us with several images from the Victorian Era that Conan Doyle withheld from delicate sensibilities, including orphans losing all the teeth out of their jaws in sulphur factories by the age of ten and cruel boys in the East End teasing starving dogs with food held out of reach.<br />But the authentic Sherlock Holmes, having learned that Jory Hull was a painter and having deduced that he had no need of monetary support from his cruel father, would have further deduced - without asking Lestrade - that Jory probably gained his independence by painting professionally.<br />And the authentic Holmes, as Watson says in the Conan Doyle classic, \\"A Study in Scarlet\\", has a good practical knowledge of British law.  Stephen King is surely wrong to have Holmes ask Lestrade what sort of treatment the murder suspects might expect to receive under it.<br />Still, we must be grateful to King for bringing to our attention the one case in the lexicon where Watson actually solves the mystery before Holmes does - and yes, it happens in a plausible manner.  As Loren Estleman has pointed out, Holmes's brilliance wouldn't be appreciated by us as much if it were not for the buffer provided by the savvy but unremarkable earnestness of Watson`s narrative.  We admire Holmes, but we empathize more with his Boswell, and it's wonderful to learn of a case in which Watson has his moment in the sunlight.<br />This collection has its share of the good, the bad, the ugly, and the just plain silly (Peter Lovesey`s \\"The Curious Computer\\").  The reader is advised to judge each story on its own merits.  Don't be too impressed with Dame Jean Conan Doyle's endorsement of the volume as a whole.  But do ask, as another renowned English author once did, \\"What's in a name?\\"	2002-12-22
US	50691488	R1BRPDO8REDH4D	027597054X	952314823	Sympathy for the Devil: The Emmanuel Baptist Murders of Old San Francisco	Books	4	13	14	N	N	Marching from Victoria	What exactly is a Victorian murder case anyway?<br />There's a mystique about \\"Victorian murder cases\\" that is possessed by devotees of true crime non-fiction, but it sounds as though all that must happen for a murder or series of crimes to be so regarded is that they take place during the Victorian Era (1837-1901).<br />Of course, the Jack the Ripper murders from 1888 are regarded as the best and the darkest of all Victorian murder cases.  The brutal serial killings of prostitutes, the sexual nature of the crimes themselves, accentuated by the certain body parts which were particularly violated by the Ripper's knife, the exposure of proper British society to the world of prostitution and the seaminess of London's East End - even today, all of these cause right-minded people to solemnly nod their heads and remark on how atrocities are regularly caused by the hypocrisy of blue-blooded aristocrats toward sexual matters.  But does the Theo Durrant case, circa 1895, really fit neatly into this same criminal category just because of its chronology?<br />For the most part, Virginia McConnell is to be commended for her well-researched and comprehensive presentation of the Emmanuel Baptist Church murders.    Durrant was regarded by his contemporaries and by many later researchers simply as a monster, and McConnell's contrary theme, as hinted by the title, is that Durrant was a decent man and a genuine religious devotee of decidedly non-murderous disposition for whom these two murders were isolated acts that likely would not have been repeated.<br />Notwithstanding her moral judgment, she is unsparing in her examination.  She marshals the facts impressively and in chronological order, particularly the testimony of the witnesses who observed Theo Durrant in the company of Blanche Lamont as he escorted her to the church, in which belfry her body was later found.   The circumstantial evidence which led to the quick conviction of Durrant for the murder of  Blanche Lamont (in light of the death sentence imposed upon him, he was never tried for Minnie Williams' death) is impressive for its volume and its probity.  The evidence proffered by Durrant and his attorneys in defense is shown to be wanting; and there is even a suggestion of one or more aborted private confessions by Durrant.<br />McConnell also provides several interesting scenarios as to how and why Durrant murdered the two young women and plausibly maintains that neurological influences (Durrant had suffered from bacterial meningitis) and biochemical influences (she diagnoses Durrant as manic-depressive) likely accounted for his uncharacteristic behavior.  But she also seems inclined to portray the murders as peculiarly Victorian crimes - erotic bloody affronts to a repressive 19th century society, in which some elements were struggling for freedom.<br />However, apart from chronology, it's difficult to see why the Bell Tower murders would be thought of as  Victorian crimes.  Apparently, it's not even necessary that a crime be committed in Victorian ENGLAND to be so classified.  The Emmanuel Baptist Church in San Francisco's Mission District was a good 6000 miles away from Windsor Castle.  More importantly, 19th century San Francisco, with its gin joints and Barbary Coast dens of iniquity, frequented openly by all classes, must have been equally distant from Victorian London in the cultural sense.<br />While McConnell delves extensively into Durrant's family life, she seems to largely overlook its significance.  Papa Durrant was a weak impotent father figure, and Mamma Durrant was an overbearing overly-possessive mother whose affection for her son (as well as the affection that she demanded in return) was unhealthy and unnatural, just the sort of mother that has produced monsters on many other occasions.  Yet McConnell barely acknowledges these elements as contributing factors to the murderous personality that Durrant temporarily developed.<br />The fact is that as over the yearsthat have elapsed since the Bell Tower case, as fatherlessness has become more and more prevalent, the combination of overbearing mothers and weak or absent fathers has been the cause of many thousands of particularly brutal murders and perhaps at least one presidential assassination.  The Durrant case isn't a Victorian murder case at all; it's a 20th century murder case reflecting what would become that century's principal social epidemic.<br />On the other hand, what exactly was Theo Durrant's precise role in the deaths of the two women?  As convincing a case as the author makes for his guilt, she passes lightly over the possible role played by a figure whose shadow never seems entirely absent from this case:  the mysterious Reverend J. George Gibson, pastor of the Emmanuel Baptist Church.<br />A man of very peculiar tendencies, a man who seemed overly eager to protect the church's reputation by hiding the murders from the authorities, a man who brought in handlers from the outside specifically for the purpose of handling inquiries from a suspicious press, a man who indeed should have known the contours of the church at least as well as Theo Durrant (though he denied this in his testimony), Reverend Gibson was widely suspected at the time and was named by Theo's partisans as an alternative suspect.<br />And as unlikely as that might appear, McConnell runs too lightly over Gibson's tendency to \\"hide, ostrich-like and pretend that nothing had happened\\".  She runs too lightly over his flippant and suspicious testimony at the inquest and preliminary hearing and passes these things off as products of his fragile and eccentric nature.  This is particularly faulty in light of her own curiosity as to how Durrant managed to carry Blanche Lamont's body to the belfry by himself.  Her later explanation that adrenaline gave him the strength to do so is not necessarily satisfying.  Was Blanche carried to the belfry by two men?<br />McConnell's book is an impressive work whose narrative delivers slightly less than the research promises.  But it may yet prove to be the Warren Commission Report of the Bell Tower murder case - a weighty tome that is the start of all inquiries but which raises at least as many questions as it answers.	2002-12-14
US	50691488	RKXM797G8XN17	0785813659	20981255	The Big Book of Western Action Stories	Books	4	6	6	N	N	You got a right to pick this little light bonanza.	Sometimes, you really can tell a book by its cover.  My hardcover edition is colored in red and desert gold blends and has got a picture on it of a tough-looking hombre, with a star pinned to his vest, firing a pistol with his left-hand and leaning against his horse's saddle and writing a note with his right hand (\\"rustlers cornered Red Gulch HELP sheriff\\").<br />There isn't any story in this volume that corresponds with this picture, but who cares?  It captures the flavor of the text well enough.<br />Jon Tuska's collection of traditional Western action stories is immensely readable and made especially interesting by his running commentary.  For the most part, these stories were written early in the 20th century as dime novels or as articles contributed to Western periodicals during the Golden Era of this type of story.<br />While all of the tales have the satisfying \\"feel\\" that a good Western action story should bring, it's remarkable to observe that the \\"West\\" is more a state of mind than a geographic point of reference or a specific lifestyle.  The stories are set as far east as Arkansas (which I would have thought of as a \\"Southern\\" state, as opposed to a \\"Western\\" one) and as far north as Montana.<br />The characters from whose vantage point the stories are told include the usual assortment of cowpunchers, sheriffs, ranch detectives, pioneers, and gunfighters, but they also include a construction engineer and a banker.  And although the era of the \\"Old West\\" is believed to have ranged from sometime in the middle of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th, there is actually one story in this volume in which our hero rides, not a Shetland pony, but one of Henry Ford's battered mountain cars (the villain of the piece, by contrast, is a rich kid in a blue roadster).<br />The one common thread that seems to weave relentlessly through all of these stories is the omniscient presence of the \\"Code\\" of the West.  The \\"Code\\" is more easily transmitted to the readerthrough these stories than summarized by any third person, but roughly speaking, it's a series of directives which mandate that promises be kept, that alliances be honored, that grudges be avenged, that individuals communicate plainly (because the difference between friend and foe might depend on the manner in which the other's words or gestures are taken), that obligations be paid, that rights be boldly asserted or forever lost to those who are bolder, that justice be done, that law be taken into one's own hands when necessary to do justice, that crises of the environment or of the spirit be faced head-on, and that (unless otherwise asked) one not pry into the business of another.<br />On occasion, there is confusion over exactly what course of action the \\"Code\\" requires, such as in the first story of the volume where the protagonist must choose between warning a benefactor about a threat to his life and honoring the mandate that one mind his own business.  But most of the time, the \\"right thing to do\\" is fairly clear to the reader.<br />The trouble is that the stories themselves, as entertaining as they are as oat operas, don't quite live up to the billing that the editor gives them as literary devices.<br />\\"There is no other kind of American literary endeavor that has so repeatedly posed the eternal questions - how do I wish to live?, in what do I believe?, what do I want from life?, what have I to give to life? - as has the Western story,\\" Tuska declares.<br />But the fact is that the writers of these stories don't really pose these as \\"questions\\".  There's no doubt that the pioneer families in these stories are going to fulfill their manifest destiny by pressing westward and disregarding all excuses to return home.  There's no doubt that Jim Laramie is going to overcome his fears and repay the hospitality of the family that has befriended him by facing down the badmen who earlier chased him out of Dodge.  There's no doubt that Sheriff Milo Singer's protestations of stupidity and lack of ambition on his own part are facades designed to obscure his relentless pursuit of justice in his territory.  The characters in these stories really don't agonize over these issues long enough to be compared with characters in a Greek drama, as Tuska seeks to do.<br />Almost uniformly morose, taciturn, and persistent and reminiscent of heroes from a similar genre, the hard-boiled detective story, the heroes of the stories in this volume always ultimately follow the Code of the West, not because intense soul-searching enables them to decide that \\"this\\" is how they want to live, but simply because \\"this\\" is a role that their respective authors have designated them to fulfill in order to bring the action to a head.<br />These should be primarily regarded as action stories, not allegories, and the heroes within them, for all their courage and tenacity, are as flat as the Arizona desert and more aptly compared to Horatio than to Hamlet.<br />But as action stories, they work very well, and Tuska is to be commended for his choice of stories; for the loving care that he took to choose them and assemble them for this collection; for the biographical information submitted for each author; and for the memorable introduction to this genre that he provides in his forward.	2002-11-18

It used to be that one could rely on conservatives to mobilize against fashionable evils that arose as a result of breakdowns in social convention.<br />The great conservative theorist Russell Kirk once wrote that any society depends for the foundation and scaffolding of its intellectual life, as for much else, upon the accumulated wisdom of our intellectual and moral patrimony. <br />When these are ignored, Kirk reminded his readers, \\"up starts Sansculotte, many-headed, fire-breathing, crying 'What think ye of me?\\"'<br />The conventional conservative response today is, \\"Not bad, Sansculotte, not bad.  Just improve your appearance and behave yourself, and we'll oblige you.\\"<br />Conservatives used to be comprised of Kirks in shining armor who courageously raised swords against the Hydra's many heads, and the inaugural issue of National Review passionately declared that its purpose was to stand athwart history yelling \\"Stop\\".<br />But no more.  Conservatism has become \\"compassionate\\", wankered, and accommodating, and no better example can be found than that of Jessica Gavora's \\"Tilting the Playing Field\\".<br />The conservababe doesn't object to the Sansculottist atrocity that is female participation in athletics or to the sweaty, virile, androgynous female monsters that this has created, let alone to the larger implications of having them considered as role models.<br />Goodness, no.  She takes great care to remind us of her own athletic background.  She doesn't call for the repeal of Title IX, for which she credits her athletic endeavors.  Instead, she reminds us (and this is certainly useful from a historic perspective) of the bill's conservative and Republican origins:  authored by Cap Weinberger, sponsored by the very conservative Senator Tower, and signed by Richard Nixon.<br />The 1999 binge that was the celebration of the \\"triumph\\" of the U.S. Women's Soccer Team was nothing less than organized war on males.<br />It may have been female vs. female on the playing field.  But the official line, repeated over and over by the tournament's organizers and by the news media, was that the ability of one female soccer team to triumph over a number of other female soccer teams was (in some mysterious way) proof of female superiority and of male irrelevance.  \\"Girls rule; boys drool; soccer's cool,\\" was the rallying cry of American girls and women.<br />Jessica Gavora doesn't distance herself from this misandry; she rides the dragon cowboy-style on bareback, waving her cap and whooping, as she joins it.  She simply argues that Title IX shouldn't get the credit for this \\"triumph\\" since it was actually the result of a radical change in ideas about sexual roles and female destiny.<br />Yes, this is a self-declared female \\"conservative\\" CHEERING these radical changes and throwing her own reserve of fuel onto the dragon's misandric fire.  Gavora is indeed a \\"conservative\\" in the sense that she feels that the masculinization of women and the war on biological males should be organized by private industry and local civic groups, rather than by the federal government.<br />Gavora certainly has a point, as far as it goes.  Legal monstrosities such as Title IX and the Violence Against Women Act and various versions of the Evil Rights Amendment aren't really necessary in order to impose and maintain the Matriarchy.  The man-haters captured the culture and the media a long time ago and can certainly operate without overt legal sanction.  Gavora is one of them, and since misandry isn't derived from the accumulated wisdom of the ages, her \\"conservatism\\" is obviously absent from the culture war.  But the laws that the man-haters sometimes impose serve as a victory dance, and Gavora appears to think that such gestures are unseemly.<br />And her conscience is troubled - this might be another example of where her \\"conservatism\\" comes in.   She provides extensive documentation on how male athletic programs are being sacrificed to the Title IX volcanoin order to meet quotas, and she feels that that's just plain unfair. Behave, Sansculotte.  After all, she giggles, female university students are surpassing male students in academics, and she certainly isn't recommending that any remedial action be taken to better the lot of males in the classroom.  So, she reasons, let the guys have their sports.<br />Title IX, she assures us, wasn't meant to impose numerical quotas that would limit male opportunities to participate in sports (Oh, do tell!).  So her response to the devastation wrought in its name is not the truly conservative plea for a return to traditional social mores but simply that the law be enforced according to its \\"original intent\\".  And she defines \\"original intent\\" as that of having Big Sister require schools to actively pervert girls and women by recruiting them into the masculine culture of athletics, without using  quotas to determine compliance.<br />The hostility that Gavora has received from FEMINIST critics is truly remarkable, but it doesn't prove anything other than that feminism is a rigid discipline which permits no straying from the party line.  But these feminist critics can rest easy.  As fellow NR conservababe Kathryn Jean Lopez has stated, Gavora has not written a polemic against female sports.  Is there an author out there who will?	2002-11-17
US	50691488	R2KPQYGCDASSUT	087833212X	95926521	Baby Bull: From Hardball to Hard Time and Back	Books	3	6	8	N	N	Cepeda vs. Franks:  He said/he said	I tend to prefer my baseball books pure, untainted by \\"larger\\" themes (as though there were any).<br />I knew that this book, billed as a frank autobiography of Orlando Cepeda, would deal with his conviction for smuggling marijuana.  But I am interested purely in his baseball career and was planning not to take much interest in what happened afterwards.<br />And yet, it must be confessed that Orlando's story of the disgrace that he suffered among his fellow Puerto Ricans after his arrest and conviction and how Buddhism helped him to overcome his difficulties and make peace with the world and find his way back into major league baseball was a moving one.  Especially touching is the story of his reunion with a son sired out of wedlock.<br />But the story of his personal experience with weed is uncomfortably vague.  He acknowledges having smoked it as a youth in Puerto Rico and that he picked up the habit again in 1965, while still with the Giants, to relieve stress after a particularly bad run-in with The Evil One, Manager Herman Franks.<br />Yet Orlando appears to have become as happy as a clam after having been traded to the Cardinals in 1966, and this is certainly reflected in his performance while with the Cardinals and in the championship seasons that \\"El Birdos\\" compiled with him on the roster.<br />So with the stress gone, did he continue to smoke pot as a Cardinal?  And with the teams that he played on afterwards?  How did this affect his performance at game time?  Orlando simply does not tell us.<br />Still, it's \\"Baseball Forever\\", and baseball purists will be glad to know that most of this book is set in between the foul lines.  This is a familiar-sounding story of a youngster who grew up in poverty, despite having been born the son of Puerto Rico's most celebrated ballplayer, the great Perucho Cepeda.  Perucho was known as \\"The Bull\\", and Orlando's nickname, which is the title of this book, was naturally passed onto him.<br />He used his natural ability (presumably also inherited from his father) and effort to overcome prejudice in the United States and build a storybook career.<br />The year-by-year recapitulation of his performance and that of the teams he played on is interesting but unremarkable and gives the reader a chance to reacquaint himself with the players from that era.  What I primarily wanted to hear was Orlando's version of his alleged refusal to move from first base to left field in order to enable the Giants to get both his big bat and that of Willie McCovey into the lineup in a way which would not sacrifice too much defense (McCovey was not mobile enough to play left field effectively).<br />It is remarkable that a team laden with as much talent as the San Francisco Giants of the 1950's and 1960's won only one National League pennant, and many blame this on Cha-Cha's alleged refusal to make the switch to left.<br />In interviews conducted by Steve Bitker for his book, \\"The Giants of `58\\", Herman Franks repeats this charge, and Orlando sidesteps it.  But even Bill Rigney, revered by Orlando as a father figure, states that he thinks that the Giants would have won the pennant in 1959 (McCovey's Rookie of the Year season) if Orlando would have been more cooperative.<br />Again, Orlando is uncomfortably vague in dealing with this issue, stating only that by 1966, he was ready to try to become the best left-fielder in baseball but that Herman Franks was already set on getting rid of him.  But McCovey and Cepeda had played together for six years before 1966 (Cepeda was hurt for virtually all of 1965).  What of those years?<br />The statistical comparisons from those years of how often Orlando played the outfield and of McCovey's at-bats and Orlando's might provide a slightly better defense of Orlando than he does of himself.<br />After 1959, 1962 seems to be the only year in which McCovey, while healthy, might have been deprived of at-bats because of Orlando's possible resistance to playing left field.  Yet the Giants won the pennant that year and so this resistance appears not to have cost them.<br />But while McCovey does not appear to have been deprived of at-bats during those other years, he mostly played left field in 1963 and 1964, and played it poorly, while Cepeda was anchoring first.  Would a switch have made enough of a difference to mean a Giants pennant?  The statistics show that Orlando played creditably in left field in 1960 and 1961.<br />Cepeda also responds to Herman Franks's charge that he was a poor clutch hitter by pointing to his 553 RBI's garnered over his first five seasons.  It's an astounding number, but it includes a monstrous 1961 season in which Orlando produced 142 \\"ribbies\\", which staggers the five-year total somewhat.  From 1958 to 1960, he averaged slightly under 100 RBI's a season.<br />100 RBI's is usually a sterling number, but RBI's, by themselves, do not a clutch hitter make.  Runs batted in during the early stages of a close game might make a difference later but are not the stuff that heroes are made of.<br />And runs produced when one's team is hopelessly ahead or behind are meaningless.  But situational statistics weren't kept in Orlando's day so the case for him having been a good or a bad \\"clutch\\" hitter can only be made through anecdotal evidence, which is lacking in both the Cepeda and Franks accounts.<br />So to this day, it remains unresolved whether Orlando's complaints about being under-appreciated are valid - or just a lot of Baby Bull.	2002-11-10
US	50691488	R14GIMBYJRWF5R	0446674362	282618499	The Black Dahlia	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Hello Dahlia!	Los Angeles has more than its share of renowned homicides, and the murder afficionado can spend many a pleasant (!) weekend here visiting landmarks and chasing ghosts.<br />The Brown/Goldman murders are of the most recent vintage, but there was also Marilyn Monroe, George Reeves, Thelma Todd, RFK - this is just a partial list.<br />But the brutal 1947 slaying of the Black Dahlia, Elizabeth Short, might head the list or finish a close second to Brown/Goldman (the \\"O.J. case\\").<br />At the time that this novel was written, however, its narrative might already have been superceded by events since the Los Angeles Police Department reportedly paid a visit to a suspect in the Dahlia slaying as recently as 1981 and found him dead in a flophouse hotel (shades of Scotland Yard and Montague John Druitt in December 1888).<br />Nevertheless, no one was ever brought to trial for the Dahlia's murder, so the case is still regarded in the public eye as \\"unsolved\\".  And no more appropriate author could be chosen for a fictitious treatment of the Black Dahlia murder than James Ellroy, the master of the \\"noir\\" story, though this 1987 novel is a fairly early example of it.<br />Told from the viewpoint of boxing cop, Bucky Bleichert, the story of the Dahlia murder and investigation is very much colored by the triangle connecting Bleichert with his buddy and pugilistic partner, Lee Blanchard, and the woman whose love they both share.<br />It really does help to live in the Los Angeles area to fully appreciate this story and the time in which it is set.  For the most part, since the end of World War II, Los Angeles has followed the path traveled by other major cities - time, regression, culture clash and massive immigration have turned much of it into a slum or Third World country.  Yet, the dirty back alley on 39th and Norton where the Dahlia's mutilated corpse was found no longer exists, and the area has evolved into a decent residential neighborhood, bucking the regressive trend.<br />There's one scene where Bleichert follows up on a tip and cruises the 11000 block of Ventura Boulevard (he uses the Cahuenga Pass to get there from the downtown station, presumably because the 101 Freeway does not yet exist), visiting a number of lezzie bars.  I presume that Ellroy did his research, but it's hard to look at the usual urban assortment of bideaway motels, strip malls, restaurants, and shops that are in the area now and consider that this block ever harbored anything as outre as a lezzie bar.<br />The social climate is also different from today&#146;s, of course, especially in the police station.  Los Angeles cops are portrayed as being even more vile, crude, and corruptible in 1947 than they are today, if that's possible, though the city seems to run smoothly enough under the kind attention of mobster Mickey Cohen.  Bleichert isn't that much different from the others, but he's just different enough to earn empathy from the reader.<br />I suppose that's my main criticism of this novel - of ANY Ellroy story:  the fact that Ellroy is always cutting out the black heart of the post-war era and shoving it, ventricles and all, into his readers' faces.  If you're like me, you treasure the post WW2 era as a Renaissance era in which Buddy Holly and Elvis Presley stirred the juices of American youth; America stood strong and proud under Ike; the three greatest centerfielders in baseball all played within a few miles of each other in the same metropolitan area; and millions of housewives, without any thought of \\"self actualization\\" through a career of their own, were staying home and raising strong and healthy families.<br />If that's too idyllic, then Ellroy errs in the opposite direction, showing us too much of the harshness and racial divisiveness of this period.  In fact, there MUST have been millions of families with lifestyles similar to that of the Cleavers and thousands of cops as upright as Joe Friday, but Ellroy scarcely hints at their existence.<br />The only visible character living the \\"squarejohn\\" life is Bleichert's supervisor, the affable family man and \\"good cop\\", Lieutenant Russ Millard, who regularly greets a picture of Elizabeth Short hanging in his office with the promise \\"I'll get him, dear\\".  But his presence casts a very dim light through the sleaze that is otherwise displayed in Ellroy's conception of the Los Angeles Police Department.<br />The novel suffers from the absence of a more visible \\"squarejohn\\" presence and the welcome contrast that this would provide, but the author's noir style is incapable of<BR>accommodating such a presence, and the reader must shrug his shoulders and take Ellroy as he finds him.<br />As the dedication notes, this novel was actually written as a \\"benediction in blood\\" to Ellroy's own mother, who also died brutally, and where Ellroy really shines is the way in which he is able to magnify and enshrine the Black Dahlia, Elizabeth Short, whom we never even meet while she is alive.  A story simply repeating the canard about a wanna-be actress who found fame in death that she could never find in Hollywood while she was alive would have been too banal for Ellroy and an insufficient tribute to his mother.<br />It is remarkable to instead behold how the Dahlia's presence becomes so powerful AFTER her death as to utterly envelope the lives of those connected with the investigation of it.  By novel's end, she has metamorphosed into a goddess, reaching to touch Bleichert's outstretched hand in a noir novel version of the famous Michelangelo painting.<br />It was not narcissistic love of his own artistry that caused Ellroy to weep as he wrote the ending.	2002-11-10

What are the images that come to mind?<br />Obsessed crazed nut, stalker, psychopath, potential terrorist, murderer, rapist.  Get a gun and shoot him in self-defense.  Or, at the very least, his desire for revenge is seen as just another example of the boorish childishness of men.<br />Quick, think of a woman who wants to get even with a man that she feels has wronged her.  What are the images that come to your mind?<br />Wronged woman getting even with a \\"jerk\\".  Blackmail him.  Expose the skeletons in his closet.  Kick him....  Female-on-male revenge is always righteous and it sure is \\"fun\\".  It's the staple of many works of entertainment; just look at all the members of the gentler sex in the theater cheering on Jennifer Lopez as she throttles a man to death.  A generation ago, their mothers cheered on Ali McGraw for much the same thing.<br />A woman's desire to get even with a man isn't dangerous or childish, of course; it's just proof that you can't keep a good woman down.<br />Yes, a little study of the revenge industry shows it heavily steeped in femi-sexism, and this book, written by two Englishwomen, Jane Inder and Hilary Eyre, is no different.<br />\\"Hilary\\" is certainly an appropriate first name for an author of a revenge book, and to the extent that the male/female dichotomy is discussed, Jane and Hilary seem to design their commentary with the assumption that they are addressing a wronged woman justifiably desiring revenge against a male jerk.<br />For that matter, the discussion doesn't center exclusively on relationships.  The authoresses gleefully repeat the Greek myth of how Artemis, the goddess of hunting and chastity, turns the hunter Actaeon into a stag and sics his own dogs on him to eat him alive.  Actaeon's capital crime was that of having ogled Artemis while she was bathing naked.  Punishable by mutilation and death, of course.<br />Obviously, life hasn'tchanged much since the days of ancient Greese.  Women still regard themselves as goddesses, and they still regard male sexuality as a capital offense.<br />Still, the authors don't recommend this or any other violent method as a means of getting even; for that matter, they don't recommend that any of the \\"revenge\\" schemes that they discuss ever actually be used.  The book has the expected disclaimer that these schemes are all being suggested \\"for entertainment purposes only\\".  Of course.<br />To be honest, these authors seem a little more self-conscious of their femi-sexism than are others of their ilk.  Once in a while, they allow for the concept of a wronged man.  Or the bitchy co-worker.  And not all revenge schemes stem from the male/female dichotomy anyway.  The stuffy bureaucrat, the neighbor who lets his dogs and cats poop over your lawn, and the troublesome supervisor, could be of any gender and so could the one wanting revenge against them.<br />But the book also suffers from Anglocentrism.  Apparently Londoners themselves, Jane & Hillary assume that all of their readers are English, a naïve assumption in the global electronic village that we now live in.  Admittedly, this was less true in 1994 when this book was published.  Still, if you are going to run a newspaper ad for a lost dog in the name of your target, it's useful to know that the most common dog breeds in the UK are German Shepards, Labradors, and Jack Russells, but only if you live in the UK.  What about the revenge-fantasy-minded American, Canadian, or Australian?<br />I can't help but admire the twist on the old pizza trick though.  Ordering a pizza to be delivered to a total stranger, just to play a prank on the pizza parlor, is ancient and pointless, and the pizza parlor these days insists on a call-back phone number to double-check.  On the other hand, posting leaflets all over town giving your target's telephone number and advertising 24-hour delivery of discount pizzas is a stroke of brilliance.<br />But in large part, the schemes in this book smack of a great deal of naivete.  They assume that you have access to your target's home or office or telephone or automobile.  <Heck>, what if your target lives out of town?<br />And they assume that you ALREADY know of your target's most embarrassing secrets.  One who already has such access or such knowledge can probably come up with his own imaginative revenge schemes and doesn't need a book such as this to suggest them.  And after the damage is done, how could one with such access or knowledge maintain a pretense of innocence anyway?<br />Besides, I think that the Internet effectively does away with personally-crafted revenge schemes.   Why should anyone go to a great deal of time, effort, and expense to develop such schemes now?  The cyber-head has enough knowledge at his disposal to  make miserable the lives of others from his terminal.<br />And for about 20 bucks, the rest of us can visit any number of revenge-theme web pages, punch in our credit card numbers, and from the safety and comfort of our living rooms, order a melted box of candy or a dead fish to be anonymously delivered to our target.  No fuss, no muss (not on our end) and quite possibly, not even illegal.<br />Your target might know or suspect that it was you, but she (heh-heh; assuming a female target) can't prove it.<br />Or if we just want to fantasize about doing that sort of thing, that certainly isn't illegal or costly.<br />Horns may protrude from my head and bloodthirsty hunting dogs may bay at my door.  But secure in my anonymity, I give the Witches of London three stars for effort and deduct one star for femi-sexism.	2002-09-29
US	50691488	R3HTSA2TJR7J6X	1566397960	555799862	Land of the Giants: New York's Polo Grounds	Books	4	5	6	N	Y	Once there were Giants	This is a concise but thorough story of one of baseball's most fabled stadiums.  As many of the old classic ballparks go the way of the wrecking ball, such accounts become more and more necessary.<br />The Polo Grounds met its demise as long ago as 1964, but it is likely to continue to have a hold on baseball fans long after some of the newer monstrosities which were built and/or abandoned afterwards (I.e., Riverfront Stadium, Houston Astrodome, Three Rivers Stadium) have been long forgotten.<br />Many of those who pick up this book will already know that the New York National League baseball team (which was known as the \\"Mutuals\\" before it became the \\"Giants\\") actually played in four different ballparks known as the Polo Grounds and that polo was never played in any but the first one (the succeeding ones simply kept the name for familiarity's sake).<br />But this book will add some breadth and scope to that knowledge.  The author, Stew Thornley, has nothing new to add concerning the most famous events that took place there.  At this late date, what more is there to be said about Merkle's Boner, Zimmerman's Boner, Snodgrass's Muff, Merkle's Second Boner, Hubbell's 1934 All Star Game performance, The Shot Heard Round the World, or Willie's Catch?<br />On the other hand, would you believe that Willie Mays's first Polo Grounds home run took place before his 1951 rookie season with the Giants?  How and when?  I didn't know before reading this book.<br />Thornley also seems to have swallowed the myth that a vengeful Brooklyn Dodgers team beat the Giants in 1934 to spoil their pennant chances and get even for the slight that Bill Terry inflicted when he asked, \\"Is Brooklyn still in the league?\\"  The story is part of Giant-Dodger lore, and all of those events took place, except that it is likely that Terry's question was really an innocent response to a rumor circulating over that franchises's future.<br />Thornley's principal contribution concerns the political and business history of the four ballparks, as well as their dimensions and how they affected baseball as it was played there.  But while there are some wonderful photographs in the centerpieces of the book, Thornley fails  to integrate them with his technical descriptions of the ballparks' dimensions.  Some maps of old New York and some diagrams of the four ballparks facing the pages containing the descriptions would have been helpful.<br />There were not only once baseball giants at Polo Grounds IV but football giants too.  Boxing and other athletic events also took place, and, in a separate chapter, Thornley dutifully pays homage to the Grounds's non-baseball history.<br />Regarding Polo Grounds I, where the Giants played from 1883 to 1888, it is described as a \\"difficult place to hit home runs\\".  As Thornley states, \\"Total Baseball lists the home run factor for the east diamond as 71, with 100 being average; this means that home runs were reduced by nearly 30 percent...because of the characteristics of the ballpark itself.\\"<br />Thornley continues, \\"However, the Giants had a slugger capable of reaching not just the outfield fences but the property fences that provided the outside border to the stadium itself.\\"  The slugger was Hall of Famer Roger Connor, described by another historian as \\"the premier power hitter of the `Gaslight Era'\\", and Thornley recapitulates a contemporary description from 1886 of a Connor home run traveling majestically over the right field stands and into a field across 112th Street.<br />A Giants baseball team playing its home games in a pitcher's ballpark, stingy with home runs, but having in its lineup the premier home run hitter of the era, a left-handed slugger and future Hall of Famer capable of overcoming the park's dimensions by muscling baseballs entirely out of it.<br />Thornley deserves thanks for reminding his readers that after 116 years and a move to the West Coast, the more baseball changes, the more it remains the same.	2002-09-15
US	50691488	R2RCPMGQEX2VAO	1589800176	482880923	Best Editorial Cartoons of the Year: 2002 Edition	Books	2	12	22	N	N	Androgenized artists can't carry a "toon"	The \\"Best Editorial Cartoons of the Year\\" series has been around for at least 30 years now.<br />I know this because I actually remember the 1972 and 1973 editions.  The differences between those editions and this one show how far the art of political satire has declined and how far the Matriarchy has progressed.<br />We're never told what standard is used to rate a particular cartoon as among the \\"best\\" of the year, and it's fairly safe to say that it's purely based on the subjective preference of the editor, Charles Brooks.  And this much has to be said for him - he includes cartoons from a number of perspectives but leaves out left-wing heavy hitters such as Conrad, Trudeau, and the recently deceased Herblock (did they hit him in the head with a shovel to make sure?).  This is important for balance, simply because there are no right-wing heavy hitters among political cartoonists to even the score.<br />For the most part, the cartoons included in all collections have been from relatively obscure contributors - both left and right.  This is all to the good.<br />But this year's edition was just a lot of pap.  For one thing, Gary Condit had been the big story before September 11.  Where are the Condit cartoons?<br />Of course, the biggest story in 2001 turned out to be the terrorist attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center. So the \\"best\\" cartoons mostly repeat conventional sentiment - what a tragedy, but we're strong and united now so we'll get the bastards, blah blah blah.<br />How many cartoons were drawn which showed the Statue of Liberty, Uncle Sam, and the American Eagle alternatively weeping, praying, retaliating etc. etc.?  What a self-replicating show of pompous victimologistic self-assuming virtue!<br />Incisive masculine wit is disappearing from the modern political cartoon, and cartoons that are supposed to make you EMOTE without THINKING have become the rule.<br />Get a load of the contribution from Richard Wallmeyer of the Long Beach Press Telegram about \\"anti-bully\\" legislation.  In the penultimate panel, one kid suggests that people just live by the Golden Rule instead of passing a law and in the last panel, his friend responds by reminding him that religion isn't allowed in public schools.<br />That's it.  No wit; no nuance; no attempt to make the reader THINK about what the cartoonist is trying to say.  No symbolism even.  Wallmeyer tells you straight out  what you should believe.<br />And Jeff Parker's post-September 11 contribution from Florida Today showing two Floridians wearing \\"I Love NY\\" paraphernalia and agreeing between themselves that \\"We are all New Yorkers now\\".<br />No biting masculine wit, no nuance, no intellect, no symbolism.  And suck a lozenge, Jeff Parker.  All of the terrorists attacks in the world won't turn the average New Yorker into a human being, any more than the 1989 earthquake could do so for the average San Franciscan.  Parker is just engaging in cheap sentiment masquerading as patriotism.<br />The decline in quality of political cartoons stems from the fact that as women continue to make war on men and as the Matriarchy's grip becomes more crushing, male cartoonists have become softer and more effeminate (this is happening in other settings too, obviously).<br />And more women have become political cartoonists.  There's an Ann Telnaes cartoon in which Joseph Lieberman's statement at Notre Dame that public morality should be based on faith is juxtaposed against a picture of Moslem women wearing veils.<br />Even assuming that it's BAD for women to hide their features, is it really accurate to suppose that a faith-based public morality would require an imposition of the burqua?  No more than it would require baptism or a kosher diet but in a feminized world, the reader is not supposed to think but to emote, emote, emote.<br />Of course, as anyone who has seen her recurring appearances on C-SPAN knows, as a political cartoonist, Ann Telnaes is one hot babe whose face definitely should NOT be covered.   But her cartoons would only be improved by the camouflage that a veil would provide.  They are hardly worthy of inclusion among the country's \\"best\\".<br />And the feminization of the American political cartoon isn't just limited to matters of style. <br />Resistance to the Matriarchy has become unthinkable.  In the 1973 edition, there is an entire section devoted to \\"Women's Lib\\", most of the contributions deliciously skewering the feminazis.<br />In one uproarious example, a man is standing at the altar looking apprehensive while hooked in his arm is his \\"bride\\", a man in drag.  The preacher performing the \\"marriage\\" ceremony asks the \\"groom\\", \\"Do you, John, promise to love, honor and obey the Equal Rights Amendment?\\"<br />Go try to find a cartoon like that today!  We've come a long way from when Thomas Nast cartoons afflicted and ultimately defeated party bosses such as Bill Tweed.  Today's feminist bosses have no reason to moan, \\"Stop them damned pictures!\\"  The people drawing them come from the same New Class that their masters do.<br />So where gender issues are concerned, the drawing board cult members bow their collective heads in deference to the \\"women are strong and good; men are weak and bad and deserving of punishment\\" party line.  The 2002 edition shows an androgenized Statue of Liberty punching a Taliban member in the face in a display of women's \\"rights\\" (get it?  She`ll throw her \\"left\\" at him next).<br />The Evil Rights Amendment might not have been enacted, but feminism has still become the official state religion of both left and right.  As such,  it stifles masculine energy, independence, and creativity.  These can only return when and if a younger generation of males rebels against the imposition of public morality in the name of this particular faith.<br />Until then, the quality of written protest, in the form of political animation, can be expected to continuously decline.  But I wonder what the 2032 edition of \\"Best Editorial Cartoons\\" will look like.	2002-08-25
US	50691488	R1VRI2TQM1ZTYA	0910137471	714706648	Baseball: The Fan's Game	Books	5	0	0	N	N	SABR rattles off a magnificent reprint!	The Society of American Baseball Research (SABR) is to be commended for reprinting his marvelous  baseball artifact.<br />Sixty-three years after this book originally came out to celebrate baseball's 100th anniversary, a strong case can still be made that Gordon S. Cochrane of Bridgewater, Massachusetts, dubbed \\"Mickey\\" by a Pacific Coast League owner who wanted a Boston Irishman for promotional purposes, was the greatest catcher of all time.<br />Never mind the inebriated Cochrane-sucker ingrate who spurned Ty Cobb's generosity during the 1960 Hall of Fame ceremonies in the Tommie Lee Jones movie.  In 1939, he appears to have been very much in love with the game and with life, if this book is any indication (though, in fact, he had already suffered a nervous breakdown and from a wild pitch that had fractured his skull).  He couldn't have known it at the time, but when Mutt Mantle's son was born eight years earlier, his father already had a baseball future in mind for him, and young Mantle was indeed named after the Philadelphia A's star catcher.<br />This book will teach you almost all of what you need to know to be a successful major league catcher-manager.  Almost?  Well, as the author informs us, he could always hit, and he always knew that he could hit, no matter what league he was playing in.  So there's not a tremendous amount of hitting instruction contained in this book, and the reader will gain more from it, if, like the author, he is ALREADY naturally able to hit .300 against big-league pitching (Cochrane's lifetime batting average was .320).<br />Such hitting instruction as there is in this book might be more entertaining than helpful.  On the one hand, he urges, \\"Take a strike.  Take two strikes to get the ball you want to hit.\\".  But at another point, he remarks that when you are facing a pitcher with good control, first-ball swinging, rather than allowing oneself to fall behind on the count, sometimes produces rallies.<br />He's mildly contradicting himself with his hitting advice, certainly, and that's to be expected when someone tries to give instruction on something that he can do naturally and instinctively.<br />But we are reminded that all hitters, even the greatest, will have bouts of sustained failure.<br />\\"Batting slumps are about as pleasant as an income-tax threat or the threat of a truant officer over a small boy's head.  At some time or other, all ball players meet `Miss Slump' in person.  Base hits become as alien as beef stew in the tropics.\\"<br />Damn, if only we still lived in a world where people in general and ballplayers in particular talked like this!<br />But in an era that preceded the designated hitter, Cochrane had to play some position in the field that would get his bat in the lineup, even though he also suggests that if you can hit, they will always find a place for you.  Still, long hours of hard work to turn himself from a hopeless catcher to a great one show in his detailed instruction.<br />Catcher was always my favorite position because the catcher guards the last outpost that must be reached by a hostile opposing  base runner before he scores a run.  My greatest moment on the sandlot involved leaping up high to snare a wild throw and then tagging a would-be tying run out at home plate.  And Mickey naturally pays great homage to this aspect of a catcher's job.  Get in front of every throw!  Block the base runner off, if you can!  And if you have to move away from the plate to receive the throw, dive at the plate with the ball, not at the base runner.<br />How unchanging is the game?  Well, there are passages in this book that will raise some eyebrows with their familiarity.  The defensive \\"shift\\" that opposing players put on for Babe Ruth seems to greatly resemble not only the later \\"Ted Williams\\" shift but the one imposed against a contemporary baseball giant, whose name is often mentioned in connection with Ruth's.<br />And thirty-three years before the American League established the designated hitter rule as a means of replacing weak-hitting pitchers in the lineup with regular hitters, Cochrane - explaining why he and his contemporary American League managers disdain the sacrifice bunt early in the game - declares that the American League is the league of the \\"big inning\\", where if one run is going to beat you, you might as well concede the game before you leave the clubhouse.<br />This is historical evidence that the American League's contemporary reputation as an offense-happy league doesn't stem from its relatively recent predilection for designated hitters and Astro Turf ballparks, but rather that these changes were adopted as a result of a pre-existing pro-offense philosophy<br />But there are noticeable differences between the baseball eras too, of course.  Cochrane informs the aspiring manager that his four best pitchers must start but that he needs two good relievers, as well.  He's not anticipating an age of specialization where a team will carry as many relievers as starters, where the relievers will have varying specializations, and where a \\"closer\\" who throws for one inning to finish a game can possess \\"star\\" luster, equal to that of the starter.<br />Mickey would have reached his 100th birthday next April 6 if cancer had not taken him in 1962, and this book is also proof that, regardless of experience and expertise, you never live long enough to see everything that can take place in a baseball game.  <br />Referring back to the catcher`s Horatio-like role as the final barrier between the runner and home plate, Cochrane declares, \\"No one has yet made a putout without the ball.\\"  Begorrah Mickey, if you could have only lived long enough to see the 1970 World Series between the Cincinnati Reds and the Baltimore Orioles, you would have seen Oriole catcher, Elrod Hendricks, do just that to Bernie Carbo.  Thanks for this and for all of your contributions, me bucko!	2002-08-24
US	50691488	R1AJUP8GK0PNB9	0312206720	814253814	Shallow Grave in Trinity County	Books	4	5	21	N	N	Shallow members of an Unholy Trinity	Rule No. 1 when reading a \\"true crime\\" story where you don't already know the ending and want to be surprised is to avoid the photos and captions inset in the middle of the book, until you've already finished it.<br />The photos and captions will give the ending away every time if you don't wait to look at 'em.  I learned that the hard way when I first read the Joe McGinness book on Jeffrey MacDonald (\\"Fatal Vision\\").<br />As far as this book goes, it's not quite clear what author Harry Farrell hoped to accomplish in writing it.  The story is about the arrest of Burton Abbott for the brutal abduction and murder of 14-year old Stephanie Bryant in mid-1955 from an enclosed thicket of shrubbery near her home in Berkeley, California and also about Abbott`s subsequent trial.  Did Farrell simply mean to tell this story in a way that would intrigue his readers?<br />Then I'd say that he succeeded.  This was a very interesting read.<br />But I also suspect that what Farrell really meant to do was to write a \\"did-he-or-didn't-he\\" story; that is, to create suspense as to the accused's guilt or innocence and as to the outcome of the trial.  And I'd say that he got no better than mixed results there.<br />I faithfully AVOIDED the photo section in the middle of the book, but any sense of suspense that I might have experienced was a sham.  I kept waiting in vain for the revelation that would cause me to consider the case in a new light.  But the evidence as it is shown here remained quite one-sided throughout, and the outcome was inevitable.<br />In fact, I'm not quite sure that I trust Farrell entirely.  Even if this was a capital case, his presentation of it makes one wonder what exactly the jury deliberated about for seven days.  Unless, of course, Farrell left out one or more things that might have given pause to a responsible jury.<br />What I found particularly interesting was not how much the criminal justice system has changed over the intervening half century but how much it hasn't changed.<br />The same cast of characters showed up for this high-profile case that have shown up in so many others.<br />There is, of course, first and foremost, The State with seemingly infinite resources at its command to grind into powder any criminal defendant that comes within its maw - whether or not justice is really served thereby.<br />\\"Resources\\" don't just mean the money to foot expenses that only the wealthiest of defendants could assume, such as a dossier of personal information on many of the prospective jurors.<br />\\"Resources\\" also include The State's lengthy tentacles in the form of spies and stool-pigeons, judiciously placed in the trusting presence of the accused and his associates in order to inform.  And the County of Alameda, it seems, had no shortage of talkative infantry working for it in order to ensnare Burton Abbott.<br />Yes, The State has a remarkable propensity for bringing out the best in human nature, and any legal beagle can tell you that if the accused is TRICKED, instead of coerced into disclosing damning information - why, his right to avoid self-incrimination isn't being compromised at all.<br />The cast also includes The Defense Team, which makes up in gall for what it lacks in resources and authority by utilizing what capital it has to gather dirt on all adverse witnesses and by using back-alley tactics in the courtroom that a seasoned gang-banger wouldn't be ashamed to own, in order to ensure that it is the witnesses themselves, and not the accused, who are put on trial.<br />But most prominent are Saint Unfortunates; that is, the members of the family of the murder victim, always haughtily assuming the Mantle of Victimhood Itself, always stoically and courageously bearing up in the presence of the press under the horrible tragedy, and ALWAYS appearing, of course, at the right hand of The State when called upon.<br />In the annals of true crime, has any Saint Unfortunate ever refused to ally himself or herself asa partner of The State?  Has any Saint Unfortunate ever expressed disapproval of The State's tactics?  Let alone express uncertainty about the case made by The State against the accused?<br />As far as I know, this has never happened; otherwise, the public from whom the prospective jurors are drawn might actually feel that it's sometimes necessary to draw a distinction between \\"Justice for the Victim's Family\\" and rubber-stamping The State's case against the accused.<br />In this story, the arrogantly-aggrieved parents of Stephanie Bryant do indeed play to the hilt their roles as martyrs and State suck-ups.<br />And, of course, gazing down from her perch in Heaven on this scene enacted by the Unholy Trinity, her wings still flapping and her halo perfectly adjusted - is The Victim Herself and, as tearfully invoked by The State, the legacy of what she would now never have the opportunity to become.<br />Indeed, Alameda County D.A. Frank Coakley piously reads an unfinished letter composed by The Victim Herself and, with presumably perfect timing, sobs into his handkerchief at its conclusion.<br />All cast members are present and accounted for in this saga, but setting aside my suspicions, Farrell does as good a job as any of weaving the same old story in a uniquely entertaining way.<br />It must be acknowledged, of course, though Farrell fails to, that the post-1955 advent of Miranda, the public defender industry, and the exclusionary rule have given criminal defense attorneys similar license to abuse authority and pervert justice.<br />But what of the accused in this case, Burton Abbott?  If he was innocent, then he was a victim of the machinations of the Unholy Trinity.  And if he was guilty, his motives, for all of their baseness, actually seem more pure than the motives of those who fought over his life.  Let that be a salvageable remnant of HIS legacy.	2002-08-15

To coin a phrase made notorious by Barry himself, are baseball fans still missing the show?<br />This particular book is about author Josh Suchon's experience of Barry's record-breaking 2001 baseball season, which had the baseball world agog.  And Suchon makes the mistake of allowing himself to become too close to his subject, even acknowledging that he envisions his book on Barry's bookshelf.  But the book is not a \\"whitewash\\", as others have claimed.  The title is based on the Shakespeare quotation set forth after the title page, and, in the present context, the word \\"gracious\\" is meant to describe Bonds's performance and not Barry himself.<br />Suchon doesn't deny Barry's shortcomings; he simply places them in the perspective of his other qualities such as his work ethic and his willingness to play in pain.<br />He also places Bonds's shortcomings in the perspective of the demands made on his time, the expectations held of him, the behavior of other ballplayers, and the context of the given situation.  These are better derived from the book than described by me, but, to take one example, the infamous \\"Barry's corner\\" of the Giant clubhouse exists largely for therapeutic purposes.  The $3,000 couch on which he lounges is a vibrating couch that heals his back, which was purchased by Barry, and not the team.<br />Beyond that, Suchon misses very little.  Like Ishmael, he makes his presence known but wisely does not impose too much of himself in describing events as they unfold, knowing full well that the story in itself is remarkable enough.<br />Suchon covers the season from beginning to end, including the Giants' failure to sign Bonds to a long term contract before his \\"option\\" season started; and his relationship with his father, Bobby Bonds - an ex-Giant and star in his own right - and Bobby's teammates, Barry's godfather, Willie Mays and his boyhood idol, Willie McCovey.  As a young  boy, Barry was a fixture in the Giant clubhouse and would gaze at the players whose records he would someday chase.<br />Barry's present-day complex relationship with the Giant front office and with his manager, teammates, and opponents, as well as the peaks and valleys of a season in which individual glory didn't necessarily bring about team success, is also discussed.<br />Suchon also describes the challenges that Bonds faced during a season that must have sometimes seemed less than gracious, including a threat against his life, the actual death of a close personal friend, and a revision of perspective after September 11 (the post-tragedy hiatus also stymied the momentum he had built up beforehand).<br />Most treacherous of all is the disdainful manner in which Bonds was treated by opposing pitchers who often simply refused to pitch to him, regardless of the game setting.  Giants fans will long remember Houston Astros manager, Larry Dierker and his pitching staff skulking on the lowest end of the cowardice scale, and the TV camera shots of Barry's daughters holding signs pleading, \\"Please pitch to our Daddy\\".<br />The relationship that Barry developed with the fans is worth several psychological treatises on human nature.   Possibly the most unpopular ballplayer outside of the San Francisco Bay Area, Bonds has always been lustily booed when the Giants play on the road and when he chased McGwire's home run record last year, few fans were rooting for him to break it.<br />And yet - when Giants opponents refused to pitch to Bonds, the fans - ESPECIALLY the Houston Astros fans !!! - would boo their own team with at least equal fervor!  They might have been rooting for Barry's defeat but not at the expense of honor.  It's a curious and gratifying aspect of the baseball fan that his sense of fair play might actually outweigh his personal dislike for an individual player.<br />The book ends after Barry has signed a long-term contract to finish his career with the Giants.  And Suchon strikes out by failing to adequately analyze the motives of the star who has said that he wants a World Series ring more than anything else including money but who merely sold his services to the highest bidder.<br />Indeed, Bonds sold his services to an organization that devotes an extremely disproportionate share of its payroll to reward HIM and cannot or will not purchase the services of other stars that might help propel Bonds and his teammates into the show that Barry says he wants to perform in more than any other.<br />Moreover, under Dusty Baker, the Giants have become a moribund organization that lives and dies on Bonds's shoulders.<br />Under predecessor Roger Craig, the Giants were able to master the fine art of moving base runners and MANUFACTURING runs - when their sluggers couldn't overpower the opposition - and \\"stealing\\" wins with the hit-and-run, the sacrifice, and the squeeze play.  But under Dusty Baker, Giant stewardship has become an entirely personality-driven affair, in which managerial decisions are based on favoritism, not talent or ability to deliver.<br />And sound fundamental baseball is an ancient memory.   This is a team designed to win only if its sluggers produce every day (which even Bonds is not capable of doing) because its manager does not demand or coach excellence in baseball fundamentals.<br />Bonds must know all of these things and how they affect his championship dreams, but like the lady of  Kent (!!!!), he \\"went\\" anyway.  When analyzing Bonds's personality, the author fails to adequately expose  and account for this.  As a result,  notwithstanding his thrilling depiction of the most gracious season ever bestowed on a ballplayer by the baseball gods, Josh Suchon still misses some of the show.	2002-08-03

The 1958 San Francisco Giants induce nostalgia not only because this was the first San Francisco Giants team but because they preceded the multiple heartbreaks that have since caused Giants fans to age rapidly.<br />1958 was before the 1959 collapse, in which the Giants blew a 2-game lead over the Dodgers with a week remaining in the season.  It was before Willie McCovey's ninth-inning line drive in Game 7 of the 1962 World Series, smashed with the tying and winning runs on base, was snagged by New York Yankee second baseman Bobby Richardson.  It was before the five straight second-place finishes behind the Dodgers and the St. Louis Cardinals in the mid-1960's and before the 1987 flop to the Cardinals in the National League Championship Series after the Giants had taken a 3-2 game lead.  It was before the collapse of 1993, in which a 10-game lead over the Atlanta Braves was lost and before Dusty Baker's country club director-like \\"leadership\\" tranquilized the team into a ten-year sleepwalk.<br />The author, Bay Area sportscaster, Steve Bitker, brings us back to a year in which the Giants were new and different to the City, as fresh as a piping hot loaf of bread emerging from the Boudini Bakery overlooking Seals Stadium (players and fans could both enjoy this smell AND the smell of the hops from the nearby Hamms brewery).<br />The Giants were welcomed by all except for some diehard Seals fans, who mourned the necessary departure of their Pacific Coast League favorites.  A-MAYS-ingly enough, the schism between working-class baseball fans and the City's baseball-disdaining jet set, which was exposed during the \\"ballpark\\" elections in the 1980's, didn't exist in 1958, as art-lovers took their transistor radios and earplugs into the Opera House in order to simultaneously enjoy both Mozart's \\"Abduction from the Seraglio\\" and Willie's thefts of second base.<br />Bitker was able to find 36 surviving members from the 1958 team who consented to be interviewed for the book.  These included Manager Bill Rigney; everyday stars such as Mays, Orlando \\"Baby Bull\\" Cepeda and Felipe Alou; pitching aces such as Ruben Gomez, John Antonelli, and Stu Miller; \\"almost-weres\\" such as Leon Wagner (\\"Daddy Wags\\"); \\"once-weres\\" such as Whitey Lockman and Hank Sauer; \\"would- later-becomes\\" such as Bill White; \\"coulda-beens\\" such as Willie Kirkland, Valmy Thomas, and Andre Rogers; and \\"we-were-theres\\" such as Jackie Brandt and Don Taussig.<br />Bitker also provides an overview of the Giants' departure from declining attendance in New York and of the welcome that they received from the City.  He also gives a blow-by-blow account of a remarkable season in which a team, regarded by most analysts as both too young and too old to seriously compete, was in first place for much of the year.  It would finish impressively in third place behind the Milwaukee Braves and the Pittsburgh Pirates, but ahead of the rival Dodgers in the standings and would gloriously beat them 16 times (against 6 losses) in head-to-head competition (\\"WE MURDER THE BUMS\\", screamed the Chronicle headline, following Gomez's 8-0 victory over them on Opening Day).<br />But the hatred existing between the two teams starts to dissipate when they no longer share the same metropolitan area.  And 1958 was NOT a sign of things to come.  The Dodgers would enjoy greater success on the West Coast.  And they would leave the Coliseum for a beautiful ballpark at Chavez Ravine while the Giants would leave their beloved (by all except Antonelli) Seals Stadium for a cavernous wind tunnel at Candlestick Point.<br />Bitker provides information about the curious circumstances that led to the construction of what was commonly believed to be the worst ballpark in the majors, where the Giants roamed for 40 years before returning downtown in 2000 to Pac Bell Park.<br />But let it never be forgot that the 1958 upstarts evolved into the 1962 pennant winners that came within three feet of besting the mighty Yankees forthe world championship.  And Giants fans must learn this brutal truth:  it will never happen again.  Even after Dusty Baker is led to the glue factory, the Giants will never again come as close as they did 40 years ago.<br />Bitker's narrative shows why.  Say what you will about him, owner Horace Stoneham recognized the value of a productive farm system and invested heavily in the Giants` farm system.  It responded by producing young stars such as Mays, McCovey, Cepeda, the Alous, and Jim Davenport, all of whom played crucial roles in 1962.<br />With the advent of free agency, the formula today is often different.  But current Giants management is unable or unwilling to buy additional free agent superstars to complement Barry Bonds, while saddled with $170 million worth of debt service on their new privately financed ballpark.  A good farm system might ultimately produce low-salaried but high quality championship-caliber youngsters.  But there is a sense that Bay Area fans, more jaded than they were in 1958, will not support a youthful team experiencing growing pains for a few losing years while maturing into contenders.<br />So the Giants' strategy in the \\"Pac Bell\\" era has been to siphon off the cream of the farm system in exchange for aging, past-their-prime, low-maintenance veterans such as Eric Davis, Reggie Sanders and Shawon Dunston, in hopes of finding an occasional pearl (Ellis Burks) in the cracked oyster shells.  It's a strategy destined to produce a number of 85-90 win seasons  (fewer wins should be expected after the departure of the Great Barry) and zero championships.<br />The strategy is contrary to that which produced a near-champion in 1962, and Giants fans, like Sisyphus, must resign ourselves that for all eternity (or at least for another 15 years or so until the debt on the ballpark is paid off), the team is doomed to disappointment every time it arrives near the top of the mountain.<br />Until the end of eternity arrives, Giant fans can remaingrateful to Bitker for taking us back to 1958 when the world was young.	2002-07-07

He discusses the history of liberalism, starting with the early days, during which liberalism indeed represented advocacy of human liberty and ending with the post-New Deal era, in which liberalism has come to mean liberty for liberals only and servitude for everyone else.<br />The ugly double standards that liberals practice when distinguishing \\"us\\" from \\"them\\" are elaborated on, as is the liberal enshrinement of all allies on the left, including Communist dictators, no matter how dangerous or offensive, and demonization of all opponents on the right, no matter how inefficacious.  Political correctness and affirmative action are exposed here, even though these phrases have not yet become part of the American lexicon.<br />For while the themes are familiar, this book was written in an era that seems quite removed from that which we live in now - in the shadow of JFK's death and prior to Khrushchev's ouster and to the Tonkin Resolution which expanded America's role in Vietnam.  It was also written at a time when the unsuccessful Goldwater presidential campaign, which would spawn Ronald Reagan's successful one, had not yet taken shape.<br />The book therefore provides valuable historical perspective at the dawn of some of liberalism`s most significant influences, as well as the ascendancy of conservatism as an impotent political force.<br />Burnham doesn't score 100% on the \\"crystal ball\\" test.  His pessimism about the virtual invulnerability of communism and the need for American resolve to defeat it rings naïve today.  Since the end of World War II and the invention of the Bomb, Americans were probably always too fat, dumb and happy to be willing to die in large numbers to prevail over the Soviets, ever preferring to believe that freedom is free.  But Soviet communism turned out to have enough of its own fatal defects so as to render unnecessary the need for American resolve.<br />Nevertheless, in other respects, Burnham demonstrates impressive forethought in writing this volume.  His conclusion that contemporary liberalism, by nature, is incapable of governing or of using timely military force in appropriate amounts very much anticipates the Clinton and Carter administrations, even if Burnham can't quite anticipate the Clinton War Room or scandal-driven military strikes or any of the extraordinary acts of destruction that liberals would actually turn out to be willing to commit in order to acquire and maintain power for its own sake.<br />As Burnham is writing, some of the worst evils of liberalism haven't yet taken shape.  The liberals, especially RFK, haven't yet performed their cynical \\"about face\\" maneuver on Vietnam; They haven't yet completely poisoned American civilization with obscene, mindless, standard-less, witless, indulgent entertainment and pop-culture therapy, masquerading as empowerment, self-fulfillment, and individualist expression.  They haven't yet made infanticide a constitutional right.  They haven't yet led female and homosexual minions to war against the traditional heterosexual male ethos, nor have they secured their political future by unleashing on America's borders countless numbers of undocumented aliens to assault American civilization in the name of \\"multiculturalism\\".<br />Yet Burnham's relentless analysis lays bare the intellectual bankruptcy and moral shortcomings of even the 1964 class of liberals.  And the examples that he provides of liberal intellectuals savaging human lives in order to score ideological points anticipate the even more destructive childlike New Class of liberals that will arise later in his decade and rule into the 21st century.<br />But Burnham ultimately fails in the same way that other conservatives have been failing since his time.  He does not call for the eradication of liberalism.  Instead, he argues that a liberal spirit of innovation is desirable to enact needed social reforms and that conservatives are needed to govern them.  Unfortunately, this is a slippery slope that conservatives tend to fall into quite often - giving up the ghost of past battles by venerating liberal reforms and politicos that they rightfully assailed a generation earlier.<br />Witness the way in which America's most prominent conservative now tries to put a \\"compassionate\\" female-friendly multicultural face on conservatism - the better with which to \\"conserve\\" the evils already wrought.<br />\\"We don't want to repeal Title IX,\\" conservatives plead regarding a wicked law whose name and face belong on a \\"Wanted\\" poster.  \\"Title IX is GOOD!  We only want it enforced in accordance with its ORIGINAL INTENT.\\"  Oh my God!<br />Such actions cause conservatives to slide into hollows designed by liberal troglodytes, such as the late Herbert Block.  \\"Half a step, half a step,\\" a mocking Herblock once had Dwight Eisenhower plead Father Time in one cartoon.  \\"You keep marching too fast.\\"<br />And if the only function of conservatives is not to combat liberal reforms but only to manage or trim them, conservatism scarcely seems worth the trouble and expense of maintenance, and the Herblocks of the world are indeed entitled to a laugh at conservatives' expense, ridiculing them for always being a half step behind.<br />Nine years after National Review`s inception in 1955, Burnham has already tragically moved away from the publication's stated purpose of standing athwart history yelling \\"Stop\\", and he sets the stage for others to move even further away.  Neither he nor they understand that conservatism and its advocates will not be worth a damn until they obtain the will and the wherewithal to put Father Time in a headlock and march him firmly BACKWARD.tless analysis lays bare the intellectual bankruptcy and moral shortcomings of even the 1964 class of liberals.

The story  involves a series of murders of a number of saloon girls, but the murders are relatively bloodless.  There arent even any \\"rippings\\" for Jack to investigate.<br />Considering the victims and the time in which the novel is set, it makes sense that London's investigation would cause him to visit or consider a number of melodeons, dance halls, concert halls, beer dens, deadfalls, and even one brothel on the infamous Barbary Coast.<br />But really, all of the cheap sex - whether it's consummated or just hinted at - gets pretty dull, after a while.  I mean, if a novel were set in contemporary San Francisco, wouldn't it soon get rather boring if every other scene was set in a gay bathhouse?<br />Actually, while I would never read it, I have a feeling that such a novel has already been written and that it really is that tedious after the shock value wears off.  One would shake his head and say, \\"There must be more to contemporary San Francisco than places like this.\\"<br />Well, by the same token, there must be more to pre-earthquake San Francisco, even on the Barbary Coast, than the illicit non-thrills that the author, Peter King, shows us.<br />To be fair, there is one rollicking good chase-and-fight scene that takes place in the subterranean city underneath Chinatown, as well as a decent bare-knuckles boxing exhibition with former heavyweight champ John L. Lewis (ouch!).  But the surfeit of dance hall girls in revealing outfits dooms this novel.<br />The civilized personality of Jack London, as he is portrayed in this novel, is also disappointing.<br />As King notes, at this stage of his life, London has done time in the Erie State penitentiary where he fought empty-handed against a prisonerwith a broken table leg.  He has taken on five armed assailants at once, while with the California Fish Patrol.  He has risked the forbidding white hell that was the Chilcoot Pass in Alaska's Klondyke.<br />His personality should have a rawness that reflects this and other experiences.  Moreover, since London's socialism is alluded to as a motivation for his desire to bring justice to the downtrodden girls who died, he should have the passion of the reformer, but that's also missing.<br />It really does seem as though the author plays it too safe with his lead character.  Of course, an angry socialist detective likely would have antagonized a number of readers, but it might have made the novel more interesting if the detective was someone that the reader had mixed feelings about.<br />Besides, King could have juxtaposed London's socialism with his quest for gold in the Klondyke.  If London HAD stuck it rich in Alaska, after the hardship that he underwent and after his several brushes with death, no doubt he would have remained true to his socialist beliefs and dutifully donated his gold into some workers' collective.<br />The other famous personalities that Jack runs into who were known to have lived in or visited San Francisco or Northern California at this time, such as Rudyard Kipling, Ambrose Bierce, Oscar Wilde and Oscar Hammerstein don't save this novel, and neither does the climax at Half Moon Bay.<br />But the novel isn't a total loss, and I understand that there are already one or more sequels out there, and since both the setting and the principal character have promise, I intend to read the next one in the series.<br />San Francisco, tell me you're the heart of all the golden west in Peter King's next Jack London novel.  Instead of its genitalia.	2002-07-06
US	50691488	R1V8GAD2MGMNTK	0747255229	581204641	Jack the Ripper A to Z	Books	4	6	19	N	N	Worthwhile & informative,despite authors� funny little games	In his Foreword to this reference book, Donald Rumbelow states that \\"contrary to popular belief, the pre-occupation with the Ripper is not anti-feminist\\".<br />Oh, thank you for the sour persimmons, Donald Rumbelow.  Now all can revel in the mystery of Jack the Ripper with clear consciences and without having to worry about being affiliated with those horrible (chooey!) anti-feminists.<br />And your clarification was necessary because, as everyone knows, when we are not blowing up abortion clinics, anti-feminists are indeed in the habit of committing serial murders of women and ritualistically using their blood to brew our sacred malt liquor.<BR>Sheesh!<br />And Rumbelow also states that he has no doubt that the mystery will eventually be solved.  He wrote that in 1991 before the Maybrick Diary was publicized, but some of us think that the Maybrick Diary contains the solution to the mystery, and yet the debate rages on.<br />What would have to happen in order for the mystery to be solved to the satisfaction of MOST, let alone EVERYONE?  In the wake of the Maybrick storm, Rumbelow's prediction seems naïve today.<br />But notwithstanding the Forward, this is a very good reference work, usable for both novice and expert, for which the editors, Paul Begg, Martin Fido, and Keith Skinner deserve much credit.<br />They appear to have overlooked no detail of information or speculation or tradition associated with Jack the Ripper.  When one sees an entire entry devoted to \\"Smith, H - Undertaker of Hanbury Street, who supplied hearse for Annie Chapman\\", one must acknowledge that the editors truly appear to have left no stone unturned.<br />Maybe they went a little too far.  Does it advance the study of the Ripper mystery to list every fanciful movie or TV show based on that theme, including the Star Trek episode \\"Wolf in the Fold\\"?<br />The authors are modest enough about what they have done and do not vouch for 100% accuracy, but as corrections are brought to their attention, they appear to be dutifully acknowledged and included in each new edition of this book.<br />Where there are disputes, the authors usually present all sides well and  demonstrate impartiality in their analysis.  Usually.  I especially appreciate their presentation of the dispute over the \\"Lusk kidney\\" (genuine kidney removed from Ripper victim, Catherine Eddowes, or medical student hoax?)<br />But what's this - \\"(O)n the basis of handwriting analysis, there currently seems little doubt that Maybrick did not write the Journal\\"?  Uh - no.  Even the most stalwart Maybrickian might have to admit that the handwriting in the diary is a problem, but that remark from \\"A to Z\\" unacceptably crosses the boundary between impartial analysis and opinion.<br />And what of the famous \\"Dear Boss\\" letters written to the Central News Agency, which were signed \\"Jack the Ripper\\", from which the East End murderer acquired his legendary nickname?  If the letters were contemporary hoaxes and weren't written by the murderer, it isn't really accurate to refer to the murderer as \\"Jack the Ripper\\".<br />When the editors solemnly intone (correctly) that \\"most researchers\\" have concluded that the letters were indeed hoaxes, I am inclined to believe that they are slyly using the weight of majority opinion to browbeat the reader into agreeing.<br />Begg and Fido are certainly part of the \\"growing consensus\\" on this issue - do they ever advertise a willingness to go AGAINST the consensus?<br />And yet, among other things, the \\"Dear Boss\\" letters were taken seriously at the time by the police and were written by someone who appears to display the extreme cocksureness of the serial killer.  They were written by someone who seems to know that human blood thickens quickly and can't be saved for later use as ink.  And they were written by someone who seems POSITIVE that more murders are yet to come.  Moreover, they are written in the same hand as that which wrote a threatening letter to a police witness who might have seen the murderer - hardly the work of a hoaxing publicity hound.<br />So why the consensus AGAINST the authenticity of these letters?  Could it be that most Ripperologists have their own favorite suspects, who were unable or unlikely to have written the \\"Dear Boss\\" letters, and that these Ripperologists merely alter their view of the letters to conform to their own pre-drawn conclusions?<br />Begg and Fido wrote about the Ripper before publishing this reference work.  Each of them named a different poverty-stricken lunatic semi-literate Polish Jew as the most likely Ripper candidate.  Neither of their candidates could have written in the good copperplate hand that wrote the \\"Dear Boss\\" letters.  Are Begg and Fido expediently allowing their objectivity to be clouded by taking false reassurance from the opinion of \\"most researchers\\"?<br />Ripperologists are confident about issues such as this because of consensuses that they learn about by reading the works of Ripperologists.  Did the police operate this way?  No wonder Jack was never caught in his lifetime.<br />In their published commentary about Jack the Ripper, Begg, Fido, and Skinner have proven themselves to be of impartial disposition and advocates of fair treatment for all points of view.  They have shown themselves to be friends of the truth, whatever that truth may prove to be.  But I am reminded of a book on realpolitik that I once read, in which it was observed that a friend is someone that you can trust 80% of the time.<br />With that in mind, a rating of four stars out of a possible five seems quite appropriate.	2002-06-15
US	50691488	R1A58F7JWO2KN3	0393034690	219040303	Joe Morgan: A Life in Baseball	Books	4	4	5	N	N	A smoking line drive!	This relatively small volume is like its author.  It delivers a fierce line drive which splits the alley and rolls to the wall for extra bases.  One regards this book in the same way that he looks at the little guy sliding into second or third base afterwards and wonders, not for the first time, how he could have hit the ball so hard!<br />Joe Morgan's \\"A Life in Baseball\\" is the story of an intensely driven individual who overcame the twin handicaps of race and small physical stature to become a Hall of Fame second baseman and a crucial component of one of baseball's most famous dynasties.<br />Morgan's dedication rings forcefully in each word of this volume, and so do the same affability and sense of humor that he displays in the broadcast booth.  Yet he never forgets that baseball, like most other endeavors, is a team sport, and that sacrifice of time, effort, and personal aggrandizement is necessary for the good of the team.  The Big Red Machine not only required the talent of players like Morgan but their attitude as well.  This is a man willing and eager to share what he has with others.<br />As described by Morgan, the smallness of other baseball men such as Harry Walker and Bill Virdon - in moral, if not in physical stature - stands out in stark contrast.  Walker was an original Brooklyn Dodger who harassed his teammate, Jackie Robinson, and the revelations about his stewardship of the Houston Astros shouldn't surprise anyone.  It's startling to realize that the trade that sent Morgan, Jack Billingham, and Cesar Geronimo to the Cincinnati Reds and engendered the Big Red Machine was largely driven by Walker's grudge against Morgan.<br />Virdon's fatal flaw was ego-driven, not race-driven, but Astro fans who wonder why their team has not reached the World Series in 40 years of existence will weep over Morgan's description of Virdon's actions during the deciding game of the 1980 championship series against the Phillies.<br />On the West Coast, Morgan, a Bay Area native, is best known (with reverence or with acrimony) for providing San Francisco Giant fans with bittersweet vengeance by knocking the Los Angeles Dodgers out of the pennant race with that three-run homer that he hit on the last day of the 1982 season off of the Dodger's Terry Forster. This was while Morgan was playing for the Giants in the twilight of his career.  The Atlanta Braves, who were playing the San Diego Padres on that final day, were the ultimate division-winning beneficiaries.  Alas, this book doesn't dwell enough on that historic moment.<br />But following that event, Morgan (who once almost signed with the Dodgers as a free agent) has found himself denying that he is a Dodger-hater.  He should know better.  It's not just Giant fans but everyone who is not a Dodger fan that is a Dodger-hater.  The Padres were uprightly playing \\"spoiler\\" to the Braves by beating them, but after Morgan's home run ultimately stood up as a game-winner over the Dodgers and settled the issue, the TV cameras showed the Braves and the Padres interrupting their contest to celebrate together.  Come on, Joe; admit it.  You enjoyed the taste of Dodger Blue blood in your mouth as much as anyone.<br />Morgan is able to describe baseball's racial problems forcefully but without rancor.  This book was published in 1993, and is partly outdated.  He remarks that black managers are under more pressure to win than white managers.  Perhaps this was true at the time, but the current ubiquitousness of black non-winners such as Dusty Baker and Don Baylor suggests that, slowly but surely, blacks are being given the same opportunity that Gene Mauch always had to fulfill the Peter Principle by rising to their level of mediocrity.<br />Morgan refers to the infamous Al Campanis remarks as evidence of a larger problem without acknowledging that Campanis's remarks were not so dissimilar from those that Morgan and other black ballplayers made in a magazine article.  The context of Campanis's remarks was somewhat different but hardly enough to justify banishing him from the game like a pariah after a half century of Morgan-like dedication to it.  Morgan would have done better to reflect on the injustice, and he should realize that dialogue can't take place if one party is going to be penalized for frankness and knows that at the outset.<br />And Morgan's complaints about the corrupting effect of money on the game are accurate but not so prescient, having been made on the eve of the 1994 work stoppage that cost America the World Series.  And they have to be regarded in light of his own actions.  Morgan and Tim McCarver are two of the best baseball minds around today.  Are either of them willing to step down from their broadcast positions and accept a lower six-figure income as baseball managers or as intermediaries/roving ambassadors of the type that Morgan suggests in his book?  <br />However, it appears as though Morgan's suggestion has since been adopted since that is essentially the role that Tom Lasorda and others have been playing.<br />Finally, I can only give Morgan a mediocre grade for his discussion of the \\"Pete Rose\\" issue.  Yes, Pete was probably guilty of betting on baseball, Morgan says.  Yes, he lied about it.  Yes, Pete has failed to address his actions with the requisite humility and penitence, wrongly regarding his banishment from baseball as another tough fastball to be hit; another catcher to be ploughed through.

US	50691488	R34QXL5A3EWUI	0942627512	89238037	The Grand Minor League: An Oral History of the Old Pacific Coast League	Books	5	15	17	N	N	REAL baseball giants and the mysterious Mr. Lindell	Dick Dobbins does the job right in \\"The Grand Minor League\\", a retrospective of the old Pacific Coast League (PCL).<br />The PCL still exists today as a AAA league - one step below the majors - but it is purely an adjunct minor league system to the two major leagues.<br />However, this book is about the PCL's glory days, largely originating during the Depression and spanning the second world war and the first twelve years of the post-war era until the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Dodgers moved to the West Coast.<br />The PCL financed operations by charging admission for its own games and by selling contracts of its more promising stars to the established major league teams.  But some visionaries had dreams of attaining major league status for the PCL, and it could have happened.  A disproportionate amount of major-league level talent could be found on the West Coast, and PCL scouts were busy signing it up.<br />While one PCL owner was dryly reputed to have the reputation of throwing dollars around as though they were manhole covers, the pay could be more generous (the players whose contracts were sold to the majors even received a percentage of the sales price) and the opportunities for stardom could be GREATER than that which was available in the majors; moreover, the Pacific Coast was \\"home\\" to many of its players.  Hence, some major leaguers sought to return there.<br />And when the majors reluctantly granted the PCL \\"open classification\\" status, players drafted by the majors were accorded the option of waiving the draft and remaining with their respective PCL teams and were often rewarded with bonuses for doing so.  The PCL could have evolved into a third major league, but the opposition from the established major league owners, who saw the potential for expansion or relocation to the West Coast long before moving the Giants and Dodgers there, was too great to overcome.  The moves themselves sounded the death knell for the traditional conception of the league.<br />Its legacy includes the players who became stars or near-stars in the big leagues, such as Lefty O'Doul, Dolph Camilli, Maury Wills (amazingly enough, he was only an adequate shortstop and a sometime base-stealer during his PCL days, who didn`t reach stardom until he went to the Dodgers), and of course, Joe DiMaggio.<br />Startlingly, Dobbins fails to remind his readers that years before he electrified the country with his 56-game hitting streak, DiMaggio was thrilling West Coast fans with a 61 game hitting streak in the PCL.  Both records are among the few that have withstood the test of time.<br />One can observe other ironies.  Long before Tommy Lasorda and Sparky Anderson did battle, in their respective roles as managers of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Cincinnati's \\"Big Red Machine\\", for Western Division supremacy during the 1970's, they were teammates on the Los Angeles Angels, working together to establish geographical supremacy against the arch-rival Hollywood Stars.<br />And speaking of managers, debate rages among baseball historians about Casey Stengel's managerial acumen.  Was he an adept, if incomprehensible, managerial genius or a bum who failed miserably in Boston and who only attained success by piggy-backing on the vast talent of some super Yankee teams?  The story of Stengel's stewardship of the 1948 PCL Champion Oakland Oaks is a huge point in his favor.<br />Dobbins draws some of his history from the records but most of it from the recollections of the old-time players who consented to be interviewed.  My only real criticism is that it took someone too long to undertake this project.  The passage of time limits the sources from which Dobbins could draw.<br />And how trustworthy is human memory?  There is a reference in one of the narratives supplied to Dobbins about a player named Johnny Lindell who alternated between pitcher and outfielder and who \\"would have been in the big leagues\\" if he could have only hit more consistently.<br />Who would dare observe, in response, that the record book shows that during the 1940's, an outfielder-pitcher named Johnny Lindell played in the majors, chiefly for the Yankees (this included several World Series appearances), on a part-time basis for 12 years and that he retired in 1954 with a respectable lifetime batting average of .273, having twice led the league in triples?<br />He couldn't hit well enough for the major leagues.  Or could he?  Were there two Johnny Lindells answering to the same description?  <br />My favorite chapter was about the old ballparks.  If you are a displaced and discouraged Giant fan who lives in the Los Angeles area, you can carry the book and its pictures of the ballparks to the corners of Beverly, Fairfax and Genessee and try to envision the Hollywood Stars' Gilmore Field having once stood there.  The intersections now are home to a little company known as CBS - Television City, and there isn't even a marker anywhere to show that Gilmore Field ever existed.<br />And you can drive to 42nd and Avalon and marvel at the human and urban sprawl that has overtaken the area.  Wrigley Field, home to the ORIGINAL Los Angeles Angels and named and constructed after its more famous Chicago namesake, has been torn down, and a community center named after a politician has been erected in its place.  Again, no marker commemorates Wrigley Field.  Soccer, not baseball, is the recreation of choice for the locals, and the excited cries of the players and spectators are not being delivered in English.<br />Is there any marker on the corner of 16th and Bryant in San Francisco to memorialize Seals Stadium?<br />\\"The Grand Minor League\\" is a fitting tribute to the REAL baseball giants of the West Coast and to a time when baseball was a \\"melting pot\\" language, when the game was played, not by overpaid egotistical prima donnas, but by men with working-class ethics, and when teams were managed by men and not \\"Dustys\\".

US	50691488	R3OG9OFJWMP8L9	0451196716	882393531	The Long Walk	Books	5	5	8	N	N	Warning!  No. 1, Stephen King!  A 5-star warning!	I'm not a huge Stephen King fan, but some of his books and short stories are pretty good, and I truly loved this novel and regard it as his best.<br />King would no doubt be amazed to hear that anyone regards \\"The Long Walk\\" as his \\"best\\" book; it's one of his earlier books, written in the \\"Carrie\\" era when John Travolta was king of pop, and it was originally a \\"Bachman\\" novel - that is, written when, for experimental purposes, King hid his light under the bushel of a less famous pseudonym.<br />Well, his later novels might have a more mature \\"style\\" and might flow easier, but the pace of this one is more tense and the characters are remarkably likable.  And I'm amazed at how much confusion there is about what happens at the end.  Reasonably intelligent people giving the ending an adequate amount of thought should have little trouble figuring it out.<br />Set in a futuristic era, ruled by a military dictatorship personified by \\"The Major\\", the story is about 100 boys of high-school age who set off on a \\"Long Walk\\" which requires them to maintain a pace of 4 miles an hour, come steep hills, hell, or high water.  Anyone who has walked a treadmill knows that this is quite a brisk walking pace.  The ostensible goal is \\"The Prize\\" - everything that you want for the rest of your life.<br />When a Walker drops below 4 miles an hour, he gets a warning.  Three warnings are all that a Walker will get, though an hour without a warning enables the Walker to get rid of one warning.  If a Walker slows down below 4 miles an hour while he's walking with three warnings, he's eliminated from the race.  With extreme prejudice.  By soldiers in a half-track armed with rifles.  The winner is determined after 99 Walkers have been eliminated.<br />Although this is both an early novel and a Bachman experiment, it's still vintage King - a macabre walk of death taking place in a recognizable middle-class setting.<br />So King makes the occasion as festive as positive, adding his normal helping of cheerleaders, gym squads, Cub Scouts, Little League players, Italian fruit merchants, Grant Wood families, civic clubs, and automobile salesmen to the mix of spectators that cheer on the Long Walkers and roar at the crack of the rifles - as usual, this is King's way of accentuating the horror that he has created by \\"mainstreaming\\" it.<br />Still, speaking as one who utterly despises endurance athletes, I see tremendous possibilities in this idea.  If one could find a way to eliminate the lion's share of many thousands of real-world smug cliquish androgynous leisure-class weekend warriors that clog up metropolitan areas with their self-loving marathon fests and who clog up their other environs during the remainder of the week, what a finer, happier world we would live in!<br />But the graphically-portrayed deaths of these boys aren't enjoyable at all.  They are both pointless and heroically tragic.  Even while making the Walkers very recognizably and coarsely adolescent, King is also able to make them quite endearing in their own way, much more endearing than the yuppie scum who participate in real-life marathons.  As did other readers, I also enjoyed the camaraderie among the Walkers, made especially poignant by the knowledge that they had no hope of meeting again after the conclusion of the Walk.<br />King's \\"message\\" is somewhat garbled by the curious \\"game show\\" quotations that precede most chapters, but it becomes clearer when a later chapter instead begins with a radio announcer's call from the second Cassius Clay/Sonny Liston fight:  \\"The blood has begun to flow...Clay is killing him...Clay is killing him...Oh, ladies and gentlemen, I don't know how to describe this scene.\\"<br />Clearly, King means for this novel to be a \\"statement\\" against the violence of sports culture.  It's a typical left-wing bogeyman, as is the right-wing military dictatorship that organizes \\"The Long Walk\\" as both ritual and money-maker.  In real life, the intellectualoids who govern us would never tolerate the rule of a military that they hadn't already taken over, as far back as the McNamara era.<br />And as athletes become wealthier and more yuppified, violence in professional sports has become less, not more prevalent, Mike Tyson notwithstanding.  There is scarcely a millionaire sportsman today who would ever do anything as gauche as engage in open warfare for the good of the team.<br />And while King agonizes over the \\"culture of violence\\", in the real world, young boys are severely disciplined for even having violent fantasies, such as bringing cap pistols onto school grounds or pointing an index finger at a rival and yelling \\"bang\\".<br />Is the stench of violent death that pervades the world of \\"The Long Walk\\" any worse than the stench of antiseptic that pervades our own?  And for all of the horror of the fictitious world that he created in \\"The Long Walk\\", is Stephen King aware of how relatively ATTRACTIVE it also is?<br />He's on the right track when he describes the Major's presence as \\"very masculine and overpowering\\".  The world of the Long Walk is all that and it is also scrupulously fair - both in the un-coerced manner in which Walkers participate and in the way that the rules of the Walk are disclosed beforehand and enforced honestly during the Walk itself.<br />\\"The Long Walk\\" is an excellent story which attacks largely non-existent targets, a story about a world not as nightmarish as the author intended, but considerably more alluring.<br />In another setting, Stephen King himself has repeated the maxim that \\"it is the tale, not he who tells it.\\"  He doesn't know how right he is here.<br />I'm giving King 5 stars for this novel, but I'm also ordering him to re-read the 1948 Ray Bradbury short story, \\"Pillar of Fire\\", for a more accurate view of what the future looks like now.	2002-06-08

Aren't you starting to shamefacedly regard yourself as no better than those monstrous assailants?<br />Think that the welfare is counterproductive?  That it might actually hurt those that it is supposed to help?  By perpetuating a cycle of poverty?<br />Pish-posh.  Caleb Carr will take you on a tour of the worst slum in old New York.

That for all its faults, it might, in some ways, be a repository for the accumulated wisdom of the ages?<br />How dare you?  How DARE you?  You just hush up your mouth and sit down and read Caleb Carr's \\"The Alienist\\", which is a different type of historical novel, and you will learn that the past is to be unreservedly and unqualifiedly LOATHED!  <br />And once you've learned THAT lesson, why, that should make it easier for the author to \\"sell\\" his vision of what the FUTURE should be.<br />Oh yeah, there's a murder mystery in there.  Somewhere.  Something about a bunch of corpses showing up around New York City with their eyes gouged out.  Or something.<br />And a chief of police who's - uh - going to be President someday.<br />And  - uh - I think there's a psychologist in there who engages in what we moderners would call the \\"profiling\\" of criminals, but again, this story takes place in the PAST (chooey!) so they call him an \\"alienist\\".<br />You say you want a revolution?  You'll have to settle for a narrative, DISGUISED as a murder mystery, in which 1960's New Left philosophy is superimposed onto an 1896 setting like ketchup on ice cream.  If a \\"journalist\\" from an underground newspaper or maybe one of those free \\"throwaway\\" papers that are distributed in large metropolitan areas sought to write a murder mystery, \\"The Alienist\\" is pretty much what it would read like.<br />And if you doubt that, look at the photo on the back cover of the book.

US	50691488	R2260TFM519UZD	0836204387	667860921	Calvin & Hobbes Books, Tenth Anniversary Book	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Tiger, tiger - forever burning bright	No doubt it would be redundant to repeat that \\"Calvin & Hobbes\\" was the greatest comic strip ever written.  Even though it was.<br />I miss the strip terribly and wish as much as anyone that Bill Watterson would come out of hibernation after almost seven years to crank up new adventures for his philosopher toonheads.  I even partly believe that Watterson let down his readers by \\"quitting\\" on us.<br />At the same time, one of the reasons that we miss the strip so much is that it didn't lose its freshness after ten years.  Compare that to other well-known strips which lasted FOREVER, i.e. \\"Peanuts\\" and \\"Dennis the Menace\\", and which we ultimately turned to out of habit, rather than anticipation.  And how much longer can Jim Davis continue to run with that gluttonous, self-centered cat?<br />Watterson left us wanting more and perhaps it was better thus.  Moreover, his artistic integrity was such that he resisted what must have been a HUGE financial temptation to allow his characters to be licensed for merchandising (those auto decals that show Calvin watering the lawn from beneath his waist are \\"bootlegs\\").  This also prevented over-exposure.<br />This book is easily the best of all \\"collections\\" because it's a cumulation of highlights from the strip from beginning to end, interspersed with Watterson's commentary about the art of cartooning, the practical issues that arise when artistic license clashes with syndicate control, his own life experi-ences, and how they affect his work.<br />Watterson was not afraid to take on issues, and his favorite one appears to have been \\"television\\".  Biting attacks on the medium were as much a staple of  \\"Calvin & Hobbes\\" as attacks on \\"the Church\\" were of the Monty Python troupe.<br />And why not?  The more bloated, the more all-powerful, the more arrogant, lethargic and unchanging an institution appears, the more inviting a target it is for comedy.  It still takes wit, timing, and incisiveness to do the job right, and Watterson was never found lacking.  I still scream over the strip where Calvin, in humble supplication, presents as an \\"offering\\" to his TV set a bowl of lukewarm tapioca pudding representing his brain.<br />For all his audacity and integrity, however, Watterson still occasionally runs afoul of that old devil, political correctness.  As he runs through his list of characters, he is COMPLETELY UNCRITI-CAL when, chirping brightly, he describes Susie Derkins as earnest, serious, and smart - the kind of girl that he eventually married.<br />Susie is indeed everything that Watterson says and more so.  If the destructive Calvin is \\"Everyboy\\", Susie is \\"Everygirl\\" - OVERLY earnest, serious, and smart - a conformist to an educational system that we hated as kids.  In \\"1984\\", Orwell postulates that women are the keepers of all of the State's smelly little orthodoxies, and Susie's repeated whining invocations to the school authorities suggest that she's starting early.<br />It's why we don't really mind Calvin's seemingly unprovoked snowball and water balloon attacks on her, even though as the skulking aggressor, he is unquestionably  being cast as the \\"bad guy\\".<br />We can be certain that, on an artistic level, Watterson is well aware of ALL of these things.  But in this book, he goes out of his way to avoid saying them.  It's a testament to the power of political correctness and also to the truth of the bromide that the tale often speaks more loudly than the author.<br />But sometimes the author speaks louder.  The Sunday supplement in which Calvin envisions himself as a vengeful god, creating worlds so as to have the savage pleasure of destroying them, seems to \\"work\\" very well from the reader's standpoint, but Watterson's complaint that what he had intended was completely ruined by the format restrictions provides a good snapshot of the artist's mind at work.<br />Elsewhere, Watterson's careful selection of features and his commentary show us how the strip \\"grew\\" over the years as the characters became more familiar to him.<br />The artistry unquestionably became better, and the early strips show Calvin behaving in ways that are now inconceivably \\"wrong\\" - perhaps again, even more so that Watterson realizes.  The 1980's Calvin agonizes over the untimely death of a little raccoon.  He could not possibly be the same individual as the 1990's Calvin who tries to win a contest to promote highway safety by creating the slogan \\"Be careful or be road kill\\" and drawing a corresponding poster in cadmium red crayon and chunky spaghetti sauce.<br />He's also not nearly as funny.  Sometimes, those moral tutorials just got in the way of the humor, Bill.<br />Watterson also scores when he remarks that the issue of whether the tiger, Hobbes, was \\"real\\" or not didn't matter to him and that he went out of his way to avoid resolving the issue.  Too many readers are fooled by the stuffed animal that everyone else in Calvin's world saw, and they assume that the animated Hobbes was \\"obviously\\" a product of Calvin's imagination.<br />But Hobbes seemed to have a moral compass utterly lacking in Calvin, and think of the numerous times in which Hobbes surprised and disappointed Calvin.  If Hobbes was truly nothing more than Calvin's alter-ego, Calvin must have been utterly schizophrenic.  Was it really a \\"toy\\" tiger who was able to bind and gag Calvin?  And to enable Calvin to climb on his back to open a mailbox?<br />The mad confusion between \\"real\\" and \\"imaginary\\" matched perfectly with the mayhem engendered by the first-named title character (who did a little better job of standing up to the powers-that-be than does his creator) and with every bumpy wagon ride through the ravine and down the cliff that he and the tiger ever took.<br />As long as people remember this strip, there will always be hope that the rebellious \\"little boy\\" in us will ultimately prevail over the Ritalin-like conformity that others would impose.<br />Get out the time-fracture wickets, Hobbes!  It's Calvinball forever!he characters became more familiar to him.<br />The artistry unquestionably became better, and the early strips show Calvin behaving in ways that are now inconceivably \\"wrong\\" - perhaps again, even more so that Watterson realizes.

Why do they bash men so readily?  Well, why do wolves have sharp teeth?  The better to eat you with, of course.<br />Conversely, why do women untruthfully DENY that they are feminists or male-bashers?  For the same reason that the wolf doesn't show his teeth.  It might frighten away one's quarry.<br />There's just no mystery about female motivation for the war on men and surely no need for an explanatory book.<br />But why do many MEN become feminists and self-bashers?  What makes men, large numbers of them, adopt a philosophy of shame and self-hate?  Why do men follow the women in their lives to that evolutionary blind alley?<br />That is TRULY a mystery which I hoped that Howard Schwartz's \\"Revolt of the Primitive\\" would answer.<br />Schwartz's analysis, as others have noted, is primarily a Freudian one, to which he adds his own flourish.<br />He postulates that men go into the outside world and seek to tame it in order to impress women and concurrently as a means of making it more closely resemble the world of the primordial mother that they long for (and that girls and women are more easily linked to).<br />He further suggests that as women enter the work force and other institutions outside the home in large numbers, they see these differently from the men who understand the hardship and seeks to gain the respect of the women by engaging in it for their sake.   <br />Women see these institutions from the point of view of the primordial mother herself, who unrealistically expects the world of work to resemble her own primarily maternal sphere, a sphere \\"where the expression of her nurturing power could be given its freest expression\\".<br />As Schwartz explains, women treat the revelation that the outside world isn't truly like that, not with a concession to reality, but with hostility towards the men who inhabit it, rejecting any notion of gratitude for the sacrifices made by men within that world.  Rather, women blame men for the world's flaws.<br />And here we come to what Schwartz would view as the answer to the riddle of male feminism.  Men respond to the rejection of women not with remonstrations for their ingratitude but with fearful acquiescence to the female view.  To do otherwise would be to incur the wrath of the primordial mother.<br />As Schwartz describes, \\"He must therefore...follow her lead, not move from her project, never question her claim that were it not for the father, her life...would have been perfect.  In all of this, he relinquishes any possibility he has of an emotional life as a competent male adult, substituting instead the idea that male adulthood is the root of his problem.\\"<br />The male feminist as the eternally childlike naif - I like it.  This is the triumph of the revolt of the primitive - the conquest of the primordial mother.<br />Schwartz specifically looks at several issues through the prism of this analysis:  martial dissolutions and domestic violence (in both of them, actual male guilt is routinely overstated and female guilt understated), workplace conditions (the myths of the \\"pay gap\\" and the \\"glass ceiling\\"), political correctness on campus, and women in combat.<br />Schwartz is on the right track when he talks about the dictatorial reign of political correctness on campus.  The substitution of feelings and group-think for rigorous academic critique does indeed smack of a triumph of the feminine (the primordial mother, if you will) over the masculine, even as female students pile up a super-numerical advantages on campus.<br />And the feminist assault on the military taking place under the Tailhook banner - of course, it's a thinly-veiled assault on male sexuality.  To recognize that, one would not even need to be familiar with the specific examples that Schwartz provides.<br />But Schwartz's analysis isn't quite complete.  Male self-hatred today is toxic, absolutely toxic.  Anyone who surfs Usenet can see that men have not only accepted as true the charge that they are oppressors (which ready acceptance might be accounted for by Schwartz's analysis) but also, as true, the charge that they are actually inferior to women.<br />Men have, by and large, accepted all of the ugly descriptions that feminazi junk science imposes on them:  weak-kneed sissies incapable of giving birth and therefore incapable of dealing with pain and stress (though, as Schwartz shows, it's WOMEN who refuse to accept the world as it is), Y-chromosome mutants who are subject to genetic disease and early death.  The \\"weaker sex\\".  And so on.<br />Schwartz's \\"revolt of the primitive\\" might explain a certain measure of weary male passivity and acquiescence in the face of the female onslaught.  But it seems horribly inadequate as an explanation for sexual suicide and for intense and widespread male self-hatred.<br />Then too, Schwartz's description of the world would have us believe that with the triumph of the primordial mother, the feminine is in ascendance and the masculine is in retreat.<br />But the masculine ISN'T in retreat, not at all.  Our popular culture is littered with karate-kicking, groin-stomping men inhabiting the bodies of women such as Jennifer Lopez.  Snarling, tight-lipped, soccer playing \\"role models\\" Mia Hamm and Brandi Chastain preach \\"fierceness\\" as a standard for little girls to emulate.  Hairy-lipped small-breasted women put on their gym pants and actually run marathons and triathlons, but only when they're not practicing their boxing moves.<br />The masculine isn't in retreat but the purveyors of culture honor it ONLY when it finds expression in the actions of WOMEN.<br />It's really not the feminine that's in ascendance, of course; it's androgyny.  Our cultural gurus are busy turning men into women and women into men and it's ANDROGYNY, no less than the primordial mother, which represents the real horror.  I find nothing in Schwartz's book to account forthis development.<br />Your patient is dying, doctor.  You need to recognize ALL of the symptoms before your diagnosis can be completed.	2002-05-27

A novel centered around a 7 year-old boy, Luke Chandler, growing up on a cotton farm in 1952 rural Arkansas in an extended family (parents, grandparents, one cousin in Korea, even the hillbilly and Mexican farm workers sometimes serving as family surrogates), a novel in which this family battles the elements (natural and economic) on an everyday basis and in which having a \\"painted house\\" is the feature that most readily distinguishes the comfortable from the struggling, a novel in which the special weekly event is the Saturday afternoon bath (!!!) and the trip into town for the matinee - such a novel has to have a lot of good things going for it.<br />Especially when baseball is a recurrent theme.  There's a sandlot game that figures into the story and a picnic that features the annual game between the Baptists and the Methodists.<br />But nothing brings to the reader the sights and sounds of rural America in the Truman/Eisenhower era more readily than a big old-fashioned radio tuned into KMOX on a summer evening and the raspy voice of Harry Carey (announcing for the Cardinals and not the Cubs!!!) drowning out the sound of the crickets chirping in the hollers and the box fan whirring in the living room as he dramatically announces the approach of the great Stan Musial to home plate before a cheering crowd at Sportsman's Park.<br />The author, John Grisham, himself is no mean painter, and there is something quite elegant about his use of the radio to connect the Chandlers not only to baseball but to Edward Murrow and rest of the outside world, particularly the war in Korea where Luke's cousin is stationed.<br />Luke has never even been so far from Black Oak, Arkansas as to have seen a Cardinal game.  But the radio enables him to use his imagination to \\"see\\" every dimension of Sportsman's Park; to \\"see\\" the ball explode off of Musial's bat and bounce off of the right field wall, and to \\"watch\\" Musial slide into third base with a triple.<br />\\"I could see him get to his feet as the crowd went nuts,\\" Luke reports.  \\"Then with both hands, he slapped the dirt off his white uniform with the bright red trim.\\"<br />Of course, as Luke \\"sees\\" this on the radio, the reader \\"sees\\" it too.   I'm sure there's a literary term for the device that describes how Grisham makes both his literary creation and the reader concurrently use their respective imaginations, and I only wish that I knew what this term was.<br />Grisham does an excellent job of drawing the reader into this world.  You can see the endless rows of cotton that make up the Chandler farm; you can feel the rain that threatens to bring the flood that will wipe out virtually an entire harvest and the back-breaking effort that went into growing it.  You can hear the drone of the hard-shell Baptist preacher scolding his parishioners for a host of sins, real and imagined, and squirm uncomfortably at his tirade in the heavy air of a summer afternoon.  You can taste the fried chicken and ice cream at the picnic preceding the Baptist/Methodist baseball game, though I'm at a loss to understand why the players are eating that huge meal BEFORE the game.<br />However, the main theme of the novel are the moral dilemmas that engage Luke as he learns a number of secrets of life-or-death importance which the dictates of conventional morality would have him disclose.  Offset against this are the dire consequences that would result to his family if Luke followed those dictates.<br />Yet while Luke and his family are engaging, if taciturn, characters, Luke's dilemmas never quite piqued my interest as much as did his surroundings.<br />I might be unfairly comparing this novel to Grisham's \\"The Firm\\".<br />I don't remember \\"The Firm\\" having such colorful imagery, but its relentless pace, underlied by the  pace at which the young attorney sacrifices himself for the firm, shows  how he is inexorably being bound by its insatiable demands and hints at a revelation that will spark the novel's climax.<br />The bucolic summertime tempo of \\"Painted House\\" is not so taut, and no such revelations are promised or delivered.  The struggle for survival that challenges Luke's family at the beginning of the novel is not fundamentally different from that which occupies them at the end.<br />For a prepubescent ball hawk, Luke seems far more interested in the opposite sex than he has a right to be.  How can he possess both a 7 year-old's naïve certainty that future stardom with the St. Louis Cardinals will liberate him from farm life and a 17 year-old's interest in long brown legs?<br />Modernity has poked its nose into Black Oak by the novel's end.  Farmers are picking up and heading for the assembly lines of Detroit.  A television set actually makes its way into one resident's home, and Luke, like millions of real-life contemporaries, is awed by the fact that he can REALLY see the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Yankees in the World Series.<br />But I'm inclined to think that our worldly-wise youngster should display some brief foreboding that this wonderful new device deprives him of the ability to use his imagination to \\"see\\" the game on the radio.<br />If one could insert oneself into the text of this novel, would it be fair to tell Luke that he has another 12 years to wait until his beloved Cardinals make it into the Series?  That this new brightly-lit oracle will create a breed of athletes and executives corrupted by the almighty dollar?  And a generation of chicken-hearted pitchers unwilling to manfully challenge the Stan Musials of their era - hello, Barry Bonds - to display their talents?  To say nothing of the other evils that the post-war era has in store for American society in general?  And for the state of Arkansas in particular?<br />4 stars are gladly awarded to John Grisham for this contribution.	2002-05-08

The title is completely misleading.<br />This is NOT a book that you want to waste time reading if - uh - well, if you have a purely theoretical interest in how you would go about getting even with someone without going to jail.<br />My edition has, on its cover, not only the misleading title, but a cartoon of a man in prison stripes sitting on a bunk with the standard crossed red-circle (signifying \\"No\\") drawn through him, and I have no idea what this cartoon is doing here.<br />This book is pretty much a partial story of the life of a man, the author Maxx Robinson, born in 1915 and some of the grifter-like scams that he used in order to get an honorable discharge from the military and to make a buck as an entrepreneur.<br />I could hardly care less, and I should really give this book only one star for being something completely different from what was promised.<br />I'll throw out another star because, for a short time, it held a modicum of interest for me.  Robinson has some interesting stories about life in the Depression and during Prohibition and of his own World War II experiences, though none of the latter involved combat.<br />Also, there's some interesting tidbits here about life in Southern California during the post-war land boom.  I pretty much lost interest in the book after that, and so will the average reader unless he has a burning passion to acquire as much information as possible on how to build and operate a sawmill.<br />I AM mildly grateful for the author's honesty, and there is no reason to doubt that honesty.  His schemes won't upset the average reader, but he also has a frank portrayal of how he engaged in a racially-motivated and otherwise unprovoked attack on a zoot-suited Mexican on the streets of Anaheim following the post-victory celebration of the war's end.<br />The book should operate as a good antidote to Brokaw-induced nostalgia about the graciousness of the Depression/WW2 generation and the selfless patriotic service that the people of that generation rendered to the nation.<br />Yeah, yeah, yeah - but even setting aside the racial animus which was a dark side sometimes shown by that generation, it's pretty clear from Robinson's descriptions of his own corner-cutting schemes, and the settings in which they took place, that these schemes were not isolated incidents from this era but were simply his own renditions of what many people were doing at this time to get ahead or stay ahead.<br />Robinson provides little evidence of the existence of a generation of Good Samaritans who set aside all self-interest and internal differences and put their common shoulders to the wheel in order to pull the nation out of crisis.<br />I still think that we are living in the worst of times today, but it's clear from Robinson's account that the Depression/WW2 generation was not THAT much different from succeeding generations in terms of self-centeredness and moral shortcomings.<br />And for that admission, I suppose that the reader owes Robinson some gratitude.  In tribute to this, I have given him the extra star, and I'll even refrain from seeking revenge for having received something other than what I thought I was paying for.	2002-05-01
US	50691488	R22WSCANJ64B5E	0897332970	46733611	Trial Of Levi Weeks The	Books	4	5	5	N	Y	Somewhat dry but very professional and informative treatment	Notwithstanding the remarks from Publishers Weekly that the trial moved too slowly and the witnesses rambled too much for this story to be of interest to any but true-crime buffs, it is actually quite remarkable that there isn't more interest today in the saga of Levi Weeks and the mysterious death of his lover, Gulielma Sands.<br />That these incidents took place long ago (the turn of the 19th century) shouldn't matter - people are still debating the 15th century death of the Princes in the Tower of London.<br />The story of the death of Gulielma Sands and of Levi Weeks's trial has a quaint touch of old New York about it, occurring at a time when farm animals were routinely transported up and down Broadway, not long after the charter that led to the formation of the New York Stock Exchange was entered into under a peach tree on Wall Street.<br />The circumstances of Miss Sands's death were quite mysterious; the testimony of the witnesses is quite dramatic at times (however much it might sometimes have rambled), and Levi Weeks himself was represented by two of the most prominent attorneys in the state of New York - none other than Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr (obviously before the ill-fated duel).<br />Surely, these are features which should have stimulated and maintained interest in the case, and yet there is little today.<br />My own interest in this case stems from a short treatment of it given by the great early 20th century true crime writer Edmund Pearson, who lovingly collected true crime stories as an epicure might collect bottles of wine.<br />It made me eager to read more, but this book by Estelle Fox Klieger is the only full-length treatment that I could find.<br />And Ms. Klieger's treatment of the subject is certainly a worthy one.  I am a little disappointed with its dry scholarliness, which does not demonstrate the same sort of tender loving care toward its subject that Pearson's treatment did.<br />But that's a minor objection to what is otherwise an excellent work.  Given the format of a full-length book in which to flesh out her subject, Ms. Klieger is able to give us an even fuller description of the history of old New York and of the social context in which the two lovers behaved and of the political context which caused Hamilton and Burr to join forces for the defense on this occasion.<br />There are several versions of what happened in the trial, and Ms. Klieger is able to rely upon the Coleman transcript, which is believed to be the most accurate.<br />The trial lasted a couple of days and went into the night virtually non-stop (there was one break for sleep, and what the participants did for food and other basic needs, no one seems to know).<br />It must have been a laborious task to pour over the transcript and edit it in such a way to enable the reader to progress through the story without missing anything vital.  Ms. Klieger seems to have done a good job in this, though only someone else familiar with the full transcript could know for sure.<br />The expurgated testimony is liberally interspersed with her commentary, as it must necessarily be, in order to provide proper context and transition.<br />I'm also somewhat disappointed with Ms. Klieger's treatment of the \\"candle incident\\" (which, of course, reportedly took place in the evening while the trial was taking place by candlelight).<br />The \\"candle incident\\" is a legend associated with this trial.  And assuming that it actually took place, it is easily the most dramatic moment of the trial and is described in biographies written by partisans of both Hamilton and Burr, all of whom give credit to their respective subjects for having initiated it.<br />However, Ms. Klieger declares flatly that it never took place because there is no notation of it in the Coleman transcript.<br />But perhaps the legend and the reference to it in the biographies of the attorneys can't be disregarded so lightly.  Perhaps Coleman simply did not know how to record this bizarre incident in the format of an official transcript.  Or perhaps there were other reasons why he chose not to record it.<br />Pearson was not so certain that the story didn't have a factual basis, and Ms. Klieger might be guilty of a surfeit of dryness in disregarding the story so readily.  Perhaps her book could have used just a touch of Pearsonian romanticism and humor.<br />But again, that isn't a major criticism of a very fine book, and some wonderful contemporary prints of New York and of the personages that participated in this incident round it out nicely.<br />Who killed Gulielma Sands?  Or did she make away with herself, as the defense suggested?  No one knows, and while Ms. Klieger doesn't purport to provide the answer to us, I sense that she has her own idea.  Perhaps other readers will come away with an impression different from mine.  But what I perceive as her personal opinion is an undercurrent that runs through the book, which doesn't detract from the objectivity of her analysis.<br />This is an excellent book with which to get acquainted with what should be a classical true-life murder mystery - if only there was interest in it out there to begin with.	2002-04-22

A Democrat yet?  Even in 1964, this must have seemed far-fetched, and from a 2002 perspective, it's sheer lunacy.<br />But for alternative history purposes, that doesn't matter.  The premise IS plausible enough for an excursion into the world of \\"what if\\".  Or should I say the world of \\"never could be\\"?<br />Anyway, in this excursion, Senator Sam follows the straight and narrow bi-partisan path to exposing corruption wherever he finds it.<br />As a result, the 1964 election which was shaping up as a landslide victory for Johnson over Barry Goldwater begins to tighten, and well...the Vietnam War also follows an alternative history path as a result.<br />This isn't a particularly well-written book.  The language is somewhat stilted.  There are clumsy sub-plots involving fictitious characters which could very easily have been eliminated.<br />I don't imagine that the author, William Fox Eckbert, worried greatly about the quality of his writing.  I think that his goal was to display his knowledge of military and political history in order to qualify himself as a prognosticator of how history would have changed.<br />And he does this pretty well, I think.<br />His historical characters are also somewhat flat, but these personalities are varied enough that their foibles still hold our interest.  These historical characters not only include the usual round of suspects such as the Kennedy brothers, LBJ, Goldwater and Senator Sam but also lesser lights such as Senator Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania.<br />And interestingly enough, we also see life from the standpoint of the four members of the North Vietnamese ruling clique, including Uncle Ho.  Eckbert is able to make them, as individuals, surprisingly human without whitewashing the brutality of the Communist system that they have imposed.<br />Eckbert is also able to use this alternative view of history to nod in the direction of real life.<br />The decision that the President has to make of whether to commit enough military manpower and firepower to capture Hanoi is reminiscent of the debate over a similar decision that was made about Iraq in 1991.<br />Since this book was published in 1994, I suspect that this similarity was not a coincidence.<br />However, the CLOSENESS of the Johnson-Goldwater election in this alternative history timeline does bear some coincidental resemblance to the story of the 2000 election, though it is not Florida that is the battleground here.<br />Once upon a time, I would have said that the coverage of Election Day 1964 was a very dramatic event in this book.<br />But after the real-life fiasco that was Election Day 2000, it's an unfair task to expect any author to create acceptable fictitious Election Day drama.<br />And the fact that the loser in this story went down quietly without initiating a series of lawsuits seems absolutely preposterous from a contemporary perspective, but Eckbert can't be blamed for this, of course.<br />It's also fairly apparent that Eckbert had no idea how to end this story after resolving the Vietnam War.<br />But again, if you look at this book as a means of light and informative historical instruction, rather than as pure entertainment, that's one more flaw that can be judged leniently.<br />Recommended reading to all with an interest in this genre and/or in this historical time period.	2002-04-05
US	50691488	R2WSOBH1A7TWR1	0304359599	282958346	Men, Women & War: Do Women Belong in the Front Line?	Books	3	37	55	N	Y	Interesting and informative but uneven and lacking passion	You can often tell the value of a work by the enemies that an author has made.<br />This book, which opposes women in military combat, written by Martin Van Creveld, is readily compared with Brian Mitchell's similar work.  Van Creveld acknowledges his debt to Mitchell.<br />But Mitchell's work is written with the passion of an activist and of an ex-soldier, and Van Creveld's work is written with the passion - well, of a historian.<br />For the high crime of being opposed to women in combat, Mitchell actually lost his job with the oil company that employed him.  How Van Creveld's work stands him in academia is anyone's guess, but this doesn't read like the sort of book that would cost anyone his job.<br />Van Creveld IS a historian, of course, and he cannot be blamed for his academic tone, but it's fairly easy to surmise which of the two books is more readable.<br />This book IS informative, and gives a pretty thorough summary of the history of women in warfare.<br />He runs the gamut from their roles as objects of conquest and instigators (yes - as instigators, good news; contrary to feminist realpolitik, men are actually no more to BLAME for wars than are women), as commanders (largely monarchial women born into the position), to combat support personnel (administrators, nurses, suppliers, etc.), participants in uprisings or against them, and the occasional female foot soldier and/or unit.<br />Really, the text often reads like it was written by a supporter of women in combat since it utilizes the familiar argument that this has happened throughout history.<br />But Van Creveld parses neatly away from this argument by drawing distinctions between stories justified by historical evidence, on the one hand, and myths and anecdotes, on the other.<br />And for those stories that have a factual basis, he argues that it is precisely because the female involvement in military combat is isolated, infrequent, and often distant from the action, the historical examples serve as evidence AGAINST the idea and not for it.<br />He also borrows from other sources such as the Mitchell book to run through the usual physical advantages that men have over women that make them better suited to combat.  These need not be repeated here.<br />But as one might expect from an academic, Van Creveld suffers from the same affliction that most writers making an anti-feminist statement suffer from (and that Brian Mitchell did NOT suffer from) - he is apologetic.<br />Apologetic anti-feminists go into battle (so to speak) with their morale tied behind their back and their objectivity damaged.<br />Van Creveld asserts several times, without providing any evidence, that women who have died in warfare have died as courageously as men.  Maybe some of them, but the same process of human evolution which made most men bigger and stronger than most women also appears to have made men more aggressive and more willing to risk their lives.<br />One would not EXPECT women to display equal amounts of THAT type of courage, and for Van Creveld to suggest without evidence that they have sounds like a way of trying not to sound TOO stridently anti-feminist.<br />And even while enumerating in great detail the physical differences between men and women that Van Creveld says make it \\"criminal\\" (his word) to send women to the front, he concurrently and paradoxically maintains that the all-male nature of combat is based LESS on those differences than it is based on the desire of men to institute a rite of passage that excludes women.  Oh, come on now!<br />He specifically states that if men and women were of equal size and strength, men might STILL exclude women from combat for \\"rights of passage\\" reasons.<br />Well, but if men and women really were similar, the species likely would not perpetuate, or if it did, the forces that sometimes drive men to distance themselves from women likely would not be nearly as prevalent, would they, Professor?<br />Again, I sense that this argument is Van Creveld's way of apologizing for pointing out that men really are more combat-ready.  Vignettes like this show why he's less likely to lose his job than Brian Mitchell.<br />Interestingly enough, while Mitchell warns of imminent disaster if the women-in-combat policy continues, Van Creveld simply shrugs his shoulders and declares that per the historical record, women will always advance in the military during peacetime when they aren't needed and that when war breaks out, sanity prevails and the fighting is turned over to the men.<br />In my opinion, Van Creveld is making a mistake that others before him have made - assuming that human nature and common sense inevitably prevail.  He doesn't take into account that the war on human nature and common sense being waged today is more ferocious than any such war waged before.<br />Still, written before 9/11/2001, this book is quite prophetic.  As the war on terrorism progresses, women indeed have been pulled back from the front lines and Great Britain and Australia pull back from the policy of integrating women into combat forces.<br />Van Creveld also has interesting information for 1)reactionaries like me who blame feminism for the unfeminine ferocity demonstrated today by women in popular culture and 2) evil pro-feminist cultural mandarins who promote such imagery with the motive of warring on gender.<br />The information is that there is nothing new under the sun.  History is replete with prior examples of warlike female imagery promoted either to titillate, to shame, or to provide inspiration or instruction.  It has, says Van Creveld, little effect on how normal men and women conduct their lives.<br />Well, maybe.  But I declare myself not really convinced.<br />In the end, Van Creveld's book, for all its good points, suffers from the same flaw that EVERY conservative, pro-military, and anti-feminist work (including Mitchell's) suffers.<br />It fails to answer two simple questions:  1) What exactly is there about Western society that is worth defending? and 2) What exactly is there about Western women that is worth protecting?ent is Van Creveld's way of apologizing for pointing out that men really are more combat-ready.

I enjoyed this fourth novel in Bruce Alexander's Sir John Fielding series a little more than any of the first three for one principal reason. The book appears to be good enough to stand on its own because there are apparently a large number of people who enjoyed it (and maybe some who DIDN'T enjoy it) without understanding what the author did.<br />But the reason why I enjoyed this book most of all is because I have an interest in the subject matter that this novel REALLY concerns. Because what Alexander did was to take a famous series of serial killings of prostitutes that actually took place in late 19th century London and transpose them into the year 1770, the year in which this novel takes place.<br />Can it be that so many readers failed to recognize that the details of the killings in this novel match so perfectly with the details of the murders that actually took place in Whitechapel in 1888? Just to make the contract a little more binding, the author also gives us a suspect nicknamed \\"Jack-the-carver\\".<br />\\"He'll carve you up, see?\\" Jimmie Bunkins says to his chum, the narrator and main character, Jeremy Proctor, explaining the nickname. \\"Is he what you would call a 'high ripper'?\\" Jeremy asks in reply, using the term that was then used to describe a knife-wielding criminal.<br />The usual cast of characters that Alexander's readers have grown fond of are here: the indomitable Sir John Fielding, his young assistant, Jeremy, Jimmie Bunkins, the reformed former sneak thief and street urchin, and Black Jack Bilbo, Bunkins's guardian and Jeremy's avuncular mentor. And I am happy to report the return of Ignatius Donnelly, the kindly Irish doctor who played a significant role in \\"Blind Justice\\", the first novel in the series before departing for Lancashire in fruitless pursuit of the lovely widow, Lady Goodhope.<br />In addition to that, Jeremy (who seems to have no shortage of worthy adult male role models) is also befriended by Constable Perkins, one of Sir John's \\"Beak Runners\\", who has developed his one arm and his fighting skills to such an extent that he can lick any man with two arms. His imparting of some of those skills to Jeremy plays a significant role in this novel.<br />Jeremy's character development remains of interest to those who have read this series in order. We know of Jeremy's intent to study the law with Sir John, but here we see, for the first time, a \\"flash-forward\\" twenty-seven years into the future where Jeremy has actually become a practicing solicitor. Partly consistent and partly inconsistent with that, we also see Jeremy pitting his own judgment against that of Sir John during a criminal investigation for the first time in this series.<br />And in the third novel, Watery Grave, at the age of 14, Jeremy learns the \\"facts of life\\" from Black Jack Bilbo. \\"Persons Unknown\\" takes place after Jeremy turns 15 and is feeling the yearnings of puberty. His interest in a female street acrobat- turned-prostitute is an interesting sub-plot.<br />There are weaknesses in this novel that a less tolerant reviewer might not so readily excuse. Jeremy's treacly personality is less tolerable at a time when he is entering puberty. Surely, even a well-spoken 15 year old lad in the year 1770 had thoughts and instincts and language considerably more coarse than those displayed here by Jeremy.<br />The fight scene that takes place between Jeremy (after he has received instruction from Constable Perkins) and a street thug is ridiculously one-sided. And Sir John's original plan to trap the murderer is utterly ridiculous and provides more comic relief than the author must have intended.<br />This reviewer's affection for the characters and for the setting in which they perform and his delight at seeing the Whitechapel mystery moved 118 years back in time into a fictitious setting override his objections, and 5 stars are awarded.	2001-08-04

Shirley Harrison's publication of the diary, complete with commentary, and Paul Feldman's investigative work are excellent treatments of the subject, which strongly suggest that the diary is indeed genuine and that the most famous unsolved serial killings are no longer unsolved.<br />But this particular book will disappoint those who are primarily interested in the Maybrick/Ripper angle. As Ms. Graham candidly states in her forward, she did not write the book with the intention of providing any more proof that James Maybrick was the Ripper; she has left that task to others. Therefore, this book does not add any information to that produced by Harrison and Feldman.<br />Instead, this is principally \\"Florrie's\\" story, and the author has simply incorporated the Maybrick/Ripper information produced by the others and woven it into the fabric of Florrie's story. And that story stands on its own, but it leaves the reader even more puzzled about how Florrie and her associates, to an individual, managed to keep their amazing knowledge secret even BEYOND their deaths. The book disappoints in that it makes the Maybrick/Ripper connection a little MORE speculative, not less so.	2001-08-03
US	50691488	R6YAN1G0TZB9G	0525247769	364459234	I, J.F.K.	Books	2	0	6	N	N	Banal and unconvincing	JFK Senior is still probably the most famous dead celebrity so it's rather surprising that no one else has chosen to write a book in which JFK and his contemporaries deliver a retrospective from heaven.<br />So I'll give the author minimum credit for imagination.  And no credit beyond that.<br />The author, Robert Mayer, makes several mistakes.  First of all, he puts JFK, RFK, LBJ, and Martin Luther King in heaven.  This is probably a mistake, as far as the first three go, and even No. 4 might owe an explanation or three before being allowed entry.<br />The author also consigns J. Edgar Hoover and old Joseph Kennedy to hell.  In both those instances, he might be right.  But his treatment of Hoover in particular is extremely distasteful and even juvenile.<br />Even if every rumor about how Hoover lived while he was on this planet was true, the author's treatment of Hoover is way out of line.  WAY out of line.  I think that Robert Mayer fancies himself as a far leftist with a magnanimous ability to see all sides of an issue.<br />It's funny how if you scratch an individual like that just a little beneath the surface, you see that same UGLY thing below the skin that you see in all liberals.  Mayer's tone is pretty reasonable throughout most of the book, EXCEPT for the J. Edgar Hoover scenes.  THAT'S the ugly liberal in Mayer seeping through. He might be Janet Reno in male drag.<br />His treatment of Richard Nixon is surprisingly even-handed.  This book was written in 1988 when Nixon was still alive so Mayer was not required to consign Nixon to heaven or hell.  He got to dodge that bullet.<br />Third of all, the story stars famous dead people in the afterlife.  And when you try to make real the unknowable, even in a work of fiction, it's necessary to establish certain rules and stick to them.<br />Mayer doesn't really do that.  It's not really clear what these dead personalities are able to do and are not able to do -- Mayer unfairly shifts this in order to accommodatewhatever the plot requires, as the characters weave back and forth from their little corner of heaven to other little corners to earth to hell and back.  No fair, Mr. Mayer.<br />Another thing that isn't fair is that when flashing back to actual historical events (the most noteworthy ones, of course, being the assassinations), the author, in Oliver Stone fashion, deliberately mixes fact with fiction without making the distinction clear.<br />A number of the passages in this book include conversations between JFK and his valet in Dallas.  My eyes bugged out as I read the text of these conversations, which seemed remarkably prophetic and then I realized, with disgust, that they were all too prophetic because they were entirely fictitious.  But the author introduces them as history.<br />Fifth of all, does anyone imagine that if these four characters got together again in heaven, they would sit around and discuss issues of policy, as they did on earth?<br />No.  The world of the policy wonk would not have been heaven for the Kennedy brothers, who sought and achieved office in order to fulfill a destiny and not specifically with the goal of influencing policy.<br />Maybe LBJ would be happy as an eternal policy wonk.  MLK, of course, led by inspiration and did not hold elective office.  Maybe, in the event that hell freezes over and Clinton is allowed into heaven, policy wonking might be his second or third choice of recreation.  But not for the Kennedy brothers.<br />Finally, Mayer makes the same mistake that all leftists do.  His &quot;even-handed&quot; treatment of the Kennedy brothers only criticizes them from the left -- they expanded the Vietnam War, they didn't do enough for civil rights, they were too &quot;Cold War&quot; and too obsessed with getting Castro, etc.<br />But as Kenneth Lynn has said, there was a yellow thread of timidity that was interwoven through the ostentatious aggressiveness of the New Frontier.  All of the &quot;hard-nosed&quot; Kennedy actions were done within the framework of domestic politics, which caused them to often betray those who took their fighting words at face value.  Kennedy foreign policy left the Communists more firmly entrenched in Vietnam and Cuba at his death than they were when he took office.<br />The author, Robert Mayer, doesn't raise THIS critique of the Kennedy brothers; as a leftist, he is incapable of understanding it and may not be aware that it exists.<br />The book is readable enough and can be finished in one sitting and might be worthwhile if all that you are looking for is an afternoon of whimsy.  But not if what you are looking for is an honest fictitious treatment of history.	2001-07-30

It helps to be familiar with the first two books in the series and to know that in 1768, Jeremy, who was then thirteen years of age, was taken in by Sir John as a ward of his household.<br />The events of \\"Watery Grave\\" take place in mid-1769, and Jeremy, who is now 14 years old and his young comrade, Tom Durham, are starting to assume an interest and a mystified curiosity in the transaction between men and women that takes place on the streets of London in their presence.<br />\\"I know some but not all,\\" Jeremy says in explaining his curiosity.  \\"I know there are diseases may come of it -- the pox and the like -- and I know that babies come of it too. But I don't know what IT is.\\"<br />Notwithstanding his boyish naivete, Jeremy has already proven his readiness for his initiation into the world of young English manhood when he fires a gun in the interest of justice, both in the predecessor novel \\"Murder in Grub Street\\" and in this novel.<br />And so Jeremy's initiation takes place in \\"Watery Grave\\" when he receives his \\"instruction in that information which all men and women must gain by whatever means\\".  Oddly enough and amusingly enough, this instruction comes not from the embarrassed  father-figure Sir John Fielding (who hastily puts off all such inquiries) but from the avuncular Black Jack Bilbo of uncertain past (rumored to be sinister), who runs the respectable and legal gambling house in Goodhope Manor.<br />Black Jack takes the very pistol which Jeremy fired (after having borrowed it from Black Jack) and plunges it into the holster.  \\"Do y'see how neat this pistol fits into the holster?\\", he asks.<br />Bruce Alexander has come up with another winner in this third edition, and I readily anticipate both Jeremy and readers of this series will continue to be entertained by future revelations.	2001-07-21

David Brock is likely to someday be regarded as the Whittaker Chambers of the 1990's. Both worked or have worked for an evil and implacable enemy on the Left side of the political spectrum. Both men also worked or have worked for patriotic conservative causes fighting the evil and implacable Left, and both Chambers and Brock also made dramatic switches from one side to the other. Both men made their decisions at a time when they were/are struggling with personal turmoil as well as public turmoil; indeed, it may not be entirely coincidental that both were/are homosexual.<br />But, of course, the similarities end when you regard the direction in which each man traveled. Whittaker Chambers left the side of the devils, the American Communist Party members working as Soviet spies, and joined forces with patriotic conservatives trying to rout them out.<br />When Chambers moved from Left to Right, he openly stated that he was convinced that he was leaving the winning side for the losing side but that his conscience would not allow him to act otherwise. Indeed, between the 40's and the 80's, many leftist intellectuals who realized that they had been blinded by the Left (but who were not necessarily CP members) and who were similarly conscience-stricken moved in a direction similar to that of Chambers, and ultimately voted for Ronald Reagan in 1980.<br />Of course, David Brock has moved in the opposite direction. He has moved from Right to Left. Today, the Left is not represented by the forces of international Communism but by our own home-grown American and European yahoos. And while Brock may also self-servingly claim to have been motivated by conscience, he can never manufacture the passion that Chambers did before the House Un-American Activities Committee.<br />Moreover, it is unlikely that Brock believes that he is leaving the winning side for the losing side. Brock cannot be ignorant of the fact that the evil and implacable Left has a vise-like control over the news media, academia, and popular culture -- to say nothing of a large percentage of elected officials. Brock cannot be ignorant of the fame and fortune that these forces are able to offer to one who abandons conservatism to join them. It's fairly safe to say that this fame and fortune was a principal factor in his decision.<br />So what was the truth concerning the Thomas/Hill incident and how should Brock's book, written before the Fall, be regarded today? Does it even matter at this point? After having steadfastly defended President Caligula for eight years -- which included disregarding a credible charge of rape -- and while defending Gary Condit today, how can left-wingers -- without suffering from some sort of disassociative disorder -- still wax indignant over allegations that Clarence Thomas used naugthy language in the presence of Anita Hill?<br />Answer: Because the left-wingers' virtually complete control of the forces that manufacture popular opinion have deprived them of a capacity for critical thinking. And because liberals cheerfully donned moral blinders many years ago -- long before Clinton, who is a symptom and not a cause. And because they are evil and because they are of the Left.<br />Though the allegatins against Clarence Thomas today seem positively puerile in comparison to what is KNOWN about Bill Clinton, Thomas/Hill does still matter today because it marks the first occasion when liberals began to FULLY use the politics of personal destruction as a political weapon.<br />Even the liberal smear campaigns waged against Barry Goldwater in 1964 and against Robert Bork in 1987 were based on misrepresentations of their target's publicly-stated POSITIONS. Liberals dared not wage ideological warfare against Clarence Thomas in 1991; it was necessary to conduct a high-tech political lynching.<br />Well, since Thomas/Hill and the Brock book still matter today, it is noteworthy that Brock, even now, has NOT disavowed his 1993 book as many have declared. Whathe has alleged is 1) that he was \\"used\\" by conservatives; 2) that he was too eager to believe stories that impugned Anita Hill's credibility and her personal qualities and that he did not check these sources; 3) that he did not interview any Democrats on the Senate Committee; and 4) that he was a pawn in the hands of a Thomas associate who wished to silence an anti-Thomas witness.<br />But what is being overlooked is that only a small portion of Brock's case against Anita Hill ever had to do, in the first place, with the allegations concerning her personal life. The overwhelming bulk of the challenge to her credibility stems from the way in which her handlers manipulated her, from the inconsistencies in her conduct toward Clarence Thomas in the aftermath of the horrors that she had supposedly suffered at his hands (Clinton's defenders would use a similar argument to defend him from Kathleen Willey's allegations) and from the timeline that is composed by an analysis of Hill's story and the story told by her witnesses.<br />This composite timeline strongly suggests that any \\"sexual harrassment\\" suffered by Anita Hill OCCURRED BEFORE SHE WENT TO WORK FOR CLARENCE THOMAS. Before he turned bad, Brock was in the forefront of journalistic efforts to bring Hill's associates, contradictions and this timeline to the public's attention.<br />And it is these efforts, outlined in Brock's book, that still make the book worth reading.<br />After Brock's book came out, someone did ask Hill what she thought of its contents. Her reply was not the indignant reply of the wronged woman. \\"His reality,\\" she simply stated \\"differs from mine.\\" And in this pregnant reply, we may perceive not a genuine victim but a slick lawyer practicing Catherine MacKinnon-like feminist jurisprudence, in which objective reality is subordinated to what a female accuser chooses to believe AFTER THE FACT.<br />Read \\"The Real Anita Hill\\" in order to learn how a once-good conservative man used his journalisticskills to display the belly of this evil liberal beast -- before he was swallowed himself.	2001-07-18

Bunkins's morally-flawed but street-wise personality makes him a good foil to Jeremy.<br />When he warns Jeremy, \\"You'll do nicks to me, for I see no Beak-runners by your side, nor barking irons in your daddles\\", I was pleasantly surprised to realize that I had no trouble interpreting this to mean, \\"You'll do nothing to me, for I don't see any officers of the law with you or any guns in your pockets.\\"<br />Bunkins's colorful mode of expression, as well as his personality, make him an attractive character in spite of his faults. And if he seems a little too Dickensian to be regarded as completely of the author's creation, Alexander pays proper homage to the origins of this character by describing him as running away \\"at full speed, dodging artfully through the pedestrians in the street.\\"<br />Bunkins's introduction into the series also provides the occasion for the re-introduction of \\"Black Jack\\" Bilbo, the owner of the gambling house on St. James Street with the mysterious and reputedly sinister past, who is also a stimulating character.<br />And notwithstanding Jeremy's sometimes too-treacly personality, there are a number of things which ensure that the story itself never gets too sugary. The mystery around which it centers is the gruesome murder of the household of Ezekiel Crabb, publisher and book-seller in Grub Street, and we are also introduced to the grotesque image of \\"The Raker\\", who collects and disposes of corpses for the cities of London and Westminster (\\"He enjoys his work too much. There is something unholy about the man,\\" Sir John remarks). There is also a not-easily-forgotten trip to Bedlam, the famed London insane asylum, as it existed in the 18th century.<br />While the revelation that climaxes this novel may not be all that surprising, the climax is still filled with more drama than that the first novel contained.<br />All in all, an excellent sequel, and I look forward to reading the next novels in the series.	2001-07-01

I am somewhat of a collector of Harold Sherman's sports books -- the ones that he wrote during the 1920's and 1930's.<br />I bought the paperback edition of this particular book (originally written in 1981) out of curiosity.<br />When I think of Harold Sherman, I think of all of those stirring high school and college sport operas that he wrote about the world of fresh air and fair play where teamwork and good sportsmanship inevitably prevail and where the big game is ALWAYS won in the end with a thrilling come-from-behind finish.<br />I bought this paperback because I was genuinely curious (but I must admit, a little disillusioned) about the fact that Harold Sherman, whom I had always though of as a bedrock of down-to-earth Midwestern values, had actually become a parapsychologist in the latter two-thirds of his life and was actually interested in the subject of communicating with the dead and other paranormal activities.<br />Talk about the antithesis of down-to-earth!<br />Well, this book was certainly entertaining enough to hold my interest, but it's really only for true believers in the paranormal and not for those like myself who are fans of Sherman's EARLIER works.<br />I acknowledge that I like Sherman's version of the afterlife more than I like that of most people. For personal reasons, I appreciate the absence of hell, at least in the way that it is traditionally conceived.<br />And I also like the complete ABSENCE of reincarnation in Sherman's view of the universe. It's much more comforting to imagine that those who have left us are waiting just around the corner for us to rejoin them, rather than being reborn into a slum in Calcutta.<br />But where O where, Mr. Sherman, is the SPORTS? I searched in vain, but I found NO MENTION ANYWHERE OF SPORTS in Harold Sherman's version of the afterlife.<br />Do you really mean, Mr. Sherman, that even YOU can discern no Valhalla on the other side where star fullback Bob Delano and super-sub Rusty Milburn, playing within the confines of a celestial version of Yankee Stadium, AGAIN crash the line on behalf of good old Bartlett in the big game against arch-rival Pennington and its ace back, King Moulton?<br />Is there really no setting on the other side where Prescott team members AGAIN agonize over how to defend against Redfield's top slugger Bingo Nelson (so-called because his line drives travel -- BINGO! -- down the third base line threatening the welfare of rival teams and the health of their third basemen) with no outs and the bases loaded?<br />\\"I'm still with you,\\" Chic Hutchins gasps in \\"Hold That Line\\" to his supposed arch-enemy, Bowen teammate Vic Wanderman, who is heading downfield in a desperate attempt to [grab]victory from the jaws of defeat, at the hands of arch-rival Great Northern, by crossing the goal line with the pass that he intercepted. \\"Keep on going, old boy! I won't let 'em cut...you...down!\\" <br />Hutchins then throws a tremendous block on Wanderman's behalf, and this last-instant combat zone reconciliation of bitter rivals is enough to bring a manly tear to any eye.<br />Did Harold Sherman really come to envision an afterlife in which there no ethereal grass and white-chalked stages where such dramas are re-enacted?<br />I can only hope that Harold Sherman, wherever he is today, is intensely lobbying the powers-that-be for his domain to be graced with the early 20th century high school/college sports ethos (and with the lads that personified that ethos) that he once wrote about.<br />And anyone who wants to talk to Harold Sherman about all of this might certainly be interested in reading \\"The Dead Are Alive\\" and obtaining insight on how Harold Sherman himself recommended attempting to communicate with the dead.<br />But I can't help wonder if this book hasn't been overtaken by technology. It describes how one might purchase powerful and sophisticated tape recording equipment and hear the voices of the departed through the \\"white noise\\" that is heard when ablank tape is run.<br />Sherman acknowledges that radio waves and telephone lines are often the source of other voices and suggests that \\"practice makes perfect\\" when attempting to distinguish a spirit's voice from that of radio or telephone sound wave.<br />But considering the fax machines, cell phones, pagers, Internet access call signals, and microwave ovens that have been created since Sherman first wrote this book, you really have to figure that it's just that much more difficult (if not IMPOSSIBLE) for a communicative spirit to get through and for the aspiring parapsychologist to discern such spirits through all of that additional interference.	2001-06-16
US	50691488	R5Z1QB0D5EZYP	0425150070	984430309	Blind Justice (Sir John Fielding)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Fiction rings as true as history	This is a very entertaining historical murder mystery set in pre-Revolutionary War London.<br />The principal character is Sir John Fielding, the blindfolded sightless justice, whose condition and whose ideals indeed enable us to see him as the living personification of \\"Justice\\" (traditionally blindfolded) but who is, in his own way, more clear-sighted than anyone else.<br />And the narrator through whose perspective we hear the story is plucky 13 year-old Jeremy Proctor of Stoke Poges, who flees his home town after a family tragedy, to find what appears to be his destiny as Sir John's ward, his eyes, his investigator, and his Watsonian-like sounding board.<br />Quite an accomplishment for a 13 year-old but then, how many 13 year-olds TODAY (for that matter, how many adults)are familiar with the works of Voltaire and Shakespeare, as Jeremy is?<br />Because this is historical fiction, the author, as might be expected, introduces us to some actual historical figures as the actor David Garrick and the author/solicitor James Boswell. He makes them as real as the characters that he has created out of his imagination.<br />And equally real is 18th Century London and Covent Garden, the stomping grounds of both Jeremy and his guardian. Although Jeremy is the narrator, we often are treated to Sir John's perspective of his surroundings.<br />This is a particularly clever and entertaining \\"touch\\" on the part of the author, Bruce Alexander. Sir John can only perceive Covent Garden through his senses of sound and smell, and as is often the case with the blind, these senses are particularly well-developed to compensate for the loss of the other. (\\"You who have sight are often so wasteful of your other senses,\\" Sir John remonstrates on one occasion). This make it all the easier for the reader to \\"hear\\" and \\"smell\\" what the characters do.<br />Bruce Alexander brings 18th century London to life for his readers without, it should be noted, glossing over what a 21st century reader would regard as the faults from that era.<br />The mystery itself, the puzzling death of Lord Goodhope in his study, moves along at a brisk pace, and I am giving this book 4 stars only because I felt that the climax, while entertaining, might have fallen just a little short of the expectations created by the rest of the novel.<br />Still, it's a great read, and I highly recommend it for all age groups, regardless of the extent of their familiarity with Voltaire and Shakespeare.	2001-06-15

Still, Farrell makes good use of the space alloted to him, and the overwhelmingly favorable response demonstrated in the other reviews that I have read here show just how long overdue and necessary a book like this is. I have little to add to them, except to say that Robert Howland said everything that I would have wished to say but better since his studies in anthropology give him the academic credibility that I lack. Perhaps I can say the same thing a little more simplistically. I too am extremely grateful to Farrell for putting the lie to that \\"official\\" UN Statistic about women doing 2/3 of the world's work for 1/10 the pay. Anyone who has seen how hard men work know that this is one of those \\"state\\" lies that HAS to be untrue, but I don't think that there was ever a way to refute it until now. That lie is no less of a LIE and no less pernicious than the content of the \\"Protocols of the Elders of Zion\\", but when men (and not Jews or other ethnic minorities) are the target, sensitivity and fairness are tossed out of the window in a Bobbitt-like quest for blood. And like Mr. Howland, I am skeptical of Farrell's notion that all that needs to happen to improve the welfare of men is \\"better communication\\". That is too touchy-feely and too SIMPLISTIC an observation. When Valeries Solanas (who shot Andy Warhol) of The Society for Cutting Up Men (SCUM) advocated eliminating men, this was seen as an unrepresentative statement made by someone from the extreme radical wing of the feminist movement. But when male-bashing by the networks and by Madison Avenue is used to lure female consumers EN MASSE into watching TV shows and buying products, virulent HATRED of the male sex can no longer be said to be representative of only an EXTREMIST faction. And consider how many respected journals of opinion, modern-day \\"Mein Kampfs\\" talk quite seriously in didactic Solanas-like terms of the supposed \\"irrelevance\\" of the male sex and of doing away with men completely. It's crazy to think that \\"better communication\\" would change any of this. No, unmotivated hatred of men is a universal problem and it is an attitude probably shared (in varying degrees) by the vast majority of women. So whatever the answer is to this problem, the prescription should be a POLITICAL one and not merely more hugs and kisses. The political solution certainly doesn't rest with the Republican Party, as one other reviewer suggested. The GOP may not be as wedded to feminism as are the Democrats, but feminism and male-bashing are ubiquitous enough forces to have corrupted the ENTIRE system. And when so many men acquiesce in their own oppression, a political solution is that much harder to envision. That's one flaw in the book -- the fact that Farrell assumed that he was speaking for ALL men. In fact, there are many men who willingly participate in their own oppression! Why are there so many MALE feminists? Isn't a male feminist as contemptible and as filled with self-hatred and as oxyMORONIC as would be a Jewish Nazi or a black Klansman? I would have liked to hear what Farrell, as an ex-member of the National Organization for Women (! ), would say to that.	2000-01-12
