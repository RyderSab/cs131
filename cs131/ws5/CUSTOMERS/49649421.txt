US	49649421	R1N3KEFA2R211T	1552042413	30092272	Butterfly	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Fiction is no stranger	Evicted after her boyfriend skipped out with the rent money, pregnant China Brown starts walking to the mission but encounters a tall blonde woman who's being photographed by Chaz Finelli, the paparazzi pix guy.  Blondie shoots Chaz, takes his camera, turns and shoots China, the only witness, and leaves her for dead.  Homocide detective Ben English arrives to find that China is barely alive and he follows the ambulance to the hospital, hoping she can identify the shooter.  Thus begins Ben's strange attraction to China, that becomes more understandable when we learn his family background.  Beautiful China, who was told she was ugly as a child and believed it, tries to die because her baby was killed by one of the bullets fired at her.  But while (in her life after life experience) her dead mother takes the baby, a little girl, she sends China back.  This book is for those who like tender.  Ben is all man but a gentle one.  He keeps his promises and it is this thread that China clings to as she slowly regains consciousness.  But the plot revolves around the shooting, who and why, and this part of the plot elevates this book from a ho-hum romance to an edge-of-the-seater.  Power, privilege, the nouveau riche...it's all here.  If I did not know some Texans who fit some of these roles, it would be less believable but I do and they do.  Some may feel there are too many subplots but Sala makes them work.  And just when we think China will never realize her delicate beauty, she does realize it by watching a butterfly crawl from its ugly chrysallis.  Ben had already proposed to her, so she turns the tables and proposes to him.  And the shooter?  You wouldn't believe it if I told you, so read the book.	2005-08-20

Las Vegas showgirls are always popular heroines and poker is also in fashion now.  When Jax (a child prodigy estranged from a father he felt expected not too much but all the wrong things from him) first meets his former stepmother, he has all the usual stereotypes but Treena surprises him constantly.  She is not a plastic person and eventually Jax realizes that.  Slowly the romance develops, on the back of quick attraction.  The secondary plots involving Treena's best friends and chosen family are believable.  I did feel sex romps were overemphasized but then I've never personally known any Las Vegas natives.  I mean, 24/7?  May not be one of her best but very worth the read and not real easy to put down.	2005-07-07

Which came with abuse.  Six months pregnant she fled for her life and her child's life and for 2 years has been living with a firefighter in another town.  It's a day-at-a-time mutually agreeable situation since niether wants ties.  But when Kate/Tricia's best friend disappears and her estranged husband is charged with murder, she knows she has to return to save him, not that she loves him any more - her heart is with the firefighter - but she cannot let a man go to prison for killing her when she is alive.  I like this author and I liked this story until the very end when Kate/Tricia suddenly sends her brain out to lunch and behaves with incredible stupidity, when she seems to become a victim once again.  It sort of ruined the story for me at that point.  Sometimes people have to return to abusive situations for good and sufficient reasons but usually they take steps to protect themselves as much as possible and she doesn't.  But I carp.  Read the book and decide for yourself.  Love with the firefighter does triumph in the end.	2005-07-07

Left to fend for herself after her father loses everything, Alexandria Linnell becomes one of those dreaded Regency drudges--the poor relation companion at the beck-and-call of an irasicible old relative.  Dropped by her betrothed so that he can marry an heiress and pursue a political career, she is \\"propositioned\\" by another childhood companion, the Honorable Harry Romney.  Harry says he cannot bear to see her in her present position and since he has to marry anyway, he might as well rescue her from her situation.  Ah, pride!  In fact, Harry does care for Alex but refuses to say so and only by his actions can the reader assume his affection.  There is some Metzger humor here, some mistaken grieving over the jilt, but Alex settles in and adventures lead her to recognize that she does love Harry.  I believe this sort of book is usually referred to as a romp.  You will enjoy it.	2005-06-14

Lady Samantha has never met the Marquis of Carrington and yet she must marry him or be forced into hinterland exile by her obnoxious cousin Gerald.  Courageously, Samantha visits Carrington but leaves with no hope that he will agree to marry her.  He does, just in time, but is shot before they can wed leading to a midnight wedding while he is on his sick bed, recovering from the wound.  Needless to say, the marriage is not off to a good start and this leads to misunderstanding.  But neither Samantha nor Carrington can deny their attraction and desire to make this marriage work and we are left knowing that it will. The manners and mores are true to the genre, there is humor but not silliness, and the characters read true to their era. The secondary characters are good and the subplot works and does not detract from the primary. Just a deeply satisfying read for Regency lovers. I had not previously read Fontayne but now I find myself wanting to locate and get all her books.	2005-06-14

It is too much to say that The Well Body Book founded the alternative medicine movement but it blasted the awe in which the general public beheld the medical profession up until that time.  It also was a necessary resource for a generation that rejected the wisdom of its parents and grandparents, in the process throwing away the accumulated folk knowledge of medicines and health practices that had worked for centuries.  Iconoclastic, The Well Body Book did lay the foundation for the health self-help movement that today exists as physican/patient partnerships for health and well-being in which the \\"health partners\\" are equal participants in staying healthy and recovering from illness.  This 31-year old book is not out-of-date.	2005-03-05

I liked everything about it, including Cooper and Josie having to get books on childcare so they could learn enough to do it.  One reviewer thought Josie was too inflexible, but I have been where Josie is and I felt her character was right on target.  Yes, she took terrible advantage of Cooper's love for her, to the point where she almost lost him but poverty makes you do that and it is very hard to let go of the fear.  If your parents were children during the Depression, you know the feeling because they don't let you forget the fear either.  This is a couple, both professionals dedicated to their careers, who are suddenly faced with responsibility for little people and I loved Cooper for not letting these children go to strangers.  Do not, do not, pass this one up.  I read it and immediately began to read it again.  Definitely a keeper and one of Brockmann's best.	2004-11-03

The Mississippi Choctaw had every difficulty faced by every other Nation but they have accomplished tribal development, culturally relevant education for their children, culturally based health care, and full employment, not with federal and state hand-outs but with hard work, honor, and typical \\"Choctaw humor\\" as they used the \\"system\\".  In a region of the U.S. where everyone was either black or white, where was the place for a People that was neither?  But they have made a place--economically, socially, and culturally and today they are about the fifth largest employer in the state. How they arrived at that status is what the Choctaw Revolution is about.  The book spells out the route to success but I found Chapter 7 the most informative in another way.  When I worked in tribal development and Indian Child welfare years ago in Oklahoma, I wondered why the BIA was so obstructive to tribal development when it was the one agency of the federal bureaucracy charged with bringing that about.  Chapter 7 tells me why.  Each Nation faces some challenges that are different but many that are the same.  What worked for the Mississippi Choctaw will work for other Nations as well--without their having to sacrifice their cultural identity in the process.	2004-09-08

In almost 40 years of reading this genre I have yet to see its equal.  You have to think about the possibility of raising evolution another notch via \\"liquid information\\" and you have to ponder the great love each mentor has for his/her protege to begin to appreciate Staton's ideas.  This is one definitely not to miss.	2004-09-08

Compiled by Mary Stetson Clarke, these papers are valuable to women's studies and women's history in this country and for comparison to similar stories in other societies.  While many pioneer women would disagree that women once existed in virtual slavery in the U.S., most women today will agree that women's social and political statuses today are much better.  Some feminist scholars will be familiar with Abigail Adams letter to John Adams of March 31, 1776, but how many feminists have seen the sheet music for \\"I'm a Suffragette\\"? Facsimiles of both documents are included in this collection. These documents are valuable for constructing lesson plans and lectures on the study of social movements as well as feminism and will appeal to sociologists, anthropologists, political scientists, psychologists, and social workers.	2004-08-14

The pace was fast and furious but the devil is in the details. A plot cannot stand by itself but must have context. A 12-going-on-13-year-old boy in 1867 was almost an adult and Casey would be considered a woman grown - many girls were married at 15 and mothers by 16. And a &quot;tall&quot; Comanche would have been 5'7&quot;. If you want a tall Native American in the Plains states, you have to go to Pawnee or Osage. So I gave this book 2 stars. Less picky readers would rate it higher based on the innocent steamy sensuousness.	2004-07-22

The (...) is still beyond steamy but now it is part of the plot and not laminated on because \\"that's what you do\\".  Nikki has lost years out of her life, reconstructed from data but not from the memories she carries with her.  Her capture and degrading torture, her rescue and recovery-- these are classic themes of the genre.  Also, Nikki's memories of her grandmother's teachings were central to her recovery and really gave a necessary ethnic flavor.  Regaining her husband and re-establishing trust - a great read, and would have been without all the bedroom action.  And Low leaves the door open for a sequel with ancillary characters.  I'll be watching for the next one.	2004-04-08

Not another snow sex scene	Creighton's One Christmas Knight is an okay read especially if you like a good ol' Southern trucker delivering a baby at a rest stop in the middle of a Texas Panhandle blizzard.  Actually, it's a pretty good story and a believable variation on a different kind of \\"virgin\\" birth.  The Bevarly section, Jake's Christmas, uses the tried and true plot of the poor boy who grows up, makes good, and becomes a misogynist because of his divorce.  The instant passion between Jake and Rebecca is also tried and true, but please...has anyone ever really undressed partially or wholly to have a secxual encounter in the snow?  Maybe snow is different in Kentucky than in Kansas but it gets cold here.  I quit Bevarly at that point - the story was not worth my time to finish.	2004-03-19

Nevertheless, I do not consider it a balanced perspective of this still controversial research area and I would not use it for any of the classes I teach.  At some point in the future we will look back on this period of scholarship in anthropology and wonder why we struggled so hard to come up with popular answers when other conclusions were equally indicated. Solid social science steps outside the constraints of cultural popularity/political correctness at any given era.  Yet, it is understandable that many of these papers do not.  Alternative explanations do not easily find publication and are often derided by one's peers.  At best, this book joins a growing pseudo-scientific literature about human sexual expression and the social and cultural environments in which it occurs.	2003-09-04

One thing it took away was the willingness and ability of Americans as individuals to take responsibility for themselves and to be accountabe for their actions.  Compassionate conservatism is a way to return responsibility and accountability to individuals and, in so doing, freeing them from poverty, addictions, and other negative behaviors.  Many people attack compassionate conservatism as some religious trend but if all religious elements are stripped from it, what remains is the same idea of taking responsibility for one's own actions that mental health professionals try to get their clients to develop.  If you have never worked with any of the populations Olasky describes, then you are not qualified to judge what he has written about them and whether compassionate conservatism offers a way out of their depressing lifestyles.  I have been a member of some of those populations and I have worked with them since \\"recovering\\".  There may be other ways to achieve success but compassionate conservatism offers something sure-fire.  It works when other methods don't.  Marvin Olasky does write with the pedantism of the academic.  If you get past that, however, the message is compelling.  The book is a quick read.	2003-03-10

Without placing blame or guilt, Takaki discusses the principal ethnic groups whose roles in history have deeply affected the American experience.  This is not to deny the validity of the experiences of other ethnic groups-- each has its unique story to tell.  But the invasion of Native America, the enslavement of Africans, the betrayal of Mexicans, and the prejudicial treatment of the other groups mentioned are embedded in our national psyche and have to be exorcised before America as a society can begin to heal and to deal honestly with all of its separate ethnic parts.  The &quot;racialization of savagery&quot; and demonizing of ethnic groups are valuable insights about intercultural interaction. A Different Mirror is a required text in my cultural diversity classes, though many students are uncomfortable with some of it, particularly the Mexican American chapters.  Making members of the majority culture uncomfortable is part of what makes A Different Mirror effective.  We need to be honest about our past so that we can ensure that our future as a multiethnic society makes it possible for all groups to be acknowledged and to contribute to the whole of who America is.	2003-03-10

The Triumphs of Joseph is simply one of the most important books to be written since the Civil Rights Movement.  I teach diversity classes and I use Triumphs as a primary text to offset the constant presentation by black leaders (often self-proclaimed) and the media that African Americans are somehow deficient in ordinary resilience and social strategies and need the paternalistic help of governmental and private agencies.  Why do so many people who are not disadvantaged feel free to define for the disadvantaged what their needs, wants, and goals are?  Dr. Woodson is sure to offend those who are the vicarious victims and parasitic victimizers of the poor but the validity of his message cannot be denied.  Coming from a disadvantaged background myself, I have lived some of the situations he describes yet today I hold a doctorate and teach at the college level.  Dr. Woodson is definitely a winner with a winning plan. If you want to be a winner, stick with the winners.	2003-03-10

Those expressions are Georgian and even if they were not, it is not necessary to use them to write a good Regency. The main characters have promise but they are sort of dragged from page to page, vascillating about their attraction to each other as they try to undo the marriage. That some of the other characters do not ring true to the period is a common problem with American writers trying to &quot;do&quot; Regency England.  There was nothing democratic about it--rank was everything.  Also,Cameron's brother would never bring his doxy to his brother's house to meet the bride nor would Cameron have a picture of his mistress in his house. Some behaviors were beyond the pale and to pretend otherwise wastes a good plot opportunity. Definitely not of the caliber of &quot;Lord Radcliffe's Season&quot; but I'm trying to finish it anyway.	2002-08-20

To date I have reread this book 4 times.  Jaded arrogant Gabriel, Lord Rainsford thinks quiet, mousy Verity will make him a great wife who will know her place, fill his nursery, and cause him no trouble.  And it's true.  She will do those things but she has more to offer, such as loyalty, devotion, and compassion.  And this hard-hearted man soaks it up like rain in the desert. Gabriel takes what he wants and he wants Verity. By asking nothing and offering everything, Verity brings healing to a bitter man.  This is a Regency that plays a little fast and loose with the genre but in this instance it makes for a great read.  And I have only mentioned a tiny part of the plot.  You'll want to know about Gabriel's parents, his years at sea, and his finding his grandmother.  But the best part?  When Verity wakes after her wedding night to find Gabriel beside her and &quot;her eyes widened and filled with joy, like a child who has received a most wondrous present&quot;.

True to the genre, it takes little to destroy Verity's reputation and the destruction was Lord Rathbone's intent as revenge for how she described his character to a friend. What saves the plot at this point is that Rathbone is falling in love with Verity but does not realize it and that is one reason he continues to show her particular attention.  Her reputation ruined, Verity is attacked by the very spoiled Miss Pettiforth and literally cast out into the night. Forced to go home to an empty house, Verity's brother finds her there when he returns from the American wars. Rathbone's host Mr. Pettiforth invites him to leave because of his treatment of Verity. In the subplot Mr. Pettiforth reclaims control of his family as a reult of this incident and arranges to send his daughter to a select seminary specializing in spoilt beauties. But wait! The plot is much more complex and Buck fully realizes its promise. Rathbone's mother has nourished a desire for vengeance against her husband's brothers and uses her son as her instrument.  Verity's betrothal to Rathbone (she does love him) to prevent her brother from calling him out and killing him puts her in line for foul play by Rathbone's uncles.  Buck write so true to the Regency period and she is a joy to read.  Her characters are not overdone or underdone but always true to themselves.  Her plots and characters have a redemptive quality similar to Mary Balogh's best. Lord Rathbon's Flirt is one of several of Buck's books that I have read 4-5 times and read yet again. Each re-read reveals subtle nuances previously overlooked that add spice and enjoyment.  Maybe I'll just re-read it now.	2002-08-20

Ellie wants to redeem her father's reputation, even though he died in prison serving time for a crime he did not commit.  The &quot;rogue cop&quot; character was suspenful-- even knowing the bad guy, suspense was maintained by whether he would slip up and be caught.  Ellie did not plan to fall for Michael, &quot;good cop&quot; but wounded child, but she could not help herself.  For beneath his armor he is a vulnerable man who wants to love but is afraid he does not know how and wants to be loved but what woman could love him if his mother could not?  One also gets the impression Finn would like to know normal love between a man and a woman but cannot trust himself to take a chance.  Of course, knowing him for the villain he is, we as readers are torn between hoping he will find the redeeming love of a good woman and hoping he will be caught before he kills again.  Definitely a keeper and worth staying up until 2:00 a.m. to finish.	2002-03-18

Amanda, elder daughter of the Amberly Assortment (most of whom have different fathers), has known scandal all her life but did not plan to marry the scandalous scoundrel, Viscount North, whom her mother tried to compromise by sending to her bed. North is an enigma throughout the book which makes for great plot suspense.  He is the consummate rake and yet something does not ring true.  He seems to attempt to seduce Amanda, even knowing she is chaste and after having agreed to help her capture Sir Giles, but never quite goes through with it.  One is left with the feeling he is bored with it all, having done it before.  But North has never met anyone like Amanda and she so intrigues him that he cannot let her get away and he pursues her, fighting himself all the way.  The totally surprising ending makes the book several cuts above the (sometimes) regrettably Regency fluff from other authors.  Definitely, Edith Layton is an author I will seek out.	2002-03-18

Although written for graduate students and working professionals, I have used it with independent study and directed reading courses for senior undergraduates planning to enter an MSW program.  They have given me positive feedback about the value of this book during their internships in social and human services agencies. A good counterbalance to the over-specialization that hit social work education about 3 decades ago.	2001-06-30

It is a compact, convenient collection of African American philosophy that serves to balance a Eurocentric educational system.  The wit and wisdom of Ben Franklin?  How about the wit and wisdom of Tina Turner?  Or Malcolm X?  Was Booker T. Washington an &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; or a gifted leader who gave direction and hope to a generation at a time when to stand up for your rights could mean certain death or at least painful lessons?  Depending on your own cultural origins, you will laugh, cry, curse, or fail to understand some of the quotations or the linguistic expressions between the covers of &quot;Ebony&quot; but your life will be enriched to the degree you reflect on the thoughts of African Americans represented here, many of whom succeeded against the odds in our society before Civil Rights and Affirmative Action.  Do not be without this book.	2001-06-30

Aeschliman offers reasoned commentary and plans for action and, because of his background, bridges the often too-wide gap between Americans who are religious and those who are secular.  We are all in this life together and we should, no matter our ideology, work together to find solutions to the problems we face.  Aeschliman is not proselytizing when he describes Islam's global advances--he pleads for mutual tolerance.  He is not saying &quot;I told you so&quot; when he discusses the decline and fall of Russian communism--rather he asks what America is to do in a post-communist world when for so many decades, her Cold War focus has not only given her an enemy but has blinded her to the humanity we share with citizens of communist countries.  Throughout, Aeschliman never loses the direction of his faith walk nor becomes distracted from his vision of a Christian global future.  But the book is not a preaching polemic for a single view and non-religious people will find it interesting and worth their while.	2001-06-30

Now is the time to read The Hunger for More because it is possible to look back and reflect on Shames's thoughts and predictions.  &quot;Hunger&quot; is one of the most readable accounts of the social and economic forces of the last few decades, how American life has been affected by affluence, and what it has done to Americans as individuals.  &quot;A sickness called success&quot; may be the best chapter--how we as individuals make choices that eventually rebound on us as well as society.  A little feedback goes a long way.  Extremely readable, not a dry scholarly treatment of how we lost our values or why our society is fragmenting into dozens of class-based but culturally (read &quot;racially&quot;) emphatic parts.	2001-06-30

Anthropologists will quibble with Griggs and Dunn about whether a particular learning style is the result of culture or a cause of it.  The debate would really be about the validity of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and, as such, belongs in another academic arena.  Griggs and Dunn have written a good guide for the classroom teacher who wants to understand her/his multicultural students better.  The book is a significant contribution to the field because multicultural children are often labeled as having learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, and related learning problems when the difficulty is really cultural and is related to (a) the worldview of the culture based on economic and social factors related to being a member of a minority culture, and (b) how education is valued and whether it is relevant to a child's family and home environment.  For these reasons, educators can benefit greatly by reading Multiculturalism and Learning Style.	2001-06-30

The views presented in this book were some of the first challenges to &quot;traditional race-relations wisdom&quot; which have come to be accepted doctrine today.  The collection of papers is especially valuable to help us understand how EuroAmericans were &quot;puppet-masters&quot; who benefited by playing other cultural groups against each other. And, though EuroAmericans often were helped in various ways by Native Americans and African Americans these &quot;good works&quot; did not lead to social rewards by their EuroAmerican peers. In light of current debate over reparations, the existence of Indian slavery in South Carolina before Africans were enslaved there (Duncan)brings up the issue of reparations to their descendants. Perhaps most fascinating is Alpert's paper on the origins of African slavery in which he develops the chronology of indentured servant to slave in Maryland.  Since this process occurred elsewhere in the U.S. and with other groups, it is a valuable insight.  Not light reading--but no one who considers him/herself informed about culture wars and cultural issues should ignore this book.	2001-06-23

He challenges several accepted views about Native population decline resulting from disease and warfare which are sure to spark disagreement; yet his logic is difficult to refute and the perspectives he offers provide new directions for research. Martin manages to avoid casting anyone into the roles of oppressor and victim by presenting the sequence of events as the result of rational decisions by both cultural groups.  While anthropologists and sociologists will certainly find &quot;Keepers&quot; of interest, anyone who teaches cultural diversity or provides diversity training will also benefit from this work.  General readers will enjoy asking themselves if their ancestors could have been involved in the events Martin describes.	2001-06-23

Though some may consider a 1989 copyright dated, its value for the college professor lies in its foundational approach and the freedom it allows the prof to tailor content to his/her students' needs.  One does not have to constantly battle an ideological polemic and, for this reason, the book is excellent for sectarian colleges.  I have used the book for over 10 years, with excellent student feedback.	2001-06-23

Several models are available and are well presented in the volume.  Though almost too much is attempted, particularly recommended are the articles in Part II.  When combined with empowerment theory and the strengths-based approach to case management, Reinventing Human Services provides a perspective that holds real hope for change.  The situation must improve--it can hardly get worse.	2000-12-21
