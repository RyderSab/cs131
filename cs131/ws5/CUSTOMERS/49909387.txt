There have been many other reviews of this book that I agreed with, and you should read them, but I decided to also concur with those who gave this book the low score it deserves (how can some people applaud this crazy book?). This woman writes some shocking things about sex, basically saying that men are all evil violators of women. This book is anti-male, and the author basically goes through all of these problems and generalizes that men abuse women, and that it's a big conspiracy. This women is iconoclastic and atheist, and she obviously hasn't gotten any you know what. She uses all of these extreme examples that portray men as a bunch of abusive husbands that use coercion to have sex. What is her conclusion? There doesn't seem to be any except that she is roundly accusing the male gender of all these nasty things. Obviously there are example cases where there have been abusive husbands, rapists, and pimps. There are definitely flaws in society regarding the gender relations and double standards, but women have some advantages that men don't have also. There are problems in society, but that doesn't make all males rapists. She likens the act of sex to some kind of violent crime, and it's shocking. She doesn't acknowledge that sex is enjoyable and serves for reproduction, and that humanity would perish if people didn't have sex. She may have a few points, but they are all covered with an angry and hateful sheen. Furthermore, she uses too much profanity in this book and seems to rant incoherently. Overall, this is a book that is sexist, except against males.	2004-06-18

Overcoming Procrastination is a great audio tape that I enjoyed listening to. There are so many good techniques here to use to overcome procrastination. Procrastination is a big problem that plagues many people, myself included. <br />I listened to these tapes in my car and it was really insightful. Susan Fowler is a really good speaker who sounds enthusiastic. She uses many real-life examples to get you motivated. Her advice is excellent and she has many interesting stories. She talks about techniques to stop delaying like the &quot;inch-worm technique&quot;, and organizing your life with lists and notes. She talks about the problems that lead to procrastination, like fear of failure and fear of success, and analysis paralysis and thinking that everything has to be perfect when you do it. I want to go and listen to these tapes over, because there's lots of good advice.	2004-02-13

There are many chapters that deal with issues such as protein, fats, sugars, caffein, carbohydrate-loading, and other things. It explains how the body has energy stored inside as fat and there's also oxygen that is readily available. <br />What I didn't like about this book were the opening paragraphs that were stories to each chapter. Some of them were too stereotypical. The other thing I didn't like was the sample menu's for someone to eat every day. They seemed to be too light for most people. There was one that said for breakfast all you eat is some cereal, orange juice, some fruit, and a piece of toast. I had heard before that breakfast was the most important meal of the day.	2004-01-16

I looked warily on all those children who loved the book so much. What was all the commotion about, I thought? Years passed by and Rowling produced more books. I kept my distance and didn't read any of them. Soon however, my own brothers were starting to read it. They sat fixated on her books for hours. I was puzzled and didn't see what the big fuss was about. I just assumed that her books weren't very good and were for little kids. Soon however, my brothers told me to start reading it. Finally, I budged and decided to would read the first book. So I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. To my surprise, it was actually a pretty good book. It's about the adventures of Harry Potter, who is born a wizard although he's unaware of his special powers. His young years of his life are lived with his annoying relatives, the Dursleys. He must suffer through being treated like a second-class person while his cousin Dudley is pampered. The book kept me reading all the way until the end. There's lots of magic going on throughout the book, with stuff disappearing and levitating and walls opening and dragons. However, there's still an interesting drama in this book. There's a lot of things that appealed to me in this book. I liked how Harry Potter dealt with his new powers. There's a good deal of humor in this book too. The characters are unique and interesting. If you haven't read any Harry Potter books yet, just remember-it's never too late.	2004-01-13

There are so many memorable photos in this book that you have to check it out. There is the amazing photograph of Vince Carter suspended in the air for a dunk.

I read Skipping Christmas and liked it, so I thought this one would be pretty good also. I'm a long-time Grisham fan-I've read all of his previous books. I remember the good old days when I would be mesmerized by books like The Firm, The Rainmaker, and The Client. This book pales in comparison to those legal thrillers.<br />Bleachers is about Neely Crenshaw, a former high school football phenom who was quarterback for the Messina Spartans. Coached by the legendary Eddie Rake, who pushed his players to the limits of physical fitness and production, he led his team to a perfect season in 1987. This book takes us to the future, 15 years later, when he decides to come back to his town because Coach Rake is dying. He embarks on an emotional journey to find his true feelings about Rake. We witness many conversations on bleachers at the Messina football field, and many conversations in general. The book gets boring when they replay their football games. The football stories seem too unrealistic. It also gets confusing when too many characters are introduced and it's difficult to remember the difference between them. There were a few memorable moments and some great characters. I really liked Silo, a menacing and buff linebacker who \\"killed\\" his opponents. This book is a short read, though, so that's pretty good.	2003-10-03

After all, how much information could there be in such a slim book? A smart friend of mine told me that it was a good book that elucidates the technique of writing.<br />I decided to start reading this pithy book and finished reading it in one sitting. The book is easy to read and gives writers many excellent suggestions. It explains some commone grammar mistakes. It shows how a writer should use the active voice. It explains many commonly misused words like effect, lay, nature, and character. Every part of the book was useful, and I enjoyed reading it.

After purchasing this dictionary, I'm confident that I have the definitive source of all the 2-8 letter words that you can play in Scrabble.<br />This book does have some shortcomings, though. Some of the definitions are really weird. For example, when I looked up matilda it said something about a hobo's travelling bag. When I looked up the word in the dictionary the definition was different. The definitions of words are usually quite obscure. If the word can be used as a verb then that form is used. Another thing I don't like about this dictionary is the font of the words. Every word is listed in capital letters only (AARRGH). That makes it harder to memorize. <br />Overall, this is a good book though. This paperback edition is convenient and a bargain. It's portable, perusable, and pliable. There are enough words here to quench the thirst of any word freak. I have already learned some new and interesting words like goliard, otalgia, zyzzyva, and matilda. I frequently peruse this dictionary and there's always a new word to learn. This dictionary has more words than I can handle and it's mind boggling how someone can memorize these words. From the obscure to the archaic, this dictionary will provide you words that will give you an edge in playing Scrabble.	2003-08-12

He gives a brief biography on his life and his upbringing in Leeds, Alabama, where he was poor and had to work hard. <br />There are many interesting anecdotes in this book. Charles talks about race issues and the plight of blacks in this country, and how they need to become more education.<br />There are many funny events that Charles talks about also, and there's a chapter that is talks about how you can't be serious all the time. He also talks about politics, travel, being rich and famous, and being unafraid to speak his mind. Overall, this book is a nice addition to your sports bookshelf.	2003-08-11
US	49909387	R1GI23MC5C8UK	0385508417	999720718	Skipping Christmas	Books	5	2	4	N	N	Short and sweet	Skipping Christmas is a different type of book by John Grisham. It's not about law and there is not one court scene. It's about a small family of three, two parents and a young daughter. The book starts out with the departure of Blair, the daughter of Nora and Luther (the two parents). Blair is going off into the jungles of South America for a goodwill mission.<br />Luther and Nora, the two parents, are dismayed that their beloved daughter is gone into the mysterious jungles. Luther, the father, realizes that this Christmas season will be different. Much different. He gets an idea when he realizes how much stress, money, and pain go into Christmas. Why not skip the whole ordeal. No office party, no gratuitous and unsolicited Christmas cards, and no wasted money on gifts. His plan is to skip Christmas all together, and he tells his plan to his wife.<br />If you haven't ever read a John Grisham book before, this would be a great start. It's a short read, with only 177 pages. The story is wonderful, and the ending is superb. This was also the funniest John Grisham book I've ever read, and I truly enjoyed it. It's similar to &quot;A Painted House&quot; in that it's not about law or the legal genre. That's a refreshing change of style for Grisham, who incorporates a humorous dose of wit and sarcasm in &quot;Skipping Christmas.&quot; This is a great story by John Grisham, and if you haven't read it I suggest you do. The beginning might seem a little slow, but don't worry-the book starts getting really interesting (after Chapter 5). &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; was a great Christmas novel that changed the way I thought about the unique American and Christian tradition.	2003-07-19

There is a chapter called discipline, for example. The names of the chapters are passion, discipline, selflessness, respect, perspective, courage, leadership, responsibility, resilience, and imagination.<br />I really enjoyed this book because of it's easy readability and the wonderful pictures. There were many interesting anecdotes about basketball. Bill Bradley talks about his development as a player, and about the values of the game. The importance of teamwork and hard work is stressed. I found Bill Bradley's story fascinating, because of how the values of the game helped him win. This book related the values to many contemporary and old players, like Julius Erving, Michael Jordan, Steve Kerr, Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, and many others. If you are a basketball fan, I strongly suggest this book.	2003-07-01

It's about Ray Atlee, a law professor from Virginia.<br />He receives a letter from his father, a summons to go home and talk about the estate of his ailing father. When he gets to his father's house, he finds his father dead.<br />Quickly searching through the house, Ray stumbles upon bags of cash. Not one bag, but many bags filled with tightly packed $$$ bills. Many questions arise, and the most pressing is: where did the money come from.<br />Ray soon finds out that someone knows about the money. He found $ million dollars in cash, and someone else knows. The rest of the story is an amazing mystery about the money. Ray learns some surprising things, and the ending is quite possibly the most surprising one I've ever read. The Summons is a fast-passed thriller that has a great plot.	2003-06-18

This book takes you through the basketball career of Tyrone &quot;Muggsy&quot; Bogues. All his life he was shorter than everone on the basketball court. Can you imagine how it's like playing in the NBA when you are on average about 1.5 feet shorter than every one else? That's how Muggsy Bogues has played for his whole life.<br />Yet he persevered and overcame his height. His basketball career was by no means all easy and problem-free, and many people doubted that someone who was 5'3 could play basketball with guys who were 7 foot tall. But in this book Muggsy shows that height doesn't determine whether or not you can play basketball. Heart and skill are what determine how well you play. From his wonderful high school basketball days to his terrible rookie year days in the NBA, the reader sees how Muggsy overcame his height to become a great point guard. His assist and stealing ability proved vital to the success or the Hornets. You have to admire the little fella'.	2003-05-22

The main character of this book is the slob, bum, obese, yet strangely pedantic Ignatius Reilly.<br />Ignatius is the protagonist of the story, and he is the whole mass of the story's bulk. We meet Ignatius in the beginning, described in a language that has yet to be emulated. We hear of his \\"supercilious blue and yellow eyes\\" and his mannerisms. <br />From the beginning the reader will be entranced by this towering giant of a character. And the language that Ignatius uses! It's too good to be true. It's not English really. It's just Ignatius's language. <br />That's one of the best things about this book. The way that the character's talk is one of the hallmarks of this book. It's what sets this apart. This quirky New Orleans story features hilarious depictions of characters in the debauche French Quarter (where Ignatius has many a wild adventure!).<br />I am at a loss with words now, I think my valve is starting to close! If you never read this book, you will soon understand what I mean! I have no more words of wisdom save one: read.	2002-11-09

So I needed a dictionary. I opted for this one because it looked hefty enough. <br />I wasn't disappointed. This dictionary has enough words for any Spanish student. It even has modern words like &quot;digital TV&quot;, &quot;internet&quot;, and &quot;MTV&quot;. It has easy to read print and is durable. <br />Whether you want to browse or seriously study this dictionary is great. Aside from defining the word, examples are given in context. <br />This dictionary also has a very extensive grammar section. This is a very important note. This section has everything you need to know Spanish grammar, which will help you in class much. It has all the common verbs, like hacer, ir, ser, dormir, etc. It also has sections devoted to translation problems, spelling, adjectives, pronouns, etc. <br />I carry this dictionary to class every day. It is invaluable in the moment when you forgot the meaning of a word. And if you know the meaning in English only, you can flip quickly to the English-Spanish section. <br />Some precautionary notes: This dictionary was made in Britain. Some English words are spelled differently from the American way (honour, colour, etc.). It also differs from most American dictionaries in that it contains vulgar words (I won't enumerate them, though). Also, this is a dictionary for Castillian Spanish. It probably won't have some Latin American terms.<br />In conclusion, this dictionary is my new amigo. I was thinking of getting an electronic spanish dictionary, but now I know that this is better. I get to actually see the words and see surrounding ones too. It's an interesting, pithy, concise dictionary. If you need a Spanish dictionary this one won't let you down.	2002-09-18

I already knew what the words meant, save for \\"nictitate\\". All the others I knew. <br />The story itself is mediocre. Some liberal school. Some goofy detective crap. This \\"Novel\\" approach to the SAT really isn't novel. If you want to read something loaded with SAT words try Herman Melville's stories. How about perusing Times or a National Geographic. How about doing it the hard way: memorizing word lists.<br />That's what the SAT verbal comes down to. You have to memorize some obscure terms like circumlocution, pedant, philology, and sarcophagus. Arcane, rarely used lexicon. <br />But there's more than weird vocabulary to the SAT Verbal. The Critical Reading usually doesn't have tough vocabulary. But the Critical Reading is what messes up my score. On a recent SAT verbal I made a 660. Reason? I missed 10 Critical Reading questions. Why? Because it was about irrelevant [stuff]. I really didn't care that day about ugly art or some [guy's] travel log about Bohemia.<br />So what's the solution to the SAT verbal? I would personally say that after knowing your material, attitude plays a big part. Another book that is good for SAT, Up Your Score, says the same.<BR>You have to psyche yourself up so you can be interesting in \\"celery development\\" or \\"the development of the theory of evolution\\". Believe me, it's usually that same boring [stuff]. Never anything interesting. <br />So that makes \\"Tooth and Nail\\" a useless book. All they do is plop some arcane SAT words into a detective story. Most of the words they use are superfluous. Other words would work fine. <BR> <br />So this book failed. I didn't get the score I wanted. It was just a stupid story that I just read because I wanted to know what happened at the end of the phony mystery. What happened? It's silly: they figure out the mystery and the girl and dude smooch.<br />I will never forget the last word of the book though. Nictitate. Not that it will ever be useful though. Just like this book. <br />If you want to do well in SAT verbal, get a practice workbook. Do the practice questions. Do the real thing. It will get you confident and work better. Don't waste 20 hours reading this junk. It's not going to affect your score much.	2002-09-14

In this world you have no privacy. Thinking is a crime. There is no freedom whatsoever.<br />Winston Smith is the main character. He is the readers eye into this world. Luckily for you, he's a very interesting chap. This guy has a diary! That's not illegal, but it's punishable by death. Nothing is illegal. The government is called the Inner Party. These shady guys operate the whole society. The use strange techniques like doublethink. They can change the past.<br />Big Brother is a major theme in this book. He's the scary face watching over everything. There are 4 ministries. The Ministry of Love deals with Hate. The Ministry of Peace deals with War. The Ministry of Plenty deals with the economy. The Ministry of Truth deals with news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts. These are all coined Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv, and Miniplenty.<br />This is a heart-wrenching book. It's very suspenseful. It's also unbelievable in some respects. Telescreens? Can you imagine being watched all the time? In the future it's possible. The unbelievable thing is that the government keeps changing the past. Smith is in this department. All he does is constantly change facts to suit Big Brother's agenda.<br />The end of the book is frightening. If you haven't read 1984 and read everything above, I already gave you the main gist. Does that mean my little review substitutes the book? Of course not. There are many juicy parts I saved for you potential readers. The end is a really cool ending. There's also a little naughtiness, if you know what I mean.<br />Anyway, 1984 is a book that I had to read for school. I was assigned a hundred pages. I thought that was a lot. It turned out that I finished the book ahead of schedule. Enough about me, I want you all to read this book. I think it's a book you shouldn't pass up. It may be the world in the future.	2002-09-11

I thought so myself. I was used to all of the legal thrillers Grisham wrote. It is true that this story has absolutely nothing to do with lawyers. There are no courtrooms. There are no aspiring lawyers like McDeere working for corrupt tax firms (The Firm). There are no judges engaged in letter writing to steal gay's money (The Brethren). <BR>Nevertheless, the story is exciting the pages turn effortlessly. The story is about Luke, a seven year old who aspires to be a Cardinal. Luke is the eye of the story. We see everything through this young boy. Some may think it ridiculous that a seven year old can talk like ... an adult. But why underestimate a seven year old? When I was seven I underwent the feelings he had-worry, fear, and fascination with the opposite sex. <BR>The story starts out on a farm. The Chandlers, Luke's family, must pick cotton. Cotton is their life. Cotton is what is talked about. That and the weather. The story runs along quite nicely. They are in perpetual debt. The Chandler's hire Mexicans and hill people, the Spruills, to pick the cotton. Trouble is brewing quickly. Hank is a big, mean Chandler who quickly establishes himself as the bully. Cowboy is a Mexican who has a knife that has killed many people. Luke fears them both. Luke's passions are ignited when Tally, a seventeen year old girl, allows him to watch her in the buff, bathing. The story's tension is based on secrets. Luke knows secrets that can disrupt and change his way of life. What will happen? I guess you have to read it to find out! I already ruined some of it for you, but hardly anything. There are so many stories in this novel. There's the house painting, the fair, the murder, the scandalous affair, the teenage girl having a baby...	2002-03-17

For example, they say that in order for you to learn a vocabulary word you should \\"staple it onto your goldfish\\". They even say that repeating a word during, ahem, sexual activity makes it easier to remember. I tried this and it works.<br />On a more serious tone I think that it is based on solid information. For example, in order to remember the word crass (meaning stupid), it says: \\"it is crass to scratch your ...\\".<br />Tell me, in which other book does it say something like this. Certainly not Barons, or Princetons Review, or any others. Furthermore, all of the examples from the SAT in this book are bona fide. The problem with other books is that they make up their own problems. The College Board has very expensive facilities and faculties and any examples an author would make is nothing like one made by a myriad of researchers and consultants.<br />In conclusion, this book is great. Why spend hundreds on Princeton courses when a couple of dollars will get you mentally ready. It taught me to hate the test, and to use this hate to foil the tricks on the test, which \\"up\\"ed my score.	2002-01-12
US	49909387	R3VJUNJ6UTSSWU	0801959497	423311503	The Chess of Bobby Fischer	Books	5	7	10	N	N	Thorough	This book is well written. It has fascinating positions where Fischer may or may not be winning material wise. The downside is that the notation is quite antiquate. You have to remember K for King and Kn for Knight. I prefer N for the latter. The algebraic system is better.<br />Notation aside, this is a big book with lots of great games. I think you'll be surprised by the authors work.	2001-11-21

I thought it elucidated the reality of the chess world; one largely ignored (sadly) here. In Russia, where it is very important, chess players are raised meticulously and very thoroughly. Josh Waitzin, the kid on the book cover is a precocious child at the time of writing (and is now a grandmaster at 22). Sadly, his father somewhat chess players in general as queer (because he's a patzer). This is redeemed when he says Josh is very talented at the game, &quot;unearthing ancient strategies&quot; through &quot;trial and error&quot;. Spassky, Karpov, Kasparov, Schiller, and Paldofini are all major chess figures talked about. Bobby Fischer is the one who hold's Fred's interest the most, obviously. He is described as someone slightly deranged, like a ragamuffin. Bobby Fischer's style reflects Josh's too, who is coined &quot;the next Bobby Fischer&quot; by old men who play chess to determine whether they eat or starve in Central Park. Josh is quick to learn the game, eventually beating those who used to beat him. Josh's ratings were as follows 7000-6-1300,7-1400,12-2200(Chessmaster).<br />The language was definitely vivid and jocular too. The parents are portrayed as stressed-out (which is somewhat hard to believe). But it is a great book in the chess tree, one dealing with many sentimental issues between father and son. The main characters are Josh, Bruce Paldofini (portrayed as somewhat shabby, though admitted as hard-working and modest earning), chess pedlers, and Fred (Josh calls his father Fred).	2001-11-13

I was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2:  The Secret of the Ooze. I watched it a lot of times. It was not that realistic. I mean, who believes there could really be Ninja Turtles. But overall I think it was enjoyable. It has some new characters: Toka and Razar. The price here is cheap, and I think kids would like this movie. So why don't you take my advice. Buy this movie if you liked Ninja Turtles 1 (or if you saw it) because the turtles look more real here too.	2001-04-29
US	49909387	RL3371QGAN9FL	0345417623	786105285	Timeline	Books	5	0	1	N	N	I liked it.	This book was pretty cool. I guess you could say I liked it. It was about quantum theory and time travel. The characters were pretty good. I think this book would make a cool movie. There is a plethora of research put into this book. I read this book fast. There were lots of exciting parts in the book. The knights were very brave. I thought one part was funny, too. I think it was Chris. He was on the horse and he was running toward the other guy, and he couldn't see.	2001-03-25
US	49909387	RA3K8UMHDQU3R	0440234743	934400771	The Testament	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Fascinating as myth	I think I honestly liked this book. Nate, a dishonest lawyer, is one character. This is a good story with more than a few tricks in the plot. Buy it. If you be then you can see how good this book is because it isn't that bad.    I'd read it fifty  times and a half. Chapters are interesting; story is well written. It's filled with oxymocrins and contradictions too for you philosophers, and a rant here...and a fish coming out of the river...<br />I don't know what to say about this guy. Five stars says it all.	2001-03-07
US	49909387	R1DNEL4NDZA6FS	0385470819	883917886	A Time to Kill	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Beautiful in both its implications and in its literal style.	First I want to commend to review of the others. I thank them also. They deserve it. But I want to &quot;add to the fire&quot;.<br />The reason I love Grisham is thus: he is not only a regular person but he admits it. Lawyers being parisites. Mafia. Scenes of rednecks throwing glass at an innocent albeit surprised young black girl. <br />The story was excellent. The only reason someone wouldn't like Grishams style is the following: 1. He talks about things we all heard of 2. He uses plain language 3. He is white 4. He is rich 5. His chapters have no titles 6. He shifts alot 7. He cuts off at the end 8. He writes too well<br />Otherwise, Grisham is great. I would give Grisham ten stars &quot;in a jiffy&quot;. He deserves it. I have &quot;The Testament&quot; and I want to read it again. I loved it. I know he writes about controversial things but he shows both sides of the story. In &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; we witness how issues as commonplace in the media as race/being black or white can divide and crush a small, white, albeit unknown Mississippi town and eventually unite the people, make them wonder what is going on. Which is why this book is so great. I read it. If I read a book that means it is good. Beleive me. I don't read much if I don't like what I am reading.<br />On the edge of my seat, eh. Well, the fact is that John Grisham has only two books left. A Painted House and The Brethren. Those are the only two I have not scrutinizingly read. I should read them once I have my hands on my fathers credit card, which will happen hopefully...if I behave and stop writing reviews of books he probably didn't read (that's a good one, eh). <br />Kudos to John Grisham. He built a baseball field and is a philanthropist, evidence that we are not reading the book of someone with a reputation for being rich and stingy. He gives money to causes. He could keep that money. He did not have to do that. He also translated some books into movies, so there's a negative. He also livesin Mississippi and Virginia, I think. All irrelevant information, you reckon. Read on.<br />To conclude this essay on John Grisham's &quot;A Time To Kill&quot; I will say the following: it captivated me in its totality, vitality, and its breadth. I want to read it again.	2001-02-07
US	49909387	R20ZCR04UPLP9W	0345402871	684823314	Airframe	Books	5	0	2	N	N	This book was far out ! It was so cool ! My friend Agrees!	My friend Agrees! Yeah! He's so cool to read that book too. It was a very thoughtful, smart, interesting, and very exciting book. Very very very excellent airplanes! I love airplanes now! I want to go in a plane! This book was very interesting. It was also very smart in both its implications and suggestions and also in its scientific implications. I loved it so much!<br />I would say that there are some few parts of profanity though, unfortunately. That is quite unfortunate. But I really don't mind an authors ability to express himself. There is a certain genre of people that really want to be thrilled, not preached about what not and what to say. I really have no idea what I'm saying. I'll cut the rant.<br />Get the book. Don't get the book. I loved the book. The book rocks. Facts are facts. It is an awesome book. The planes rock. What more is there to say! I really don't know!<br />One thousand words is very generous Amazon.com! I love it though. Amazon.com is great to have these reviews and all the people can write about the books. That is very good. Well, I think I want to wrap this up. Overall, the Airframe story runs along, shall we say, very choppily yet very tasty to the mouth, mind, and to the soul. What I mean is that is lingers in the body even after you read it. Even after the mind understands, the hands and the feet understand. I don't know what I mean, and I know this might have no absolute relevance in this world. But I believe this is a truly exciting, fun, scary!, book. Michael Crichton did a great job. Let us congratulate him and Amazon.com at the same time!<br />Sincerely, Adel	2000-12-29

An immersive and very well written story, and also appealing to our humorous and imaginative senses. This book is fun to read  and most elementary students should be able to grasp it. Along with James  and the Giant Peach and The BFG this book is one of Dahl's best books. It  surely deserves 5 stars.	2000-04-06
US	49909387	R412SHWO8HJD1	0440234743	934400771	The Testament	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Interesting Story	The Testament, overall, is a rather good book but it wasn't as entertaining as the others. You should like this book if you are a Grisham fan, but if you aren't then only if you are a jungle fan you might like  it.<br />Think of The Testament as this: a drunk man who peddals down the  jungle looking for some missionary woman with the Indians. He finds her.  She doesn't want the money. And, as expected, all the legal stuff comes in,  then the end. <br />Be prepared to read this book nonstop for some time,  because that's what usually happens with Grisham books. That is basically  the difference between him and others. His books are entertaining to some  extent. But some people think he doesn't write well, but what is the  definition of &quot;writing well&quot;? Everyone has their own opinions,  but I think his writing is logical and candid, and ultimately that's what  sets him apart. As I said before, everyone is entitled to their opinions.	2000-04-05
US	49909387	R17KAE1CJKO94Q	0345391055	782303291	Disclosure	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Overall an interesting story	I feel that after finishing this book, I can say that it was satisfying but I felt, at the same time, that I am reading something that is a story made from an issue that has two sides.<br />Basically, If you have read other  Chrichton books, you will like this one unless you are technically oriented  and read Chrichton for all the scientifical information. But, from a casual  reading standpoint, this book might be ok.<br />I think that some of the  characters in this book are very believable, and at times, this book seems  like a real story, which means the author is very good when it comes to  story telling.<br />Meredith, the center of all the commotion, seems to me as  a frightening character. I say this because she is so smart and yet excels  business-wise, gaining admiration and also brewing up some rather sneaky  plots herself. I feel that Chrichton brings her into the book very well,  and she fits right into the whole plot.<br />Read this book if you are  interested in the summary that Amazon gives you, but otherwise I think you  might still need to find out what the deal is. And disregard the movie if  you haven't seen it, for I've heard it exaggerates some points. After you  read the book, maybe then think about the movie.	2000-03-28
