A friend in Boston would mail copies of Linda's \\"Ever so Humble\\" columns to me, before they were run online. I miss being able to read Linda's weekly columns, but thankfully, she left us all with two great column/essay collections. The pieces in this book are timeless slices of family life, beautifully written, to be read and savored any time we need to celebrate the comforts of home life -- real home life.	2005-08-03

Difficult, because it is painful to read and rehash how the current generation of mothers takes parenting to the painful point of obsession. Social critics suggest that feminist mothers of my own generation -- baby boomers -- invested more time and energy in building careers as opposed to nurturing our families....So perhaps it shouldn't surprise us to discover that our 'domestic neglect' inspired an over-parenting backlash?  <br /> <br />I've often wondered whether competitive parenting, such as Warner described in her book, is an outgrowth of social or personal guilt. Whatever the cause, I am amazed at the sheer aggression with which today's younger parents approach soccer games, birthday parties, playgroups, and other things that are supposed be recreational. Are we having fun yet? Watching younger families in my neighborhood, I can't say that anyone's really thriving in such an over-booked and frantic climate. (A couple of these young moms are always out of breath. Seriously.) As another reviewer pointed out earlier, you have to wonder if any of the mothers Warner writers about are even remotely enjoying their children. At the risk of waxing sentimental, motherhood CAN have sweet, enjoyable moments. (Ironically, they are usually un-complicated, un-orchestrated moments.) <br /> <br />It will be very interesting to see how today's new mothers deal with the empty nest a few years down the road. Will they be competing for the most interesting midlife crisis while over-managing their kids' college careers? More importantly, what impact will all this over-managing and over-parenting have on the kids when they are out there in the world, on their own?  <br /> <br />At this point, it's hard to pinpoint which is worse -- under-parenting or over-parenting. So, I think it's great that writers are tackling this topic and getting us to talk aboutit. Hopefully, books like \\"Perfect Madess\\" will force us all (women AND men), no matter what stage we are in our parenting lives, to take a long look at what we are doing or not doing for our kids -- and help us return to sanity and balance.	2005-07-26

The Garden Angel was total refreshment from beginning to end. I stayed up all night to finish it, and the well-crafted story deeply resonated. I was moved by the ending. This novel examines the layers of \\"home\\" and what home means to different characters -- interesting, complex, funny, and appealing characters.  Poignant yet humorous in places, it's a delightful piece of literature that deserves the praise it's getting. It is SO MUCH BETTER than other novels out there right now on the NYT list.

While this tender novel is about dealing with grief and the loss of a beloved husband, it is also about change and reinventing yourself at midlife, no matter what your situation. It simply speaks volumes to anyone in this age group.  <br /> <br />Elizabeth Berg is a sensitive and highly skilled writer who avoids falling prey to the ridiculous whims of commerical publishing. Berg refuses to season her story with gratuitous elements or outlandish situations. She relies instead on the poetry and gentle beauty of the ordinary. This is never easy to pull off in a novel -- yet this particular skill of Berg's brings true depth, intelligence, and a touch of domestic magic to \\"The Year of Pleasures.\\"  <br /> <br />After reading just a few pages of the novel, I found myself caring about the fate of the main character. It didn't take long for me to be pulled into her situation. I found myself asking, what would I do if I suddenly found myself in this character's shoes? Could I start over in a new place? I am so grateful that someone recommended this book, as I haven't had much luck finding a good novel centered around a middle-aged woman. I was very disappointed in the over-hyped \\"The Mermaid Chair,\\" but this book rekindled my faith and made me grateful for Elizabeth Berg.	2005-05-03

I think this book is very readable and good, and I enjoyed its mystical approach and other-worldly themes. But I agree with writers who said it didn't have quite the same magic as her first novel. Regardless, Sue Monk Kidd is a superb writer and I would read anything she writes. I'm still a major fan of her nonfiction. It was interesting to note how some of the midlife issues she wrote about in \\"Dance of the Dissident Daughter\\" (which I loved) and \\"When the Heart Waits\\" (which I also loved) were given new wings in this fictional approach.	2005-04-14

Reading a few of these short and wonderfully written essays every evening at bedtime, I got the warm fuzzies and was reminded of the growing pains of my own early motherhood. It's all here -- the joyful, in-your-scrapbook moments as well as the jaw-grinding frustrations of living with a tiny pre-school person.  <br /> <br />Familiar voices in the book include the likes of Louise Erdrich (\\"Blue Jay's Dance\\") and Joyce Maynard, plus countless new writers whose contributions to \\"Mommy Lit\\" are worthy of anthologizing. Editor and author Jennifer Margulis has done a marvelous job of collecting stories that will appeal to all new parents, as well as older ones like me who live vicariously through the well-written chronicles of others.

Is there any role, or any job, on earth that is always easy, always clear-cut, with easy-to-follow directions or guidance?  <br /> <br />Motherhood gets a lot of bashing these days because mother bashing seems to be the cool thing to do. Our culture is very, very confused about anything having to do with home or family.... We seem to have a better handle on how to be corporate than how to be compassionate; we know how to be a boss but not how to be a parent. We can write an annual report, but we can't seem to put together a casserole -- and we love to complain about everything we that we don't understand. Being a parent and running a healthy household take a hell of a lot of work -- but not the kind of work people respect or want to pay for. It will be interesting to see how young people grow up under these circumstances. Most of us don't have a clue. <br /> <br />Books like the Mask of Motherhood don't offer answers -- but at least they open the wound so that it can heal, or at least we can talk about it. That's a good start. Our kids are worth it.	2005-03-21

A bookseller and I agreed last week that Lamott is an acquired taste and more enjoyable if you've read a lot of theology and still find your heart is broken. Lamott reminds us that sanitized piety should not be confused with real faith; that Jesus Himself had radical ideas and didn't sit around worrying about whether our kids are watching PG movies.  <br /> <br />Lamott's personal relationship with Jesus is one she's forged on her own, against all odds, reminding us that faith doesn't always come in an apple-pie/right-wing/Miss-America package. She is a roll-up-your-sleeves-and-get-to-work Christian -- a Christian who knows that it isn't enough to sit around quoting the Bible to be a good human being. Admitting her broken-ness and allowing us to laugh with her, we open our hearts to our own humanity. What a relief.	2005-03-09

We all know the formula doesn't always work -- and See is careful to remind us of the facts. The writing life ain't easy!<br /><br />Furthermore, as See reminds us, getting published isn't always the answer to our dreams. Even if publishing does bring fleeting fame and a little extra cash, our friends and family are often the last to be pleased or impressed. I love the chapter on how to deal with so-called friends who are not supportive of your work as well as people who have trouble figuring out what to say (duh) about your published stuff. See's take on this is pure gold.<br /><br />See shows us how to deal with personal and professional jealousy, sagging book sales, disinterested editors, and uninspiring days. Her book is funny, wise, useful, and very, very real.	2005-02-04

I also love the quoted material from other food writers in praise of preparing good food and dining together. Combined with the very attractive collage graphics and the interesting cover design, the book is fun to look at, too. <br /> <br />The recipes are pretty basic -- as another reviewer pointed out -- and not all that \\"lost\\" if you have at least two or three other basic cookbooks. (If you don't, you will surely welcome these homey recipes. They are worthy of inclusion!) <br /> <br />My biggest complaint is that the art director -- albeit very talented -- is clearly not a person who cooks. The book does not stay open on the kitchen counter -- even cracking the spine doesn't help. You have to weigh down the corners with heavy objects to get the book to stay open to the recipe you are using. That's why I am giving it three stars and not five. <br /> <br />	2005-01-06

For many women today, it is an \\"either or\\" proposition, but I love the way Anne Truitt shows how her domestic life informs and balances her art.

This is indeed a wonderful spiritual memoir, and I cannot get enough of this genre when it's well done!<br /><br />But what I most enjoyed about this book, aside from its lucid and heartfelt writing, is the fact that the author was so honest about her ambivalence toward Catholicism. It was so palpable, right along with her deep yearning to belong. As a lapsed Catholic, she is drawn back to the faith yet she is a thinking seeker, and not totally in agreement with the rules set down by her old patriarchal church.<br /><br />Would she re-join the church or not? Were the Poor Clares the catalyst she needed to find the faith again? Or not? This conflict creates a marvelous spiritual tension throughout the book -- and that is what kept me reading until I finished.	2004-09-07

It takes place in one day, as the bride and groom and their families gather in the bride's home for the ceremony and reception. It is not sugar-coated. Here is a realistic view of the pains and pleasures of this complicated sacrament we call marriage. I couldn't put the book down and read it start to finish in one night. I sensed Lindbergh's own conflicts about her difficult marriage to her famous husband, plus her feminist philosophies glimmer throughout the stories and are remarkably ahead of their time. (This novel was written in the 1960s.) It was moving, sad, wise, inspiring, uplifting, infuriating and more -- like marriage itself -- and should be read by anyone who's newly engaged or even thinking about getting married.	2004-08-01

We need real mentors and ongoing friendships with seasoned women who can show us the way. <br />At some point in midlife, many women (and men) experience a career crisis or crisis of faith, and are desperately in need of guidance. Joan Anderson was lucky enough to find an incredible mentor to show the way, demonstrating how &quot;elderly&quot; friends are essential to our growth.<br />I believe many of us remain stuck with only peer relationships, and don't take time to seek out the untapped wisdom of older people in our communities and congregations. Joan's book is a marvelous blueprint for anyone who craves companionship with the older and wiser -- or women of experience. <br />As we read this sweet book, we are also called to treasure -- or initiate -- friendships with real women of experience in our midst.

If only everyone could take the time to read his work, or listen to his tapes, we'd all be better people.<br />DARK NIGHTS OF THE SOUL is especially needed in these times of quick-fix therapy and entertainment as anti-depressant. We need to accept the fact that tough times and dark episodes in our lives must be dealt with and honored, not medicated or pushed under the rug. Dark nights offer potential for growth, for soul expansion, and Thomas Moore is the one to lead us on this important journey.<br />If you enjoyed his earlier work, you will appreciate his latest effort, and no doubt, will notice that he too is growing as a writer and giving us more to think about. Don't overlook this one.	2004-06-01

Where was this book when I needed it years ago, as a younger woman who spent way too much on cosmetics that did more harm than good, physically and emotionally?  Why do women waste so much money on so-called dreams that don't come true? <br />THE TRUTH ABOUT BEAUTY is well-written, informative, and totally sane -- the author strikes an admirable balance between new-age enthusiasm for organic products and her (well-researched) distrust of the pharmaceutical industry.<br />Her book encouraged me and inspired me to go through my food cabinet as well as my medicine chest and cosmetics cases. I have since tossed out the tainted products I'd been hoarding and began to replace them with many of the healthy foods and cosmetics Kat suggests. (Her resource section is amazingly helpful if you can't find the items at your local Whole Foods Market or health food store, they are available online and she gives you the Web addresses!) I have been keeping track of the changes in my looks and my moods -- and they are indeed remarkable. Plus, I have a lot more space in my bathroom.<br />Best of all, her work is a wonderful companion to that of Dr. Christiane Northrup, whose work I also admire, as well as that of Dr. Weil and others in the complimentary medicine fields.<br />Again, Thank you, thank you. This IS the truth about beauty. I would love to see more books like this !!	2004-05-24

Loved it! And thanks to Myrna for validating my feelings about women's magazines. After so many years of reading these things, women start to feel as if they never measure up to the celebrities on the cover (whose lives are usually a mess behind the scenes, anyway). These magazines are driven by product advertising, ladies, and the more we remind ourselves of this fact, the less we'll be sucked in by their trends and the not-so-subtle message that we need to be &quot;fixed&quot; and made over! Thank you, thank you for this book!	2004-03-06

It would be wonderful to read aloud for small church or retreat groups having a Communion service, what with its imagery of baking, breaking, and &quot;being&quot; bread together. It talks about transformation (in baking) and the pain of waiting and becoming, with allusions to Christ in us. What a clever metaphor and comforting, accessible book for all faiths.	2004-02-12

This book fills a need for the everyday fashionista who loves to read intelligent copy about clothes, especially the classics already in her closet. The author knows her subject and her affection is contagious.<br />There's nothing much new here, but still, it's loads of fun to rehash. Reading these essays, I had a vague sense that I'd read some of the material in several other places by several other authors -- such is the familiarity of the Little Black Dress, for example. (Everyone wants to own the LBD and every fashion writer in America has written about it. Ditto the trench coat.)<br />But don't let that spoil the fun and romance of this delightfully fun read!  It's a great little tribute to the classics, and deserves a place on your nightstand.	2004-02-03

If you love clothes and historic fashion, don't waste a minute asking yourself if you need this book. You'll love it, and you won't be sorry. If you can't afford it, put it at the top of your holiday wish list.  <br />Filled with details of beautifully preserved and displayed clothing and fashion artifacts, plus companion paintings from all periods, this book is a feast for fashionistas. Costumers, designers, and everyone who appreciates beautiful clothing won't be able to put it down. The book is huge and every page an inspiration.	2003-11-13

I had hoped to see more fashion than what was included. In a recent fashion magazine tribute, for example, there were several pieces of wonderful fashion from the archives -- a military jacket, tuxedo jacket, etc -- that epitomized the Lauren style. This sort of thing was sorely lacking in this book. Just not enough of a good thing, and not as lush as you'd expect.	2003-11-12

I've owned this book for nearly 5 years, and my hardcover edition is marked up, highlighted, and truly loved!  I have followed Simple Abundance for many seasons, and always seem to find something new in it whenever I pick it up again. <br />When I first bought it, I picked it up in the middle of the year and followed it daily. Now, I use it randomly -- and it still \\"speaks\\" to my heart and mind. I can't thank Sarah enough for giving me permission to enjoy my home, and, well, my life as a woman. She has introduced me to many wonderful authors that I would NOT have found without her guidance.  In fact, many of the books I've purchased here on amazon.com, have been introduced to me in Simple Abundance. <br />This is a wonderful path. The encouragement in these pages is life-affirming, and I would LOVE to see a beautiful 10th Anniversary edition to replace my well-worn and well-read copy!	2003-09-16

Having been raised by one of the first working mothers in the 1970s, I didn't learn all the skills of homecaring, or the little niceties that make like more enjoyable and beautiful for myself and my family.  Like one of the guys, I was sent out into the world of business and expected to compete there. I did, but I was miserable and felt something was missing from life.<br />A good friend gave me this book as a gift -- and what a perfect gift it was, at the time I most needed it. Yes, the ideas are simple, and perhaps, to some, this whole domestic goddess thing can be &quot;syrupy&quot; as one reviewer put it. So sue me -- but I love being at home, love rediscovering what it's like to live like a human being, not a &quot;human doing&quot;, and to make my home a place of beauty. I love this book, and plan to give it to other women like myself, and I will be looking for more like it!	2003-09-04

At first, I wondered if this would be another lightweight book praising the mythical French Woman and how she can tie a scarf. Mais non. It is one of the best self-help books, for American women in general, that I have ever read. Getting below the surface of cosmetics and clothes (though these ARE important), the author highlights the intellect of the French woman, and how this sets her apart from the American woman.<br />There is SO much more to the French Paradox. We Americans are FAR more addicted to appearances and the surface of things; we do not take time to get as deep as our European sisters. We think that if we look good and are &quot;physically fit and thin&quot; we have done our work.<br />This book shows us that French &quot;style&quot; begins in the mind and not on the body. Merci!!	2003-08-27

I have spent years exploring both Catholic and Protestant faiths, trying to figure out which path will help me reach the religious life I desire but have been missing. Neither practice has worked for me, despite my intense efforts and study -- and good intentions and faith. <br />This book helped me pinpoint what was bothering me (and hurting) for ages, but like many women expressed here, could not quite figure out. Both Protestant and Catholic traditions left me feeling like something was missing, and that something was WRONG with ME. It has been so painful.<br />Thank you, Sue Monk Kidd, for helping me discover why I've felt like I was on the other side of a huge wall, trying to reach God and not finding Her/Him.

Best of all, as a homemaker who loves the domestic arts, I think Browning strikes just the right tone of love and yearning for home. <br />Most of us are too busy these days to spend all the time we'd like creating a home and garden, or nurturing a young family. Browning hones in on these desires and serves up poignant pieces everyone can relate to -- even if we're not divorced or uprooted. I would love to see more of her work (yes, I subscribe to her magazine just to read her essays) in book form!	2003-06-24

The author clearly knows how to speak to Christian women who are also &quot;thinking women&quot; in all walks of life. Her reading and movie suggestions are also right on target for her audience.  What a gift to read this. I am buying copies for my women friends.	2003-01-09

First, the writing is both excellent and entertaining; I found the book hard to put down.<br />Additionally, the authors also offer some good tips -- laced throughout the text -- on HOW TO WEAR some of this old stuff. As much as I love vintage fashion, and have collected it for several years, I am often at a loss as to how to WEAR some of the pieces, or how to incorporate my vintage &quot;finds&quot; into my real-life wardrobe. So far, few books actually address this issue, and tend to focus instead on buying, selling or simply &quot;collecting&quot; vintage fashion.<br />This book is thorough and carefully put together -- like a great outfit. I hope the authors write more on this topic, and maybe put together a how-to guide to vintage fashion.<br />Kudos!	2002-11-28

(I have been re-reading SIMPLE ABUNDANCE for a while now!). ROMANCING the Ordinary is lovely to look at and the essays are pure SB -- comforting and informative, as always. <br />One of the things that made &quot;SA&quot; so helpful and appealing was its daily entries. While &quot;Romancing the Ordinary&quot; is divided into 12 months, there are no daily entries -- so you simply read the essays for that month as you see fit. I am not sure why the publisher didn't encourage Sarah to make an essay for each day of the year, just as she did for &quot;SA&quot;. For that reason alone, I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5.<br />However, I do love the concept of day books, and I think women need them more than ever now that life is so busy, and often fraught with conflict. Writers like Sarah give us comfort and advice, and permission to enjoy and savor life instead of merely rushing through it. Sarah gives us old wisdom, new thought, and some wonderful quotations along the way. We need more of this!	2002-11-15

A book like this doesn't ask to be taken TOO seriously, so I didn't -- and I truly enjoyed it. The author is obviously interested in the &quot;mythology&quot; of the French -- as well as their passion for beauty, art, good food, and the pleasures of living well.<br />There are some interesing bits of history laced throughout the text, including stories of infamous femme fatales, which made it fun to read. (I am not sure how well-researched these were, or where they came from, as there is little documentation here.)The way I read it, the book is more or less a long, entertaining essay on the allure of French women -- not an historic treatise and certainly not an insult to American women. The author herself is clearly writing as an American, with American perspective.<br />With so few books available on this topic, I found this one a pleasant diversion.	2002-11-15

As you'd expect from Rodale Press, the tips included for beauty, health, and well-being are reasonable and accessible for most women in this age group. Specific product names (for cosmetics) are mentioned, too, which is a plus in this sort of beauty book -- and most of the products are affordable for most women, and even available at the drugstore.<br />That said, I have to mention that I felt somewhat disappointed (perhaps even misled) by the glossy full-color promotional material that was sent to me before I purchased the book. The lovely color photos in the promotional booklet (showing real middle-aged women and health foods) led me to think that the book itself would be loaded with gorgeous color photos and features similar to the promo material. Not so.<br />So -- I'd advise devoted readers of beauty books to note that this book is illustrated with sketches and line drawings -- NOT full color illustrations. Regardless, the book is still attrative, handy, and useful for anyone who feels &quot;stuck&quot; in their younger beauty routines and wants some fresh ideas appropriate to her age.	2002-01-21

This one is the best to date. It is well-researched, authoritative, and packed with useful information for the sharp consumer who wants to look her best. <br />Most books of this type merely scratch the surface, but this one goes deeper and delivers even more than what it promises. Workman's books are always works of art, and this one is no exception. Thanks for an intelligent beauty book that requires more than an evening to explore! Wish more beauty books were like this one, but we don't need more after this one (other than an updated edition, hopefully, when the future calls for it!)	2001-12-22

Once in a while, someone comes along and writes the book that touches your soul. For me, reading A SABBATH LIFE was like holding a mirror to my late 30s and early 40s -- a time when I was struggling to find what it means to be a successful woman, wife, and mother. Those were confusing years for me. <br />A SABBATH LIFE opens the door to a new way of living (and thinking) for intelligent women who want to slow down long enough to enjoy motherhood, community, and the sheer beauty of &quot;ordinary&quot; living. Yet it is not a backlash book. <br />Hirsch assures us, through this healing memoir, that it's possible to live &quot;whole&quot; lives without totally turning our backs on the feminist victories we've won. But we need to rethink and revise our culture's definition of success. In so doing, we just might find the spiritual strength and integrity we've been seeking for so long.<br />Bravo and thanks to the author!  I plan to share this deliciously poetic book with everyone I know, men included.	2001-04-19

This is the first book on vintage clothing that doesn't aim to help make you look like you're an extra in a period movie. (Not that there's anything really wrong with that, but...). This is for fashion buffs who want to incorporate vintage pieces successfully into their existing wardrobes and thereby create a truly individual style for themselves.<br />I loved the way the book inspired me to re-examine the clothing I already own, and how vintage pieces -- classic pieces -- might add new life to my wardrobe. The key word here is &quot;classic&quot;, and this book goes a long way toward defining it.<br />In addition to this book, I own several others on vintage clothing. Most of those books merely chronicle the various eras and styles of clothing, plus include price ranges for collectors. VINTAGE STYLE, on the other hand, shows how you can wear the clothes, not merely accumulate them. <br />My only wish is that the authors had included a lot more on vintage accessories -- say, costume jewelry (charm bracelets); handbags; shoes; etc. But this was a fine step in the right direction, and I'd love to see more books like this! Hopefully, the authors are planning another edition!	2001-02-15
