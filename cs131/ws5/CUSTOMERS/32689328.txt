The verse on each card is roiling with restless life, & the illustrations prove to be an important part of the conceptuality (as well as the aesthetic beauty) that runs throughout the deck!  The possibilities posited by poetry in deck form are interesting; the juxtapositions presented by this deck are powerful, & Encke's supple language itself never fails to be new & encouraging to the lexus of contemporary poetics.  A strong & ambitious voice is beginning to emerge here.	2004-12-03

Her music here is completely melodious &amp; unfaltering.  Her metaphors are staggeringly incisive.  Her themes &amp; subjects are so expansive, so complex!  Someone once told me she didn't like Sylvia Plath since Sylvia Plath was just a victim of herself, but that's not the reason for her fame, just another facet of the intensity of her mind.  This book is absolutely incredible poetry.	2004-07-16

No one but Louise Gluck could ever have written this beautiful, crystal clear little book of masterful verse.

This through his humility shines all the more resplendantly.  He is a poet who is very easy to relate to in comfortable ways; reading this book you might feel like these poems are a conversation you're having over tea with him about the themes of this book.

It's amazing how she can write this way -- immediately accessible &amp; still syntactically, linguistically, poetically, wholly innovative.  Everything she writes by now is controversial, but never doubt her mastery.  She revises her poems so many times people would be appalled, making sure that every bit of the music of her poems is exactly as she wants &amp; that she has said &amp; laid out everything she wants to say exactly.  These poems are bursts of physical substance, love, passion, &amp; barrages of insight.  They move just like universes exploding out of universes.  They don't whizz by in a blur, but catch all over.  This is a collection of instances that adhere to true devotion, starting with a prayer.<br />I hope this review has been helpful to you.	2004-04-26

Linda Gregorson moves deeply into the heart &amp; mind where embrace becomes faith, completely unflinching, but not religious.  She's always very aware of the reader in these poems, to the point of bringing this to the forefront &amp; making the reader a deeply emotionally connected character, making it clear that the reader is who she is addressing, not her daughter, in a poem that says \\"Have I told you - do you know for yourself - how the sweetness of creation may be summed up by the lightfall on a young girl's cheek?\\"<br />Throughout the book she gives her thoughts &amp; feelings to the reader as alpine air gives dew to grass.  &amp; how she gives the music.  These poems resonate with music that is the spine of poetic music, constantly - in the spine of the stanzas, the middle line in stanzas of 3 - reducing themselves to unimeter or sometimes even reducing to a single syllable, as her masterfully, brilliantly crafted free-verse seems to come from a clean foundation of the iamb but more recently the musical independence of the solitary syllable.<br />This book also holds very powerful themes in the way that one thoughtfully holds one's robe in pre-dawn mist.  Here are classic &amp; personal themes &amp; one very moving poem communicating human rights violations, which are a thing that in this world must be addressed with poetry &amp; everyday life.  Linda Gregerson does not shy from or ever stumble in trying to reach what she has to say.  Linda Gregerson says exactly what she has to say.	2004-03-12

I've already written another review of this book, but I'll have to keep making more notes in reviews as I come to understand it more.  I won't understand it all.  We live in an age of such chaos, &amp; in this book Carolyn Forche responds to it how a body grows bones with forms of stern order.  With the forms of these poems it seems to me that she's positing that underneath any modern chaos is a ruling order, from the long end-stopped lines at the beginning of the book, like the end-stopped lines at the historical beginnings of western poetry, to the 40+ pg single poem with all its lines arranged alphabetically.  In a short poem the notes at the end of the book reveal to be about the contaminated land about Chernobyl, in the context of the motions of the whole book, she makes me feel as though perhaps while one can only surrender to change, what is manifest not lasting, this is not an impetus into disorder &amp; what will come is new sense.<br />Anyways, Carolyn Forche is a wild poet.  This incredible book is a very exciting creative advance from her earlier work.  Metasticizing cities -- she moves like a platoon.	2003-11-21

She has ideas.  Big different ideas.  In this book, with her unique language with its broken syntax &amp; emerging insights, she explores an operatic form, a vision in 5 parts.

Also the Inferno has more shoot-em-up sort of action than the other 2, Purgatorio &amp; Paradiso.  Purgatory is of such poetic brilliance; it's full of poetic philosophy from Dante's critical genius, &amp; beautiful scenes, interesting spirits -- a feeling wholly different from the grimness of the Inferno.  &amp; W. S. Merwin too is brilliant &amp; masterful enough for a repartee with the medieval guru.  Merwin is a poet &amp; translator whose verbal &amp; syntactical decisions you can trust.  He renders Purgatorio with great exciting faithfulness to Dante's original language, with mellifluous music, with merit worthy of the high praise this has gotten from Robert Pinsky, Harold Bloom, &amp; others.  The Comedy is notoriously difficult to translate, &amp; this is one of the best translations of Purgatorio into English ever, I'm sure.	2003-08-04

Cursively written, too, with pertinent quotes at the beginning of each chapter.  I even laughed out loud a number of times reading this book, because it's just so fun to read!  I have one small complaint, which can be expected of any printed book about the internet.  The internet-publishing chapter of this book I think is way out of date.  My only other complaint is more about what I didn't know about the book before reading it than the book itself.  It's especially about British publishing, which means that a lot of information in it is directly relevant to poets in England an, for me as an American, is only indirectly useful.<br />I hope this review has been helpful to you.	2003-05-03

It's all very exciting.  You know by now from what else you've read of heard about this book that it's all footnotes to an elided text, as poetry is the footnotes to a great unknown above us.  The footnotes flow from the mysterious text, not from one another, so there's never any knowing what will happen next.  Things open, &amp; don't resolve.  Instead, there's more opening.  Another major stylistic decision of hers is that she eschews the post-Eliot evasive techniques so prevalent in modern poetry, directly communicating all these interesting thoughts &amp; situations, metaphorical &amp; otherwise, though this marvelously unique language.  So it is an innovative book all around.  I wonder what tdhe next book she publishes will be like.  I foresee an exciting career ahead of her.	2003-05-01

He is a very feeling person, a poet of feeling & great genius.  He addresses all sorts of themes in these poems.  All sorts, from the serenely bucolic [he sometimes begins poems by showing the reader that he's been sure to learn things about what he uses for images) to overtly sexual experiments that he says in the poem make you feel dirty.  In one he muses about philosophy in general, which he declares as a poet is not his field, not quite, as nothing can stop the poet from thinking (no matter how much exile that means, I must add)but the thinking of poetry is be for poetry.<br />He is a very important poet.  He was honored with the distinction of U.S. poet laureate three times in a row -- the first ever to be three times in a row -- because he's done more work for the vitality of poetry than almost any other person alive, matched or nearly matched by very few.  In his scholarship, he studies everything so intently.  In his writing, he channels the world through an equally unsparing dedication to mastery.	2003-05-01

Read any book of essays that includes 20th century poetry; that poem is talked about in it.  But I don't mean to be reviewing as though T. S. Eliot was a man of one poem; he was a writer of such severe genius throughout his career that poetry since him has all been in his shadow.  Within 10 years of his career, he had had a profounder influence on poetry as we know it than anybody else.  Writer of incredibly dense poems, one might argue that with his wild &amp; totally new ideas about he was the godfather of language poetry, but he was also had a fierce love for tradition, in his self-exile from the U.S. to England.	2003-04-19

The sounds of poetry were one of the most important aspects of western poetry before Homer, when the sounds were integral pnemonics for poems to be remembered by many people in many places for long times.

Poetics run deep, &amp; with poetry so much is invested in the sounds.  This is absolutely the best resource I know for a student of poetry to begin to develop an ear for poetry.

Or aren't many.  Some of the writing is pretty interesting.  It's so saturated with quotes from other fancy books he's read that it's hard to tell sometimes what's a quote &amp; what's his own writing.

Her quiet humor is exemplified in the beginning of her Nobel acceotance speech.  &quot;They say that the first sentence of any speech is always the hardest.  Well, that one's behind me.&quot;  After that, for the rest of this book, her poems are very concise &amp; wonderfully thoughtful.  Lucid.  This is welcoming poetry.	2003-04-10

Don't be fooled.  Her books since since The Dream of the Unified Field have each been major achievements for the poet &amp; significantly innovative for poetry; this book contains many of her most important earlier works &amp; shows the immense development in the first 5 books of a poet for whom each book is a critical examination &amp; leap beyond everything she has done before.  This poetry is really intense.  More &amp; more, every poem is so monumental.  Her mastery is undisputed.  Her visionary brilliance is evident.  Every creative product of hers is very major; this is perhaps the book that will be her most lasting since this is the one she got the Pulitzer Prize for.	2003-04-07

But that's hardly what this book is about.  Sort of a step down in difficultness from her previous book, The End of Beauty -- but still difficult &amp; also beautiful conceptually, emotionally, musically, in a modern way....  This book also has some of the most important poems of her career, &amp; a lot of very interesting experiments that didn't get into her selected poems.  For me, honestly, not a favorite Jorie Graham book, but a good one.  At the time of this review, the only other review rated this 4 stars.

This book won't give you an idea of all the other amazing developments she's had in her career, for herself &amp; for western poetry, but it is a showcase for her brilliant mind for metaphor &amp; the sounds of poetry among other things.

This is a book of thoughts; he prefers the word in a conceptual space over the word as image.  He also has a crazy sense of humor.  Sections of this long poem are sectioned into very small units, & the form of 2-line stanzas is almost (but not quite) constanr throughout the book.  The poems move as you would imagine the sphere on the cover would roll -- with a steady, hard arcing sound.  I don't know this for sure yet, but I have a feeling Ammons liked associating his poetry with spheres so much because spheres are the shapes with the greatest surface area to volume ratio, & his words are just as voluminous in their terseness.  In other news, his poetry in this book is its own very exciting avant-garde.  Until his death on 25 Feb, 2001, more & more throughout his life, he was always creating wholly new spaces for poetry to move through.  This his last book keeps moving.	2003-04-05

It's not as if the selected poems is the only worthwhile writing of his.  The sounds of this book are intense, so great; from the beginning all the way though, he has a powerful ear.  & the thoughts & poetry his mind offers in this book are so crazy.  It often flirts with nature poetry, but it is not nature poetry (don't worry).  It's very modern.  It's smart, & pretty carefree, also with some autobiographical little poems & Australian mythology.  I learned that some of these are autobiographical from a reading of his I attended recently.  These poems are, in fact, even much cooler than I was able to tell at the reading.

This book is so different from her previous book of poems, The Angel of History.  That was compact to such an extreme.  Her poems looked like usual-sized poems, but the language felt so compressed by her genius in such ingenius ways.  Here, the poems are sprawling, with an ambitious Whitman influence marked by long end-stopped lines.  One of my favorite moments of the book is actually a John Cage quote, \\"Everything in the world has a spirit released by its sound.\\"  & of course this books incredible 40+ page poem, On Earth, about what the mind experiences in the moments preceeding death.  The introduction part of the poem ends \\"open the book of what happened\\".  After that, for the the whole 40+pages of it, the lines are all in alphabetical order.  & they're each incredibly, beautifully brilliant.  A masterwork for the 21st century, yes.  The feeling of speed beneath all of her poems is accentuated among other places in the lack of capital letters in any of her poetry, as if even after periods the language is part of the same rushing sentence.  & her language otherwise too is very resourceful.  Very resourceful, so many very deliberate & wholly unique coices in every bit of  its promethean syntax.<br />Allow me to post the final poem of the book, in which her exacting, huge brilliance is in full force (as always...) & means so much to me as a poet & person.  One of her few very short poems, it's hanging on my wall.<br />Afterdeath<br />...	2003-03-25
