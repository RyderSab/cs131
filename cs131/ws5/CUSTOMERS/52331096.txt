Back then when something was wrong the radio could lay hands on you and you'd be all right;\\"      -- neither his wife (or wives, numbers aren't clear to me) nor children seem to have names;    -- seeing Gorgeous George in a hotel lobby at a low performing point buoyed him;    -- lots of creative tension between him and Daniel Lanois on Oh, Mercy (my editorial comment: a damn fine album I've also reviewed here) leads a decade later to reuniting for the brilliant Time Out of Mind, and Dylan generously recognizes Lanois' key contributions;     -- he hated the famous Ronnie Gilbert \\"Take him, he's yours\\" introduction at Newport (currently one of the sound bites at the EMP Dylan exhibit in Seattle);    -- he never had any doubt at all about his destiny;    -- Three Penny Opera and, particularly, Pirate Jenny influenced his music as profoundly as Woody Guthrie and Robert Johnson.    All that and a whole lot more we learn in Chronicles as Bob rambles in no chronological or any other order through some acts in his life and career.    But since Bob is always Bob, whether these glimpses or anything else in the book are conventionally \\"true\\" or not is a whole different question.  At a minimum say this: Bob entertains as well on the written page as he does in The Neverending Concert Tour.	2005-05-27

To know that outcome increases the frustration and the spasm of anger at her -- how could she so exquisitely detail the joy she found in living over the last decade and a half of her life, and then one day slam the door on those joys through, I understand, an overdose of sleeping pills and a plastic bag around the head for good measure.  The clue must lie in this book's last essay, On Mortality, and what Heilbrun seems to fear and foresee in that chapter, that at some increasing age indifference to life succeeds pleasure in life.     Obviously a woman of strong views -- I was not familiar with any of her writing before Gift --, Heilbrun is never shy about expressing those views, but does so with a humor and civility too often missing in writing and intellectual debate.  She has scores to settle, but often, in these essays, matters of more compelling interest: a faithful dog; the fairly nondescript house she buys in the country; her enthusiam for email and England.      In the end I come away from Gift with two strong feelings,  pleasure at being able to still enjoy some of those pleasures that Heilbrun enjoyed and an unsettling inability to understand why she later chose to stop doing so.    Recommended.	2005-05-16

I was telling a friend who was once my English professor at Cal Berkeley that Seeing was the best novel I'd read in a long time.  (Unfortunately, there is currently little time for novel reading.)  She asked, \\"Good book or good read?\\"  I sort of went \\"Huh,\\" but have been mulling over the question ever since.  The answer:  good read, emphatically.  Swift, short and constantly entertaining in its transitions of place and time, and overlay of memory, Seeing is a true page-turner.  Good book?  I think the answer here is also yes.  Derbyshire, who I presume from his name to be a Caucasian, does a pretty convincing job as an Asian narrator, even capturing Chai's reflexive smugness toward women, particularly his wife Ding.  The pitch for the rehabilitation of Calvin Coolidge does not convince me; he still seems a simple man for simpler times whose values are of a more limited guidance than the author implicitly argues.  At the same time, the observations on China, particularly the excesses of the Red Guard, and on a self-absorbed and often frivolous America as seen through a recent, successful immigrant's eyes ring very true.  And you can't help but enjoy Ding's wiles as she brings Chai to live Coolidge's maxims. <br /> <br />	2005-04-20

And even if they're cliches because they're true, that's no excuse to write a 300 plus page novel about them.  Will is whiny, perfectly matched with an equally whiny wife.  Joel is stuck on the past and seeing dead people, though much less entertainingly than the little boy in the Sixth Sense.  Will gets his comeuppance and Joel, mightily effective in his infrequent sexual activity, gets a life.  For his next novel, I would like to see James Kaplan aim his sardonic satirical talents at targets that are a little less broad than the side of a barn.

Nafisi can be annoyingly self-absorbed.  I also don't believe for a moment that she can remember years after the fact exact details of the furnishing of a room or the way the sun and breeze felt on her face in 1981.  And though you would have to be an idiot not to appreciate her need to protect the identities of many of the people she discusses in the text, I did wonder to what extent she is creating characters who are nearly as fictional as the ones -- Gatsby, Lolita, Emma, et al -- her \\"girls\\" meet to discuss once a week in Tehran.  In short, as the best fiction does, she is creating -- or recreating -- a world.  Yet none of those concerns -- even if valid -- much diminish what she has achieved.  For in this well-subtitled \\"memoir in books,\\" Nafisi does nothing less than prove once again, through her account of women and a few men keeping imagination and literary argument alive in Tehran, that the human spirit is indomitable and that totalitarian efforts to stifle the thrill of creativity and critical thought are always and everywhere doomed to fail.  It is simply a matter of how long it takes.  It is hard to come away from Reading without believing that sooner or later Iran will regain -- or perhaps gain for the first time -- its full freedom.   For that encouraging accomplishment alone, Nafisi's memoir deserves reading.	2004-12-30

But despite the great pains the author takes in the introductory chapter to tell us how many miles he traveled in researching it, for anyone -- like me -- who has looked into the subject a little Choose a College Town will feel slim and superficial, with a decided tilt toward the places -- Santa Cruz and Bennington, VT, e.g -- that the author already knows well.

Even so, I found these quick essays on 31 pop songs to be a bit repetitive, often coming down to the simple themes of \\"when living in the UK and listening to BBC radio was awful, Song X made it a little more tolerable,\\" and \\"when I was suffering pain in my personal life, Song X made it a little more comprehensible if not tolerable.\\"  Every reader will have his pet peeves with Hornby's selections.  Here's mine:  even though he picked a great obscure Dylan song (Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?) he respects Dylan too little and Jackson Browne way too much.  Also, I only got two new hot tips -- Teenage Fan Club and Badly Drawn Boy.  I will definitely give him this, however; he is absolutely right about the fun of having a friend or friends with whom you can take turns introducing each other to exciting new music all your life.  <br /> <br />I thought the essays on albums, particular Steve Earle and Hornby's experience listening to the Top Ten albums on Billboard's Hot 100, more developed and interesting than the quick takes on the singles.	2004-09-07

The best sections of the novel are the moments of the dogs' arrival, when the narrator hears their helicopter passing overhead and writes of that moment just before the moment when all that is known before changes irrevocably, and of her first meeting with Ludwig, the dog historian.  But the deeper I at least got into the novel, the less sustainable the conceit became.  Time and again as she was having a conversation with Ludwig, or Lydia or the Klaue, the dog spinmeister and Svengali, I found myself thinking more and more, \\"she's talking with and to a dog\\" and unfortunately, the dog sounded more and more like just another human character who in the novel's context had been indentified as a dog.  And the love angle just doesn't work at all for me.  Still, this is a fairly enjoyable read.  Just be prepared to suspend your disbelief far more than usual when entering a novel.	2004-08-13

A Wright Brothers biography?  No.  A personal memoir?  Not really.  A Wright Brothers Greatest Hits visit to places intimately connected with their lives?  Not that either, although The Flyers certainly has some characteristics of all those three possibilities.  While well-written, the book fails to capture the brothers, not really a surprising flaw since they are long dead, their contemporaries are long dead and the Brothers didn't leave much in the way of a written account of their lives.  The characters who come most back to life here are their father Bishop Wright and, especially, their lovely and patient sister Katharine.  And they breathe on the page precisely because Adams draws frequently and well from their journals and letters.  Adams is also good when writing of the places the Wright Brothers flew, such as the Outer Banks of North Carolina and New York.  Each chapter starts with a title page photograph and many of them are rare treasures, at least as evocative as Adams's text.  One minor annoyance -- the Wrights were famously solitary and family-centered, so the frequent interludes where Adams imagines himself exchanging small talk and daily observations with the Wilbur and Orville ring jarringly untrue.	2004-06-19

O'Connor's grammatical medicine is particularly painless and great entertainment thanks to the sentences that illustrate the rules of usage.  Just opening the book at random here, I find her giving &quot;paradigm&quot; a thoroughly deserved debunking (a &quot;pattern or example,&quot; not &quot;a standard of perfection&quot;), &quot;...the darling of those who like to dress up ordinary ideas in technicalities.

In this one, which reads throughout like thinly disguised autobiography, he retraces places of his parents' marriage.  The story is told mostly in flashback as he visits his dying father in the ramshackle Irish hometown and broken down house where he grew up.  Mom (Mam) has long since and wisely fled for parts unknown and based on the description of the old man here it's hard to tell what she saw in him.  Intoxicated by his craft and his mastery of words, McCann rarely lets the story tell itself.  Once he learns to rein in his tendency to pose on the page, I suspect he'll be fine.  Check out his later work to find out, but you can miss Songdogs.	2004-01-05

Alexander and Lazell hope, but are hardly convinced, that nature will get the chance to run its long course.  Beyond the fascinating subject, the authors' chapter by chapter analysis of the forces that compete on the Banks -- sand, wind, land, forest -- is a clarifying approach to writing about the science of the Banks.  In separate chapters, Alexander and Lazell then effectively show how the forces combined to impact Blackbeard's last battle and the Wright Brothers efforts to fly.  The final chapter, Convergences, is like reading a decade-early preview of the impact on the islands of Hurricane Isabel.  I would call Alexander and Lazell prescient, but I suspect they themselves would be the first to admit they were simply documenting the inevitable future.  Only problem with this excellent book is that the writing feels as if it was done either in turn or by compromise, and is often far less compelling than its subject matter.  Still, Ribbon of Sand offers some science, some entertainment, and a whole lot of appreciation for this wonderful speck of the world.	2003-11-03

Reality, vision, near-death hallucination, it's never clear what she saw, but not long after her death letters from the missing man, written fifty years before just after he abandoned Toronto and headed south to the U.S. in the depths of the Great Depression,  begin to arrive.  Navigating by the trail of postmarks the nephew reaches Ashland where he encounters his again young uncle one midnight outside the hospital where the uncle worked briefly.  Soon he travels back to Great Depression Ashland and is deep into a farfetched miners' plot to rob a bank.  There is plenty of trenchant commentary on the rich, much third person detail of depression suffering (recounting the deaths of children is a favorite theme), a love triangle, a new romance for the jaded but brittle narrator, praise for Fr. Coughlin, the Nazi-sympathizer priest who captivated radio audiences in the Thirties, and some fairly stilted dialogue meant as romantic banter.  None of this engaged me much, however, and I finished the short novel with nothing more than a sense of another book read and not likely to be long-remembered.	2003-09-20

The trip was in 1987 and would be impossible today because some of the route through Colombia is under violent guerrilla control.  I would have liked much more of the trip and much less of the preparations. The logistics of preparing for long-distance race driving are staggering, but -- alas -- they are also not very interesting and well over a third of the less than 300 pages cover the getting ready.  Once on the road some of Cahill's descriptions of the people and terrains through which they drive are terrific, especially the accounts of the Atacama desert in northern Chile and especially scary driving through Central America.  I'd have liked more of that, but too much of the writing is of the &quot;by five o'clock we reached x where we stopped for gas and got directions out of town&quot; variety.  Kind of like reading your MapQuest driving directions; they fill space, (usually) get you there, but are more functional than interesting.  In the end, while I enjoyed Road Fever I thought it would be more fun than it was.  Final note: absence of a map or maps is inexplicable.	2003-07-23

Thus it is hardly surprising that Fatsis' most prominent theme, shared by those involved at all levels -- but particularly ownership/management -- of the Northern League, is that MLB and its minors have become hidebound, soulless businesses.  This is absolutely true naturally, but all that is required to confirm it is a couple of examples to hammer that point home, not the drumbeat reiteration that Fatsis provided throughout the book.  When he concentrates on the personalities, fans, cities, and -- most particularly -- ballpark atmospherics of the Northern League, Wild and Outside gets much more entertaining.  My personal favorite was Ted Cushmore, the put-upon owner of the hapless Duluth franchise.  Fatsis had lots of access to many participants in the league and, not surprisingly, those who talked most freely to him tend to get the most sympathetic treatment, a bias which colors the history to an extent the reader can only guess at.  As baseball reads go, however, this one ranks in the upper middle of the crowded pack.	2003-02-23

The final thread connecting Virginia Woolf, the New York Mrs. Dalloway, and Laura Brown arrives with considerable affection and subtlety.  The writing throughout is spare, precise, sympathetic and true.  The novel, far more than the movie, delivers on the title: every single human battles depression and loss, but there are those Hours, when life is suddenly all that we think it should be always.  They come unexpectedly, often unrecognized but we stay alive for them, alert for them, even when it seems impossible that any one will ever come again. <br />Highly praised novels often disappoint me when I finally get around to reading them.

This is a different twist on that theme; Kisor, a critic for a Chicago newspaper, doesn't take to the open road, he takes to the open sky in a small Cessna.  And not just any open sky; it is the open sky which the nearly forgotten Cal Rodgers followed in the first solo flight across the United States.  Coincidentally, Kisor and Rodgers share the handicap of being deaf.  This all makes for a leisurely and instructive read on flying, on living deaf in a hearing world, and -- gently -- on growing older and finding the new satisfactions rather than the disappointments of that fact.  Kisor's writing is not particularly gripping and his journey is mostly uneventful.  Rodgers' trip was much different, plagued by all manner of equipment and crash problems, some of them triggered by his own aggressive and overconfident actions.  Kisor's episodic retelling of that journey, based on an unpublished work by a woman he meets along his own route, is the best part of Flight.	2003-01-22

Bernard and June are Yin and Yang, material one and spiritual the other, but because they are both so unidimensional, not only can they not live with each other in marriage, they aren't all that interesting either, though if you've got to pick one, take June.  Not much better is son-in-law Jeremy, their memoirist who faithfully transcribes their stories spanning five decades.  And the dogs of the title, and the harrowing incident to which the short book points throughout, do not work except on the most obvious level as a symbol of unspeakable evil always loose somewhere in the world.  Much better than the main story lines and characters are the sidebars, often mere glimpses, of other places and people.  Jeremy's niece is elusive, sad, and always remotely present in his mind.  The command of two girls who come to Bernard's rescue as he is about to be beaten by young thugs in a celebrating is deftly sketched as is the woman who commands Jeremy \\"Ca suffit\\" in the book's closing scenes.  Berlin as the wall comes down is exciting and suffocating at once.  Best of all, however, are McEwan's descriptions of the remote and ancient rural France where he retraces the pivotal day in Bernard and June's marriage.  If you have not read any McEwan, Black Dogs is not the place to start.  Those familiar with his work will also find this less memorable than much else he has written.	2003-01-22

I thought Calia was on to something in the early set up of The Unspeakable, for the first 50 pages or so make very taut reading.  Pretty quickly, however, the two protagonists grow wearisome in their cat and mouse dialogue about their shared histories and the healings taking place in a parish that ministers largely to the deaf.  Also, Calia cheats too often by withholding key bits of information, trying to make them more significant or surprising than they are.  Sub-plots -- both in the present and the past --  abound, way too many for a novel barely 200 pages long, and many of them play out too patly and abruptly.  Not sure I'd want either one of these guys for my priest.  And why, I wondered throughout, is the Church's hierarchy so determined to discredit the faith-based healings that the mute Father Maybury seems to inspire?<br />For a much better rendering of the mysteries of faith and its effect on those who witness its workings, check out Mariette in Ecstasy by Ron Hanson.	2002-09-02

Dawidoff's writing and research are thorough.  Berg left behind a wealth of personal material and many who knew him were still alive and available by phone or personal interview to Dawidoff.  Hundreds of anecdotes and details about Berg's life emerge from these resources, and Dawidoff marches them all past the reader.  The question is &quot;Why?&quot;  Berg never becomes very interesting.  It is well-known that he was a mediocre major league catcher.  He was not much better as a spy, excelling mostly at running up large expense accounts.  His tradecraft was abysmal; making and keeping notes to himself about briefings he received is such a fundamental error as to be ludicrous.  After more than 300 pages it remained hard for me to take Berg seriously in any of his endeavors.  In the end this is the biography of a moderately interesting obsessive dilettante, whose avoidance of normal human contact except on his own often strange terms seems almost pathological.  Dawidoff tries valiantly but a New Yorker profile of about one-tenth this length would have been a sufficient account of Moe Berg's mildly curious life.	2002-07-23

Mallon has done his historical research on the time and the town well, and, among the numerous narrator points of view, has created some memorable characters, most of whom stand slightly off-center from the main love triangle.  A few never take on more than a single dimension, particularly the striver teenager Billy Grimes.  And the deep dark secret that drives much of the novel's action hardly seems momentous after fifty years, let alone shocking if it were to be revealed.  But those are small quibbles for the opportunity to spent novel time with the cantankerous Horace Sinclair, the apparently shallow neophyte politician Peter Cox, the forever grieving mother Jane Herrick, her trapped son Tim, and the high school teacher Frank Sherwood who introduces them through his telescope to Jupiter while carefully keeping his own world hidden from all.  Because Mallon succeeds in making both the characters and the time affecting, the upbeat ending for nearly everyone is a pleasure.  Sure, it's not a happy ever after assurance that Mallon delivers as the country careens toward the second half of the 20th century, but he has skillfully brought each character around to the opportunity to live a chosen, rather than prescribed, life, and therein lies much of the considerable satisfaction this novel gives.	2002-04-01

It is also quite compelling in the scenes with the pedophile kidnapper and the boy.  Beyond that, it feels padded and overlong.  The characters are screen-ready caricatures, maybe because Harmetz used to cover Hollywood for the New York Times.  Most annoying are the numerous moments when the narrative veers, momentarily or for several sentences, into Basic Truth Writing, e.g. \\"On some streets, rush hour in Los Angeles lasts all day\\" or \\"It is odd how quickly the abnormal becomes normal.\\", the standard weapons of a writer not yet skilled enough or confident enough to rely on her writing alone to convey the intended Basic Truth.  While the novel is a quick read -- often because you can skip a lot -- and competently, no more, written, the reasons for the strongly positive reviews of it in the NYT and elsewhere elude me.	2002-02-03

The Porsche Boxster featured in this book is obviously a primo vehicle for the journey.  Alas, James Morgan is not the companion of choice, and this book -- whose premise of a Interstate journey from Miami to Portland atttracted me to it -- lost a star about every fifty pages.  Ruminating on whether Americans as a people (and we are basically talking men here -- women exist mostly as ornaments impressed by cars) long most for the open road or the comforts of home, Morgan tells car stories, but not enough of them or particularly interesting ones. He worries about the designs of people he meets along the way and how much he spends on the motels where he stays.  Earrings, scruffy beards, long straggly hair on those he meets seem to evoke in him images of horrors about to be inflicted on his person, although these folk invariably offer him kindness both small and large.  Frequent flashbacks to his adolescence -- wink, wink -- hint strongly at the seductive qualities of cars he owned in his early driving years.  He quarrels with his wife before embarking from Miami and too many pages are spent alluding to this quarrel (details of which are never shared) and the in-trip visit and numerous telephone calls that only seem to exacerbate it.  On the evidence of this book, Morgan's trip brought more bother than pleasures or answers, and he writes of it with prose that is neither original or engrossing.  My advice:  don't subject yourself to his angst.  Instead, take a fast car out for an open road run.	2002-01-13

This is a quick, very enjoyable read, and I can't imagine that a single person of the Baby Boomer down to the mid-30's age range will fail to recognize him- or herself in at least one of the novel's characters or predicaments.  My personal favorite is a moment within the &quot;wedding on a tight budget&quot; theme when Dave and Julie are arguing over whether to have a band or a deejay at their reception.  Dave, who has made a big part of his life, if not his living, playing with his buddies in The Wishbones at weddings, informs Julie that having a deejay instead of a band is like inviting Hitler to the wedding.  Julie looks at him astonished and says, &quot;Hitler?!  Are you crazy?&quot;  Well, yes, of course he is, who's not as their wedding day approaches, particularly with the complications Dave has mounted for himself in his final single man weeks.  In the end, I think he does the right thing (other reviewers here seem to disagree) and Perrotta smartly ends his book on a note of uncertainty which manages at once to suggest that the right thing is not automatically a sure thing and marriage is never the end of all things single.  Certainly not overly ambitious in its intentions, The Wishbones thoroughly entertains.	2001-12-09

His descriptions and accounts of the bush of Southern Africa are indeed compelling.  Unfortunately, they are far too often buried under considerably less interesting material.  I wanted to see and hear a whole lot more of the Kalahari and the Bushmen and a whole lot less of Van der Post's incessant insistence on his relation to the desert, his relation to the Bushman, his troubles with the cinematographer he hired to photograph his search.  Also, this book was written in 1959, in the United States a time well before the Civil Rights movement and in Southern Africa a time of apartheid and white colonialism.  Van Der Post is very much a man of his era and the book is replete with paternalism and grousings about the black porters in his expedition.  Finally, his leadership is abysmal.  He takes his party to a huge swamp in the Okavango where to any casual observer the elusive Bushman (Bushman, Laurens, not Waterman) would be least likely to be found.  This gross miscalculation takes up well over a third of the book and must have sorely tried the patience of those in his expedition even more than it tried the patience of this reader.  In fairness, for those unfamiliar with the Bushman and the Kalahari and Okavango of Southern Africa, this book does serve, despite Van der Post's flawed, and heavy-handed writing.	2001-11-12

Berton is an easy, if not compelling read. I learned a whole lot more than necessary about the machinations of the power players in the early hydroelectric industry in Niagara. Amidst all that detail, however, Berton properly highlights the importance of the Falls to industrial development in both the United States and Canada, a fact easily overlooked in the popular image of Niagara. My own Falls memories include being thirteen and reading in 1960 the next day's Buffalo newspapers about the boy who accidentally went over the Falls in his bathing suit and survived, the only person ever to do so. The history Berton draws of the man's life after that miracle made interesting reading, as did the reasons the first person to survive going over in a barrel had for doing so. There is a full panoply here of fools, stoic rescuers (and body retrievers), and shysters, but I found Berton's efforts to be exhaustive sometimes obscured the lure and power that makes Niagara the popular fascination it has always been.  That said, I know much more about Niagara than I did before and would recommend this as a quick summer read to anyone with curiosity about this natural, and -- Berton makes clear -- ever-changing wonder.	2001-09-02

His prose is restrained and precise.  He knows the use of silence on the page; his dialogue convinces both in the words and the spaces between the words.  I read in a profile of Maxwell in the New Yorker that he wrote this novel's numerous short chapters by deciding which characters hadn't talked together for a while in the story, and getting them together.  I liked that thought.  Whether true or not, in reading this novel one enters two different times  -- 1948 when Maxwell wrote it and the 1912 Midwest he recreates.  I can't imagine something this quiet and directed being written in these frenetic times.  It is a wander through memory, but -- thanks to Maxwell's careful rendering -- better than memory for it is sharp, accurate and sure. <br />Still, I can't give this novel a five star rating.  As much as I like Maxwell, his writing and the obvious care he took to get the language exactly right, a craftsman at work, the key characters don't really convince me.  Nora is much too shallow to captivate, confuse or immobilize someone like Austin.  Meanwhile, Austin himself is, in some parts of the novel,  too smart, too dogged in the flashback of his pursuit of Martha, to also be as easily duped or unfeeling as he is drawn in others.  <br />Here's a final recommendation, though -- when the final scene arrives for each character, and they pass through the novel for the last time, one cares about each one and what happens in the unknown next that extends beyond the last page.	2001-05-19

Ms. Winn's precise, quick-reading prose will convert any reader to a greater, renewed, or first appreciation for wildlife in Central Park in particular, but, even more, for what nature will have going on anywhere.  There are several stories here, all fascinating:  the cycle of bird life in and migration through the Park; Pale Male and his families; and those humans, so normal in their individual quirkiness, who take up his cause through the years.  Ms. Winn's particular and not easy skill is to let all these stories move themselves, and therefore sweep the reader along with all the quiet excitements, joy, and sadnesses they convey.  A book to buy and keep always.	2001-04-13

There are some very funny moments -- for example, a devastating take on tap dancing and the poor starving children of -- in this case -- Latin America.  The memories of the Canadiens and the other original NHL teams  before expansion, and the frigid days and nights of street hockey are exactly right.  Plus, Uncle Reginald and Draper Doyle are consistently engaging and give the book most of its considerable energy, although it stretches credulity that a nine year old boy should so completely recall over several detailed pages a dream absolutely crucial to the novel's climatic moments.  Bigger problems:  Draper's mother is too peripheral, as ethereal as the ghost father, and Aunt Phil and Uncle Seymour are so unremittingly mean-spirited that they become more parody than human.  Finally, the twist as Draper Doyle begins to recall the lost week of his father's death is unexpectedly nasty, and leaves this novel uneasily perched between the comic and terrible personal discovery.  Still, while The Divine Ryans is not a must read, it is the work of an author with talent clearly under development.	2001-02-19

Just when I would settle into one book, swallowing Blew's often self-pitying tone, wham, off we would go into another book.  She is trying for a quilt of a book and leaves us with pieces.  But these pieces are often of very good writing indeed, especially the fond anecdotes of the generations of horses which worked the family property.  As you read, remember the family motto  --&quot;Never speak aloud of what you feel deeply.&quot;  As often as I was engrossed in what is in this book, I wondered what deliberately is kept out and how other voices -- the daughter and the aunt -- might tell this story.	2001-02-10

The plot here -- IRA fugitive, McGreevy, hides out in the crumbling home of an aged widow, Josie -- is the simple premise on which O'Brien builds a vertiginous, multi-layered tale of fatefully intersecting interpersonal and national histories.  The third person narrative points of view are multiple and, especially in the quick cuts to those on the fugitive's trail, occasionally confusing.  McGreevy and Josie are both superbly drawn and utterly convincing, although their emotional linkage is achieved too quickly, just as the flashbacks to Josie's horrid marriage make her reveries of quiet good times with her husband scarcely credible.  The prose is spare, with no wasted words, and one of the wonders of this novel is that O'Brien nonetheless thoroughly conveys the lushness of the drizzly Irish countryside, the complexity of the struggle and the underlying sense of national unity that all the characters -- no matter how harshly at war with one another -- feel.  And she has packaged all that in what is also from start to finish a superbly suspenseful tale.  The 230 or so pages flash by, making The House of Splendid Isolation an exciting and rewarding one-sitting read.	2001-02-03

Why did it kill those in the prime of life more efficiently than the usual flu victims, the very young or the very old?  Where did it go after its nine month run through the world in 1918-1919?  Can it strike again?  Why has it been largely forgotten by historians?  Engaging questions all, and Alfred Crosby asks them and to a greater or lesser extent seeks to answer them.  Still, this book is less than it could be, written for too much of its length as if he were keeping his narrative powers deliberately in check.  For those that doubt he is capable of powerful writing, the last chapter stands as rebuttal, with its tribute to Katherine Anne Porter -- to whom the book is dedicated -- and an adult's recollection of how the flu brought home at age seven the early realization that &quot;life was not a perpetual present, and that even tomorrow would be part of the past, and that for all my days and years to come I too must one day die.&quot;  I'd like to have seen more of those personal close-ups of the impact of the flu instead of the grim numbers in Philadelphia, then the grim numbers in San Francisco, then the grim numbers in Alaska.  It is as if Crosby wanted to write a history of the era as it was lived with the flu and wound up writing a journal of morbidity and mortality, and the virus sleuthing that followed.  He aimed for a vision and achieved a laboratory slide  -- no mean accomplishment, but not, I think, what we or he were finally after.	2001-01-25

However, if you want a cheering section for your favorite artist/group (as a number of the folks who have reviewed this book seem to think C. should be about), then this may not be your best way to spend twenty bucks or so.  He'll like some of them, sure, and it's a little high I suppose to have your own faves blessed by Bellwether Bob.  Personally, I think he's dead wrong in many cases (Syd Straw and Nick Cave for two), but reading Christgau take a figurative meat cleaver to overrated critic faves is always a pleasure -- even if you disagree with his views.  Also, I like the way -- unlike the standard Rolling Stone or Spin critic  -- Christgau doesn't write in hushed awe at the Temple of Rock and Rap.  Music around the world (and Christgau is VERY around the world here, lots of groups/singers you've never heard of) is supposed to be entertainment, after all, not a monument for the ages, and Christgau approaches his work as a avid listener.  That, combined with the man's way with words makes him your best guide available if you are looking to move your musical tastes in some directions you haven't tried before.	2001-01-02

Al Gore's word &quot;snippy&quot; was invented for this guy.  The characters he shadows in the 14th century are equally dullish and two dimensional, plus who's betraying whom -- politically and maritally -- pales quickly.  I read waiting for the twist (it is a nice ending!) and for the very thoroughly researched details of Cornwall now and six centuries ago.  Unfortunately, one feels considerably more interest in the drug, that transporting liquid, than in anything else, not a good sign for a novel of really unrequited love.  The final fifty pages fly past but getting to that point is as much of a slog as the time travelers moving through the cold marshes and estuaries of the past.	2000-12-20

I suppose that's why it took me so long to finish it.  It's no page-turner.  Miller drives and busses around Cuba, asks himself the same questions again and again in the different regions, dips superficially into recent and distant history, stands in innumerable lines at the Socialism and Death bakery, follows a lousy baseball team for a week on the road, comes close to sexism in a detailed description of the Cuban man's love for the Cuban woman's buttocks, and makes the obligatory visit to Hemingway's years-untouched home.  All of it is interesting enough and none of it is captivating.  In the end, Miller's snapshot approach winds up making Cuba sound like not much more than one in a number of Caribbean islands.  That of course is part of his point, but the more than that of Cuba -- both good and bad -- is what Miller misses.  Two hours spent with Buena Vista Social Club is a considerably better investment of time.	2000-11-26

It's an apt choice, for much of this book recalls Borges and his labyrinths.  The erudite and obscure histories Sebald writes could just as well be fictions, so remote and dazzling strange are they, qualities especially evident as he recounts the destruction of the garden of Yuan Ming Yuan.  Reading the pleasantly convoluted sentences often felt like the last scattered vision before sleep or, at the end of the night, before waking.  Sadness, loss, decline and decay are constant companions here to both the hiker and the reader.  The narrator winds up in a mental hospital a year after the walk and various friends unexpectedly die.  Hotels in beach towns that once welcomed European royalty go weeks without guests.  And lest we lose perspective on the place of man and mankind in all this, Sebald reminds that &quot;...the history of every individual, of every social order, indeed of the whole world, does not describe an ever-widening, more and more wonderful arc, but rather follows a course which, once the meridian is reached, leads without fail down into the dark.&quot;  Or, &quot;...whenever one is imagining a bright future, the next disaster is just around the corner.&quot;  This should all be quite gloomy, as should Borges, but somehow it is not.  Rather, it reminds us of what an ongoing pageant we have all entered for a small role in a brief moment of the planet.  So why not five stars?  Because Borges got there first and finest to these truths.	2000-10-09

For nearly two years, in  conditions of constant zero and below cold, freezing wet, and often hunger,  Ernest Shackleton kept all 27 men who sailed with him on the Endurance  alive to eventually return to the England they left on the verge of World  War I.  That single-minded devotion to his men should make this book  required reading for every would-be politician and corporate executive  before he dares ask for the faith, trust and respect of those he would  lead.   <br />Lansing dedicated the book &quot;In appreciation for whatever it  is that makes men accomplish the impossible.&quot;  He wisely and without  flourish often lets the men's own words -- through the journals that many  of them kept at the time and in interviews forty years later -- tell their  extraordinary story, each stage of which reads more harrowing than the  last.  On an expedition that would have attempted to cross the Antarctic on  foot (a feat not accomplished until four decades later), the Endurance is  trapped in pack ice before it can reach shore.  Shackleton's perhaps  foolhardy original goal thus turns to keeping his men alive until they can  be rescued.  After ten months locked in the drifting pack, the Endurance is  crushed and the men forced to abandon her for an ice floe, then several  weeks later a smaller floe still.  Eventually they take to three boats to  reach forlorn Elephant Island from which Shackleton takes a skeleton crew  of five and in a 22 foot open boat navigates the enormous seas of Drake's  Passage to South Ascension Island.  Once there he only (only!) has  uncharted glaciers to cross to reach the whaling station on the other side  of the island from which rescue of the Elephant Island castaways is  eventually launched.  The only other crossing of South Georgian Island by  foot at the time Lansing wrote in 1959 occurred on a &quot;easier&quot;  route with equipment and time.  Shackleton had neither, only a fifty foot  piece of rope, a carpenter's adze, and the knowledge that to stop moving  was to invite death by freezing.  At journey's end, to the astonished  manager of the whaling factory, he says simply, &quot;My name is  Shackleton.&quot;  I would have liked to have known him and all his men.	2000-08-14

He's as talented as they come.  That's clear in every well-crafted line he puts on  paper here.  Great parts of this short novel are intensely moving and wise,  e.g. &quot;it's one of the first great adult sadnesses, coming to see what  you've chosen to waste, an hour too late.&quot;  Just as gripping is young  Rafe Noren's sudden quoting of the St. Paul verse which gives the book its  title and is spoken again in the climatic scene with Bridge Boatner and  Chief, the summer camp director, as they together realize that Rafe was an  old soul in a young body. <br />But this book annoyed me as much as it  impressed me.  Narrator Boatner is the reason.  He's by turns smug, whiney,  and smitten.  Smug in his reiterated insistence on his own talent as a  painter, whiney in his incessant explication of how hard his father's death  was on him (you're not the only person who lost a beloved father at 21,  Boat), and smitten with 14 year old Rafe who is seldom permitted to be seen  off his pedestal of perfect boy and thus never fully realized as a  character.   For example, Rafe can't be simply a splendidly talented  interpreter of Indian dances; he's instead described thirty years later  (this is a novel of remembrance) by Bridge as the finest male dancer he's  ever seen including all the Russian ballet greats.  I'm sorry, that's  hyperbole and it undercuts the narrator's credibility.  Or, on one hand,  Bridge is insisting that he really hasn't thought all that much about Rafe  in 30 years, or that he probably didn't spend more than an hour alone with  him in the entire summer, and yet he meticulously recreates long dialogues  with Rafe and recalls every detail of their contact.  In the final pages he  infuriated me by declining to own up to his crucial, though not directly  causatory, role in what happens to Rafe.<br />Love the message, can't stand  the messenger.  It translates to three stars out of five in my book.	2000-08-03

Her problem, I think, is that she is so captivated by her own abilities that she scarecely lets the reader appreciate them for himself.  I, for one, found the  constant interventions of the narrator and her leaning on the reader to be  both repetitive and annoying.  The story itself is told in about twice the  time it should take and with the exception of Irini, her father, and Ruby  Redd, none of the characters are fully realized for me.  This is  particularly and sadly true of Ada who is mostly caricature, but meant -- I  think -- to be sympathetic.  Keeping the members of the Sweethearts  straight was a major task.  On the plus side, this is a fine rendering of  America just after WWII and is pretty funny in many parts; the humor of the  letters and the recipes tucked in between the story is especially fun.  A  talent at work surely, but too much intent on displaying itself to make the  world of the fiction fully realized.  One time to pay attention to the  narrator:  when she tells you to skip the last four pages, do so.	2000-07-16

As a white age contemporary of Gates, I was impressed  by the  evenhandedness with which he tells the story of the often grudging  desegregation of the late 50s and 60s in West Virginia, and surprised by  the extent of black/white interaction -- sometimes positive for Gates -- in  this small town, even in the days of segregation.  That is obviously a  function of small town life, but it struck me as more than in many parts of  US life today, leading to the question I wondered about throughout this  book -- whether 46 years after Brown vs. Board of Education we are more,  not less, isolated by color in our social interactions in the United  States.  If so, that's a tragedy for all of us.	2000-07-09

Throughout, he achieves a sense of time, place and self which crosses  generations.  He charts both the constants and the increasing changes of  the farm which has been in his family for more than a hundred years and the  country around it.

Miguel Tejada was one of those who, it turned out, wasn't just  cheap filler for an organization's minor league chain, but instead broke  through to the majors.  This surprised the A's organization which  originally ranked him below other Dominicans who have since faded and  returned to island obscurity or the life of an undocumented alien in New  York City.  Unfortunately, the author's case is buried by some truly  stilted prose in a narrative that wanders all over the map without giving  Tejada himself much more life in the book than as a paradigm for the  author's argument.  I happen to know already a fair amount about Latin  ballplayers so this book brought me neither increased insight into them as  a group or to Tejada as an individual.	2000-06-09

It is well-written, often moving, and fascinating as it veers into Krakauer's own solo climbing in Alaska.   For all Krakauer's efforts, however, Chris McCandless remains just as  elusive in death as he was in life.  Simply put, maybe he just didn't leave  enough clues or enough witnesses in his two year hegira which ended in the  abandoned bus in Alaska.  Krakauer's done his research, the tales of others  similar to McCandless are fascinating, and as a parent of similar aged kids  this is a painful read for their loss.  Still, I finally conclude that the  book does not add a great deal to the barren eloquence of the Outdoor  article based on McCandless' own small diary kept as his fate closed in on  him.	2000-06-01

A book by and for north people, who grew up in cold winters, whose toes froze on the walk back from pond to home, and who built the small fires of kindling and scrap wood to stay warm as afternoon faded and the hockey game  went on.  I hadn't thought for years about the way we carried skates, even  those of us who didn't play much, by their laces slung over the blade of  the hockey stick, but Peter LaSalle gets that detail and so much else about  the game and the era, late fifties to early seventies mostly, exactly  right.  The problem is the stories themselves are lightweight and entirely  too similar in tone and substance.  The first two -- Hockey Angels and Le  Rocket Negre -- are the best of the book, closely followed by three poems,  particularly A Pond-Hockey Pledge.  So, overall, a slight read, but still,  for those of us who come from this place and this era, there's a sweet feel  of things gone by here, and it's nice to see hockey written about, and this  book can be good consolation in late spring when your team has been  unceremoniously booted from the Stanley Cup playoffs.	2000-05-16

Mariette will be with us, as she was with  all who know her, even scorn her, in the novel, for a long,long time.	1999-02-20

Let me get this straight -- Hornby takes us through some two decades of his fanatic devotion to Arsenal and in the course of that time they win -- by my count -- at least four major championships of the endless variety  that European football seems to offer.  This is suffering????  Gees, he  should be a San Francisco Giants fan like me and you folks in Chicago would  find him even more of a whiner.  Still, he's a lot of fun in his whiny  fandom, and more than once you'll feel this book is a mirror of your own  disproportionate affection for a sports team that has broken your heart too  many times to count.  Give this book to your wife, girlfriend (or for that  matter, husband or boyfriend) who just doesn't understand why you have to  slip away from the party, the restaurant, to seek out a TV, or call a  scoreline and check how the lads are doing (although you know, of course,  that they are losing).  It's also worth noting that Fever Pitch was made  into a pretty good movie which, to my knowledge, hasn't been released in  the US.  I saw it a couple years ago on an airplane across the Atlantic  before I'd read the book or heard of Hornby's novels.  Last thought:  the  best book ever of this biography/sports fan genre is Frederick's Exley's A  Fan's Notes.	1999-02-20

We are back in rural Mexico, its people bemused and amused by the strangers among them, its roads of detours and dead ends, its  dust, its sudden beauty.  Five expatriates come to Amapolas, their lives  interwoven over five or six years, loosely connected like the chapters of  the novel, each of which could stand -- and some of which were published as  -- a short story.  Bud Loomis is the most surprising, Ursula Bowles, the  widow who has come back to Mexico more than sixty years after her  childhood, is the most perceptive.  Then, one by one, changed, renewed or  returned by these years, the foreigners leave Amapolas and their homes on  the plain.  They thought they would stay forever, instead they forever take  Amapolas with them.  I only wish Harriet Doerr had begun publishing long  before her seventies, for these two novels are gems worth discovering.	1999-02-09
US	52331096	REWEKL1TCWHDS	0060974877	337617165	The Voice of America: Stories	Books	4	1	1	N	N	An unexpected pleasure, well-written and sharply observed	About a third of the these stories are set in the late forties (the first begins on VJ Day 1945) and fifties, while the rest are contemporary.  Each Voice of America is male, often middle-aged, often eccentric,  dystfunctional or, in a couple of cases, downright creepy.  They generally  exist at the margins of what passes for the American dream, a world of  trailer parks, door to door salespeople, and road wanderers.  DeMarinis is  certainly not in the business of either transformation or redemption for  these people and places.  Still, through his eye for telling detail -- one  character dreams of &quot;places so familiar and yet so utterly lost that  he would wake up with tears on his face, even though the places he dreamed  about were nowhere he'd ever been&quot; -- and true talk dialogue, more  often than not these stories break through irony and malaise to hope.   Among the best:  &quot;Paraiso: An Elegy,&quot; &quot;Wilderness,&quot; the  strange encounter of &quot;Infidelity,&quot; and &quot;The Voice of  America.&quot;  But my personal favorite is &quot;Her Alabaster Skin,&quot;  in which a romance novelist writing under the pseudonym Veronica Lamonica  meets the woman hired to be Veronica at book store signings.  All in all,  an excellent read.	1998-12-06

Keep turning the pages, you think, it might get better, there might somewhere be one original scene, thought or character, some insight about that big number that eventually looms up for all of us who live long  enough.  But forget it, not this time, not here, as divorced Doug frets  endlessly -- about his ex-wife remarrying, about his children, about his  sports writing job under the new management of the sports daily where he  works, about his sex life, about his incompatibility with anyone else's  musical tastes, about his aging parents.   Ho hum, I'm 50 and I need my  sleep.  This one won't keep me from it.	1998-11-06

Fuentes is on auto pilot, reprising all the tricks that have worked for years and meanwhile the three main characters never move past being two dimensional cliches.  One bonus, however:   a scene that is a sure nominee for the annual Bad Sex Writing awards.	1998-03-01
