The contributors to the volume provide critiques of the neo-Darwinian synthesis from a variety of angles.  Accordingly, the best way to read the book is to look at the table of contents, flip to the back to read about the contributors, and then choose the chapter that seems the most compelling.  This is the way I've read it and have found it entertaining and rewarding.<br />Besides the great look, feel, and organization of this volume from ISI, readers will get a bracing charge from the sheer controversy inside.  Challenges to Darwin have long been stock material in religious bookstores, but since the publication of \\"Darwin on Trial\\" well over a decade ago, the critiques have become increasingly sophisticated.  \\"Uncommon Dissent\\" captures much of the best critical material.<br />Although many of the chapters are worth special mention, the best is the last, which is a reprint of a famous Commentary essay by David Berlinski.  His arguments are rhetorically devasting and come from a non-religious point of view.  As much fun as his piece is to read, the letters written in response to it and his responses to them constitute a spectacular battle of the brainiacs with Berlinski returning fire magnificently.<br />If you are interested in the \\"evolving\\" controversy over biological origins, \\"Uncommon Dissent\\" is an indispensable addition to your collection.	2004-06-12

Francis Beckwith's modest conclusion falls just slightly to the right of assessments made by other respected legal scholars like Kent Greenawalt and Jay Wexler.  It is his contention that an alternative theory like Intelligent Design could probably survive an Establishment Clause challenge whereas the Genesis-based creation science presentation has not.  Greenawalt and Wexler aren't sure and tend to think ID might not survive an Establishment Challenge.<br />As far as quality goes, the book is well-written and researched.  It also display's Beckwith's strength as a philosopher as he parses arguments.  The bottom line is that Beckwith offers a very modest conclusion.  Intelligent Design may someday be offered as an alternative theory of origins in public school and may survive an Establishment Clause challenge largely due to its lack of allegiance to any theological tradition.  The theory makes no attempt to offer an explanation of who or what provides the agency of design<br />Beckwith's book is a valuable contribution to the literature estimating the constitutional status of intelligent design.  If a court case does arise, his book will certainly be part of the material considered.	2004-05-10

Ann Coulter brings a ferocity to her attacks that simply can't be matched by any other author. If you are angry about the manifestations of the liberal project on American life, no one can take you through primal scream therapy as effectively as Queen Ann.<br />Ann Coulter's last two books, Slander and Treason aren't original in concept. Others have pointed out the liberal bias in the media (see Bias by Bernard Goldberg for example). Many have tried to make sure the American liberal elite are held to account for regularly supporting America's enemies (see Twilight of the Intellectuals by Hilton Kramer or Useful Idiots by Mona Charen). But while she's doesn't pioneer the theory, she always brings big, nasty weapons to the fight. The result is endlessly entertaining to a certain type of reader.<br />Many high brow conservatives worry in public over the stridency of her attacks, but to do so is to miscomprehend Ann's work. She's not out to be the quiet, respectable voice of a David Broder or a George Will. She's like William Wallace whipping up the fury of an army at the front lines. Her books reach out to the frustrated, \\"rank and file\\" conservative by entertaining with powerful rhetoric while arming with endless notes, quotes, and forgotten facts.	2003-07-20

He tells them how to choose their programs of study, where to live, how to conduct themselves at work, how to hold up their end of a conversation, and even suggests how they might build their influence through maintaining a weblog.<br />The book contains a large number of short chapters that each convey a worthwhile lesson about the business of living an infectious and successful life geared toward building God's kingdom. Considering that the man who wrote it has worked for former Presidents, continues a distinguished career in the law, and has achieved a measure of fame as a nationally syndicated talk show host, Hewitt seems to know what he's talking about.<br />Like others who reviewed this book, I would have loved to have read it ten or fifteen years ago since it would have helped me avoid some of the trial and error I've had to endure on the way to my own career in public policy.  With his advice, I might have reached some of my major goals 8-10 years before I did. If you know an ambitious young person, get this book into his or her hands.	2003-04-28

The story really centers on a man who knows what he wants to do and intends to work only on his own terms.<br />Howard Roark bucks architectural norms to create his own designs where form follows function.  While it sounds like an auto commercial today, the notion was more revolutionary when the story was written in the forties.<br />True to Randian form, the pack instincts of Roark's peers take over as they vow to take him down.  His originality and, more importantly, his refusal to act on any terms other than his own infuriate those around him.  Also true to form, our superhuman protagonist has a superhuman mate equally dedicated to pure excellence and pure ego.<br />Both &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; and &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; make for great reading aside from Rand's tendency to engage in speechmaking.  She never trusts the reader to draw the appropriate lessons from the story and therefore sets up melodramatic, scripted speeches of heroic length to drive her points home.  Nevertheless, the books are interesting, with powerful plots, and mark a potent answer to the drive toward collectivization of the twentieth century.	2003-04-16

David Frum is a conservative not afraid to give blunt, constructive criticism to his fellows.  In \\"Dead Right\\", he questions whether the Republican coalition has actually made any progress toward reducing the size and scope of the federal government.  In spite of good intentions, he determines very little progress has been made because the GOP is unwilling to incur the pain of telling people what they don't want to hear, which is that moving from a self-reliant nation to a welfare state has damaged our national character.<br />The contrast between self-reliance and welfarism is the key insight of the book.  Frum points out that negative behaviors like divorce, single parenthood, promiscuity, drug abuse, and chronic unemployment are now subsidized by the state and therefore have ballooned to nearly unmanageable proportions.<br />He realizes that actual budget and program cuts carry a heavy political price.  Regardless, he believes conservatives should pay the price of unpopularity and speak the truth in hopes of someday winning a real victory, rather than a pyrrhic one where office is held, but nothing can be done.<br />In an interesting sideline, Frum takes time to survey the thinking of isolationist \\"paleoconservatives\\" who resent the current influence of the liberal-turned-conservative internationist \\"neo-cons\\" who changed allegiance during the Cold War.  The intramural dispute is very interesting and extremely current with today's events.<br />Frum is one of the few writers who combines statistical analysis with insider history of the movement to create a dazzling policy book.  This is one analysis that doesn't read like a stale pamphlet full of bullet points you've heard a million times.  Besides that, Frum is probably the most talented conservative writing today.  Pick up \\"Dead Right\\" and \\"How We Got Here: The Seventies\\" to see for yourself.	2003-04-13

By opening a window into the lives of different Washington players like Newt Gingrich (the speaker), Daniel Patrick Moynihan (the committee chairman), Sheila Burke (the staffer), Frank Luntz (the pollster), and others, the authors give us a sense of the daily goings-on inside the Beltway.<br />Although Eleanor Clift and her husband are coming from a left of center viewpoint, the information they pass on to the reader is not overly shaded by their biases.  Having watched Ms. Clift on television's &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot;, I would never have imagined she was capable of producing such a well-balanced and insightful account.

In this afterlife dialogue between C.S. Lewis, Aldous Huxley, and John F. Kennedy we see how a Christian answers different worldviews.  C.S. Lewis represents Christianity.  Kennedy represents the common American view that Heaven (if it exists) is about one's personal good outweighing his bad.  Huxley represents eastern religions and pantheism.<br />I've bought this book several times and given it to co-workers and friends.  You won't care if you get it back, because you know you've put a good book in someone's hands who may need it.<br />The book is brief, packed with great arguments, and a very accessible read.

The beginning premise is simple. What would happen if the great economic drivers of society simply dropped out from frustration with those who continually seek to handicap them and help themselves to their wealth through redistribution and regulation?<br />The great industrialists of America begin vanishing without a trace. All have been visited by a shadowy figure prior to their disappearance. Meanwhile, the female railroad tycoon Dagny Taggert is battling to save her own company and keep as many of her high-achieving peers in the game as she can. The plot is fascinating. The characters gain your interest.<br />There is only reason why I give this book four stars rather than five. After clipping along for 900 pages, a major climax of the story is reached as a key character reaches for a microphone to broadcast to the nation. Exciting, yes? It is, at least until you realize the same character is going to give a speech that goes on for about 100 pages and delivers Rand's philosophy in excruciating detail. There's no need. She has made these same points very well through the story.<br />Regardless of Rand's occasional heavy-handedness and failure to trust the reader to learn the lessons she is trying to teach, \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is a major book and should be read.	2003-02-08

The young heroine has just completed a course of electroshock therapy.  Although the procedure leaves her amnesic, she is able to learn what she needs to know by consulting a letter she wrote to herself prior to the last session.<br />Based on that tantalizing start, you might expect a quick moving plot and a tale of conspiracy.  No dice.  This is Walker Percy.  What you're going to get is an exploration of the human psyche and how we manage to get lost from ourselves.  It's not a roller coaster ride, but that's not why we read Walker Percy.  His readers sail into uncharted oceans.	2003-02-07

Evelyn Waugh, G.K. Chesterton, Robert Hugh Benson, T.S. Eliot, Hillaire Belloc and many other colorful characters appear throughout the book.<br />Perhaps the best way to read Pearce is to begin with Literary Converts and then read his biographies on single subjects like Belloc, Chesterton, and Tolkien for more detail.

Building on the work of &quot;Reinventing Government&quot; by Osborne and Gaebler, former Gore speechwriter Andrei Cherny makes the case for a federal government that drops the old &quot;New Deal&quot; bureaucracy in favor of a new guiding and enabling role.  In the course of doing so, Cherny presents American history through the lens of Jeffersonian and Hamiltonian philosophies of government and weaves it together with a demographic portrayal of what he calls &quot;The Choice Generation&quot;.<br />The result is readable and interesting, but left me (admittedly, a Republican) with the feeling that Cherny is in the wrong party.  He believes Americans want the ability to control their lives more than anything else, but doesn't grapple with the notion that lower taxes and control over one's financial resources are probably the single greatest enablers of personal choice.  I'd like to see him deal with the question of financial freedom instead of just blowing past it.<br />Cherny's prose style has speechwriter written all over it.  He clearly enjoys putting together words and phrases that would snap when spoken to an audience.<br />If you're interested in what the future of public policy looks like to a well-informed young writer of the center-left, give The Next Deal a try.	2003-01-25

In essence, they figure out how to state their message in a short, easily understood phrase, then they all line up to repeat it.  Example:  Tax cuts for the rich.  Horowitz uses the main essay to show the GOP how to play the same game and win.  My only complaint is that he doesn't spend more time on that topic.  He could have devoted an entire book to &quot;The Art of Political War&quot; rather than filling it out with assorted essays.  Nevertheless, the essays are of high quality and worth reading in their own right.	2002-12-05

David Horowitz has written a book that will be cited and remembered for many years to come.  His journey from Communist Children's Camp to a successful career in new left journalism to a prominent role as a conservative strategist is fascinating.  More importantly, he puts the entire radical movement of the sixties into perspective by pointing out that ending the draft sucked the life out of the revolution.  What appeared to be high-minded idealism turned out to be mainly fear of getting shot in a jungle war.<br />\\"Radical Son\\" isn't in a league with \\"Witness\\" by Whittaker Chambers as a great political life story, but it approaches it.  Not only do we get the benefit of Horowitz's unique experience as a top player on both sides of the political fence, we also get to learn from his family life, which is instructive.  Pick it up and trade the illusions for the reality.	2002-12-03

His prodigious output and outlandish appearance have made him an unforgettable part of Western culture.  But in this book, we have the eccentric Chesterton writing about the even more astounding character of St. Francis of Assisi.  Chesterton goes through several interesting sketches of St. Francis' life (which are interesting by themselves) and then draws all sorts of fantastic conclusions from the episodes.  I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is curious about Chesterton's writing and Francis' life.	2002-11-27

By pulling together the thought of great conservative thinkers from across the ages, Kirk conclusively proved that a philosophy of conservativism did exist and that it was a worthy alternative to the once-dominant liberal line of mid-twentieth century America.  That may not sound like a spectacular feat, but at the time many wondered whether there was any such thing as a conservative mind, much as many now wonder whether an evangelical mind exists.  Because Kirk mines centuries rather than decades, this is a book that doesn't go out of style.	2002-10-24

While the biographies of Percy are helpful, there's nothing quite like hearing it straight from the author in this series of interviews.

Every Person's Guide to Topsy-Turvy Times	Books	3	13	15	N	N	Creative and Chaotic, But Possibly Disastrous	Tom Peters is a management prophet with a lot of fascinating ideas.  This book is a collection of his thoughts where you'll see a strong emphasis on destroying superfluous hierarchies and worn-out practices.  That's the Peters message and it's worthwhile.  However, he has an annoying tendency to insist on his own authority that businesses make radical changes lest they perish.  In many cases, I wonder why.  Peters has no apparent respect for the point of view that tradition represents collected wisdom about things that have worked and may well keep working.<br />What really ruined the book for me, though, was a panel discussion on diversity in which Peters attributes his own success to being a white male Protestant born in 1942.  That kind of racial reductionism is horse-puckey and contradicts his emphasis on self-determination and constant renewal.<br />I still give the book three stars for entertainment value, a smart format, and general provocation.	2002-09-05

During the impeachment, Bennett quickly produced The Death of Outrage\\".  After the invasion of Afghanistan, Bennett published Why We Fight to make the moral case for the war against terrorism.  The Broken Hearth was the exception that proves the rule.  Hearth was poised to serve as a forceful summation for the marriage movement which would bring the message to the large audience his books typically reach.  Like so many other good things, however, Hearth was somewhat lost in the wake of September 11.  Now that Congress is considering the re-authorization of welfare reform that emphasizes the importance of marriage lifestyles over serial cohabitation, it's a good time to revisit Bennett's superb work.<br />In six quick chapters, Bennett brings the reader up to date on the need for marriage-based families better than virtually any who have tried.  He surveys the current situation, the meaning of family in history, and suggests productive ways to repair a culture that does too little to keep families together.  Perhaps more importantly, Bennett analyzes homosexual unions with the sensitivity and erudition the topic deserves.  He makes his points firmly, but without rancor.  Get the book and read it with pencil or highlighter.  It's the kind of volume that rewards careful reading.	2002-08-29

According to them, Christianity is anti-science, pro-slavery, anti-progress, and anti-intellectual.  It was this stereotypical view the Washington Post repeated when it asserted Christian conservatives were \\"poor, uneducated, and easily led.\\"  To these people, Christians are backwards individuals relying on a psychological crutch to see them through the storms of Darwinistic evolution and Jeffersonian separation of church and state.  In other words, Christians are trapped in the permanent caricature of believer William Jennings Bryan being cut to pieces by atheist Clarence Darrow on the witness stand during the Scopes Trial.<br />If you're looking for an easy to read volume that brings together the best answers to the standard objections to the faith, then \\"Christianity on Trial\\" fits the bill exactly.  The authors strike the perfect balance between writing for a popular audience and documenting assertions with footnotes so more ambitious readers will be able to dig more deeply if they wish.  In this book, you'll find more than enough ammunition for your armchair and watercooler debates about Christianity, history, philosophy, and science.<br />In essence, the authors are calling for a contemporary reevaluation of the contributions of the Christian faith.  Their narrative paints a picture of a church that ended slavery, created hospitals for the poor, and brought about the modern conception of the individual as a creation of God worthy of dignity and equality.  Hopefully, Carroll and Shiflett's work will remove the veil of ignorance both mass media and its consumers still wear.	2002-08-29

Coulter makes a strong case that liberals have long given up legitimate debate in favor of name-calling and demonization.  At the same time, her return fire is so hot she makes a case for herself as the most gifted polemicist of the last decade.  Not even William F. Buckley at his most withering generated the kind of heat Coulter does.  It's clear that this book is the glove that slaps a face with every intention of starting a fight.  As a conservative frustrated by being constantly compared to Nazi's and racists for opposing things like high taxes, I found myself hoping someone would accept her challenge.<br />The only possible criticism of the book is that Ann stoops the level of her opponents on several occasions by calling them dumb.  In fairness to her, she provides the evidence for her charge more often than not!	2002-07-07

Conservatives have been complaining for years about liberal media bias only to be ignored or told they're paranoid.  Through the decades, the allegation remained the stuff of conservative mythology.  But with the publication of \\"Bias\\" Bernard Goldberg became the first member of Big Media to step outside the fortress and admit the truth.  He paid a price by being blacklisted at CBS.<br />The book gained a great deal of attention not only because it was the first crack in the fictitious edifice of \\"objective reporting\\", but also because it was published during the time of Fox News' ascension to the number one spot in cable news.  If there were no media bias, then why were people flocking to the new option and it's center-right orientation in contrast to everything that existed before it?<br />Goldberg is at his best when he tells his own story of what happened when he published a Wall Street Journal column about media bias.  We get insight into the inner workings of CBS news and how lonely Goldberg became when he ran afoul of \\"The Dan\\" aka Dan Rather.  The second half of the book is more analytical with regard to the problem of media bias.  The best part of the second half is Goldberg's chapter on the lack of reportage on family breakdown and its effects.	2002-06-30

He's hard-working, brilliant, and writes like a man playing a burning piano.<br />Although many know him best for his novels like &quot;Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; and &quot;A Man in Full&quot;, you're missing his best work if you don't read the essay collections like &quot;Hooking Up&quot;.  In this volume, we get the true story behind the birth of Silicon Valley, a tale of a great artist no one knows because he possesses actual skill, a novella skewering the television news magazines, and several other gems.<br />If you have a Wolfe collection, add this book to it.

Wolfe takes on 20th century architecture in a way that is entertaining even to the layperson who knows nothing about the subject.  He gets way inside any subject he writes about and examines it like a turbo-charged, pro-middle class, high IQ, red, white, and blue machine.  The results are always entertaining.	2002-06-30

It sat provocatively upon the shelf as a slim volume shrink-wrapped on the shelf.  When I took the dive and purchased it, I realized many of the pages were only a quarter or half filled with text.  Had I been cheated?  Absolutely not.  You don't get a lot of words for your money, but you do get wisdom.  Pressfield puts forth the highly believable theory that many of our problems in life come from not fulfilling our calling and from an almost pathological need to take the path of least resistance instead of the path of greatest fulfillment.  He repeats the old advice about writers being committed to write everyday, but there is much more about the nature of inspiration and how to focus on the work itself, rather than obsessing about the fruits you hope to obtain.  The icing on the cake is that Pressfield takes you through his own history and shows how he finally triumphed over his own self-defeating behavior.  This is one self-help book worth the price of admission!	2002-06-02

After I read this book I had no choice but to immediately consume Walker Percy's novels.  Reading Lancelot was like having the top of my head blown off and surviving the experience more awake and alive than ever.  In an era where no one is really sure what they believe anymore, Percy sets out an interesting test.  If you discovered clear evidence of evil, what would that tell you about the existence of good and maybe even God?  I strongly suggest you take this journey and pay very close attention to the parallel travels of the main character's confidant, a priest-psychologist who is himself in crisis.  If you do so, the ending will make the hairs stand up on the back on your neck.	2002-05-29

I'd heard Nash's book referred to many times but avoided reading it because I thought I knew the modern history of conservative thought fairly well.  I was wrong.  Just as attending law school taught me I didn't know nearly as much about the Constitution as I thought I did, reading Nash taught me I didn't know nearly as much about 20th century conservatism as I'd believed.  If you're a conservative, it's thrilling to watch the movement grow from a tiny group with little status into a powerful force capable of electing a president.  It's also very practical because you can see the supporting structures of a movement develop through alternative institutions and endowed professor's chairs.  Become a total conservative wonk-geek who will understand most of the oblique references you've read in National Review.  Read this book.	2002-03-09

I bought this book because of an enduring love affair with the literary works of Walker Percy.  As an addition to the literary biographies of Percy written by Samway and Tolson, the letters serve their purpose well.  As a letters volume on its own merits, The Correspondence of Shelby Foote and Walker Percy is unbalanced.  Apparently, Foote didn't start saving Percy's letters until the exchange had been occurring for some time.  Nevertheless, it is thoroughly interesting to observe Foote's massive ego as he lectures Percy, having the knowledge that Percy ultimately became the far greater literary star.  If you've already delved deeply into the work and history of Walker Percy, you'll need this book.  If not, find a different starting place, this is not a good place to begin.	2001-12-13
