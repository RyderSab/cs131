When he is kicked out of his uncle's house for his origins, Pran wanders the street and ends up in a variety of situations that take him across the globe.<br />The writing style was a bit overly-descriptive and enigmatic for my tastes, but Hari Kunzru is absolutely a gifted writer.  He has a real talent for poetic prose, and I would be interested in reading some of his Wired articles and anything he wrote as a travel writer.  I recommend this book to anyone that enjoys good writing and a tale that could easily be based on reality.  The story reminds me of that of Queenie, Michael Korda's retelling of his great-grandmother's experiences in India and abroad as an Anglo-Indian passing herself off as white.<br />I saw some complaints about the ending, but I felt it was appropriate to the story, although it might not have been decisive enough for many readers.  This was a very interesting book - I'm glad I read it.	2004-05-03

I read this book a month or so ago, and was really fascinated by the findings that Gladwell discussed.  If you're interested in the phenomenon behind Hush Puppies, various children's tv shows(particularly Sesame Street and Blue's Clues), crime waves and the spreading of various diseases pertinent to this era, read this book!  The author discusses how different trends spread by specific means.  See if you can spot yourself in any of the personality types he mentions - this is really interesting!<br />I borrowed this book from a fellow booklover at Bookcrossing, ([...]) which is a huge supporter of Amazon, so if you're interested check them out!  I'm glad I read it - I don't usually read non-fiction or case studies, but this book was a welcome exception.	2004-05-02

The lyrics to \\"All I Need\\" constantly flow through her head, and when she needs to calm herself down or is bored, she writes them down to make herself feel better.  It's funny, I remember thinking this song was just ridiculous back then, but obviously our tastes are a little different (my sing-it-in-my-sleep song was probably more like \\"Bizarre Love Triangle\\"). The cheesiness of the song, at least in my eyes, doesn't detract from the overall theme of the book, which is how can Eliza get out of the '80s and early '90s and into the 21st century.  Or wait, maybe that should be the theme?  Just kidding.  Actually, the author does a great job of sneaking in references to the 80's and 90's without making the story sound too retro.<br />I really enjoyed all of the references to popular trends from the 80's that I had forgotten, like Shrinky-dinks, Strawberry Shortcake, fluorescent clothing, and so many others.  They are all mentioned in the book, and it is worth reading to the end and holding onto just for that very reason.<br />It's funny, but I was able to relate to the rock star obsession.  How many of us can honestly say we weren't obsessed with a rock star at a certain point in time?  Of course there's a fine line between idolizing them and dating them, and many of us have crossed that line too.  The reasoning behind why Eliza continued to do this, but ended each relationship for silly reasons (remember Seinfeld?) was fairly sound.  I'm starting to think about how I carry myself and could be similar in some ways to Eliza - that has to say something in favor of the book.<br />The author is just terribly funny, and this book made a fairly good read.  It dragged in parts, but overall I was interested enough to finish it, mainly to get all of the 80's and 90's references, which are the highpoints of the book.  Pick it up for a great trip down memory lane!	2004-01-25

Liv Kellerman is a gutsy New York girl that has just left her husband, after finding out that he was cheating on her.  The worst thing about the situation is having to leave her beloved apartment, which she misses more than the husband.<br />So begin her adventures as a newly single newly professional woman.  Liv decides to go to realtor school and becomes a real estate agent.  Her exploits are so terribly funny - the author has real comedic talent!  I haven't laughed out loud with a book in quite a while, and this book actually had me tearing up at some of the situations.<br />Liv truly could be summed up with the words \\"high maintenance\\", which is how her ex-husband described her.  She meets some real screwball characters during her adventures in realty.  I highly recommend this book to anyone in need of a good laugh - it really does the trick!  I read the whole thing in about a day.  Enjoy!	2004-01-18

I read two of her books, \\"Mercy\\" and \\"The Pact\\", and although they were both very readable, I felt a little unsettled by the overall topics, and decided that I didn't need to read any of her other books.  I'm glad I received \\"Keeping Faith\\" and decided to give it a try.<br />What a great book!  Faith is the 7 year old daughter of Mariah White, a 32 year old woman that is in the middle of a painful divorce.  As she begins to settle into life as a single mother, her daughter starts to talk about seeing her \\"guard\\".  Miraculous things start to happen to others when Faith is around.  Of course, then the media and the clergy must investigate these claims, and create an ensuing scandal.<br />The story is told in a very interesting way, through journal-like dated entries and frequent changes of point of view.  I really enjoyed this book, and would recommend it as one of my favorites of the year.  I now look forward to reading more books by this author.	2003-12-31

This is a story about young prostitutes living in the seedier parts of London.  It also tells the tales of a young man that works at his father's perfumery, the young self-involved wife, the elder brother that has aspirations to join the clergy, and the people that move in their social circles.<br />The lives of William Rackham and his family change as the result of the actions of a young woman that William comes into contact with.  Read the book to find out more - I don't want to ruin a good surprise!<br />This book has surpassed \\"The Dress Lodger\\", in my opinion, in terms of character development and the literary prowess with which it has been written.  It has been written from the point of view of a master of ceremonies presiding over a theater show, and the author was devilishly clever in perpetuating this motif.  I could easily see it becoming a movie in the near future.  Read it now so you can brag about it later!  You are in for quite a treat!	2003-12-23

The Ryans, Kate and John, run a pub that is connected to their house and are busy with the raising of four young children.  We enter the scene as the neighboring mansion has been bought by an American developer of Irish origin.  He plans to replace the structure with a hotel of majestic proportions in hopes of replacing the legacy set by the family that lorded over his poor ancestors.<br />So the American entrepreneur transplants his motherless son and daughter to Ireland.  This is the tale of how the two interact with the neighboring townspeople, and how the family's arrival upsets the balance that has held in the town for many years.  Along the way some disasters, and a lot of learning, take place.<br />I enjoyed the depictions Rachel Fine, the interior decorator, and Sheila Whelan, the town postmistress.  Their good taste and discretion are qualities to aspire to.  I also learned a lot about certain types of cases and the strategies involved.  The book offered many pearls of wisdom, although at times the story got a little boring.<br />I was somewhat apprehensive in picking up this book because of all of the negative things I had heard about it from Maeve Binchy fans.  I gave this book 4 stars because the story is vintage Maeve Binchy, but if she wasn't one of my favorite authors, it would be more like a 3 star review. I believe from the writing style that this was one of her earlier works.  The editing leaves much to be desired, with scenes flowing into each other without her typical star divider.  With more editing, the book could have been made a little more palatable - at times I was wondering if it would ever end!  <br />But true to form, Binchy finished off the story fairly well and tied up some of the loose ends.  Overall I do recommend this book to faithful fans of her work.  Don't be afraid to skim through some of the pages.  I did that every now and then to move the story along.  Asit was, it took ages to finish, a lot longer than most of the books I have read lately.  Read this one if you dare, but keep your expectations low.	2003-11-22

This book is a murder mystery of sorts told by an autistic British teenage boy.  Christopher feels he has been framed for the murder of his neighbor's dog, and after the police take him away, he decides to find out who the real murderer was.  He begins to keep a diary of his conversations with his neighbors, and as he uncovers more information, he finds out some very interesting things.  Everything is not as it seems.<br />I really enjoyed this glimpse into the life of an idiot-savant gifted in math and science.  The diagnosis of autism has always intrigued me, and I remember doing a project on it in my masters' psychology program.  I am curious as to what part diet plays in the onset of the disease, as there is a theory that many of those diagnosed with autism actually suffer from celiac disease, and can be cured as a result of following a special no-gluten or processed food diet.  Just something interesting to think about.  I recommend this book to anyone looking for something outside the traditional story line.<br />The main character was slightly reminiscent of the Adrian Mole books, but that might simply be due to the subject matter.  Great book!	2003-11-09

This tale of a 15 year old prostitute living in the turn of the century London is just wonderful!  It is one of my favorite books of the year.<br />Holman tells the tale of the prostitute and a young doctor living through the times of the cholera epidemic.  It deals with many of the issues that surrounded the French revolution, namely the treatment of the poor by the rich.  Along the way there are many twists and turns.  Pick up this book - you are in for a treat.  Holman has created a majestic work of art that transports the reader back to the tenements in England and the imminent threat of cholera.  The book could have been so much darker - indeed, the subject is so dark, but the story is told in such a beautiful way that it makes this book a pleasure to read.  Possibly my first 10 of the year!	2003-10-17

This heartwarming tale of two sisters, separated over time by the choices they had made in their childhood, will warm your heart.  Meg and Claire, two sisters born to a negligent and selfish mother but with different fathers, have a very close bond until fate steps in and tears them apart.  When the book begins, many years have passed, and both have gone on to lead their own lives, but think often with regret of the events that separated them.  Each woman feels guilty for the choices she made, and blames herself for the separation.  The rest of the book details their struggles to come together again and resolve the issues that separated them to begin with, and to ultimately find happiness.<br />I don't know if this review does the book justice.  It is definitely my favorite of the four books I have read by Hannah, and marks a departure from the storyline she usually follows.  Even if you are not sure whether this book is for you, pick up a copy.  It remains one of my favorite reads of 2003.	2003-09-19

The main couple is the descendant of immigrants from other parts, that have come to the area to find a better living.  Materia and James have three daughters, and the story follows the struggles of each member of the family.  The eldest daughter, Kathleen, is a talented singer, and the second half of the book deals with the mystery surrounding the condition in which she returns from New York, where she has gone to pursue her singing career and take voice lessons.  Her two younger sisters must struggle to carry on after her death, and each of them deals with the tragedy in different ways.<br />The book starts out very pleasantly, but with time the story gets more and more disastrous.  It is a tribute to the author that such a sad saga is communicated in a very readable fashion - normally I would not even be able to finish a book that was so sad.  I highly recommend this book, even if you don't normally read sad books.  This one is the exception!	2003-09-19

I absolutely loved this book.  Mary Browne is apparently a fairly well known psychic, and she offers advice here in the form of cases from her files of clients dealing with life issues.  The book summarizes the tales of the woman that can't stop spending money, of other women that feel they would be better off leaving their husbands for the men they are having affairs with, and many other interesting stories.  Browne also discusses the issues of reincarnation and karma.  She specifically goes into the effects on one's karma from various actions, which is interesting and believable, even if the concepts of reincarnation and karma are not ideas you believe in.  <br />The most interesting point of the book for me was the specifics she provided on going through past lives.  For anyone that is interested in this kind of thing, you must pick up this book.  I have already recommended it to one friend, and I believe she enjoyed it greatly.  I need to get my mom to read this book, and plan to read more books by Mary Browne.	2003-09-18

Binchy goes into the lives of their parents, and the events that make all of them the way they are and do the things they end up doing.  All of the characters' stories center around the copper beech tree in the schoolyard, where the children spend their formative years.  The author magically creates an entire town based on the glimpses into the worlds of a few of the major characters, and during the time you are reading the book, you will be sucked into the lives of its people.<br />I greatly enjoyed this book.  I gave the book 4 stars because it did not quite approach the magic of Binchy's book, \\"The Glass Lake\\", although it came very close.  The format of the book might not be popular with those that felt her most recent book, Quentin's, was too superficial, as each chapter in this book deals with a different character and what is going on their lives, in a similar fashion to the aforementioned title.  However, all of the characters in this book interact in different ways, and it is wonderful to see how the actions of some are perceived by others.  It serves as a great reminder that what goes on behind the scenes is frequently different from the story told by appearances.	2003-09-18

It is a great story about Helen McMahon, a young mother living in Ireland in the 1950's.  When the story begins, Helen is wondering how her life got to this sad point.  Her family, made up of her husband, Martin, and her children, Kit and Emmet, thinks that all is well.  One day she disappears, and the story has begun.  It is a surprise to everyone in town that she had suicidal tendencies, as no one ever saw her act anything but cheerful.  The consequences of her disappearance stay with her family and influence their lives from that day forward.<br />We find out what happens to her family, and how they cope without this very important element.  There are some major twists and turns along the way for her family, and indeed for other people close to them in the town of Lough Glass (the Glass Lake of the title), but suffice it to say that this is a book you do not want to miss!  Maeve Binchy has done her absolute best work with this book, and it would be quite hard for any other author to top - it remains one of my favorite books of all time.  And I know I'm not alone in rating it so highly.  <br />My summary does not really do the story justice, but I'm trying to give you enough information to want to read it without giving the whole story away.  There is a lot more to the story, believe me, but you will have to read the book or other reviews to find out what happens.  &quot;The Glass Lake&quot; is truly an excellent book!	2003-09-12

When the story begins, Sarah is about to take a special flight to celebrate her cancer being in remission.  She enjoys the flight so much that she decides to retain the services of the pilot, Will Burke, to take her to Elk Island.  She left her hometown years before, but has decided to make the trip back to see her long lost father and the son she left behind.<br />Along the way, Sarah ends up bonding with Will and his daughter, Susan, and the trio help each other with all of the issues they are facing.  I rated the book 4 stars because I'm not a big fan of romance, but in spite of my tastes, I really found myself enjoying the story and wondering what would happen next.  If you are new to Luanne Rice, this is a great book to get your feet wet with.  Rice is a wonderful source of comfort reads, and this book is no exception.  If you are in the mood for a comforting and inspiring story, read &quot;Cloud Nine.&quot;	2003-09-12

'Pi' Patel is the young son of a Zookeeper in Pondicherry, a French settlement in the south of India.  His imaginative antics save him from the torments of his classmates and make for quite an interesting story.  Pi is inquisitive, and soon decides to investigate Christianity and Islam, although he is raised in a Hindu family.  This leads to enlightening discussions of the three religions, and some very funny events.<br />My favorite part of the book was the information on training animals.  I learned a ton from Pi's stories about the animals in his father's zoo, and the ways they were tamed.  The only criticism I have is for the story of his adventures with the animals on the boat, which I felt was too long and detailed, but toward the end it is evident why the author put so much detail into the story.  The ending is delightful, and completely changed my rating from 4 stars to 5.  A word to the wise - the second half drags a bit, but the ending will make it worth slogging through all the extra words.  Don't miss this book - I can only imagine all the prizes it will win!	2003-08-28

I was very pleasantly surprised when I finally started reading it!  Although the authors admit that the incidences described are taken from more than one employer, it still makes a fascinating story.

It starts off with a lot of seemingly random observations, but the story builds with time.  The narrator leads such a colorful life - her personality is reminiscent of Adrienne Eisen's &quot;Making Scenes&quot;, which is another really good book.  I highly recommend it.

Paullina Simons is a master storyteller, and has created a work of art with her latest novel.<br />This story is reminiscent of &quot;Dr. Zhivago&quot;, but I prefer &quot;The Bronze Horseman&quot;.  I saw &quot;Dr. Zhivago&quot; recently after reading this book, and wondered what all the fuss was about!  Her books would do quite as well as movies.  I'm very glad to have come across this book and this author.  <br />The only one of her books that I did not like was &quot;Eleventh Hour&quot;, more for the subject matter than anything else.  It's hard to make a story about the kidnapping of a pregnant woman upbeat or inspirational.  That is the only Simons book I would not recommend.  If you only read one of her books, make it &quot;The Bronze Horseman&quot;!	2003-07-12

I picked up this 1300+ page book with a little trepidation, thinking there was no way I would get halfway through the book and still be interested in the story, but I was wrong! As I got farther into the book, the story got even better!<br />Vikram Seth takes us into the time of post-partition India. The country has just been split into two, and all of the characters in the book are dealing with the aftermath as they struggle to go on with their lives. I do not mean to imply that the book is depressing - there are a few sad situations, but it was written in a far different vein from Rohinton Mistry's A Fine Balance.<br />We are immediately introduced to the Mehras, the Kapoors, the Khans, the Tandons, and the Chatterjis. The daughter in the Mehra family is marrying the eldest son in another family, and his sister is married to the son of another family, and so on. During the wedding, the topic of Lata Mehra and finding a suitable boy is brought up, and the story progresses from there.<br />Along the way we met a whole host of characters - Kabir, the charming cricketeer, Malati, the wild best friend, Maan, the wild brother-in-law's brother, just to name a few. You will love reading about the comically caricatured Chatterjis, who tend to speak in rhyme. I could almost imagine this family as the star of an Indian sitcom (with English subtitles, of course).<br />This story is truly a saga in the greatest sense. I really loved the way the author interspersed elements of religion, history, politics, and culture in a way that will appeal to readers of all kinds. I found myself skipping through a few of the political discourses, just because the writing is almost too detailed at times and I can only take political discussion in very small doses. It was quite an educational book - I learned so much about Hinduism and Islam that I didn't already know, and also about different cultures. I even picked up a few new phrases in Hindi and Bengali.<br />As a first generation American with Indian parents, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about Indian history, culture, politics, you name it - especially other 'abcds'. I could see it being an invaluable resource in schools for classes studying the history of India, although a person that doesn't have background knowledge in the history, culture, languages, and/or religons, might find it a little boring at times and harder to follow.<br />This book has a little something in it for everyone - Seth has created a wonderful story that is quite lighthearted most of the time, although it covers very serious topics that are still issues in the Asian Subcontinent to this day. I can't wait to read his other books!	2003-07-09

She feels like she has finally gotten lucky with Abe, the first man that seems to be more into her than she is into him.  When Abe asks her to go on vacation with him, Lydia begins to believe she has finally won the jackpot.  This book is the story of their trip to the islands, and the catastrophe that befalls them, and seriously makes Lydia wonder how well she knows her boyfriend.<br />The story starts off a little slow, and gets better after the first couple of chapters.  I would recommend it as a light summer read - I picked it up from my sister's room when we went home for the weekend and I needed something to read at night.  The writing style is fair, and leaves a little to be desired, but the characters and plot tie together fairly well to a decent conclusion.  <br />I tend to base my ratings on a combination of readability and how I feel after I have finished the book.  I rated this one a little lower because it took a while to gather my interest, although it did pick up with time.  I don't have a strong feeling one way or another about it now that it is done, though.  All in all, a cute little book - check it out if you find it on sale or happen to have a copy lying around..	2003-05-06

I finished the book within 2 days, which says a lot about how readable it is.  Don't miss out on the story of a young girl unhappily married to an older man in Holland.  The lives of the couple and their servant are disrupted when a painter is invited into their home to paint their portrait.  There are some surprising plot twists that will keep you guessing.  The book also has some great information on tulips, which just happen to be my favorite flowers.  I can't recommend this book enough!	2003-02-27

This is the story of four friends that meet as young mothers in a park in Cincinnati.  Vicki, Chris, Barbara, and Susan all have young daughters and live on Grand Avenue, hence the name of the book.  They become closer with time, and help each other through various trials and tribulations.  This book is definitely not for the faint of heart - it starts off pleasantly enough, but the subject matter gets dark fairly quickly.  I had to put it away several times because it was a little too depressing to take in all at once, and might not have finished it if I had had something else to read.<br />I loved Fielding's book &quot;The First Time&quot;, and because of that and the great reviews for this one, thought I would like it just as much.  I will definitely find out more about the next book of hers that I pick up before I read it.  Not to say that this was a 'bad' book by any means, but the overall tone is somewhat tragic, and if you're not in the mood for this kind of book, you might want to stay away.  I am glad that others were able to enjoy it - we won't all like the same books.  If your tastes are similar to mine, though, consider yourself warned...	2003-02-22

I had been wanting to read this book for some time, since it had been recommended by so many people in one of my book groups. I read &quot;Watermelon&quot; by Keyes 3 years ago, and found it a little too light for my taste, but was simply blown away by this book. I could easily see it being made into a movie. If you want the story to be a total surprise, and would rather not hear anything about it ahead of time, then stop reading right here, or just skip the next paragraph - I don't want to ruin the plot for anyone.<br />The book relays the experiences of Rachel, the younger sister of Claire's that was barely mentioned in &quot;Watermelon&quot;. I found the book to be stunningly insightful, not just about addiction, but rather so many basic topics surrounding self-esteem. I really feel that this book has a little something for everyone - that might just be my awed opinion, but if you didn't care so much for Watermelon, don't let it discourage you from reading this book. <br />I was thinking that everything I had heard about &quot;Rachel's Holiday&quot; must be hype, and that I would be disappointed, but I definitely was not. I was actually very impressed with the author's research into this subject matter, and the great readability of the book. Don't miss this one!	2003-02-08

This is a fun story about a young professional, her best friends, and the dating scenes they find themselves in.  Marian Keyes can always be counted on for a feel good book about a young woman that triumphs over hard circumstances to reach the goal in the end, and this book is no exception.  It's amazing how she manages to take this common theme and make it so interesting and enjoyable every time, but pick this book up - you will not be disappointed!  I haven't heard of a single person that did not like it.	2003-02-08

US	52425128	R103HGDDWK1WRO	1552790401	621617431	The Total Man	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Very entertaining! - Review posted at Scribesworld.com	\\"The Total Man\\" is a great resource for anyone wanting to put some life and passion back into their marriage.  It is written from the man's point of view, but the author is a woman who has created an excellent parody of a popular self-help book for women entitled \\"The Total Woman\\".  The latter advises women to do whatever it takes to keep their husbands happy, even if it means sacrificing their own happiness.  \\"The Total Man\\", on the other hand, points out that a healthy marriage is the product of two dedicated people, and that without the husband's support, a woman that works and comes home to take care of all of the housework and child rearing duties will have a hard time feeling fulfilled. The book analyzes some key issues in marriages from the working woman's point of view, but could be applied to any relationship, whether both spouses are working or one is at home while the other supports the family.<br />The author also offers some great practical advice as to child rearing, exercise, and spirituality, in addition to general tips on how to make one's spouse feel special and loved.  She accomplishes all of these things while also keeping the book short, to the point, and highly entertaining.  This reader enjoyed all of the anecdotes relating to marriage, and how formerly dysfunctional couples were able to put the spice back into their relationships.  You'll have to pick up the book to find out how it was done, but suffice it to say that the vignettes make it quite an interesting read.	2003-01-05

I was recommended this book in several book groups last year, and it honestly seemed like 18 out of the 20 people that had read it absolutely loved it. I figured, with those odds, who can resist? This book was just as good as I had hoped it would be.<br />We follow the journey of Clare, of 20th century nurse that accidentally time travels to 18th century Scotland. Once she gets there, she meets with adventure after adventure with an outlaw named Jamie that she meets by accident. There is a little something for everyone in this book, from romance, to intrigue, to horror - you name it, the book has it! I was hooked the entire time I was reading the novel, and would recommend it to anyone. I really look forward to reading the others in the series.	2003-01-05

The latest Binchy is the 'triumph over tragedy' tale of young Ella, who starts seeing a married man, and later begins to ask herself how much she really knows about him and his family.  It was a bit slow at times, but did carry through somewhat to a satisfying ending.<br />I really enjoyed the frequent reference to past Binchy characters such as Simon and Maude, Tom and Cathy, Ria Lynch, Brenda and Patrick, etc. The story leaves a little to be desired when compared to her earlier books, but it is written in true Maeve Binchy form, where even the worst can't be that bad.	2003-01-05

India Edghill has done a stellar job of bringing to life the story of Princess Michal - the wife of the great King David.  The character portrayals are wonderful, very complete, and the dialogue she has created defies the imagination.  <br />This is a truly inspirational book in the way it has brought to life a biblical tale that I had only the vaguest knowledge of.  Michal was not a name I was familiar with, and although I remember reading the tale of David and Bathsheba in high school when we studied the Bible as a work of literature, most of the story was very new to me.  I was spellbound for the 2 days it took me to finish the book - I really cannot recommend this one enough!  I enjoyed it much more than &quot;The Red Tent&quot;, I'm not sure why, but that is what I felt.  If you find a copy of this book, do pick it up!  It is a masterpiece!	2002-08-01

It provides a quick glimpse of small town life, and all that is good and not so good about growing up in a town where your last name says it all to anyone you meet.<br />Maddie, the main character, is faced with some shocking events that start to bring her out of the shell she has lived in all her life.  I really enjoyed this book for the little bits of insight it offers into human nature and what makes people tick.  I could not put it down, and finished the whole thing within a day - I decided the dishes, laundry, and errands could wait!<br />I picked up this book and another book, 'Welcome to Temptation', by the same author, several months ago, on the recommendation of some women in my various book groups.  It does not disappoint - I highly recommend it for a quick, fun read!	2002-07-25

Deborah Curtis did a great job with this narrative of her life with the former frontman for Joy Division, her husband Ian. Her story offers fantastic insight into the band behind the scenes, and also some tragic recounting of Ian's descent into depression and the reasons behind it.  She goes into a lot of detail regarding her personal life, and shares things that most would have trouble sharing, and for that she is also to be commended.<br />I have been intrigued for years by the music and mystery behind New Order, and the book answered many of the questions I had as to why events unfolded as they did. Excellent job, a must read for any die-hard New Order fans out there!	2002-05-06

This book is a great resource for pet lovers to use in dealing with any behavioral problems their furry friends display. I would recommend it to anyone that owns cats, dogs, birds, or horses - tons of good information on what makes these lovely animals tick.<br />Based on the recommendations in the book, I bought \\"Rescue Remedy\\", and use it every now and then on my little dolls, Gigi and Lulu. It quickly soothes and relaxes them - works great!  I wish I'd found this stuff before!  This book also discusses bach flower essences, and which ones might be best for your animals, based on their behavioral problems.  Gigi used to be a holy terror, and she's become the sweetest cat since I started retraining her.  <br />Definitely check this book out if you are a pet lover!  Another great herbal resource to try - prescription for nutritive healing, herbal meds.  I will never take non herbal medicine or go to a non-holistic doctor again, if I can help it.	2002-05-06

For those of you open to new age thoughts and beliefs, this book is a godsend, it contains information that I have been searching for and have not been able to find anywhere else.  Go on to the third paragraph for my review.  <br />The book was loaned to me by my chiropractor, so if you're skeptical about nontraditional methods of healing, read no further, this review would be a waste of your time, and mine.  Do not vote negatively just because alternative healing falls outside your religious beliefs, you are not doing anyone a justice.<br />For those of you that are still reading, this book is a wonderful introduction into the science of energy and healing.  Myss goes into the chakras and how certain health issues can stem from specific kinds of stress and/or emotional blockages - it is well worth a read.  I'm reviewing the audiocasette version, but her style is graceful enough that the actual book should be just as easy to understand.

I'm not a big Anne Tyler fan, and actually bought the book because I got it [at a good price] and thought it was by Anita Shreve (says a lot about how many books I bought with it - bet you can't guess!)  But luckily my local library had the audiobook version, and for those of you that are my familiar with my reviews, you know that this is a very good thing!<br />Nice story, although the characters are fairly unlikeable. I really wanted the main one to just get a backbone and a brain, but maybe I'm being overly harsh.  Fairly painless to listen to, and the writer is excellent at portraying the insides of characters, and making them very true to life.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if any of this was autobiographical.  Very decent book.	2002-04-26

This book completely changed the ways I view everything that is important in this world - I really can't recommend it enough. It's one of the books I always make sure I have extra copies of to give to anyone going through hard times, particularly the death or impending death of a loved one. There is nothing else out there that could be more effective when it comes to grief counseling and inspiration, the chicken soup books really pale in comparison! Read it even if your life is perfect, trust me, it will get even better! Throw all the other self-help books out and just pick up a copy of this book. If you can't get ahold of one, message me and I'll send you mine, it's that good!<br />I hate to even touch on any kind of negativity, but just because this book did not ring true for you does not mean it is not helpful to others - please think twice before you vote negatively for people that endorse it.

The dialog is so realistically clever, if I had them I'd give the book 3 thumbs up - I know it sounds corny, but it's true.

Of course, it could have just been my mood, who knows with these things?  I'd almost give it a 4, the story loses it's overwhelming depressing tones near the end, but for me it was much too late to redeem the book overall.

I had heard from several people that it wasn't as good as Angela's Ashes, and I found that to be true.  However, it was a lot less depressing, and for that, it deserves some praise.<br />McCourt has so many great stories - and you just know that the ones in the book are just from the top of his head, and that there are plenty more where they came from.  It was also very nice to see that the family was able to escape the misery that was evident from the first book.<br />Overall, a good book.  I would definitely recommend it, although not the abridged audio version, which was the format I found first.  I later found a printed version to compare it to.  <br />A few things are left out that should have been kept in - nothing too crucial, but what are a few extra minutes here and there?

This experience reminded me of the time I read \\"The Remains of the Day\\" by Kazuo Ishiguro - the book and the author received much acclaim, but I really wish I had skipped over the book and watched the movie instead.  <br />The words do flow off the page quite gracefully, but there just wasn't enough 'action' to keep me interested - I ended up finishing it because I was reading it for a book group.  If I hadn't had a motive, I might have just dropped it and moved on to something more exciting.  I've heard it being compared, to \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\", which I loved, and because of that, I decided to pick it up.<br />I tend to enjoy dialog a lot more than description, which there might have been too much of in this book.  I wish I could 'savor' poetic writing, as Oprah does, but I guess it's just not my thing.  If you also prefer more action, you might want to pick up another book instead of this one.<br />The reviews in my book group so far have been fairly mixed.  Everyone seems to have either loved it or set it aside for the same reasons I mentioned.  My expectations might have been too high, or maybe I'm just in a big hurry to move on to the next book, as I have a couple more I need to finish by a deadline that is fast approaching.  Whatever the reason, I'm so glad that I borrowed a copy, rather than spending any money on it.  A nice book, but not one that will stand out in my mind in years to come.	2002-01-26

I just found the family so despicable in their handling of such a delicate situation, and although I'm sure this kind of thing happens far more often than we'd like to believe, that doesn't make it any easier to take.  In my opinion, it started off well, and then just dragged incessantly once I got halfway through it.  So it wasn't just the subject matter - if the writing had been different, I would have found it much more palatable.  I'm sorry I bought it.	2002-01-20

According to the publisher, Prechtel previously published two non-fiction books, but this is his first work of fiction.  Although the story starts off as a simple tale, it is soon apparent that there is much more behind the scenes than was evident at first glance.  For a wonderful and concise summary of the content, please read the review below this one - I could not have said it better myself, so I won't even try.<br />The tale is the probably the easiest part - deciphering the several layers of deeper meaning is where the experience becomes much more complex.  There are a few passages that come to mind that I have already outlined, and I definitely plan to read this book again in the future.  I would recommend that anyone, like me, is not well-versed in complex philosophical thought, read the explanations behind each layer in a couple of sessions rather than all at once.  The material is a bit much for the average reader, particularly people that, like me, are mostly used to reading works of fiction, but that should not detract from its appeal.  Of course, much of the discussion covers some universal truths, and everyone could stand to pick up some valuable lessons from the book.  This is a book that I don't plan to get rid of anytime soon.  Check it out, if you dare..	2002-01-20

I was so pleasantly surprised when I picked up this book last year and starting reading it. I thought it was just a silly beach read, and figured I would read a few pages just to say that I had given it a try, and then give it back to my sister to return to her friend. I loved it! The character is just so outrageous in parts of it! Sure it might not be the most realistic book in the world, but look at the title - does it say War and Peace??<br />I felt that, considering the subject matter, it was VERY well done. I was so excited to find out that a sequel to it just came out - that one went right on my wishlist. If you shop, and as some other reviewers put it, sometimes feel guilty about overdoing it, this is absolutely the book for you! It's a little fluffy, but if I owned a copy, it would never be on the shelf - I would constantly be passing it around to people. Not your typical 'British bachelorette drinks and shops' book - I liked this one SO much more than Bridget Jones.	2002-01-20

Sure, it's a chick book, but it's an Oprah pick, so that goes without saying.  Wonderful story, masterfully told - kinda sad, but incredibly readable!  I haven't heard a single bad comment about it yet, and it's been out for a little while now.  If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would...Don't miss this one - it's a real gem.  I would pick up another book by this author in a millisecond, no matter what the subject, title or length, she's that talented.	2002-01-19

I picked up the book a few times, but am so glad I also chose to listen to the story being narrated.  Atwood is amazingly creative with her storytelling, but there were a few parts that she could easily have left out to make the book a little more compelling.  The narrator also did a wonderful job with all of the voices and various accents, and really made this book a winner in my eyes.<br />I was one of a few people that did not like The Handmaid's Tale at all, but I'm so glad that I decided to follow someone else's recommendation regarding this book, and give her another try.  If you're a fan of her work, by all means, pick up the actual book, but if you have never read anything by her and aren't sure if you will enjoy her writing style, the audiobook version is your best choice.  It's a virtually painless way of getting the full effect of the book, and makes the not so interesting parts much easier to take.  I have copies of Cat's Eye and The Robber Bride at home, but I think I will definitely see if I can get ahold of the audio versions to start me off.  In my opinion, there's a little something in there for everyone - what a great book!  I can see why it won the Booker Prize.  If you're thinking about reading it, by all means, pick it up!	2002-01-19
US	52425128	R2DVR61AEBCETC	0451191153	594264062	The Fountainhead	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Fabulous - one of my alltime favorites!	I absolutely loved this book, and I'm thinking that I'm going to love the other Rand books I have yet to read.  This book is quite philosophical, so you are looking for a beach read, mystery, or simple romance, look elsewhere.  It is not for everyone, but if you read the first few pages, you will probably either find yourself hooked, or put it away fairly quickly.  <br />I was supposed to read this book as part of a special program in the third grade, but I'm very glad that I didn't, I probably would not have understood even a tenth of it.  The theme of the book is fairly serious, and as I mentioned before, very philosophical, so I doubt I would have gotten the full meaning back then.  It's a huge book, but I spent every spare minute I had reading it, and it just took me a couple of days.  It is a wonderful book and provides a very insightful look into the human spirit in its various forms, and how it can either shape or be shaped by society.  I already have my copy of Atlas Shrugged, and will undoubtedly be reading it soon.  If you are a fan of Ayn Rand's books, don't miss this one!  If you're not, you probably won't like this one either.	2002-01-15
US	52425128	R1V4852DMULLZV	1588511855	834052238	The Legacy	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A wonderful, heartwarming tale, reviewed for MyShelf.com	The Legacy is a heartwarming tale about a twenty-something orphan's adventures in the Big Apple. If you want the plot to be a total surprise, skip down to the last paragraph.  Maggie Claydon's earliest memories are of the San Sebastian Children's Home in Florida where she grew up. She leaves the home at the age of 18 to strike out and make her own place in the world. Maggie works for a few years and lives simply until she receives a mysterious letter that convinces her to move to New York City and start a new life.<br />The introduction to the story is very cleverly done. When we are first introduced to Maggie, she is an old woman tending her garden when she becomes the victim of a sudden heart attack. The story then starts out from the beginning with an event that changes the course of her life forever before she is old enough to even realize what has happened. Later on, through her interactions with the kindly Mrs. Everhart, and Sean, the kind policeman she encounters in New York City, she is able to put her tragic past behind her, and move toward a future she can look forward to.<br />This book is a story about Maggie's search for family and how she finds one that becomes larger than she could have ever dreamed of. I loved the way the book was old-fashioned in parts, and very contemporary in others. Mrs. Cadelo has done a wonderful job of knitting together two very different writing styles into an entertaining and inspirational story that shows the reader that sometimes through helping others we are able to find the very things that elude us.<br />...	2002-01-15

It's very simply written, so do not expect this to be a typical NYT bestseller like the one you read last week.  I believe this book was written in the '40s, and although much of the vernacular in the book is obviously of a different period in time, it has a timeless and universal appeal.  I haven't even finished it yet, but have already decided, enough with the library version, I want my own copy so that I can use the advice it offers later on in life.  Don't miss this one, and make sure you tell your friends about it, so that they can come and thank you later, and you can say &quot;I told you so&quot;.	2002-01-12

If you enjoy British 19th century literature, you are sure to like this book.  I read it for a book group selection, and am so glad I was able to get a copy of it.  The dialogue is so wonderfully witty, and full of meanings that are not immediately discernable to American readers that are less familiar with this more formal manner of speaking, as I was.  I still enjoyed it, as the story is a romantic comedy that I feel has a little something for anyone that enjoys a good romance.  It is definitely more subtle than the kinds of things one reads these days, but that seems to be a good thing.  The BBC televised version with Colin Firth is also very good.	2002-01-05

If you're looking for something short and sweet, particularly around the holiday season, it does the trick.  I found the plot a little farfetched at times, though, and do wish that I'd gotten it from the library rather than as a free literary group selection.  I was anxious to read, but now feel like I wasted my choice, and should have gotten a more substantial and thought-provoking book.	2002-01-05

I had been wanting to read this book for some time, since it had been recommended by so many people in one of my book groups. I read \\"Watermelon\\" by Keyes 3 years ago, and found it a little too light for my taste, but was simply blown away by this book. I could easily see it being made into a movie. If you want the story to be a total surprise, and would rather not hear anything about it ahead of time, then stop reading right here, or just skip the next paragraph - I don't want to ruin the plot for anyone.<br />The book relays the experiences of Rachel, the younger sister of Claire's that was barely mentioned in \\"Watermelon\\". I found the book to be stunningly insightful, not just about addiction, but rather so many basic topics surrounding self-esteem. I really feel that this book has a little something for everyone - that might just be my awed opinion, but if you didn't care so much for Watermelon, don't let it discourage you from reading this book. <br />I was thinking that everything I had heard about \\"Rachel's Holiday\\" must be hype, and that I would be disappointed, but I definitely was not. I was actually very impressed with the author's research into this subject matter, and the great readability of the book. Don't miss this one!	2002-01-05

It was loaned to me by a friend  who had borrowed a few of my books and was wanting to reciprocate.  When  she first gave it to me I was not at all excited, but once I picked it up I  honestly could not put it down - even at work sometimes!  I had thought her  books were very philosophically surreal, but this book was very real and  very easy for &quot;non-philosophical&quot; types in addition to those who  are constantly in search of a higher meaning.  Do keep in mind that it is  an emotionally wrenching book, and other than that you need no introduction  aside from what is on the back cover of the book.  I look forward to  reading Atlas Shrugged and Fountainhead, once I am able to get over this  one and the lessons it teaches have sunk in completely.	1998-10-08
