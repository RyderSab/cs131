The color photographs are artistic and original (mountains, lakes and trees give Gurche more than standard post card poses).  The writing is likewise consistently excellent.  Huschke offers a taste of history, geology, and human interest with his hiking and, of course, nature commentary: he seems consistently well-informed.  In addition, the book gives a sharp, though not detailed, map of each wilderness area.  This puts hikes I have taken, or dream of taking, into a context one cannot always quickly grasp from detailed topographical maps. I found Huschke's description of trails I know, like the maps, not only accurate but also detailed in a useful, rather than overwhelming, way.  So I feel I can trust his guidance where my own sneakers have not yet trod.  At the same time, he doesn't make me feel as if actually hitting the trail for myself would be redundant.  <br /> <br />Of course there are many other trails in each wilderness area this book does not describe.  But this is a wonderful introduction to the awesome beauties of Washington state, both for those who have never visited, and for those born here, but with much left to discover.	2005-10-02

History has often been changed by people who stood alone for truth against power: Solzhenitsyn hiding his writings from the Soviet secret police, Benigno Aquino stepping onto the tarmac at Manila International Airport, a lone Chinese man facing down tanks.  Frank Peretti shows, in this prophetic novel, how such courage might affect a news anchor who meets God.  Like the prophets in the Bible, \\"John\\" is in for a rocky road.  Peretti does an excellent job of telling the story from a Biblical point of view (in particular, the writings of John the apostle), while presenting the skepticism and cynicism of worldly observers through the eyes of other characters. <br /> <br />Peretti also describes a family in conflict well: godly (but very domestic) parents with a worldly but loving son, and a grandson (Carl, product of a broken family), trying to sort things out.  Sometimes a few people act out of character (and did Carl really need a haircut once he was saved?), but generally the characters are good.  By toning the supernatural elements down, I think Peretti only makes his story stronger.  He depicts conflicts in the newsroom well too.  (A couple days after I finished, I found myself interviewed by a reporter from the station I think Peretti modeled Channel 6 on.  I found it easier to feel for him as a human being.) Perhaps Peretti exagerated the dangers of abortion to the mother.  After reading this story, I wonder if we would ever know.   <br /> <br />Ultimately, this story is about truth, and how dangerous and unwelcome it is.  \\"Men (and women) love darkness, because their deeds are evil.\\"  Peretti describes how love of darkness leads to sin, self-deception, cover-up, and hatred of those who call darkness by its right name.  I find his description not only biblical, but true.  I just finished writing a book on \\"Why the Jesus Seminar can't find Jesus,\\" and found a baffling miopia about elementary and obvious facts among many skeptical scholars.  For a lucid and informed description of how sin and self-deception can lead to judicial and political injustice, I recommend the work of political philospher Jay Budzicewski.   <br /> <br />Peretti challenges us greatly.  He does not promise that everything will work out if we do what God calls us to do.  But he shows the effect our choices have on forming who we become.   <br /> <br />It was fun to see \\"The City\\" modeled on my hometown, Seattle.  Some of the place names were changed, some not.  We do have very left-wing, \\"pro-choice\\" politics, and slanted news.  One change was a bit unbelievable, though: it is hard to imagine anyone here putting up with such a blow-hard governor.  Importing California actors to toot his horn wouldn't help, either.	2005-10-01
US	30581570	RDWBT6EMUYVPF	0691119503	804778133	For the Glory of God: How Monotheism Led to Reformations, Science, Witch-Hunts, and the End of Slavery	Books	5	121	129	N	N	An essential book.	If I were going to pick ten \\"must read\\" books out of the two hundred or so I have reviewed for Amazon or in print, this brilliant work would be near the top.  One of the others was Stanley Jaki's Savior of Science; Stark treats Christianity and science in far more detail and more convincingly than Jaki, and three related aspects of religious history just as well.  Your education is not complete, and may be defective, until you have come to terms with Stark's arguments.   <br />  <br />Stark makes four main arguments.  First, faith in God leads to quarrelsomeness (what someone referred to as the \\"joy of sects\\") and to reformations.  (Brilliantly contrasting the \\"Church of Power\\" and the \\"Church of Piety.\\")  Stark has some very interesting insights deriving from Adam Smith about what happens when a religion has a monopoly, and what happens when (as in the US) there is a free market of spiritual ideas in effect.  But he somehow manages to spin his sociological theories without impinging on individual human choice. <br />  <br />Second, Stark argues that faith in God encouraged Christians to invent science.  Having read other books making the same claim, I think Stark's approach to this question is one of the best.  Not only does he go over the development of technology in the so-called \\"Dark Ages,\\" and show how the \\"Enlightenment\\" picture of Copernican era science is a myth, he studies 52 key early scientists, and shows that more than 60 % were \\"devout,\\" while only 2 were skeptics.  The critic below who asks why Christianity did not produce science in Russia did not read attentively: Stark argues that faith in God was a necessary, but not sufficient, cause of the rise of science.  Other factors were also involved.  True, he does goes on quite a tangent (10-15 pages; but in a 400 + page book) on evolution.  But even there, he finds some interesting things to say -- I didn't know the story of the debate between Huxley and Wilberforce was untrue, for example.    <br />  <br />The third section of the book gives a detailed, and I think true, explanation of the witchhunts.  \\"Anti-Semitic violence, persecution of heretics, and witch hunts were collateral results of conflicts between major religious forces\\" (ie, Islam and Christianity).  I do not think this \\"denigrates\\" or \\"trivializes\\" the idea that witchhunting was an act of \\"social solidarity,\\" as is claimed below; in fact Stark looks in detail at such community-level causes as well as the \\"big picture.\\"  (See the works of Rene Girard for fascinating insight on \\"scapegoating\\" in general, a concept that may help bridge Stark's approach and the \\"social solidarity\\" approach.)  Stark also points out that the witch hunts claimed less than one in a hundred as many victims as often alleged, that it was not enlightenment figures, but inquisitors and a Jesuit, who first spoke against persecution of \\"witches,\\" and that early Christians like Augustine thought belief in witches was pure superstition.   <br />  <br />Finally, Stark shows how Christians put an end to slavery, beginning in the \\"Dark Ages.\\"  His discussion of this subject is more complete and detailed than any I have read.  As with his treatment of science, he draws from a wide array of sources, and gives facts and figures when possible.  (How much England paid to free the slaves, the percent of abolitionists who were pastors, and so on.)  Along the way, Stark takes his favorite hobby-horses in the sociology of science out for a handsome trot across the landscape.   <br /> <br />Finally, let me offer a rebuttal to recent critism.  The previous reviewer complains of Stark's many errors.  Unfortunately, the only example he gives (calling the Dao Dejing by the name of its author, Lao Zi) is not a mistake.  I have a copy of the book on my shelf in Chinese with just that title; both titles are now used.  Calling a philosophy book by the name of its author was standard in ancient China: the Zhuang Zi, Xun Zi, or Mencius.   <br />  <br />Another critic (who may or may not have read the rest of the book) rants angrily against Stark's attempt to set the relationship between Christianity and persecution of witches in a more context.  She calls it \\"the dumbest thing I ever heard.\\"  But contrary to what she seems to think, Stark does NOT say witches worship the devil, rather: \\"the concept of satanism was deduced by leading Church intellectuals.\\"  The critic also suggests we ask a modern witch.  Good idea.  Neo-pagan historian Jenny Gibbons has written an on-line article that admits, with embarrassment at such sensationalism in the New Age community, many of the very points Stark makes.    <br />  <br />The \\"militant skeptic\\" below gives a fairer review, and may have caught Stark out in a minor error or two on a periferal subject.  (I haven't read Libanios.)  But I can find such micro-flubs in most books, even my own.  In a book of this scope and detail, that is hardly reason to grade such a sweeping, and empirically tested, argument down.  Stark often gets big facts I am aware of right where many or most writers get them wrong.   <br /> <br />Contrary to what some seem to assume, this is not a text of apologetics. I recently saw Stark quoted by a skeptic, assuming he was one of their own.  An honest arbitaire, like the Jesuits of Paraguay whose remarkable story Stark tells, may get it from both sides.  Don't let niggling criticism dissuade you from reading this brilliant, essential, and deeply enlightening work.   <br />  <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2005-09-22

If you enjoy playing with Monopoly money, like to count clam shells at the sea, are impressed by the beauty and fine worksmanship of a barbie doll, or can find nothing better to do in the evening than read old real estate listings, then this may be the book for you.  The hero has a heart of paper, his number two squeeze was xeroxed from a fashion magazine by a machine that lost what soul was left, and not a single interesting place or thought or person occurs anywhere.  Money shifts hands, and falls seemingly from the sky.  Lawyers lust over big airplanes.  Some get rich and drunk and argue.  People fly off to an island paradise that might as well have been a sand box at the local playground, for all the attention it sparks.  (No, I take that back.  My boys found much more fascination in a sand box.)   <br /> <br />I have enjoyed several of other Grisham's novels, and am surprised at how hollow this one turned out to be.  In his other books, he described a small town in the south through the eyes of a seven year old, and I was captivated.  He caught some of the charm of a city in northern Italy and could grasp what an alcoholic might feel when he found God.  I even enjoyed his grinch-like main characters and the bitter fun of Ditching Christmas.  But this one lacks all charm.   <br /> <br />Perhaps Grisham wants to tell a morality tale about the seductive evil of vanity and riches.  Problem is, his hero and heroine are as cardboard as the model he saddles the one with, and the blow-hard developer Dad he trussles the other up with.  Who cares what happens to them?  And the story ends as flat as it begins.  (Then Grisham throws one of his \\"I don't take my research seriously, why should you?\\" postscripts at us, to add insult to injury.)   <br /> <br />One might I suppose salvage from the wreckage of this novel a bit of pity for the rich, and for the author.  As Chesterton observed, life is romantic because we are unable to control it; the rich, having the luxury of forming their worlds, often live in the lap of tedium.  This story is terribly predictable.  And my dog has more personality than all its characters put together.  But for any real enlightenment or even enjoyment, read Christmas Carol instead: that's how to describe the decay of rich fools.  <br /> <br />author, Why the Jesus Seminar can't find Jesus, and Grandma Marshall Could	2005-09-18

If the improbable, romantic history of Christianity in China doesn't convince you that \\"truth can be stranger than fiction,\\" what can?  Last year I visited the lovely stone pagoda outside of Xian, what remains of the oldest Christian complex in China, where an ancient stone telling the story of the first Christians was found four hundred years ago.  Poetic Chinese Nestorian texts blending Buddhism and Christianity were later discovered in caves hundreds of miles towards Afghanistan along the Silk Road.  After the long hike to China, the participants in this early meeting of East and West deserve two things: a thoughtful and informed introduction, and the chance to speak for themselves.<br /><br />Riegert and Moore provide the latter, but not the former.  The second half of this book consists mostly of exerpts from the various discovered texts.  These are fascinating and often beautiful; sometimes leaning towards Gospel, sometimes towards dharma, at times agreeing with both, occasionally with neither.  I have a copy of the Nestorian scroll; difficult Chinese, for me at least, but the translation here seems fairly plausible.  While it might be too much to hope for a copy of the original in this popular treatment, I wish they had at least said where they obtained their tranlations.  They are quite different from those in Palmer and another available on-line, but no explanation is given of where they came from.<br /><br />The texts are fascinating, poetic, and often beautiful.  By contrast, Riegert and Moore might have written the introductions in a couple afternoons, and drummed up the research for them in a few days.  It is not clear that the authors knew a lot about China, or Nestorian Christianity(making them sound like members of the Jesus Seminar), though it is obvious they were fond of Buddhism.<br /><br />One of the book's key errors appears culpable.  The authors claim to be offering \\"1300 year old scrolls\\" from China.  No hint is dropped that the texts they offer might differ in character.  But in fact, the Nestorian stone is 1250 years old; the scrolls are more recent.  (According to Palmer.  The authors do not argue with him; they just fudge the distinction between the stone and the scrolls.  As I recall, Samuel Moffett, whom the authors quote, also points out that the stone reveals a more orthodox Christianity than later scrolls.)  The authors are either simplistic, or disingenuous, to confuse later syncretism with the first Chinese Christian text, which appear pretty orthodox.<br /><br />While I think his enthusiasm for karma and other dubious ideas is naive (see my review in Books and Culture), Martin Palmer's The Jesus Sutras is a better and more interesting book.  (Perhaps because it was written for love, while I rather suspect this short, artsy little volume of having been written for money.) There is room for more books on the subject, but I hope the next person who takes it on will approach the interchange of syncretism, dharma, and Gospel, with deeper and more critical thought.<br /><br />author, True Son of Heaven: How Jesus fulfils the Chinese Culturethat the texts they offer might differ in character.

I was pleasantly surprised at both the quantity and quality of the evidence Geisler and Turek presented in this book; I guess I was expecting \\"Young Earth\\" material and a repetitious gloss of points made by Josh Mcdowell. (I borrowed the book from a church so conservative you half expect a moat and a drawbridge as you walk in the door.)  <br /> <br />Some points negative reviewers below make hit the mark, I think.  One can criticize the tone at times; the authors do look to be \\"stacking the deck\\" a bit. (Though the writing is generally good, and the illustrations are often amusing, and add clarity to the points they reference.)  Like some other readers, I found the biology a bit spotty, (the astronomy a bit better), and some arguments from philosophy too abstract to persuade fully.  For instance, how can illness be a result of the fall of man, when fossils deformed by sickness can be found from millions of years before human beings existed?  It is also true that one must discuss chemical evolution to refute the idea that life arose through natural processes.  (For a really first-rate and respectful discussion of this issue in depth, see Rana and Ross, Origins of Life: Biblical and Evolutionary Models Face Off.)  Geisler and Turek follow C. S. Lewis in taking a philosophical approach to miracles, asking in effect, \\"Could miracles happen if God exists?\\" But it seems to me that the better question is, \\"Do miracles, in fact, happen?\\"  I think an empirical argument for miracles much strengthens the case for Christianity: for many people, including me, the Bible seems more credible because they have seen evidence that miracles do in fact happen.   <br /> <br />But all in all, the authors have crammed a rich feast of mostly telling evidence for the Christian faith into the book's 400 pages.  Many of the points they offer, even on science and philosophy, are effective. And the \\"historical Jesus\\" section (140 pages) is excellent.  Either the skeptics who claim there is nothing new in this book have read a lot more than me (and reading books for and against the Christian faith is both my hobby and vocation), or they have overlooked some of the good stuff here.   <br /> <br />And looking over their criticism, I think the latter is more likely.  Several critics assume that Christian faith means \\"a firm belief in something for which there is no proof,\\" or that religion \\"tells us to ignore reason and accept faith.\\"  Having just completed a historical study of Christian thought on faith and reason from the 2nd Century to modern times, I would argue that this is not at all what Christians usually mean by faith.  In fact, as physicist and theologian John Polkinghorne points out, faith in the Chrisitian sense is arrived at by means rather similar to scientific hypothesizing.  Another critic implies that the Big Bang is popular among laymen, but not scientists.  Nonsense.  Another complains that Geisler and Turek describe Buddhism, Hinduism, and the New Age as \\"pantheistic,\\" though Buddhism can be atheistic, and Hinduism polytheistic.  Actually, the authors say \\"some forms\\" of Buddhism are pantheistic, and (page 198) Hinduism is \\"pantheistic and polytheistic.\\"   <br /> <br />The authors and their critics are however both wrong in overlooking theism in non-Western cultures.  Geisler and Turek describe Confucianism as \\"atheistic,\\" though Confucius himself believed in God, as did his most important, and many later, disciples.  Theism is also common in other non-Western cultures.  (See chapter 9 of my Jesus and the Religions of Man.)  The almost universal awareness of God is one evidence against the claim, also advanced below, that theism is some kind of a subjective cultural accident.   <br /> <br />Finally, another critic claims that none of those who wrote the New Testament personally saw Jesus.  Actually several of the authors of the New Testament say they did, and (despite radical criticism) there is good reason to think they did.  (See my Whythe Jesus Seminar can't find Jesus, and Grandma Marshall Could, for an in-depth rebuttal of such modern criticism.) <br /> <br />G. K. Chesterton said that an open mind, like an open mouth, is meant to be \\"closed on something solid.\\"  If you are just looking for reasons to gripe, you can probably find things to criticize, even to mock, here.  But if you are looking for solid truth in which to sink your cognitive canines, and are willing to consider evidence for the Christian faith, you can find a lot of good evidence in this book (and elsewhere) that deserves a careful taste-test.	2005-08-27

While this collection may be much the same as God in the Dock, as the reviewer below says (several essays seemed fresh to me), it has been out for almost 40 years.  Since the publishers have probably retired, and the statute of limitations on greed has run out by now, I'll review the book on its own merits.  (If it's novelty you're looking for, try the brilliant, humorous, and sometimes quirky Lewis letters collections that Harper San Francisco printed last year.  Practically no one seems to have read them, and they delighted me for a month or two.) <br />  <br />Seeing Eye is not a New Age revision of C. S. Lewis, as the title might make you think, but a motley collection of thirteen mostly thoughtful, deep, and iconoclastic essays.  Some sound as if they began as a school assignment -- \\"Can we have something on ethics or Christianity and culture?\\" and then Lewis attacks the assigned topic with his usual clarity of thought and erudition, usually taking it, and us, somewhere unexpected and deeply revealing.  \\"The Funeral of Great Myth\\" gives a (possibly premature) encomium, with measured appreciation and skepticism, on the myth of evolution (in the trans-scientific sense) that dominated late 19th and 20th Century thought.  \\"Historicism\\" is a highly useful analysis of the meaning of history, or whether history has a meaning.  Lewis' essay on the Psalms is included; though I think it better read with his book on the subject.  (Lewis was not a fideist, and gives the Psalms what some might feel is rough treatment.) The essay \\"Petitionary prayer: a problem without an answer\\" considers two types of request to God in Scripture: those that add \\"your will be done,\\" and those that do not.  Lewis considers whether our timidity in prayer derives from true humility, or lack of faith, and whether the Bible promises more than God delivers from prayer, and decides (with commendable honesty) that he doesn't know.  Lewis also writes \\"on futility,\\" on Christianity and culture (anotherfoundational piece of thinking), subjectivism (an early defense of what he calls the \\"tao\\" in his prophetic Abolition of Man), and religious language (scattering insight and understanding like my yellow lab scatters river water after a swim).   <br /> <br />\\"Modern Theology and Biblical Criticism,\\" elsewhere called \\"Elephants and Fernseed,\\" in which Lewis attacks skeptical New Testament scholarship, may be the most brilliant and (for some) helpful piece of all.  If you haven't read it, this essay alone is worth the price of several heftier volumes.  As I show in my new book, Why the Jesus Seminar can't find Jesus, and Grandma Marshall Could, modern critics continue to repeat the errors Lewis describes.  His essay therefore continues to be not merely useful, but indespensible, if you find yourself bamboozled by the likes of John Crossan, Elaine Pagels, Marcus Borg, or Bishop Spong.  (Though of course I also recommend my own book.) <br /> <br />If you haven't read these essays and feed deeply on the truth herein, and this is a convenient edition for you, be sure to acquire a copy.	2005-08-15

Every president at least since Franklin Roosevelt has been in the pocket of corporate America.  Roosevelt had to prod the Japanese into attacking us, and of course knew the attack was coming.  Truman dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to scare the Russians, even while forcing poor old Stalin into a confrontation that the Soviets didn't want.  Osama bin Laden was chosen \\"on aesthetic grounds\\" as the latest member of our \\"enemy of the month club.\\"  Apparently the Cheney-Bush junta was expecting 9/11, needing it to justify the conquest of Afghanistan.  They \\"leveled\\" that sorry country only to let Union Oil of California to build a pipeline across it.      If you can buy any of this, and like your paranoia served up on a rhetorical silver platter, there's a good chance you'll enjoy this book.  But if you want reasoned argument, at best you will find Vidal's arguments tedious, at worst a sad form of narcicism. His \\"evidence\\" is the stock circumstantial evidence and out of context quotes of the conspiracy theory, and his techniques those of the propogandist.  (Which, as a student of comparative religion, I have often seen before.)  Run out in front of a car to save a stranger's life, and one sort of person will call you a show-off, or assume you have vile designs on the life you saved.  Vidal views the American government like that.  He engages in what Paul Mankowski (reviewing his book on another subject) called \\"monotonously mirthless tittering.\\"  Here, the objects of his titters are presidents of the United States, from Roosevelt to Bush II, and the figures in dark rain jackets who stand behind them, or hoover above them in black helicopters.      What makes this book most tedious, to someone like myself who has spent much of his life studying Soviet and Chinese societies, and living in East Asia, is its narcicistic focus on American society.  It was America's fault that World War II began (sort of) at Pearl Harbor, and that it ended at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  We were to blame for the Cold War (Joseph Stalin was apparently a placid, easy to get along with individual, unlike that mad haberdasher, Harry Truman), for Vietnam, Osama bin Laden, and Saddam Hussein.  I find the demonology monotonous, not to say improbable, and the \\"evidence\\" trumped up and absurd.  Vidal and his fans protest that he is not \\"anti-American.\\"  Be that as it may.  But hatred seems to be his great solace, and he chooses objects to despise (as he put it) on aesthetic, rather than moral or rational, grounds.  All in all, a sad warning about the state a human soul can reach.      Walker Percy may have been thinking of Gore Vidal when he commented that Alexander Solzhenitsyn was the \\"secret envy of American writers.\\"  \\"Despite their most violent attacks on the state and the establishment, nobody pays much attention . . . least of all the state.\\"  Solzhenitysn, by contrast, took on the Soviet Leviathon, and defeated it.  He faced genuine torture and a thousand deaths, wrote brilliantly, and enjoyed the further advantage of writing about real, rather than imaginary, crimes.  I strongly recommend that readers who are attracted to this sort of thing read him first.	2005-08-13

One of my goals this year is to decide whether biology provides a good argument for God -- in particular, to evaluate the claims of the Intelligent Design movement.  I just read Robert Pennock's Tower of Babel, which purports to give evidence against ID, but doesn't, really.  Pennock offers arguments from analogy of doubtful relevance, and trash-talks his opponents, Johnson in particular, with a sophistication that seems primarily rhetorical.  In one sense, this volume turns out to be a good book to read next, since Johnson replies to some of Pennock's arguments.  (He easily refutes Pennock's argument from linguistic evolution, and pokes a hole or two in his computer analogy as well.)  But all in all, the book further confirmed my growing skepticism about Johnson's role in the debate.   <br /> <br />First of all, I am weary of all the trash-talking on both sides.  Shut up and argue, already!  Show your opponents the respect they deserve -- all these men are intelligent, informed, and in some regards at least informative.  Give facts and evidence, showing by the balance of your presentation that you care about truth above all.  (A good model of how such a debate might look is Rana and Ross' Origins of Life: Biblical and Evolutionary Models Face Off.)  Like Pennock, Johnson too often hits below the belt.  Neither so much argues the other side wrong, as assume their error, then explains the deviant psychology that led into such sins of the intellect.  (Along with Pennock, Johnson's main targets are Dawkins, Gould, Kenneth Miller, Daniel Dennett, and an unknown scholar of yesteryear named Philip Wentworth.)  Johnson is not attacking a straw man: he does get in some good licks on his targets.  But it often has the feel of an angry game of rhetorical ping-pong, rather than an earnest search for the truth.      <br /> <br />It seems to me that some on both sides believe their theories because they honestly think the evidence favors them.  And others, like myself, want to know which the evidence does favor.  To such folks, this book is likely to prove extremely frustrating.    <br /> <br />Wedge of Truth also seems to confirm Pennock's observation that Johnson is influenced by a post-modern view of truth.  This may be why, rather than showing why his view is true, he dishes up psycho-political explanations of why the evolutionary  <br />\\"establishment\\" has such warped thinking on the subject.  It may also be why he is so coy about what ID is not, playing footsie with Young Earth folks, etc, with whom he probably does not really agree.  No doubt there is some truth in post-modernism, and that truth is embodied in Christian skepticism about the human heart.  But the Gospel teaches us to be skeptical of our own hearts, too.  The two forms of apriori skepticism cancel one other out, and we come back to the neglected problem of evidence.   <br /> <br />I have written three books arguing for the truth of Christianity, including from the occurance of miracles and from the life of Jesus, so I am not one of those Christian scholars Johnson rebukes for caving in to methodological materialism.  And as another cantankerous Dr. Johnson put it, \\"the greatest part of our knowledge is implicit faith.\\" But if this Johnson wants a scientific revolution, he needs to explain exactly what he thinks happened, make an explicit and detailed case for it, and refute (with some generosity of spirit, if possible) arguments for evolution, such as those given by Mayr in What Evolution Is, rather than merely taking pot shots at the most fallacious reasoning on the other side.   <br /> <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2005-08-12

Chesterton wrote: \\"The thing which keeps life romantic and full of fiery possibilities is the existence of these great plain limitations which force all of us to meet the things we do not like or do not expect.  To be in a romance is to be in uncongenial circumstances.  To be born into this earth is to be born into uncongenial circumstances, hence to be born into a romance.\\"<br /><br />Skipping Christmas is a romance, hence about uncongenial circumstances.  Of course Grisham lays it on thick (This is a satire, critics.  In satires, one exagerates.  Got that?), both about the dark side of Christmas, and about the Kranks' neighbors. (Whose ideosyncracies, along with the schmaltzy and exploitative elements of Christmas that Grisham so over-does, define the limitations that entrap the Kranks, and create romance.)<br /><br />Personally, I love Christmas, and have never had intrusive neighbors.  But I recognized just enough truth to enjoy the exagerations, and the dry, slightly dark humor, and \\"ho-ho-hoed\\" my way to the end.  (Listening to the tape, read with just the right, slightly bitter, edge.)  And being a romantic at heart, I was also pleased with the highly romantic, though this-worldly (this is not a fairy tale, as another critic seems to expect) ending, an apocalypse of goofy good will to all.<br /><br />Maybe this book is not for all Grisham fans, or all fans of Christmas; perhaps it takes a certain humor.  But I also appreciate the way Grisham explores the romance of limits, even the romance of a \\"hum drum\\" middle class neighborhood. To quote Chesterton again: \\"We make our friends; we make our enemies; but God makes our next-door neighbor.  Hence he comes to us clad in al the careless terrors of nature; he is as strange as the stars, as reckless and indifferent as the rain.  He is Man, the most terrible of beasts.\\"<br /><br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Manof Man	2005-08-08

You may get the impression, from many reviews below, that \\"No Man\\" is a work of angry polemic, \\"twisted\\" and \\"fabricated\\" with hardly a word of \\"positive information\\" about Joseph Smith.  It did not seem that way to me.  Brodie's tone seemed far more judicious and moderate than that of most critics, and her research extensive and thoughtfully sifted.      If you expect a white horse, a zebra's dark stripes will surprise you, but if you look for a black horse, his white stripes will likely catch your eye.  My impression of Joseph Smith was pretty negative, before reading this book, which may be why it seemed more positive to me than to many Mormon readers.  I had noticed parallels between Smith and \\"religious revolutionaries\\" like Mohammed and Karl Marx; Brodie persuaded me though that unlike them, he was not a violent man by nature.  I knew Smith manipulated women, and (like Mohammed) quoted God to justify hoarding them; Brodie showed that he also seemed to really care for his (first) wife, and defer to her at times.  From the Book of Mormon, and one rather wild sermon, I got the impression that Smith completely lacked literary talent; Brodie again argued me wrong.  (\\"Now he was developing into a preacher of uncommon talent.\\")  All in all, while I still think him a scoundrel, Brodie forced me to modify my prior impression of Joseph Smith in a more positive direction.      It is human nature to make excuses for successful tyrants: criticism of Marx or Mohammed usually draws the same ire as many reviews below display.  Brodie is mildly affected by this weakness.  Brodie tells of disreputable deeds, or quotes words that sound a bit mad, then follows with a paragraph that says in effect, \\"Boys will be boys,\\" insisting on (and arguing for) Smith's greatness despite such contrary evidence.  But for her, the facts seem to come first; interpretation is kept distinct.  All in all, she has written a fascinating, readable, and fairly believable work of historical narrative.And what a story she has to tell!  If you doubt truth can be wilder than fiction, ponder this tale of the \\"peep stone\\" artist who invented a theology, founded cities, recreated polygamy and polytheism almost from scratch, wrote an alternate history of the Americas and persuaded twenty million people to believe it, and died in a shootout with a lynch mob, leaving dozens of grieving widows.       While Brodie shows that Smith was not inherently violent, the story does confirm other commonalities that struck me when I studied Marxism, Islam, and the Tai Ping Rebellion in China.  She describes Smith's theology as a \\"potpourri\\" of influences; true of the ideological genius of Mohammed and Marx as well.  She relates the evolution of Smith's thinking on economic \\"communism.\\"  Parallels between Smith's \\"revelations\\" about the use and control of women, and those of Mohammed and the Chinese visionary, Hong Xiuquan, also emerge.  Lyman Wight's description of unbelievers as \\"devils, infernal hob-goblins, and ghosts\\" is also closely paralleled by the dehumanizing language of the Cultural Revolution and the Tai Ping movement.      author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2005-08-01

One of my goals this year is to read both sides of the ID debate and decide whether or not biology furnishes an argument for the existence of God. (I have found evidence for Christian beliefs in other fields, some given in my books, Jesus and the Religions of Man and Why the Jesus Seminar can't find Jesus and Grandma Marshall Could.) Naturally, I expected this book to provide arguments against ID, since that is what the subtitle promised.       It doesn't, much.  Pennock (and some of his readers) seems to be under the impression he has written a book full of evidence against ID.  In fact, very little shows up.  He takes Philip Johnson, not Behe or Dembski, as his chief protagonist, and in a sense he is Johnson's doppleganger.  What the book mostly offers is arguments on various philosophical issues related to old and new \\"creationism,\\" along with quite a bit of sophisticated name-calling and mud-throwing.  (Much of which could easily be tossed back.)      Something about Philip Johnson's writings had bothered me; perhaps it is a \\"post modern\\" lack of seriousness about the truth, as Pennock claims.  But I wish Pennock himself had focused on the more substantial ID arguments.  Given the subtitle, the book seemed like a long series of digresssions, along with weak and highly questionable arguments from analogy.       Pennock begins with a heavy caricature of \\"creationists.\\"  He offers us an extended, disparaging, and I think weak metaphor about the \\"evolution of creation.\\"  At first I wondered if Pennock could't tell the difference between changes wrought by natural forces and those brought about by intelligence; but in the last few pages of the book, after he has squeazed the last drop out of the metaphor, he tosses it and admits that new creationist \\"mimes\\" appear \\"by design.\\"       After this introduction, Pennock goes on to suggest an analogy between the evolution of language and of the species.  This is interesting but cannot really be construed as evidence for anything; for one thing, Genesis doesn't even say all languages were created at Babel, and for another (as Johnson points out in reply, and despite the Amazon reviewer) proponents of ID don't start with the Genesis account, anyway.       Pennock's claim that ID is determined by theology is weak even given the evidence he choses to focus on.  But if you read the autobiographical accounts of say Hugh Ross or Michael Behe, this is quite false: for better or for worse, Behe and others did NOT come to ID through religion, but through science.  Pennock repeatedly obscures that plain historical fact.  His attempts to show that ID is \\"really religious,\\" which distract us again into politics and education, become tedious if the real issue is (as it is for me, and the cover led me to believe it would be for Pennock) scientific evidence.  The author is, I think, cheating.  (The Amazon reviewer, as usual, proves himself incapable of providing a balanced review of a book on religion.  He readily accepts Pennock's claim that ID is \\"more about biblical innerrancy than scientific evidence.\\")  Also, if ID is the issue Pennock wants to pursue, as the subtitle further suggests, he is just mucking up the issue again by wasting several chapters on Henry Morris and other \\"Young Earth Creationists.\\"     Pennock also spends a lot of time and energy describing the \\"evolution\\" of creationists tactics, and of language.  Aside from the limits of these analogies, which Pennock admits late in the game, another problem is that anyone can play that game.  One could equally well describe the increasing sophistication of evolutionary explanations, from ancient Greece on, in terms of \\"evolution\\" or \\"design;\\" another distraction from issues of substance.  So, too, his protracted argument about the New Age Raelian sect.  Pennock shows that the Raelians and creationists both argue against evolution; so what?  Stalin and (I guess) Hitler both believed in evolution: does that make it false?       Yet again,Pennock takes on creationism in the classroom.  He goes so far as to say people who disbelieve in evolution are \\"ideologues\\" who should not teach kids.  This seems a little unfair, given that the university as an institution was invented by \\"creationists,\\" and that thousands of excellent schools around the world were founded by these folks.       A few months ago I substituted in a middle school biology class in which a film on evolution and the Galapagos was being shown.  The film calmly showed how the booby chick murdered its sibling, explaining the wisdom of this evolutionary strategy.  If any child of a Columbine aura happened to be sitting in on that class, would Dr. Pennock feel entirely at ease with the possible implications he might draw?  Would it really be so terrible, at a point like this, for students to be affirmed in any faith they may have that gives even non-scientific reasons not to \\"go and do likewise?\\"       Finally, when Pennock got to actual scientific arguments (which took a while), I found myself only mildly impressed.  I am not sure he quite gets Dembski's concept of complex specified information, or the argument against the prebiotic assembly of proteins, etc.  (See Rana and Ross, Origins of Life, in particular.) Pennock's \\"wrong number\\" reply does not answer Dembski's real argument on the point.            His computer analogy was well stated and emotionally persuasive, but one needs a stronger basis than argument from analogy.  Also, one might conclude from that example that organisms ought to all \\"devolve\\" into simple bacteria.       In addition, Pennock's assumptions about faith and reason (274-5) misunderstand Christian thinking on the subject.  I can state that emphatically, because I just completed a historical study of what key Christian thinkers have said on the topic.  (...)Anyone who agrees with Pennock that it is a Christian virtue to \\"hold on to faith come what may\\" (like the reviewer who says \\"religious belief is a matter of faith not proof\\") does not I would suggest understand the mainstream, nuanced Christian view on this issue.       Most of Pennock's logical points seem reasonable.  (Though he mistates what is and is not ad hominem on page 363.))     All in all, I found the book worth reading, though often misleading.  Pennock did not deliver what he promised, but provided a good challenge to Johnson, in particular.  Hopefully other evolutionists will offer more scientific substance; I will continue to look.	2005-07-18

I found a copy of this version of Snow White in the school library in Japan where I was teaching, and took it home to read to my boys.  Later, I photographed the pages and showed slides to my Japanese students, using these illustrations to explain the surface, psychological, and spiritual meaning of the Grimm's stories.  Of Grimm illustrators, I think Hyman is best, and while her illustrations of Rapunsel, Living Water, etc, are wonderful, this is her most inspired work.      First of all, the paintings take my breath away.  Unlike the Disney figures, one can understand why the Mirror on the Wall thought these two ladies beautiful, and why the prince fell in love with Snow White!  Hyman uses light brilliantly, beautifully, and with subtlety.  Wow!  My students liked them, too.       Also, Hyman seems to be one of those rare souls who picks up on the spiritual level of the Grimm tale.  None of the other reviewers has mentioned the allegorical nature of Snow White, and I don't want to ruin the story for anyone.  But if this interests you, pay close attention to numbers, temptations, candles, the mirror, especially the final mirror image, and the face of the King's Son.  Hyman has drawn so subtly that it is possible to entirely overlook this quality and thoroughly enjoy her art, as an atheist may enjoy, say, the Chronicles of Narnia.  Nor am I even sure she was a Christian.  But she may have picked up on something intended by the Brothers Grimm.  (For details, see Ronald Murphy's The Owl, the Raven, and the Dove: The Religious Meaning of the Grimm's Magic Fairy Tales.  Or see my upcoming article in Books and Culture, \\"How the Brothers Grimm Overthrew the Evil Empire.\\")      Lay all that aside, though, and this is still one of the most lovely children's books I have ever read.     author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2005-07-03
US	30581570	R3R2TTYKLD9BCQ	0802847722	59192637	The Savior of Science	Books	2	41	55	N	N	Crotchetty and unsatisfying.	As a Christian historian, I tend to agree with many of Jaki's points.  He also owns a certain intellectual brilliance -- I found myself ear-marking many pages, to return and write down  juicy quotes.  The problem is, Jaki refuses to support his arguments with enough facts.  The book often comes across as crotchety, dismissive, and even egotistical.  Jaki is brilliant perhaps, but he doesn't give critical readers a chance to be persuaded.  Instead, he rambles relentlessly, skipping from Justice Bork to Darwin to Arianism to sollipsism.  Not always does he explain his point clearly, and seldom does he back it up with enough solid facts.  Part of this follows from attempting two thousand years of history in 230 pages.  But like G. K. Chesterton, Jaki also seems to feel an actual aversion to detail, though without Chesterton's humor, good-naturedness, or psychological acuity.   <br />  <br />I found Jaki's point about the rise of science weak as an argument, though possibly true.  Are wrong worldviews to blame for the stillbirth of science in ancient non-Christian civilizations?  That is a provocative thesis, worth exploring.  But a few paragraphs of dismissive and elusive discussion (6 for Egypt, 10 for India, 15 for China, 4 for Babylon, 8 for Greece, 5 for Islam) should not be enough to satisfy even fellow believers.  Given that science did in fact happen to rise in the West, of course one can find post hoc reasons why this should be so; but to prove that it HAD to be so would take a far more in-depth and detailed argument.   <br /> <br />I was even less satisfied when I noticed that, while he got some things right (about ancient theism, for instance), he made a few errors about one civization I know fairly well, China.  I think Jaki overstates the influence of Confucianism and Taoism on public Maoism; of all the books Mao sold as a young man, only one came from traditional China; all the rest were Marxist and foreign.  Jaki is just ignorant when he asks, quoting Bertrand Russell, \\"if . . . this youthful vigor in the Chinese mind was in fact very old, why was it 'often very difficult to interest even the most reforming Chinese in afforestation?' And if the answer was that . . . reforesting vast tracts of bare hillsides was 'not a subject for ethical enthusiasm,' how could Confucius . . . be presented as a model of modern, reform-minded Chinsese?'\\"  In fact Confucius' greatest disciple, Mencius, wrote passionately about protecting the environment, including forests.  (Taoists also described the stripping of the environment as a sin.)  If modern Chinese have not followed their example (and they haven't, until recently), neither did many other early industrial societies. Jaki's attempt to reduce this question to theology is either simplistic (if I understand him) or vague (because I am not sure that I do.)  Marx and others reduced civilizational causation to material forces, and that is wrong; but we should not respond with an equally simplistic argument reducing everything to spirituality.   <br /> <br />Jaki's take on modern science is also titilating as an appetizer, but unsatisfying as a full meal.  His discussion of Buridan, a name I did not know, is interesting, when he finally comes to it.  But his grumpy discussions of Descartes, Darwin, Einstein, etc, seem longer on invective (and on airy and sometimes insightful assertions) than on convincing evidence.   <br />  <br />All in all, I doubt anybody who did not already agree with Dr. Jaki would be persuaded by this book.  It is probably worthwhile to read, if you hold Jaki's many insights in your hand without grasping.  But if we're going to persuade the world of the life-giving value of the Gospel, I think we need to speak more generously, and in more detail.  Stephen Barr's Modern Physics and Ancient Faith, and Peacey and Thaxton's The Soul of Science, fill in some of the missing detail, though admittedly with less flair.  On the larger cultural argument, see also the works of Vishal Mangalwadi, and (also very brief) chapter 7 of my Jesus and the Religions of Man, entitled \\"How has Jesus changed the world?\\"	2005-06-26

Enjoying the advantage of not having read Smith's previous works, I had few expectations coming in and found the story pleasant and interesting. (I listened to the tape.) One thing I liked was to see contemporary issues and life examined through past wisdom and insights; I think this lends a depth to the story.  I also enjoyed the heroine's slow-paced social life, her kindly sense and humor, and the Scotch brogue with which the narrator on the tapes brings out the different characters.  The heroine is a bit like G. K. Chesterton's Father Brown, only using philosophy in place of theology, to understand the world and solve problems.  (Indeed, I couldn't help but reflect that many of the principles in her \\"applied ethics\\" also came up in Sunday school.  Apparently George Bush's favorite political philosopher was pretty versatile.)  <br /> <br />Don't buy this book if you're in a rush.  It is not driven by the plot; in fact, it is not driven at all.  It is, rather, like a leisurely walk through gardened bourgoise allyways, interupted by a gossipy chat with the neighbor about current happenings, and a pleasant spring vista or two.   <br /> <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2005-06-25

Dorothy Solomon has lived what most Americans would take to be an odd life, growing up 28th of 48 children in an \\"old-fashioned\\" polygamist Mormon family.  While the family story involves incest, lies, and murder, she portrays her father (stallion of the herd) as a kind and capable, if overwhelmed, man of medicine.  Solomon is a moderately good writer.  But she has not found a way to give this complex story a simple plot; it therefore meanders a bit, and the black hats and the white hats tend to get mixed, as do narrative threads.       All in all, I found the story interesting, and I think most readers will, too.  As a student of world religions, I also found it worth my while as fodder for larger questions Solomon leaves unexamined.  One thing that interests me here is of course the relationship between religion and sex.  Westerners tend to think of polygamy as odd, forgetting that throughout history, and in most cultures, it was normal for rich men, at least.  Curious, that Joseph Smith should reintroduce polytheism and polygamy at the very same moment.  As I showed in my book, Jesus and the Religions of Man, history has seen many sexual revolutions, from which society recovers more often than it gains; what is more odd is the staying power of our own long and fruitful experiment with monogamy, under the influence of the New Testament.       Another question that I find interesting here, is the relationship between faith and morality in general.  Contrary to some reviewers below, I find her portrait of her father fairly realistic.  \\"There are bad people in every religion,\\" yes, but there are also bad ideas, which corrupt even kindly people, or cause them to do unintended harm.  Like Gorbachev-era communism, modern Mormonism is the seldom-remarked story of predatory belief mellowed over time, taken up by men and women who took to heart the ideals abusive leaders mouthed, and mellowed or explained away the oppressive means by which they got there.  (While followersof more kindly gurus water down the holiness of their leaders.)  But the modern world seems too cowardly to honestly examine the differences between religions.  We prefer to talk vaguely of \\"fundamentalists\\" and \\"liberals,\\" as if all religions in their purest form taught the same thing!  Solomon does not open this can of worms, either, or explain why she remains a Mormon.  To a large extent, her life thus remains in part the story of an unexamined life.  But I am grateful she was bold enough to share as much as she did.	2005-06-20

Admittedly, it's been about twenty years since I read Dune, and I haven't read the first two volumes in this trilogy.  So I don't have the same basis for criticism as some other reviewers.  (Some of whom seem to have a screen saver of the Herbert universe on their minds.)  But I greatly enjoyed this book.  (Or series of tapes, I should say.) I often found myself leaving the car running after I'd arrived at my destination, to hear more.  The worlds were perhaps unimaginative -- no local color, really -- but this is a story about people and machines, not a galactic tour.  But I still found myself drawn into this strange, yet familiar, alternate world.  I don't recall that Dune was THAT much better.  Maybe some of the other reviewers are just burned out.	2005-06-20

While the narrator is a bit precocious, both in narrative cognition, and in his wide-eyed interest in sights that make my (almost) nine year old say, \\"SICK!,\\" in general, his are a good pair of windows through which to peer at the passing world that Grisham evokes.  Luke is a seven-year old son and grandson of cotton farmers.  It is a busy summer: aside from endless cotton, it involves murder, storms, baseball, awakening puppy love, snakes, and other adventures and problems.  One reviewer complains that the characters are thin.  I don't agree.  Grisham paints a world, as his characters paint a house.  He paints with regret and sadness, but also warmth and kindliness.  I find the portrait very believable.  The story is episodic, a little like an Old Yeller or Where the Red Fern Grows for adults, like them set in the rural south.  I think it is worthwhile, as the world prospers, modernizes, and urbanizes, to remember this lost world; and I am grateful for the chance to walk through it for a few hours.  I began reading Painted House along with about ten other books in the evening, but Grisham drew me into his world, and I finished Painted House first.

Origin of Life gets off to what seems to me a slow start; the least persuasive part of the book for me was chapter 3, which gave a \\"RTB (Reasons to Believe) Biblical Creation Model\\" that seemed to stretch exegesis to the breaking point in places.  Does the Bible really require that life must be \\"complex in its minimal form?,\\" or that the first life in particular be complex?   <br />  <br />Rana and Ross kick it into high gear though when they turn to science, which they discuss almost exclusively for the remainder of the book.  In fact, I have read few books as fascinating and illuminating as this one in the past few years: I learned a great deal about cell biology and the past history of the earth.  In addition, as many reviewers point out, the authors are scrupulously fair and respectful towards other scientists, even those with whom they disagree: no politics, cheap shots, or merely rhetorical victories are on display here.  You can tell they really love science; the book is fascinating because the authors are themselves caught up in the mystery and wonder of life history.  They make it crystal clear when the evidence is not yet conclusive, and what questions are currently under investigation.  (Michael in Pasadena could have followed their example and been more specific in his criticism, I think.)   <br />  <br />One point I wish they had explained more thoroughly, though, is why we should consider 100 to 300 million years a short time for early biotic evolution -- how many generations of bacteria can come and go in that period?  A trillion?  Also, though I am a Christian apologist myself, I find the Cambrian explosion argument a bit of a non-sequitor.  It seems to me that it is precisely when a new form appears that you expect most variety; compare the many phyla of the Cambrian period to the variety of early car manufacturers, or even evolutionary schemes in all fields after Origin of the Species. (Many of which have been weeded out.) But this is a minor point; usually when Ross and Rana seemed to overlook an objection that occured to me, they would bring it up later, and then answer it.  Whether or not their thesis is correct, it is one of my goals this year to figure out; but the book fascinating, in any case.     <br />  <br />Origin of Life is written for a general audience, and there's a very useful glossary in the end of the book, but it wouldn't hurt to have a chemisty text handy, too.    <br />  <br />Author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2005-05-22

A person who knows the thought of only his own time and country is like the frog in the Chinese proverb who looks at the sky from a well.  Shalit makes good use of Jane Austen and other voices of sanity from eras bygone, including Jewish tradition, to launch a revolution against one of the most provincial and demeaning errors of our day: the \\"boys (and girls) will be boys\\" view of sexuality, that the only problems with promiscuity are STDs and unwanted pregancies, and those can be solved.  She could have found a more holistic and human view of sex in other cultures as well as other eras, that aren't so nutty as our own in this particular way.        Admittedly, critics get in a few good licks below. Shalit repeats herself too much: the book should have been shortened by 20 pages.  She portrays men as tending towards rudeness, filth, and animimalism as pigs tend towards mud; which seems a bit over the top.      But Shalit writes well and boldly. Her stories are fascinating; and frankly, American adults deserve the scolding she gives.  Having unearthed strong supporting evidence that monogamy leads to better health, happiness, and even sexual fulfillment (for my book, Jesus and the Religions of Man), I also think the evidence is on Shalit's side. If I could, I might give a copy of this book to every high school girl in the country.  (As a teacher, I am often faced with displays of student immodesty.  Maybe I'd lose my job, but sometimes I would like to tell some of the girls, \\"You come to class dressed that way, and sure, you'll attract attention.  But I also hear you saying, 'I don't think much of myself, and don't expect you to respect me, either.'\\")     I am disturbed by the psychology professor below who found that in a class of 63, \\"The rejection of Shalit's ideas was total,\\" and described Shalit's argument as \\"a new way to debase women.\\"  What kind of Stalinist dictatorship yields such perfect agreement?  And how could college kids, evidently brainwashed or afraid to let out a peep of disagreement, know that there was \\"much more ('hidden') violence\\" towards women before the sexual revolution?  Check the census statistics for any state in the Union: the rate of sexual assaults, like every other violent crime, has skyrocketed since the 60s.      That sexual promiscuity ruins millions of lives is one of the most obvious facts about modern American society: the evidence is all around.  Shalit proposes a modest solution.  The really interesting psychological question is why that solution, echoing the wisdom of many ages and cultures, seems to bother some modern folks.	2005-05-11

Tolkien.  (A man so deeply conservative, one National Review commenter pointed out admiringly, that Shakespeare was too modern for his taste.) But Carpenter creates an honest and enlightening portrait of the reticent scholar.  One glimpses the soul of Tolkien in his stories.  Here, Carpenter introduces the childhood, school days, love, soldiering, friendships, and linguistic curiosity that helped frame that soul. The book was also somewhat helpful to me for a book I am planning on the spiritual and literary lineage to which Tolkien belonged, along with (I think) Wilhelm Grimm, Andrew Lang, and C. S. Lewis.   <br /> <br />Like Lewis, whose friendship with Tolkien owns a chapter here, deep and lasting friendships defined different periods of Tolkien's life.  Carpenter describes his school comrades and the interesting romantic story that led to his marriage.  (After which the curtain is mostly drawn, no doubt to Tolkien's satisfaction.) One can see from where Bilbo and his dwarves, and Frodo and his comrades, draw their synergy.  (And Carpenter also tells us the inside story of the Hobbit and LOTR.) One chapter that I particularly enjoyed was a kind of \\"day in the life of\\" walk through a day at Oxford. <br /> <br />I personally would have liked to read more about Tolkien's war experiences, as well as get a deeper feel for his family and spiritual lives.  Carpenter touches on these, but perhaps material was not available for a more complete exploration. And no doubt that is what mades this the authorized version.   Nevertheless, I felt as if I got to know the man better in this well-written and thoughtful biography.	2005-04-21

All of the protagonists in this book are sharp, knowledgeable (in some ways but not others), polite, and engaging.  The Christians probably \\"won,\\" though I am not sure whether that is because of laziness on the part of the atheists, or the inherent weakness of their position.  Of the primary debaters, Moreland is more on target intellectually, though less original.  All the secondary debaters made good points. <br /> <br />The besetting weakness of this book (ironically, Nielsen and Craig agree) is that Nielsen is too contemptuous of or bored with conventional arguments for God to engage them.  He thinks Hume and Kant have answered them in theory, why go to the mat on details?  (Nor does he even explain why their arguments were so forceful.)  Instead \\"God\\" is incoherent by definition, case closed.  He then blames Morehead and Craig (in a polite way) for the poor debate: Get over this proof of God thing, already!  His attitude was not much better in his debate a few years later with Craig.  Perhaps rather than debating God with orthodox Christians, Nielsen should have taken part in activities he liked, whether darts or snow-boarding.  Yawning in the face of your opponent is not only rude, it leaves the impression one lacks reason. <br /> <br />Nielsen's own argument was to me sometimes interesting, but seldom persuasive.  \\"It makes no sense to say something is indirectly observable if it is not at least in theory or in principle directly observable as well.\\"  Not only do modern theories in physics seem to contradict this dicta, in reality, we don't directly observe anything -- sensual images cascade to consciousness along a long series of photo-chemical and mechanical reactions, whose validity we cannot test directly.  In that sense, I sometimes wonder if God may not be more directly \\"encounterable\\" than anything in the sensual world. <br /> <br />Much of Nielsen's argument rests on the weight of abstract adjectives that apply more to the God of Advetic Hinduism thanof orthodox Christianity.  \\"You can't encounter a transcendent being.\\"  \\"An infinite individual is a contradiction in terms,\\" because an individual must be \\"distinguishable from other individuals and thus finite.\\"  But the Christian God, as opposed to Brahma, is not \\"infinite\\" or purely \\"transcendent\\" in the senses that his argument require.  Nielsen is likewise fond of the word \\"anthropomorphic,\\" though as one respondent points out, the Christian view is theomorphism: that we are created in the image of God.  Given his contempt for orthodox Christianity, it is perhaps not surprising that Nielsen admits he knows little about the gospels or cosmology.  Why does he come to these things, anyway? <br /> <br />Philosophy for Craig is a contact sport, and he vigorously sorts arguments right and left (or right and wrong), as happy to contradict Moreland as Nielsen.  I am not sure he has always been so cheerful about being contradicted, but his arguments are forceful, knowledgeable, and to the point. <br /> <br />Overall, Anthony Flew seemed pretty good, honest and \\"present\\" as the Buddhists say. But a second weakness of this book is that the skeptics argued erroneously from comparative religion, and the Christians answered them only partially.  Flew accused Jesuits who identified the Chinese \\"Tian\\" with \\"God\\" of a \\"Jesuitical maneuver.\\"  In my opinion as a China scholar, Matteo Ricci, the primary Jesuit in question, was on the right track.  Many people who have studied Chinese culture in depth have agreed, including the great Kang Xi emperor, the scholar James Legge, and others. (See my True Son of Heaven: How Jesus Fulfills the Chinese Culture.) A case can be made from anthropology that people in most cultures around the world have in fact been aware of the Supreme God as understood by Christians. <br /> <br />Parson's argument about molecular evolution unfortunately goes unanswered; I think this is an interesting topic for debate.  His argument against the resurrectionseems to me like begging the question.  He complains that it is \\"more reasonable for an atheist to believe just about any alternative scenario, no matter how improbable.\\"  Whatever happened to proportioning belief to the evidence?  Parsons says, suppose Mother Theresa claimed she could fly by flapping her arms.  Obviously we would not believe such a report, so why believe the resurrection?  Such an example only shows he has not really come to grips with the nature of and evidence for the resurrection (see, in particular, N. T. Wright's The Resurrection of the Son of God), or of the Gospels.  I argue in my new book, Why the Jesus Seminar Can't find Jesus, and Grandma Marshall Could, that Gospel miracles are \\"realistic, purposeful, constructive, respectful, and pious.\\" The picture of Mother Theresa flapping her frail arms like a pigeon qualifies in none of these regards. Parsons is going to have to read the Gospels more fairly if he wants to persuade anyone that his explanation is the true one. <br /> <br />Flew assumes the Christian Creator \\"sees the production of human life as an or the main object\\" of creation.  So why bother with all those other galaxies?  But Christian intellectuals who have grown up on C. S. Lewis (most of us, maybe), have never claimed that God's only purpose in creating is human life.  Who knows what else he has in mind?  Flew replies in advance that the response \\"His ways are not our ways\\" is just a post hoc response.  On the contrary, admitting the limits to our knowledge has been part of Christian theology from ancient times, and is in general wise epistemology.  As Confucius said, \\"To know what you know, and know what you don't know, this is knowledge.\\" <br /> <br />I find the atheists represented here enjoyable to read, and highly knowledgeable in some areas.  It must be tough to be a professional philosopher: aside from logic, language and epistemology, you have to know a little bit about almost everything, it seems.  Here you get usefulbits of knowledge and thought from most all the contributors, though.  <br />	2005-03-15

Most anthologies of essays are like a loose pile of sand, but thematically, I thought this one hung together fairly well. The style varied from popular to almost bibliographical.       The Ayn Rand essays were informative, though I thought Smith bent over backwards a bit too far to shield Rand herself from the charge of fanaticism.  (As is so often done with Marx.) The essays I liked the best were \\"My Path to Atheism,\\" \\"Atheism and the Virtue of Reasonableness,\\" (good advice for theists as well), and \\"Frantz Fanon and John Locke at Stanford,\\" which I read as a stirring defense of free thought against the PC mind control so prevalent in our academic establishments.  If everyone (including Smith himself)would follow his rules for debate in that second essay, we might be in for a lot of good, healthy debate!      As a Christian, I was perturbed, but not surprised (having seen it so often), to find someone as apparently well-informed as Smith badly misunderstand what orthodox Christians mean by faith.  He repeated the old canard that \\"Faith conflicts with reason,\\" and a great deal of his discussion was saddled with this profound and oft-repudiated error.  Faith, he argued,   \\"cannot give you knowledge.\\"  It is \\"intellectually   dishonest, and should be rejected by every person of integrity.\\"  He backed up his mangled argument with the writings of some obscure theologian.  But when understood as orthodox Christians understand it (as I argue in my book Jesus and the Religions of Man), it is truer to say that nothing besides faith can give knowledge.  \\"Never, never doubt the efficacy of your mind,\\" Smith advised.  Yes, and that is (in the Christian sense) an act of faith.  Beyond a reasonable and tested faith in reason, memory, the fives senses, and other people, faith in God is the highest form not of blind faith (an un-Christian concept), but of the clear-headed act of reason by which rational beings perceive what is real in their environment.  If you think faith is a wild and uneccessary leap in the dark, you misunderstand the Christian religion, and the nature of knowledge in general.       Suffering from this misunderstanding, Smith blames Augustine for the Dark Ages; which I think is radically unfair.  (Especially considering that Augustine, one of the greatest thinkers in world history, died in a city under siege of the invaders who really did usher in the Dark Ages.)      Smith also tries halfheartedly to argue that Jesus fit the \\"profile\\" of an abusive cult leader.  This is nonsense.  In fact, compare the more detailed list of traits common to cult leaders compiled by such skeptical psychologists as Marcia Fabin and Anthony Storr with the Gospels, and it appears that Jesus was at the opposite end of the spectrum from that sort of person.  I have been studying world religion, gurus, Messiahs, and \\"Living Buddhas\\" for many years, and I have not found any who resembled Jesus.       Despite these criticisms, I enjoyed this book and found a lot of value in it.  Smith is extremely well-read, and writes with a style that is usually clear and  reasonable.  I look forward to reading his general defense of atheism.	2005-01-31

As novels go, this one is a bit like Grandma's Oldsmobile, that she takes out for church once a week, or a convertible with its top down on a bumpy road.  If you're in a hurry to get somewhere, it might drive you crazy.  If you're willing to enjoy some scenery along the way, this might be the vehicle for you.   <br /> <br />The focus of the story is less on one particular juror -- in fact, it is not even clear what the title has to do with anything in the plot -- as on ten years of a small southern town as seen through the eyes of the young man who buys the town newspaper.  The journalist, who narrates the story, tells his adventures with moonshine, desegregation, small town politics, the invasion of soul-snatching malls, a lunatic and a drunk or two, remodeling a house, learning how to eat southern, and, yes, a murder trial and revenge killings.  The hero here is a writer, not a lawyer -- does the change of roles mark the evolution of Grisham's consciousness?  Anyway, I just finished writing a book myself, and was therefore in a leisurely, Sunday afternoon mood, and enjoyed the slow and meandering drive through town.	2005-01-25
US	30581570	R16FXDTM6X658D	0060727640	711030092	2: The Collected Letters of C. S. Lewis, Volume II: Books, Broadcasts, and the War 1931-1949	Books	5	27	27	N	N	A rich mine of assorted treasures.	The second volume of letters from C.S. Lewis is more varied and consistently interesting than the first, I think.  For one thing, Lewis is writing to a wider group of people.  While in the first volume most letters are addressed to father, brother, or friend Arthur Reeves, now he is ensconced in Oxford, mildly famous and cursed with more correspondents than he wishes (though he is always polite, and usually thoughtful).  His father has passed away, his brother does some ghost-lettering, and Arthur still gets a few epistles.  But this volume also contains leaves to Dorothy Sayers (an excellent match), Owen Barfield, Charles Williams, John Betjeman, poet and painter Ruth Ritter, the Catholic student of Hinduism, Dom Bede Griffiths (whom he warns, \\"I now believe that refined, philosophical eastern Pantheism is far further from the true Faith than the semi barbarous pagan religions\\"), and a few short letters to T. S. Elliot, interesting for their terseness and studied politeness.  (Besides not liking his poetry, Lewis was mad at Elliot for not contributing to a book for the widow of Charles Williams.)  Possibly the most common topic of discussion is literature, much of it by one or the other correspondant.  But lots more gets touched on.        Some letters are also written to help people with spiritual questions, \\"plot good\\" of some sort, or pray with people like his Italian priest friend, with whom he corresponded in Latin.  (Given here in English and Latin.)  You can also find many interesting observations on a variety of topics sprinkled about.  (\\"Poetry I take to be the continual effort to bring language back to the actual.\\")      But the adjective that may best describe Lewis in many of these letters is \\"fun-loving.\\"  To Barfield: \\"Did I ever mention that Weston, Divine, Frost, Wither, Curry and Miss Hardcastle\\" (the villains in That Hideous Strength) were all portraits of you?\\"  To Sayers: \\"Mr. Bultitude (the lazy bear in the same book)is described by Tolkien asa portrait of the author, but I feel that is too high a compliment.\\"  I especially enjoyed the faux quarrel between Lewis, pretending to be the middleman for a medieval prince who seduced his king's wife (one letter goes out in Old English), and Barfield, representing himself as agent of the king, demanding reparation.  Lewis understood that a person makes a bad bargain in growing up if he forgets along the way how to play.      Lewis' letters to Laurence Harwood, his godson, mark a change of style: now he writes with Narnian simplicity, not \\"talking down\\" to children but talking about things both still find interesting. (And I did, too.)  \\"Yesterday the man who lives next door to us came into our garden when we weren't looking and cut down one of our trees . . . He is an old man with a white beard who eats nothing but raw vegetables.  He keeps goats who also have white beards and eat nothing but raw vegetables.  If I knew magic I should like to turn him into a goat himself; it wouldn't be so very wicked because he is so like a goat already!\\"      Much less interesting are the many \\"thank you\\" notes Lewis sends to Americans for \\"CARE\\" packages.  Some of these are repetitious; Lewis seems uncomfortable, experimenting with new ways of saying \\"thank you.\\"  Later some of these correspondences develop into something more interesting.  But since Hooper or Harper cut some, this would have been a good place to chop more more deeply.  The best stuff needs to be quarried a bit.  But like gemstones in a bedrock of fine granite, most of the other material is moderately interesting, though some is merely utilitarian.      Walter Hooper has done a phenomenal job with this series and this book in particular.  His notes are useful and often enlightening -- especially when he explains what Lewis' correspondent said, as he often does.  At the end of the book he gives graceful biographical sketches of about three dozen people who corresponded with Lewis.  (Very interesting people.) Hehas done a first-rate job with these first two volumes, and I'm looking forward to seeing the third.     author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2005-01-15

Strange, because the plot involves -- in this case -- unicorns that ride through time and space, devils, psychic mixing of personalities, and the possible end of the world.  Familiar, because the story is rooted in family, not the Simpsons or Archie Bunkers, but a loving home of scientists, artists, a tail-thumping black dog, (named Ananda -- not for the disfunctional Hindu sect of the same name) and a home that has its own, understated personality.  If you read her autobiographies -- she broke the rule by writing more than one -- it turns out that a lot of this comes out of her own rich life of love and relationships. (Her husband, like one of the characters here, ran a country store.)   <br />  <br />I liked this book.  I liked the way the hero touches down in different epochs at the same place, the \\"star-gazing rock\\" and the surrounding valley and forest.  We visit the place during the Ice Ages, early tribal periods, the colonial era, and earlier modern eras, following the story of a mixed and dangerously balanced family through time.  As it happens, the fortunes of that family will effect the future, or lack thereof, of planet earth, and it all depends (as in Ray Bradbury's story of the butterfly) on choices made in the distant past, that perhaps can be unmade.     <br />  <br />Admittedly, the book has a few weaknesses.  I think L'Engle exagerates how common witch hunting was in the American colonies, and mistakes how it was conducted.  (As far as I know, professional witch hunters were rare; most of it came from hysterical teenage girls.)  Also, making the villain with doomsday nukes a South American dictator seems a little odd -- where did any South American country come up with such a massive stockpile, presumably with all the missiles?  And the \\"good\\" family line versus the \\"bad\\" line is of course a very problematic theme.  <br />  <br />But L'Engle can be forgiven for letting her museget out of control occasionally.  Her descriptions of nature can be beautiful (\\"as each flaming sun turned on its axis, a singing came from the friction in the way a finger moved around the rim of a crystal goblet . . . and the song varies in pitch and tone from glass to glass\\"), her characters are likeable (it can't be easy to make a unicorn come to life), the story engages interesting ideas, and most of all, there is a purity or goodness here that makes me feel at home.	2004-11-27

Bishop in the West Wing has its charms, especially, I imagine, for Democrats right now.  The ghost sub-plot is amusing, and the story moves well.  The book compares favorably, say, to the Da Vinci Code, which it in some ways it resembles.  Both are essentially works of mild, entertaining paranoia.  Da Vinci unfairly makes the Catholic Church the working villain for most of the tale; Greeley directs his jabs at Republicans.  Greeley does better at getting his facts straighter, in general.  I was going to nail him on mistakes about China, but he didn't make many, apart from the unlikely premise of civil war.    <br /> <br />My first Greeley book, the Book of Love, set up expectations that this volume overturned, however.  For sure, Greeley's political subtext here -- wouldn't it be nice if red and blue got along? -- sounds great.  But if \\"love hopes all things,\\" how is it every Republican in this book turns out to be a fascist, dunderhead, or closet Democrat?  (Or some combination of the three?) How realistic is it to have the Wall Street Journal advocate assassinating a new president?  (For no evident reason.)  And yes, it is a bit much for Greeley to dedicate the book to President Clinton, when the plot involves an ideal president who is falsely accused of indiscretions of which he is wholly innocent, egged on by a pernicious, blackmailing \\"Christian Family Union.\\"  I wasn't in the States during most of the Clinton years, but this strikes me as obsequious.  To tell the truth, despite the recent political hysteria, a lot of the compliments Greeley paid his ideal president actually seem to me to apply to the guy we have now more than to Clinton.     <br /> <br />Nor does Greeley make it clear why he thinks we ought to find the president's two foul-mouthed daughters so charming.  In the old days, the Catholic Church demonstrated its lack of prudery by painting Sistine Chapels.  Now Greeley does the same by having dim-witted 13 year olds talk dirty.  I liked the old ways better.   <br /> <br />Overall, despite the cheap shots and manifest lack of understanding directed at conservatives, I found the story moderately enjoyable.   <br /> <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2004-11-20

Thomas Cahill is attempting something very difficult here.  He is trying to tell the story of the person about whom everyone else has already told the story.  He is trying to stand in the cataract of Jesus scholarship and grab out a few choice coins (not rocks), without getting drenched by a spray of technical verbiage.  He is trying to write a biography that is chatty and colloquial, but also based on clear reasoning and sound scholarship.  He is trying to write in a fair-minded manner about someone everyone either loves or claims to like in a deconstructionist manner that, finally, amounts to something resembling fear.  <br />I have read quite a few similar attempts by non-scholars, or by scholars on Sunday afternoons, to do something like this, and I feel this one comes off pretty well.  Probably the closest comparisons might be A. N. Wilson's skeptical Jesus, A Life (inferior), or Philip Yancey's mushy-evangelical The Jesus I Never Knew (not bad).   <br />As you can see from reviews below, Cahill manages to offend a lot of Christians and secularists.  Considering all the chances he is taking, both with style and substance, one might call that an accomplishment.  <br />My advice would be to read a chapter before deciding if this is your style, if possible.  I almost always found his arguments reasonable and informed, and I have read a lot of these books, on all sides.  For me, the fact that he has literary pizzazz, and is not afraid to make a joke, maybe even a pun, does not hurt.  This is not a book written by a robot.  Cahill treats the text with the respect of relating it to the world of our experience, even if he is sometimes a tad groanish in doing so.  Furthermore, while not a scholar, Cahill relies on a few fairly reasonable ones -- no, that does not include anyone in the Jesus Seminar, but unfornately, neither does it include N. T. Wright, in my view the best -- and he brings a fair amount of ecclectic background knowledge to the texts.  (I was shocked tofind him referring to the Chinese philosopher Yuan Zhiming, for example, who I thought was my secret.)<br />If some disrespectful comment here on John or another Gospel bothers you, try Craig Blomberg's Historical Reliability of the Gospels.  If you ae attracted to the subtitle, &quot;The World Before and After Jesus,&quot; but find too little about Jesus' impact on history, I might recommend Christianity on Trial, the fascinating works of Vishal Mangalwadi, or the relevent chapter of my own Jesus and the Religions of Man.  If you're offended by Cahill because he makes bad jokes, I can't help you there.  But I think he is ultimately serious about Jesus, and I'm with him there.  <br />David Marshall / christthetao@msn.com	2004-06-11

As a grad student in China studies, I once made the mistake of referring to Marx and Satan in the footnote of a paper for a very by-the-book scholar.  He circled the title in heavy red ink and wrote in the margin with even heavier sarcasm: \\"Might the book have a bias?\\"  <br />Richard Wurmbrand certainly did have a bias, though not the one the \\"one star\\" reviewers below accuse him of.  No, this is not \\"anti-Semitic drivel;\\" Wurmbrand was himself a Jew, persecuted by the fascists for his race, who loved his people.  No, he is not a \\"reactionary fanatic,\\" nor does this book represent \\"the scarier mindscapes of the Bible Belt.\\"  Wurmbrand is actually from Romania, which is I believe some distance from Texas, and you read his many fascinating books, you will find he was actually quite thoughtful.  But yes, he was biased against communism.  He spent many years in slave labor camps, was tortured, and saw friends die.  (A slave labor camp, I might point out, is rather a scarier place than a Southern Baptist church; tens of millions of people died in such places in the last century.)  <br />Despite the provocative title of this book, such experiences did not render Wurmbrand bitter or unhinged.  His argument here is not a vitriolic piece of ad hominem; rather it is a serious suggestion, backed up, it seems, by a fair amount of circumstantial evidence.  <br />It is commonly argued that Marx had nothing to do with the crimes of communism.  Even if Wurmbrand's central thesis does not convince you, the evidence he offers does at least show the spiritual or psychological continuity between Marx and the crimes committed in his name. <br />The book has its flaws, true.  The evidence Wurmbrand offers is not overpowering.  Wurmbrand sometimes takes phrases like \\"demonic fury\\" a little too seriously; I suspect it was often mere hyperboli.  Also, he is not critical enough with his sources.  Although he does not base anything on it, in one place he seems to accept the \\"Ritual Satanic Abuse\\" scam, for example.  Finally, the book is a bit gossipy.  <br />Still, Wurmbrand knows a great deal about communism.  He seems to have read very widely in primary sources, and provides strongly suggestive quotes to back up his thesis.  He shows caution at times, and is knowledgeable and thoughtful.  <br />A few months ago I came across a dissertation in my university library entitled \\"The Role of Atheism in the Marxist Tradition.\\"  The author of the dissertation, a journalist named David Aikman, wrote it under the guidance of Donald Treadgold, editor of the Slavic Review and a leading historian of the Soviet Union.  It was interesting to me to find that Aikman took Wurmbrand's thesis very seriously, and in his own study of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, had found additional evidence that seemed to point in the same general direction.  <br />What did Marx and his chief disciples really believe?  As Wurmbrand admits, Marx and Satan is not the final word on that question.  But I think this little book does point out a set of facts that more conventional history largely ignores, and that ought to be considered; and not only as an intellectual curiosity.  Wurmbrand was not an arm-chair critic, but a witness, survivor, philosopher, and passionate lover of God and man.  The facts he points out, and his observations on this subject, are worth considering, if not just for their own sake, for the sake of those who died.    <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2004-05-22

The reviews of this book below are pretty varied: intelligent readers complain that Stark is trying to use sociology to undermine religion, and to prop it up; that he is a &quot;self-styled agnostic,&quot; and that he doesn't back up his faith in God (if that's what you want, read my book, Jesus and the Religions of Man!); that he despises post-modernism but gives in to it, and even that he tries to prove a point that the reader agrees with!  <BR> <BR>You can't satisfy everyone.  <BR> <BR>Personally, I found this book enjoyable and thought-provoking, though I didn't agree with every point, either.  <br />Stark thinks for himself.  He presents the facts in fresh perspective, offers serious arguments, and lets the chips fall on both sides of the page.  You must be doing something interesting when you get criticized as an unbeliever by believers, and as a believer by unbelievers.  <BR> <BR>Stark's thesis is that belief in &quot;One True God&quot; has sociological effects different from belief in many gods or no gods.  Monotheism created the cultural solidarity of the Jews that allowed them to survive as a people.  (As long as they retained that faith.)  Christianity spread during the early centuries through the social networks of ordinary believers.  Professional missionaries, Stark argues, are not much use.  (This is a good book for missionaries, by the way.)  After the Roman empire became officially Christian, the effort to convert Europeans stalled; Stark doubts if the mass of Europeans ever did become orthodox Christians.  Given the nature of monotheism, he thinks conflict between Muslims and Christians was inevitable: &quot;It is precisely God as a conscious, responsive, good supreme being of infinite scope -- who prompts awareness of idolatry, false Gods, and heretical religions.&quot;  This argument seems somewhat in conflict with his claim that Medieval Europeans were not really that Christian.  But it could be argued that even a vague theism lent Europe the solidarity by which to resist Islam, that India for example lacked.  <BR> <BR>Stark argues that persecution of Jews by Christians and Muslims came during times of stress from &quot;significant (outside) threats.&quot;  I found this one of his most interesting, and convincing, arguments.  Given similar attacks on minorities in Asia, though, I think the phenomena might also be given a broader sociological explanation, such as Rene Girard's theory of scape-goating. It would be interesting to try to fit the two theories together, somehow.  Also, to what degree might the three Western monotheisms resemble one another simply because they have interacted, rather than because of their common believe in God?   <br />Stark also offers an intriguing explanation of the general tolerance of American society, which he thinks is stronger among believers than among secularists.   <br />In effect, Stark dares to challenge the great religious dogma of our day, that all religions are basically the same, whether equally good, bad, or useful.  (To paraphrase Gibbon.) Stark argues that, for better AND for worse, faiths are not equal.  While at some points, he may overlook sociological or psychological similarities that creep into every community of like-minded persons, I think he is right that different world views do make different worlds.  His argument may need to be both narrowed and expanded, at different points.  Theisms do share some qualities, but in other regards, Confucianism (which can also be a form of theism, BTW) may seem more like Christianity, and Islam more like Marxism or Mormonism.  Those characteristics, I might argue, have in part to do with the personalities and actions of their founders.  <br />While I might be inclined to tweak some of his theories a bit, Stark's books constitute a thought-provoking, open-minded starting point for considering how Judeo-Christian faith helped form the peculiar world that we inhabit.	2004-05-17

L'Engle told us what they were like, but didn't really show us, it seemed to me, so they remained undeveloped.  <br />The basic plot is interesting, though as developed it tends to morander and jump, meander and jump.  A young teenage boy, an orphan who lives with his old grandmother, is taken by a long-lost cousin on a voyage to Venezuala, where his ancestor lived with a mysterious tribe of healers, and his Indian lover.  L'Engle manages to combine the \\"noble savage\\" tradition with a bit of \\"capitalist exploitation,\\" without stereotyping too much on either side.  One of L'Engle's strengths is her interest in science and the ecology of village life.  The story goes at cruise-ship velocity at sea -- slowly, I mean -- and it would be helpful if the characters all wore name-cards, to keep them straight.  All the elements for a good story are present, but fail somehow through lack of vivifying detail. Still, L'Engle does tend to see things differently, and that makes the story fairly interesting.	2004-05-17

Stephen Mitchell begins by telling how he was conflicted, as a child, between the loving and harsh passages of the Gospels.  It was only after years of Zen practice that he finally \\"got it.\\"  He went back and \\"studied all the scholarship that seemed to me intelligent and open-minded.\\"  But it was only during a trip to Israel that things clicked for him, when he met a Bedouin in the Sinai desert who seemed to personify the \\"Abba\\" of timeless Middle Eastern tradition, \\"And a voice inside me said,' Aha!'\\" and he went home to write this book.<br /><br />I was wondering, at this point, which scholars would he rely on?  How would he define \\"intelligent\\" or \\"open-minded?\\"  What evidence would he offer for his conclusions?<br /><br />It turned out there were a few \\"facts\\" in the rest of the book, mostly wrong ones.  \\"Forty years is a long time  . . . (Some) stories and reports were made up much later, by disciples of disciples.\\"  (But how many of us could not rely on first-hand accounts by ourselves or close relatives to write about events of forty years ago?)  \\"All reputable scholars agree that the stories of Jesus' predictions were added by later disciples.\\"  (No, they do not.  But even if they did, the evidence does not support that claim.)  \\"The legend of the resurrection would have surprised Jesus.  He himself never taught about a resurrection from the dead, because he wasn't afraid of death.\\"  This book is for adolescents; but I have to wonder if even a child could read such a silly and presumptuous bit of mind-reading with a straight face.<br /><br />But then I had a thought.  Was I being had?  Could Mitchell be simply cashing in on interest in Jesus?<br /><br />What could be easier than writing a book like this?  Scan the Gospels.  Read a few (carefully selected) scholars who share your views.  Tell a story about yourself to warm up the audience.  Quote liberally and freely, so half the book is someone else's words.  Use short words to market it to the young and gullible.  Leave plenty of white space.  End in 150 pages with a few rambling notes, and -- heh, presto!  Insta-book.<br /><br />Maybe my suspicions are incorrect.  But in any case, this book is not much good.  If you're looking for a book about Jesus with a literary tint, and without too many technical details, try Thomas Cahill's Desire of the Everlasting Hills, instead.  If you absolutely need a book like that by a skeptic, then even A. N. Wilson, with all his flaws, is far better and more interesting than this.

Spencer asks some good questions here, and has read widely enough, and is bold and honest enough, to come up with fairly reasonable answers.  I've read many books on Islam, and found this one pretty good; I learned a fair amount from it.  <BR> <BR>If the key to thinking clearly is to figure out what questions to ask, Spencer gets us off to a good start, because he asks excellent questions.  The titles of his chapters summarize the ground he covers: &quot;Is Islam a religion of peace?&quot;  &quot;Does Islam respect human rights?&quot;  &quot;Does Islam respect women?&quot;  &quot;Is Islam compatible with liberal democracy?&quot;  &quot;Can Islam be secularized and made compatible with the Western pluralistic<BR>framework?&quot;  &quot;Can science and culture flourish under Islam?&quot;  &quot;The crusades: Christian and Muslim.&quot; &quot;Is Islam Tolerant of Non-Muslims?&quot;  and finally, &quot;Does the West really have nothing to fear from Islam?&quot;  <BR> <BR>The answers Spencer gives to all these questions, if I had to chose a single word, would be &quot;No.&quot;  But he is fairly nuanced about it, and admits repeatedly that Islamic history sometimes offers better examples, and that many Muslims are shooting for something better.  <BR> <BR>One weakness of Spencer's approach is that he seems to rely mostly on second-hand research, rather than deep personal familiarity with the culture of Islam.  Fortunately, he has read a lot on both sides, (including some of my favorite <BR>&quot;subversive&quot; writers, like Bat Y'eor and Paul Fregosi), and is generally well-informed.  <BR> <BR>Only, and here's a second major weakness, Spenser almost invariably compares Islam to Christianity.  I am a Christian myself, but since Islam has had long interaction with Hinduism, Judaism, animism, and now communism, in other words the &quot;borders of Islam are bloody&quot; (as Huntington put it) on other fronts as well, I wish he'd varied his examples a bit.  <BR> <BR>A finalweakness of this book is that the interaction between Islam and Christianity is so complex, and there are so many villains on both sides, (also some heros) that Spenser's argument for real religious difference between Islam and the West seems to weaken from attrition.  He explains that the teachings and personalities of Jesus and Mohammed are radically different (which they are, and it is nice to see someone be honest about the crimes of the latter).  Yet Spenser concedes (in effect) that Christians have often acted more like Mohameed than like Jesus.  This begs for a bit of social theory to complement the history and theology.  Could we not explain the problems in modern Islam in terms of civilizational stress (like Bernard Lewis), demographics (like Samuel Huntington) or &quot;scape-goating&quot; (following Rene Girard), as easily as by the religious differences between the two systems?  Didn't the Japanese, Chinese, and West act very much the same way when subjected to similar social pressures?  <BR> <BR>Actually, I think Spenser could have considered these rival theories and borrowed what is useful and true in each of them, and still take the real differences between Islam and Christianity into account.  He might have used Vishal Mangalwadi's arguments and others on the social influence of Biblical thinking.  Girard's idea of scapegoating could have been helpful here, too, explaining Mohammed, and those who justify him, and the scapegoating of Israel, pretty well.  I do think, ultimately, that the Muslim world is to a large extent controlled by Koranic orthodoxy.  It also seems to me that the West itself was also heavily influenced by Islamic jihad ideas during the Middle Ages.  Spenser needs more theory to unify the facts, rather than just saying, &quot;Here these Muslims did this, and there they did that.&quot;    <BR> <BR>Spencer seems an honest man, and wrestles with the Koran and Bible what I would call a fair manner, dealing with verses that contradict histheory as well as those that support it.  It is refreshing to see anyone eschew relativism, and take the differences in religions seriously.  While his analysis could be improved, Islam Unveiled is a good place to go for the right questions, and to begin finding some reasonable answers.  <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2004-04-17

The best and most persuasive parts of this book are (in good evangelical tradition) the &quot;personal testimony&quot; portions.  Barker's own story of how he spent nineteen years in various Christian denominations, as singer, preacher, and itinerate evangelist, certainly turns the tables on the typical Christian testimony.  He talked about how for five years, he tried to retain his faith in Christianity, but God didn't seem to hear or answer.  That touched me, and seemed real.  At times, he did manage to effectively challenge my faith, on an emotional level.<br />Another part of Losing Faith that flowed well was his &quot;low-down&quot; on pastors he knew.  As he says, &quot;They are not all Elmer Gantry;&quot; most were, like himself, sincerely mistaken, in his view.  Still, he begins to show a pretty heavy hand at this point: a few pastors are con men, and the rest, it seems, are all clowns.  Those of us who know intelligent, compassionate and humble ministers -- and I know many, and missionaries who are simply heroic -- may begin at this point to wonder either how broad Barker's experience was (and he says it was very broad), or how honest he is in reporting it.<br />When Barker verges onto verifiable issues, a knowledgeable believer may conclude, &quot;We need to improve Christian education, if only to improve the intellectual reach of our infidels.&quot;  I wouldn't call Barker's arguments &quot;straw men,&quot; only because people who hold to the views he attacks really can be found.  But he is often attacking a kind of American folk religion, rather than Christianity as it is held by knowledgeable adults.<br />Barker's letter from &quot;God&quot; to a &quot;theologian&quot; is a clever idea, and he pulls it off well rhetorically.  But I couldn't help remember (as I read it) the replies real Christian theologians, and philosophers, have given to these very same questions.  (Including some by C. S. Lewis, whom Barker weakly attempts to refute in this book, but obviously does not know or understand well.)  Barker's complaints are often not just wrong, but show a fundamental misunderstanding of Christian views on things -- he should read Lewis' explanation of worship in Reflections the Psalms and Weight of Glory, and begin his argument against it from square one. (If possible.)<br />Another major problem with this book is Barker's misunderstanding of &quot;faith.&quot;  Christian faith, in the orthodox (as opposed to folk) understanding, has nothing to do with believing what you know isn't true, or forcing yourself to believe ten impossible things before breakfast.  I think Lewis actually corrects this error in Mere Christianity, as have numerous other Christian thinkers.  Barker ought to read more attentively.<br />This error gets him into trouble in his reply to &quot;Pascal's Wager.&quot; I think his reply to Pascal's argument (which I never much cared for) is actually pretty interesting, otherwise. (Though see Peter Kreeft's expanded version of that argument.)  But Barker betrays the fact that he probably has not actually read Pascal for himself, when he assumes that the Wager was his only or primary argument for Christianity.<br />Most of the rest of Barker's arguments will be familiar to most educated Christians, and replies will likely spring to mind.  Barker tries to automatically rule miracles out with his definition of history. (&quot;A criterion of critical history is the assumption of natural regularity over time.  This precludes miracles.&quot;)  This is, of course, simple dogmatism.<br />&quot;Christianity is harmful.  More people have been killed in the name of a god than for any other reason.  The Church has a shameful, bloody history . . . &quot;  Barker's understanding of history is highly questionable, but an even greater problem is that he seems as credulous in accepting the &quot;authorized&quot; skeptical version of history (ignorant, it seems, of the enormous positive accomplishments of Christian faith) as he once credulously his parents' Christianity.<br />His arguments against the historical Jesus, the resurrection, and so on, are simply lame.<br />All in all, despite its weaknesses, I found this book interesting, readable, and sobering.  While a bit egotistical (Barker loves to highlight his own witty replies to Christian challenges), on a personal level I found him often likeable.  He has trod a well-beaten path, from what M Scott Peck describes as the first three stages of spirituality.  I hope he is as honest and open-minded as he claims.  While he rejects a childish and unexamined form of Christianity, it seems clear to me that he has yet to honestly perceive, let alone consider, the Christian faith as it is understood by mature and knowledgeable adults.  Perhaps he will move beyond the adolescent reaction represented in this book, and learn to be skeptical about skepticism, as well.

What are the Gospels?  Biography?  Myth?  A unique genre of literature, otherwise unknown to the ancient world?  <BR> <BR>Richard Burridge begins by discusses genre, how it develops and evolves.  He offers a dozen or so characteristics by which we can judge the genre of a book.  No one item by itself proves that a given book belongs to a certain genre, he argues.  <BR> <BR>Following a few longish sections that establish his methods of analysis, Burridge introduces ten works that belong to the category of Graeco-Roman bioi, five from before the time of Christ, five from shortly after.  Applying the criteria he mentions earlier to these works, he establishes what an ancient biography was really like.  Then he considers the Synoptic Gospels, concluding that they clearly fit into this category. Next he performs the same operation with the Gospel of John, and concludes that it is also an example of ancient biography.  <BR> <BR>I think Burridge proves his case, that the canonical Gospels do belong to the category of ancient bioi, or biography.  (Be prepared for a few words of Greek in the text.)  But what does that mean to call the Gospels &quot;biography?&quot;  Among the examples of Bioi he considers are Tacitus' Agricola, a sober account of a Roman general written by his son in law a few years after his death, and Apollonius of Tyana, a tall tale loosely based on a New Age guru that talks about various breeds of dragon in India, and was written more than a hundred years after the alleged life it portrays.  So the simple fact that a work belongs to the category of bioi, does not prove that it is true.  <BR> <BR>Burridge notes however that Apollonius is rather on the fringe of the genre.  In some ways, the Gospels are closer to Agricola.  Having closely compared these two texts with the Gospels on my own, I came to the conclusion that in terms of historical reliability, the Gospels are closer to Agricola, and hardly resemble Apollonius of Tyana at all.  In fact,in some ways the Gospels seem more historical than Agricola.  <br />But Burridge does not discuss the historicity of the books he reviews directly.  Instead, he conducts a somewhat plodding, but careful, convincing, and I think useful argument that helps one better understand literary genre, ancient literature, the Gospels, and how they all fit together.	2004-04-09

Robert Funk is a knowledgeable fellow, and some of his points about aphorisms, translation, early texts, and parables are pretty good.  I wouldn't give Funk the lowest rating just because I disagree with him; I have reviewed Crossan and Borg more positively.   But honestly, I couldn't appraise this book any higher.  <br />For one thing, about half the book is an ill-tempered rant against Christians, Funk's students, and his colleagues.  Some is positively maudlin.  &quot;I agonize over their slavery as opposed to my freedom.  I have a residual hankering to free my fellow human beings from that bondage (of orthodox Christian belief), which can be as abusive as any form of slavery . . . &quot; (Of Raymond Brown and John Meier!) &quot;In their hands, orthodoxy is safe, but critical scholarship is at risk.  Faith seems to make them immune from the facts.&quot;  &quot;I found myself playing the role of an academic John the Baptist.&quot;  <br />Funk reminds me a bit of Karl Marx.  He has lost his faith, but retains a Messiah complex.  He has nothing good to say about anyone -- his former students, Christians, fellow academics -- who deigns to disagree with him.  He sees himself as a revolutionary.  &quot;Throw off your faith in a God who answers prayer, in a Christ who conquered death!  You have nothing to lose but your chains!&quot;  But Marx could at least be poetic.  Funk's weaknesses as a writer and a scholar make his exalted view of his role in history hard for me to take seriously.  <br />The scholarly weaknesses are many.  <BR> <BR>For one thing, there is that talk about the &quot;evolution&quot; of the &quot;sayings tradition.&quot;  By 70 AD, young disciples of Jesus (and mostly would have been young) would only be 50 or 60 years old.  What was to stop them from giving direct imput? Why must we assume that only second or third hand reports were available by that time?   <BR> <BR>Also, like all the Jesus Seminar material, Honest to Jesus bases its argument on taking the &quot;Gospel&quot; of Thomas seriously.  I find I can't do that.  Perhaps it would help if Funk answered the powerful arguments against Thomas levied by Meier, Wright, Sanders, and other top-notch scholars.  But he opts out, evidently preferring ad hominem attacks to rational debate.  <BR> <BR>Funk does better on parables and aphorisms.  Surely, as he says, it is highly unlikely that any early scribe invented the peculiar and remarkable sayings of Jesus.  It does not however follow, as Funk assumes, that any &quot;conventional morality&quot; in the Gospels must be a transplant, because Jesus must be unpredictable.  A person who only offers exotic teaching is a smart-aleck or a sophist, not a true sage.  Great literary critics, like Chesterton, Lin Yutang, or even Thomas Cahill, recognize in the Gospels a higher synthesis of obvious and subtle truths, rather than playing those levels of truth off against one another as Funk does. <BR> <BR>&quot;Physician, heal thyself.&quot;  Here's another problem.  Funk praises metaphor, but speaks almost exclusively in cliches.  He commends kindness, but then savagely attacks everyone arounnd him.  He derides dogmatism, but is himself remarkably dogmatic. <BR> <BR>The basic message of this book can almost be summed up thus: &quot;Jesus taught wonderful things, but his disciples misunderstood him completely.  Fortunately, a crack team of scholarly experts, led by yours truly, has advanced in scientific understanding far beyond their hapless peers, to say nothing of the disciples or ordinary pew proles.  We few experts are able to see through Christian lies about Jesus to the truth: Jesus not only rode donkeys, he also voted for them.  Repent and be saved.&quot; <BR> <BR>Politics aside (as far as possible, please), why should we care what Funk's deconstructed, human Jesus would want, or &quot;demand?&quot; He does not explain.  <br />And in the end, Funk offers no very strong historical argument for his skepticism, but a lame philosophical prejudice.  &quot;In the wake of the Enlightenment . . . we presumably know better.&quot;  As he put it in another book, how can people who have &quot;seen the heavens through Galileo's telescope&quot; believe in miracles?  <br />Skeptics are going to have to do better than that.  <BR> <BR>I just read books by NT Wright and Rodney Stark on related topics.  That's how to do scholarship!  They set their ideas out in clear, dispassionate, and sometimes witty phrases, without undue polemic, fairly explaining opposing positions and why they chose to differ.  Crossan and Borg can also be read with pleasure, and a measure of respect.  But as with Marx, the combination of flaky theories, self-righteous self-promotion, shrill invective, and stitled prose that I found here, made reading this book a painful chore. <BR> <BR>author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2004-04-06

I found many worthwhile insights in this book: the way he links the Gospels and Paul's teaching on grace (though Jesus and Paul also call us to radical moral purity, and Borg sometimes makes meaning slave to etymology), his discussion of meta-narratives, parables, and aphorisms, and the contrast between &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; and &quot;unconventional&quot; wisdom, for example. <br />But the criteria by which Borg judges whether or not a given teaching really is from Jesus are shaky.  Does the &quot;Gospel&quot; of Thomas have anything of value to say about the life of Jesus?  I doubt it.  Why does Borg assume that only material from the Christian &quot;tradition&quot; before 60 A.D. can be trusted?  If I were to write about the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, at a chronological distance equivalent to 93 AD, I could easily find eyewitnesses.  Why should it have been so much harder for the Gospel writers in 70 AD?  <br />Borg's chief weakness may be his habit of working alternatives into what look like false dichotomies, or trichotomies: holiness versus compassion, individual versus political virtue, &quot;belief&quot; versus &quot;action&quot; versus &quot;becoming.&quot;  (Why not all three?  &quot;Love God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength!&quot;)  Borg's method of exegesis is often to exagerrate one element in Jesus' teaching, then make that a principle by which to exclude other elements.    <br />Borg identifies JS pronouncements with the &quot;scholarly consensus.&quot;  But many first rank scholars (Wright, Hays, Johnson, Meier, Jenkins, and others) find the JS way of working quite flawed.  <br />Borg writes of &quot;pre-critical&quot; and &quot;post-critical&quot; naivitee; but he shows a great deal of what might be called &quot;unidirectional&quot; naivitee.  He explains how, as a young man, he discovered Biblical criticism and lost his faith.  He later recovered a faith, which, like John Blofeld's faith in the bodhissatva Guan Yin, seemed to have &quot;nothing to do with belief.&quot;  The problem is, while he learned to treat the Gospels critically, his seminary professors did not seem to teach him to treat their own ideas the same way.  Thus, he makes little mention of another kind of Christian that might be called the &quot;post-critical believer&quot; -- the Christian who has read Borg, Crossan, Pagels, Mack, and more radical critics, and come to the conclusion that their methods and conclusions are badly mistaken -- not on theological, but on historical grounds.  <br />We post-critical believers can only feel marginalized and a bit ghostly, not finding ourselves among Borg's typology of believers.  <br />Borg also attempts to tie the radical compassion of Jesus to his alleged identity as a &quot;spirit person&quot; who experienced mystical unity with God: &quot;There is an intrinsic connection between the boundary-shattering experience of Spirit and the boundary-shattering ethics of compassion.&quot;<br />As a student of world religions, I think not.  &quot;All we shamans know that the spirits are happiest when we kill people,&quot; one Yamonamo Indian is quoted as saying; and certainly the most active spiritism can coexist with the most brutal denigration of women.  East Indian advedic gurus and tantric Buddhists often rigidly oppress their followers, and a rich heritage of mystical science did not prevent India fromo sinking into a sinkhole of caste and gender oppression.  In fact, the true source of reform and breaking down of social boundaries has far more often come from a strict monotheism -- among the Jewish prophets, Chinese sages like Confucius, the anti-slave movements in the Middle Ages and the Modern West, and even in India and Japan.  <br />In the end, as Dr. Borg shares his own story, he seems rather lost to me, following a &quot;Jesus&quot; who is a worthy enough sage, but incapable of inspiring the joyous songs he recalls with tears from his childhood.  I feel for him.  I think he is quite mistaken about the Gospels.  The more I study world religions, the more I am persuaded that Jesus is the Lord of life, who died for the sins of the world, and rose from the dead.  I think an honest assessment of the evidence leaves that as the most realistic assessment.  I am tempted to echo Dr. Borg's own words, and say, &quot;Dr. Borg, come home, and meet Jesus again, for the first time.&quot;     <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man / christthetao@msn.com	2004-02-25

Wright doing, refuting the likes of Spong and Thiering?  Does one need a bulldozer to squash ants?  (Wilson, I personally find more intelligent, and thus perhaps rising to the dignity of being run over.)  Yet Wright gives their arguments a fair hearing, then a fair and gentle hanging.  <BR> <BR>But there seems to be method to Wright's mildness.  As an alternative to the fumbling and bumbling of his protagonists, he offers a simple and readable description of who he has found the historical Jesus to be.  Their errors prove a useful foil for explaining the methods and conclusions of legitimate New Testament scholarship.  Wright's critiques of those with whom he disagrees are always a delight -- he shows a sincere appreciation for what is worthwhile, then refutes errors with wit and the gentle precision that comes of great intellectual power matched to thorough knowledge of the subject.  <BR> <BR>The subject here is Jesus, a fox in pursuit of whom academic hounds have banged their heads on many trees.  Wright rightly follows him to the cross.  &quot;The Christian doctrine is all about a different kind of God -- a God who was so different to normal expectations that he could, completely appropriately, become human . . . To say that Jesus is in some sense God is of course to make a startling statement about Jesus.  It is also to make a stupendous claim about God.&quot;   <BR> <BR>I think Wright over-emphasizes the genius of Biblical scholarship.  He tends to give the impression that nobody knew anything worth knowing about Jesus, until the question was brought to the attention of modern academics.  Having read many &quot;Jesus Seminar&quot; books, I think credentialed scholars like Crossan, Borg, Mack, and Pagels, are often as foolish as Wilson -- and less truly knowledgeable about the historical Jesus than the average Pentacostal grandmother.  <br />Wright also knocks C. S. Lewisfor his &quot;odd&quot; criticism of the &quot;quest for Jesus&quot; as &quot;the work of the devil,&quot; in the Screwtape Letters.  Aside from the unfairness of ignoring the humor in a satire, I think the substance of Lewis' arguments, made more seriously in Fernseed and Elephants, is entirely sound, and makes an excellent critique of many recent historical Jesus reconstructions.  I think Wright's historical reconstruction, and Lewis' literary critique of shoddy skeptical arguments, complement one another nicely.<br />In sum, I recommend this book both for people who have been bamboozled by the particular works it refutes, and also as an antidote to recent works of a similar nature, like the Da Vinci Code, Jesus Mysteries, The Jesus Puzzle, or perhaps Elaine Pagel's new book, Beyond Belief.  I am working on a book that will combine Wright and Lewis' approaches, to answer recent attacks on the Gospels.     <BR> <BR>author, Jesus and the Religions of Man / <br />christthetao@msn.com	2004-02-23

Review:  Popcorn poppycock<br />The premise of Da Vinci Code shows promise: grisley murders, a secret set to shake the foundations of Christendom, and a series of (sometimes too easy) puzzles -- a &quot;Whereisit&quot; grafted onto a &quot;Whodonit&quot; connected to a &quot;Whatreallyhappened.&quot;  While Brown has no stylistic or descriptive talent whatsoever (you'd never want to read this book twice, that's the test), he did keep the juices flowing for me one time through.  (So long as I pushed the &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; meter up to its highest setting.)<br /><br />The book's many inanities and historical blunders are hard to overlook, however.  Brown doesn't know (what one embarrassed pagan historian pointed out) that fear of witches was a traditional part of European paganism, that this fear was squelched by the Church during the &quot;Dark Ages&quot; and then revived during the Renaissance; that tens of thousands, not &quot;five million&quot; witches were killed; or that these crimes occurred mostly in small towns on the margins of State and Church power, not in the shadow of the Vatican.  Ironically, Brown himself exploits the psychological mechanism that launches witch hunts in his choice of villains.  I myself am neither Catholic, albino, nor physically handicapped; but I find Brown's inability to rise above such pernicious type-casting unfortunate.  And his attempt to get inside the minds of his characters is marvelously shallow.  One half expects them to jump out of the book and cry, &quot;Hang on!  If I were this stupid, how did I get to be a Harvard professor / Catholic bishop / successful criminal?&quot;<br />As for Brown's chatter about early Christian history, lost Gospels, Church conspiracies, and the cover-up of Jesus' marriage to Mary Magdelene, which he and some rather breathless reviewers manage to take seriously, I admit I found his historical blundering mildly entertaining.

Hidden Gospels is like a bowl of split pea soup: nourishing, filling, but not what you would order at a fancy French restaurant.  This bowl of history soup is just the cure if you have bought into radical Jesus theories.  With caution, balance, fine judgement, and scholarly courtesy, (qualities often missing from works of the Jesus Seminar, still less the even more fringe stuff) Jenkins writes an excellent general survey of modern errors in the &quot;search for Jesus.&quot;  He concludes (rightly, I think) that the Gnostic and other &quot;new gospels&quot; have little if anything to say about Jesus, and that they are inferior to the canonical Gospels, both as historical sources and in terms of social merit.  (Actually I think he goes too easy on Thomas, but that is another story.)  <BR> <BR>Probably the greatest contribution of this book is its discussion of the radical Jesus theories as modern myth, and the social forces that create that myth.  He discusses not only scholars, such as Crossan, Funk, Mack, Pagels, and King, but also how their ideas &quot;filter down&quot; to the masses through junk novels, television, and movies.  (A pity he didn't write this book after The Da Vinci Code and Pagel's new Thomas book; though it is always interesting to see people blunder into a trap publicly laid and waiting.)  <br />Jenkins argues that the Gospels are superior to the Gnostics in terms of historical believability and social value.  It is indeed ironic that the very people who blame Christianity for being mysogenist, distrustful of the body, and hierarchical, prefer Gnostic writings that (he suggests, and I also suspect) were probably the source of these qualities in later Christianity.  <BR> <BR>Elaine Pagel's best-selling new book, Beyond Belief, could almost have been written to illustrate Jenkins points.  Jenkins reads hundreds of scholars with whom he disagrees, and carefully, politely points out their errors.  Pagels, by contrast, could not be troubled to name a single scholar who dissents from her views, even such respected and careful historians as John Meier, N.T. Wright, or Jenkins himself.  Nor do the Jesus Seminar' popular &quot;Five Gospels&quot; or &quot;Complete Gospels&quot; answer their critics.  Radical biblical &quot;scholarship&quot; seems to be a hothouse phenomena, flourishing in a highly protected environment.  Hidden Gospels is in part an explanation of this odd phenomena.  <BR> <BR>The main defects of this book have to do with Jenkin's methodological conservatism.  The book is sometimes repetitive, the style sometimes ponderous.  His refutations of Crossan and company are not as witty and fun as, say, N.T. Wright.  Also, while Jenkins is wise to appeal to &quot;consensus scholarly views,&quot; I wish he would have discussed the Gospels and Gnostic writings directly more than he does.  (A fault he shares with Pagels.)  Personally, I think the best argument for the Gospels, and against the Gnostics, is the works themselves.  I can't see how anyone who has read both sets of documents can confuse them.  <br />Hidden Gospels, despite its styllistic flaws, is a vitally important and high-quality historical study.  I hope future skeptical historians, and their publishers, will carefully consider the points Jenkins makes before throwing intellectual cotton candy like &quot;Hidden Gospel of Thomas&quot; or &quot;Complete Gospel&quot; at us, 99%air.

Martin Palmer has packed three or four interesting books into one moderately-sized volume.  First, there is the Indiana Jones-like story of how he discovered the oldest church in China, a Nestorian site that dates to the 7th Century and was apparently a center of the earliest Chinese Christianity.  (X marks the spot.)  Second, he and his colleagues give translations of a series of early Chinese Nestorian writings, from the famous Nestorian stele (8th Century) to later, more syncretistic works.  Third, there is Palmer's reconstruction of the history of what he calls &quot;Taoist Christianity.&quot;  And finally, there are his own, always enthusiastic and interesting, but sometimes debatable, views on East, West, and how the twain might meet.<br />I found the combination a great deal of fun.  Palmer's good cheer is infectious and understandable: he has done a clever and romantic piece of detective work.  The translated Scriptures contain many striking images, and I am thrilled, as a student of the interaction between the West and China, to have these resources together, and translated into pithy English.  (Though I wish he'd included the Chinese as well.)  The book is, furthermore, physically lovely.  <br />Palmer's analysis of the Nestorian church and its relation to Western Christianity is probably the weakest link in the book.  He has a bit of a grudge against Western Christianity.  He improbably ascribes much of what he finds attractive among Chinese Nestorianism to influence from Jainism, of all things, though the same qualities can be found in early Western Christianity.  He seems to imagine the Nestorians as ecologists based on a shaky interpretation of a single Chinese character (zhen), and supposes them free of the original sin of believing in original sin, based on equally scanty evidence.  (Even while one modern Chinese philosopher writes enviously of how that concept helped create Western freedom.)  Nor does he notice that in one respect, the Nestorians fell far short of Western Christian tradition: they seem to have preferred buttering up emperors to rebuking them -- no Ambrose, Solzhenitsyn, or Wang Mingdao here.  (The doctrine of karma didn't seem to help, as these texts show: the poor are poor because of past crimes, the emperor is powerful because of past virtue.)<br />Two other points may be worth mentioning.  First, there is an important difference between the approach Jing Jing, the author of the Nestorian stele, took in the 8th Century, and the later &quot;Jesus Sutras&quot; translated in earlier chapters.  The first is in my opinion an orthodox attempt to contextualize Christian thought in Asian terms, like what Matteo Ricci would do later, except that while Ricci identified with Confucianists, Jing Jing related Christianity to Buddhist and Taoist thought, or at least images.  Some later sutras, by contrast, are a mish-mash of images and beliefs from the various traditions.  Palmer seems to prefer the latter; I prefer the former.  <br />Second, the word &quot;Tao&quot; needs some explanation.  Palmer is right to call the Chinese Nestorians &quot;Taoist Christians.&quot; But really, all Chinese Christians are &quot;Taoist.&quot;  This for the simple reason that &quot;Tao&quot; means &quot;the Way,&quot; and philosophically, something pretty close to &quot;Logos.&quot;  The term does not belong to Taoists -- every school of Chinese thinkers use it, beginning with Confucius.  And so the Bible reads in Chinese, &quot;In the beginning was the Tao, and the Tao was with God, and the Tao was God&quot; -- referring to Jesus.  Furthermore, many Chinese Christian thinkers -- Lin Yutang, John Wu, Yuan Zhimin -- have felt the teachings of Lao Zi were in fact a pretty good introduction to Jesus.  I think so, too. <br />author, True Son of Heaven: How Jesus Fulfills the Chinese Culture	2004-01-19

To a Different Drum is the autobiography of Pauline Hamilton, a short-legged, slightly iconoclastic East Coast scientist who became a missionary to China, where she had a lot of adventures.  Actually, she began the adventures in America.  After failing in love, health, and studies, she decided to kill herself by driving her sister's car off a country road in the Appalachians, but was prevented at the last moment by an odd &quot;accident&quot; that she attributed to divine intervention.  In China, and then later in Taiwan, many other such fortuitous <BR>&quot;accidents&quot; occurred, many amazing, some quite funny.  <br />In one lovely scene, Pauline's housekeeper, whom she suspects of having stolen all her money, grumbles about being made to set the table for breakfast even though there is no food to put on it.  Just then, a neighbor knocks on the door with homemade bread (mantou).  A moment later, another neighbor comes by with 20 eggs.  (&quot;I laid them myself!&quot;  &quot;Rather special, I'd say.&quot;)  The housekeeper continues to grumble that they lack fruit or coffee.  A boy rides up on a biscycle with a beautiful golden papaya, and a friend from another part of town comes by with a jar of coffee, which her airline employee husband brought from another country -- all in time for breakfast.  Pauline tells this and other stories with a good sense of comic humor and drama.  <br />One reason I like this book is because it reminds me of many of my own experiences in China and Taiwan.  I can almost taste the fresh papaya!  The details she gives about Chinese life, and the interesting personalities she described, ring true to me.  (I also know a few of the minor characters.)  I have also had some very similar experiences with divine provision when I was out of everything, and had nowhere to turn, which were also rather funny.  Of course, Pauline had hard times as well, which may be more important to the point of the book as a whole.  The ultimate point of her book, and one may say her life, is &quot;Trust God&quot;   She found many good reasons to do so.	2003-12-27

Yet I get the impression, from Krakauer's earlier book, Into Thin Air, that he would not advise me to climb Mount Everest, and from Into the Wild, that he might warn me against living off the land in Alaska.  <BR> <BR>Krakauer is reasonably fit, intellectually.  He's passionate, curious, and a great story-teller.  He has studied early Mormonism, and the fanatics whose murders he chronicles, quite well, despite complaints by mainstream Mormons below.  (What else can they say?  &quot;Official&quot; Mormonism is a strange hybrid: the classic 19th Century blend of guns, girls, gods, and snake oil, evolving in the direction of orthodoxy, but required by corporate necessity to deny both the pagan nature of the original, and the radical nature of changes required.) <BR> <BR>The story is bloodcurdling and somber, and fits with Krakauer's other books well.  Why do people do crazy things?  What weakness besets mortal man, betraying us to unnatural risks and unnecessary deaths?  Are we mad, or is it the logic of the human situation that drives us to it?  There's a bit of Shakespeare in Krakauer.  The fact that the stories he tells are true-life, makes it all the more interesting.  <BR> <BR>But religion is even more complex and dangerous than ice falls or grizzly bears.   Krakauer tries fitfully to parlay his knowledge of Mormonism into an assault on the summit of larger religions, about which he demonstrates little knowledge.  To assume that all religions are like the one you happen to study, is the ultimate Weekend Warrior fallacy: &quot;Climb one mountain, and you've climbed them all.&quot; <BR> <BR>My view is that study of &quot;fundamentalist&quot; Mormonism does shed light on &quot;revolutionary religions&quot;: &quot;classical&quot; Mormonism, Islam, Marxism, Peoples' Temple.  It is of less value in trying to understand Advetic or Buddhist thinking, (though there are similar cults in Asia) and only confuses the issue in dealing with Confucianism or Christianity. <BR> <BR>When Krakauer yields to the impulse to generalize, he often gets it badly wrong.  He assumes that religious faith is by definition blind, unrelated to evidence.  But most religions in fact offer evidence, good or bad, for their claims.  Christian thinkers, including first-rate scholars, never tire of explaining that reason supports faith.  Krakauer has obviously never come across any of those explanations, or the evidence given to back it up.    <BR> <BR>&quot;There are some ten thousand extant religious sects -- each with its own cosmology, each with its own answer for the meaning of life and death.  Most assert that the other 9,999 not only have it completely wrong, but are instruments of evil, besides.&quot;  <BR> <BR>This is theology with a butcher's knife.   In fact, most religions do NOT claim all the others are &quot;completely wrong.&quot;  Buddhists agree with Hindus about reincarnation and karma.  Islam affirms Jesus as a prophet.  Christianity accepts the Jewish Bible, and affirms Muslim faith in God, Taoist faith in the power of the weak, Confucian love of kindness and loyalty, and much that is valuable in Hinduism and Buddhism -- as great Christian thinkers have never tired of pointing out.  Actually, it is atheism that assumes all religions are mainly wrong about all the most important facts.  <BR> <BR>&quot;The impetus for most fundamentalist movements . . . is a yearning to return to the mythical order and perfection of the original church.&quot;  <BR> <BR>Perhaps.  But doesn't it matter if the &quot;original church&quot; was founded by a polygamist who conquered the Arabian peninsula with the sword, a treasure-hunting con man, a monk who withdraws from society, or a person who healed the sick, forgave his enemies, and died for his disciples?  Joseph Smith was a scoundrel; that doesn't mean Confucius, Buddha, or St. John were.  Defining fundamentalism as &quot;return to the original&quot; does not join,it divides, religions, because the originals differ.<BR> <BR>It is vital in our day to try to understand religions both respectfully and honesty.  I think Krakauer tries to do this, in regard to Joseph Smith and latter-day imitators.  He does not, however, squarely face the vast, uber-alpine chasms and icefalls that separate the specificities of human religions.  Understandably, perhaps, since to question the convention that all religions are basically the same has become the ultimate heresy.  But isn't that all the more recent to go after it?  Krakauer climbs a minor peak in the Utah Rockies, and gets a touch of altitude sickness.  If he wants to challenge the truly Himalayan fallacies of our day, he should chuck the relativistic cliches and other a priori dogmas like so many bags of twinkies, and go into serious intellectual training. <BR> <BR>Still, within these limitations, this dramatic, passionate, and tragic tale fascinates, teaches me a lot about Mormonism, and, like Krakauer's other books, gave me a great deal of food for thought.   <BR> <br />christthetao@msn.com	2003-11-11

Elaine Pagels is a delightful writer, and one of the more reasonable of the skeptical Bible scholars I have read.  Call the latter &quot;damning with faint praise,&quot; however.  <br />Here, Pagels compares the Gospel of John, emphasizing faith in Jesus, to the &quot;Gospel&quot; of Thomas, that stresses realizing truth within oneself.  She argues John was written to refute Thomas.  She reconstructs how and why the former became &quot;orthodox&quot; <BR>Christianity, and the latter, banned and forsaken of all but Zen Buddhists.  Emphasizing differences between John and the Synoptic Gospels, she traces the rise of &quot;orthodoxy&quot; through Polycarp to Iraneaus and Tertullian, who made Christianity the dogma friendly religion it remained.  <br />I found much of Pagel's creation myth interesting, and her tone personable.  (She is willing to admit good qualities in the dogmatism she opposes, for example.)  But she does two things that make it hard for me to take the first part of her story seriously.  First, she places John in a faith ghetto, apart not only from the other Gospels, but also the works of Paul, etc.  I think that he agrees with the other writers of the New Testament on practically everything.  Secondly, she makes the &quot;Gospel&quot; of Thomas the cornerstone of her thesis.  This is a wobbly and insecure foundation, however.  <br />The idea that John was written to disprove Thomas is untenable for at least three reasons.  First, (as Pagels herself admits here), John shows many marks of familiarity with the time, events, and persons of First Century Palestine, while Thomas (as I think she admits of the Gnostics in general, in the Gnostic Gospels) shows none.  It was therefore entirely reasonable for early Christians to accept the obviously historical John and reject the even more obviousy unhistorical Thomas: where is the mystery?  <br />Secondly, many Biblical scholars believe, for what seem excellent reasons, that Thomas was written in the Second Century.  Oxford scholar Tom Wright suggests that Thomas is not only unhistorical, it is even anti-historical: &quot;Thomas did for the parables in the second century what Julicher, Dodd and Jeremias did in the twentieth, and perhaps for similar reasons, namely, the attempt to get away from their historical and very Jewish specificity.&quot;  Pagels never mentions discouraging words like this from competing scholars, still less refutes any of the evidence on which they are based.  We are supposed to accept her early dating for Thomas on blind faith, it seems.  I wish she had been inspired by the Thomas who was full of doubts, rather than the Thomas who is simply doubtful.  <br />Thirdly, John resembles the Synoptic Gospels much, while Thomas resembles them little.  I recently went over what the Jesus Seminar calls the &quot;Five Gospels&quot; with a fine-toothed comb, and narrowed it down to four again.  First, I listed 45 characteristics of the Synoptic Gospels, 43 of which John strongly shares.  I then compared Thomas and other ancient literature, and found that of six documents I compared with the canonical Gospels, Thomas resembled them the LEAST.  (And two of the other documents were from China!)  I found Thomas flagrantly a-historical, formulaic, lacking in developed, convincing characters, unconnected to space or time, un-Jewish, and platitudinous on occasion.  Pagels claims that John, unlike the Synoptics, has no moral teaching.  Actually John contains rich moral teaching of the highest caliber: it is Thomas (surprisingly, for a sayings &quot;Gospel&quot;) that has none!  <br />In short, I find NO reason to take the &quot;Gospel of Thomas&quot; seriously as a source for the life of Jesus, or to call it a Gospel.  John, on the other hand, is intimately related to the Synoptic Gospels in dozens of vital ways, and shows many signs of being a trustworthy account of something that happened.  The early Christians chose these Gospels because they knew their work --better than some modern scholars, it seems to me, who are making absolute fools of themselves by pushing such wares, when they ought to know better.    <br />I rather like Pagels, and I think she is trying to be honest.  Some of the points she makes about the psychology of martyrdom and orthodoxy make sense to me.  I find more sense in that argument than in Crossan's invention of the &quot;Cross Gospel,&quot; Mack's fanciful sociological studies of imagined Q communities, still more the &quot;Jesus Conspiracy&quot; theories of Doherty, Freke or Gandy.  But really, isn't it time skeptical historians defined what they mean by &quot;Gospel,&quot; instead of using it as a prop to make unlikes sound the same?  Isn't it time they argue for their beliefs historically, rather than making casual jumps to skeptical assumptions by saying, &quot;Many of us can no longer believe all that,&quot; and thereafter simply ignore evidence that points to &quot;all that?&quot;  Until skeptical historians bring their arguments out of the hothouse and face critism squarely, it is hard for me to see why those arguments should be taken seriously.  <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2003-10-02

I thought this story fairly balanced and enlightening, and less angry than some politically animated attacks on the early Christians.  Pagels generally identifies speculation as such.  She gives many quotes, and her scholarship seems pretty reliable.  Her main animus seems to be against Tertillian and Ignatius.  They must be flattered by the attention -- I hope I'm still being refuted 1800 years from now.   All in all, I found this volume well worth a read. <BR> <BR>But it's an odd book in some ways.      <BR> <BR>First of all, there are, of course, no Gnostic Gospels.  Gospel means good news, and as Pagels admits, the Gnostic texts hardly even pretend to relate historical events.  They are phony as the wild tales told about Confucius in the Zhuang Zi (and less funny), or the Jesus of Muslim Sufis. They make Jesus sound like Apollonius of Tyana or Sai Baba.  There is obviously a market for making Christ a less lonely figure in world religion.  <br />Pagels presents the orthodox and Gnostic faiths as equally legitimate.  &quot;Without denying the resurrection,&quot; the Gnostics &quot;reject the literal interpretation.&quot;  What does that mean?  &quot;Without denying that I ate all my dinner, I do not claim to have done so literally.  Now, can I have desert?&quot;  <br />Pagels wants us to think that the &quot;orthodox&quot; believed in the resurrection because it provided the basis, somehow, for apostolic power.  &quot;What we do know as a historical fact is that certain disciples -- notably Peter -- claimed that the resurrection had happened.&quot;  But actually, the Gospels credit a group of powerless women with seeing Jesus first.  All four Gospels, almost every sermon recorded in the Book of Acts by Peter or Paul, and quite a bit of the writings of Paul, focus on the resurrection of Jesus.  This claim got many of them killed.  Pagel's argument that, since a rag-tag group of esoteric mystics who lived elsewhere a hundred years later doubted those accounts, therefore there was &quot;controversy&quot; on the subject, and early Christians could only have been motivated by desire for power to believe the people who were actually near the event, is exceedingly odd. <BR> <BR>Pagels justifies her view by downplaying the historicity of the Gospels.  She claims that few modern Bible scholars &quot;believe that contemporaries of Jesus actually wrote the New Testament gospels.&quot;  This is not so.  Jesus' contemporaries could easily have lived well past the time at which even many skeptical scholars say the Gospels were written.  <br />&quot;Can we find any actual, historical reasons why these gnostic writings were suppressed?&quot;  Pagels asks.  Sure, just read the things.  &quot;For the first time, the heretics can speak for themselves.&quot;  Not a moment too soon, from the orthodox perspective.  Giving the Gnostics air time is the best way to demonstrate the wisdom of those who excluded them from the canon.<br />In a comparative study I made of Thomas, the Gospels, and other ancient literature, I found far fewer marks of historical authenticity or similarity to the Gospels in Thomas than any other documents.  Of 45 characteristics the Gospels shared, many having to do with historical reliability, Thomas shared only 5; less than almost any other text I studied, even texts from China.   Pagels herself notes a few of the differences between the real Gospels and the Gnostics.   She admits the Gnostics are late, distant, and a little spacey.  So why didn't those darn Christians publish their manuscripts?  Must have been a political conspiracy!<BR> <BR>Pagels might more reasonably have arranged the facts here into an argument like this.  Religions evolve.  They sometimes split into competing lineages, exaggerate differences, attack one another, and lose valuable elements from their original formulation.  Both 'orthodox' and Gnostic should have listened to Jesus more carefully, since their errors arise from disobedience to the Gospels, their wisdom in following the Gospels.  (Something similar happened to Confucianism after Confucius.)   <BR> <BR>'Orthodox' Christians, however, held on to a belief in historicity and in the genuine words of Jesus, rather than diluting them with shamanistic additions that would have made Christianity indistinguishable from a bhakti cult of Hinduism.  This had useful consequences.  For however mysogenist or authoritarian some early Christians may have been, it was the Christian church that began developing institutions of pluralistic freedom in the Middle Ages, and ultimately democracy.  Similarly, the status of women is highest in the world today precisely in countries with an 'orthodox' Christian heritage.  So some part of Jesus' message must ultimately have sifted through.  <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2003-09-24

Unlike some reviewers, I found Lenten Lands well-written, poignant, and honest, though it dies a bit towards the end.  (As auto-biographies often do -- if the author doesn't die first, like Moses.)  I am not sure why some reviewers complain that Douglas chose to tell his story, even if his memories of Lewis were not as full, say, as George Sayers, and he has lived a fairly simple, even blue-color, life at times.  Greshem's descriptions of growing up, the houses he lived in, taking the boat to England, London and Oxford, and the Kilns, were all interesting to me, though as a fan of Lewis I was of course anticipating scenes of his life.  Greshem brings nature, his feelings, the drama of watching his mother come to love C. S. Lewis and the love returned, then her death, to life.  The scene in which his dying but still fiercely defensive mother confronts a trespasser with a shotgun, C. S. Lewis standing alarmed at her side, and yells, \\"Get out of my line of fire, Jack!\\", and the scenes that follow, made me laugh for a fair chunk of an hour.  <br />I didn't expect this book to all be about Lewis; hasn't he had enough pure biographies already?  I was pleased to learn much more about Joy, whom Douglas and \\"Jack\\" both greatly loved.  (Having read her Smoke on the Mountain, I agree she had talent and insight -- though Douglas' claim that she was an intellectual match for Lewis should be described as filial, I think.)

Having read Scapegoat, and leafed through a couple other of Girard's works, I found this book a readable and concise introduction to Girard's ideas.  (Or idea, or complex of insights.)  Readability helps, because frankly, I don't find Girard always that easy to follow, though worth the attempt.  Golsan offers a somewhat chronological overview of mimetic theory, leading from Girard's observations of the nature of desire in literature, (chapter 1) following the bouncing ball into myth (chapter 3) and the history of sacrifice and scapegoating that supposedly undergirds it. (chapter 2)  Chapter four is entitled \\"The Bible: Antidote to Violence,\\" and clearly lays out perhaps the most controversial aspect of Girardian theory.  Appropriately, given the questions these sections are bound to raise, the following chapter discusses \\"Girard's Critics and the Girardians.\\"  (In a pretty even-handed way.) Having outlined his topic, Golsan is clever at this point to break up the flow of exposition and end the main body of his book with a long, eloquent interview of his subject.  A 28 page appendix then offers Girard's analysis of a South African snake myth, no doubt as a sample of goods on offer.  <br />I found each of the main chapters illuminating, though I did not read much of the appendix.  Girard's theory of human violence does, I think, shed valuable light on human history, literature, mythology, and the Gospels.  I have found myself reading events -- such as the attempt to scapegoat the Jewish state after 9-11 -- in its light.  I don't think Girard's theory should be spread too thin -- the Gospels help us \\"demystify sacrificial violence,\\" it is true, but they also help us to many other things, and both share and diverge from myth in other ways as well.  But this book helped me get an overview of a fascinating and most important theory.  I also discovered, in the interview, that Girard is capable of both humility and a sly wit that I found delightful.  His way of dealing withfeminist critics is a hoot -- he must have been quite a ladies' man. <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man	2003-08-23

I tried to find a reason to give this book more than one star, really I did.  It is moderately well-written, I told myself.  But why must Mack be so pompous?  Why the wildly inflated view of himself and other Q critics, and contempt for the common sense of ordinary readers?  Some of the background facts about Greco-Roman culture and cynicism were mildly interesting.  But why, since Mack wants to make the case that Jesus was a Cynic, do none of his Cynic quotes sound at all like anything in the Gospels?   <br />Mack raised a lot of questions in my mind, but never answered them.  For example, if the early Christian church evolved so radically and mutated so dramatically as Mack claims in the first thirty years, (only as long as I have been a Christian!) why didn't the people who had known Jesus (many of whom must have still been very much alive) say something?  And why did this only happen in Palestine?  Why did Paul and the other apostolic writers all buy the Gospel story about the death of Jesus for our sins, and resurrection from the dead?  Why do most scholars reject Mack's argument?  (N.T. Wright more recently dispatched of Mack in about eight pages (Jesus and the Victory of God, 35-44), with a thoroughness that would drive \\"all the king's horses and all the king's men\\" to despair.  But he couldn't have been the first.)  What does Mack say to such criticism?  On all this and much more, he offers not a peep. <br />Actually, there is no evidence here Mack has even read any arguments against his position.  Instead, he speaks like an oracle from on high.  There is no trace of scholarly dialogue in this book, instead what you get is a monologue in an echo chamber.  This is, to put it mildly, an odd approach for an allegedly scholarly argument.  <br />As for positive criticisms, where should I begin?  With the<BR>title?  The word \\"Gospel\\" means \\"good news,\\" not \\"good ideas.\\"  Q is not, therefore, a Gospel, and the title is itself a bit of a fraud.   <BR> <BR>More seriously, Mack writes in the book too much as if he held a copy of the hypothetic Q in his hands.  But he hasn't got Q.  Worse, for Mack's theory, we do have a large and varied number of writings from the early Christian church, written within the lifetimes of the first disciples, that DO speak of the crucifixion and resurrection.  All of these agree with the real Gospels that Jesus died on the cross and rose again from the dead.  <br />To argue from the silence of one lone document, and that a document nobody has seen, or was even mentioned by the early church, and attempt by that imagined testimony to overthrow the positive testimony of dozens of documents we do have, has got to set some kind of record for the stretching of logic.  It is like accusing someone of murder based on a invisible psychologist's interview of a ghost who refuses to answer questions.  Mack is clearly a man of great faith.  But why should any honest reader buy this malarky?  I haven't got a clue. <BR> <BR>Why did Q not contain an account of the passion?  Maybe it never existed.  Maybe the author forgot to take notes during the crucifixion.  Maybe a goat ate the last chapters.  The truth is, we don't know.  That so many people seem willing and eager to buy into such wild, almost self-parodying speculation (see print reviews, in particular) badly shakes my already weak faith in the desire of skeptics to find truth.  <BR> <BR>...	2003-07-30

I liked the book, but it was sad, because old dan was killed by a mountain lion and little ann got sick and died.  A few days later Billy found a red fern from old dan and little ann's grave, and he showed it to his parents and he said, \\"Do all good dogs go to heaven?\\"  And his mother said, \\"Yes.\\"  And they moved somewhere.	2003-06-10

I enjoyed this yarn, overall, as I do most of Clancy's stuff.  But I wish he wouldn't put so many obstacles in the way of buying into his premise.  First, of course, by the time Ryan has saved the world this many times over, shouldn't he be wearing a cape?  Secondly, I'm having a real hard time imagining a Palestinian Gandhi right now; this part of his premise sounds so American.  Third, the idea that most everybody really wants peace, is hard to pretend to believe, not only after 9/11, but in view of what we have learned about Saudi pop and government culture.  Third, enough of this \\"all religions are equally well-meaning, to prove it I'll point out some bad Christians and some good Muslims\\" stuff.  The president has to say it, but Clancy's a smart guy; can't he shoot for a deeper level of analysis?  <br />Maybe I should stop complaining and enjoy the ride. The story does pick up at the end.  But if Clancy wants us to suspend our doubts, he'd do better to encourage them less in the set-up phase of his next story.	2003-06-02
