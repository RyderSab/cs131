I've been a big fan of James Patterson, and his novels, following them avidly.  But recently, the Alex Cross novels have began to take a downward slide.  I keep reading, in hope that perhaps the next will be better than the previous one read, but so far, I've been let down.  London Bridges was terrible, and made no sense at all.  It appeared to be slapped together without any thought at all.  I'm confused... I thought the Women's Murder Club novels were superb, so what's happening to Alex Cross?	2004-11-19

Stone wasn't expecting anything to happen when he is dragged into attending a party by his ex-partner, Dino.

At first, Elena resists Molly, not wanting any part of it... but is sucked in when she realizes that Molly may indeed be right that her big sister has fallen into deep trouble.<br />Now, Dark Horse is a little slow going, and may lack a little depth, but still manages to be entertaining.  I reccomend it to anyone who likes horses... and Tami Hoag.	2003-01-29
