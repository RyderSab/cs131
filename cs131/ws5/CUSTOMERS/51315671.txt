But I do need to correct the editorial review on this page.  Dove House was in the town of Little Missouri, not Medora - the town of Medora didn't even exist until the end of the second book in this series (Opal).	2005-07-22

The introduction indicates that this is supposed to be a series about 4 girls who were schoolmates, but the other 3 are hardly mentioned in the story, so I assumed this meant that the others would be out soon.  I understand the &quot;House of Winslow&quot; series is supposed to be finished after one more book, maybe then we'll see the next in this series.	2004-01-27

I was glad Grisie's husband was a much nicer person and she was happy in her marriage!

In this book Ramona seems to be more agreeable than Beezus, unlike previous Ramona stories - probably because Beezus is becoming a teenager.  One of the funniest parts is when Beezus insists on getting a haircut at a beauty school on the other end of Portland - they get off at the wrong exit and can't find their way back to the freeway - I made the same mistake in Portland in real life, so that screwy exit DOES exist!	2003-05-21

Ribsy jumps in the wrong car at a shopping center, and 4 girls give him a bubble bath against his will.  Then he runs away from them and has more adventures with other people who find him.  The things that happen to Ribsy in this book are soooo ridiculous, I think in real life he would have been reunited with Henry sooner!	2003-05-21

When all of her nutty relatives get together, it's a reunion from hell!  Then her doctor tells her she only has a year to live, so she decides that she will do and say anything she wants.  At the next family gathering she tells everyone what she's thought of them for years (leading them to believe she's insane), and when the town carpenter mentions his consumptive daughter needing someone to take care of her, Valancy immediately volunteers and leaves home before her mother can stop her.  She also becomes good friends with Barney Snaith, rumored to be a jailbird and many other disreputable things - when Barney's father visits unexpectedly, he reveals the truth about who Barney really is.	2003-05-21

Upon the death of her husband, Julia Hollis and her 3 children,  are forced to leave London and live in the village of Gresham, in an abandoned coaching inn, accompanied by Fiona, a loyal servant who left an abusive past.  A friend loans her enough money to make improvements and eventually they open the home to several paying residents.  The book starts out rather depressing, but once the Hollis family's lodging business is up and running, lots of interesting and humorous plots develop among neighbors, some of whom believe that the Larkspur Inn is haunted, and the Larkspur Inn's owners and boarders.	2002-10-23

This story takes place in 1840.  When Rebekah and her friend are reading Sky's newspaper ad, it states that Asa Mercer took a group of women to Seattle by ship &quot;last year&quot;.  <BR>In real life, Asa Mercer made 2 such trips, in 1864 and 1865, and I understand he was 25 years old in 1865, so that part of the story is incorrect.  In &quot;The Starts for a Light,&quot; #1 in the &quot;Cheney Duvall, M.D.&quot; series, Mr. Mercer is a major character, and based on another book I own, about the history of Seattle, that book is accurate.  Most of the time Mr. Morris's historical characters are presented accurately, I also enjoy books by Janette Oke, and whenever they've written about the same topics, their information is usually consistent.	2002-10-23

Andrew originally moved to Gresham to get his oldest daughter, Elizabeth, away from the man she loved in London when they learned that he was unfaithful to her.  Elizabeth is now seeing a young curate in a nearby village when the other man finds her again - he appears to have changed his ways and asks her forgiveness, and also takes on the position of schoolmaster in Gresham.  You will also enjoy the courtships of other locals, including bossy Mrs. Kingston and the obnoxious lord who owns the cheese factory.	2002-10-23

The title character, Lydia Clark, was previously teaching school in Scotland but has come home to Gresham and lives with her parents, and is now in charge of an advanced school for children who are too old for the regular village school.  Archeologist Jacob Pitney wants to learn about poetry to impress another lady, and asks Lydia to help him, with surprising results.  The ending is great for most characters in the book, but I felt that there was more to be learned about a few characters, and it doesn't appear that a fourth book is in the works so far.	2002-10-23

I've never understood why Rebekah had no last name on the geneology chart at the start of every book (P.S. The chart in Book 27 finally DOES show her last name), but anyway, the story begins with Rebekah Jackson enjoying a social life for the first time when she visits her cousin Nora.  At the end of the visit, Rebekah elopes with a charming man who eventually leaves her alone and pregnant.  Eventually she shares a home with Mary, a single mother who introduces her to God.  Before Mary dies in an epidemic, she asks Rebekah to keep her baby, and urges her to answer an ad place by Sky Winslow for women to become brides in the west.  While sometimes I wanted to throttle one or both of them for their stubbornness, everything works out in the end.	2002-03-14

This story is mainly about Phillip and Amelia, adult children of Andrew Winslow, who is the son of Mark Winslow, the oldest son of Sky and Rebekah Winslow.  As they pursue their chosen careers, both find themselves involved with the family of Big Tony Marino, a notorious gangster who, ironically, really loves his own family.  Phil falls in love with Big Tony's daughter, and Amelia gets her first job as a nightclub singer with the help of Dom Costello, Big Tony's assistant/bodyguard.<BR>Phil gets his first good job with the help of Lee Novak, another grandson of Sky Winslow, and later becomes the District Attorney's assistant.  Also making a return appearance is Wes Winslow (see \\"The Amazon Quest #25) on a photography assignment for someone who is writing about New York.  This is an action-packed story that you'll find difficult to put down!	2002-03-14

Also of note are a couple of name changes - the &quot;Oleson&quot; family was actually the Owens family, and the quarrelsome people she stayed with on her first teaching job were named Bouchie, not Brewster.  Many more surprises await you when you read the story, but I don't want to give everything away!	2001-12-26

Having also read William Anderson's &quot;Laura Ingalls Wilder - a Biography,&quot; this story is much more detailed.  It also includes information about Charles and Caroline's families before they were married, even before they were born!  You'd be surprised at how many things in Laura's books didn't happen exactly that way in real life, i.e., the events of &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; actually happened BEFORE the events described in &quot;Little House in the Big Woods,&quot; and their time living near Lake City, Minnesota and Burr Oak, Iowa are not mentioned in Laura's books.  It's also interesting to note that they lived in both Walnut Grove, Minnesota and the Big Woods of Wisconsin TWICE!  Walnut Grove is where &quot;On the Banks of Plum Creek&quot; took place, even though that name is never mentioned in the book, and the TV series also was supposed to be in Walnut Grove, although it was really filmed in California.  Also, the Olesons and Brewsters actually were not the real names of the rich family in Walnut Grove or the quarrelsome people Laura lived with during her first teaching job.  Great reading if you always wanted to know more about Laura.	2001-12-26

Why not?  Plenty of real-life people have made decisions that way!  There have also been cases of people in love with someone for years before they knew it, I'm glad the story wasn't like that.  Perhaps the reviewer has never had such an experience, but that doesn't mean they know everything!  It's great to have stories where people read the Bible and act on what they've learned, and Janette Oke is one of my favorite Christian writers!  My only complaint is that sometimes it took too long to get through a part of the story that seemed unimportant to me.	2001-12-21

This story takes place after James and Carolina's marriage at the end of &quot;A Hope Beyond.&quot;  As their family continues to grow, James and Carolina leave their beautiful Baltimore home and move to a small house further west so that James can be close to the expanding B&amp;O Railroad, but still be able to come home at night most of the time.  Adopted daughter Victoria falls in love with Kiernan O'Connor, a young Irishman who works closely with James, but at the same time, Kiernan's older brother Red constantly works to turn other workers against James and each other, with tragic results.

In the other books, however, nothing much happened to the ex-girlfriend (other than losing the man), while in this book the &quot;bad&quot; girl was properly punished at the end (sent to jail), and the &quot;nice&quot; girl married the ex-soldier at the end of the story.	2001-12-21

Carolina is being encouraged to marry Hampton Cabot, her father's overseer, but he is actually scheming to take over Oakbridge and enjoys mistreating slaves.  Virginia, not knowing that Carolina really doesn't care for Hampton, decides to get even with her and seduces Hampton, and elopes with him.  Having no reason to stay at Oakbridge, Carolina moves to Baltimore to become a nanny for a little girl whose father doesn't want anything to do with her.  When the father decides to permanently go away, he has a surprising proposal that Carolina must accept to determine the fate of his daughter.

While it's great to find out more about the characters of 6 previous books, none of the 3 sections seem finished. &quot;Hickory Hollow&quot; is about Dan &amp; Katie Fisher's marriage; it sometimes focuses on other characters, but ends without really finishing the story,and the book never returns to those people (i.e., will Katie and Dan be allowed to visit more freely with their Amish families and friends?).  &quot;Bird-in-Hand&quot; centers on Phillip Bradley's attempts to please his Amish neighbors; the man giving him the most trouble has barely become civil to him when the story is over!  In &quot;Grasshopper Level,&quot; Sarah Cain-Ford asks Katie Fisher to sew new clothes for her Amish charges; I'd really like to see them develop more of an acquaintance.

Almost everybody didn't like Cheney and Shiloh &quot;changed&quot; personalities, but I seem to recall their personalities changing back and forth in previous books too - Shiloh angered Cheney by spending time with Maeva Wilding in Book 2, and he was seldom anywhere near Cheney in Book 3; yet in Books 4 and 5, he was there all the time, helping Cheney get around Charleston and taking care of sick people on the Louisiana plantation.  Yes, Bain's actions are unbelievable, but he's not a completely stable person anyway, and many real-life people also do things that don't make sense!  Yes, parts of the book are frustrating, but if I gave up on all books with frustrating parts, I would never have read another Cheney Duval book after the first one (nor would I have tried to read the &quot;House of Winslow&quot; series).

In fact, due to the local libary's limited copies, it was even later before I read Book #1, &quot;The Honorable Imposter&quot;.  Although the description on the book cover leads one to believe that it's a story about a young woman named Rachel Winslow accused of witchcraft, Rachel doesn't even exist until halfway through the book!  The title, &quot;The Captive Bride,&quot; is completely misleading, as no bride is captured or kidnapped anywhere in the story.  The real plot is how Matthew Winslow deserts his wife Lydia before their first child is born, returning years later when his daughter Rachel is now a young woman of about 15, and his family presumes he has died after so many years.  Eventually all of the Winslows are accused of witchcraft and jailed, and eventually are released, although the effect on Gilbert Winslow's health is very bad.  Rachel's younger brother Miles, born after Matthew's return, is instrumental in introducing Rachel to her future husband, but it's a minor part of the story.	2001-11-18

While other reviewers mentioned the female main characters, I enjoyed other characters whose lives were changed by the influence of these women. In the first book, Carl was very bitter about his first wife's death when he married Nora just so she could take care of his children. It wasn't until the end of the book that he realized he had been wrong and asked for God's forgiveness. In the second book, Nora's sister Clara becomes a live-in companion to Mrs. Norgaard, who has lost interest in life since her husband died. Mrs. Norgaard is much happier with Clara in the house, and together they help the local blacksmith, Dag, who has been persecuted by his younger brother Jude since childhood and as a result feels he isn't a worthwhile person. The third book is about Jude; he accidently kills his wife and mother, then drifts to where a schoolhouse is being rebuilt, and he meets and falls in love with the schoolteacher, and is ready to ask forgiveness from the Lord, his brother, and others he has hurt along the way. The fourth book is about a young girl whose father is the local pastor, and her experiences while waiting for a young man called to fight in Germany. Sometimes the character's stubbornness makes you want to scream at them, but everything works out in the end.	2001-08-28

I had a brother who died of muscular distrophy when he was 17, and taking care of my 10-year-old son who also suffers from the same disease has not been easy.

Throughout the visit, they meet with hostility from Mrs. Winslow, and Bain isn't around much anyway, but his sister Brynn is very friendly and takes them on a tour of a Hawaiian crater, and when a volcano's eruption is eminent, Brynn and Cheney are both very good at keeping the people under control and getting them to safety, although Mrs. Winslow and one Chinese man keep causing trouble for everyone. The part of the book dealing with the volcano seems to take forever because of so many details, and I kept getting some of the Hawaiian and Chinese characters mixed up, but there are some wonderful moments too, such as when Nia teaches a Chinese lady about Jesus while the volcano is erupting around them.	2001-05-12

This book introduces several new characters that you'll get to know as well as the main characters in the 4 previous books.  It takes place at a Louisiana plantation owned by Cheney's great-aunts Marye and Elyse.<br />Aunt Elyse is sometimes absent-minded, but is funny and loveable. Aunt Marye, in contrast, seems overly strict, but deep down loves her visiting relatives and their friends.  The lovestruck Chloe, a daughter of Aunt Elyse and Aunt Marye's butler and cook, chases after Shiloh so openly that I wanted to smack her, but she gets what she deserves in the end, especially when they discover she's helping the voodoo group trying to take over the plantation.	2001-05-04

Cheney takes a job in a San Francisco hospital as its first female physician.  Despite a few problems that erupt, for the most part she enjoys her job, with occasional outings with her friends.  Shiloh meets Bain Winslow from Hawaii, who turns out to be his first real lead as to who his real parents are.  Some parts of this book may seem frustrating, while others go very quickly.  This is probably one of the most important books in the series (and of course, you have to read them all to know what's going on)!	2001-05-04

This book shows a very accurate description of the Klondike gold rush, it's amazing how well it's done.  Cass and Serena, also accompanied by Cass's cousins Aaron and Jubal Winslow, set out together at the start, but after Jubal is killed in an avalanche after he pushes Aaron out of the way, Aaron is promptly discouraged and returns home (see Book #18 to see what happens to Aaron after that).  It's great that they reintroduced Joe Winslow, their grandfather Sky's oldest son, introduced in Book #7, and virtually forgotten since then.  Parts of the story tend to drag out, but everything comes right in the end, as usually happens in all &quot;House of Winslow&quot; books.	2000-11-17

This is one of the best Grace Livingston Hill books I've ever written.  It's great to see how Margaret befriends a bunch of rough-acting cowboys and they become her most loyal friends, even rescuing her when a jealous teenage girl plays a cruel trick that leaves her stranded alone in the desert. <br />One of the funniest parts is when several cowboys take a very bad excuse for a Presbyterian minister out and dunk him in a water trough after he preaches about how you don't need God in your life as long as you do good otherwise.  Lance proves to be a good man time and again, although he tries to convince Margaret that he's not that wonderful.	2000-11-17

This story is a Grace Livingston Hill rarity, in which the main character does not find a husband/wife at the end of the story. Lucretia &quot;Crete&quot; Ward is a nice old lady who lives with her sister Carrie and niece Luella, both of whom are very selfish and treat her like a slave.  Upon learning that Donald, the son of their now-deceased older sister, is coming to visit from out west, Luella fears what others will think of them if they are seen with a &quot;backwoods cousin,&quot; so she and her mother hurry away to a fancy resort where Luella is anxious to pursue a young man she is convinced is interested in her, which proves to be all in her head.  Donald is actually well-educated and rich, and loves Aunt Crete like a mother, taking her shopping for fancy clothes and paying for French maids to fix up her hair, and then to the very resort where Luella and Carrie are staying.  At first they believe Aunt Crete must be rich and famous because she seems to have the best of everything and makes friends with the family of the young man Luella has her heart set on.  When they finally recognize her, they try to order Aunt Crete to leave before she &quot;embarasses&quot; them.  Donald takes her traveling elsewhere, and she never returns to the women who mistreated her.	2000-11-17

There were several places in the book where I would have liked to knock some sense into Micah Sinclair for his stubbornness.  His father and stepmother, Benjamin and Elise, are minor characters in the story, whereas a trail guide in &quot;Texas Angel,&quot; a minor character in that book, is now a Texas Ranger and saves Micah's neck more than once, especially when he is sentenced to be executed as a horse thief.  <br />Micah takes several years to finally forgive his father for the past, and to overlook the fact that the lady who loves him (despite her father's misgivings) is half-Mexican.  The ending seems rather hurried to me, as though a whole year is suddenly thrown into the last 2 chapters and leaves you wondering, &quot;what were these people doing since the the previous chapter?&quot;	2000-11-14

I would like to ask the writer of the publisher's synopsis one question:  Who the heck is Angela?  There is no such person in the book, the main character's name is Elise.  I assumed that maybe she changes her name somewhere in the story, but that's not the case.  <br />The story follows the pattern of the &quot;Lone Star&quot; trilogy, wherein the main character in the first book is a woman forced into a very abusive situation, and is eventually rescued by an unlikely source (only this time it's a self-righteous minister, and not a band of outlaws).  I really wanted to smack that minister, as well as the members of Elise's former family that denied her when her mother's former owner came to claim her.  There are a couple of characters in the book who appear to be undesireables on the surface, but are actually good men (i.e., the Sinclairs' guide on the trail, and the minister's &quot;mountain man&quot; brother).  Not to spoil the surprise, but if you read the sequel, &quot;Heaven's Road,&quot; you learn what happened to the oldest son after he ran away from home and get re-introduced to the Sinclairs' trail guide.	2000-11-14

I enjoyed the book overall, although I wished they had been a little more specific about how the people who wanted to steal everyone's land were convinced to give up their plan.  Despite how the synopsis on the cover is written, Cheney actually did make some friends among the mountain people - you would think they were 100% against her in every way by that description!	2000-11-08

I was first introduced to Gilbert Morris when I ordered the first &quot;Cheney Duvall MD&quot; book from a mail-order book club.  Later, I purchased &quot;The Jeweled Spur,&quot; because I enjoyed the other Gilbert Morris book - I hadn't heard of the &quot;House of Winslow&quot; series until my purchase arrived.  I finished reading about Laurie and Cody and looking at the geneology chart included in the book, and just had to read the rest of the series,(based on the local library's availability)as well as new additions.  Keep up the good work!	2000-11-06

I purchased this collection from Avon several months ago, and was very displeased with Isabella Alden's false information about Mormons - I received credit from Avon, but as they didn't want it back, I removed the slanderous Isabella Alden story and &quot;blacked out&quot; all references to it elsewhere on the cover.  NOW it's a good book.	2000-10-26

After reading the review by &quot;A reader from Alberta, Canada,&quot; I am appalled by the misinformation this person provides.  Just to make sure, I went home and read the entire series, and there is NO instance where they laugh at Andrew for being naughty, and there is at least one spanking, where Andrew let the sheep out when he knew better.  &quot;Alberta, Canada&quot; obviously has this book mixed up with something else.	2000-10-20

I really enjoyed the book, but it's the shortest &quot;Little House&quot; book ever written.  The story ends abruptly when a family friend leaves to  join the war; I would have liked to see the story continue on, like maybe  what happened to the friend, whether he was killed in battle or came back  to marry his sweetheart, etc. I'm assuming there just wasn't enough  information available.	2000-08-31
