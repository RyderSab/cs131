There's also a lot of well-put advice on etiquette, protecting your privacy, and otherwise flourishing in the blogosphere, along with some historical background that most journalistic accounts of weblogging have missed.

It's the story of a Marine in the Pacific, written by his military-officer son and drawing on wartime diaries, official records, and interviews with surviving members of his unit, the Marine Ninth Defense Battalion. McCall makes clear the hardships these men endured, the camaraderie that they shared, and the way in which their experiences changed their lives forever. In fact, the book's backstory is his coming to understand how many of the personality characteristics that made his father a hard man to know were products of the Pacific War. If you're interested in military history, you won't be disappointed in this book.	2001-08-14

Kornbluth	Books	5	38	39	N	N	One of the best books I've ever bought	OK, I've read most of these stories already.  And I already knew that Kornbluth was a great writer.  But reading this volume all the way through -- and in pretty short order because I couldn't stop -- just reminded me how great a writer he was.<br />If you have only dim memories of these stories, I guarantee that upon rereading them you'll be amazed at how much *better* they are than you remember.  (Not all science fiction of that era holds up so well).  If you've never read these stories, prepare to be amazed.  This is a book that every lover of science fiction -- or just good writing -- should own, and read.	2001-08-04

I haven't read those chapters, though, because the book works very well as is:  somebody, either Harlan or his editors, did an excellent job of cutting without butchering.<br />His world isn't quite our world in the same era, of course:  the Roman Empire never fell in his.  But he brings the era alive and carries a complex story through many twists and turns without losing the reader's attention.  A very enjoyable book, full of lots of interesting historical nuggets.	2001-08-04

But they're even better as a team.  This book has the difficult job of moving the story along to a fairly foregone conclusion (er, I don't think Belisarius is going to lose in the end -- sorry if I'm giving that away) but it does so very well.<br />Worth the hardcover price, if you're into this series already.

But this series just keeps going.  The characterization is excellent, the plotting is excellent (I figured out in the previous volume where Jake Featherston was heading, and was happy to see I was right) and, well, there's just nothing to complain about here:  it's classic Turtledove at the top of his game.  In a word, superb.<br />Like the others in this series, it's worth the hardcover price.  If you're a Turtledove fan, you won't be disappointed.  If you're not a Turtledove fan, it's because you haven't read this series.	2001-08-04

The execution is fine, but he's not being pushed very hard.  The book is fairly funny, but Flint's writing talents go way beyond this, and at times you get the feeling that Flint knows it.<br />I paid full hardcover price for this book, and I wouldn't recommend that others do the same.

The magic in this book is just a plot device -- it does no real work except to occasionally have a spell misfire in some uninteresting way.  Turtledove has done some very interesting work with magic (see, e.g., the Toxic Spell Dump) but he hasn't done it here.  I love Turtledove's work, but this book offers little to the reader to justify its hardcover price.  It's not actually bad, you understand, just not up to his usual standards.  I'd put it into a class with &quot;Into the Darkness,&quot; which shares its flaws.<br />Harry, you're a hell of a writer.

Egan, however, sticks it out and the results justify the effort.  In truth, I found the ending a bit disappointing, but the trip was so good that I still give this book 5 stars.  This book would be worth the price in hardcover -- so buy the paperback and use the money you save to buy some other Egan books (Permutation City, which is a sort of prequel, might be a good next purchase if you like this one).  Egan does for science fiction novels what Mobius Dick does for Techno music -- he rules!	2000-12-23

Sadly,  his prediction of governmental behavior is less of a stretch, and more  plausible.

The politicians, corrections industry, and opinion pollsters have formed an &quot;Iron Triangle&quot; in support of  ever more incarceration.  In particular, large numbers of nonviolent  offenders are being locked up for no good reason at all.  (The resulting  clog tends to make it harder to put away those who really belong behind  bars, too.) The really bad consequences of this (millions of people with  grudges against society, learning a lot about violence) have yet to really  be visited upon our society.  But they probably will be, and it won't be  the politicians and lobbyists who pay the price.	2000-07-17

Regis's story of the U.S. and British biological warfare program leaves the reader very relieved upon reaching the part about how the program was abandoned when the Biological Weapons  Convention of 1972 was signed.   Unfortunately, the next part of his book  discusses how the USSR responded to that agreement -- which it signed -- by  launching an all-out biological warfare program that created weaponized  stocks of superlethal smallpox, bubonic plague, etc.  Those stocks still  exist and threaten the world today.  Nor were the Russians the only  violators.  Apparently, once the US abandoned the field, other nations  concluded that it had become possible for them to obtain a decisive  advantage by doing research; before, they had assumed that the US would  promptly match any developments, preventing them from achieving any  advantage.  A devastating example of the Law of Unintended Consequences,  and something to remember when other calls for relinquishing technology  appear.	2000-07-04

The action is a bit slow at the beginning, but picks up.  There is -- in my opinion -- just a bit too much hand-wringing and soul-searching  among the protagonists.  Yes, I know Flint has a point to make.  And it's a  good one, and he makes it.  But he makes it much more smoothly in  &quot;1632&quot; than here.  But, then, this is his first novel and  &quot;1632&quot; is, what, his 4th?  There is a learning curve -- but this  novel starts out pretty high up on the curve already.	2000-07-03

Except it wasn't a waste, because it's an excellent book.  There's more action among the other characters, but Belisarius remains at the center of this story.   Aide becomes more humanized (and occasionally a bit *too* cute), and the  story continues.  If you liked the earlier books, you'll like this one;  it's every bit as good.  Also, this book (very much like early Heinlein) is  not only a great story, but one with a moral point.  It's not heavy-handed,  but it's there, and it's good.  Bravo!	2000-06-21

But, like most post-Strangelove Kubrick, it did so at the expense of a narrative.  In the book, Clarke takes care of such  mundane matters as givign the reader an idea of what's going on.  Indeed,  the book is more visionary than the movie in many ways.  Clarke's brief  discussion of the aliens' history -- from biological creatures, to robotic  intelligences, to something far greater -- is the sort of thing Ray  Kurzweil writes happily about (and Bill Joy writes unhappily about) today.   But Clarke wrote it over 30 years ago.  As usual, he was ahead of his time.	2000-06-21

It's terrific.  Smith's real-world experience really shows by comparison to the many other books written in this area.  The reader may feel that he or  she is standing at Smith's elbow as she interviews teenage murderers in a  prison, or listens to a tormented &quot;geek&quot; pour out his suffering.   Yet the book doesn't lapse into anecdotal accounts:  Smith keeps a very  clear eye on the big picture, and offers not only insights into what these  kids are thinking, but also a wide array of practical proposals for dealing  with juvenile violence.  This book should be read by anyone with an  interest -- professional or personal -- in juvenile violence, and by those  who simply want to see what life is like on the frontlines with today's  disturbed youth.	2000-06-21

That's the lesson of &quot;The Tipping Point.&quot;  Want to lower crime in New York?  You could address all problems of poverty and alienation.  Or you could just clean up graffiti and start  arresting people who pee in the street. Gladwell's premise, which he states  interestingly and for the most part convincingly, is that small social  cues, linked with group effects, can produce major social changes.  The  book can be read in an evening, and offers an interesting departure from  conventional wisdom.  My only complaint is that Gladwell's analysis  overlaps considerably with the study of memetics, which he unaccountably  doesn't mention.  But this is a quibble.

The very beginning is a bit rough, but Flint quickly hits his stride and produces an alternate history work worthy of Turtledove or  Stirling.  In fact, the closest parallel is to Stirling's Island in the Sea  of Time series, but although that parallel is obvious, it is also not as  great as it first appears.  Despite the structural parallels (mining an old  science-fiction style), this is a very different story from Stirling's.   That said, if you enjoy Stirling's work, you'll probably enjoy this one.   I've taken great pleasure in Flint's earlier work, especially the  coauthored Belisarius series, and I'm happy to see him produce such an  excellent tale on his own.  I assume there's a sequel?	2000-02-14

I bought it then, loved it, and loaned my copy to somebody who never returned it.  I recently bought this paperback edition and reread it.  The book is  every bit as terrific as I remembered.  Chris Mead has done an astonishing  job of reconstructing history and of reminding Americans just how different  the world was in the 1930s and 1940s.  This is a work of discernment and  sensitivity -- but it's also an exciting page turner, even if you know how  the story comes out.

Rauch puts his finger on the reason why  special-interest gridlock creates a polity that is considerably less than  the sum of its parts.

Oh, to be Neal Stephenson, and have to clout to get a publisher to publish a nonfiction volume containing an essay that's already available on the Web for free.  And, oh, to be Neal Stephenson and write an essay that's still  worth paying for.<br />Some of his points have been made elsewhere in  different contexts (&quot;The Appearance of Impropriety:  How the Ethics  Wars Have Undermined American Government, Business and Society&quot; makes  similar points about the growing role of appearance in American society)  but Stephenson makes them so well, and ties things together so cleanly,  that even when they're not new they sound that way.  Like this  one:<br />&quot;During this century, intellectualism failed, and everyone  knows it.  In places like Russia and Germany, the common people agreed to  loosen their grip on traditional folkways, mores, and religion, and let the  intellectuals run with the ball, and they screwed everything up and turned  the century into an abattoir.  Those wordy intellectuals used to be merely  tedious; now they seem kind of dangerous as well.<br />&quot;We Americans are  the only ones who didn't get creamed at some point during all of this.  We  are free and prosperous because we have inherited political and value  systems fabricated by a particular set of eighteenth century intellectuals  who happened to get it right.

First, it's full of inconsistencies.  Do people's minds travel among parallel universes, or their bodies?  The answer:  both, with no reason  given for why it's sometimes one and sometimes the other. Second, the basic  plot is mostly hackneyed.  The one original twist is a heavyhanded allusion  to TV channel-surfing that isn't enough to sustain a novel.  It might have  worked for a short story.  Perhaps that's what this book is:  a short story  stretched into a short novel.  Anyway, I left it feeling cheated, an  experience I have never had with a Barnes book before.	2000-01-07

It is clearly written, and can easily be followed by  non-lawyers and non-historians.  Nonetheless, the analysis is  sophisticated.<br />The two parts most likely to draw attention are Levy's  treatment of the Second and Ninth amendments to the Constitution.  With  regard to the Second, Levy joins the overwhelming number of constitutional  scholars and historians who believe the Second Amendment protects an  individual right to arms.  And he does so unequivocally:  &quot;Believing  that the amendment does not authorize an individual's right to keep and  bear arms is wrong.  The right to bear arms is an individual right. . . .   Moreover, the right to bear arms does not necessarily have a military  connotation, because Pennsylvania, whose constitution of 1776 first used  the phrase 'the right to bear arms,' did not even have a state  militia.&quot;  (pp. 134-35).  Levy even criticizes Harvard professor  Laurence Tribe for saying otherwise (136) -- though in fact Tribe has  changed his position and now agrees with Levy.  But this took place as  Levy's book was in press.  At any rate, revisionist writers such as Garry  Wills will find little comfort in this book.<br />On the Ninth Amendment, Levy  may annoy many who disagree with him about the Second (and vice versa).   Levy argues that the Ninth Amendment was meant to protect both positive  rights (e.g., voting, the presumption of innocence, etc.) and natural  rights, which he identifies with the Declaration of Independence's  &quot;Life, Liberty and Pursuit of Happiness.&quot;  He has little patience  with those who claim otherwise:  &quot;To argue that the Framers had used  natural rights as a means of escaping obligations of obedience to the king  but did not use natural rights 'as a source for rules of decision' is  hogwash. One has only to read the state recommendations for a bill of  rights to know that the natural rights philosophy seized the minds of the  Framers as it had the minds of the rebellious patriots of 1776.  One can  also read natural rights opinions by members of the early Supreme Court to  arrive at the same conclusion.&quot;  (p. 255).  So much for the narrow  originalist theories of, for example, Robert Bork.<br />That the book heaps  scorn on the half-baked theories of Garry Wills and Robert Bork is just a  bonus, though.  In substance, it is strong.  The writing style is graceful.   And the coverage is remarkably complete for such a slim volume.  Great  work, indeed.	1999-11-22

I think I know why.  Lewis is, himself, a Wall  Street/political kind of guy.  He's not a geek.  So it's much harder for  him to understand Geek World.  Works like Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon  do a better job of that -- but in a way only geeks, or at least quasi  geeks, can understand.  I'd bet that the people giving this book strong  reviews are non-geeks, and the people giving it lukewarm reviews (like this  one) are geeks (like me).  Lewis probably does a good job translating the  world to non-geeks, but something is inevitably lost in the translation.   That's what the inhabitants of Geek World are noticing -- just as a native  speaker of French might disapprove of an English translation of Rabelais.   The only other complaint is that in his coverage of the Microsoft trial,  the lawyers -- especially for the government -- are made to look stupid and  ineffectual.  Lewis couldn't know, of course, how it would turn out, but  the joke's on him.  No matter how many billions you have, you trifle with  lawyers at your peril.  At the end of the day, often *they* have the  billions.  Just ask the tobacco companies!	1999-11-22

It's also an underappreciated piece of work in today's debate over the scope of government.  On the one hand we have people like Garry  Wills arguing that, since the Framers weren't anarchists, the Constitution  supports modern-day Big Government.  On the other, we have equally-wacky  people on the right arguing that, since the Framers were revolutionaries,  Timothy McVeigh is some sort of hero.<br />In fact, both are equally wrong.   As Maier's book points out, the colonial era was not one in which people  accepted the 20th Century Weberian notion of the state as holding a  monopoly on legitimate violence.  Many sorts of &quot;insurrectionary&quot;  violence -- of the sort that Gordon Wood calls &quot;out of doors&quot;  political action -- were implicitly, and explicitly, recognized as  legitimate.<br />But that's not the same as saying that all violence was okay.   In fact, as Maier points out again and again, colonists recognized  fundamental limits on the scope, degree, and targets of popular resistance.   Violence might be okay, but mostly against property -- and when against  individuals, only nonlethal violence in most situations.  Maier's book  shows a far more sophisticated theory than appears in today's left- and  right-wing caricatures of the Framers.  It's also wonderfully readable and  copiously documented.  It should get more attention -- and with luck it  will.	1999-11-22

Universally, the response was:  &quot;Yeah, that's how we should do things.

Finally I figured out what it was.  Wills is seeming more and more like the Robert Bork of the left.  Like Bork, he argues from history and intent.  Like  Bork, he takes positions (for example, on the Second Amendment) that fly in  the face of virtually all the scholarship on the subject.  And, most  distressingly like Bork, he assumes that since everyone but him is wrong  (that is, disagrees with Bork/Wills), that is evidence that everyone else  is either stupid or dishonest.  It is, of course, always possible that  everyone else *is* wrong, and that Wills *is* right -- but Wills does not  come close to meeting the burden that one adopting such a position should  carry.<br />His central point -- that the Framers weren't anarchists -- is  true, but trivial.  No one with any sense thinks they were.  His other  points, however, ignore the fact that they *were* revolutionaries.  Also  like Bork, Wills tries to graft late-20th-century (well, really mid-20th  century) political theories onto people who held very different views.  Most like Bork of all, his book will no doubt be used by people who agree  with him politically to suggest that there is solid historical support for  their position.  That will work until enough people read it to realize how  intellectually thin it is.<br />I have generally been a fan of Wills, but this  work is the proverbial thirteenth chime of the clock -- not only wrong in  itself, but calling into question everything that came before.  For a more  accurate take on many of these issues try Pauline Meier's &quot;From  Resistance to Revolution,&quot; Joyce Lee Malcolm's &quot;To Keep and Bear  Arms,&quot; Leonard Levy's &quot;Origins of the Bill of Rights,&quot; and  Gary Hart's &quot;The Minuteman:  Restoring an Army of the People.&quot;	1999-11-22

I had the experience of rereading it just  after reading Stephen Ambrose's &quot;Citizen Soldiers,&quot; and the  congruence between the two books was astonishing.  Beyond that, however,  it's a surprisingly sophisticated meditation on what it takes to make a  society work when -- as always -- most of its members would rather be free  riders.  Starship Troopers is a thought experiment along those lines that  seems surprisingly prescient today.  Ignore the movie tie in.  Although the  film quoted some big chunks of the book verbatim, it completely missed the  point of the book, and was mostly about killing big bugs with surprisingly  primitive weaponry and amazingly unsophisticated tactics.	1999-11-22

Like &quot;Starship Troopers,&quot; it addresses what remains a  core problem:  how do you maintain a free society when (1) doing so  requires self-discipline and hard work; and (2) most people don't want to  engage in either?

This is not high-end Turtledove of the &quot;Worldwar&quot; or &quot;Guns  of the South&quot; level.  Really, the Fox books are more like Heinlein's  celebrated junior novels in some ways (though they have sex).  The Fox  theme is an extended and entertaining study of the abundant benefits of  clear thinking and the ability to be self-critical.  Adults will enjoy  these books -- they're not kiddie novels -- but they have the same  Heinleinian themes of competence and moral responsibility.  My only caveat:   this is two previously published books under one cover.  (Prince of the  North and Werenight).  That's a good deal if you haven't read them, but be  sure.

Well, maybe not.  But his books come out with huge gaps between them, which is too bad  because they're all good.  (Yeah, I know, another of my favorites is Harry  Turtledove, who probably writes too much.  Maybe these two should exchange  some blood or something.) This book returns to the universe of &quot;Steel  Beach&quot; and has some slight character overlap (Hildy Johnson, the  Heinleiners) at the end.  But it's a fundamentally freestanding story set  in a very interesting place.  The leading character, &quot;Sparky&quot;  Valentine, is believable for those of us who've been around theatre, and  has just the sort of brilliantly one-sided personality that makes for  lively reading.  Varley does a first-rate job of getting inside Valentine's  head -- even to producing such actorly malapropisms as &quot;coriolanus  force.&quot;  Well worth the money and time.	1999-10-25

Less a novel, really, than an extended meditation on fear and courage using the Spartans as exemplars, and expositors, of an older  view of courage than typically appears in movies of the &quot;Rambo&quot;  variety.  The Spartans, as Pressfield repeatedly demonstrates, look down on  bluster or fury as inappropriate to true men.  Bluster is dismissed as  &quot;pseudandreia&quot; or false courage; berserker-like fury is dismissed  as &quot;catalepsis&quot; or possession.  An excellent book to read along  with nonfiction works like Stephen Ambrose's &quot;Citizen Soldiers&quot;  or Dave Grossman's &quot;On Killing.&quot;  Nonetheless, the book kept me  almost &quot;possessed&quot; until I finished it.

But despite her age, she's basically a spoiled child:  self-centered, judgmental, irresponsible, and largely ignorant of  the world.  This has one major flaw:  she's so damned unlikeable that I  found it hared to really get into the book for the first couple of hundred  pages.  Perhaps the authors were a bit heavy handed in their portrayal,  though I've certainly known women lawyers like this character.

Oh, in this case it's the fathers of the men she interviews, but women curiously get a pass in this  book, even though they aren't that attractive in their behavior.  One woman  leaves her husband when he develops cancer because, she says, &quot;I  wasn't into that whole Florence Nightingale thing.&quot;  Other women leave  their husbands when they lose their jobs because -- even though they  themselves demand the freedoms of 1990s women -- they see the man as a  1950s-style provider who has failed in his appointed role.  *This* to me  seems the real problem:  men correctly see that they are held to 1950s  standards -- often by the very women who denounced those standards when  applied to women -- while women get to choose modern or old-fashioned  standards as suits them.<br />Nonetheless, Faludi is pretty good so long as  she sticks to her journalistic role and avoids theorizing.  The stories she  reports are interesting and -- despite an excessive focus on the  dysfunctional -- often illuminating.  But she should have tried  interviewing ordinary men who were doing well.	1999-10-11

The only flaw is that the historical Justinian II is not a very appealing protagonist.  It's not just that few  readers will like him.  It's that few readers will even identify with him.   He's a jerk, and he gets his comeuppance.<br />This excellent historical novel  about a fascinating historical figure simply proves that  Turtledove/Turteltaub can make up more interesting characters than exist in  real life.  The book is very much worth reading for those who share my  interest in Byzantium.  Others might be well advised to read some of  Turtledove's more imaginative works of fiction.<br />And what's this  &quot;H.N. Turteltaub&quot; stuff?

Just compare it to his two other hardcover releases this year (!), &quot;The Great War:  A Walk in  Hell&quot; and &quot;Colonization:  Second Contact&quot; and it's obvious  that this is the runt of the litter.  From page to page it's okay, but it's  a draft -- there's little plot unity, with lots of battle scenes that don't  really advance the story.  I had hoped for a lot of clever and creative  magic use, as in the &quot;Toxic Spell Dump&quot; series, but that never  really materializes.  The one subplot that revolves around magic is  marginal to the story.  Note to Turtledove:  You have a great talent, so  don't waste it on second-tier projects.  What, you can't send your kids to  college on the royalties from all your *other* books?  Note to publishers:   Pay Turtledove more money so he can put more time into fewer projects!	1999-09-02

Some parts of their analysis are less persuasive than others -- the notion of amending the Constitution without formal amendment, for example -- but overall the book is certain to arouse interest in many quarters.	1998-07-30

Its academic / sociological approach may put off some lay readers, but that would be too bad.  The subject, and the message, are both very important.  In many ways, this book is similar to &quot;The Appearance of Impropriety:  How the Ethics Wars Have Undermined American Government, Business and Society,&quot; but although this book is somewhat less accessible to general readers it is certainly stronger from a social-science standpoint.  An excellent book, well worth reading for anyone interested in why repeated efforts to stamp out political corruption have borne such mixed (at best) results.	1998-07-30

But there's the problem (it's not a flaw, because Barnes did it on purpose).  The characters are so damned repulsive that by the end of the book you feel unclean.  Ugh.  And it doesn't help that, in a wholly unadmirable way, it's at core a love story.   It's truly a masterpiece in terms of craft, but it's not beach reading.  At least, not if you want to enjoy the beach.	1998-07-27

Following the advice in this book, which I read years ago when it first came out, saved my life.  The book is well-organized for quick recall in an emergency:  sections are titled &quot;too fast&quot; (car crash, plane crash, etc.), &quot;too dry&quot; (desert), etc.  That's what you're thinking when you're in trouble!  I've long since lost my copy of this book and was hoping to order another.  PUBLISHERS:  Reissue this!	1998-07-25

It's not availability of guns -- guns were much *more* available fifty years ago, yet teen school killers were unknown!   As Grossman points out, even soldiers who are given guns and ordered to kill find it difficult.  To make it easier for them, the military have developed various programs of conditioning and desensitization to overcome their inborn human resistance to killing fellow humans.   Sadly, Grossman points out, we have replicated these programs almost exactly in violent movies and videogames, causing inhibitions against killing to be much lower among civilians than they used to be.  Grossman's work should be at the center of discussion regarding violence in contemporary society.	1998-07-25

I've always liked Drake, but his collaboration with Eric Flint seems a good one.  The writing and characterization are excellent, the pace is good, and -- as a longtime Belisarius fan -- the setting, etc. quite fascinating. Highly recommended.	1998-07-21

Though I am pro-choice, the book does a great service in humanizing the anti-abortion forces and in presenting them as three-dimensional characters, not media stereotypes.  As Joel Dyer's Harvest of Rage did (less well) for the militia movement, this book reminds readers that there are real people on both sides of the issue, and that progress is unlikely unless their complexity is taken into account.   The journalism is thorough, the writing is clear and graceful, and the story is compelling.  An excellent and insightful treatment.	1998-07-20
