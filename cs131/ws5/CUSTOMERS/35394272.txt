Robert Winter is a perceptive scholar of Victoriana and arts and crafts, but he sensibly left modernism to his collaborator, the late David Gebhard. Now he has attempted to do it all, by providing entries on key buildings of the 1990s that he neither likes nor understands, and the result is embarrassing. Gehry, Maltzan, Mayne, Moss, Pei, and Yazdani will be surprised to find themselves bundled together under the label \\"Neo-Expressionism (Postmodernism).\\" Disney Hall, which is pictured on the cover, is described in terms of what happened ten years ago (plus cloddish public reactions to the first pictures of the model); there's not a sentence on the completed building. Other adventurous work is dismissed as \\"very strange.\\" A long-winded entry on the Getty reads like a chatty letter to a friend; most are absurdly brief. The revisions add almost nothing, and are woefully incomplete; the publisher is guilty of gross negligence for not wielding an editorial pencil. Earlier selections have been edited, but the William Cameron Menzies house in Beverly Hills is still there, even though it was demolished three editions ago, along with Gehry's Venice restaurant, Rebecca's. The original 97 percent of the guide remains invaluable and engaging. (Michael Webb is the book reviewer for LA Architect magazine.)	2004-04-17

About a tenth of those are illustrated in nine thematic sections. Many are icons, but there are a few surprises, especially among recent acquisitions, where the inventive use of materials supplants functional beauty. Paola Antonelli, MoMA Curator of Architecture and Design, describes the collection as presenting a history of ideas and realizing a part of Alfred Barr's dream of a unity of the arts. She explains how the old selection criteria of truth and beauty have changed while retaining some of their old authority.

Denmark's leading architect designed this hotel-terminal in 1960 as the flagship of SAS, a major patron of progressive design, when air travel was still a civilized experience for a fortunate few. Fabrics, lighting, and furniture-most famously the Egg, Swan, and Drop chairs-even the stainless steel flatware and door handles were custom designed by Jacobsen for the hotel. Everything but the one room (which rents for about $575 a night) and the spiral stair in the lobby has now been changed. Sheridan, a New York architect, employs a wealth of period photos and sketches to recreate every facet of the original and places it in the context of Jacobsen's earlier work.

Chipperfield-like John Pawson, for whom he once worked-is a maestro of luxurious minimalism, a perfectionist who demands polish and precision in every detail and on every surface. When he doesn't get it, he walks away: hence the omission of the Bryant Park Hotel in New York-a refined remodel of Raymond Hood's classic American Radiator Building-in which the client didn't stay the course. The thirty buildings and projects, plus furniture and ceramics, that he has anointed are arranged alphabetically to counter any suspicion of linear development. One finds a surprising diversity of invention. Curves sneak in, as they never do in Pawson's relentlessly rectilinear world, and Chipperfield's vacation house in Spain has a checkerboard façade. There are nods to Mies and Le Corbusier, to the English vernacular and to classicism-notably in his work on Museum Island in Berlin.

Bias aside, I found this to be the standout in a crowded field of books proclaiming that small is beautiful, even as many Americans are pigging out. Ours is an age of obscene excess, and it's refreshing to see how well one can live in a space half as large as mine, and a small fraction the size of mega mansions shoehorned into the Westside.

Nobody who saw the structural frame going up on Grand Avenue will forget its raw beauty, but most of the bones were covered in a shimmering skin a year before the hall opened. Garcetti, better known as the former DA of Los Angeles County, has captured the physicality of the work in his photos, and in the words of the people who did it. Their pride and solidarity are inspiring. (Michael Webb is the book reviewer for LA Architect magazine.)	2003-04-11

She spent eight years on research and layout--driving, photographing, and analyzing the shifts in style over the 35-year heyday of what was once America's most celebrated artery. It celebrates a vanished era of local sign makers who had pride of craft and a responsiveness to location, in contrast to the standardization of corporate logos. Mahar's analysis of geometry and iconography is fascinating. (Michael Webb is the book reviewer for LA Architect magazine.)	2003-04-11

Sadly, the only manufactured housing to win wide acceptance was the trailer; architect-designed prototypes seldom left the boards. Arieff, who is senior editor of Dwell magazine, hopes that a new generation of architects may succeed where their forebears failed. She documents over 30 industrialized building projects, mostly from Europe, that combine practicality with design excellence. Sadly, it remains true that people who will happily buy one of a fleet of  identical cars, become emotional and irrational when choosing their home.

There, the concept cars are at rest and can't be touched; here they emerge suggestively from shadows, stretch, and zoom off in a blur of light.

If he hadn't won the attention of Julius Shulman--as a photographer and client--he would probably be forgotten, so few are the surviving traces of his modest mid-century output. When he died, in 1988, poor and embittered, few took note. This self-inflicted failure (Soriano alienated Entenza, Eichler and several other key clients) challenged Wolfgang Wagener, an architect who practices here and in Germany, to reevaluate his achievement and develop a complete list of buildings and projects.

One pities anyone whose idea of domestic bliss is a Ramada Inn. This catalogue of an exhibition running through March 2 at the Cooper-Hewitt in New York, celebrates a fresh approach that puts chic ahead of comfort, and makes every guest realize she isn't in Kansas anymore. It intersperses W Hotels and the properties of Ian Schraeger and Andre Balasz with blue-sky projects that--if realized--might make you wish you had stayed home. That's especially true of one that was built--Jean Nouvel's hotel in Lucerne--where every ceiling is silkscreened with a movie still that could inspire nightmares. Maybe that Ramada wasn't so bad, after all. (Michael Webb is the book reviewer for LA Architect magazine.)	2003-03-14

The architecture of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates demonstrates that stone can be used inventively and convincingly in buildings that address present needs and budgets.

His houses-of raw steel or rammed earth-respond to the brutal beauty and intense light of the Sonoran desert, and, like Glenn Murcutt, he uses the simplest materials and forms to satisfy all the senses. In Pallasmaa's eloquent tribute and the superb color photos, you can feel the heat of the desert wind, run your hand over a rugged wall, and watch the earth change color as the sun sinks beneath the mountains.	2002-10-23

Noel provides an encyclopedic 600 pages of plans, photos, and commentary on boom towns-from those that have faded to those, like Denver, that have exploded.

His long association with Joseph Eichler and other suburban builders prevented him from being taken as seriously as more rigorous and rebellious peers. Modern architecture is supposed to be challenging; Jones made it look easy. However, a drive around Crestwood Hills in West LA, and a close examination of the model houses he and others designed for that enlightened housing association, engender a new respect. Pragmatic, inventive, and humane, Jones bridged the chasm between high art and popular taste, emphasizing practicality over ideology. Buckner has hands-on experience, having restored four Jones houses, and one wishes she had expanded her brief introduction to the architect's career to communicate her personal enthusiasm for his unshowy brilliance. In every other way, this is an admirable survey of 65 key projects, illustrated with vintage black and white photos, drawings and plans.	2002-10-23

There he designed the celebrated Penguin Pool and other enlightened zoo buildings (animals were more ready to embrace progressive ideas than humans), the controversial Highpoint apartment blocks, a model health center, and some exemplary social housing.<br />Idealistic and rational, Lubetkin was anything but dourÑthough he was often constrained by meager municipal budgets. Few architects matched his brilliance in turning staircases into spatial adventures, or have used ramps as well as he did for the penguins. And few would have had the wit to respond to public criticism of austerity in the first Highpoint as he did by placing Greek caryatids under the entry canopy of the second block, thus enraging his humorless peers. Lubetkin was one of many brilliant east European migrs who brought civilization to the backward West, and he is aptly celebrated here in a spirited text, a foreword by Richard Meier, and handsome new photographs.	2002-08-28
