Not _children's_ fiction, but fiction in general. Anyone who can't enjoy greatly a Roald Dahl book is simply creating reasons not to like it.  This one is often overlooked among his work, with James and the Giant Peach, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator being his best known works. This book is as good and is a bit different from the quirkier humor showcased in those novels. Definitely well worth reading again and again.	2005-09-22

They will use this book as a litmus test for newer authors, newer stories and characters. From first to last there is not a part of this book done at anything less than an excellent level. The wordsmithery, the story structure and the deft execution of turning points in the story would individualy make the story worth reading, together they make the story a rare find.	2005-09-15

This was a great account of the pursuits of Franklin, associates and family during the Revolution in France. It does lean towards excessive French sentiment, i say excessive only because while we did owe the French (and others) our independence, we're repaid the dept twice since. It would be nice to see the author do a series that explored some of the other figures of the erar, and not just the obligatory Washington and Jefferson books, but the second president, his son and Jefferson's cousin definitely need their time in the sun. Recommended to the history enthusiast and the novice.	2005-09-04

I found this take on the training of a covert ops soldier very interesting. The book is start to finish a look at the world through the eyes of a character that i was very near to writing off as a worthless, arrogant twit and putting the book down. I'm glad i didn't the book does take some wrenching twists, but it is all part of a tightly written story that is more than it first appears and not your run of the mill sciffy adventure tale. Dark, bleak even but well worth the read.	2005-09-04

This book with its continuous stream of world shaking personal stories shows why those critics are so full of hot air. It covers everything from the recoded of the 761st tank unit, which has a combat recoded that will likely never be eclipsed, to the stories of people at Pearl Harbor, people who lived through the nearly forgotten \\"Zoot Suit Riots\\" and more. Recommended reading for everyone. It's easy to read, but impossible to forget.	2005-05-09

This is an account of the Congo's history. It covers in quite vivid detail the lives of the players and the played who went into the capture of, the taking of, and the liberation of the Congo. King Leopold 2 of Belgium, several Americans, and a certian explorer whose reputation was well entwined with this privately owned colony. Not for those with weak stomachs. In my opinion this proves that Leopold was perhaps the greatest conartist and despot of his time.	2005-03-11

This may just be the best book I've read this year, and is now firmly entrenched in my top ten. I was for some reason surprised to like this better than the first book in the series, which was possibly the best book of the year when it came out. How it never won either a Hugo or Nebula is beyond me, any one who reads either of these books is guaranteed to be drawn in by one of the richest and best crafted worlds I've ever seen. This book pick up not long after the first with Maria and husband heading off to the back of beyond, Erik and Manfred traveling, and Benito getting into even more trouble. This book has all of the strengths of the first and all the rough edges polished off by familiarity.	2003-12-22

I had this book preordered when it came out, and tore through it the night and early morning I got it. Lackey and Edgehill get better and better each time they work together. Eric has left behind him occasionally obnoxious whining and self pity, His brother has managed to figure out his parents are scum, with out going over the edge into all people are scum. The other characters are rich, and full, even the elves seem more real in this book. I cant wait for the next one.	2003-10-08

This book balanced the tech and the politics very well. Many of the things long predicted by various online fans came in to being but the book was hardly predictable. For a book approaching ponderous in size, it kept the pace moving along pretty well and while there were only a two or three characters that emerged as new names in this one we did get to see quite a few old friends.	2003-01-12

After reading this book, which is an emotional roller coaster that will have you grinding your teeth, laughing, screaming, wincing in sympathy and just counting the seconds before you get to watch the charaters realize they've walked off the cliff with out noticing. It will leave you thoroughly glad Lois (delightfully evil woman that she is) isn't in charge of your love life.

This book deserves one. Not often am I completely taken in by a book for more than a few chapters, this one had me hooked from about page four and didn't let go. Very, very rarely do books get much of an overt reaction from, this one did. The appalling range of emotional reactions Lois is able to elicit from the reader are well represented in any of her books, in this one she makes you run the gauntlet, at least twice. If you have yet to read this book plan not to be doing anything for at least a few hours longer than it takes to read the book, it will leave you feeling spent.	2003-01-10

This woman writes what is for money the best fiction anywhere and yet I walk into bookstores or mention her to people and get blank stares. She should be a household name by now and this book proves it again, as if the Hugo's and Nebulas weren't enough proof of her Gift for the Craft of writing. This book is filled with the awe inspiring wit anyone who's a fan of hers (and her characters) have come to relish. Miles is back, and on his honeymoon when duty calls (actually Gregor sent a courier) and he has to make a stop at an out of the way place Lois fans have heard of but not seen before. Much to the surprise of Miles and the delight of me, we run into an old associate of Miles, and a few old enemies as well, or are they new ones.... I really loved this book and i was very tempted to give it five stars but as a posted on a message board it wasn't long enough (and they never are).... cheers	2002-05-29

I'm glad I got this one. Linden Rathan is a pretty decent guy who's spent a long time lonely, a very long time, over six hundred years. Linden is one of the legendary peace makers and lawgivers a Dragonlord a man whose soul was spilt in half and twinned with half a dragons soul. He's waiting for the other half of his soul to be born. He and two fellow Dragonlords have been dispatched to settle a regency debate that looks like it could last long enough for the young prince to take the throne on his own. Then things get interesting.... One of the most amazing things about this high quality book is, well the high quality, this is her first book.	2002-05-29

Yep, that was my reaction when I first heard of the girth of this book. I tend to believe that if you can't write a good story under 600 pages or a very little bit more, you can't write a good story period. I stopped picking up any book over 600 pages by authors I didn't already like years ago. And even though I really like the work of Lackey, Flint, and Freer, it did take me a few weeks to go get it and then read it. I read it in about two and a half days, a better pace than many a book half it's length. The characters are all worth reading about no matter who you fell most drawn to. The world is a little harder to adjust to than the run of the mill (DRECK!!) stuff that is usually based on northern European mythology were English is the norm and German and French are thrown in for 'culture' and 'scope'. Not only a good read but it has put any follow on's into the top portion of my must buy list.	2002-05-29

This is a new world with a new star for Lois. He's a real live genuine grown up with a very different take on the world than Miles. In this world the Gods (four or five depending on where you live) are pretty active, and they don't always get along. Caz is one of the best characters I've read in a long time. He has an interesting world to get into 'interesting times' in. His friends and enemies in this world are all the three dimensional people (not characters) that Lois fans have some to expect.  This is one of my two fave books by Lois, the other being Mirror Dance. I'm not going to spoil it by telling you anything other than keep reading some people I know found the first few chapters a little slow, I didn't and I don't know anyone who didn't like the book a lot.	2002-05-29
