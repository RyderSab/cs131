It was like listening to a book report rather than hearing an uplifting novel. The characters never were developed and I was often confused as to who they were and what they were doing. I know I'll need to read the book now, but I would have loved to listened to the story as well.	2005-10-11

But the reader knows it won't be much of a romance if she isn't able to work through those feelings, find a new man, and have to face the one who left her behind. If at first Bell's novel seems predictable, know that it would be less satifying if things worked out any other way. This really was one of the best LDS novels I've read. I cared about the characters and looked forward to how it all worked out in the end. If you listen to the book on tape, know that the way the reader rushes through the first side of tape 1 is corrected by the second side and the novel becomes a pleasant listen while traveling in the car or doing housework at home.	2005-09-13

The author had her characters smiling or laughing all the time, and the reader interpreted this to mean she should read entire passages as if they were laughing the words. Had Allen edited for word repetition more carefully and watched for redundancy in thought, she would have had a better book overall, and I don't think the reader would have over-used her laugh. I liked the way the plot all came together in the end, but if I had been reading a hardcopy rather than listening to a tape, I know I would have had to read with a red editing pen in hand.	2005-08-25

An unexpected invitation from Aunt Euterpe brings Rosie, Lottie, and Buster Beckett on their way from rural Illinois to Chicago and the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition fair. Of course, they didn't plan on Granddad using Mama's ticket to join them and him bringing along his dog, Tip. Poor Aunt Euterpe, still in mourning after the loss of her elderly husband four years ago, she doesn't know what to do when they arrive and her household staff quits. Soon Granddad has everybody off to the fair, ready to visit the midway attractions including Little Egypt, Lillian Russell, and the Ferris wheel that holds nearly as many people per seat as a boxcar. Aunt Euterpe knows her chances of being part of the Chicago society circle are ruined, even before Granddad takes them to Buffalo Bill's Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders show.	2002-11-04

Jack and Ashley Landon love to travel with their mother, a wildlife veterinarian, who is often called to solve animal mysteries, and their father, who hopes to have a career as a photographer. This time they are on their way to Acadia National Park in Maine to investigate why the marine animals are beaching. But Jack and Ashley have a problem. Bindy Callister, the 14- year-old temporary foster child who has just come to live with the Landon family. Bindy is a liar, or at least Jack thinks so. She claims to know the reason for the animal behavior, and the kids find her near a beached baby whale. Bindy slips away during the rescue operation, determined to prove she know why this is happening, and Jack and Ashley get themselves in deeper than they planned for.The mystery is fascinating reading and an educational experience all rolled into one. I think it's the best one yet in this series for upper elementary or older readers. The mother/daughter author team never fail to teach about science, geography, and human behavior.	2002-11-04

Ann Cannon brings to the national market the tender story of twelve-year-old Charlotte, a Welsh immigrant who crossed America with a handcart company. Along the Mormon trail, Charlotte volunteers to care for the baby daughter of a woman who has died. At first, she is proud of herself, believing she has shown the adults that she is nearly a woman. But she soon realizes how difficult a task she has undertaken. Charlotte is frustrated by the baby's cries, her own lack of sleep, and not being able to spend the time she would like with John, who she wants to see her as more than a child. Eventually she can stand it no longer and she leaves the baby sleeping beneath the handcart on a rest stop, going on a walk with John instead of taking care of her obligation. When she returns, the baby is gone. Charlotte searches frantically, but finds the infant Charlotte has named Rose being cared for by Catherine Jones, a strange woman with a marked scar on her face. This coming of age novel demonstrates that the feelings that come into the hearts of adolescents remain the same through all generations. Read this one with a box of tissues handy.	2002-11-04

When Seabrig, the twin he is raising, loses a hand in a swimming accident, Corgan can't overcome the terrible feeling that Sharla's twin, Brigand, did it on purpose.

When the boys are forced to join Hitler's youth group, they learn about the ruthless and violent ways of the Nazis and begin to formulate a plan to spread the truth among the German people.

No matter your age, you can probably remember a time (or ten, or twenty) when you were embarrassed by your mother. Her words, dress, actions all combined to humilitate you in front or your friends, or worst of all, the love of your life. No matter what you tried to do to stop her, Mom only became more embarrassing by the minute and you thought you'd never be able to face the world again. Twelve-year-old Laura Stephan feels the same way and keeps a list of all the things she would like to change about her mother. But her mom doesn't mean to be embarrassing. She just wants to stay good friends with the daughter she loves. She'd do anything to keep Laura happy, but her best efforts all seem to be wrong. How could Mom have known Dad would hurt his neck while break-dancing at Laura's party? So what if Mom and Christian talked about Laura behind her back? Why should Laura be concerned that Mom has a modeling job while several months pregnant? Will the birth of the baby make things better or worse? Carol Lynch Williams take a humorous look at mother/daughter relationships that are cross-generational. A great read for a mother/daughter book club, a pre-teen who feels embarrassed by her own mother, or a mother who wants to understand her emotion-packed daughter a little bit better.	2002-05-06

I've read several of the Oprah selections and only liked two of them, so I was leery of giving another one a try. I'd heard some feedback previously to The Poisonwood Bible and had wanted to read it anyway, so I used that as  an excuse to pick this one up.
