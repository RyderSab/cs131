I was searching by local library and I found this book. And am I glad I did. It is an amazing book with an edge to it. <br /> <br />Anyway, this book is about Harley. She is a girl that lives with her abusive dad and cold-hearted mother with 2 other siblings. When Harley is up in her attic hide-away, to get away from her parents and all of their secrets, she finds a toy clown among the other boxes of stuff, but something is special about the stupid toy. Inside the card it says, \\"Papa loves you forever and a day\\" in handwriting that's not her father's. As Harley searches for answers she finds the wrong social crowd, her grades drop, and she ditches her best friend. But Harley knows that her parents aren't really her parents, and if it takes everything to find them, she'll do it. Even as she spirals downward to a point where only her art can comfort her, Harley is sure that if they're is the real truth out there, she will find it. <br /> <br />I really liked the book. It had such a likeable character, Harley, with her search to find her real parents. She has such likeability about her that she makes the book. Not only does she make some mistakes, but she also finds something out all on her own. Which to me, shows that she can do anything, or that we all can. <br />	2005-07-15

Who knows why? <br /> <br />Anyway, the book it about Martyn Pig and what happen late one night. I know, charming name, really. He's a boy that loves a good murder mystery and likes everything neat and clean. Any-woo, his mom left him and his father a long time ago and pretty much after that, his father has been a drunk, an abusive, rude, uncaring drunk. Martyn has ignored it for a long time and has just dealt with it, but when he accidentally kills his father things get hard and scary quick. One of his friends, Alex, ends up finding out and then so does her stupid boyfriend, Dean. Dean finds a way to black mail Martyn for his father's money, but Martyn isn't stupid. He thinks of a plan, and almost thinks it works. But it doesn't because someone he thought was his friend betrays him, Alex. Through out this book Martyn shows his feelings towards Alex but with her betraying him, he has to think of a new plan and quickly. Even without his best friends at his side. <br /> <br />I really loved this book and I knew nothing about this book until I saw it at my local library. I'd never even heard of the author, but I'm glad I did seek it out. It was an amazing story with a different look on life. I thought it was interesting to life Martyn life through out this time. I loved it. <br />	2005-07-14

I was introduced to this book from the title and the author, which I have read other things by. It was an amazing book written in such grace, it gave me the shivers. <br /> <br />This book is about Ruby and her hardship of her mother dying. Now, any death, especially you mother's, is very hard, but Ruby then had to move to sunny LA with her famous, jerk dad. As Ruby tried to hold on to her old life by writing letter to her best friend, her boyfriend, and her dead mother, she seems to be sinking quickly in her new life situation. As Ruby tries to push her father farther and farther away she realizes something about him that sheds a new light on her Hollywood father. Ruby even finds something horrible about her best friend and her boyfriend, something that just about breaks her to pieces. You can watch Ruby go through a tough time, as it seems that the people around her seem to be helping in the worst.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book because of many reasons. Not only was it fast moving, which I love, but also the characters tell everything about themselves, yet keeping themselves hidden. I think Sonya Sones just has an amazing talent and another amazing hit on her hands. I loved it! <br />	2005-07-13

I loved the intensity and it's realistic characters. What would this story do without Ashley, the prettiest girl in school? And Isabelle. She is an amazing character that I can totally relate to and I even think that I am like her in many ways. <br /> <br />Anyway, this book is about Isabelle. She is a 13-year-old girl that is suffering from family problems. Her dad has died and all her mother wants to do now days in cry at night and act like everything is \\"fine\\". When her sister April (AKA Ape Face) finds Isabelle hovered over the bathroom's toilet forcing herself to throw up, she tells her mother. Her mother then forces her to Group Therapy for girls that are bulimic. Isabelle meets great problems in this book. She thinks she's ugly and fat. But when the prettiest girl in her school comes into those Group doors, she knows that, how the mighty have fallen. Her first thought is, 'Hey, Ashley is skinny and perfect and has everything in life. She has a mom AND a dad with really cool teenage brothers.' Isabelle might be right about a few things, but she is not perfect and neither is her family. Through out Group people let out their feelings instead of throwing up. Isabelle becomes friends with Ash and finds that she throws up even more then she, herself, does.  <br /> <br />Their friendship is fine until, I think, Isabelle realizes that she doesn't want to throw up her feelings. She is tired of hearing her mother cry at night, so she does something about it. She stops. And that's the best thing she could of done. Aside from being a friend to Ashley when she really needed one. <br /> <br />Overall, I loved this book. A friend gave me this book and I'm happy I read it. The image these girls where trying to get had nothing to do with their weight or their looks, but of their fears and their feelings. Anyway, I loved it, and thank you Natasha Friend for this amazing book and your first novel. I loved it. <br />	2005-07-01

It was so real and true that I felt that I was reading her horrible, heart-wrenching story even though she wanted it to be a secret. This was a true story, and I am amazed at this story. <br /> <br />Anyway, this is a book about a girl and her story with drugs. She goes in and out of love with a boy and because of his actions she turns to drugs. The 1st time she runs away she goes with a friend and they move into a very dumpy apartment and soon open a boutique. A whole latta mess happens and she soon finds herself back home, and then out in the real world again. Here, she sleeps around to get what's she needs, and normally sleeps in a park with other drugies. People are always getting hurt in ways, and she is soon losing her mind. She calls home and tries to make things work. She even finds the perfect guy, which stays by her side until the end. Unfortunately, while baby-sitting someone hides drugs in the peanuts she was supposedly eating. She then loses her mind. Thinking that worms, maggots, and larva are eating her flesh, slowly. She goes into a mental hospital and there, she meets some interesting people with deep stories, almost as deep as Alice's.  <br /> <br />The end of this story is very sad. I say this because she was fine, perfectly normal, and then something happened or she just snapped. Anyway, this book is very deep and disturbing in places. Please, be ready when you read this book because there is something that really is hard to sink in about this book. Anyway, I loved this book in all its intensity and I thank Anonymous for giving this book to the public to read and learn from. <br />	2005-06-21

I don't live in Great Britain, but in the states, so reading something from another country is always interesting for me. <br /> <br />This book it about a 15-year-old boy named Martin. He has what an average teenager has: a girlfriend, a gang, family, and good looks. Things change when he goes to DANCEMANIA and shows of his good dance moves in the club. Walking home he meets up with a boy named Peter. Peter asks him and his friends if they wanna go for a ride. Martin excepts because Peter use to go to his school so he sort of trusts him. He also gets his friend, Mark, to come along for the ride, but Matthew stays behind, knowing that nothing good will come out if the joy ride. <br /> <br />Martin soon finds himself in a hospital with sever burns to his hands and face because the driver of the car ran a red light, running away from the cops. Martin then finds that his face is messed up bad. He then stays in the hospital for almost a month because of his badly burned face. <br /> <br />This book is really about the changes of life. In this case, Martin must deal with his disfigured face and the way the public, his friends, and even his girlfriend treat him. Martin faces ups and downs, but realizes that being here, with his family and his REAL friends, is better then looks and winning. <br /> <br />I loved this book; so 2 thumps up to Benjamin Zephaniah for this amazing story about teen triumph and lose. This was an amazing book that was written in the way that you could just relate. <br />	2005-06-13

I'm glad I picked this book up because it was a well-told story about a girl that happened to be a misunderstood orphan.  <br /> <br />This book is about a 16-year-old girl that has gone from foster home to foster home because of her behavior. She then comes upon THE LAST CHANCE TAXACO where she has one more chance to straighten up her act before she ends up in a place where she won't get out until her 18th birthday, Eat-Their-Young-Island. Lucy is the type of person that pushes people away because she thinks she can't trust them, but then she gets into a fight with a pretty-boy jock who soon becomes her partner in picking up trash. Their relationship is a little rocky, but it soon picks up when she stops pushing him away. She also makes enemies. One is Joy, another girl at THE LAST CHANCE TEXACO, who just thinks that she can get anything she wants when she wants it.  <br /> <br />Soon, Lucy and her boyfriend, the pretty-boy jock, have a case on their hands with the neighborhood car fires. And the cops think the Kindle Home kids have done it. Lucy tries to find the arsonist, and gets help from unexpected people. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed this book with its quick wit and amazing characters. Lucy is a headstrong girl that is so dependant, that she pushes people away so easily, she doesn't even realize it. I also loved this book for its realistic twist. Nothing was left to chance, and I like that about a book. <br />	2005-06-13

At first I thought this book was mainly about a teenage girl, but I soon realized it was about a teenage boy. (I mean look at the cover. Does it love like a book about a guy?) <br /> <br />Anyway, this book is about John/Giovanni and his love to write. In this case, he got acquainted with Marisol because he writes a zine called Bananafish. He meets her because he think she is an amazing author and she sounds just like him, a type of person he could be friends with because the only friend he really has he doesn't even like.  <br /> <br />Soon, he becomes friends with Marisol and becomes a  part of her lifestyle. But soon, John's father makes a huge mistake. Assuming that when Marisol comes over to spend the night, and he finds her pants over the shower curtain, he thinks that they were doing something that never happened and that their more then friends. John then realizes his real grief about his mother and father with their divorce. He sees that his mother never touches him since her divorce with his father 6 years ago. No hugging, kissing, or even a slight bump in the shoulder. He soon writes a letter to both of his parents stating what he feels.  <br /> <br />That is what this book is about. Love and how people handle it. And I loved this book and read it with ease. It is very original with its characters and the way they carry themselves (literally). Love is hard, but with this book we see an unlikely situation with a gay young women and a straight guy falling hard for the wrong girl.   <br />	2005-06-08

I really don't know for sure, but I'm going to try because this is a book that needs not to be unnoticed.    This book is about the All American football player, the girl that feels out of place because she is bi-racial, the Floater that was once nothing but worked himself up to be what he is now, and the \\"Freek\\", that has the idea the a gun might be the way to solve his problems and listens to ATTAAK often. This book takes place on the one-year anniversary of the shooting, and killing, of Jake, once a student in these characters' school. The book deals with a lot of things that teenagers have to go through daily. Bullies, sex, guns, and football are all here in this book that are real problems of life.     In this story these characters really have nothing to do with each other except that the Floater and the \\"Freek\\" like Tisha, the only girl in the story. This all changes when the Colonel finds out that his son, the All American teenager Ryan, gets charged with sexual harassment. The Colonel then comes to the principal with a knife, fighting for his son's future. These characters also have their secrets. Ryan mostly, with his past by the horrible way of being treated by the Colonel.     This book really touched me. It felt all the things that these amazing characters went threw. Love. Hate. Fear. Passion. Hurt. Happiness. And everything else we teenagers are faced with. Thank you Jaime Adoff for writing this amazing book with such grace. I enjoyed it and I hope you do too.	2005-06-06

How amazing is it that Flavia Bujor wrote this book in 6 months when she was 13 years old. I read it in a quick amount of time because I could follow the characters and their stories with ease.     This book is about three girls, Opal, Jade, and Amber, and their destiny to save the good in the world. At first, these are three very different people from very different aspects of life. Then, they are told they must leave their homes and go meet 2 other girls to fulfill their destiny, but as enemies. They meet, and start their risky journey to a person that well help them find their way, Oonagh. During their journey they learn that they are very different from one another.     As these girls embark on their journey at 14 years old, they are also keeping a sick girl is present time, Paris, alive. Along their journey one almost finds Death, but Death is on strike so she lives to continue her journey. Love also strikes two of these young girls' hearts in an uncertain time. Yet, in this story, love and faith is the one thing that keeps these three girls, and everyone else in the story, together, to fight the Darkness and The Council together.    I praise Flavia Bujor for this amazing novel. She wrote this book with such grace and amazing characters at such a young age. I think she is an amazing author and her next novel should be as amazing as this one had been!	2005-05-31

Now, I'm normally not a huge fan of Mystery, but this book was an exception.  <br /> <br />This book is a mystery about a girl, Alice, and her father's past. Her father's brother was killed because he was stealing info for another man. Even since Alice's father's uncle had died her father had tried to find the killer. Even from the day of the murder Alice's father had know that his \\"twin\\" had not died because he had been run over like the police were lead to believe. So, her father writes a type of biography (or autobiography?) about his past and plans to place it on the Internet to track down the guy. Unfortunately, her father is murdered before he can do just this. And Alice, his very own daughter, is framed for the murder.  <br /> <br />I loved this book because it really showed how nice some people could be at times. I mean, all of these people helped Alice when she was running away from her mother because of the murder, and I thought that was pretty cool. Anyway, Caroline B. Conney has written many Mystery books so please check 'em out because they're really good. They have to be coming from a person who normally hated Mystery! <br />	2005-05-23

It was a little slow moving, but it still caught my interest because of the overall moral.     This book is about a freshmen girl in high school, Melinda. She was the average teenager, but during an at-the-end-of-summer party something horrible happened. Even though something bad had happened to Melinda, people wouldn't talk to her and made her feel bad for calling the cops. They did this because Melinda never told anyone. She kept this big secret to herself, and lost all of her friends over calling the cops. Through out this story Melinda deals with kids that don't understand, and an Art project in which she must draw a real tree. She does make some friends and even finds a hid-away in a janitor's closet. But overall, she gets through a horrible experience in her life.     I really enjoyed this book. I loved the realness of a summer ending party. Melinda had a big secret that she kept hidden. I still don't know why she did keep it hidden, but for some reason she must have thought that she was responsible for what had happened. Melinda was a character I could relate to, and maybe this is why I loved this book so much. 2 thumps-up to Laurie Halse Anderson. I loved this book, and I hope you do too.	2005-05-20

I'm afraid I'll turn you away from one of the best books I've read in a very long time. Crank is so real, yet intense, that I loved it until the very last page.    Anyway, this book is about a girl, Kristina (or Bree because of the 'monster'), and her spending time at her long-lost dad, which changed her life forever. First, she meets the perfect guy at her dad's job at a bowling place. Yeah, he's perfect except for the whole drug thing. Then, of course, she must leave her father's and her source of 'crank', Buddy, the love of her life. When she gets home she finds new sources for the 'monster'. She gets it from a bad boy, Chase, and a perfect-jock-type-guy, Brendon. For the next couple of months a lot of stuff happens, but I won't tell you that because that would be mean and tell you the whole story line. I well say that she does some crazy stuff when high on the 'monster', and I am sorry for everyone that has made this decision in his or her life, and then have to go though what this character had to go through.     Overall, I loved this book. I'm really sorry if I turned you away from this book because I didn't mean to. I loved this book, and it has deep meaning to me. Crank is a monster and I hope this story tells you to never do it, ever. Or this could situation happen to you.	2005-05-08

It had one of the best morals a book could give, don't be anyone's Honey, Baby, Sweetheart. And in this book, that exactly what Ruby, the main character, didn't do.    This book was about a girl, Ruby, and her journey of loving a 'bad' boy, Travis. She found him exciting, and the best kisser ever. Ruby had seen her mother go in and out of love with her father so many times that it was a normal routine. She loved Travis' motorcycle and everything about him, except the stealing. And when he steals from the store where she works she has given up hope on Travis and maybe even love. I think she re-discovers it when the 'Casserole' Queens steal a woman out of a home to be with the true man that she loves.     I love this book, even though it didn't top Deb's first book, The Queen of Everything. I give her a high praise for this book. I loved everything about it. The characters, theme, and definitely the plot were all well written! I enjoyed this book, and I hope you do to!	2005-05-06

Everyone has heard of the story about the older sister getting married, and the younger one getting stuck with second-hand stuff, such as boyfriends, and parents. Even though I could predict what was going to happen, but it was still a great twist to the average story.     That Summer is about a girl named Haven dealing with to many problems at once. Her parents have just split 2 years ago because her father was fooling around with the \\"Weather Pet\\", and now both her sister and her dad are getting married. Haven gets unexpected visits from Ashley's old boyfriend, Sumner, and remembers when everything was perfect. Her parents were together and her sister was fun and happy. Now Haven feels lonely, and isn't quiet sure what she feels when her father spills his big news. Haven has to stop and think, what's more important, the fun past or the uncertain future?    I personally loved this book. It didn't have the normal moral that Dessen has, which normally has something to do with guys. Dessen shows Haven's real side and her fears of the future, and the hopes of everything becoming the same (people that have gone throw divorces and weddings know that will never happen). Anyway, love ya Sarah Dessen. You sure know how to write a book! Loved it!	2005-04-27

It had suspense, but also reality that I have to have in a book to keep my attention.  <br /> <br />This book is about a girl, Cici, spending her summers up at her grandmother's and step-gtandfather's cottege. She has always been looked at as a little kid, but after a summer of not being there she really wanted to look older in front of Jack. :) <br />She soon finds out that during the summer that she was away from Crystal Lake, a girl got murrdered. Someone she grew-up with. Someone that was free spirited and young got killed in one night that something went very badly. Even though this girl that got murdered was a pain, she was still a person that she knew. Her family told her that the girl got strangeled by her tacky necklaces, and Cici thinks that she can find the killer that isn't Jack cool older borther.  <br /> <br />Through out the story she tries to find the killer with the help of her friend, Jack. She knows that Brody, Jack's brother, isn't gulity so she is going to find that right guy. Soon, she gets herslf in a hole latta trouble, but with Jack stinking up for her she gets through it.  <br /> <br />I relly enjoyed this book. Jack and Cici were great charcters and were realistic enough for me to believe that they had a real friendship.

Feeling real emotion such as fear, hurt, and confusion.  <br /> <br />The summary of the book is quit simple. A 16 year old boy is convicted with felony murder, which means he himself did not kill the victim, but he was helpful to the murder. From the start of the book I thought he was inecent because he was fearful of what was going to happen to him instead of some of the other young men convicted with murder which felt nothing. Anyway, this story is realy a journey in life. Yes, most of the time this does not happen to everyone, but it is very common.  <br /> <br />I wish you would read this book and discover the real meaning if fear and strength. I loved it, and I give Wlater Dean Myers a big congrates with this realistic book.  <br />	2005-04-18

The characters are what really pulled me in. The are so funny, cool, and I just wanted to get to know them even more then the author, Rachel Cohn, would let me.     Overall, this book is about a senior in high school, once again getting to know her boyfriend, Shrimp. Yes, she has a past with being pregnant with hottie Justin's baby. Cyd is just someone trying to find her way before she leaves high school, not to her dismay, and have a life with her boyfriend or maybe not. :) She learns what happens when she makes bad and good choices. Cyd is just a girl, like you and me, being in love and not really knowing how to deal with it.    I give Rachel Cohn a big hug because this book rocked!!

Personally, I didn't enjoy this book at all, but of course I finished it hoping to get a good ending (which I didn't get).     Anyway, this story is about a 13/14 year old girl going through her life in a family that is so unloving, that she gets a boyfriend to make her feel loved or important. She thinks (and we never do get to know her name) that if she makes him, her boyfriend, happy in some ways, then she will become happy too. This boyfriend doesn't last, but she gets another one named Oliver. Now, Oliver is \\"28\\" years old (we soon find out that he is, in fact, 31), and she's 14. Wrong! Rebbacca Ray also leavs the ending very questioning. We didn't learn if she was going to stay with Oliver, or if she was pregnant (just an example!).    Anyway, I didn't like the book because the author, Rebbecca Ray, never described these charcters. All through out this book I had no idea what these people looked like. All she really described was the charcters actions and how they delt with their life situations. I mean, I didn't know wiether this girl, whatever her name was, was tall, short, fat, or skiny. All the author did was play on the charcters actions. I would have like a better visual.     Overall, I thank Ray for trying to make a book with meaning and depth, but Ray was only 16 when she dropped out of school to write the book. Good job, but it needed more.	2005-03-30

To some people this would be a very emotinal book. Many families have to go through this, so it was a good book to read and reilize what some people must go through. I give Sonya Sones two thumps up for this book. I loved it! I even enjoyed the poem format. For being her first, I think she ia a brilliant women! Auesome! <br /> <br />	2005-03-21

The setting takes place in a small Texas town were nothing exciting happens in a 13 year old's, Toby, boring town. (One of the boy's brother is in Vietnam *(*(*) That is until Zachary comes into town with his big self to make a few bucks by people paying to see a 600+ pound boy (Zachary) sit around all day. At first, Toby and his friend, Cal, think he'll stick around for a few days, at the most, and then leave so he'll only a memory. Soon, they find out that Zackary is a really cool person. They treat him nicely and mabye even become friends with him. The relize that life is just a bad, scary place not to have a friend.<br /><br />Overall, I really thought this was a good book. Even though it was about two 13 year old boys, it was still good in my opinion. In this story the charcters really seemed to grow and even cop with losing someone they really love. Loved this book and I hope you guys do to!! It rocked!	2005-03-18

It gave us this girl, Remy, and her heart that is as cold as an ice cub. The author, Dessen, makes this charcter so beilevable that I can't get enough of her situation.  <br /> <br />She has this father, a musican, and she makes a rule never to date musicans because to let you down. Then she breaks this rule by getting involved with Dexter. He is lanky, a musican, and cute and Remy can't seem to stay away even though she knows what he will do to her heart, or won't. Overtime Dexter and Remy get close. She starts to even, mabye, love him. It takes a annoying break-up which leads to an even worse friendship to realize a love that was ment to be. Personally, I think she realizes this outside the Quick Zip watching John Miller, Dexter's friend, and her ex, Dexter, to make a complete foul of themselves while they are drunk. Halarious!!! Good man! <br /> <br />Anyway, I really loved this book. High praises to Sarah Dessen for this auesome book. I loved the realistic charcters and the deepness of this situation Remy gets herself into!! Love this book, please read it!!!	2005-02-28

She stopped being afraid and had a little confidence.  <br /> <br />Overall, I truly loved this book. Everyone can relate and wedge themselves into Colie's joys, pains, and sorrows. High prasies to Sarah Dessen. I love your work. Please, read this book!!!	2005-02-28

It was a little old fashion because it was writen in the 1950's, but it still had the same meaning. <br /> <br />Anyway, this book is about a girl, Jane, and her wanting to meet a boy very much. She keeps telling herself that she will meet this hansome boy thats around 16 and, they will fall madly in love. Well, it does happen for her, but just not in that order. She meets a boy while baby-siting for a little girl. They start to go out, but then he doean't ask her to the first high school dance. She is very hurt, but then he tells her its just one big mistake. Its really just about a girl going through her teenage years.  <br /> <br />Overall, I really enjoyed this book. Great work from Beverly Cleary!!! Two thumbs up!! Read this book!!! <br />	2005-02-28

Exspecally the main charcter, Cyd, because she was so out there and wild and free. I really think she had a good prespective on life and thats one this I loved about this book.  <br /> <br />Anyway, about this ausome book. It starts off by telling us about Cyd and Nancy's (Nancy is Cyd's mother) realtionship and thier ups and downs. It also talks about two other very important charcters: Sugar Pie and Shrimp. Sugar Pie is Cyd Charisse's best friend, but Sugar Pie lives in a home- nuresing home- but is very good for Cyd. She seems to really get her through this whole intire book. This books also is mainly about Cyd getting over this one old boyfriend named Justin. Now, this is what Justin did. First he got Cyd Charisse into drugs and alchol, but then got her pregnat. Cyd knew she couldn't have this baby so she had a abortion that Justin didn't even even go with her too.  <br /> <br />Anyway, now she was a new boyfriend named Shrimp. He seems perfect until she finds out that she also has a crush on his brother, The Java. This leads into a whole lota mess, but I won't tell you all of that because that would just ruin it. Anyway, lets just say Cyd and Shrimp go through some hard times and she goes and visits real-dad-Frank for 3 weeks in New York. Oh yeah, and something happens with her and this guy named Luis, but thats all I'm going to say. I've already said to much. <br /> <br />Overall, I really liked this book. Hugs and Kisses to Rachel Cohn for this ausome book. It is totally \\"unforgettable\\". I loved it! <br /> <br />Jessica	2005-02-02

US	16711283	R2KZ3ORXAJTWSX	0670891223	86018573	Dreamland	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Dreamland, a deep novel	First off, let me say that this was a very real and truthful book. It was so deep that sometimes I'd just have to stop and take some time to let out a big *sigh*, or let a little tear run down my check because this was a very intense book. I'm a total Sarah Dessen fan so when I read this I wan't disapointed.  <br /> <br />Anyway, this story starts out in Caitlin's normal life, her living in the shadows of here sister, the \\"perfect\\" daughter, student, and all around girl. This book is divided into 3 section: Cass (her sister), Rogerson (her abusive boyfriend), and Me (Caitlin).  <br /> <br />In the first section, \\"Cass\\", Caitlin and her family deel with her \\"perfect\\" sister running away, right before her freshmen year in collee at Yale. After this, she becomes even more invisiable in her parents eyes. Her father, by throughing himself into his work, and her mother crying over her long-lost daughter. The next section, \\"Rogerson\\", is about her abusive boyfriend hiting her and abusing her violently. Even though she knows this is happening to her so still loves him and trusts him. She soon becomes scared to talk to anyone but Rogerson. She can't talk to any guys at all because Rogerson might think that the wanna steal her away from him. All the problems that are going on are: her smoking pot, Rogerson beating her and leaving dark brusies and hand prints on her ghostly white skin, and her sister, Cass, leaving her to deal with her ploblems all by herself. The last section, \\"Me\\", is when she is found my her mother being beaten up by Rogerson. Her mother, Margrat, soon sees all of her bruises from the past 6 months. I won't tell you what happens in the end, but let me tell this: its a very emotinial ending. At least fo me anyway.  <br /> <br />I give Sarah Dessen two thumbs up with this book. At some times it was a little depressing, whatching this beautiful, smart, and talented girl get abused by her boyfirnd. At other times I could tell Dessen was discribing this charcterwith as much strength as any girl could put up with in this situation. Love for Rogerson gave her strength to forget the beatings and anger and think of it as a game. I love this book and hope you guys love it to! It had great charcters and was beautifully writen.  <br /> <br />Jessica	2005-01-21

I loved it! <br /> <br />Anyway, this book starts off in the peer conseling room with Jazz and Antonia. They are totally differnt people, as we can tell for sure, right from  the beginning. Tone seems to express herself with her school work and picking up the slack at home. Jazz seems to have a very real perspective on life. Even though Tone (Antonia) describes her as a punker, a druggie, and a gang hanger they become friends by Tone getting into some trouble at home. After this event Tone really needs someone to be her friend for once. They keep talking at peer sessions and Tone fights with herself because of her mom being clinicly depressed. ( I know!! Tough to go through!). Anyway, soon Jazz has quit the one thing se love (piano) and Tone can't let this happen so she soon replaces the peer session with Jazz playing the piano!  <br /> <br />In the end everything works out but I wouln't tell you exactly what happens because that would totally ruin this ausome story. Anyway,I give Julie Anne Peters props for writing this book. Great charcters and situations!! Loved it! I totally recomend this book. Also I love this tittle, Define \\"Normal\\". Thats my question for the day. No my intire life.  <br /> <br />Define \\"Normal\\"!! <br /> <br />Jessica	2005-01-18

I read it in like 2 days and I had a blast reading it. One of my friends recomended it, and she said it was ausome so I trusted her. She was totally right!!! <br /> <br />Anyway, it starts off talking about 3 girls going to a private shool called Ashbury. Their English teacher gives them a assignment were they have to write to the kids at Brokfield high. They kids there are will-destened to like go to jail by the time they turn 18, or juvey. You never know! <br /> <br /> Anyway, they have to right letters to them and they each get a guy who are: Mattthew (Paul), Sebastian, and Charlie. In the story Emily (Em) is with Charlie, Cassie with Matthew (Paul), and Lyd with Seb. In the beiginng I thought they all made a really cute couples, but later in the book we find something out about Cass and Matthew. I won't say because its pretty much the plot of the book. Anyway, let me tell you that Charlie and Em get pretty close and Charlie is just this totally sweet guy with a bad rep. Same with Seb. They totally bond with the guys they write to, and so does Cass but then something happens that even I didn't think would happen. Its all really funny to. Exspacially Matthew's first letter. Ha-halarious!!! <br /> <br />I give high praise to Jaclyn Moriarty for this book. LOL! This a book that alot of people can laugh out loud (lol) to. I think she made the charcters very realistic and some realistic then others to me (wink!). Trust me when I say this, great book!!!!! I totally recomand it!! Tennagers will love it everywhere! <br /> <br />Jessica	2005-01-18

It had romance, a crazy family, and excitement. I think she set a well-rounded setting and plot. Jordan has to go through something (that most of us don't have to go through) and handled it with grace. She was funny, and meets many funny people also. She is a great character to read about.    I totally recommend this book to anyone that wants a laugh, or loves Deb Caletti's work. Caletti brings these characters to life with their wit and actions. An amazing addition to the YA collection if you ask me!	2004-12-07

Bud is a very inspiring character and so is Herman E. Calloway. Even though these characters are fictional they are all very realistic. Curtis (the author) did a wonderful job on this book and it kept my attention.        The book is about a boy that's mother died and father is nowhere to be seen, and is now is an orphanage. He has kept these flyers or Herman E. Calloway and thought that this man was his father. He goes on the lam (runs away) and ends up in Hooperville with his best friend that was also an orphan. Bud misses the train that the men are to jump to find work. Bugs (his friend) makes it so Bud thinks of this as a sign to finally find his father. He tries to walk all the way from Flint to Rand Rapids but gets caught by a friendly man, and is offered to get a ride to Grand Rapids because he lies to the man, Lefty Lewis, and says that Herman E. Calloway is his father, and that he is running away instead of finding him. So he winded up finding Herman, and Herman is NOT his father. I won't tell you what happens because that would ruin the fun of the book.              This was a very good book. I thought it had a very strong main character, and even a stronger meaning. I loved the funny, and witty characters. Overall, the book was a good read. It was fun and interesting.	2004-10-05
