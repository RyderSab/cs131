Liv Kellerman, daughter to famous designer Peter Kellerman, is trying to find her new life after she and her husband split and she is left not having a clue where she fits in life. She won't call her father so she finds herself in a terrible apartment, with no job and no money. After a strange job as an assistant to a blind man with whom she has a bizarre chemistry, she eventually decides to go into real estate, passes the exam and is hired by a small company run by a lesbian who falls in love with her. She leaves to find a new agency and begins to rebuild her life. <br />While some of the characters in this book are quirky enough to summon a few giggles, the plot is fairly tedious and shallow as Liv finds herself defining her life and everyone in it by their apartments and real estate and she misses her ex-apartment much more than her ex-husband. <br />Recommended as fluff to read on a plane or in the car on your next trip.	2002-08-24

It was great fun to read and would make a hilarious movie.<br />Libby Mason is bad at relationships, shallow, and unsure of her desires. She is a chameleon with men as she changes to suit their interests. She is suddenly torn between what her heart is telling her and what her brain is thinking when she meets a powerful, wealthy man. Ed has everything she has ever dreamed of - money, fame, a mansion - and he keeps sending her flowers, gifts and takes her to all the \\"IT\\" places. On the other hand, her recently ended fling, which still has her reeling, was with Nick - a friend, a guy from the wrong side of town with no job, who likes to go to pubs, and discussing politics.<br />This book is hilarious, thanks largely in part to the relationship between Libby and her best friend Jules, whose conversations had me laughing so hard I cried.<br />A great summer read!	2002-08-06

Diana Moore lives a normal, somewhat mundane life in New York city, complaining about her job, her ex-boyfriend the \\"Monster\\", and other aspects of her life that she sees as pathetic. A horrible accident sends her into a roller coaster of emotion and depression. In an attempt to escape her new reality, she flees New York and her friends and finds herself lost in her thoughts and in rural New Jersey where a minor accident places her in Pine Barrens, in the home of some welcoming strangers. Here she spends an amazing two days, half lost in her thoughts, where she finally begins to heal. <br />This is a remarkable story, both sad and beautiful, that will stay with you for a long time to come.	2002-07-31

Corcoran is right up there with the best in the genre. The Mango Opera is a good mystery set in Key West with a little Miami thrown in and one good trip to Georgia. While the character development can be confusing - as none are well developed except Alex Rutledge - half the fun is created by your not knowing who is a good guy and who is a bad guy. The string of suspects is as long as some of the bridges connecting the Keys to the South Florida peninsula.<br />Alex Rutledge is our hero, and, like most of his buddies, is a true native to the Key West - a &quot;bubba&quot;, all of whose lives are intricately woven in and out of each other's. There are dark secrets, grudges and camaraderie all in one friendship. When Alex's ex-lovers start turning up dead it is hard to believe that it isn't personal.<br />The story will have you guessing until the bitter end. This is a quick, witty, wonderfully colorful, south Florida tale packed with a punch.	2002-07-30

I always finish Kinky's books feeling confused and a bit violated, but I have no idea why. The books are so entertaining although there is not much story - just a mix of insane people (who you just can't tell if they like each other or hate each other), and their often unfortunate lives. <br />Blast from the Past does give you some insight into the Kinkster's life and you learn things like how he came to live in his fourth floor apartment on Vandam Street, how he left country music to be a P.I., and how he came to know many of his cohorts such as Rambam, Ratso, Chinga and McGovern.<br />This book, along with other Kinkster books is just plain bizarre and silly!	2002-07-22

When investigative reporter Ted Eddingds is found dead in the Elizabeth River, Dr. Kay Scarpetta is filling in as the cheif medical examiner in the Tidewater area. Everything about this case is puzzling and she is certain her presence there is not appreciated. This is an excellent start to the book, however the plot quickly changes as Dr. Scarpetta returns to Richmond. Soon after, the death of her Tidewater assistant occurs in Richmond and she is quickly called to the scene of the murder. It takes over 200 pages for this story to begin to pull together, so for most of the book you are left wondering why the you are given all of these random bits of information. If you make it through, you will find out that it is all fairly relevant, and what does come together is a very complex and thouroughly researched mystery.	2002-07-17

Paterson knows how to dole out the suspense and keep you guessing. A rash of violent crimes take place around the DC area sending Alex Cross into a investigation with the FBI. Who is this criminal known as the Mastermind, and why is he killing innocent families even when his demands are met to the letter? The investigation team has little evidence to follow and as more crimes take place, things really heat up. <br />If I had to give the book one complaint it would be the little digressions into the personal life (or past personal life) of Alex Cross: the ex-girlfriend who doesnt like his job, the grandmother and children who worry about him, and his daughter's medical condition. I understand giving a little character background, but it became very distracting later in the book. <br />The ending of the book is surprising as you do not know who the Mastermind is until the last paragraph. Now I have to go get Violets are Blue to read the conclusion! <br />Excellent suspense!	2002-07-14

Why I started with Hot Six, I have no clue but you better believe I will pick up Seven Up and Hard Eight as soon as I can. <br />Jersey bounty hunter Stephanie Plum does not have the best of luck. She turns down the job to bring in fellow hunter Ranger but finds herself on his tail for other reasons. Ranger is wanted in connection with the murder of Homer Ramos whose family is in the business of dealing guns. Problem is, Homer found himself in someone elses business as well. In a town where the families of organized crime are described as \\"dis-organized\\" you better believe that the chase that ensues is quite comical. <br />In addition to the case with Ranger, Stephanie's other jobs bring more giggles than ever. When Stephanie Plum brings in a skip, the police know they are in for a laugh!<br />Evanovich is a master and brings in more bizarre characters in one neighborhood than you will believe. In the heart of a mystery, she knows just when to dish out a joke.<br />Thouroughly enjoyable!	2002-07-14

Demille is a wonderful storyteller and only receives one complaint from me: too many irrelevant descriptions into the past of lead Army CID investigator Paul Brenner. While some of this detail does help to develop Brenner's character, there is no relevance to the main plot and investigation into the murder of Captain Campbell - The General's Daughter. <br />The main plot brilliantly unfolds as layer upon layer of dark secrets and corruptions unfold on a Southern Georgia Army post. Going by forensic evidence, the initial search of the vicitm's property , and the half truths told by the victim's family and colleagues, the criminal investigation team attempts to recreate the sequence of events the night the murder occurred. The mystery behind the murder will leave you guessing!<br />An intelligent and suspenseful book that I highly recommend to my friends and family.	2002-07-07

Doc Ford travels to the luxurious Guava Key with his good friend Tomlinson. While there, Doc finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time when the attempted kidnapping of the daughter of a Washington bigwig takes place during one of his jogs. His service training comes back and, acting instinctively, Doc reacts heroically and saves the girl and her female bodyguard while being shot at and chased himself. Not wanting anyone to dig into his secret past, Doc claims that, being frightened by the events, he simply fell into the women, knocking them all into the water and out of danger. But no one will let this go - not the FBI, local Police, the girl, her powerful father, the kidnappers, or even his friend, Tomlinson. <BR>HERE is where I have a problem with the book. So far, we have a great basis for an exciting story, but White takes this opportunity to digress into a completely different story about his uncle who has passed away and the cousin he never knew about who has found him to seek his uncle's hidden treasure. I kept waiting and waiting for the two stories to somehow fit together but they never do. <BR>I DID give this a four star rating because I did like it. I like White's style and he does give you well developed and likeable characters with interesting tidbits into their pasts. I just wish the story had flowed better and that he had stuck to one storyline. <BR>This was my first book by White and I will read Ten Thousand Islands which seemed to fair a little better with the critics.	2002-06-23

In this fantastic debut, Moore creates a group of hilarious characters, including the unlikely duo Travis and Catch. Travis is a svelte looking 100-year-old man and Catch is his invisible demon companion who can only be seen by others when he is eating. When the two arrive in the seaside town of Pine Cove, a local man known as The Breeze becomes Catch's first meal. Moore introduces you to the other bizarre inhabitants of Pine Cove who all become involved in trying to take control of Catch or send him back to the Netherworld. The only thing you know for sure is that none of their lives will ever be the same. Christopher Moore has secured his place among my favorite authors and I cannot wait to read more of his zany adventures.	2002-06-16

Like most Mary Higgins Clark books, this one is a good, fast read and a good mystery. I thought I had the crime figured out and then changed my mind about 4 times, not knowing until the end which of my theories was correct. The main character, Emily changes jobs, sells some stock and moves to a quaint New Jersey seaside town where her ancestors had lived 100 years ago. A series of recent crimes has policed baffeld, and the town in a panic. The most eerie aspect of the crimes is their link and similarity to a series of crimes that took place 100 years ago involving one of Emily's ancestors and several other young women in the town at that time. There are a couple of side plots to keep you going as well. I would say this is one of her better books with a more involved plot than most.<BR>Clark is always a good standby!	2002-06-01

Nancy Stern begins receiving invitations, flowers and phone calls that are far too exciting and glamorous to be for her, when she realizes that another Nancy Stern has moved into the building. She finds it funny then annoying and finally one day takes a phone call from a man for the other Nancy Stern and goes on a date with him. Pretending to be the more glamorous Nancy Stern was fun, but she soon begins to fall for the guy and she must tell him who she really is. More incidences of mistaken identity pull her into the middle of a murder, a jewel theft investigation and she realizes that the man she has been dating has also been dishonest about who he really is.

His family, English teacher, and friends help pull him out of his shell and uncover a tereible incident from his childhood.
