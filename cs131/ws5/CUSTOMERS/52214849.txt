A highly intelligent, literate and adult piece of historical fiction with a pleasingly sophisticated plot that is very difficult to put down - also featuring Edgar Allan Poe as the eponymous boy (though crucial to the plot he is not one of the major characters as his father is). <br /> <br />Fully deserves the excellent reviews it received in the UK press, an enaging evocation of time and place and a wonderfully paced thriller.	2004-09-19

However, the author here is more concerned with weaving a satisfying, fantasy style storyline around the basic concept, than exploring these questions in any depth.	2004-09-16

It does not however seem to have occured to the author that the idea of the roman empire persisting for 2000 years, rather than fascinating, could actually be quite dull if not handled very imaginatively. The problem with attemping this sort of thing is that the real history of the period in question is usually a lot more interesting than the alternate.<br />It may be a a minor and idiosyncratic gripe, but abandoning the common english versions of names for the ubiquitous -us latin suffix, eg Hadrianus, Diocletianus etc etc etc, added noticeably to the sometimes pervasive sense of dullness for me at least.	2003-09-22

The book has it moments but struggles to rise above the quality of star trek's threadbare soap opera. The whole plot and especially the ending suffered from plodding predictability and lack of pzazz.

Firstly there is little sophistication,mystery or magic here, Leibers style has deteriorated sharply into dull, long winded self mockery in his advancing years. Secondly Rime isle is a sadly boring, mundane place quite unfitted for our two oh so worldy wise heroes to end their days. Thirdly those self-same heroes themselves have deteriorated into middle age tedium, most alarmingly, rather like their creator appears to have done. If you dont mind all that, then buy the book.	2003-02-12

Lack of attention to basic plotting too, for example the hero is forty years old and attended university in the late 70's yet the book is set in 2009, go figure.<br />Crichtons unique style makes it readable, but can't stop it insulting the intelligence, no doubt the basic issues need to be raised though.	2002-12-28

OK OK I confess, I only to got to page 80, and I also have to admit, hard science in SF novels is not that important to me, nor are the mechanics of interstellar spaceflight. But to make the mechanics of space flight, apparently using contemporary science, the main interest of the first 30% of your novel and then be so ludicrously ill informed about it really is an acute embarassment. Its reminiscent of someone who was a techical advisor to star wars. Characterisation and plot development were also weak areas, in fact the novel had no strengths, unless you count the fact the author seemed in a cheerful mood throughout and quite unaware of his own shortcomings. Avoid.	2002-12-02

There is also a clear dichotomy between male and female character development, with the some superbly skilfull female characterisation, but little of the same amongst the men. Overall the book lacks the absolute clarity and vividness of TSH, and I would hazard a guess is not as close to Ms Tartt's heart. It is however, consistently entertaining and enlightening, generally well written, very humurous in places, and like life, ultimately unresolved. Another reviewer commented that Carl Hiassen does better books of this type, total nonsense IMO, Mr Hiassen writes entertaining but quickly forgettable novels, Donna Tartt's linger in the mind for weeks or months afterward.	2002-11-07

I was impressed by her abilities as a prose stylist in some parts of the novel , especially those describing the remote past, however she lacks the ability to describe everyday reality in an interesting way, unlike say Stephen King, who at his (now distant) best, comfortably surpasses her even as a prose stylist. The book is reasonably original, unfortunately that doesn't make it any good, there are some compelling parts to the fantasy, the encounters with the human incarnation of the `monsters' are for example are excellent, nervertheless, I couldnt help thinking when reading them that Mr King, say, would have done them significantly better.<br />Pacing problems abound, and a distinctive emotional monotony saturates the writing with the the main characters existing in a permanent state of confused fear, while the motivations which lie behind their actions are often totally implausible. Inevitably as a result, the characters seem undeveloped and fail to elicit great interest or sympathy.<br />The author's knowledge and understanding of Beowulf appears to be rather lightweight too, and though the work itself is an excellent choice as a kind of `sacred text\\" backdrop to the novel, its considerbale possibilities are wasted in Kiernan's hands. <br />All in all a pretty inept and dissapointing effort, from an author who does give many hints of significant talent and originality.	2002-08-31

Not too much of interest in any of the characters or indigenous fauna, save perhaps the Noctambulo. Way, way below Silverbergs epic best, but an easy, empty read.	2002-08-28

I have fond memories of reading clan as a 10 year old, but on re-reading that I have to say it now seemed flawed and unusually silly to me. The ludicrous perfection of Ayla's character is present even in the early novel, and I now find myself wondering how much of Shelters poor reception is due to its audience maturing and increasing in literary awareness over the long Aul-less years, and how much is due to the (undoubted) lower quality of the writing herein.	2002-06-29

Niven was an excellent SF writer in his heyday, but his heyday is sadly long gone.

What really got me was the willingness of the pathetic self centred little twerp who is the &quot;hero&quot; to sacrifice (for all he knew) millions of lives and alter the course of history to gratify his puerile romantic impulses in respect of some woman from the past he's only known for a day.	2001-10-01

Very disappointing, the all to brief bits about the Chaga (An alien ecosystem forcibly unleashed on the earth to the supposed benefit of mankinds future evolution - pity about the rest of life on earth) are excellent, but the novel is otherwise far too long, this would have better as a novella or short story. Mcdonald has little else to say, can't do plot, is very variable on characterisation and his fiercely held, and not very original, political views permeate the novel making everything, including the ending, far too predictable. He doesnt even seem capable of seeing that his wonderful Chaga is easily viewable as the grossest most arrogant form of 'pseudo colonization' imaginable.	2001-09-15

I always feel that Silverberg's heart isnt in this vast but rather anodyne and predictable imaginary world, which sadly comes across as patently manufactured.<br />I notice that Silverberg said in rather disparaging fashion recently, that he has never read LOTR . He should do, a few lessons from someone whose literary skill in this area far exceeds his own wouldnt go amiss. On the other hand Silverberg is undoubtedly a great SF writer, his short story skills in the genre are peerless, though in the novel medium I would say he has been below par for the last five years, lets hope we have seen the last of Majipoor.	2001-06-13
