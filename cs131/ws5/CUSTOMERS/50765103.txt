Planning for a family vacation to Disney World can be as complex as launching an expedition to Anarctica -- and nearly as expensive if you aren't careful! If you've made the decision to take the plunge and head for the most popular family vacation spot in America spend that first few dollars on the most current edition of Birnbaum's book. This book will help you save both time and money.<br />Birnbaum's guide was a great choice for me -- I'm a \\"gotta have everything organized in advance\\" kind of person and the detailed, accurate information in this guide helped me do everything from pick out a hotel and book a ride from the airport to organize a packing list and rough-in plans for daily itineraries. Although the guide was absolutely jammed with information it was in a very readable format with lots of color, charts and sidebars. Birnbaum's also helped walk us through a lot of the decisions -- for example we decided to splurge on a nice on-resort hotel with access to the monorail knowing we would want to spend the middle part of most days relaxing at the pool with the kids. To balance that expense, we took Birnbaum's tip and had lunches at the nicer restaraunts instead of the more expensive (and more crowded) dinners. <br />My husband also found Birnbaum's guide very helpful and he is more of a \\"let's just wing-it\\" sort of vacation planner. On the days he was in charge of activities he carried the Birnbaum's book with him and used it to pick restaraunts, find less crowded rides and choose activities near wherever we happened to be walking. The color-coding on the sides of the pages helped him quickly find the section of the book he wanted just as soon as he pulled it out of the bag.<br />By far the best feature were the sample schedules -- these helped us avoid the crowds during our vacation (Christmas week one of the most crowded times of the year). In fact, using Birnbaum's advice we got to the parks early and walked onto many rides without waiting at all. Once theparks started getting crowded we used the tips on fast passes to cut our waiting time significantly on the more popular rides.<br />There's lots and lots of information out there on how to plan and enjoy your Disney Vacation -- I highly recommend checking out the Disney web site (booking online can save more $$$) and buying this guide. Maybe you won't have to spend an entire semester's worth of college savings after all!	2004-05-31

If you are looking for ways to connect elementary-age kids with the beauty of the Mass this is a fantastic resource.  I'm the director of a small (35 students) RE program and we used this book for the first time in our program this year.<br />You can use the book as written for pre-schoolers or cover more lessons per class with older students.  We combined the Kindergarten through third grade classes and covered the material in five sessions:  Introductory Rites, Liturgy of the Word, Liturgy of the Eucharist, Concluding Rites and a lesson we added at the beginning where we showed the children around the church, the sacristy, sacramentary, etc.<br />The book is laid out in a very understandable way and includes lesson plans with dialogue so even your novice teachers should feel comfortable.  Great craft projects that can be run on the copier and don't need much supplies beyond crayons and scissors.<br />A great value -- we will use it every year!	2004-04-03

Cautions about the content should be heeded: if you are offended by violent, scatalogical or just plain gross content this book is not for you -- they say you should write what you know and clearly Dave Barry knows a LOT about vomit.  But he also knows what's funny -- from the octogenarian nursing home escapees to the mobster wannabe in his clam suit costume to the aging potheads in the band and the flatulent waitress (okay another thing he knows WAY too much about)Dave Barry loves the inane and the absurd among us.  In Tricky Business, the ridiculous meets the criminal and the result is the most fun since Gilligan set sail.	2003-04-12
US	50765103	R2RCKG9B8JEQYB	0375414290	333703164	When the Emperor Was Divine	Books	5	50	59	N	N	Lovely, Lyrical, Haunting	I plucked this book off the shelf at the library yesterday, flipped it open to see if I liked the writing style and almost forgot to pick the kids up at school half an hour later because I had completely fallen into the world of this novella and lost track of time.<br />When the Emperor was Divine is the literary equivallent of ikebana -- elegant in its spareness and revealing great beauty beneath the simple balance of form and substance. Author Julie Otsuka doesn't miss a step in this compelling, disturbing story of a Japanese American family torn apart, interred in separate camps; mother, daughter and son in one, father in another. <br />Confused, helpless, longing for each other, yearning for the comforts of home, hearth, and happier days, the family spends three and a half years waiting. Waiting for release, waiting to be reunited, waiting for a tulip to grow in an old tin can. Ms. Otsuka doesn't give us the details -- she walks us right into the bodies, hearts and minds of each of her characters and makes us live with them. And in the end of the endless waiting we return with them to the scattered remains of a life that is less than what is normal, necessary or desirable. My heart broke a hundred times in the few short hours it took to read this slim book.<br />It is particularly compelling to think of the men interred in Cuba right now and wonder if a future generation will tell their story as poignantly. I recommend this book for the quality of the writing and the timliness of the story.	2003-04-12

In Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman author Elizabeth Buchan has given us a new heroine to love; confident, comfortable, charming and successful forty-eight year old Rose.  Although we meet her on the eve of her undoing (at the hands of her convincingly conniving husband- and job-stealing assistant), Rose is no hand-wringing cliche of the wife-done-wrong.  Instead our Rose navigates her new, and painful world with the grace, dignity and class we all wish we could muster when things come undone in our lives.  Rose is not destroyed by her suffering, she is transformed in a deeply satisying and understandable way.  I especially recommend this book for the quality of the writing which was consistently exquisite from page one through the final chapter.	2003-03-29

The characters are meaningfully drawn and well developed and will stay with you long after you turn the last page.  The author's masterful use of Nova Scotia as the setting is absolutely perfect (and perfectly rendered) for this dark and disturbing story. A solid selection for your book club.	2003-02-24

This book relieved me of so much anxiety and negativity!  Though I spent years studying the piano, I always viewed practicing as a chore and would drive myself into a nervous, sleepless, frenzy of practicing before every recital.  My final recital was twelve years ago -- I had worked myself into a horrible state, had come to despise the piece I was preparing (Beethovan's Six Variations), gave a lousy performance, quit my lessons and got rid of my piano.  When a friend asked me to store his piano in our home I started playing again and was amazed to find that I still felt anxious although I was not preparing for any performance.<br />My son's violin teacher loaned me this book and I must say if I'd read it twelve years ago I never would have given up the piano.  Using this book I analyzed my physical approach to playing for the first time and realized my posture was horrible and I was actually clenching my teeth when I played!  Now I am enjoying myself so much more and I feel so comfortable that I have started playing as an accompanist.<br />There's much that's useful in this book though you may (like me) skip a lot of the technical information or parts that seem geared more toward professional musicians.  I especially recommend this book for anyone with performance anxiety.	2003-02-24

The recipes are organized by the months of the year to emphasize seasonal preferences and produce availability.  Turn to January for great hot soups and stews in the cold months, look for lighter choices and some wonderful cold soups in the summer chapters.  There are 175 (!) soup recipes in this book, all simple enough to prepare every day for your family and many elegant (yet still easy to prepare) for entertaining.  The Vegetable stock in this cook book is the best and most flavorful I've ever tried and I freeze tons of it in four-cup ziplock freezer bags to use in vegetarian dishes.  <br />The recipes are meant to be experimented with and the author gives great advice for substitutions and seasoning in the preface.  Because of the special emphasis on seasonal availability of produce this cook book is the perfect choice for the kitchen gardener.	2003-02-20

I found &quot;When Character was King&quot; to be well written with an enjoyable, engaging tone, however, I am bothered that the author spins a relentlessly positive picture of a complex presidency that deserves a more balanced analysis.  For example, President Reagan certainly earned his spurs and deserves his legacy as the man who faced down the Soviets and this is well documented here.  But the author glosses over the fact that the largest peacetime military buildup in history (one of the key factors in forcing the Soviets to the table) cost a lot of money that had to come from somewhere and certainly contained broad social and economic consequences.  It's as if the money was pulled out of a hat.  Also, the not-so-subtle jabs at Presidents Clinton and Carter were annoying as were the frequent comparisons to JFK and the puffing up of President Bush Junior.   Although I prefer a more balanced view, I recommend &quot;When Character was King&quot; as a good read about a fine American.	2003-02-19

I found the writing stilted (especially the dialogue) with too much exposition. A lot more heavy lifting is required to move this plot forward, especially with the ambitious number of characters involved. Barely two hundred (widely spaced) pages wasn't enough to develop the story line or the characters.	2003-02-12

Her strong message resonates equally well for those in the corporate world to those working at home or the full-time stay at home parent -- trying to balance the demands of our lives can trap us in the unreasonable expectation we can please everybody all the time. <br />Life's Work is about the emotional conflict we all feel whether we have to work at a despised job for the paycheck or need to work in a beloved field for personal fulfillment.  We know that family and friends matter most in life but the devil is in the details --  juggling the mechanics of getting through each day when there is more than one person (or even two) can reasonably accomplish, coping when the unexpected overwhelms the system, deciding how best to care and provide for those we love who depend on us.  <br />The essays are short enough to read in five-minute bites (great to tuck in your bag for that wait in the doctor's office or the long line at the bank) and is also fun to read straight through.  It's an especially great book for any parent (Mom or Dad) trying to write professionally at home.  Lisa Belkin's take on combining a writing life with a family life had me laughing out loud.	2003-02-11

The main character, Sarah Hurlihy, is a forty-something pre-school teacher who decides to drag herself out of her post-divorce depression and &quot;get back out there.&quot;  What Sarah finds &quot;out there&quot; is enough comic relief to fuel her through one disasterous encounter after another.  With her large and colorful family trooping in and out of her life at inopportune times with troubles and demands of their own Sarah's challenges are huge and her privacy non-existant.  Every failed encounter, foible and mis-step is grist for the family rumor mill.  I thought the main character's sadness over the end of her marriage was very sensitively woven into the story and gave a nice counterpoint to the spirit and determination she showed to rediscover herself and find a new life and a new love.  Nice and light -- an average reader could read this book start to finish in an afternoon or two.	2003-02-10

Tightly written and wonderfully descriptive, A Walk in the Woods is the story of Bill and his sidekick Stephan Katz.  These two are not your typical outdoorsman but two relatively sedentary middle-aged men who undertake one of the most challenging hikes on the continent armed with little more than a backpack full of Little Debbie cakes (soon abandoned)and the vague notion of hiking the two-thousand odd miles of the trail in one season. <br />It's not spoiling the story to tell you they don't even come close to meeting that goal, but the story is so rich and so fun it helps demonstrate that the joy is really in the journey, not the destination.<br />I loved this book for its honest and direct tone and the way Bryson kept me laughing from page one.  A great read for a rainy winter afternoon.	2003-02-08

These cookbooks consistently offer extensive recipe collections (hundreds) organized by the month they appear in the magazine -- I find this feature expecially helpful in the spring and summer when I am looking for lighter meals to prepare for my family.  <br />Although I have an extensive (fifty plus) collection of cookbooks I find myself reaching for these books first whenever I am looking for inspiration for a special meal or party. The entertaining ideas and tips always offer up something fresh, new and easy to try.  <br />Those of us who live in the colder climes of the north appreciate the soul-soothing traditional foods of our southern sisters.   So, if you are looking for a tasty plate of chicken or a hot bowl of spicy gumbo you are sure to find it in these collections.  But you will positively find a wide variety of other tastes and cooking needs met here too. <br />I'm an avid and experienced cook and I really enjoy the clear organization of these books and the individual recipes.  Novice cooks will also find the directions consistently clear and easy to use.<br />I think the best thing about the Southern Living Annual Recipe collections are the illustrations, which are strikingly beautiful photographs that rate right up there with cookbooks in my collection that cost twice as much.	2003-01-14

I am especially fond of the nutrition analysis included with each recipe and the tips for making recipes lower in fat.  The prep-times included with each recipe were also a new, and very useful, feature to me.  Plus the editors upgraded the book to reflect the wider availability of formerly &quot;exotic&quot; fruits and vegetables now in the everyday market.<br />The fledgling cook will find everything needed to confidently accomplish any task from hard-boiling an egg to properly setting the table for a family meal or a buffet-style party.  Pesky, but common, cooking terms like &quot;al dente&quot; and &quot;crisp-tender&quot; are explained in a straight forward manner in the cooking basics section where you will also find great tips for stocking a pantry or purchasing the basic cooking equipment you might need when just starting out.  <br />Useful features for all levels of cook are scattered throughout the text.  For example, there is a full-page photograph of different pastas with the name under each (finally! I now know the difference between Gemelli and Fusilli!).  Also very useful are the extensive illustrative photos of retail cuts of meat cross-referenced to the wholesale cut and listing the best way to cook each cut.<br />One of my favorite things about the hardcover cookbook is the three-ring binder format. This makes it possible to lay the book flat on the counter or prop it up nearby with, or without, a cookbook stand.  It also makes it easier to add your own notes right alongside your favorite recipes.<br />I love to give this cookbook as a gift to a young person just starting out  -- inside a big crockpot or tied together with some fun kitchen tools.	2003-01-14

Brothers Oliver and Charlie are regular guys in dead end jobs with a stack of life-sucking medical bills to pay and an overworked mother they both adore.  They discover the opportunity to commit what they think is the perfect crime; they'll steal three million dollars from a dead man's abandoned account.  It's the classic criminal seduction -- no one is going to get hurt, no one is going to get caught, and everyone is going to end up on easy street with all thier problems solved.<br />Predictably, as soon as the deed is done, circumstances spin out of control and the brothers are reminded in one painful way after another that all actions have consequences.<br />A fun and quick read, good for a long rainy day or a boring airplane ride.  The writing is tight, the action is non-stop, the characters compelling and the plot interesting.	2003-01-03

She is small and very funny\\"  These opening lines set the sweet and gentle tone for a tale about two sisters.  One (Lola) with a very long list of foods she will not eat, and the other (Charlie) with the task of feeding dinner to her fussy little sister.<br />It could be a recipe for disaster -- I'm certain this situation would have played out quite differently with me and MY little sister -- but Charlie's creativity and sense of fun save the day.<br />My seven-year old fussy eater nearly fell out of his chair laughing when we read this book.  He clearly identified with, and enjoyed, Lola and her reasoning (for example, peas are \\"too small\\" and \\"too green\\").  While I'm pretty sure my son will not change his eating habits because of this story, it did give him a sense that he is not alone in the world with his funky tastes while reinforcing the idea that his tastes may change.<br />Great story, cute illustrations, good lesson.	2003-01-02

Meg Files goes beyond the &quot;How to&quot; genre and delves into the writers psyche to explore the ways many of us try to limit ourselves creatively.   Sometimes Ms. Files plays the stern writing professor with specific advice --(&quot;Stay at the desk, just stay at the desk&quot;), and compelling writing exercises (worth the price of the book just for these) other times she is the pragmatic therapist (&quot;writer's block is just fear of writing badly&quot;) but mostly she is the strong voice of a compassionate and knowledgeable friend.<br />Throughout the book you will find specific and useful advice on everything from jump-starting your own writing to how to take (and deliver) criticism, dealing with fear of failure and how to define your own success (hint: not usually tied to publication thankfully).  I'm glad this is the first writing book I read in the New Year -- I feel charged up and ready to rumble!  Good reading!	2003-01-02

This book is a fantastic resource for those days when you are struggling to think of new ways to have fun with the kids.  I liked the variety, for example some projects did not require a lot of advance preparation and can be done in under thirty minutes, while others look quite involved.  And it's not all just a bunch of arts and crafts --this book includes tons of games and activities for everything from snowday fun to a day at the beach.  There are also some fun with food projects (though this section doesn't offer much that's new if you already have any cooking with kids books).  I've only had the book a week and I've already used several of the ideas -- my third grade son and I made the marshmallow snowman on page 129 for a school project and we used the backyard games section to plan party games for ten boys.  That was a blast! This book reminded us of some old games we loved to play when we were kids and helped us think up some new games.  The party was a big success and this is a great book to have on hand for those times you'd love to have the T.V. turned off and the kids tuned in to fun!	2002-12-22

The arrangements are not that difficult, yet they sound very satisfying and are fun to play.  I think any second or third year piano student will have the skills needed to play anything in this book.  It's great to have such a big collection in one book (110 songs!) so I don't have to switch around and search through other books and sheet music to find what everyone wants to sing.  All of the standards are included as are a lot of hard-to-find favorites like &quot;Blue Christmas&quot; and &quot;All I want for Christmas is my Two Front Teeth.&quot; I love the hardback/spiral bound edition which lays nicely flat on the piano.  Also, most songs are on two facing pages so there's not a lot of page turning.  One of the best features is the songbook you get with the lyrics -- this means I can pass out copies so everyone can sing without crowding over my shoulder to use the book I'm trying to play from.  I just got this book two days ago and I've already spent tons of time at the piano just enjoying playing through the arrangements.  Great book and a good value.	2002-11-25

Just when you start to care about a character and get interested in one part of the story line you were off in another direction and following the thread of three or four other characters' stories.  This was a frustration I experienced with Michener's writings too but I found the difference was that Michener always rewarded me by wrapping all the threads into one satisying whole by the end of the book.  This did not happen for me with Horse Heaven; the ending felt very unsatisfying and incomplete.  If you are a fast reader (i.e., if you regularly read one or more books a week) I recommend this book for the beautiful quality of the writing and the wealth of fascinating characters.  I also recommend it to anyone who really loves horses. For anyone just looking for a fast and fun read about the world of horse racing, you'll enjoy a Dick Francis mystery more.	2002-11-16

One cannot dispute this author's success in at least one area: Scott Ritter has been an extremely effective lightning rod for controversy for almost as many years as he was an inspector!  No matter where you are on the spectrum of opinion regarding the man himself, it is useful and enlightening to read this record of what happened while he was at UNSCOM.   The writing does bog down at times as the author attempts to make the mostly tedious task of arms control inspection seem more action-packed -- for every trigger-happy Iraqi soldier with a gun in your face or fleet-footed chase through a laboratory there are pages and pages of exposition. Overall though Mr. Ritter blends the exposition to build his case well and it rings as true today as it did four years ago; international political committment to the process of inspection is the safest path to effective disarmament of Iraq.  This is not a question of loyalty, patriotism,or personalities -- it is a simple commitment to what works best and costs least.	2002-11-16

This would make a nice gift for any aspiring writer on your Christmas list but I think it would have a special resonance for younger writers (twelve to fourteen).  This book neatly illustrates the idea that struggling to meet others' expectations just doesn't contain the satisfaction (or rewards) of honoring one's own muse.  I wish Writer Ferrets existed when I was fifteen and got a &quot;C&quot; on a creative writing asignment.   From that moment, I spent decades trying to raise that grade by writing what I thought others wanted to read.  Like the main character in &quot;Chasing the Muse&quot; I found myself stuck and producing writing that had nothing to do with my own inner voice.  Lucky for me I found a friend who showed me the error of my ways and later gifted me with this book to underscore her point.  If you are a struggling (or blocked) writer, I think you'll enjoy a quiet hour or two with the &quot;Writer Ferrets.&quot;	2002-11-11

I've always enjoyed reading aloud to my children and Rescue Ferrets at Sea was a special treat for me and my two sons (ages six and eight).  Richard Bach does not &quot;write down&quot; to children -- instead he gives us a richly textured fable for all ages filled with action and adventure as well as strong role models both male and female (and furred and feathered).  Mostly I just love a book that I can share with my children that is beautifully written and also holds something of interest for me (any parent who has suffered through some of the &quot;Babysitter Club&quot; genre knows what I'm talking about).  I am thrilled that the Ferrets are intended to be a series -- we've already finished Air Ferrets Aloft and can't wait for the next Ferret adventure!	2002-07-06

The most important book for women and health since &quot;Our Bodies, Ourselves&quot;!  I learned that hormonal, emotional and spiritual shifts related to menopause begin as much as a decade before menstration ends.  Though the book strives to include everyone, I think mothers will benefit the most from her advice.  It was enlightening to learn how the changing needs of my family change me -- and that hormonal shifts can make these transitions even more painful. With one child heading off to college and the youngest just entering first grade I have been feeling very off-balance and overwrought.  After reading this book I made some changes in my personal life and my diet that improved my outlook and made us all happier.  Northrup empowered me with information -- I now feel capable of honoring this new phase in my life with grace and dignity.	2002-06-02

Not because of any literary merit (your average High School junior has more writing talent than these two)and certainly not due to anything that might pass as substance in the content (there is not one new idea anywhere in the text).  The value in this book is the joy of the ride into battle with Carville and Begala.<br />These are two men who know what they are good at and clearly love their work.  Carville and Begala give you a front-row seat to view how they run a battle for power.  And you will enjoy the show they put on.  Their strategies for winning are laid out in twelve \\"rules\\" illustrated with amusing anecdotes and cautionary tales.  Although the rules are pretty basic Management 101 (work hard, communicate well) it is motivating and interesting to see Carville and Begala's thinking laid out in an engaging voice that is really, really fun to read.<br />This book is worth reading but don't expect touchy-feely self help or a tome about the nobility of leadership.  The folksy good ol' boy tone of the book does not disguise the strong message that strategies of aggression work, that anyone who wants to get (and hold) political power today needs the biggest, baddest, ugliest, junkyard dogs on the block to help them do it and that, if you decide you want to win, then for pity's sake be willing to get in there and fight.  Oh, and if you get nothing else from Carville and Begala the recipe for chicken salad (page 154) is worth the price of this book!	2002-06-01

His work is carefully researched -- in addition to his own considerable investigative work (which resonates on every page) he includes 55 pages of notes, a two-page acknowledgement and a six-page bibliography.  Schlosser engaged and instructed me with stories of compelling characters that illustrate both the horrors and the heroics in the global fast-food industry.  The author doesn't simply beat the anti-establishment drum; he does not question or criticize the basic responsibility of businesses to run at a profit.  What Schlosser does, and does very well, is force the reader to think about the line between profit and greed, the balance of efficiency versus exploitation, and the vulnerabilities of the very young and the very poor.  Best of all, Eric Schlosser's fabulous and disturbing book reminded me who is really responsible for what happens in business in this country -- me.  This book inspired me to exercise my rights as an American and a consumer; there are fast food restaurants in this country that care about health and fairness, I'll eat there (Schlosser highlights two or three in the book).  I'll be writing my congressional representatives to emphasize that I am watching the industry that puts contaminated food in school lunches and children's meals at fast food restaurants and they had better be watching too.  I will insist on better legislation and enforcement instead of corporate window-dressing and political pay-offs in the form of campaign contributions. <br />If you want to lead an un-examined life -- if you choose to believe what happens in big business doesn't impact your world, if you need to enjoy that Domino's pizza with your must-see-TV, if you hope to have any peace of mind while your child eats a Happy Meal -- do not read this book!  This is the best book I've read in years.  It inspired me to make some changes and to start thinking about what my mother always said &quot;Don't put that in your mouth!  You don't know where it's been!&quot;	2002-05-26
