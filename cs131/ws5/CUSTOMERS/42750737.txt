There are only some superficial similarities.  They are both excellent writers, and they write about the same area of Manhattan.  There the similarites end.Mendelson's characters are, for the most part, educated, intelligent, sophisticated.   Colwin's characters are educated, intelligent, sophisticated and HUMANE.  I found most of the characters in \\"Love, Work, Children\\" to be insufferably smug and airlessly unpleasant.All I can say is that I wish Ms. Mendelson well in her future endeavours.	2005-10-03

Marks has no new insights about the shift from scratch cooking to package/mix cooking starting in the 1950s. The real value of this book is in the earliest chapters, when Marks speaks about the pioneering Betty Crocker radio programs, including the \\"Cooking School of The Air,\\" which ran from 1924 to 1948.  Betty was of real help in the Depression of the 1930s, and the Second World War. A fascinating element in the chapter of how Betty has been illustrated through the years is Norman Rockwell's image of Betty.  A near miss, in my belief.  My favourite Betty is the one from 1965, sometimes called the \\"Presidential\\" Betty, for her slight resemblance to Jacquline Kennedy.This book is worth reading, but I firmly believe that four stars are sufficient.	2005-06-01

One thing, the hymn is \\"Our God, Our Help in Ages Past,\\" not \\"Oh God.....\\"  And some of the recipes, which are mostly Southern classics (and rightly so!) lack crucial information as to pan sizes, or yields.  If you're not going to cook from this book, no problem, but many of the recipes are so appealing, that it is really unfortunate that they were not edited better.	2005-05-07

Hunt's memoir, \\"On Hitler's Mountain,\\" is a valuable, fascinating addition to the accounts of the Second World War.Hunt, born in 1934, gives a clear, heartbreaking account of daily life during the 12 years of Hitler's regime.She makes no excuses for how her countrymen (and parents) fell for Hitler's line of a \\"greater Germany,\\" particularly after the horrid, humiliating Treaty of Versailles, the subsequent inflation and hunger of the Weimar period, and the seeming miracle of the 1933-1938 period.Her father was a draftee in the German army, and died in France.  Illustrated with family photographs, and appropriate non-family photographs, this book is well worth reading, and deserves to be included in school curricula worldwide. Hunt grew up, came to the States, married, had two children, and became an executive in several organisations in defence of the environment.	2005-05-07

I joined a book club this past year (2004), and it's been intresting to read books I normally would not choose to read on my own.  Jodi Picoult's My Sister's Keeper is decidely a book I would not have read otherwise.  I do not have a anything against fiction by women.  Some of my favoourite authors include Susan Isaacs, Elinor Lipman, and Margaret Atwood, to name only a few.  The concept is interesting.. is it right to concieve a child to save the life of another child?The characters are not precisely one dimensional, but are not fully rounded.  I would not be willing to have dinner with most of them.What irritates me the most of this could have been great book is the ending.  Instead of making some tough choices, Picoult engages in a very \\"deus ex machina\\" event, where choice is eliminated.  It is almost as if she had written herself into a corner, and was too impatient to think and then write herself out of this corner.I am not sure if I will read any other books by Jodi Picoult.	2005-04-16

Lorna Sass's \\"Pressure Perfect\\" really is that, I believe.She starts with a clear, but not stupidly oversimplified guide to pressure cookers and pressure cooking.  To me, this section is almost worth the price of the book.I have an older, American made \\"jiggle top\\" pressure cooker, and these recipes work flawlessly in my cooker.The dishes range from very standard \\"American\\" dishes like chili and pot roast and excellent mashed potatoes that are very nearly as fast as instant, to rissottos, to a really delicious Chicken Biryani.The timing charts for meats, vegetables, and grains are presented twice, which is very handy.  They are presented first in each section, and again at the end of the book, before the clear and concise index.None of the ingredients are impossible to find, and even the ones that are not common, can be mail/phone ordered.  Sass includes contact information for stores and pressure cooker manufacturers.Wild rice is one of my favourite grains, and until I got this book, I rarely had wild rice beacuse of the lengthy conventional cooking time.  I have it a lot more often.This is a well written, easy to use, friendly book.	2005-02-08

I have been baking bread for over 15 years, and I knew more than a little, but this book has opened a wider world.  She has diminished some of my anxiety about sourdough bread, by talking about her sourdough anxiety, which she vanquished.Ms. Beranbaum encourages mechanical mixing, and does not consider it a &quot;crime,&quot; like some other writers on bread.  However, manual mixing is included.  She has written lots of information on flours.  Detailed, yet accessible.She encourages home bakers to think in more professional terms by giving weight measures (grams and ounces,) as well as volume measures (cups, spoons).  She also gives proportion percentages.Ms Beranbaum's introductory comments are fascinating.The index is complete and easy to use.The photos and technical drawings are complete and well chosen.This book is definitely one of MY &quot;desert island ten.&quot;	2003-11-17

Some of Colwin's titles include \\"Family Happiness,\\" \\"Goodbye Without Leaving,\\" and \\"Another Marvelous Thing.\\"In \\"Morningside Heights,\\" there is a predictable subplot about a corrupt attorney.  This subplot ends in a \\"virtue rewarded, evil vanquished\\" manner.The jacket flap states that this is the first of a trilogy.

I chose this as my first book of his.  I am glad I did!I was alive, though very young, during the United States' involvement in Vietnam, and had just a child's view.  A pacifist child's view, but a child's view.(and yes, as a life (so far!) resident of Kent, Ohio, I experienced a certain amount of protest, including May, 1970.)An American Requiem filled in gaps, and has sparked my thinking and will direct my future reading.James Carroll tried to reconcile with his father, at least, that's how I read this fine, gripping book.Not all parents are always right, and not all children are always wrong.He included a small selection of interesting (mostly family) photographs.I consider my time reading An American Requiem to be time well spent.If it matters at all, I am not a Catholic (I belong to the United Church of Christ,) but find the Roman Catholic Church to be worthy of study and reflection.I hope to eventually meet James Carroll, and would really like to talk about Dads, Sons, and men with him.	2003-08-22

Jean Anderson has written another wonderful processor book.  Her first processor book, Jean Anderson`s Processor Cooking, was published in 1979, and a slightly revised editon in 1983.This is even better than those two good books.Some material, particularly in the very useful front section, where she talks about foods and how the processor affects them, and how many slices, or how many cups you may get from an item has been retained, but there are enough new and wonderful recipes to make purchasing this book a good decision.I like her comments, and her notes on a recipe`s background.The recipes may seem to run long, but they are easy and complete.  If something is supposed to happen, she says it will.  There are NO traps in a Jean Anderson recipe.  The only surprise is in how delicious the food is.  By that, I mean, no matter how good you think a Jean Anderson dish will taste, it always tastes better! Another reviewer commented about garlic and seasonings.  Well, garlic can always be reduced, and so can seasonings in cooking. Unlike baking, which is more like easy science, seasoning in cooking is flexible.  However, DO try these dishes the way Ms. Anderson writes them.Someone, perhaps the same reviewer, said that most of the recipes were too adventurous.  The world is shrinking!  An easy way to begin to understand another country, another people is to explore their foods and foodways.  A friend with school aged children has used some recipes in this (and other Jean Anderson books) to enrich her children's experiences--there are dishes in \\"Process This\\" from Europe, South America, and Asia...In closing, this is another excellent book by one of our best cookbook writers.	2003-02-13

I've made one recipe, &quot;Soot's Flapjacks&quot; from the &quot;Children's&quot; section, and they came out well.  However, they are unleavened.Yes, I really wish the American edition had not been rushed into print, and that the recipes had been more thoroughly tested.However, not all of the recipes are flawed.  I have baked for many years, and can tell when a recipe is seriously off.  So can most expierenced home bakers.  Novices, beware.Not all of the dishes are depending on precise chemical mixtures, so this book still has merit.I found the endpapers to be a highly funny, very satiric depiction of media derived &quot;domestic goddesses&quot; from the 1950s-60s in England.  These enpapers were misconstrued in England, as an anti-feminist statement.  They are not, they are meant ironically.Nigella Lawson does not order anyone into the kitchen.

Marla is a useful source of information and gossip among the well oiled set of &quot;Aspen Meadows.&quot;  However, I do miss Macguire.Yes, Arch's adolescent antics are not too charming, but Davidson seems to have a plan, and  in the last section of the book, Arch shows signs of civility.I am not convinced that Arch's sometimes awful behaviour can always be linked to his father, John Richard (the Jerk) Korman.I always read Davidson's acknowledgements, and she states  that her brother was a World Trade Center SURVIVOR.  That may, or may not have anything to do with the few flaws in the book, but mercy, give her a break.  I am willing to believe that any bumps in the story are due to  the intense emotions we all felt, and the even greater ones she and her family might have experienced.

It won't be my last book by her.<br />Communion: The Female Search for Love is part memoir, part challenge, and very thoughtprovoking.<br />One aspect I liked best was her debunking of the myth of \\"women who love too much.\\"  Another center of focus is the effect of gainful employment on the perceptions of love.<br />Her language is direct and clear, but not simplistic.<br />This is a very good book, and one that I hope will be widely read and discussed.<br />Even though her subtitle is \\"The Female Search for Love,\\" men can learn from this worthwhile book, if they have the courage to read it.<br />This might be an excellent choice for a book group.	2002-03-07

Duff Brenna's The Altar of The Body is an odd, not too likable, but hard to forget book.<br />Brenna's ability to define character in a few lines is a strength of this book.

Many aspects of the (now) global gay culture are represented.The characters range in age from late teenagers with other teenagers, to men in their forties. There are decorative sketches at the beginning of each story, and brief biographies of each writer.Every time I re-read this book I am startled again, at how very good it is.	2001-12-19

I have been absorbed by Mary Cassatt's art for years, and this delightful little novel gives an imaginary, yet plausible look into some of Mary Cassatt's best work,featuring her older sister Lydia.I have long been intersted in late 19th and early 20th century France, and the art produced then.Harriet Scott Chessman's research shows in great, though not overwhelming detail of the life of a bourgeois American family with a serioulsy talented artist in their midst.Lydia Cassatt died too early of a now treatable kidney condition, and Chessman shows how the family may have coped with her illness. However, this is not a glum book at all, it is very warm, loving, and cheerful in spots.The five Mary Cassatt paintings are well chosen and well reproduced.	2001-12-17

I like baseball, but am no one's idea of a major fan.  I can't quote batting averages, I'm not sure which expansion team is in which league-I did like this book however.Jim Ksicnski had a fascinating career as the manager of the visitor's clubhouse of the Milwaukee Brewers.This is as much a piece of social history as it is a baseball memoir.  How baseball players have changed over the years, how American men have changed over the years.This is an interesting, friendly book.  Tom Flaherty's contributions are seamless, &quot;Big Jim's&quot; voice remains true.The book closes with several lists of fantasy ball teams.The raunchiest thing about the book is the title.  It has nothing in it that a 12-14 year old baseball fan could not handle or comprehend.	2001-12-13

Her strengths are present- clear characters, ample, but not overwhelming detail, and a sincere affection.However, I found the structure of this otherwised fine book disorienting.  Unlike Margaret Atwood's _Cat's Eye_, another novel which plays with structure, this only regresses until the last chapter, a not entirely satisfying wrap-up.The strongest, most interesting character is Nell.  There is no explicit sex, but Nell's lesbainism is dealt with in a forthright manner.I want to like this book more than I do.  I am not sorry I read it, though.	2001-12-01

In Hidden Power, she gives a serious, but not overly scholarly look at the ways the White House changes marriages.  It seems to make decent marriages better, and fractures marginal ones.Marton strives for objectivity, and comes very close.  However, I found her section on the private pain of Pat Nixon to be touching, and very real.  I am not a Republican.  I have more empathy now for Pat Nixon.  I admired her, but had no idea.The chapter about the Kennedys is well written, and not sensationalized at all.This is a well-written piece of medium-weight journalism.	2001-12-01

There is much less self pity in The Catsitters.  There are a few similarities- both Bridget and Johnny are on the prowl for love in a big city, they are both funny, but that's about all the similarities.As a forty something single man, I could, and did, wince ruefully a few times.  However, Johnny triumphs in the end, winding up with a very suitable woman.The last subplot centers on a play Johnny wrote, about a men's anger management group.  This is a very thought provoking topic, and Wolcott handles it deftly and tartly.   Wolcott is indeed a clear observer of contemprary American life.If there is a film adaptation, it may turn into a very good movie.	2001-11-17

They both write very very good prose, and they both write about hunger other than the visceral.  However, there are differences.  At times, Fisher's writing seems exclusionary, and Thorne's never does.To clear up a point of potential confusion: &quot;Matt&quot; is a nickname for Martha.  They are married.  She acts as editor, and does add an occasional essay or aside.  Her contributions make a good writer even better.	2001-11-12

I have literally hundreds of cookbooks.  I come back to this edition of Joy all the time.Unlike the 1997 book, this book still has the reassuring tone of Marion Rombauer Becker, and some anecdotes from Irma Rombauer.The illustrations echo those of Ginnie Hoffman, who did the illustrations for the great 1964 edition.Others who have praised the 1997 edition say that this edition is not multicultural enough.  Bah.  They also say that this edition is too high in fat.  Fear of food!  One must have balance!  Fried chicken one day, a large, lightly dressed salad the next.Yes, there are no processor, microwave, or bread machine recipes in this edition, however, many competent books of processor, microwave and bread machine recipes abound.The typeface is easy to read, and this is just a better edition,  The voice is clear and true, and not a distracting mishmash.	2001-11-05

Yes, the nutrition information is up-to-date, and processor and microwave information has been included where appropriate.Irma is gone, and so is Marion.  Instead of being a personal, quirky, very likable book, this is a cold, efficient book without much soul or wit.Do not get me wrong.  We wanted to like this edition.  We wanted to like it very much.  Mother did not, and neither do I.Joy's place as a reference remains secure, but some of the revisions/deletions are not in the spirit of the previous editions.  The recipes may be &quot;better&quot; in this edition, but some of them have been reworked in silly ways.  One example, the tuna casserole now has directions for making a white sauce from scratch.  Irma would have hooted in derision.Irma may have also welomed a bread machine, but the people who wrote the bread chapter all but dismiss the bread machine.I think that this is the last edition of Joy Of Cooking I will use.I really wanted to like this book.	2001-11-05

I have read and loved the Nick and Stefan books, from &quot;Let's Get Crimnial&quot; forward.This is, in my opinion not nearly as good as &quot;Little Miss Evil.&quot;Nick's infatuation with Juno Dromgoole is tedious.The satire of university life, while sadly accurate, is beginning to wear thin.As usual, though, the writing is beautiful.However, the plot is a bit weak, and the ending is vastly unsatisfying.  Lev Raphael is a very, very good writer.  If you have not read his collection of short stories, &quot;Dancing on Tisha B'Av,&quot; do so, it is a treat.  Also, his novel &quot;Winter Eyes,&quot; is well worth reading.  &quot;Winter Eyes&quot; is Stefan's back story, and is poweful and memorable in ways that &quot;Burning Down The House&quot; is not.Of course, one possible reason for this book is that Raphael may be taking Nick and Stefan in an unexpected direction with the next book, and he just needed to answer some questions, and ask others.	2001-11-05

It is a re-formatted edition, with some new archival illustrations, but the text has not been altered at all.Since the printing of the first edition of Square Meals, some things have changed, particularly the potential danger of salmonella poisoning. Many of the recipes in Square Meals call for raw eggs, and it would have been a real service if the Sterns' had added a notice about the potential danger of raw eggs.  I have actually cooked from the first edition, and the recipes I have tried have worked well.It is good to have this back in print, but this is not a true revision.The original forward by the great MFK Fisher has been retained.	2001-10-28

I have used and loved Beatrice Ojakangas's books for years, and I have always been pleased with the results.  This book, Whole Grain Breads by Machine or Hand continues the tradition.I have baked bread for years, and have used all four methods, depending on time, and the state of my arthritic hands.  It is refreshing to have a bread book whre the author does not consider mechanical mixing to be a &quot;crime.&quot;As others have mentioned, the additonal recipes for main dishes, side dishes, condiments and desserts are equally as good, but a real plus is the last chapter, about baking for those who have allergies.The only shortcoming I can think of, is a lack of technique illustrations.  Otherwise, this is a fine book for home bread bakers of any level of experience.  In fact, I wrote out one of the recipes (properly cited, with page number,) to a friend who is a total bread-baking novice, and she was able to make a delicious loaf with no problem.If there was a 6 star rating, I would give this book 6 stars.	2001-10-28

However, as I expanded my bread baking, my cake baking decreased.  I found that many scratch cakes which call for all-purpose flour were disappointing in texture, but I did not feel like buying cake flour for just one or two cakes.No cookbook I have used has a perfect track record.  Some well written, well edited books have a few less- than-successful recipes.I have made four cakes from this book, and they have all been very good.  The most popular one with my friends  was the Orange Almond Angel Food cake from the &quot;lighter&quot; section.Yes, I agree that the cheesecakes are more attractive when baked in a springform pan, but Byrn is realistic enough to recognize that not everyone has a springform pan, and that not everyone wants to buy a springform pan.This book is for: Time pressed bakers, inexperienced bakers who want to progress beyond un-doctored mixes, but feel uncertain about scratch baking, and for those random cake bakers, like me. (I bake more bread, now)I wish there was a chart that listed finished cakes by cake mix-which cakes start with white mix, which cakes start with spice mix, and so on.The sidebars are interesting, and the whole book is very pleasing to read.	2001-10-28

I &quot;joined&quot; at _Accidental Tourist,_ and have read every book of hers since.This my be the last one I read.  It is well written, and rich with detail.  Tyler would be a great historical interpreter of Baltimore.However, I wanted to smack most of the characters for being spiritless mopes.I had enomous empathy for Rebecca &quot;Beck&quot; Davitch, but she was the only chracter I liked.I find it interesting that most of Tyler's women are not college graduates. Rebecca continues in this pattern.Rebecca is as endearing/infuriating as Breathing Lessons's Maggie, but _Breathing Lessons_ is a more satisfying book.Laurie Colwin's _Family Happiness_ explores many of the same themes, but in a much more engaging manner.	2001-09-16

This is one of the best.For those who ever read Diary of A Young Girl by Anne Frank, and wondered what life might be like for a Gentile girl at the same time, this book answers that question.Irene Gut's strong faith, and loving family led her to make the right, if very difficult, choices.The contributions by Jennifer Armstrong are seamless, the true voice of Irene never falters.I have only a few slight quibbles.  I wish that there had been more followup on Irene's post-war life, and on the post-war lives of those she saved.Irene Gut Opdyke's faith is as clearly presented as the late Corrie Ten Boom's (The Hiding Place), however, I found In My Hands to be a much more gratifying book.I deeply hope that this book becomes part of the standard curriculum in schools worldwide.However, adults who have any interest in the Second World War and the Holocaust will find this to be a well-written, encouraging book.	2001-09-01

Those who know of Primo Levi only know, for the most part, that he was a partisan, was a survivior of Auschwitz, a chemist, and died, a likely suicide.  All of these are true. However, there is more to Primo Levi than those stark facts, and this book makes them abundantly clear.  Levi had many interests, a lively curiosity, and was an excellent writer.  Think Stephen Jay Gould or Lewis Thomas as a passionate Italian, and you're close.He does not mention his time at Auschwitz in this book.  He writes about his youth, the apartment building in Turin he always lived in, about his experiences with primitive personal computers/word preocessors, his trip upon a submarine, and so much more.	2001-08-10
