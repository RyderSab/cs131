In fact, the table does not make an appearance until half way through.  Part of what the author does is to illustrate the impact of Earth's elements on human history.  The stories of oxygen and gold are singled out for particular attention.  This is not the book you need for a first chemistry course.  It is what you need to get you enthused about the subject, to help you appreciate what an exciting and significant discipline it can be.<br /><br />This fine series is slightly marred by a tendency to typographic error.  This book is no exception, and you will struggle to make sense of figure 15(b).  Oddly, in the list of figures at the front, there is a request that readers notify the publishers of errors in the list.  I don't think I've seen anything quite like that in any book before.  It suggests that they realize they have a proofreading problem.  Instead of asking readers to be on the alert, wouldn't it be better just to have a word with the printer?<br /><br />At 179 pages, this is one of the longer entries in the series, and every page glows with the author's enthusiasm for his subject.  It adopts a rambling, somewhat unstructured approach but is packed full of fascinating historical and scientific detail.  And yes, when the author does finally get around to the periodic table, he gives as good an explanation of it as you will find anywhere.	2005-10-02

It is very readable for the most part, although if some of the topics are new to you then you will find a few sections rather heavy going.  More illustrations would have helped here.  There are syntax structure diagrams and one very grudging, cursory sketch of the language centers of the brain, but many sections cry out for a diagram among all the verbiage.<br /><br />Pinker's lively, humorous style is often commented on but I sometimes found it wearing.  He will illustrate a point with an amusing newspaper cutting, then list a few more, then add \\"I could not resist some more...\\" and so on.  I sometimes wished he would just get on with it.<br /><br />A major problem with his nativist approach, which other reviewers have commented on, is that many examples he lists of usages that English speakers would never employ are nothing of the kind.  Most of them are conceivable and since the first publication of this book, linguists have been busy recording them in the field.  The thesis also becomes somewhat unraveled in the penultimate chapter, where he argues that 'you and I' and 'you and me' are equally correct in all circumstances, because 'the pronoun is free to have any case it wants'.  But if this is so then what has become of the innate awareness of correct usage that the whole theory is about?  If 'between you and I' sounds instinctively wrong to me and 'between you and me' sounds instinctively wrong to someone else, does that mean one of us has a mutant grammar gene?  I doubt it.<br /><br />The title itself is problematic.  'Instinct' is not a word much in favor among biologists nowadays and whatever language is, it is certainly not instinctive in the traditional sense.  Early in the book, Pinker admits as much, but determines to use the word anyway, a use that owes more to marketing than to science.<br /><br />Still, this is probably the best introductory linguistics text currently available.  If you are new to linguistics, start here rather than with Chomsky, but please go on to read Geoffrey Sampson's work, perhaps starting with his website, to get an alternative view.  As with most academic disputes, the answer no doubt lies somewhere in the middle.  Since Chomsky's early work, the nativists have toned down their claims considerably, while their opponents have made concessions.  On page 34 of this book, Pinker says, \\"No one has yet located a language organ or a grammar gene, but the search is on.\\"  More than a decade later, the search is still on.  Good luck with that.use that owes more to marketing than to science. <br /> <br />Still, this is probably the best introductory linguistics text currently available.

Gowers does none of those, although he does touch on the history and philosophy of mathematics.  This is really an introduction to higher mathematics, for readers who have reached what in Britain is GCSE standard, roughly eleventh grade in the US.<br /><br />Philosophically, Gowers is a pragmatist.  To him, problematic concepts like infinity and irrational numbers have meaning in as much as they are useful, and are true in as much as they give true results.  As a European, Gowers credits Wittgenstein with these ideas.  An American author would have credited William James.  Gowers sidesteps rather than resolves philosophical problems, thus giving reassurance to mathematicians and irritation to philosophers.<br /><br />The book is a random selection of topics rather than a continuous narrative, but succeeds because each topic is fascinating and the writing is clear throughout.<br /><br />Under \\"Further Reading\\", Gowers includes his own website address, where you can find sections that did not make it into the book.  What a good idea!  The site is as full of good stuff as the book, and gives links to further sites that will give you as much mathematics as you will ever want.	2005-09-26

Something very remarkable happened in the Greek world 2,600 years ago; the emergence of speculative intellectual enquiry and reasoned argument.  Catherine Osborne provides a readable and lively introduction to these pioneer thinkers.  She starts with an account of a discovery of a fragment written by Empedocles, to give the reader an insight into how scholars investigate these early philosophers and the difficulties they face interpreting such scant evidence.  Then she proceeds to specific, selected topics and thinkers.  So it is not a conventional, chronological account, although she incidentally provides that along the way.  To this end, the map, timeline and pronunciation guide at the beginning of the book are extremely useful.  If you want a more conventional - and more thorough - introduction, then try Early Greek Philosophy, by J Barnes.<br /><br />Osborne's tone is occasionally very didactic, and she will sometimes ask a question and leave the reader to think of an answer, so that it feels very much like being in class.  Her account of the Sophists is rather partisan (she doesn't seem to like them very much) and the reader should take it as a point of view rather than the last word.  But overall, this is a great book, with an informative text and well-chosen illustrations.  For many readers, this short account will tell them all they want to know about the beginnings of the Western intellectual tradition.  Your next step is Plato and Aristotle.	2005-08-28

The first three chapters are intended to be read in tandem with the works they summarize, namely Plato's \\"Crito\\", Hume's \\"On Miracles\\" and the Buddhist \\"King Milanda's Chariot\\".  How many readers will actually do that is doubtful but it is an interesting idea that introduces the reader to three very different areas of philosophy.<br /><br />We then, somewhat more traditionally, have summary introductions to some philosophical themes and 'isms'.  Next, Craig presents reviews of a very personal selection of philosophical classics.  'Idiosyncratic' may be a better word than 'personal' as it includes Darwin's \\"The Origin of Species\\" which would not normally feature in such a list.<br /><br />Finally, we have a description of philosophy as a discipline, asking what purposes and interests it serves.<br /><br />There's a lot of good things to say about this little book.  It is a well-written, lively and authoritative introduction.  Craig references the Hindu tradition as well as the Western and gives plenty of encouragement and advice for further study.	2005-08-20

Cosmology: A Very Short Introduction is the 139-page paperback I am reviewing.  The editorial review refers to Cosmology: The Origin and Evolution of Cosmic Structures, a 520-page hardcover.  At the time of writing this review, Amazon have the two books confused and you will find the same editorial and user reviews under each.  So if you order one, make sure it's the right one.<br /><br />Anyway, Cosmology VSI is excellent.  Laymen's guides to physics usually resort to metaphors that are seriously misleading.  The alternative is a highly mathematical approach that is inaccessible to most readers.  Coles manages to simplify without misleading.  Actually, some basic knowledge of physics is assumed, at least if you want a full understanding of what is being said, but it is never beyond high school level and most of the book does not require even that.<br /><br />Covering relativity, quantum theory, particle physics and much else, this is a perfect introduction to a vast and profound topic.  My only complaint: cosmology is a fast-changing subject.  A new edition is needed very soon.	2005-08-07

Huxley's 1930 essay is a somewhat disjointed but ultimately very memorable set of musings on vulgarity, as a literary phenomenon.  The first half is rather unfocused, as the author defines his subject and discusses vulgarity in general.  The impression is that he is clarifying in his own mind what his subject is and what his position on it will be, and it reads almost like a stream of consciousness, or at least as a draft of an essay rather than the finished article.  In this first half, he actually promotes literary vulgarity as an antidote to restrictively formal classicism and describes it as the only way to reveal the mysteries of physical being and of our bodily existence.  This attitude reflects the way his own fiction was going at the time, as he entered a phase where often quite grotesque, even nauseating, images would feature in his stories.  There are flashes of wit and the style is unfailingly elegant, but many readers will become impatient by the halfway stage.<br /><br />Then, in the second half, the narrative takes off and we have an exhilarating attack on the vulgar lapses of Poe, Balzac and Dickens.  Other writers are mentioned along the way but these three come in for special scrutiny -- Poe for his rhyming, Balzac for his lack of mystical insight, and Dickens for his handling of deep emotion.  This half is full of sharp wit.  The attack on Poe is devastating, and includes a parody - a passage of Milton, done in the style of Poe - which is quite brilliant.  He is kinder to Balzac and Dickens, acknowledging their greatness while decrying their vulgar lapses.  Of course, the vulgarity of one age is not that of another, a point Huxley himself makes, and perhaps Victorian readers wept at the death of Little Nell while the same passage is ludicrous to a modern reader.<br /><br />One test of a critical work is that you never look at the authors that are its subject in the same way again after reading it.  This essay certainly passes that test.<br /><br />Although it is available in editions of his collected works, or in selections of his essays, as well as individually in the Dolphin Books edition, this work is still rather difficult to find.  The Dolphin first edition is nice to have, if you are a collector, being thoroughly redolent of the belles lettres spirit of an earlier age.<br />Although it is available in editions of his collected works, or in selections of his essays, as well as individually in the Dolphin Books edition, this work is still rather difficult to find.

It is the search for wisdom, in the context of a religious commitment.  Ford's particular commitment is Christian, and he believes that theology cannot usefully be approached in a secular, neutral way.  One must enter into a relationship with the divine, in his case with the Christian trinity, in order to properly explore theological questions.  So this is not an introduction to the philosophy or psychology of religion, but an insider's view of a modern Christian theologian at work.<br /><br />It is a rather cerebral view.  You will seek in vain for the words 'mysticism' or 'grace' in the index, and on page 118 he says 'Buddhists might speak of Nirvana, a term with no Christian parallel.'  Really?  What of religious ecstasy, as described by Thomas A Kempis and others?  What of 'a state of Grace'?  Are such concepts uncomfortable to modern theologians?<br /><br />There is also a lack of specificity.  Questions are asked, issues raised, scope drawn (in very general terms) but it is left to the reader to explore possible answers.  Arguably, that is all a short introduction like this can do.<br /><br />Ford writes well.  Some American readers might be annoyed that British spellings and usages have been retained.  Also, the proof reading was not perfect -- there is a spectacular typo on page 88 in which the words 'African wood carving' intrude themselves into a sentence about Jesus, for no reason other than they belong in the caption to the illustration on the facing page.  Talking of illustrations, these VSI books do not always make effective use of very limited space.  Thus we have a picture of London's Millennium Dome introducing the theme of theology in the next millennium.<br /><br />Despite these reservations, this book remains a good introduction to the current state of Christian theology.rrent state of Christian theology. <br /> <br />	2005-07-31

Psychoanalysis is given short shrift.  Freud gets a brief mention, but Jung, Adler and Reich get none at all.  Not surprisingly, parapsychology, hypnotherapy and other fringe theories and therapies are also totally ignored.  This is mainstream, orthodox psychology as taught at undergraduate level, the tradition that began with William James and is current in the profession.<br /><br />The authors go for breadth rather than depth and manage to cover a surprising array of topics, and do so in a reliable and authoritative manner.  They do slip up a couple of times, for example when mentioning linguistic relativity and reiterating the old myth about the plethora of Eskimo words for 'snow'.  They wisely stay well away from the philosophical dimensions of the subject, such as the nature of consciousness.  They simply use 'consciousness', 'awareness' and 'mindfulness' as if their meanings were transparent, which is fair enough in a book of this nature.<br /><br />In these Very Short Introductions, space is at a premium and the few illustrations should be carefully chosen.  Here we have a picture of a happy couple standing atop a hill, supposedly to illustrate the difficulty of distinguishing drives from goals.  Would I be right in assuming it is actually a picture of one of the authors with a friend?  A touch of irritating self-indulgence.<br /><br />So, not the best entry in this series, but if you are looking for a current introduction to mainstream psychology and psychiatry, readable and informative, this is an excellent choice.	2005-06-26

This is very much a description of anthropology as a practical endeavor, a hands-on discipline whose theories are firmly grounded in the everyday lives of human beings.<br /><br />Broader theoretical contexts, such as are found in Marxism or Structuralism, are touched on but no more.

If you enjoy reading history, then you should read at least something about historiography, to help you evaluate and interpret what you read.  This short introduction to the subject is probably as good a place as any to start and for many readers will be as much historiography as they think they need.<br /><br />Major figures such as Thucydides and von Ranke are discussed and central issues in the philosophy of history, such as the extent to which people of other times were essentially different from us, are introduced.  Arnold presents a wide range of opinions on these various topics, but has a bias toward the politically correct.<br /><br />His style is readable, if sometimes clumsy.  The British spellings and usages may annoy some American readers.  But overall this little book succeeds admirably in its task and contains a wealth of information and opinion.  It is recommended for anyone wanting to get beyond the 'true stories' to what history really is.	2005-05-29

The Consolation of Philosophy (Loeb Classical Library)	Books	5	21	23	N	N	From Stoicism to Scholasticism	\\"The last of the Romans and the first of the scholastics\\" is a term often used of Boethius, a Christian of the late 5th, early 6th centuries.  In fact, similar appellations are used for Augustine, who lived a century earlier.  I suppose it is fair to say that the period from Augustine to Boethius represents the transition from classical to medieval thinking, and for an appreciation of how European thought evolved, you need to make the acquaintance of both.<br /><br />Boethius's most famous work is The Consolation of Philosophy.  The tone and content of the work are distinctively Stoical.  I have said in another review that Marcus Aurelius's \\"Meditations\\" is Stoicism for monarchs, whereas \\"The Imitation of Christ\\" by Thomas A Kempis is Stoicism for monks.  If so, then \\"Consolation\\" is Stoicism for martyrs.  It has been argued that Stoicism formed the rational basis for the fledgling Christian theology and \\"Consolation\\" is strong evidence for that.  So it is remarkable that the work, written by a Christian, makes no mention of Christianity.  Boethius wanted to show (himself and his readers) that Reason alone, unaided by Faith could enable one to come to terms with the most dreadful suffering.  Coming from a man who has lost status, wealth, everything, and is rotting in a prison cell, facing torture and death, it is an extraordinary achievement.<br /><br />A believer in an omnipotent and omniscient god has a problem explaining the existence of free will.  Actually, the atheist has just the same problem, reconciling determinism with free will.  Boethius tackles the question head on, along with the related one of how evil can exist in a world designed by a god of perfect goodness.  His is not the last word on these subjects -- nothing ever will be - but it is an indispensable contribution.<br /><br />The Loeb Library edition includes some theological works by Boethius, to give a broader view of his thought, and has a parallel Latin text, which is nice to have even if, like me, your knowledge of the language is slight.  Contrary to what the Amazon editorial suggests, the translation of \\"Consolation\\" in this edition is by SJ Tester.  It is an accurate translation with a kind of taut elegance that is often more admirable than readable.  If you want an authoritative edition of the works of Boethius, go with Loeb.  If you want a more readable rendering of just the \\"Consolation\\", you may be better with another edition.if, like me, your knowledge of the language is slight.

It was the dark star that ruled her life and led her to a period of insanity in her early twenties and eventually to suicide when she was thirty.  All of this can be seen in her poems and in this thinly fictionalized autobiographical account of her mental illness.  She likens the experience to being sealed in a bell jar, isolated from the world, her view of which becomes heavily distorted by the glass walls of her mental prison.  She herself seems never to have faced up to the etiology of her neurosis and she does not describe her doctors as having discussed the issue, even though, after electroconvulsive therapy and (expensive) nursing care within an asylum eventually effected a cure of sorts (in reality, a temporary patching up), she describes herself as having been 'analyzed'.<br /><br />The Bell Jar is a painfully honest confessional that captures the characteristic self-absorption and craftiness of the mentally ill.  She had considerable difficulty finding the right voice for this, her only novel, but finally hit on a sparse, fragmentary narrative style, embodying surreal poetic imagery, that is reminiscent of Salinger or Nathanael West.  It is usually the girlish voice of the novel's protagonist rather than the mature voice of the author herself, with constant reference to hairstyles and shoes and of the unsatisfactory nature of the men in her life.  Their real failure, of course, was in not being her father, and the threat they posed was that they would, as he had in a sense done, finally abandon her.<br /><br />Plath herself said that The Bell Jar could never be published in America, and when, after the author's death, it was, her mother tried to stop its publication.  The characters and events were too thinly disguised for comfort.  It remains, like most of her poems, a raw and open wound, a beautifully written and compelling narrative that has deservedly become a modern classic.deservedly become a modern classic. <br />	2005-05-01

It is his only novel that lacks comic relief, is one of only two that are not set in nineteenth-century England and is also unusual in lacking a primary central character.  London and Paris are the real protagonists in this tale, much as the cathedral was the 'hero' of Hugo's Notre Dame de Paris.  Dickens was writing at a time of great turmoil in his personal life, having just separated from his wife, and no doubt the revolutionary theme was in tune with his mental state.<br /><br />The result is a complex, involving plot with some of the best narrative writing to be found anywhere, and the recreation of revolutionary Paris is very convincing.  The device of having two characters that look identical may seem hackneyed to modern readers, but it is here employed with greater plausibility than in Twain's Pudd'nhead Wilson or Collins's The Woman in White.<br /><br />Dickens was inspired to write this story by reading Carlyle's newly published history of the French Revolution.  Those events and their aftermath stood in relation to their time much as World Wars I and II do to ours, that is, fading from living memory into history, yet their legacy still very much with us.  In many nineteenth-century novels, especially Russian and British works, you get a sense of unease among the aristocracy that the revolution will spread to their own back yard.  In the case of Russia, of course, it eventually did.<br /><br />I have often recommended A Tale of Two Cities as a good introduction to Dickens for younger readers.  This is based on my own experiences, because it was a set book in my English Literature class when I was 15 and I remember thoroughly enjoying it.  Yes, it is challenging, with its somewhat archaic language and its slow development, but you cannot progress to an enjoyment of great literature without being challenged.e without being challenged. <br /> <br />	2005-04-27

The narrative is symbolic rather than realistic.  Although, as in most of Dickens and in Victorian literature in general, the plot relies heavily on coincidence, it is acceptable here because the events are true to the internal, psychological, logic of the story. <br /> <br />After writing A Tale of Two Cities, which was unique among his novels in that it had none of his trademark humor, Dickens set out to make Great Expectations rich in comic elements.  This despite, or perhaps because of, being in a depressed state of mind himself at the time.  The conventional critical view is that he largely failed in this attempt, but I strongly disagree.  The book is hilariously funny in parts and the main character, Pip, exhibits a characteristically British humour-in-adversity throughout his adventures.  There is also the host of minor comic characters that we expect from Dickens.  And he for once manages pathos without spilling over into bathos, so there are tears as well as laughter here, sometimes both at once. <br /> <br />If you have not yet read any Dickens, this is not a bad book with which to start, although for younger readers (teens) I would recommend Hard Times or A Tale of Two Cities as their first.  Great Expectations demands a mature sensibility to appreciate its symbolism and psychological depth.  Perhaps because it chiefly concerns the childhood and youth of the protagonist, it is often given to young people to read and is a set text in some High School classes.  This is a pity because, in its dark complexity, it is more likely to turn youngsters off, rather than onto, Dickens. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-04-22

Yet in her day, she was the most respected woman writer in the world.<br /><br />This was her first solo effort.  She collaborated on a previous novel, but referred to Indiana as her first.  Some of the dialogue is decidedly overheated; real Harlequin Romance, bodice-ripper stuff.  The story however, is very strong, with constant surprising twists, right to the end.  As usual in melodrama, the villains are more interesting than the heroes, who at times make you want to shake some sense into them.<br /><br />The theme has obvious parallels with Flaubert's \\"Madame Bovary\\" and Kate Chopin's \\"The Awakening\\".  Ironically, the latter author, sharing the name of Sand's most famous lover, is more widely read today.<br /><br />The novel has many references to French social and political life, and more than a few pages which are pure polemic.  We learn more about Sand's views on French society than about Indiana's.  Some readers will welcome these as fascinating historical insights; others will regard them as annoying distractions.  The timeline of the story includes the revolution of 1830 and although this action provides a background rather than taking center stage, it neatly meshes with the mental turmoil of the heroine.<br /><br />The Signet Classic edition has an excellent introduction by Marylon Yalom.	2005-04-05

It is a simple story of tragic love, with no profound insights or surprising twists. The story itself is genuinely moving, and I am not ashamed to admit to shedding a tear or two. But Waller's writing style is very poor, full of cliches, and with embarrassingly clumsy attempts at lyricism. If you want to know what a real writer can do with such a theme, read Edith Wharton's 'Ethan Frome'.<br /><br />'Bridges' is a short story padded out to make a novella, using interminable details about loading a truck and taking a photograph.

US	48932505	R10YAWUDWVXB3K	0553213296	427012340	The Last of the Mohicans (Bantam Classics)	Books	3	119	125	N	N	Voice of the Wilderness	Like the Star Wars movies, Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales were written out of sequence.  In their chronological order, with their order of publication in parentheses, they are:  The Deerslayer (5), The Last of the Mohicans (2), The Pathfinder (4), The Pioneers (1) and The Prairie (3).  So if you want to read them in either chronological or published order, you should read Mohicans second.  But each novel is self-contained, so if you want to try just one, to decide if the rest are worth reading, then Mohicans is the one to start with, as it is his most famous work and generally acknowledged to be his best.<br /><br />The hero of these tales, the improbably named Nathaniel Bumppo (or Natty, or Deerslayer, or Hawkeye, or The Long Rifle, or...etc, etc) was the first, and remains the quintessential, all-American fictional hero; brave, noble, honest and more at home in the wilderness than the town.  He is not however, the strong, silent type.  He has a habit of launching into long, rambling streams of homespun philosophy at the drop of a coonskin cap.  Never mind that lead shot is flying thick and fast around his ears, he will lean on his rifle and expound on the different natures of Indians and whites, or the evils of literacy.<br /><br />The plot of Mohicans is action-packed, but is linear - no surprise twists, and no sub-plots - and contains some highly improbable elements.  Well, would you be fooled by an enemy disguised as a beaver?  Michael Mann's excellent 1992 screen version reworked the plot extensively, to its advantage.<br /><br />Cooper was the first distinctively American novelist and was inspired by Walter Scott, the inventor of the historical novel.  He was consciously attempting to emulate Scott but, although he writes quite well, he lacks Scott's lyricism.  And his characters, specially the women, are resiliently two-dimensional.  But he did capture the spirit of the frontier, the pride and pain of a new and growing country, and in doing so created myths out of America's past that have survived, evolved, and have sustained the nation, ever since.at have survived, evolved, and have sustained the nation, ever since.	2005-03-11

The terms 'liberal' and 'socialist' have undergone many changes in meaning over the past one and a half centuries.  By the definitions of his own day, Mill was certainly the former and arguably the latter.  By today's definitions, he would be neither.  For his time, he was a remarkably progressive, even radical, thinker.  He was, for example, an ardent advocate of women's rights.  On the other hand, his paternalistic attitude toward developing societies is typical of his age.<br /><br />The basic principles of both liberty and ethics that Mill propounds have been much criticized.  It is easy to list exceptions, provisos and limitations to them, but they relate to extremely complex and intractable problems, and with such issues it is necessary to start with greatly simplified models, on which you can build.  As first approximations, Mill's principles are actually quite good.  That they are not the last words on the subjects should not distress us.  Nothing ever will be.  Only bigots arrive at final, absolute answers.<br /><br />Mill's writing style oscillates between great (sometimes sublime) eloquence, and long, tortuous meanderings.  He is often reluctant to finish a sentence and mortally afraid of relinquishing a paragraph.  Some parts have to be carefully reread to make sense of all the subordinate clauses.  But when he is good, he is very good.  The section on free speech is classic.<br /><br />For a contrasting contemporary view of social justice, the Communist Manifesto is useful.  Like these two essays, it is relatively short and readable.<br /><br />In Utilitarianism, Mill is building on the work of Jeremy Bentham, who in turn was part of a tradition that can be traced back to ancient Greece and the philosopher Epicurus.  So if you are looking to achieve a more complete picture, you may want to read a little about those two thinkers first.<br /><br />The Bantam edition conveniently comprises Mill's two most famous works and is compact and cheap, but the introduction by Alan Dershowitz is appallingly bad.  It in no way illuminates the text and serves only as a vehicle for Dershowitz's own prejudices.  So if you just want to read the texts, get the Bantam edition, but if you would like useful editorial contributions, look elsewhere.oduction by Alan Dershowitz is appallingly bad.

In truth, this is a story without a true hero or a true villain.  The original French title is more apt because the central character is the cathedral itself, overshadowing, shaping and constraining the merely human lives that are played out in and around it.  If the story has a villain it is Fate; blind, merciless and unremitting.  There is however a heroine, La Esmeralda, and she alone of all the characters makes us laugh and cry.<br /><br />Hugo can be prolix.  For what Dickens will say in a sentence, and Dostoevski in a paragraph, Hugo will employ a chapter, when the mood takes him.  I hate the idea of abridgements and I would normally never recommend skipping or skimming any part of a great work, but Hugo is a possible exception.  The thirty-odd pages devoted to A Bird's Eye View of Paris can be safely skipped over, unless you are a bird.  Everything else is essential, or at least worthwhile.  Neither does the author skimp on the use of coincidence, and the plot relies on one 'who-should-it-be-but' coincidence in particular which is so convenient and unlikely that most readers will groan when they realize what it is.  The charitable interpretation is that the book is after all about Fate and its inevitability.<br /><br />Despite those quibbles, the novel is a resounding 5-star must-read.  It is astonishingly imaginative and includes scenes, especially those in the prison, and at the very end, that are as powerful, disturbing and memorable as anything in literature.  I will say no more about them, because I hate spoilers even more than I do abridgements.  Needless to say, if you think you know the story from movie versions, you don't.	2005-02-03
US	48932505	R1RDBLJRCLJI0	0142437204	363093333	Jane Eyre (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	26	30	N	N	Plainly the best	The title character of this novel is unusual, indeed, extremely rare - Marian Halcombe in The Woman in White is the only other such romantic literary heroine I can think of - in that she is not physically attractive.  She has neither looks nor fortune.  Most romantic heroines have the former but not the latter.  It is Jane's character alone that the hero falls in love with.  It is clear from the writing that Charlotte herself was unattractive and painfully aware of it.  Strangely, the reading public have been unable to accept this, the very element of the book that makes it a perfect romance.  The portrait of Charlotte that is most often reproduced is an idealized effort that makes her look beautiful.  And whenever a screen adaptation is made of the book, the actress playing Jane is always beautiful.  This reduces the theme to that of a rich man falling for a pretty servant girl.  As always with classic literature, if you have only seen the movie, you emphatically do not know the book.<br /><br />My first Bronte novel was Emily's Wuthering Heights, which I found very disappointing, with its heavy-breathing masochistic melodrama.  But sister Charlotte is a writer of a very different caliber.  From the first few pages, the reader knows they are in the hands of a great artist.  The heartrending portrait of childhood with which the story opens is based on the author's own experiences, and it shows.<br /><br />The book is not without flaws.  The latter stages of the plot are carried along by a series of totally incredible coincidences and there is rather more Victorian melodrama than most modern readers would care for.  But it remains, with its Plain-Jane heroine and its unlikely hero (in the end, he satisfies none of the conventional requirements of a romantic hero) the perfect romance.  Never was the power of love more satisfyingly expressed.	2005-01-31

If you get an edition, such as \\"Signet Classic\\", that includes The Spooniad and the Epilogue, then you will have three bad works of poetry to wade through, the last two blessedly short.<br /><br />The idea is a good one; a series of monologues from dead former townspeople, touching the major incidents of their lives, many of them connected, sometimes in surprising ways.  But Masters is just not a good enough poet.  He attempts blank verse monologues in the style of Robert Frost (as in North of Boston) but succeeds only in demonstrating how difficult a form it is and how it takes the brilliance of someone like Frost to pull it off.  I can see that a few of them are worthwhile and would themselves make good anthology pieces, but mostly they are simply second rate prose poems of no significance.<br /><br />In my review of Winesburg, Ohio I compared Sherwood Anderson unfavorably with Masters, saying that he lacked Masters' humanity.  But - like most people, I suspect - I had only read selections from Spoon River.  Now that I have paddled the length of it, I can tell you it is meandering, flows very slowly, and contains very little life.	2005-01-16

From Krauze's drawings we learn that the thinkers of the Enlightenment were all misshapen freaks with a strong family resemblance.<br /><br />The text, on the other hand, is very good.  It gives the bare facts necessary for a framework for further study, plus some valuable insights such as placing the roots of the movement in England's Glorious Revolution of 1688.  Names, dates and book titles are all here to give you a concise, solid introduction to the movement.  There may well be better books out there at the price, covering similar ground, but this is a painless introduction, with enough facts to be worth keeping for reference.  It would have been so much better if the illustrations had contributed rather than detracted.	2005-01-16
US	48932505	R3QBK5JXZY2ADF	0141439742	365726027	Oliver Twist (Penguin Classics)	Books	4	45	54	N	N	Little Orphan Oliver	Oliver Twist is one of Dickens' early novels - he worked on The Pickwick Papers, Oliver Twist and Nicholas Nickleby simultaneously - and one of his best loved. It has what you would expect from him: memorable characters, evocative descriptions, melodrama, pathos (more often bathos) and a plot that relies on completely incredible coincidences. These latter are sometimes explained away by the characters themselves as being ordained by Fate, benign or otherwise, and must have been more acceptable to a Victorian readership than to one of the present day, who are likely to groan at each 'who should it be but' revelation.<br /><br />The crossovers with Pickwick and Nickleby are noticeable. For example, The Artful's court appearance is clearly intended to be as funny as Sam Weller's, although it pales by comparison.<br /><br />The most famous character is of course Fagin, and Dickens' casual anti-Semitism in his treatment of him is another thing that might discomfit the modern reader. He references him as The Jew, always in a derogatory manner. That this is a reflection of contemporary attitudes can be seen from Scott's Ivanhoe, in which Jewish characters are treated with similar hostility and contempt. But it is not the main characters that are most successful - and especially not the title character himself, who is innocent and bland beyond belief - but the supporting cast; Mr. Bumble and his lady, the servants in the house that gets burgled, the old bachelor who keeps threatening to eat his own head, and many others. They make the book a delight.<br /><br />As always, Dickens is the master of descriptive narrative and he conjures a grim and compelling view of Victorian London's underside.<br /><br />If you have not yet read any Dickens, this is not a bad book with which to start, although for younger readers (teens) I would recommend Hard Times as their first. Either book will probably leave you, like Oliver, wanting more.	2005-01-14

Hardin begins his narrative by acknowledging that he is very much a product of a particular time and place, a particular culture.  He does not see any reason why he should attempt to transcend that, let alone apologize for it.  He accepts himself for what he is and expects everyone else to do the same.  He is above all a man of violence, ready and able to resolve all conflicts with physical - if necessary, deadly - force.  Raised in Reconstruction Texas, he finds plenty to fuel his resentment, including carpetbagger politicians from the north and newly emancipated slaves appointed as police officers (an unquestioning racialism was part of his heritage).  Nor is it in his nature to run from a fight.  When he hears that Wild Bill Hickok, then Marshall of Abilene, has threatened to kill him if he ever sets foot in the town, what does he do?  Goes immediately to Abilene of course, to face him.  I would have been inclined to go anywhere but.<br /><br />Tough, fearless, uncompromising and cunning (at one point, he pretends to cry, in order to throw his captors off-guard) with an uncontrollable temper, he became the most formidable gunfighter of the Old West.  How many men he killed no one knows for sure. Not even he knew.  It was at least 20, probably 40 or more.<br /><br />His life story has the strengths and weaknesses common to all autobiographies:  it is the authentic voice, but it tells us a selective and heavily slanted story.  It remains an invaluable primary source and should be required reading for anyone seriously interested in the history of the American West.  Although not great literature, it is well written.  The Western Frontier Library edition is good, with a useful introduction and postscript, but I would have liked a few footnotes, to save me having to go online for explanations of 'headright' and 'galluses', etc.	2005-01-11
US	48932505	R2JGAR6YH6PKE7	0140441379	8490560	The Nibelungenlied: Prose Translation (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	60	61	N	N	From Attila to Tolkien	Wagner's operas and Tolkien's tales are modern incarnations of legends that have evolved in the European consciousness for centuries, in much the same way as the Arthurian cycle of stories.  The Nibelungenlied (Song of the Nibelungs), which dates from around 1200 CE and probably originated in Austria, is one of the best known and most significant versions of those legends.  It takes as its main theme the life and death of the hero Siegfried and the revenge of his widow Kriemhild.  It also incorporates characters and events based on the lives of Atilla the Hun and Theodoric the Great.<br /><br />This is a valuable insight into how literature evolved in Medieval Europe.  If you are a Wagner or Tolkien fan, or a lover of epic fantasy, you will want to read it, both for historical interest and for the beauty and strangeness of some of the imagery.  The inconsistencies in its plot and characterizations are a consequence of the poet trying to merge contradictory sources and also to present a version of pagan legends that would be acceptable to a Christian audience.  The result is sometimes awkward but always interesting.<br /><br />A.T Hatto's Penguin edition is definitely the one to get.  There is a brief forward, then the story itself, and then more than 100 pages of editorial, giving you a glossary of character's names, the history of the poem, etc, etc.  Probably more than you ever wanted to know about medieval German literature.  (Although, having said that, it is odd that there is no mention of the Volsung Saga, which is really needed to complete the picture).<br /><br />This is a lively, readable and authoritative prose translation.  If, like me, your medieval German is less than fluent and likely to remain so, then this is the version to read.	2004-12-12

America wanted its own Walter Scott, its own in-house novelist, and at the same time it was busy mythologizing the Revolution.  So Cooper and \\"The Spy\\" were opportune.  He was consciously attempting to emulate Scott but, although he writes quite well, he lacks Scott's lyricism.  Also, he was not yet into his stride as a storyteller and so, for example, conflicts are resolved too soon and sub-plots remain undeveloped.<br /><br />Although \\"The Spy\\" was inspired by ('Based on' is too strong a characterization) events surrounding the Major Andre affair, the connection is tenuous, and even though real historical characters, including a most implausible George Washington, make an appearance, the historical accuracy is slight.  It is a version of events that the American public wanted to hear.  Probably it still is.  In fact, Mel Gibson will probably one day expunge all vestiges of authenticity from it and turn it into a movie.<br /><br />It is interesting to note the discussion on slavery that takes place between the British and American protagonists, and also the author's treatment of the black characters.  Written between the Revolution and the Civil War, it reflects the attitudes of its time.<br /><br />If you do decide to read it, I recommend the Penguin edition, as it has a very good introduction.	2004-11-11

This collection contains his best-known stories and is a good place for newcomers to his work to start.  Personally, I think his full-length novel \\"The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath\\" is the best thing he wrote and I would recommend you read that if you find you enjoy the stories here.<br /><br />Thematically, his range is rather narrow; he developed a mythos involving primordial beings that lurk in Earth's depths and occasionally intrude into the present world.  Almost all his work is a variation on that.  Oddly (and ironically, given his name) erotic or romantic elements are entirely absent from his writing.  It is as if he were asexual.  His great strength is in his style, which is unfailingly elegant and has a musical quality to it.  He was a great Anglophile and often employs British English spellings and usages.  He is a pleasure to read, and has a unique voice and vision.  All lovers of fantasy or horror fiction, or of fine writing, should sample Lovecraft.	2004-09-30

It may seem petty to complain about the omission of one logician in a book that covers such a vast scope in such little space, but really the absence of a key figure like George Boole is very strange.  However, the book remains a great summary and overview.  It introduces many important ideas and thinkers, is fun and readable and will help you decide if you want to pursue the subject further.  If you do, the reading list at the end will steer you in the right direction.  If you are completely new to the subject, I would not actually recommend this as your very first book.  Ironically enough, you would be better starting with an elementary text on Boolean algebra, to show you some formal logic in action.  Then you would get more out of this present work, the great strength of which is that it provides a historical and conceptual framework for further study.	2004-09-19

Alan Fedrick inspires such confidence.  His is a scholarly, readable prose translation, adequately but not overwhelmingly annotated.  Beroul's account of the Tristan and Yseult legend (in others, the lovers' names appear variously as Tristram, Isolde, Iseut, etc.) is the oldest extant version, although it now exists only in fragmentary form.  Its fascination lies partly in that it belongs to an older form of storytelling, with quite different conventions from modern forms.  So be prepared for characters dying more than once, events occurring out of sequence, and plenty of unapologetic author intervention.  Some of the plot elements are wonderful, and have been borrowed and reworked ever since, by Shakespeare and others.  Some have become interwoven with the Arthurian cycle.  Read this if you are interested in seeing how the art of fiction has evolved in Europe through the ages, or if you enjoy fables that have a folksy (and sometimes vulgar) flavor.	2004-08-15

All the characters speak with the same voice.  The story leads nowhere and says nothing.  The many fantasy elements are used not to illuminate truths, which good fantasy can do, but as an excuse for implausibility and incoherence.  The one saving grace of the novel is the affectionate description of some aspects of Los Angeles history and geography.  The passages about Mount Lowe are fascinating to anyone who lives here.  But if I want to learn more about my adopted city I'll look to a guidebook rather than a third-rate fantasy thriller.  There is no doubting Bradbury's greatness.  How sad that he now feels able to reel off routine dross like this.	2004-08-15

He grew up in a tough neighborhood and, if he had come knocking on my door trying to convert me, I would have been careful how I argued with him.  In truth, what seemed shocking at the time seems almost puritanical today.  His hero, Mike Hammer, continually declines offers of sex from beautiful women on the grounds that it would be morally wrong.  His is an Old Testament, vengeful, eye-for-an-eye morality, doling out death as the wages of sin.  Even the title of one of these stories, \\"Vengeance is Mine\\", has a biblical ring to it.<br />Hammer was based on a comic book character Spillane had created, and the stories have the simplicity, directness and lack of literary pretension that one would expect from such a pedigree.  Spillane found a marketable formula and stuck with it and all three of these stories are similar in many ways.  The post-war reading public wanted a hero who righted wrongs simply and neatly, with fist and gun and no due process.  Notice that all three titles have a first-person pronoun in them; Spillane invites you to become your fantasy macho hero for a while.<br />Racier stories and more skilful plotting are now available from other authors, but Spillane is still worth a look, if only to see how the genre evolved after Chandler and Hammett.  One reason his work has survived (although he is not very widely read now) is the success of the excellent film noir adaptation of \\"Kiss Me Deadly\\", the star of which, Ralph Meeker, was a very fine actor.  Watch that movie, read at least one story from this collection, then move on to better things.	2004-07-15

There are few first hand accounts of the American Revolutionary War and of those few, Martin's is the most famous. And justly so. It offers many insights into the attitudes of the day, for example when he describes the enmity that existed between the 'Yankees', such as himself, and the Pennsylvanians with which he served and says that he would as happily serve with a tribe of Western Indians as with those 'southerners'. Such comments remind us how concepts of race and nationhood evolve through the generations. There is much humour too, sometimes rather grim, such as the description of the 'tricks' that the men play on an unpopular officer, that come close to killing him. If the common soldiers' greatest enemies were hunger, cold and disease, it seems that the officers' greatest enemies were sometimes the men they commanded. It is important to remember that these are the memoirs of a man writing late in life about events in his youth, events that had already become mythologized. Half a century and a strong patriotic sense take their toll on objectivity. So this personal narrative is not a substitute for a sober academic history; it is an essential adjunct. And a damn fine read.	2004-07-06

As much as there is condemnation of the incompetence and war mongering of the officer class, there is praise for the comradeship, courage and sacrifice of the common soldier.  This ambivalence was reflected in the reaction of later generations of Germans.  Some have seen him as unpatriotic, others as being justly critical of a corrupt regime that betrayed and misled the nation's brave youth.  It may have done as much to prepare Germany for World War II as it did to deter it.  Whatever your view, this work is a fascinating primary historical source.  We learn, for example, that the German troops laughed when they first saw tanks, though they soon learned to take them seriously.  Also of interest is the reference to trenching tools being more effective than bayonets in hand-to-hand combat.  The book is full of insights like that.<br />The enemy in the narrative is usually the French.  For a view from the other side, &quot;Under Fire&quot; by Henri Barbusse is highly recommended.  Barbusse is a better writer than Remarque and it is a pity that his great work seems to have become sadly neglected in recent times.	2004-05-14

Cody: Known as Buffalo Bill, The Famous Hunter, Scout, and Guide	Books	4	20	20	N	N	An Authentic Voice	Autobiographies are at the same time the best and the worst sources of life stories.  You get the authentic voice, but that voice tells you only what it wants you to believe.  Both these characteristics are particularly strong here because Cody's voice is such a distinctive one and because of his status as a supreme self-promoter.  So this book will not give you the whole truth and nothing but the truth, but it will give you a real insight into the mind of a man who in many ways epitomizes the culture of the historic American West.  Some of it may shock you; Cody describes how he shot a mule who had annoyed him by running away, and boasts of how he scalped his fallen enemies.  Hardly the stuff of popular myth.  If you want to know how the west was really won, then reading this book (some of it 'between the lines') will tell you much.	2004-04-19

Being written for young people, Standing Bear's account of his Lakota childhood is necessarily sanitized and romanticized.  Its focus is on the domestic life of his people.  Mention is often made of the courage of the warriors but there is no description of any military action.  An incident is related of an enemy warrior stumbling into the village.  We are told that he was well treated and quickly released.  It is hard to believe that that was typical treatment of an enemy.  Similarly, the more adult themes of courtship and sexuality are largely ignored.  What we are left with is a treasure trove of homely detail: how cooking was accomplished in the absence of metal pots, how the boys caught turtles in the creek, what games they played.  This is the very warp and weft of everyday life that gets left out of the broad-sweep histories that concentrate on great battles and famous lives.<br /> Standing Bear may not always be totally reliable, any more than any other commentator - for example, his account of leather tanning, which was strictly women's work, did not quite ring true for me.  (Not that I have ever tanned a buffalo hide - I just doubt it can be done in quite the way he describes).  All the same this remains an essential work, packed full as it is of fascinating detail, for anyone interested in understanding the lifestyle of the Sioux, and is a perfect gift for a youngster who expresses an interest in American Indians.	2004-04-11

There is however an excellent labeled diagram of a brig of war, to help the reader.  The author's storytelling skills are first rate, his handling of dialogue less good.  Other reviewers have drawn attention to the anachronous 'okay'.  What jarred with me was the utterly unconvincing vernacular of the British seamen.<br />There is no great theme, message or purpose to the story.  It is a straightforward, action-stuffed nautical adventure yarn.  The action is excitingly and memorably handled.  It is a limited theatre of action though, for there is not much to do except shipwreck, mutiny and collide with another vessel.  If you a fan of the genre, your list is probably headed by Forester and O'Brian.  What better name than 'Nelson' to add to that list?	2004-04-11

This edition of Frost's early work, comprising his first two publications, is a notable exception.  The introduction by William Pritchard and the afterword by Peter Davison are both first-rate.  The poems themselves are very fine and if you read them in sequence they give a real sense of the poet's development.  It is also nice that they are in their original forms, including the glosses that Frost later removed.<br />With such fine editing, and at such a low price, this book is well worth having.	2004-03-15

Following a series of such experiences many years ago, I sought an explanation for them.  I found references to them in texts from Plato to Aleister Crowley, but nowhere was there anything approaching a coherent, rational theory.  There were - and to a regrettable extent still are - two opposing viewpoints: on the one hand you have the supernaturalists, with talk of &#34;astral projection&#34; and are full of advice on how to deal with the demons you will encounter on the various &#34;astral plains&#34;, and on the other, the orthodox scientific community, who find the whole subject rather embarrassing and would prefer not to be associated with it.  I could find no author who understood the importance of OBEs and who approached them in a scientific manner.  Until I discovered Blackmore's book.  It is without question the definitive work on the subject.  It is a model of scientific rigor, and the thoroughness of her research - in psychology, folklore, occult philosophy and more - is astounding.<br /><br />The supreme philosophical and psychological quest of our time is for an explanation of consciousness.  That will not be achieved without taking account of the anomalous ways in which consciousness can sometimes manifest itself, of which OBEs are the most striking examples.  If you are lucky enough to have experienced them and seek an explanation, or if you are just wondering what all the fuss is about, read this book.	2004-03-08

Personally, I prefer his earlier work and his very first novel, \\"Pickwick Papers\\", is to my mind his greatest.  Surprisingly, \\"Hard Times\\", despite its title and reputation, contains some brilliant flashes of Dickens humour, especially in the earlier part.  The descriptions of Bounderby and Gradgrind, and the early dialogue with the circus folk, are genuinely hilarious.<br /><br />This is Dickens's shortest novel, about a third of the length of each of his previous four.  Themes, subplots and characters are introduced without being fully explored.  The author was perhaps feeling the constraints of writing in installments for a periodical, although he was well used to doing that.  This relative brevity, together with the youth of some of the central characters, make this book a good introduction to Dickens for young readers.<br /><br />There are the large dollops of Victorian melodrama and the reliance on unlikely coincidences that mar much of Dickens's work.  Also the usual tendency for characters to become caricatures and to have names that are a little too apt (a teacher called Mr. McChoakumchild?).<br /><br />The respected critic F.R. Leavis considered \\"Hard Times\\" to be Dickens's masterpiece and \\"only serious work of art\\".  This seems to me wildly wrong, but such an extreme opinion may prompt you to read the book, just so that you can form your own opinion.<br /><br />I read it because I had just finished \\"The Jungle\\" by Upton Sinclair, which deals with the plight of Chicago factory workers, and I wanted to compare the two.  Sinclair's book has greater immediacy.  It takes you much closer to the suffering of the workers.  In the Dickens novel, the mill workers and their plight are distanced; they are relegated to being the background to a family drama, which is what really interests the author.  A third, and still greater work, that examines the same themes, is Zola's \\"Germinal\\".  I recommend all three.  Together, they give real insight into the social conditions that led to the proletarian political and revolutionary movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.work, that examines the same themes, is Zola's \\"Germinal\\".

Western thought took a horrendous wrong turn with Cartesian dualism and it was not until Ryle's book in 1949 that we got back on track.  Or at least should have done, for the idea that we are two separate entities - mind and body - still pervades, and muddies, our thinking, whether philosophical, theological or everyday.<br />Some of Ryle's followers have extended his ideas to the point of distortion, and would have us believe that mind and consciousness actually do not exist.  Don't let such behaviorist extremism put you off.  Ryle's feet were always more firmly on the ground.  He defines the concept of mind, not invalidates it.<br />He has a lively, readable style (of how many philosophers can you say that?) and although a lot of his ideas do not have the novelty that they would have had half a century ago, this is still the best book with which to begin an investigation of the nature of mind and consciousness.	2004-01-26

This was my third Twain novel, after Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.  Although this is a much later work, the similarities are striking: the contrived plot (we have to believe that two babies, entirely unrelated and one with some African heritage, are so alike that even their father cannot tell them apart), the device of having a male character disguise himself as a woman, the cruel treatment by a boy of his adoptive parents, and so on.<br />&quot;Pudd'nhead Wilson&quot; is Twain's shortest novel and shows signs of having been pruned.  Some characters, -- Rowena, for example -- play a significant part early on, then disappear.  Wilson himself plays no part throughout most of the story.  My guess is that Twain originally intended a much longer novel, with more incidents and secondary plotlines.<br />The fingerprint aspects of the story will seem quaint, and often downright inaccurate, to the modern reader, but at the time they must have been quite startling.  The technique had not yet been officially adopted by law enforcement.  Some of you may remember an episode of &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot; in which Hannibal learns about fingerprinting from this book.<br />A (perhaps the chief) delight of the book is the selection of aphorisms from &quot;Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar&quot;, appended to each chapter heading.  It's a great excuse for Twain to peddle some marvelous quotables.  Every reader will choose a favorite; mine is &quot;Let us endeavor so to live that when we come to die, even the undertaker will be sorry&quot;.<br />The Bantam Classics edition has a very poor introduction by Langston Hughes, consisting mostly of a plot synopsis (fine if you want to remove all suspense from your reading experience) padded out with generous quotations from the text.  Some editorial notes would have been nice too, to help out with a few unfamiliar phrases; this novel is after all more than a hundred years old.  I'm sure there must be better editions out there.	2004-01-25

One of the elements that makes \\"Jane Eyre\\" a perfect romance is that Jane is physically unattractive, just as the author Charlotte Bronte perceived herself to be. In Collins' novel also, the heroine's plainness makes her a more sympathetic character.<br /><br />Britain produced some great Victorian novelists and Collins is one of them. He is a superb stylist, making this book a pleasure to read. It does however, suffer from the 'curse of the coincidence', requiring the reader to believe that the hero just happens to be in the right place at the right time to meet the right person, not once but repeatedly. In fact the opening episode contains a coincidence so great that I almost gave up on the book there and then. Despite this clumsy plotting, the story contains much that is good, not least one of the most memorable villains in all literature. I find the hero himself rather exasperating. He hesitates and dithers, insisting always on being the perfect English gentleman while the evil foreigners run rings round him. I kept wanting to grab him by the shoulders and shake some sense into him.<br /><br />British novels, probably more than those of any other culture, are notable for their character portraits. \\"The Woman in White\\" is a fine example of that, as well as being wonderfully atmospheric. By common consent, this and \\"The Moonstone\\" are the author's two worthwhile works, so if you enjoy one you can go on to read the other, and be satisfied that you have 'done' Collins.	2004-01-20

This gives the story all the intensity and focus of a first-person account, but enables the author to use a more articulate voice than his subject would have been capable of.  Few novelists have employed this technique in such an uncompromising way.  We are with Thomas every breath, every step.  I think few readers will get to like him, any more than Wright himself does, but we get to know and understand him.  He is a product of 1930s America, of deeply ingrained racial prejudice and extreme economic disparity.  Wright does not suggest that this excuses Bigger, only that it explains him.  The writing style is lean and muscular, sparse and direct.  We are given only bare descriptions as Wright allows action and dialogue to carry the story.<br />It is worth dealing with a couple of criticisms posted by other reviewers: firstly, the wooden axe handle does not survive the fire; we are told specifically that only the metal axehead remains.  Secondly, it is entirely plausible that, in his panic, Bigger did not think to hide under the bed.  Indeed, depending on the style of bed, it may not have been possible.  The plot is actually quite sound, the only really implausible element being the gathering of the entire cast of characters in the prison cell, something Wright himself acknowledged could not happen in reality but for which he allowed himself dramatic license.  It is true though, that the final phase goes on too long and the long diatribes from Max are unconvincing.  Another socialist writer, Upton Sinclair, suffered from the same tendency to preach instead of relying on the story to carry the message.  Despite these reservations, &quot;Native Son&quot; remains an important social commentary and a forceful and compelling portrait of a lost soul.	2004-01-19

In this work addressed to himself (he originally entitled it &quot;To Myself&quot; and it later came to be known as the &quot;Meditations&quot;) he distills the essence of Stoicism, one of the most important and influential schools of classical philosophy.  The Staniforth translation combines elegance and clarity, and the introduction and notes are excellent, so the Penguin edition is probably the one to go for, although some reviewers here seem to favor the Hays translation, which looks to be more direct and colloquial.  Staniforth argues persuasively that Stoicism formed the rational basis for the fledgling Christian theology.  (Interestingly, there is one, rather disparaging, reference to Christians in the text, which I suppose illustrates how significant the movement had become, a century after the death of its founder.  Many scholars believe this to be an interpolation by a later author).  Indeed, the similarity of this work to the late medieval &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot; is striking.  Part of the fascination of &quot;Meditations&quot; lies, of course, in the fact that Marcus was emperor of Rome, the greatest power on Earth at that time.  We thus get an insight into the mind of an important historical character.  This also means that much of what occupied him is hardly relevant to you or me.  How many of us are plagued with sycophantic courtiers, or need to remind ourselves that the adulation of the mob may be short-lived?  Yet it is clear that, despite all his power and privilege, Marcus was a troubled and pensive soul.  One might say that &quot;Meditations&quot; is Stoicism for monarchs, whereas &quot;The Imitation&quot; is Stoicism for monks.  If you enjoy one of those books, the chances are you will enjoy the other.	2004-01-14

If you are new to Allingham's Campion stories this is not a good place to start, partly because it is so atypical of the series and also because the array of minor characters that flit through the pages, and which will be familiar to readers of previous Campion books, can be rather bewildering for the newcomer.<br />Written in 1952, the story is interesting for its insight into aspects of life in post-war London.  Some of the references, and much of the slang, will be lost on young, and non-British, readers.  It will also perpetuate the myth of London being permanently fogbound.  Present-day London hardly ever experiences fog, but in the fifties, when it was still an industrial city and suffered heavy smogs, it was commonly known as 'The Smoke', hence the book's title.<br />In truth, the author's grasp of underworld culture is somewhat shaky.  She doesn't get the language or the behavior quite right.  She was from the rural English midlands and from a different social class, so this is very much an outsider's view.<br />The intriguing story and the intense drama are what make this book worthwhile.  It is well written and one episode, Lugg's driving through the fog, is hilarious.  He wonders aloud at one stage whether he is approaching a traffic island or the side of a bank building.  The villain, Havoc, is memorable.  Oddly, there is no one, central hero.  That role is shared between three or four characters.  Campion himself is incidental.<br />My one complaint about the plot is that it relies on a very remarkable coincidence, which is something that always undermines credibility.  But if you are willing to accept it (and remarkable coincidences do occur in real life) then you can relax and enjoy this first-rate thriller.<br />If you do enjoy \\"Tiger in the Smoke\\", you might also like Graham Greene's \\"Brighton Rock\\", which features the razor gangs of pre-war Brighton, and which has an equally memorable villain.	2003-09-22

To achieve it, the imagery must be sufficiently novel and compelling to hold the reader's interest by itself.  In Dreamquest, Lovecraft makes the task even more difficult for himself in two ways; firstly by making it clear from the beginning that this is all a dream - thus the dreamer could safely wake up at any moment - and secondly by making the stakes seem very modest.  In most fantasy tales, the fate of nations or of the entire Universe rests on the hero's success in retrieving a ring or slaying a dragon, or whatever.  Here, the aim of the journey is to visit a city that the dreamer once saw in dreamland and yearned to enter.  Hardly the stuff of dramatic tension.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Dreamquest succeeds magnificently, purely with the strangeness and poetic beauty of its imagery.  Despite the manner in which the publishers promote this book, it is not a collection of horror stories.  They are fantasies.  The title story is a fine prose-poem that will live with you and very likely encroach on your dreamland long after you read it.<br /><br />Clearly, Lovecraft was extremely introverted and introspective.  There are references in the story to those perilous places where dreamland and reality meet, and where insanity threatens.  The destruction of the individual may be at stake in too ambitious a dreamquest, even if the future of mankind is not.<br /><br />Although some passages have a light touch, the story lacks the humor that Tolkien, for example, brings to his work.  Also, there is no erotic element -- not even a single female character.  Ironically enough, considering his name, Lovecraft appears to have had little or no sexual awareness.<br /><br />In short, Dreamquest attempts none of the usual functions of storytelling.

Months, sometimes years elapse between each chapter, making it rather like reading fragments of a long family saga.  The effect is to distance the reader from the characters.  The second half is a more continuous and involving narrative, developing into a conventional social drama with a surprisingly melodramatic climax.<br />The writing is fine, with an especially strong visual sense, sometimes reading almost like a treatment for a screenplay.  The author manages a simple and elegant style that suits her theme perfectly.<br />Cather's sympathies are firmly with the strong central female character Alexandra.  The male characters are mostly insipid and unstable, and an affection, tinged with contempt, is shown toward the more submissive female characters.  Apart from Alexandra, the author's deepest affection is reserved for the country itself.  Cather writes of the Nebraska that she knew in her youth and of the immigrant men and women who tamed a hostile landscape.<br />The title is taken from a very poor and overblown poem by Walt Whitman, appropriate only in that the poem is as hard going for the reader as the land was for the pioneer.  But, title apart, the novel remains a solid rendition of Western pioneer life, a vital strand of American cultural history.	2003-08-27

Paul Drake and Della Street are like you see them on TV, but Mason is a much livelier character than Raymond Burr's rather monolithic and staid portrayal.  This Mason grins a lot - Burr never managed more than a wry smile - and freely uses words like \\"Hell\\" and \\"damn\\".

Stop and think hard about what actually happened on the boat and you should get it.  It is rather neat.<br /> It is quite funny how the courtroom procedure goes from realistic to farcical - just as in the TV series - as Mason gets away with evidence tampering and inadmissible testimony.  To enjoy a Perry Mason story you just have to tolerate those liberties.  Good, light reading for the beach, poolside or cruise.	2003-08-24

And certainly it is both those things.  It is the best known and best loved of the \\"Erotici Graeci\\", or Greek love stories, that date from the early centuries of the Common Era.  It is characteristic of the genre, featuring as it does pirates, supernatural events and some highly implausible plot elements.<br />The Penguin Classics edition has an excellent translation, introduction and notes by Paul Turner.<br />The story includes the curious conceit, common in folk tales, that an infant of aristocratic parentage, raised by peasants, will grow up exhibiting all the innate qualities of nobility, like cuckoo chicks raised in another bird's nest.  Nature is all; nurture is nothing.  This idea can be found in literature until at least late in the nineteenth century.  To (most) modern readers it seems ludicrous.  In comparison, the belief in Pan and the Muses appears quite reasonable.<br />Historians and archeologists can tell us much about ancient civilizations, except for the most interesting thing of all; what were these people really like?  Novels, drama and poetry give us glimpses into their very hearts and minds.  We learn about their relationships between each other and between themselves and their gods.  Sometimes we wonder at how alien and strange they appear; at others we are struck at how much like us - like people always, everywhere - they are.  Some things never change.  Among them are the pains and joys of young love.  For as long as there are young lovers, there will be \\"Daphnis and Chloe\\".	2003-08-10

Personally, I find his style overly ornate and often as impenetrable as the jungle - and as turbid as the waters - of the Congo basin in which this story is set.  For example, \\"We could not understand because we were too far and could not remember because we were travelling in the night of first ages, of those ages that are gone, leaving hardly a sign - and no memories.\\"  Quite so.  I was not in the least surprised to learn that English was not his native language.<br />Heart of Darkness began as a short story and in essence remains one, despite being subsequently padded out and passed off as a novella.  It lacks the development of character, theme or plot that would qualify it as a novel.  What Apocalypse Now (Coppola's film, based on this book) did was to show how those elements could be developed.<br />So what does Heart of Darkness have to offer?  Authenticity, for one thing.  The story is based closely on Conrad's actual experience and it shows.  The river, the steamer, the jungle are all palpably real, as is the author's disgust at the treatment of the natives.  This latter element has led many liberal-minded readers to see this book as an indictment of colonialism.  But Conrad's sympathy for the Africans is curiously detached.  They remain distant, exotic creatures and their plight is presented as if it were a deplorable case of animal cruelty.<br />The story's structure is interesting.  It begins and ends on a boat in the Thames estuary, where one of the passengers - after having made the very intriguing parallel between the Roman invaders of two millennia ago, sailing up the Thames for the first time, into the dark continent of Britain, with that of the European colonists entering Africa - relates the story of his adventure in the Congo.<br />With Conrad's style being so much a matter of individual taste, with the ambiguous attitude toward the natives and with the thematic slightness of the work, it is not surprising that Heart of Darkness receives such mixed reviews.  I would recommend it for anyone with a particular motive, such as an interest in colonial African history, or a curiosity to know the inspiration for Apocalypse Now, or simply a desire to sample the work of an author whom many consider one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century.dividual taste, with the ambiguous attitude toward the natives and with the thematic slightness of the work, it is not surprising that Heart of Darkness receives such mixed reviews.

This gives the story a most unusual and intriguing structure.  The characters are well drawn, distinct without being overstated.  There is also a fine sense of period and place, those being wartime New Zealand.<br />So why a grudging three stars?  Well, the solution to the puzzle is rather plodding; a systematic analysis of details rather than a brilliant insight.  Also there is a general dullness about the characters and their setting.  I suppose that's not surprising, given they are on a remote farm in winter, suffering the deprivations of war and trying to come to terms with an unsolved murder.  But it would have benefited from the occasional comic relief or lightness of touch that Dorothy L Sayers or Conan Doyle could have brought to it.<br />All in all, recommended for the unusual structure and setting (albeit the `local color' is mostly gray) and for the quality of the writing, which is very good, but don't expect a classic puzzle.  The author even makes one error in the solution (don't worry, this is not a spoiler) when Alleyn says \\"Only (the guilty person) could have put...\\".  Actually, one other person could have; namely the one who found said item.  I will however concede that the build up to the climax is genuinely suspenseful.	2003-08-07

If you are new to Orwell, then this is the perfect place to start.  It displays, in miniature, his characteristic skepticism, good sense, and keen insight into the corrupting effects of power.  It also hints at that underlying sense of guilt that pervades his longer works.<br />The book was criticized at the time of publication for being a flawed fable, in that the pigs, being innately more intelligent than the other animals, were naturally fitted to be the masters.  I think that misses the point.  This is an allegory of human society, not a manual of animal husbandry.  Every character and incident in the story has a clear parallel in modern history.  Now that the Soviet empire is no longer with us, I suppose the allegory may not seem so relevant, but there still exist totalitarian regimes that came about as a result of a popular revolution being commandeered by extremists and, no doubt, there will be others in the future.  Some lessons of history should never be forgotten and Animal Farm is a great place for each new generation to learn them.	2003-07-25

Priestley was a major figure in the cultural life of twentieth-century Britain, as novelist, playwright, essayist, broadcaster and all-round man of ideas.  His reputation seems to have dimmed somewhat in recent years and I am not sure that he is known very much at all outside the UK.  This is a pity, because he was a writer of immense talent.<br />Priestley's play An Inspector Calls is still revived from time to time, and it and others of his works have been adapted for the screen.  In particular, I recommend The Last Holiday (1950) starring Sir Alec Guinness, if you ever have the chance to see it.  I also seem to remember a good movie version of Dangerous Corner, made way back in the days when Joan Collins was gorgeous enough to warrant a visit to `the flicks'.<br />The Good Companions and Angel Pavement are his best-known and best-regarded novels.  Angel pavement is the name of a little side street in London's commercial district.  It was also adopted as the name of a rock group, in the sixties I think.  In this novel, it is the setting for a social drama, a slice of London life before the war and the blitz changed everything.  There is a rich cast of characters in a keenly observed commentary on the lives of ordinary working people.  Among the memorable episodes is a beautifully written account of a recital of Brahms' First Symphony.  I challenge you to find a better description of a piece of music anywhere in literature.  Angel Pavement is by turns funny, sad, pessimistic and passionate, but always hauntingly real.<br />So how is it that such a great writer is now so neglected?  Well, he committed the unforgivable sin of being hugely popular.  Every critic and academic knows that no one whose work is loved by millions, and is so easy to read, can be a serious writer.  In short, he is a victim of snobbery.  But don't let them fool you!  Whether novel, play or movie, give Priestley a try.  Angel Pavement is a good place to start.	2003-07-16

As each volume is independent, there is no particular merit in reading them in order.  Together, they present a comprehensive vista of nineteenth-century France in very much the same way that Sinclair Lewis was to portray American society, a generation later.<br />If you are new to Zola, I recommend you start with Germinal, the most accessible book in the series and widely acknowledged to be Zola's greatest work.  The Debacle ranks as one of the great war stories of all time.  Set in the Franco-Prussian War and its aftermath, the days of the Paris Commune, it is also that rarest of things, a successful political novel.  (For the record, I nominate Under Fire by Henri Barbusse as the greatest war story I have read).<br />In this book, Zola demonstrates his characteristic understanding of human nature.  In particular, he gives a compelling depiction of the profound closeness that can develop between comrades-in-arms on active service.<br />Although it is marred by Zola's tendency to repeat himself - in all his books, he tends to light on a word or phrase which he flogs to death through the course of the story - and some episodes are slow-paced, it is nonetheless a fine piece of writing.  Full of humane wisdom and keen insight, it is a moving and memorable masterpiece.	2003-07-16

During his lifetime, many critics regarded Samuel Beckett as the greatest writer of the twentieth century and his \\"Molloy\\" novel trilogy was accounted the summit of his career.  Since his death, his reputation has gone into rapid decline (or perhaps it is more accurate to say his work has faded into relative obscurity, which is not quite the same thing) and he is now chiefly remembered as the playwright whose \\"Waiting for Godot\\" helped change the course of modern theatre.<br />I suppose this post-mortem negative reassessment owes much to his later work, which is very slight, very sparse.  It may nonetheless be very profound; it depends on one's point of view.  But I think audiences quickly grew impatient with plays with a running time of a couple of minutes or less and novels (like \\"Imagination Dead Imagine\\", which followed the \\"Molloy\\" trilogy) that were eight pages long.<br />The fact remains that Beckett played a seminal role in the Modernist movement and that the recent evolution of neither the theater nor the novel can be understood without reference to him.  So what are we to make of works, fragments, like \\"Imagination Dead Imagine\\"?  The first thing to say is that it is quintessentially Beckett.  If you want to read an example of his later work, you cannot do better than this.  It lacks plot, character or theme in the traditional senses, yet it has a structure, in fact a very precisely defined structure.  It describes a dynamic image somewhat in the manner of stage directions.  I take this image - a sphere of alternating darkness and light, inhabited by two naked, fetally arranged figures - to be a metaphor for life itself, but other readers will give it more specific interpretations.  That is literally all there is of the `story', apart of course from the experience of reading it, which is what it is all about, and which perhaps demands that you are in the appropriate mood.<br />Becket took that dark, nihilistic corner of human existence, wherein we face an inane, atheistic universe head-on, and made it his literary province.  There is a very real sense in which life has no purpose or rationale and Becket made this the purpose and rationale of everything he wrote.  In all his work, including this one, there is always a curious and contradictory note of optimism.  He talks often of `going on' and `entering' as if he can never give up on life, however pointless, and that that is precisely the point.<br />Obscure or not, Beckett's contribution to the Modernist movement cannot be ignored and will not go away.

It is a tragedy unalleviated by humor, with nothing to ease the iron grip of a malign Fate.  Superbly written, uncompromisingly tragic, full of striking and memorable winter landscape imagery, with an ending that is unexpected and thought-provoking, it is undeniably great literature.  I just felt that the profound sadness of the tale somehow compromised the artistic integrity.  Edith Wharton experienced much sorrow in her own life and I think this somewhat narrowed her vision.  So be prepared for a novel that will move you, impress you and stay with you, but is not likely to put a smile on your face or a spring in your step!<br />In the same vein, look for Gillian Anderson's astonishing performance in the movie version of Wharton's \\"The House of Mirth\\" (a misnomer if ever there was).  Not always easy to take, it is tragic acting at its brilliant best.	2003-06-27

An eighteenth-century epistolary novel may not sound too enticing and I would guess that few people other than students whose courses oblige them to, would read it these days. Well, I am here to tell you that you should! It is social satire at its brilliant best. Smollett satirized English society mercilessly, but was even harder on his fellow Scots. The result is a novel that is a continual and wicked joy to read.<br />The characters are finely drawn and their correspondence is written in very individual voices. We follow their adventures as they journey through England and Scotland in the years before revolution in America and France changed the world forever. It is a world obsessed with social class, money and advantageous marriage (so why did I say it changed for ever!). There is plenty of sharp humor and a deal of profound insight into human nature. Smollett's last and best novel, it is a wise and mature journal of Mankind's folly.<br />Incidentally, the graphic description of the spa town of Bath will make you never want to drink spa water again.

The narrative is confused and rambling, often all at sea. Thus we have a first-person narrator (Ishmael) who is somehow able to tell us what Captain Ahab is thinking when alone in his cabin, a harpoon, without a rope attached, which is thrown into the sea and has miraculously reappeared in the next scene, and so on. Whole books could be written, and indeed have been, detailing all the errors in this story. Apologists have contrived elaborate and unconvincing excuses for what is clearly simple carelessness on the author's part.<br />As for the characters, they never quite make sense. If the whale represents Evil and Ahab Good, why is the latter such an unsympathetic person? What are we to make of the livid lightning scar down his side? The book is full of such presumed symbolism but it all remains vague and unfocused. Ahab having a young wife and newborn child also does not fit the man and his motivations. Queequeg, the most interesting character, is abandoned and forgotten by the author near the end.<br />Melville attempts humor but it is embarrassingly weak. Sometimes, as when he discusses the nature of whales and decides they are fish, not mammals, it is hard to know if he is serious or joking. Either way, it would be such a poor joke, who cares?<br />\\"Moby Dick\\" has such an iconic place in American literature that anyone with a serious interest in the subject will want to read it. Please do so unprejudiced by the conventional view that this is a masterpiece. Ask yourself honestly; is it really any good?	2003-06-27

The author's style is elegant and lucid - often very funny - and the interpolated poetry is fine, too.  Dialogue, action and description are all well handled.  Scott established the historical novel as a popular literary form, paving the way for Dumas, Fennimore Cooper and countless others since.  Fennimore Cooper in particular, was directly inspired to take up writing by Scott's enormous success.<br /><br />Although he has been criticized for historical errors, Scott includes a wealth of authentic detail and he certainly stays far closer to the truth than Hollywood ever does.  (Here's a thought; why have we become ever more demanding of historical accuracy in our authors, yet able to accept the most glaring errors on the cinema screen?)  The sensibilities reflected in this book are mostly those of a conservative gentleman and scholar of the nineteenth, rather than twelfth, century.  In particular, the depiction of the Jewish characters and the master-servant relationships tells us as much about nineteenth century Britain as about medieval England.  Nonetheless, it is in many ways a convincing portrait of life in the Middle Ages.  Having lived in what is now the industrial wastescape of South Yorkshire (you saw it in \\"The Full Monty\\"), where much of the action of \\"Ivanhoe\\" takes place, I enjoyed Scott's vision of a still green and pleasant Merry England where deer roamed vast forests and knights went in search of adventure.<br /><br />The varied cast of characters is one of the novel's great strengths.  The reader cares what happens to them because they are so real.  Oddly, the eponymous hero plays a minor, albeit crucial, role in the tale and the putative heroine Rowena is overshadowed by the more interesting Rebecca.<br /><br />Scott is best known however, for his storytelling skills.  \\"Ivanhoe\\" has a terrific plot.  At times, credibility is stretched a little too far for my taste.  For example, characters rather too easily adopt disguises that fool even those who know them intimately.  But you keep wanting to know what happens next, which is the essence of good plotting, and the story is blessedly free of the incredible coincidences that plagued eighteenth and nineteenth century English novels.<br /><br />I think \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" (despite what I call `the curse of the coincidence'), \\"Vanity Fair\\" and especially, \\"The Cloister and the Hearth\\" are all better examples of historical novels by nineteenth century British writers, but \\"Ivanhoe\\" is still well worth reading.  Most editions include Scott's introduction, spoof 'dedication' and copious notes.  Modern readers may be tempted to skip these.  They are well written but not essential to enjoying the novel itself.  BEWARE; the introduction and the notes include spoilers.  My advice is to read the novel first and then, if you enjoyed it, read those other sections.

Based on lectures delivered at Edinburgh in 1901-2, it is supplemented with an astonishing wealth of extracts from religious writings.  Although understandably biased toward Western, specifically Christian traditions, it is breathtaking in its scope.  Nowhere else will you find such a wide ranging and thorough survey of all those experiences and attitudes - mystical, emotional, ethical, visionary - that we term 'religious'.  You will never get around to reading all of the authors quoted in this book, so this  is the place to sample them.<br />Some readers will approach this work as believers seeking clarification, others as skeptics seeking to understand.

Of the former, Sartre's \\"Nausea\\" is a modern masterpiece.  Of the latter, I would nominate Zola's \\"Germinal\\" and Steinbeck's \\"In Dubious Battle\\" as leading contenders.  Of course, \\"War and Peace\\" and \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" present philosophical ideas, but neither is a novel in the traditional sense.  The secret of success in these endeavors is to to present the ideas through the media of sympathetic characters and a compelling narrative.  \\"No sense in useless tub-thumping,\\" said Zola.  Ayn Rand should have heeded that advice.  Her characters are mere types, employed repeatedly (and I mean repeatedly) as mouthpieces for specific points of view.<br /><br />There are three telling omissions in \\"The Fountainhead\\":  the first is that, although this is an epic tale, covering several decades in the lives of many characters, there are no babies born, no children reared.  I'm afraid a philosophy of selfishness has to go the way of dirty diapers when Baby arrives.  The second omission is humor.  There are no laughs here.  Egoism is a serious business.  The third omission, perhaps arising from the first two, is emotional warmth.  Ironically, Rand's essentially Humanist (that is, atheistic and anthropocentric) view lacks humanity.  Her heroine can only achieve sexual fulfilment through being forcibly raped, her hero's heart and soul are centered on bricks and mortar.  This novel will oblige you to think, but will not move you to laugh or cry.<br /><br />\\"The Fountainhead\\" is thought provoking, but in addition to the points I mentioned above, I was left wondering what the problems were supposed to be in relation to the architecture of the time.  This was the age of Art Deco and of Frank Lloyd Wright, surely a golden age in American architecture.  And is the era of the the Wall Street Crash, the Great Depression and Roosevelt's New Deal really the best advertisement for laissez faire economics?s?	2003-05-02

It remains one of the defining works of both genres.  The mad scientist, tampering with Nature with disastrous results, has become a stock character of SciFi/horror.  As for the Monster itself, only Dracula rivals him as a horror icon.  So the novel is important for its place in literary history, but does it still stand up on its own merits as an individual work?<br />The first thing to say is that it is not the story you know from the Hollywood versions.  The scientist is called Frankenstein and he created a man; the similarity ends there.  All the details are different.  The novel is a strange, obsessive tale, complex in structure and rich in psychological symbolism.  The real, underlying themes are incest, sibling rivalry and the self-destructive power of guilt.  I will refrain from further comment on the story itself, because you are better coming to it fresh and letting it unfold.  In that respect, the Bantam Classic edition has an excellent introduction by Diane Johnson which however, is full of spoilers.  Read it after the novel itself.  Johnson's interpretation is along psychoanalytic lines which I normally find unconvincing but in this case I think are right on the mark.<br />The author's style is always competent, often elegent, but never sublime.  She is not the poet of the family.  We are offered lengthy word-portraits of Alpine landscapes that are clearly intended to transport the readers but in fact leave them prosaicly in place.<br />Not in the first rank of literature therefore, but so strikingly imaginative and replete with such memorable imagery that it is still worth reading.	2003-04-21

There are many parallels with the Boscom affair and the kidnapping of Mickey Free, events that led to the Apache Wars and the campaigns of Cochise.  It's L'Amour's comprehensive knowledge of the history and landscape of Arizona that helps to make this book special.  The writing is consistently good, occasionally sublime; &quot;...the tips of the cottonwoods turned gold, like the sun-tipped lances of a moving army.&quot;  L'Amour is particularly good with dialogue, a skill which is sadly lacking among most Western writers, making Zane Grey for example, almost unreadable.  The only thing preventing &quot;Hondo&quot; from being great literature is the paper-thin characterization.  Hondo Lane is an idealized, 'Hollywooden' hero and the villains lack any redeeming features that would make them credible.  The depiction of the Apache is sympathetic, even to the extent that they too are often idealized (&quot;No Apache ever hit his child&quot;). The author's attempts to describe the developing feelings of the hero and heroine for each other are particularly gauche.  L'Amour, it seems, cannot write l'amour.  But, so what?  If we want profound insights into human nature, we read Jane Austen.  If we want the romance and drama of the Old West, we read Louis L'Amour.	2003-03-16

It is thus easy to overlook how revolutionary and shocking the events and ideas of this story must have seemed at the time.  Then, the book was banned from public libraries; now, it is required reading in public schools.<br />In many ways, both in theme and treatment, it resembles \\"Madame Bovary\\".  Although Chopin lacks Flaubert's scope and breadth of vision, she reaches deeper into the soul of her heroine.  Her style is restrained and elegant and some modern readers, accustomed to a pacier and more explicit treatment, may grow impatient at times.  But there is beautiful writing here, embodying rich characterizations, strong evocations of time and place and thought-provoking moral ambiguity.  An undoubted masterpiece.	2003-03-09

Sayers was one of the authors of mystery's \\"Golden Age\\", following the pioneers - Poe, Wilkie Collins and Conan Doyle - and preceding the hardboiled school of Hammett and Chandler.  She was thus a contemporary of Agatha Christie and Ellery Queen.<br />Her style is perhaps the most literary and polished of any mystery writer.  (For further evidence of her skills, read her superb translation of \\"The Song of Roland\\").  She handles dialogue and human interaction extremely well and convincingly portrays a wide range of character types.  Also notable is the occasional flash of ironic, rather dark, humor.  I have to say however, that her penchant for bizarre names can be rather off-putting.  We meet two jounalists called Salcombe Hardy and Waffles Newton, a lawyer called Sir Impey Biggs and an actress called - would you believe? - Cremorna Garden.<br />The plot is not as strong as the poison; it is too linear, with no twists and turns, although the central idea is quite good.  It is more interesting as a literary portrait of 1930 English society than as a crime puzzle.  But a good read, nonetheless.	2003-03-09
US	48932505	R3W3OBTJPJXSJP	0812966120	817315964	Riders of the Purple Sage (Modern Library Classics)	Books	3	146	163	N	N	More purple than sage, but worth reading	If you are not an aficionado of the Western novel but would like to sample the genre, then you should try one or more of the three great classics; Jack Schaefer's &quot;Shane&quot;, Owen Wister's &quot;The Virginian&quot; , and this novel by Zane Grey.  Of the three, &quot;Shane&quot; has the most literary merit and is the only one with claims to being great literature.  &quot;The Virginian&quot; is often regarded as the first true representative of the genre,  establishing as it does many of the great archetypal characters and incidents of Western myth, and &quot;Riders of the Purple Sage&quot; remains the best-selling Western.<br />&quot;Riders&quot; has two very remarkable features.  The first is the surprising complexity and mythic depth of the story.  There is for example, a Garden of Eden theme, with two of the characters isolated for an extended time in a lush wilderness.  This is so strikingly like the Emil Zola novel &quot;La Faute de l'Abbe Mouret&quot;  (The Abbe Mouret's Sin) that one wonders if Grey had read and been inspired by that work.  Interwoven with this is an Oedipal theme.  If all of this sounds a bit much for a cowboy yarn, I can only say that it really is all there.<br />The other remarkable thing about the book is its attitude toward the Mormon religion.  The hero is an avowed &quot;killer of Mormons&quot;.  The LDS church is depicted as essentially brutal and tyrannical.  This, I suppose, reflects a prejudice of the time, but I wonder how present-day members of that church regard this novel.<br />It has to be said that Grey is not a great writer and in particular, he cannot do dialogue.  In fact, the dialogue in the first few pages is so appalling that I nearly gave up on the book there and then.  However, I'm glad I stuck with it.  It is such a fine and strange story and has such a wonderful sense of place.	2003-02-27

Reading these classics can be quite illuminating; they are not what you think. For example, do you really know how Dracula was killed? Or why The Virginian said \\"Smile when you call me that\\"? Read the originals; you'll be surprised.<br />\\"Tarzan of the Apes\\", the first of 23 Tarzan adventures by Edgar Rice Burroughs, is full of surprises. The Tarzan of this book is not the Johnny Weissmuller or Ron Ely that you might know. He is not raised by gorillas (as I had thought) but by mythical 'anthropoids', a sort of missing link between man and gorilla, with rudimentary speech and a social structure that includes ritual and dance. This is a science fiction tale, a sort of \\"Lost World\\" meets \\"Jungle Book\\". Tarzan befriends and converses with (and kills and eats) a variety of beasts.<br />There are aspects of the story that modern readers will find as hard to swallow as some of Tarzan's raw meat dinners. For example, this jungle is populated with lions, hyenas and elephants, creatures that in reality never go near rain forests. We are also asked to believe that Tarzan teaches himself to read and write from books that he finds.<br />Many modern readers will also find the racialism difficult to take. He boasts of being \\"Tarzan, killer of beasts and many black men\\". Coming on a village deep in the jungle, he immediately readies his bow and poisoned arrows. When his European companion admonishes him that it is wrong to kill humans, the hero protests \\"But these are black men\\". (Correct me if I am wrong, but I don't believe that scene was included in the Disney version). This is a 1914 American novel, with all the prejudices intact.<br />It's quite well written; Burroughs is very readable. The plotting is a strange mixture of ingenuity and clumsiness. There is a very clever device that involves Jane thinking there are two ape-men, one an admirer, the other her rescuer. But the plot also requires three separate mutinies, two of which just happen to involve cousins, to take place off the same remote African beach. This is beyond coincidence.<br />So is this genre classic still worth reading? I think so, for the same reason \\"Dracula\\" and \\"The Virginian\\" are still worth reading; this is the book that started it all.te mutinies, two of which just happen to involve cousins, to take place off the same remote African beach.

Frederic Dannay and Manfred Lee, the authors of this and the other early Ellery Queen books, certainly enjoyed mystery.  They not only invented a fictional sleuth called Ellery Queen, they also wrote the books under that pseudonym.  Not content with that, this novel also has a forward by a fictional 'J.J.McC' and some additional notes by an unnamed 'editor'.  You may enjoy all of this or, like me, you may find it all rather irritating and wish they would simply get on with the story.<br /><br />Talking of irritating, was there ever such a provoking hero as Ellery?  Pompous, arrogant and vain, he makes Lord Peter Whimsey look like a man of the people.  &#34;Scoot!&#34; he says to a police officer, handing him some items for fingerprinting.  Anyone who thinks that America has always been a classless society, in contrast to Europe's class-consciousness, should read this 1930 novel.<br /><br />But is it a good tale?  Well, yes, if you want a story in the classic mould.  It has rather too many red herrings for my taste but I shall say no more, for fear of spoiling it.<br /><br />One other complaint; the authors don't trust to the power of simple story-telling.  Characters do not merely 'say' things.  They 'grin broadly' - for no apparent reason - and display tobacco-stained teeth when they speak.  The authors seem to think they have to embelish everything to retain the reader's interest.  When the Inspector orders his men to inspect the crime scene, they do so 'grinning'.  Why?  Have they forgotten that the victim's poor spouse is in the room?<br /><br />Having said all that, if you are a mystery fan you will want to read at least one Ellery Queen story and this is as good a one as any.  One last tip: if, when you reach the final episode, you have not solved the mystery, go back over the earlier parts of the book. As the authors say, the clues are all there.	2003-02-13

The 1957 poem \\"Sow\\" is a glorious celebration of the muddiness and bloodiness of thriving, procreating life, redolent of the optimistic romanticism of Wordsworth or Robert Graves.  When we get to the later recordings, on side two, the poet's nerve ends are raw-exposed.  \\"Daddy\\", with its dark and terrible imagery - \\"Every woman adores a fascist, the boot in the face...\\" - makes you wonder exactly how her father, who died when she was a child, behaved toward her.  That and \\"Lady Lazarus\\" are about as dark as poetry can get.  Not every poet is the best reader of their work, but Plath conveys her agony in these recordings in a way that surely no one else could do.  If you are prepared to probe the very centres of poetic pain, get this tape.	2002-12-03

Ralph Richardson was such a fine actor, how could he produce such a dreadful rendition of Coleridge and Blake?  His 'Kubla Khan' sounds for all the world like a master of ceremonies at a boxing match -- 'And in the red corner, representing Xanadu...!'  It's painful to listen to.  He declaims and announces rather than recites.  However -- and it is a big however -- Frederick Worlock's recitation of Burns and Anthony Quayle's Shelley and Wordsworth are superb.  In particular, Quayle delivers Wordsworth with an insight and sensitivity that is truly remarkable.  His is a carefully thought out and finely-honed performance.  If these particular recordings are not available elsewhere (I have no idea if they are) then it's worth buying these tapes just for them.  Worlock too is excellent, perfectly at home with Burns' dialect.  But Quayle's performance is of the sort that takes you to another place.	2002-11-29

One example: the Wexfords, in California, telephone home and reference is made to the time difference, remarking that the UK is 8 hours behind California.  It should of course be the other way round!  This mistake is repeated several times.  In a mystery, everything can be a clue and this is just the sort of thing a reader will take note of.

I would rank it among my top 20 favourite novels, perhaps even the top 10, along with works by Tolstoy, Dickens, Austen and others of that calibre... I urge you to read this book if you have not yet done so. It succeeds on several levels: It is an adventure yarn, with daring escapes, chases, intrigues and battles. It is a philosophical novel, raising thought-provoking questions about priestly celibacy and religious observance. It is a war novel, presenting a convincing portrayal of men in combat. It is a psychological novel, probing the nature of male companionship. Well written, absorbing and satisfying, read it before it disappears from booklists completely.	2002-04-16

What a pity that Bayard lacks the analytical and writing skills to make a go of it.  There is much wrong with this book, but I would like just to point out one glaring error.  Bayard's 'solution' depends on Roger Ackroyd admitting the murderer through the french windows in his study.  Unfortunately, there were no french windows in the study; they were in the drawing room.  The study had sash windows.  Although this invalidates Bayard's entire thesis, it is among the least of the problems with this book.  The real mystery (more puzzling than anything Ms Christie could have dreamed up) is how this book got published in the first place.	2002-01-07
