Unsympathetic as Algar is to Wahhabism, his essay offers a nice brief account of the history and core ideology of the sect. Algar also argues that Wahhabism is independent of some other movements and thinkers that other analysts often lump together with it. Notably absent is any explicit analysis of the extent of the relationship between Wahhabism and al Qaeda; this is unfortunate, since the nature of that relationship probably is what most readers picking up a book on Wahhabism are likely to be interested in.	2005-01-01

Joshi is in true militant form in his new book. In the introduction, Joshi avers that religion persists in the face of overwhelming contrary evidence for one simple reason: \\"People are stupid\\" (12). The rest of the book appears to be an extended commentary on that point, taking to task a whole slew of figures the popularity of whose ideas on religion presumably can only be accounted for by human stupidity. The range Joshi covers is sweeping: William James, G. K. Chesterton, T. S. Eliot, C. S. Lewis, William F. Buckley Jr., Stephen L. Carter, Jerry Falwell, Reynolds Price, Anne Dillard, Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, Neale Donald Walsch, and Guenter Lewy. It is by no means incidental that Joshi at one point goes off on a tangent about arguments for why it might be a good thing for humanity to die out entirely.<br /><br />Joshi's tone is about what you would expect: mostly entertaining if you agree with him, mostly offensive if you disagree, but over-the-top either way. However, as far as his analyses go, he always provides a fundamentally cogent critique of the ideas he is dealing with, which makes his book worthwhile even if you really wish he would please be just a little bit less combative.	2004-10-06

Hanson and Heath describe in devastating detail the unfortunate turn to obscurity and irrelevance taken by the new generation of classics departments under the influence of postmodernist and radical leftist trends in the university. While similar problems afflict other areas in the liberal arts, the authors explain why it is particularly troubling in the case of classics, arguing passionately for the importance of understanding the ancient Greek and Roman heritage of Western civilization.<br /><br />One cannot help but agree with their critique, as well as with the basic recommendation of restoring knowledge of the classics to the average university student; however, the authors go too far in advising that the entire university curriculum be restructured around the classics, including the learning of Greek and Latin.<br /><br />Although Hanson and Heath are no doubt correct in insisting that the classics are best understood when read in their original languages, they can be understood well enough in translation. And while the authors are equally right that learning a difficult language like Greek helps one to develop a logical and disciplined mind, this objective would be accomplished as well through increased emphasis on mathematics, which would also have more practical dividends.<br /><br />On the whole, a very interesting book, though somewhat over the top, readily recommended to anyone interested in the direction university education is going.	2004-10-01

The average person will not find a more useful introduction to atheism than Baggini's little book. Baggini spends most of his time skillfully addressing the foremost misconceptions believers tend to have about atheism: that it is incompatible with morality, that it strips life of meaning, that it is responsible for most of the bloodshed of the twentieth century. He spends rather less time developing intellectual arguments for atheism or countering intellectual arguments for theism, but does enough to give the reader a good feeling for the way reasonable atheists think. In my opinion, the only real flaw the book has is that its bibliography is terrible, leaving out most of the best and most influential treatments of atheism written in the last quarter century.	2003-09-11

Alain de Botton is one of those people who has learned true wisdom from philosophy, successfully steering a middle course between technical trivia and sappy mysticism.<br />In his witty, readable, picture-laden book, de Botton introduces the reader to six philosophers - Socrates, Epicurus, Seneca, Montaigne, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche - whose philosophical thought and actual lives provide the reader with a roadmap, founded entirely on reason and experience, for how to escape some of the deepest sources of unhappiness in the world.<br />For the reader who is less interested in problem-solving in metaphysics and epistemology (important though these things are), and more interested in philosophy as a guide to living a good life, de Botton's book will not disappoint.	2003-04-10

Having only become aware after September 11 of the extent of the \\"Blame America first\\" crowd, I was shocked to read about how it manifested itself during the Cold War. The depth of the corruption and irresponsibility of these people is truly shocking, and I thank Charen for documenting it.<br />With this said, I have one criticism: Charen appears to have intended her book to be an indictment of liberalism, and of the Democratic Party, in general; it is, however, very difficult to tell from this book whether Charen's targets are truly representative. In some cases, it is pretty clear that her targets are fringe elements (like Noam Chomsky); in other cases, Charen appears to have skimmed volumes of speech or writing to find a few unrepresentative quotes to portray someone in a negative light (Thomas Friedman, for instance -- after LONGITUDES AND ATTITUDES, he is one of the last people I would consider a \\"useful idiot\\"). This is a technique that can be turned against conservatives equally well, and I fully expect some liberal pundit to write a book called USELESS IDIOTS that does precisely that.<br />I am glad that Charen has hauled some useless idiots out into the light and held them accountable. I worry about her zeal causing her to tar innocent people with the same brush.	2003-04-01

Not having read any other biography on Mencken, I have nothing to compare this one to.

I found this disappointing, but must nevertheless concede that the book taught me much about Mencken (indeed including a couple of aspects of his thought) that I did not know before; so, although I do not consider it an ideal biography, I nevertheless would rate it a good one.	2003-03-28

Every serious philosopher of religion owes it to himself to read this book.	2003-03-04

Readers will find much information about the new creationist movement that took off in the 1990s, but will also be exposed to the great diversity of thought within the ranks of the creationists and within those of religious scientists (most of whom are also evolutionists) more generally. There is precious little critical analysis in this book, so those who want answers in the creationism vs. evolution controversy will need to look elsewhere (for instance, to Robert T. Pennock's TOWER OF BABEL and Kenneth R. Miller's FINDING DARWIN'S GOD), but anyone  interested in getting a broad overview of the modern interaction (or lack thereof) between evolutionary biology and religion will appreciate Witham's work very much.	2003-02-24

Those who have not yet studied Descartes will enjoy this clearly written introduction to Descartes' life and thought. However, even seasoned philosophy students are also liable to find much of interest in Sorell's DESCARTES. For most philosophy students, Descartes is more or less synonymous with the DISCOURSE ON METHOD and the MEDITATIONS ON FIRST PHILOSOPHY, and Descartes' scientific and mathematical work tend to be regarded as almost irrelevant and disconnected afterthoughts. The brilliance of Sorell's book is to show how Descartes' work constitutes an integrated whole, where the DISCOURSE and the MEDITATIONS are more a preliminary step in Descartes' project than the endpoint of his philosophy that we often take it to be.	2003-02-13

This slim volume contains 11 articles, six by evolutionists, five by creationists.<br />The creationist articles are atrocious, but they nevertheless represent the best creationism has to offer: (i) an exposition of the idea of &quot;irreducible complexity&quot; by Michael Behe; (ii) an argument by Duane Gish that creationism should be taught in science classrooms because it is just as scientific as evolution; (iii) the argument, here set forth by Ker C. Thomson, that evolution violates the second law of thermodyanmics; (iv) the argument by Dean L. Overman that life could not have originated without supernatural activity; and (v) a bizarre article by Jonathan Wells arguing that evolutionists believe in evolution only because of pure bias in favor of metaphysical naturalism, and that a designer could not, in fact, have created a world much different than the one we see.<br />The evolutionist articles are generally good: (i) Richard Dawkins discusses the evolution of the eye; (ii) the National Academy of Sciences offers its statement about evolution and the relationship between science and religion; (iii) Robert T. Pennock explains why evolution does not violate the second law of thermodynamics; (iv) Michael Ruse takes a scattershot approach against all sorts of creationist arguments and assertions; (v) David A. Thomas argues that the fossil record supports evolution; and (vi) Kenneth R. Miller explains why he thinks evolution is perfectly consistent with belief in God.<br />This book does not by any means cover all of the ground there is to cover in the debate (for instance, there are no selections concerning the age of the earth), and not all of the selections are exactly matched against one another in a point-counterpoint fashion (that is, half of a creationist article may be refuted in one evolutionist article, and the other half in a different one), but all in all, this is a decent starting point for new students of the creationism vs. evolution debate.	2003-02-11

Taylor's SOCRATES is detailed and scholarly, and a useful work for those who have already had a fair amount of exposure to the Platonic dialogues. However, its level of technicality is liable to confuse and frustrate beginners, who just want a readable overview of who Socrates was and what he taught. Even these readers will benefit from the first chapter, which discusses the life of Socrates, but the following chapters, which deal with his thought and influence, will be heavy-going for the average reader. As such, this book is recommended to philosophers, but really is too advanced to qualify as a standard introduction.	2003-02-11

For someone who did not pay much attention to politics before 2000, I found this book very helpful. All I remember from the Clinton presidency is that the President seemed to be entangled in scandal constantly, and that the Republicans seemed to care far more about bringing him down in any way possible than about guarding the welfare of the country. Klein's breezily written book, while it does at points dwell on all of the scandal (how could it not?), fills in many of the lesser-known details about Clinton's vision and both his accomplishments and failures. I came away from this book feeling that the patchwork of disjointed memories I had concerning politics from 1992 to 2000 had now clicked into place in a coherent narrative. I also came away with a much better understanding of why most Americans think Clinton was a good President, whatever they might think about his personal character.	2003-01-31

Haught gives brief answers to 101 questions about the relationship between the Christian God and evolution, in which he explores an unusual middle path between creationist opposition to science and materialistic interpretations of the evolutionary process. Haught's stance is that evolution, understood in even the most robust Darwinian sense, is exactly the process we would expect the Christian God to institute in order to create life. Die-hard creationists will not like this book at all, and materialists (like me) will find Haught's reasons for rejecting a materialistic interpretation of evolution completely unconvincing (though he is certainly right to point out that the data does not interpret itself), but those who believe in both God and evolution will find many new and stimulating lines of thought in this book. All in all, although I disagreed with Haught's stance, I appreciated watching such a deep thinker work through such a novel position.	2003-01-28

As one reads about the real horrors behind the rather antiseptic phrase \\"ethnic cleansing,\\" it is enough to know that this happened in the last decade of the twentieth century.

Forget THE HOT ZONE - the story of smallpox is far more tragic and frightening. Both Ebola and the 2001 anthrax attacks make appearances in THE DEMON IN THE FREEZER, but the main point of the book is to invite us to follow the heroic scientists who brought smallpox to the brink of extinction, and the sometimes corrupt, sometimes ambiguous forces that not only brought it back, but engineered it into an even more efficient killer that may one day make the Black Plague look like a vision of utopia. As Preston explains, the final suvival strategy of the smallpox virus, once we had brought it to its knees and were about to issue the killing blow, was to lure us with the promise of power.

Kimball's WHEN RELIGION BECOMES EVIL argues that while true religion is all nice and good, it can sometimes get corrupted into forms that are violent and dangerous. One can tell when a religion has become corrupted by looking for these warning signs: (i) the religion claims to be the exclusive province of absolute truth; (ii) the religion demands blind obedience to a leader; (iii) the religion attempts to bring about the apocalypse in order to pave the way for utopia; (iv) the religion argues that the ends justifies any means; (v) the religion promotes holy war.<br />While I believe these are all good indicators of trouble to come, and also believe Kimball did a good job of discussing and fitting case examples to them, I do not feel Kimball succeeded in establishing that forms of religion that display these indicators are \\"corruptions\\" of \\"true\\" religion. Instead, he appears virtually to assume that of course true religion is peaceful and progressive, so any deviation must be a corruption. But such an assumption is not obvious to me. For all I can tell from what Kimball has written, ultra-fundamentalists have just as much claim to be honoring \\"true\\" religion as do liberals, even though I appreciate the liberal position more. Perhaps I am wrong in this assessment, but either way, I would have liked to see Kimball offer far more argument for his contrary views.	2003-01-26

I am a doctoral candidate in philosophy, and I still enjoyed reading this book. Never before have I seen such a brief, lucid introduction to some of the key problems of philosophy: Is there really an external world? Are there other minds? How does the mind relate to the brain? Is there such a thing as free will? What is the nature of morality and justice? How do words manage to refer to things? How should one feel about death? What is the meaning of life? Nagel offers short, engaging discussions of each.<br />One will not find in this book all of the major problems one is typically introduced to in a philosophy class - notably absent is the problem of induction and, except for a side note or two, the question of whether or not there is a god.

ISLAM UNVEILED contains much hair-raising material about militant Islam - historical, theological, and political alike - that one is unlikely to encounter too often in other books. Spencer argues that the ancient and modern acts of barbarity and oppression he catalogs, while misdeeds when judged by modern Christian or Enlightenment values, are in fact true to the spirit of Islam and a plain reading of the Qur'an.<br />All in all, this must be one of the most pessimistic books on the prospect of the Westernization of the Islamic world I have ever read. I would count it as too pessimistic. Spencer's contention that Christianity is substantially different than Islam in a way that makes Christianity more compatible with humanism, secular rationalism, separataion of church and state, and all of the other ideals that make the Western world so great, appears to me to be inadequate. Christianity and Islam alike are what their followers choose to make of them, and one can find virulent and progressive strains of interpretation in both. That the Islamic world has come to be dominated by the virulent strains, and the Christian world by the progressive ones, does not indicate any historical inevitability in either, nor has Spencer's analyses of the Bible and the Qur'an demonstrated the contrary (one thinks of the \\"plain\\" reading of the Christian Reconstructionists).<br />Daniel Pipes's MILITANT ISLAM REACHES AMERICA seems to me to provide a more sober analysis than Spencer's book, taking Islamic moderates far more seriously. Indeed, one gets the sense from ISLAM UNVEILED that part of Spencer wishes moderate Islam would come to dominate, lest the humanized modern versions of Christianity lose their deep moral contrast with militant Islam and become less attractive to potential converts. Nevertheless, whatever one thinks of the conclusions Spencer draws from his data, one cannot argue with the data itself, and his well-researched book is definitely worth reading for that.	2003-01-21

There are two parts to this book: one historical, and one analytical. The first part gives us the history of Iraq under Saddam Hussein, concentrating especially on the activity of his armies and security forces. The second part examines the strategies currently available to the United States with respect to Iraq: containment, deterrence, covert action, assistance of Iraqi opposition groups with intelligence, logistical, and air support (but no major commitment of US ground troops), and full scale invasion. Pollack explains why deterrence and invasion are the only workable options in the short term, and why invasion turns out to be the only workable option in the long run.<br />Each of the two parts is worth the price of the entire book. Pollack's work is thorough, careful, and nuanced, and of course a far better source of information than the talking points one typically gets from cable news.

Earl Doherty's CHALLENGING THE VERDICT is a solid chapter-by-chapter counterpoint to Lee Strobel's THE CASE FOR CHRIST. One may disagree with Doherty on a number of points: sometimes he seems to me to go too far, as when he pushes the notion of an entirely mythical Jesus (although this is not by any means central to the case he builds, and his reasons are interesting to read); at other times, he does not go far enough, as with his failure to respond to Vardiman's absurd \\"micrographic letters\\" (against which one should see Richard Carrier's Secular Web article \\"The Date of the Nativity in Luke\\"). However, all in all, Doherty's book is compelling, providing the other side of the story for those who are not satisfied with Strobel's one-sided pretence of objective journalism.	2003-01-19

In this fascinating book, Daniel Pipes introduces us to a crucial distinction: Islam on the one hand, and militant Islam - or Islamism - on the other. Against both the common thesis that the entire House of Islam constitutes a threat against the West, Pipes explains that it is Islamism, rather than Islam as a whole, that we must contend with. Against the contrary, but equally widespread thesis that we must worry only about a handful of fundamentalist psychopaths, Pipes details just how prevalent Islamism is, and how far its reach already extends into our own society.<br />Islamism is a totalistic system, based on a fusion of traditional Islamic and Western concepts (although portraying itself as - and, in its own mind, being - entirely Islamic), contrasting itself not with other religions (e.g. Christianity and Judaism), but with other systems, like capitalism and communism. Islamism is in fact totalitarian, seeking to bring every aspect of life under the governance of its precepts. As such, while Islam the religion is compatible with modern Western ideals, Islamism is a competitor which can only seek to undermine those ideals.<br />With this distinction explained, Pipes turns his attention to the actual efforts of Islamists in the United States and Europe to suppress dissent and criticism, and build a power base that will lead to the triumph of militant Islam worldwide. These efforts take a wide variety of forms, from murderous fatwas and acts of terror, to the exploitation of Western religious tolerance and the political correctness of the Western media and academia.<br />Pipes also offers strategies for defeating militant Islam. Someof his suggestions are, in my opinion, poor ones (for instance, the racial profiling of airplane passengers, which I suspect will only convince terrorists to rely upon converts of Scandanavian descent), but most are sound, particularly the isolation of militant Islamist groups and figures that the strange PC mentality currently gives a voice to, and the active support and promotion of moderate Islamic groups and figures, both here and abroad.<br />All in all, MILITANT ISLAM REACHES AMERICA is a unique and important book, and should be on the shelf of every policy-maker in the United States, if not on every shelf, period.a voice to, and the active support and promotion of moderate Islamic groups and figures, both here and abroad.<br />All in all, MILITANT ISLAM REACHES AMERICA is a unique and important book, and should be on the shelf of every policy-maker in the United States, if not on every shelf, period.	2003-01-18

If the Roman Catholic Church manages to survive into the next century as anything other than a curious relic of less civilized times, it will be because of the efforts of brave reformers like Donald B. Cozzens. In SACRED SILENCE, Cozzens openly speaks about the problems that are killing the Church from the inside; brute ambition, blind protection of the institution (even in the face of priestly child rape, and the silencing of the voices of women, gay priests, and abused children. Cozzens' book is an important call for frank and open dialogue - a call which the Church had better listen to, before its whole 1900-year-old carcass ends up six feet under.	2003-01-17

Priest's little book has short, clearly written chapters on validity, truth functions, quantifiers, descriptions, self-reference, modal operators, conditionals, tenses, identity, vagueness, inductive logic, and decision theory. Virtually every chapter shows how interesting philosophical problems arise from or are tied in with logic. The only possible drawback to the book is that new initiates to the philosophical foundations of logic are likely to never again have a good night's sleep after Priest introduces them to some of the classic puzzles.	2003-01-15

Ansary's book is instead an unusually eloquent account of his childhood in pre-Taliban Afghanistan, his later life in the US, and his travels back into the Islamic world. However, for whatever reason one picks up the book, Ansary's life story is a compelling one, well worth following, and it is difficult to imagine anyone feeling disappointed by it.	2003-01-14

A collection of hard-hitting essays since September 11, placing blame for terrorism firmly where it belongs, pulling no punches against the insane anti-American ramblings of fundamentalists and ultra-leftists alike, and advocating sound (and now vindicated) strategy in our war for survival, AN AUTUMN OF WAR is real encouragement for those who respect the classical ideals of the West.	2003-01-02

As it turns out, the book was in fact written before (although published after) September 11, and contains mostly neutral history. Where there is commentary (very rarely) it appears equally neutral. Lewis simply describes how the Islamic world rose and fell in comparison with the West, including extensive discussion -- from weapons to music -- of what the two borrowed or refused to borrow from one another. The picture that results is one of a stagnant, rather than oppressed, Middle East -- a Middle East whose problems result largely from internal causes, rather than from exploitation by outsiders. The book ends with a sobering challenge from Lewis: that to restore its former glory, the Middle East must abandon the scapegoating and conspiracy theories currently so popular, and embrace responsibility for itself.	2003-01-02

The book contains enough historical information to be truly informative, yet also enough case- and character-study to keep the reader entertained. Cuneo's attitude towards exorcism is a skeptical one (in all of the exorcisms he has attended in the process of researching the book, he has seen nothing that indicates supernatural activity), but whether or not one agrees with this attitude, one will benefit from his discussion of the principal works and figures responsible for the renewal of exorcism in modern America.	2002-12-29

Quinton offers short summaries of David Hume's life, his philosophical assumptions, and his views on causation, material things, the self, scepticism, morality and the passions, politics, and religion, with each summary followed by a list of relevant quotes from Hume's various works. Reading this book is an ideal way to orient oneself before engaging in a deeper study of Hume.	2002-12-19

For anyone who has followed Weinberg for a while, there is nothing new here except for brief (on the order of a few paragraphs) introductions to each of the pieces; however, the essays are quite good, and well worth a second reading. Weinberg's primary concerns are to defend reductionism and scientific realism (in the senses both that science means to describe the real world, and that science in fact makes progress towards the one true description), and, in at least one brilliant essay, to argue that physics points in the opposite direction as religion. The quality of philosophical thought in the essays is not exceptionally deep, but Weinberg does offer the reader what I think is a healthy dose of common sense.	2002-12-19

We owe to Dumas's skillful hand a narrative rivaling WAR AND PEACE, a vast collection of characters and tales within tales, all finally ancohered together upon the dreadful downfall of Edmond Dantes and his in some ways equally dreadful rebirth as that mysterious agent of justice, the Count of Monte Cristo. It is a fascinating story, providing thrills -- but not at the expense of shallowness -- and provoking thought -- but without affectation.<br />My only piece of advice to the reader is to take a few notes on the characters, since they disappear and reappear, and sometimes are referred to by different names and titles. However, for what it is worth, I was able to follow the story closely enough to thoroughly enjoy it even without notes, and despite occasionally being forced to set the book down for a few weeks between chapters.<br />Because of the size of the book, the Modern Library Classics edition is especially useful, having comparatively large and legible print, decent spacing between lines, and, most importantly, a flexible spine which allows it to be set open on a table without creasing or cracking.	2002-11-13

Charles Templeton's FAREWELL TO GOD is the best layman's first introduction to the problems of orthodox Christianity I have yet read.<br />The book is divided into forty-six brief and nontechnical chapters, ideal for the average Mortimer or Jacqueline on the street, who can spare no more than a few minutes a day studying something as unimportant as religion.<br />Although Templeton covers many subjects, he places heavy emphasis upon the Bible. This will be informative for the average Christian, who is likely to have only passing familiarity with most of the Good Book, and will no doubt be astounded to discover some of its contents. In his chapters on the Bible, Templeton usually spends a few pages recounting a story from the book, and then comments upon its implausibility or barabarity. The commentaries are, for the most part, quite obvious, but their value for novices should not be underestimated -- tradition has built such an aura of sacred immunity around the Bible, that most people are in desperate need of someone willing to call a spade a spade.<br />It is important to emphasize the introductory nature of the book. Templeton does not by any means come close to offering the last word on anything he discusses. He does not even attempt to interact with standard apologetic responses to the kinds of worries he raises. There are also a handful of errors in Farewell to God, such as the staggering mischaracterization of atheism as the claim to absolute certainty (17), without argument (18), that there is no god, or the glaring self-contradiction in which Templeton denies the Bethlehem birth of Jesus in one chapter (85), and presupposes it in another (96). Seasoned fundamentalist apologists, then, will surely consider Farewell to God naive and simplistic (though they will hardly object to the caricature of atheism). Experienced infidels will likewise learn nothing new from Templeton, but they will be more liable to appreciate his eloquence and pointedness. Infidels will also recognize the great value of a forceful initial critique of Christianity: it is surely a good thing for novices not to get bogged down in endless rebuttal and counter-rebuttal during their first steps; for novices, accessibility is the key, and Templeton more than delivers on that count.<br />In short, I heartily recommend FAREWELL TO GOD as informative to anyone who has yet to read a critique of Christianity, and as enjoyable to experienced religious skeptics. Dedicated fundamentalists, however, should not read it without an ample supply of blood-pressure medicine.also recognize the great value of a forceful initial critique of Christianity: it is surely a good thing for novices not to get bogged down in endless rebuttal and counter-rebuttal during their first steps; for novices, accessibility is the key, and Templeton more than delivers on that count.<br />In short, I heartily recommend FAREWELL TO GOD as informative to anyone who has yet to read a critique of Christianity, and as enjoyable to experienced religious skeptics.

While ARGUING FOR ATHEISM is technical compared to most other introductions to atheism, it more than repays any effort the reader puts into it, as LePoidevin very clearly shows how the problems in philosophy of religion are firmly connected to other deep and complicated philosophical problems. Were everyone to read LePoidevin's book, far more people would approach philosophy of religion with humility, and the average level of discourse on the subject would be raised substantially.	2002-11-13

The selections appear to be chosen as much for their literary qualities as for their defense of atheism, making for very pleasurable reading. Additionally, Joshi introduced me to a few historical atheists I had not heard of before, as well as a few figures I had heard of, but had not known were atheists. So I do feel enriched for having read it. However, three aspects of the reader bothered me. First, Joshi's introduction is too militant, and will unjustly ward off even reasonable religious folks, who would otherwise profit from the selections that follow. Second, the literary emphasis notwithstanding, a &quot;reader&quot; on atheism really should include selections from modern atheistic philosophers of religion, such as J. L. Mackie and Michael Martin. Finally, though I do not myself believe in an afterlife, the question of immortality is perfectly separable from the question of whether or not there is a god, and so it bothered me that Joshi included in his reader on &quot;atheism&quot; a section against immortality. But with these qualifications, my impression of the reader was, overall, a very favorable one, and I believe this book should be on the list of every person who wants to learn more about atheism.	2002-11-13

Those who hold up Christianity as a panacea must be reminded of the religion's bloody and oppressive past, which is exemplied as well in the crusades against the Muslim \\"heathen\\" as in anything else. However, there is an unfortunate trend among modern scholars to present the historical encounter between Christendom and Dar al-Islam as a completely one-sided affair, with the Muslims invariably being the hapless victims of imperialist Christians. In truth, Islam has no better a historical record than Christianity, as Paul Fregosi's JIHAD IN THE WEST demonstrates.<br />Fregosi takes us through the history of Islamic imperialism and violence, from the time of Muhammad to the Yugoslavian civil war, showing us that Islam is no more inherently peaceful, and no more immune to hijacking by the unprincipled, than is Christianity. The history of Christendom versus Dar al-Islam is not a history of evil versus good, but merely a history of the contention between two equally ambiguous powers, with Christendom emerging the temporary victor. What makes JIHAD IN THE WEST unique is that these points are driven home with hardly a nod to terrorism. Look to the past, says the book, before Dar al-Islam lost power, and you will see that its ambiguous face is its true face, rather than the product of Western oppression that so many claim.<br />To be sure, JIHAD IN THE WEST tells only part of the story. It tells us about the damage Islam has done, not about the numerous ways in which it has enriched the world; it tells us about the atrocities Muslims have committed, not about the atrocities they have suffered; it tells us about the warlords and conquerers, not about the scholars and scientists. However, the part of the story Fregosi relates to us is a part too often neglected by modern scholars, in their frenzy to bash Western civilization. JIHAD IN THE WEST thus provides a much-needed balance to current trends, and is useful to read alongside of standard accounts of the relationship between the West and Dar al-Islam.n the West and Dar al-Islam.	2002-11-11

ATHEISM: A PHILOSOPHICAL JUSTIFICATION is the most comprehensive defense of atheism yet written, covering in substantial detail many variations of the most influential arguments for and against the existence of god developed up to the early 1990s.<br />The book has only two notable defects. The first is that, simply by virtue of having been published in 1992, the book fails to address important recent developments in the field, such as the argument from nonbelief, which only came into prominence with Schellenberg's 1993 DIVINE HIDDENNESS AND HUMAN REASON and Drange's 1998 NONBELIEF AND EVIL. A second edition of Martin's book would thus be very useful, but in the meantime one should be sure to read Drange alongside.<br />The second defect is that the book gives too short shrift to moral arguments for the existence of god. Fortunately, Martin has just written an entire new book (ATHEISM, MORALITY, AND MEANING) to fill in that gap.<br />ATHEISM: A PHILOSOPHICAL JUSTIFICATION can be very technical at times, so readers who lack a strong background in philosophy and logic would probably be better off starting with a more intermediate treatment like Robin LePoidevin's ARGUING FOR ATHEISM (or a basic treatment like Douglas E. Krueger's WHAT IS ATHEISM?), but anyone who is serious about philosophy of religion must commit to eventually working his or her way through Martin's book.	2002-11-10
