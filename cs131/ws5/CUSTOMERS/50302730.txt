Jake Featherston, the Confederate Hitler, has come to power in the south and is preparing for his revenge on the USA, and doesn't care who he has to hang from a meathook to get it.  Blacks are rounded up and sent to concentration camps along with Featherston's political opponents, holdouts are assassinated, and barbaric party stalwarts are given free reign to spread their message of hate.  All of the major characters from the prevoius novels in this series are back, some of them for the last time, and a few new characters take stage as Turtledove's gripping tale of Alternate History continues.  Unlike the two proceeding novels, this one is just the right length, not so long that by the end the reader has lost interest.  Also, by making Featherston's actions so sweeping, it includes almost all of the characters much more directly.  Fans of the series will love this addition, and the tense ending will leave readers howling for more.  Another wonderful work of Alternate History by the master.	2004-01-01

'Front' begins right where 'Fox at the Rhine' left off.  Erwin Rommel, whose panzers had been largely cut off from the bulk of his forces, realizes the neccessity of surrendering to the Americans before the Soviets get ideas about resuming their attack.  What follows is a tense, page turning story in which the western allies, with Rommel's help, try to reach Berlin before the forces of Stalin.  Overall this is a very believable senario and lends itself to some good 'what if?' questions.  The plot is fast paced, sometimes too fast paced, and holds the reader's interest.  And while this book succeeds on many levels, the ending seems a little flat and predicatable.  Additionally, while many of the characters are wonderfully drawn and add much to the story, others seem to offer nothing of any real interest.  Because of this, the book could have benefitted from some trimming.  Sometimes it felt as though I was reading nearly six hundred pages for a three hundred page story.  Aside from these setbacks, 'Fox at the Front' is definatly worth a look for WW II buffs or fans of Alternate History in general.	2003-12-22

In 1933 Charles Lindbergh, backed by the Ku Klux Klan, becomes the President of the United States instead of Roosevelt.  Under his naive leadership, Fascism explodes in America.  Lynchings are legal, concentration camps flourish, and by 1940 the possibility of America entering WWII on the side of Nazi Germany is very real.  Easterman succeeds brilliantly in creating this nightmare world where neighbors spy on neighbors and anyone who doesn't fit into the Klan's narrow view of the world is expendable.  But despite this wonderfully creeepy background, Easterman really fumbles the ball on the story.  He loses quite a bit of credibility describing, (or not describing), the way in which characters slip away from the secret police, meet, and escape at various points in the story.  Also, the basic plot seems muddled, as though Easterman himself wasn't quite sure where to take his characters to build suspence.  The climax is less than exciting, but by this point the reader isn't expecting much.  Another reviewer mentioned a glaring historical error at the end of this book.  That oversight only serves to again undermine the author's, and thus the story's, credibility even further.  Still, if you're a sucker for a decent AH story with some really good historical twists, (J. Edgar Hoover becomes America's Himmler as head of the Federal Bureau of Internal Security), you may very well enjoy this book.  It's just too bad such a wonderful premise was wasted on such a lackluster story.	2002-01-11

From the unrepentant, pompus bravado of Hermann Goering to the disgusting anti-semitism of Julius Streicher to the absent minded Joachim von Ribbentrop to the humbled Albert Speer, this work proves a keen insight into the men who at one time controlled an empire, but who now faced the world's final justice. Thought-provoking, chilling, and at times even moving, Gilbert's 'Nuremberg Diary' will stand forever as an important witness against Nazi barbarism.	2001-09-05

Instead of working out a deal, the US and the USSR begin a full scale nuclear war in the wake of the Cuban Missle Crisis. Ten years later The United States is a police state, where military conscription and British foreign aid are supposedly the only things keeping the country from reverting to barbarism. When a reporter stumbles onto a story about the true beginnings of the US-Soviet war he soon finds himself in the middle of the largest cover-up in US history and is soon being hunted by the US Air Force, British secret agents, and other, more mysterious figures. While the author does a tremedous job of creating this fictional, nightmare world it still doesn't hold a candle to Robert Harris's 'Fatherland,' to which this novel is often compared. It is much slower moving than 'Fatherland' and a bit more implausble in some areas. Also the characters, while compelling, aren't nearly as interesting as Harris's. That being said it should also be pointed out that this is a first rate AH story that should be embraced by all lovers of the genre. A lot of fun!	2001-09-05

Not nearly as thrilling or full of adventure as Forester's 'Hornblower' novels, 'The Good Shephard' is nevertheless a stirring tale of action, suspense, and human drama played out in the North Atlantic during WWII. Captain Krause, a character of similar attitude as the doubt-ridden Hornblower, is in command of a convoy bound for England. His foe is the Kriegsmarine with it's deadliest weapon, the U-boat. Throughout the story Krause must battle the Germans along with his own fatigue and self-doubt. While this novel doesn't quite live up to the 'Hornblower' standard (like 'Captain from Connecticut' or 'The Nightmare'), it nevertheless manages to capture the same tense feelings and gripping drama that made 'Hornblower' Forester's trademark.	2001-09-05

Edward Cooper's novel, 'Triumph of the Third Reich,' plays out more like an extended timeline with dramatized scenes than a fully cohesive AH story. The basic premise is simple enough: What if Germany developed atomic weapons mid-way through the war and exploded one during the D-Day invasion? After the Allied distaster at Normandy, confusion reigns in Washington, London, and Moscow. The leaders of all three nations are soon replaced by regimes willing to deal with the Nazis rather than face destruction from atomic attack. The writing of this novel is weak, reading almost as though it were a first, uncorrected draft, and the story jumps around far too much to really flesh out any characters or emotions. Rather, Cooper chooses to focus on the events and historical figures, showing the course the war could have taken. That being said this is a very entertaining look at 'What If?' Though some of the conclusions the story supports are a little out there, (like the assumption that Hitler would have waited until D-Day to use his atomic devise), it nevertheless holds interest and is surprisingly readable with many tense moments. If story and character are a must for you maybe this isn't the book for you, but if you love a good Alternate History senerio as much as I do you may just want to check out 'Triumph or the Third Reich.'	2001-08-29

His other book, 'Blitzkrieg,' takes an even closer look at the development of German armor tactics during that same period.  While the first hundred pages or so focuses more on the political situation in Germany during Hitler's reign, the bulk of the work, which explores the theories of such armoroed proponents as J.F.C. Fuller, B.H. Liddel Hart, and Heinz Guderian, makes for an account both unique and extremely helpful to those seeking to understand just how Germany conquered so much, so quickly, in the first years of the war.

Campbell Jr.  Nazi propagandist, racist, war criminal, and American spy.  The story, told by Campbell from his prison cell in Israel, is of his success as a playwrite in Germany before the war, his recruitment by US intelligence, the devistation of the loss of his wife, the utter lonliness and apathy that plagued his life after the war, and the web of political intrigue that surrounds him before his trial.  The style is similar to Vonnegut's other masterwork, 'Slaughterhosue Five,' in which Campbell also makes an appearence, and is told with the same wit and wonderful insight into the human soul.

Jeff Slate and David Rearden's new book, 'Bloodsworth Island,' is entertaining, though occasionally has it's flaws.  The story centers around the efforts of one genetic researcher, Dr. Gene Nolan, to understand just what is going on at his research lab, the Davenport center on Bloodsworth Island off the coast of Maryland.  During his quest he is forced to realize that the high ideals that the center was based on are only a front for a sinister group of men who will stop at nothing to see their demonic dreams become reality.  The writing style is at times weak, and often choppy.  The authors take too much time telling the story to really develop any of the characters save a few.  That being said, where 'Bloodsworth Island' succeeds is in the feeling of paranoia that it establishes.  At many times the same creepy feeling that Orwell gave us in '1984' is present and the conflict of conscience that Dr. Nolan experiences makes for fun and entertaining reading.  Also interesting are the little touches the authors include.  For instance the birthday of Dr. Gallagher, who runs the Davenport center, is givin as April 20th, (Hitler's birthday), 1939, (the year the Second World War began).  If you're looking for a fun thriller with shades of Orwell and Huxley this might be one you should check out.	2001-06-18

Dickson's 'The Final Encyclopedia' is easily one of the greatest novels of science-fiction.  The novels that precede it in the series are also all first rate works.  But sadly, the three novels that follow, 'Young Bleys,' 'Other,' and 'The Chantry Guild,' are considerably weaker.  While 'The Chantry Guild' does give some reward to the readers who've followed the series for years, it still lacks the final resolution that we've waited for, (no doubt Dickson is planning more books in the series), and the bulk of the work is just plain uninteresting.  If you're a fan of the series then you probably should give this one a look, if you're new to the Childe Cycle you might want to start with 'Tactics of Mistake,' of 'Soldier, Ask Not.'	2001-06-18

Instead of invading Russia in the summer of 1941 Hitler decides to knock England out of the war with a full-scale invasion in the spring of 1942.  Awaiting the German armada is a hastily assembled American Expeditionary Force and the war-weary Brits.  The story is told from the point of view of the American commanding general's aide, Col. Royce.  Royce tells more than the story of the invasion as he examines the motives, mistakes, loves, fears, and strategy of General Wilson Clay, a flawed but fearless American leader determined that Britain will not fall to the Nazis.  As a fan of alternate history I can tell you that this is one of the best the genre has to offer.  Stewart's spins on historical fact make this novel all the more compelling.  For instance, Clay and his British superiors have the same arguments about meeting the invaders on the beach that Rommel and Hitler had in the real war.  Also, the real-life allies' 'Operation: Fortitude' is turned into a German ruse to fool the allied armies as to where the blow will land.  The weakness of this book lies in it's dealing with the war in the whole, outside of the battle.  The final outcome the alternate World War is only metioned in passing and isn't as satisfying as it could be.  That aside, 'S-Day' is a lot of fun.  I looked for nearly four years before I found a copy of this book and it was well worth the wait.	2001-06-02

Gitta Sereny's monumental work 'Abert Speer: His Battle with Truth,' is a book of major importance about a man and an era that the world must never forget.  Albert Speer, first Hitler's architect and later his Minister for Armaments and War Production, will remain forever an enigma.  Did he know about the Holocaust?  To what extent was his involvment?  Should he have been hanged at Nuremburg?  Was his apologetic manner in later years sincere?  These are the questions that Sereny asks and attempts to answer, often arriving at conclusions that make even the reader uncomfortable, forcing him or her to realize that the Nazi system, at the time, could have held as much appeal for them as it did for Speer and for all of Germany.  Sereny's intervews with Speer, her numerous interviews, and her exhaustive research all contribute to this masterful book.  Of particular interest are the people whose lives were affected most by the madess of Hitler.  Sereny's talks with the son of Martin Bormann are both chilling and incredibly moving.  I do feel as though this book, along with Speer's own works, 'Inside the Third Reich,' and 'Spandau: the Secret Diaries,' (his thrid book, 'Infiltrator,' is one to be missed,) are essential reading for any serious student of Nazi Germany.	2001-04-26

The premise of Crichton's novel 'Timeline' is pretty out there:  Twentieth century historians working on the excavation of a medeival castle in France are invited to go back in time to search for their friend by a powerful corporation.  I've always been weary of time-travel stories as they can be so easy to screw up.  Even one of the best time travel novels ever written, Harry Turteldove's 'Guns of the South,' handles the time travel aspects in a less than stellar way.  Nevertheless, Crichton's believability factor soars as he explains in exhaustive detail the method by which quantom mechanics is applied to time travel.  Aside from that, the basic story is a little weak.  While Crichton's research of fourteenth century France is austounding, it often feels as though he's writing the story to fit his research instead of using the research to support the story.  The characters are two-dimensional and not very interesting, with the exception of the company CEO, whose cold blooded attitude makes for great conflict.  If you're a fan of Crichton you should enjoy 'Timeline.'  Fans of the techno thriller may also enjoy Leonard Crane's 'Ninth Day of Creation,' which is written in a similar style but gives the reader better developed characters and a more interesting plot.	2001-04-26

'Fox on the Rhine,' by Douglas Niles and Micheal Dobson, is a wonderful story of just how differently World War Two could have turned out if the Army Officers plot had succeeded in killing Adolf Hitler.  In 'Fox' Hitler is killed at Rastenberg on July 20th, 1944 and Germany is soon thrown into a sea of chaos. Heinrich Himmler and his SS soon move to gain the loyalty of the army and seek a seperate peace with the Soviets.  Once that's accomplished, Himmler appoints Erwin Rommel, 'the Desert Fox,' to command an alternate version of the 'Battle of the Bulge.'  While at times Dobson and Niles spend a little too much time showing off the fruits of their research, which is impressive, they do manage to tell a riveting story, and while some aspects of 'Fox' do stretch the reader's believabilty, the story is riveting and builds to an explosive climax.  But perhaps the most fun is the simple question that the authors ask and attempt to answer:  What would have happened had Erwin Rommel commanded the Ardennes Offensive?  A great ride that ranks among the best works of alternate history.	2001-03-04

In the future, fireman don't put out fires, they start them.  It is their job to seek out books and put them to the flame, making sure that no one indulges in the 'crime' of reading one.  But what makes this nightmare so interesting, and relevant, is that it was not forced upon the people by their government, but was decided upon by the people themselves.  Minority groups, religions, and ethnicities, who were offended by the words of writers, simply made reading unpopular and convinced the world that books were, first, a waste of time, and then the root of all evil.  A wonderful 'Negative Utopia' novel in the tradition of '1984' and 'Brave New World' Bradbury's novel differs in his writing style.  His prose is difficult to follow and at times leaves the reader unimpressed.  If you can you're not easily turned off by Bradbury's odd and difficult way of writing perhaps you'll enjoy the deeper message of this work.	2001-03-04

Hohne's book, 'Canaris: Hitler's Master Spy,' is a penetrating look at Hitler's head of military intelligence during World War Two.  Hohne traces the rise of Canaris from his days as a lieutenant in World War One to his tenure as head of the Ahwehr and finally to his ultimate downfall at the hands of the Gestapo.  The narrative does sometimes go off on tangents (notably the chapters on Canaris's role in the murders of communist leaders in the 1920's,)  but also provides amazing insights into German foreign intelligence and the military conspiracy against Hitler that culminated in the July 20th 1944 bomb attempt.  For anyone interested in World War Two espionage, the inner-workings of Nazi Germany, or deeper matters of conscience, Hohne's book will more than delight.	2001-02-12

When history teacher and sometime CIA anylist Jack Ryan intervenes in an IRA hit on the Prince of Wales, he soon finds himself a political target. When his family is attacked in Baltimore Ryan again goes to work for the CIA in the hopes of stopping the terrorists. While the story is gripping and the action scenes fast-paced and exciting, the first two hundred pages of the book are for the most part slow. If you're a patient reader you should get through it okay. The ending is a climax in the great Clancy tradition and the characters, as always, are people you'd like to know. There is much more in the book than in the movie, but it's essentially the same story. On the whole it's a great first ride for Jack Ryan.	2001-01-26

The second novel of Harry Turtledove's 'Colonization' series, 'Down to Earth,' is better than 'Second Contact,' but only just.  The four major powers, America, the Soviet Union, the German Reich, and the alien Lizards still eye each other with distrust across a planet and in outer space.  Like most Turtledove novels the interesting plot is often times negated by the scope of the overall story.  It's far too long and there are just too many characters to keep straight to make this one of the author's better novels, (think 'Guns of the South.')  Also, too often the alternate history story is sacrificed for the sake of it's science fiction aspects.  There are a few moments where Turtledove gives us some food for thought: Power struggles in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia, America with something to hide, and a stunning climax that hopefully will lead to some interesting situations in the next volume.  Here's hoping that Turtledove will start writing more straight alternate history novels with fewer characters, (once again, think 'Guns of the South.')	2001-01-26

Cleon Skousen's book 'The Naked Communist' is one of the finest works ever written on the subject of the communist conspiracy and should be read by everyone who loves the United States of America.  Skousen does a wonderful job exposing the lies that communists have used since Karl Marx first wrote the communist manifesto.  The book was written in the early sixties and it's amazing to see just how many predictions Skousen made that have come true.  Skousen also points out the many flaws that has left the United Nations virtually powerless to stop aggressor nations.  But perhaps the most interesting facts that Skousen sheds light on are the circumstances surrounding Roosevelt's concessions to Stalin and Truman's concessions to Mao.  These 'Appeasers' made the same mistakes that Chamberlin made in his dealing's with Hitler in the 1930's.  Many are quick to dismiss the spectre of Communism since the end of the cold war but America must remain ever vigilant and always beware the influences of the EXTREME left.	2001-01-02

Glenn Meade's novel 'The Sands of Sakkara' is a well thought out page turner that fans of World War Two spy fiction will love.  The story revolves around two friends, Harry Weaver and Jack Halder, who find themselves on opposite sides of a plot to kill the President of the United States.  Set during the Cairo conference of 1943, Halder is sent to scope out the security surrounding Roosevelt so that Otto Skorzeny's crack SS commandos can move in.  But British intelligence soon learns of the plan and tries to stop him with the help of American Lt. Col. Harry Weaver.  In the center of the action, and these two men's lives, is Rachel Stern, the woman they both love.

But Uneven	'The Vampire Armand,' is Anne Rice's account of the four hundred year old bloodsucker who made his first appearence in 'Interview with the Vampire.'  'Armand' begins with the protagonist relaying his story to the newly undead David Talbot.  The story Armand tells is that of his abduction from his boyhood home of Kiev, to being sold into slavery in Constantinople, to his eventual education and seduction by the Vampire Marius in Renaissance Venice.  The story ends with Armand's account of his part in the events detailed in Rice's earlier work, 'Memnoch the Devil.'  While Armand and Marius are undoubtedly two of Rice's greatest creations, the story told here is rather slow and inconsistant.  Just when Rice gives you some real food for thought and truly chilling moments she backs away quickly and indulges in beautifully written, though ultimatly unsatisfying, sensual prose.  Missing is the rye wit of Rice's greatest protagonist, the Vampire Lestat.  That having been said Rice does deliver some wonderful moments that capture the spirit of the 'Vampire Chronicles' brilliantly.  Armand's faith is also an amazing spin on the typically jaded Vampire attitude toward life and love.  Fans of the series should check it out but those new to the world of Rice's Vampires would do better to start with 'Interview with the Vampire,' or 'The Vampire Lestat.'	2000-12-16

Kim Philby, Donald Maclean, and Guy Burgess were all firmly part of the British establishment- Maclean and Burgess in the Foreign Office and Philby in the Secret Intelligence Service.  All three worked for the ideals upon which the British nation and world democracy were founded- at least that's what they were able to convince not only the world, but their friends and family as well.  In fact all three were highly placed Soviet agents who sold out their nation in the name of ideology.  'The Philby Conspiracy' by Bruce Page, David Leitch, and Phillip Knightley is a brilliant look into their careers as respectable pillars of British society and as cunning communist agents.  Wonderfully researched, this book looks at Philby's, Maclean's, Burgess's flirtation with communism during their university years and the lengths to which they went to avoid detection.  Philby himself served with Franco's fascists during Spain's civil war in an attempt to downplay his own left-wing past.  For anyone interested in cold war espionage, or for a better understanding of just what can drive a man to treason, 'The Philby Conspiracy' is must reading.	2000-12-16

In 'The Goebbles Diaries, 1942-43,' we are given a glimpse into the mind of Nazi Germany's genius of propaganda and one of Hitler's most trusted lieutenants.  These diaries shed light on the Nazis view of Churchill, Stalin and all the other central figures of the era.  Goebbels also tells us of the anger he and other leading Nazis felt over the defection of Italy to the allied camp, dealing with the devastating allied air raids, and the fear and anxiety over the revearses on the Eastern front.  Unfortunatley, these pages don't give us as clear a view of Hitler as one would hope and passages dealing with the Holocaust are few and far between.  In all, Goebbels presents himself as a champion of National Socialist ideals who is loved by Germany and respected by his enemies.  What one really sees is the almost ridiculous opptimism that Goebbels held through these years of struggle.  It is surprising just how firm was Goebbel's conviction that victory was certain.  Those interested in the Third Reich should read Goebbel's diaries as it is a rare look into this troubled time written by one of it's greatest criminals.	2000-12-02

Set in a world where Germany won World War Two, 'Fatherland,' is an amazing murder mystery that will keep you guessing right up to the end.  SS Sturmbannfuhrer Xavier March is assigned to the case when a body appears along the banks of the Havel.  When March learns the identity of the body, a high-ranking Nazi in Poland during the war, the Gestpo order him off the case.  Unwilling to stop looking for answers, March takes on the head of the Gestapo, General Globus, in an attempt to unravel a mystery that dates all the way back to World War Two.  What makes this novel truly riveting is the subtle way Harris incorperates the reality we all know into the nightmare world of a victorious Nazi Germany.  It's easy to see traces of Martin Cruz Smith's 'Gorky Park' in this work, the two novels are very similar, but 'Fatherland' is much more exciting.  Both as a smart mystery story and a condemnation of totalitarianism this novel delivers!  This is easily the best alternate history novel I have ever read!	2000-11-22

Katharine Burdekin's 1937 novel, 'Swastika Night,' is a rare work of science fiction that explores not only the evils of military totalitarianism, but also closely examines the realationship between the sexes.  Over 700 years into the Hitlerian era Europe has become a fuedel society where Hitler is God, Christians are persecuted, and women are reduced to the status of animal breeders.  A Nazi leader, the Knight von Hess, gives a disillusioned Englishman the greatest of gifts- a book written centuries before that tells the true story of world history and not the Hitler version that Germany accepts as gospel.  It's easy to see the many similarities between 'Swastika Night' and George Orwell's '1984.'  Both novels take place in a repressive, totalitarian society where a government leader deigns to help a member of the lower class.  Also, the themes of massive nation-states in constant competition and degradaded womanhood make one wonder just how much Orwell 'borrowed' from Burdekin.  What makes this novel truly amazing, however, is Burdekin's prediction of the horrors to come.  She wrote of the comming war with Germany, predicting both the extermination of the Jews and the prolonged, devastating war in Russia.  A wonderful work on many levels, 'Swastika Night' is more than just an entertaining novel, it's an important one.	2000-11-16

Richard Sharpe, a Sergeant in the King's Army for four years, is sent on a dangerous mission to capture a former East India Company Lieutenant who is now a Major in the forces of an Indian prince.  Sharpe, resolute as always, determines to find the traitor and bring him to justice in the hopes that this success will reward him with an officer's commission.  But hot on his tail is Sharpe's old enemy Obidiah Hakeswill, a man so vile that he will stop at nothing to get his revenge.  While it was fun to see characters like Hakeswill and Colonel McCandless again, the story boggs down at times.  Missing is the humor that Sharpe's future Sergeant Harper brought to the series and the tense drama of fighting the armies of Napoleon.  The view Cornwell gives us of the battle of Assaye, however, is stunning.  Only Cornwell could make batttlefield action come alive in such a brilliant and unmistakable way.  Fans of the series should check this one out but if you're new to the world of Richard Sharpe may I recommend starting with either 'Sharpe's Tiger,' or 'Sharpe's Rifles.'	2000-11-11

April, 1945: Winston Churchill, fearing the coming cold war with Soviet Russia, gives an order that will change history- the assassination of Josef Stalin.  The events that follow from this fantastic decision alter the course of the war slightly, but very definatly.  Bova's use of historical characters is first rate.  From General George S. Patton seeking a way to beat the Russians to Berlin, to an insane Adolf Hitler hidden in his bunker, to Franklin Roosevelt overseeing the final victory, to a young Yuri Gagarin with dreams of traveling to the stars, this a fun and interesting look at what might have been.	2000-11-02

Blandford traces the rise of the Abwehr and SD from their earliest appearence on the German stage to the Reich's final collapse.  In addition to providing detailed portraits of Whilhelm Canaris and Reinhard Heydrich, Blanford also gives us wonderful looks at such Nazi adventurers as Heydrich's 'James Bond'- Alred Naujocks, and the cunning Walter Schellenberg.  Particularly interesting are the early escapades these men.  From Naujocks' mission to assassinate a 'Black Front' broadcaster in Czechoslovakia and his masterminding of the Gleiwitz radio 'incident,' to Schellenberg's kidnapping of two British agents on the Dutch border in 1939, Blandford's book is compelling from start to finish.

Victor von Frankenstein, a young and ambitious scientist, discovers the secret of bestowing life on lifeless matter.  After creating a hideously deformed being Frankenstein quits the experiment and leaves his 'monster' to his own devices.  Months later Frankenstein pays the price as the 'monster' seeks it's revenge.  Far from the Boris Karloff idea of Frankenstein's monster, Shelly's creature is one that invokes sympathy and pity as he is cast out from the human world and forced to endure existence without companionship.  The basic theme of the work is also an important moral- that obsession, if unchecked, can only result in despair.  Truly a great work and one that fans of horror have embraced for over one hundred years.	2000-10-26

Robbins novel, 'The War of the Rats,' is a horror-filled look at the demise of the German Sixth Army at Stalingrad, and the legendary sniper duel that took place amid so much destruction.  The narrative presents the Russian super-sniper, Zatsiev, as the protagonist and the German, Thorvald, as the less-than-dynamic villian who challenge each other through the crosshairs as two mighty armies clash along the Volga river.  The Russian Zatsiev is made a hero in communist newspapers throughout the Soviet Union when he proves the greatest sniper in the Red army.  To bring down Soviet moral the German command decides to send Thorvald, the leader of Germany's elite sniper school at Gnossen, to beat Zatsiev at his own game.  What happens next is an exciting battle of skill between the two warriors.  While at times the story slows down, Robbins' treatment of the hardships of the largest battle of World War Two are brought amazingly to life.  The reader can't help but pity the common soldiers of both armies as they are needlessly sacrificed by their respective governments.  A first rate thriller, 'The War of the Rats,' is must reading for fans of great military fiction, (the story is a novelization of actual events.)  Wonderful!	2000-10-21

David Fraser's biography of Erwin Rommel, 'Knight's Cross,' is subtitled, 'A Life of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel.'  It should be subtitled, 'A Career of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel.'  While the great General's skillful campaigns in France, North Africa, and France again are nothing short of brilliant, quite a bit is left out of the overall picture of the man.  Rommel's years before World War I and during the Weimar era are barely examined.  Instead, author Fraser focuses on the general history of the time, leaving the portrait of Rommel somewhat incomplete.  That said, Fraser also gives us a first rate look at the battlefield genius and basic goodness of the man that was Erwin Rommel.  Fraser spends much of the work successfully dispelling the myth of Rommel's lack of strategic consideration by showing his constant worry over the battles in Russia and his own precarious situations in Tunisia and Normandy.  Also brought to light are the circumstances surrounding Rommel's part in the July 20th bomb plot and his forced suicide.  For anyone interested in World War Two or the methods of great leadership in general, Fraser's biography is sure to entertain and enlighten.	2000-10-14

Joseph Heywood's novel 'The Berkut,' is a fast-paced thriller set in the aftermath of World War Two.  SS Colonel Guther Brumm arrives in besieged Berlin by glider to do the impossible- fake the death of Adolf Hitler and take the Fuhrer from the war torn capital of the Reich to safety.  And that's the easy part.  Brumm, along with Hitler and a small group of followers, makes his way south through Germany.  But close on Brumm's tail is Vasily Petrov, leader of a team of Soviet investigators who will stop at nothing to find Hitler- or face Stalin's wrath.  The story that follows is one of action and terror as Brumm plays a deadly game of cat and mouse with Petrov through the bombed-out wastelands of Europe.  Author Heywood's research is first rate as he re-creates the end of the Second World War.  Though the basic premise is a little far-fetched, Heywood successfully pulls it off with flying colors.  The characters are many but mostly well-drawn and the story's anti-hero, Brumm, is a creation that brings to mind another cold blooded adventurer, Frederick Forsyth's 'Jackal.'

From the disappearance of two bodies buried in the Alaskan wilderness to car chases in the middle of San Diego to the most exciting modern naval battle this side of Tom Clancy's 'Red Storm Rising,' this is a great adventure yarn- and all this leads to an explosive climax that will leave you wanting more.

For anyone who doubts that this statement is true then you haven't read 'Time Enough For Love.'  'Time' is the story of Lazarus Long, a human being who was born in the early twentieth century but simply doesn't die.  By the 42nd century, however, Lazarus has had enough.  Having been 'rescued' from an attempted suicide Lazarus tells his story to one of his many decendants and finally embarks upon a quest of staggering dimensions all to keep from simply being bored.  Throughout this novel the voice of the author is heard.  From his sage wisdom to matters of simple common sense, Heinlein speaks through his creation with honesty, sentiment, and of course his trademark wit.  The many other characters that populate this work are no less interesting.  From a spaceship that longs to be human to Lazarus' own geneticly cloned sisters, these are characters in the rich Heinlein tradition.  Heinlein also provides us with pages all dedicated to favorite sayings of his protagonist.  These 'Notebooks of Lazarus Long,' of which another, beautifully illustrated book was created, make this novel worth reading alone.  'Time Enough For Love,' is one of those rare works of fiction that makes you laugh, cry, and most important of all, think. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys good Science Fiction or lovers of imagination in general.	2000-10-01

In 'The Tale of the Body Thief' Anne Rice continues her tale of the undead that she began in 1976's 'Interview with the Vampire.'  In 'Body Thief,' the anti-hero Lestat is made an offer he can't refuse: To become human again by switching bodies with a master of astral projection.  Offering Lestat sage advice is the human leader of the Talamasca, David Talbot, whom Lestat has begged unsuccessfully to join him as an undead companion.  Once the transformation takes place Lestat again experiences life as a human.  He eats, sleeps, and makes love with a passion unknown to him for two centuries.  After Rice's novel, 'The Vampire Lestat,' this is by far the most entertaining and philisophical.  From Lestat revealing his true self to a sympathetic nun to Talbot explaining his meeting with God and the Devil in a Paris cafe, this is by far her most thought-provoking work, and a lot of fun!	2000-09-29

Clancy's new novel, 'The Bear and the Dragon' is proof once more of the author's amazing story-telling abilities.  This time out President Jack Ryan, (newly-elected,) has his hands full with Russia, China, and his own staff.  In Russia Ryan's friend and head of the Russian Security Service, Golovko, is targeted by unknown assassins.  The good news for the Ivans is that huge gold and oil deposits are located in their backyard- Siberia.  This unexpected wealth draws the interest, (and jealousy,) of their neighbors the Chinese.  When ecomonic factors in the US and around the world threaten China's prosperity the Politburo makes a horrifying desicion: War with Russia and her new ally, the USA.  Though this book ranks with the many other great Clancy novels it is, perhaps, a little too long.  At well over a thousand pages the story does seem a little stretched sometimes.  Also, Ryan seems to do more whinning in this book than ever before- Something you'd never expect from the hero of 'Red October' and 'Sum of All Fears.'  These points aside 'The Bear and the Dragon' is a thrilling ride with a trademark Clancy climax that will leave you breathless!	2000-09-22

Though 'Beat to Quarters' falls in the middle of the Hornblower series it was the first written, as well as one of the best.  The story takes place when Hornblower is ordered to assist colonial Spanish rebels.  After defeating a Spanish warship and handing the vessel over to the rebels Hornblower recieves shocking news: Napoleon has invaded Spain.  Now that Spain has become Britian's ally Hornblower must reagain control of the Spanish warship from the rebels and give it back to the rightful owners.  The action that follows is the naval adventure that author C. S. Forester is known for.  Also, Forester throws his gallant protagonist a curve ball by introducing him to Lady Pamela Wellesely, sister of the Duke of Wellington.  The attraction is sudden and unexpected but more than a little complicated.  One of the best novels in the series, 'Beat to Quarters' is consistantly exciting and absolutly entertaining.  Fans of the series and those new to it will applaud Forester's first Hornblower novel.	2000-09-21

And, like 'Mr. Midshipman,' it is one of the lower points in the series.  'Admiral Hornblower,' is the only Hornblower novel to take place during peacetime and so the action, where it is, seems a little forced.  Lacking is the adventure of Hornblower braving the odds to meet an impossible objective.  Instead, many of the stories focus on much more trivial aspects of Her Majesty's Navy.  Of course this is still a Hornblower book by the master, C. S. Forester, and he doesn't leave the reader competely high and dry.  The first story, by far the best, deals with Hornblower's attempt to intercept a French vessel bound for St. Helena.  Hornblower must use all his cunning to stop the would-be liberators of Napoleon Bonoparte from his island prison.  Also there are a some moving moments as Hornblower takes the time to relect on his brilliant career and years of service.  A must read for fans of the series but certainly not Forester's best.	2000-09-21

Like the memiors of Hitler's armaments  minister, Albert Speer, Schellenberg's account gives us a penetrating look  into the inner workings of the Nazi regime.  Unlike Speer's account  however, Schellenberg sticks to his own field, intelligence, and completly  ignores the larger, darker questions of the men he served so faithfully.  That aside, 'The Labyrinth' is a remarkable glimpse into the world of  German intelligence during World War Two.  Schellenberg gives us the same  kind of intimate portrait of Heinrich Himmler that Albert Speer gave of  Adolf Hitler in 'Inside the Third Reich.'  Schellenberg also gives us a  memorable look at men like Reinhard Heydrich, Whilhelm Canaris, Heinrich  Mueller, and Ernst Kaltenbrunner.  But the heart of this work is  Schellenberg's own experiences as head of foreign intelligence and counter  intelligence.  Included are Schellenberg's scheme to kidnap the Duke of  Windsor in Portugal in 1940, his 'turning' of Russian POW's to the Nazi  cause, and his capture of two British secret service officers on the  Dutch-German border in 1939.  The narrative ends with Schellenberg's  attempts to secure the surrender of the western armies to the allies on  behalf of Himmler.  For anyone interested in the Nazi intelligence system  of the Second World War or of true spy stories in general this is a work  that will not disappoint.  If you enjoyed this work you might want to check  out Gerald Reitlinger's 'SS: Alibi of a nation, 1922-45,' for a larger  picture of the German SS.	2000-09-20

If you were a fan of the BBC's 'A Bit of Fry and Laurie,' with it's madcap  Monty Python-esque humor, then Laurie's first novel will keep you howling  with laughter.  Laurie's dry British wit is to be found in abundance in  this slightly off center thriller.  Thomas Lang, a cynical ex-soldier, is  approached by a man who wants to know if he would consider comitting a  murder- the man's own.  What follows is Lang's frantic, (and hilarious,)  search to find out just who can be trusted.  From dim-witted hit men to  crabby police officers, to world arms dealers, 'Gun Seller' runs the gambit  from heart stopping tension to laugh-out-loud humor.  As the story  progresses the humor does tend to take a backseat which is unfortunate.  The plot is good but the book's strength relies on Laurie's irony,  sarcasim, and ability to use the English language in print as well as he  does in performance.  More than worth a look if you're a fan of Laurie or  if you enjoy well written comedy.	2000-09-18

Frank Herbert's novel 'Dune,' ranks among the great works of fiction and  is perhaps the greatest of it's genre.  The novel is a subtle but effective  weaving together of political intrigue, heart-racing action, intense story,  and incredably well-drawn characters.  Paul Atredies, the young son of the  Duke Leto, and his family are removed from their home world of Calidan to  oversee operations on the desert world of Arrakis, or as it is better  known, Dune.  The story that follows sees Paul grow not only into a man,  but into a super-human being capable of destroying the hated enemies of the  Atredies, the evil Harkonnen.  Herbert's understanding of human nature  serves him well in this novel and his concerns about our own ecology are  apparent.  Like Asimov's 'Foundation,' series and the 'Childe Cycle' of  Gorden R. Dickson, Herbert's 'Dune' is a classic of Science Fiction that  will ignite any reader's imagination.	2000-09-17

Clarke's short story 'The Sentinal,' filmaker  Stanely Kubrick enlisted the author's aide in creating what he deemed the  'perverbial good science-fiction movie.'  The result of this great  collaberation was '2001: A Space Odyssey.'  The novel, which came out after  the movie but was created at the same time, is a stirring tale of human  evolution, exploration, and hope.  The story begins with our ape-like  progenitors and their discovery of a odd object- a black monolith, that  boosts their IQ to a level that will promote thier evolution.  Fast forward  three million years: NASA discovers a strange object- a black monolith,  buried beneath the lunar surface.  When the sun hits it for the first time  in three million years it sends a signal across the solar system.  The  expedition that follows is filled with hope, but will it succeed?  The  novel does have several minor differences from the 1968 film- for instance  the planet of destination is Saturn, not Jupiter.  But if you have seen the  film and are a little confused as to what the monolith is and just what  transformation the astronaut Bowman underwent, the book will answer you  questions.

In the  novel the Nazis control the US from the east coast to about the Rocky  Mountians while Japan holds California, Oregon, and Washington.  What's  left in the middle is what's left of the United States.  The plot centers  around a Nazi high official's visit to his Japanese opposite number in San  Fransico.  The nature of this visit could determine the fate of North  America, and the rest of the World.  Along the way Dick gives us plenty of  food for thought:  A Japanese obsession with the old west, A power struggle  between Josef Goebbels and Reinhard Heydrich, A civilisation that embraces  the 'I, Ching,' instead of the Bible, and the lengths that a Jew must go to  simply to stay alive in a world where to be different is the greatest  crime.  The book was written in the early sixties and contains a few too  many science-fictiony ideas: the Mediteranean Sea drained and used as  farmland, moonbases and advanced spaceflight.  Although you must blink your  eyes at these few distractions, the book is a lot of fun and makes wonder  just what life would have been like in an American Reich.	2000-09-17
US	50302730	RLYCQ16QTXXFV	055356241X	807397831	Mars	Books	3	14	19	N	N	Life on Mars?	Ben Bova's novel 'Mars' is slow, a little too slow at times, but  nevertheless is a fun journey to the red planet.  The story deals with an  international expedition to Mars whose primary mission is to search for  signs of life.  Along the way rivalries and romance spring up among the  crew.  While the science-fiction is hard and entertaining, the story more  often delves into the realm of soap opera.  Bova is an author that no doubt  has done extensive research on the subject of space travel but this proves  to be both a plus and a minus.  Sometimes it feels as though he's forcing  situations into the book to show off his research, more often than not to  the detrement of the plot.  Of course, the plot itself is rather thin.  But  I do have to say that Bova throws in more than a few twists and turns that  will hold your interest and gives us a clever ending.  If you're looking  for something that's fairly easy to read and you enjoy B-movie characters,  this one could be for you.	2000-09-17

In his novel 'The Fist of God,' Forsyth tells the story of the gulf war  with the (fictional?) threat of Iraqi nuclear capability.  The story is  multi-leveled and centers around British and American attempts to sabotage  the production of an Iraqi atomic bomb.  The characters range from a  British commando behind the lines in Kuwait, to a Mossad agent romancing a  European banker, to the butcher of bagdad himself, Saddam Hussein.  Along  the way, the reader is treated to Forsyth's unique style that keeps the  pace moving from page one.  Like the novels of Tom Clancy, this one makes  you wonder just how much the author knows about the inner-workings of  Washington, London, and other centers of power throughout the world.  How  much of this novel is true?  I don't know.  But I do know that for anyone  who loves great action and well thought out thrillers this is a novel that  is sure to please.	2000-09-12

Vidal's  unusual writing style serves him well as the narrative shifts back and  forth from the correspondence of two powerful senators and Julian's own  memoirs.  The story (how historically accurate I cannot say,) tells the  story of the young prince Julian living at the mercy of his dreaded cousin  the Emperor.  When events come into play he is thrust into the supreme seat  of power himself and must combat not only the barabrians to the east, but  the empire's own viral infection: Christianity.  Julian's attempts to  return the empire to the paganism that served it so well in years past is  at the very heart of this story.  One can certainly feel the court paranoia  that prevailed in these troubled times that rivaled the excesses of Nazi  Germany and Stalinist Russia.  This is a great book and one that I would  highly recommend to anyone interested in this era or in the workings of  political power in general.	2000-09-12

Alibi of a  nation, 1922-45' was published and yet it still remains one of the most  informative and important books on the subject of Nazi Germany and the SS.  In 1945-6 the Nuremburg court ruled that the SS was a criminal organization  and membership itself was a crime.  Reitlinger argues that this was a  mistake- in criminalizing this one organization, the court all but absolved  the other bureacratic agencies that contributed no less assiduously to the  'Final Solution,' and provided a nation that willingly followed Hitler with  the ultimate scapegoat.  Throughout the book the reader is introduced to  lesser known, though no less responsible, members of Hitler's Reich- Martin  Luther, Walter Schellenberg, and Gottlieb Berger are just some of the  every-day bureacrats that allowed such terror to reign supreme in Germany  for twelve years.  Truly a great work of history.	2000-09-07

I was a little skepitcal when I read the first book in this series, 'American Front.'  I felt it conatined far too many characters and  situations that the overall story would get lost in the shuffle.  This fear  followed me into the next book, 'Walk in Hell.'  Although 'Walk' was a lot  better I was worried that Turtledove was missing out on some great ideas  with regaurds to the way the European war progressed and also the political  aspects of the war in the two Americas.  But I am happy to say that the new  book in the series, 'Breakthroughs,' addresses these aspects of the war in  a wonderful and satisfying way.  As the war continues, new tactics are  employed that allow the U.S. to force her enemies to seek peace- but that's  just the beginning of the troubles that lie ahead, troubles that both  Yankees and Rebs simply aren't prepared for.  In the north the U.S. must  learn to integrate it's hard-won conquests into the union, in the south  confederates stuggle to adjust to humiliation and defeat and turtledove  even gives a character with disturbing parrellels to Adolf Hitler during  his time in the trenches.  Far and away the best of the series so far  (excluding 'How Few Remain') this is a fun romp through what might have  been.  Turtldove is once again on top of his game!	2000-09-02

Though the novel is fictional and the  characters cleary the author's creations, it nevertheless shows the extent  of the author's exhaustive research into today's Russia.  The story centers  around a major Russian political power who loses a secret protcol (an  updated 'Mein Kampf')  and his frantic search to get it back before his  policies of destruction become known.  Aware of this secret protocol is an  ex-CIA agent, Jason Monk, who will stop at nothing to expose this  would-be-Hitler as the monster he is.  Along the way he tangles with the  Russian Politician's securtiy chief-  a former KGB officer who bested Monk  during the cold war.  This is another exciting novel from a master of  suspence.  It not only effectivly weaves cold war intrigue and modern day  fears about a rearmed Russia, but Forsyth's inclusion of the true story of  Aldrich Aimes, the notorious CIA traitor, make this a particularly wild  ride.  While 'Icon' isn't of quite the same caliber of Forsyth's earlier  work, it is a riviting novel that will keep you on the edge of your seat.	2000-08-31

Churchill's life is traced with all the power, wit, and  determination that marked Britain's famed war and peacetime Prime Minister.  Gilbert's account succeeds on many levels, but perhaps the most  illuminating are the portraits he gives us of Churchill during the First  World War and in his second Priemership.  Churchill's frustration with the  government over their unwillingness to clear his name after the Dardenelles  fiasco makes for riviting reading and the old man's stubborn refusal to  resign from the Prime Ministership in the early fifies gives a unique  glimpse into the heart of this great man.  Gilbert also gives us a  wonderful look at Chruchill the writer as his process of creating his  wonderful histories and biographies is examined.  Throughtout this work,  Gilbert presents Churchill objectivly, but still with a real, personal  warmness.  Reading the accounts of Chruchill's death at the end of the book  make one feel as though they have lost a friend.  Winston Churchill was  undoubtedly one of the century's most critical figures- he was the man who  beat Hitler- but for a personal, deeply moving account Gilbert's work is  one that is not to be missed.	2000-08-24

Reading the diary Miller is enraged at the abuses of  the sadistic camp commandant and vows to find him and bring him to justice.

As Miller gets closer and closer to the truth, his life is put in  jeoperady.  Finally, with the aide of Jewish Nazi-hunters, he begins a plan  that will end either with the Riga commandant at the end of a rope, or his  own grisly death.  Thrilling from the first page, 'The Odessa File'  contains the same heart-pounding suspense that filled Forsyth's earlier  work, 'The Day of the Jackel,' and has one of the greatest twist endings in  modern fiction.

I consider myself a fan of both the books of Harry Turtledove and the  films of Richard Dreyfuss so I was very excited to read their novel, 'The  Two Georges.'  Unfortunatly, this is not one of Turtledove's better  Alternate History stories.  The premise presupposes a colonial  reconciliation with the Britsh during the American Revolution that allows  all of North America to be a British possesion well into the twentith  century.  The story surrounds the investigation of a stolen painting.  The  thieves, memebers of the terrorist organization 'Sons of Liberty,' want to  spoil the festivites planned for a visit by the King to his North American  subjects.  While the book does have some interesting ideas- the 'Sons'  consider George Washington a traitor for ending the war, technology has  progressed at a considerably slowed pace, Abraham Lincoln was the first  American Prime Minister of the empire- the story is far too slow and long.  There is no clear villain and the plot tends to really bog down at times.  Also, there are a few too many leaps of logic that simply wouldn't make  sense.  If the point of divergence were the American Revolution would a  Richard Nixon have been around to sell used cars?  Would a Martin Luther  King ever have existed to become the North American governor?  All in all  this is not one of Turtledove's better works which is really a shame with  all the potential it has.  Nevertheless, if your looking for great  alternate history check out Turtledove's 'Guns of the South,' or 'How Few  Remain,' or Ward Moore's 'Bring the Jubilee,' all set in the American Civil  War.	2000-08-21

Churchill tells the story  of the war from the massive rearmament of Germany in the thirties to the  final victory over the forces of fascism.  As a general history of the war  it is understandably one-sided, but as a wartime memoir it succeeds on many  levels.  The feelings of the British Prime Minister on the strategies,  soldiers, enemies, and allies of the war are brought to the foreground with  an amazing command of language.  Churchill justifies many of the more  controversial decsions of the war including his stand on British rearmament  before the war, the terror bombing of German cities, the 'unconditional  surrender' policy of the allies, and the use of the Atomic bomb.  This is a  finely crafted work that is a tribute to a man who could make history as  well as write it.	2000-08-20

A combination of literary  skill, gripping story, and truly real characters put this novel on par with  his most famous work, 'All Quiet on the Western Front.'  'Spark' deals with  the final months of World War Two in a German concentration camp.  509, one  of the longest held prisoners in the camp, is convinced that despite what  the SS tell them the war will soon be over and the camp liberated.  509's  fellow inmates, old and young, Jews and politicals, all draw strength from  509 and his will to not just survive, but to somehow stay human in a world  where savagery is king.  While the prisoners themselves hold to this hope  tightly, the SS have their own worries.  The camp commamdant's holdings  throughout the small town are going up in flames as the British and  Americans continually bomb the area and the guards are left with a choice:  Run from the camp and risk treason against the Fuhrer, or exterminate all  the surviving prisoners in one final orgy of blood.  Once again Remarque  has created a world so real, so certain, it both moves and educates the  reader.

Frederick Forsyth's novel, 'The Day of the jackel,' is one of the all time great suspense thrillers, if not the best.

Turtledove's 'Worldwar'  series, which begins here, is one of his greatest creations.  Dealing with  warfare on a grand scale, and the great science-fiction tradition of alien  invasion, the 'Worldwar' series is a fun and entertaining marraige of  thought-provoking alternate history and classic science-fiction.  There are  a few too many characters and the plot does tend to slow down at times but  these are minor points when compared with the overall strength of the  story.

'The Great War: Walk in Hell,' is the continuation of Turledove's story of  a divided America which began with 'How Few Remain.'  'Walk' picks up in  1915 while war and revolution explode across both the United States and the  Confederate States of America.  In the South, the oppressed black minority  fights to hold on to the Socialist republic that they have created while in  Salt Lake City Mormon extremeists once again challenge the Federal  government.  At the same time thousands of men die each day in the trenches  that separate the two powers.  While 'Walk' isn't nearly as entertaining as  Turtledove's 'Guns of the South' or 'How Few Remain,' it is considerably  better than the novel which precedes this one, 'The Great War: American  Front.'  In 'Walk' the characters that Turtledove created in 'American  Front' are fleshed out and don't seem to be merely there as a means of  advancing the plot.  Also, the political struggle is exmained a little  closer when the U.S. tries to annex captured Confederate territory.

Sadly, the first novel in the follow-up  to that series doesn't quite measure up.  Taking place twenty years after  the events in 'WorldWar,' 'Colonization' tells the story of a world shaped  by the Lizard invasion during the Second World War.  The peace made after  the war left four super-powers that continued to butt heads into the  1960's- The United States, Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, and the  territories held by the alien Lizards.  The story is far too long and at  times it really bogs down.  Also, like many of Turtledove's novels there  are too many characters to really find anyone to root for.  Most of them  are far too one-sided and don't seem to contribute anyting to plot.  However, this novel does do it's author justice in many of the ideas  expressed and his handling of many historical characters.  Himmler is the  Fuhrer of the German Reich who still ruthlessly continues the programs of  racial purity, Molotov, now the leader of the Soviet Union, must battle  with hostile forces within his own government, and in the United States a  project with galactic reprecussions is in progress, all this under the  unfriedly eyes of the Lizard aggressors.  Not one of Turtledove's great  novels, 'Colonization: Second Contact,' is a lot of fun for history buffs  and has enough wonder for mainstream science-fiction fans.	2000-08-13

In addition to the history and evolution of the  Gehime Staats Polizi, this book also covers the methods of terror the  Gestapo used in carrying out it's policies of destruction and murder.  Also  included is a breakdown of the various departments and divisions within the  organization.  But perhaps most illuminating is the inclusion of several  stories by those who came face to face with the dreaded secret police- from  a leader in the Polish underground to an unexpected, and almost comical,  meeting with Reinhard Heydrich, these stories fill in the gaps of human  emotion that most historians often fail to convey.  If you are interested  in just how the Nazi's were able to silence their political opponents with  the terror that came to be their trademark, Butler's book is must reading.	2000-08-11

And finally,  Hornblower must make a choice about whether to accept the office of post  Captain in a foreign navy or 'in spite of all temptations to belong to  other nations, to remain an Englishman.'  The novel really doesn't pick up  until after Hornblower leaves England but it soon gains momentum and  doesn't stop.  C.S. Forester is truly one of the greatest writers of the  20th century and 'Hornblower and the Atropos' will attest to that.	2000-08-10

In 1863, the Union loss at Gettysburg paved the way for southern  independence and left the United States a backward, third world country.  The novel's protaganist, Hodge, leaves his rural home for what he hopes  will be a better life in New York City and eventually finds himself in a  community of scholars where his final destiny awaits him.  The characters,  situations and philosiphies of 'Jubilee' remind the reader of another great  Science Fiction author, Robert Heinlein.  Moore has the same wonderful  ability to convey the complex ideas of life and society that make  Heinlein's novels so compelling.  Also wonderful is Moore's explanations of  temporal theory and his understanding and presentation of the Battle of  Gettysburg.  If you enjoy alternate history then 'Bring the Jubilee' will  not disappoint.	2000-08-01

The story spans one thousand years and deals with the monks' attempts to preserve human knowledge against the  barbarous dark age that had decended upon the Earth.  This is one of those  rare novels that combines biting satire with a wonderful story and rich  characters.  There are a few times when the story tends to get bogged down,  but these lulls are more than made up for by genuine thrilling moments and  a very satisfying ending.  Religion, philosiphy, and humor illustrate this  wonderful novel of mankind searching for collective redemption and  wondering at just what cost salvation will come.	2000-07-28

'Sunset' tells the story of Lazarus Long's mother, Maureen Johnson.  While the bookends of this story are very definatly science-fiction, most of the  novel, with a few exeptions, reads very much like a straight autobiography-  and is all the richer for it.  Only a talent like Heinlein could create  such a character, strong-willed and free-spirited, and tell her story with  wit, charm, and no small human emotion.  Also amazing is the way in which  Heinlein ties in events from another of his great novels, 'Time Enough For  Love.'  The two stories involve time travel and are told from different  perspectives, 'Sunset' from Maureen's and 'Love' from Lazarus'.  If you are  a fan of Heinlein and his wonderful ability to create characters, worlds,  and philosophies, this novel will not fail to entertain.  'To Sail Beyond  the Sunset' is simply one of the greatest science-fiction novels ever  written.	2000-07-28

While 'American Front' is another thought provoking alternate history novel it lacks many of the factors that  made 'How Few Remain' and Turtledove's other civil war novel, 'The Guns of  the South,' truly great works.  The characters in 'American Front' are many  and it's easy to get them confused.  Two characters in the novel are  Canadian farmers that seem so similar that it makes one wonder why  Turtledove didn't consolidate them into one.  Also, unlike 'How Few Remain'  and 'Guns of the South,' actual historical characters take a back seat to  Turtledove's fictional creations.  The basic premise itself, that the  Confederate States of America, which won it's independence during the civil  war, goes to war with the United States when thier treaty obligations to  European powers demand it, is a little hard to swallow.  If indeed the  south had gained it's independance from the U.S. the economic desparity  between the two nations would make it almost impossible for the C.S.A. to  keep up with the north.  These points aside 'American Front' has it's  moments.  Turtledove re-creates the Christmas truce that happened on the  western front during WWI and transplants it to America.  Instead of British  and Germans putting aside thier differences during the Christmas season,  it's Union and Confederate troops.  Also, it is interesting to see all of  North America as a battlefield and just how the U.S. would wage a war on  it's own soil.  If you're new to Turtledove 'The Great War: American Front'  is not the best of his novels to start with.  'How Few Remain,' and 'The  Guns of the South' are both far superior.	2000-07-27

The story centers around a crack British commando team infiltrating a Bavarian  stronghold to rescue a high-ranking American officer.  From start to finish  this is riviting fiction.  Maclean's protagonists are the kind of  characters that make you want to cheer and the plot contains enough twists  to keep you guessing right up to the end.

John Toland's facinating biography is must reading for anyone interested in  just how one man could be responsible for such horror.  From dispelling  myths surrounding the death of Hitler's niece, Geli Raubal, and his  involvment in the Reichstag fire, to his ghastly orders to carry out the  final solution, we see Hitler the man.  And while his motives often times  seem unthinkable, Toland nevertheless manages to convey the feelings and  emotions that led to Hitler's unrelenting policies of destruction.  What  truly makes this work remarkable is Toland's presentation of the facts  seemingly without bias.  The facts are presented as they happened and the  reader is left free to come to thier own conclusions.  For decades people  the world over have tried to understand the madness of Nazi Germany.  Toland's biography will no doubt educate and help to give a measure of  understanding to anyone who reads it.  Truly a great work.	2000-07-25

In the war's final months the beaten but not defeated Confederate army is presented with weapons that will alter the course of the conflict- a substantial number of  AK-47's.  General Robert E. Lee uses these new weapons to great affect  against the superior northern armies and eventually wins the Civil War.  However the bearer of these super weapons, a mysterious group of men with  strange accents, clothes, and customs, demand a heavy price.  'The Guns of  the South' is one of the greatest alternate history novels that Turtledove  has written, if not the best.  Although the time travel aspects of this  book do tend to stretch the story's believability, Turtledove nevertheless  produces an amazingly thought provoking novel of a triumphant Confederacy.  Turtledove's interpretation of Robert E. Lee and other historical figures  make this novel worth reading alone.  This novel along with Turtledove's  other work of Civil War alternate history fiction, 'How Few Remain,' should  be read not only by fans of science fiction, but by anyone interested in  the people, events, and politics that made up this pivotal time in American  history.	2000-07-22

Much more than simply a story set in the trenches of World War One, it is a graphic illustration of  a young man's journey from optimism to anguish.  The author is truly a  master of the written word and even the translation into English cannot  diminish his literary skill.  If anyone wishes to have a better  understanding of the generation that served and bled in the holocaust of  the trenches this novel will deliver.  A rare blend of story, character,  and language make 'All Quiet on the Western Front' truly a timeless  classic.	2000-07-07

Set in the bloody English civil war of the 12th century, 'Pillars' spans four decades and the  lives of several richly drawn characters.  The heart of this novel revolves  around the building of a cathedral in a small English village.  The  sacrifice of these humble people to erect a monument to God is nothing  short of inspiring and the tension and drama place this novel among the  great thrillers that Follet is known for.

The story revolves around the adventures of the newly-created Vampire Lestat and his quest to understand  his demonic origins.  His quest takes him around the world and back through  time as other, older Vampires share with him their secrets.  In 'Lestat' we  see a much different being than was presented to us in 'Interview with a  Vampire.'  Rather than the cocky, vain, unfeeling Vampire that we had known  Lestat tells his story with humility and an almost human fraility.  Rice's  sensual writing style and her unwavering ability to probe the darker sides  of the human condition make her an entertaining and thought-provoking  author.  The Vampire Chronicles are truly great works of fiction and 'The  Vampire Lestat' may be the best of the series.	2000-07-04

The stories center around the mathmatical mechanics that allow for the prediction of the future in a statistcal manner-  individual lives remain unaffected, but humanity's future can be charted  and directed.  All this comes to pass as the great galatic empire slowly  but surely fades into chaos.  Only Hari Seldon, creator of this science of  prediction, can save the universe from a galatic dark age.  The short  stories contained in this volume set the stage for the rich universe that  the other volumes fill and explore.  This is the series that testifies to  the genius of it's author and is perhaps his greatest legacy.	2000-07-04

I had seen the movie before reading the book and  was surprised at just how much more complex the novel is.  In addition to  it being Clancy's first novel, it is the first appearence of Jack Ryan.

What is worse Hornblower's conscience is racked with guilt over his  disloyalty to his own wife, Maria.  But before this becomes too much of a  soap opera Forester plunges Hornblower into the dangerous swashbuckling sea  where he uses every trick in the book to ensnare his French opponents.  The  ending is perhaps the greatest cliff hanger in all the series which leads  into the next novel, 'Flying Colours.'

From brilliant sea battles, to duels of honor, to personal fears, this is a novel in great Forester tradition.  The  plot centers on the sea war between America and England in the closing  months of the conflict. After the French Monarchy has been restored the new  republic fears the full weight of the British Empire will come to bear on  it.  It is at this desperate time in the history of the United States that  the novel's protaganist, Captain Peabody, must make a daring escape from  the British blockade in order to threaten British interests in the  Caribbean.  Make no mistake, though, this is not simply a Hornblower  knock-off.  Captain Peabody is an original creation that could only come  from the mind of a master story teller.  For anyone interested in warfare  in the age of the sail this is must reading and fans of great adventure  will no doubt love it too.	2000-07-04

From thwarting an  attempted hijacking to stopping the kidnapping of a Swiss banker to  Battling baddies at a Spanish amusement park, 'Rainbow' is unique in  Clancy's novels as it is almost non-stop action.  This is both a plus and a  minus.  While the pace is fast and the story riveting, some of the humor  and political intrigue that marked his previous novels are missing.  Also,  President Jack Ryan wasn't even given a walk-on appearence.  Even mention  of him was restricted to only 'The President.'

The beginning deals with Jack Ryan's headaches as the number two man in the CIA and waging political battles with the President and members of his cabinet.  Meanwhile, around  the world, communist-arab-native American terrorists recieve manna from  heaven- an atomic bomb.  While most of the novel deals with preparing the  bomb and Ryan's own personal and proffesional problems, The last two  hundred pages are among the most thrilling ever written.  The terrorists'  atomic bomb is only the begginning of a much larger plan to bring the  world, not just the USA, to it's knees.  The payoff of this novel makes the  whole thing worth while.  In addition it acts almost as a manual for  creating your own atomic weapons, should the need arise.	2000-07-01

With 'Redcoat,' Cornwell re-creates an era as only he can, but the story is far  to slow and ultimately uninteresting.  Two of modern literature's greatest  villians, Obidiah Hakeswill and Pierre Ducos from the 'Sharpe' novels,  inspire such hatred and loathing that they make the story's protagonist all  the more heroic.  In 'Redcoat,' however, the reader is one hundred and  fifty pages into it before he knows who the antagonist is.  The characters  are for the most part unsympathetic and the plot really bogs down at times.  That being said it should be noted that where this novel does it's author  justice is in the vivid recreation of the American Revolution.  The  battles, generals, and soldiers on both sides of the conflict are treated  with respect.  The events of this book seem as real as though they happened  yesterday.  For those new to Bernard Cornwell I would recommend reading his  'Richard Sharpe' series first as 'Redcoat' is, unfortunatley, one of his  weaker novels.	2000-06-22

'Hitler victorious' gives several thrilling stories based on  this theme.  While many of the stories are slow and some can't help but  seem a little repetitive, some of the stories rank among the great works of  alternate fiction.  Two of the best stories in the collection, 'Thor vs.  Captain America,' and 'Moon of ice,' make reading this anthology worth  reading alone.  'Thor' deals with the ancient Norse gods appearing midway  through the war and throwing thier lot in with the Nazi's, wreaking havoc  with America's war effort.  'Moon of ice' centers around Josef Goebbles'  harrowing ordeal at the hands of the S.S. in the newly created S.S. kingdom  of Burgandy.

Dickson's Childe Cycle, sometimes called the 'Dorsai novels' is truly one of the great works of Science Fiction.  The early novels begin an exciting series that continue through Dickson's masterpiece 'The Final  Encyclopedia.'  The next two novels in the series, 'Young Bleys' and  'Other' fall far short of the series' first novels.  'Other,' in particular  lacks much of the kinectic drive the was a prevalent device in the other  Dorsai novels.  All of the novels take place in a wonderfly drawn universe  of many worlds and cultures.  What made the first novels of this series  work was the amazyingly complex combination of fast-paced adventure and  well thought out interworld politics.  While 'Other' holds the political  intrigues in abundance it sorley lacks the excitment and exhileration of  the other novels.  'Other' does have it's good points however; it is full  of the multi-dimensional characters that are a Dickson trade mark and has  just enough reference to the events of 'The Final Encyclopedia,' (the two  novels take place simultaniously,) that it is not a complete waste of time.

Dumas' novel is less an action story than a testiment to human endurance, ingenuity, and ultimately, self-forgivness.  The story's  protaganist, Edmund Dantes, is sent to prison on false charges where he  lingers for years.  During his unjust incarceration he mets a fellow inmate  who teaches him, guides him, and also bestows upon him a fortune.  Dantes  uses this fortune to set a plan into action.  For years he has dreamed of  revenge against the men who put him in prison and now he will have it.  More riviting than the web of intrigue Dantes spins to fulfill his scheme  is the deeper quest for self-redemption that unknowingly haunts him.  Retribution and revenge, though important plot points, take a backseat to  Dumas' opptimism in this stirring tale.  Magnificent!	2000-06-06

The look into the Duke  as Prime Minister and confedential advisor to George IV, William IV, and  Queen Victoria never fail to hold interest and passages reguarding  Wellington with his family and children in general are extremly  illuminating.  The Duke of Wellngton was indeed one of Britain's greatest  figures and Hibbert's biography will testify with a great voice to the  truth of that.	2000-06-01

While serving his sentance Speer tells us of the  endless discussions and thoughts about Hitler, Nazi Germany, and failed  military strategies that he and his fellow inmates shared.  Speer also  tells us of the day to day boredom that was his constant companion.  His  insights into Hitler are perhaps the greatest ever produced and the  portraits he paints of Doenitz, Raeder, von Shirach and Rudolf Hess provide  wonderful glimpses into that troubled time.  Perhaps most compelling of all  is Speer's moral struggle with his own conscience; can a man who was part  of such evil truly ever make amends?  Speer relates that his daughter was  invited by a Jewish family to stay with them while she visited America.  To  this, Speer could only cry; hoping that at least to some extent forgiveness  is possible.  Much more than history, this is a powerful look at one man's  search for redemption.	2000-05-28

Dickson's Dorsai novels rank among the great novels of Science-Fiction and 'The Final Encyclopedia' is no exception.

'Encyclopedia' is the  tale of Hal Mayne, a fully-evolved human being who knows what path humanity  must take if it is to survive and flourish.  But before he can implement  his plans, he must bide his time as he makes his way throughout the sixteen  colonized worlds.  But always on Hal's trail is Bleys Ahrens, another fully  evolved human who has his own views on how humanity should progress.  At  the center of this galatic conflict is the Fianl Encyclopedia, a huge  space-station in orbit of Earth, that contains all the knowledge of the  human race.

'Waterloo' is a wonderful tribute to the those who fought the famous battle and a thrilling adventure for  Richard Sharpe.  In 'Waterloo,' Sharpe fights not only the forces of  Napoleon, but the young and inexperienced commander of the Dutch troops as  well as his wife's cowardly lover.  From the tense moments as French troops  cross the  border, to thrashing of the British at Quatre Bras, to the  slaughter of Ney's cavalry on the British squares, to Wellington's near-run  triumph, this is a magnificent blending of historical fact and captivating  fiction.

Instead of sticking only to analyzation of campaigns and tactics, Gilbert attempts to  tell the human story of the war with letters, anecdotes, and poetry, as  well as illustrating the global signifigance of the events on the  battlefield.  Gilbert also tells us how the men who would become the  leaders of World War Two spent the war- from lieutenant Erwin Rommel  fighting in northern Italy to captain Charles de Galle being held in a  German prison to First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill executing  the ill-fated Dardenelles expedition.  Accounts of Adolf Hitler's exploits  during the war are also extremely illuminating.  Gilbert also successfully  conveys the maddness of era that would allow so many young men to die in  the offensives of Verdun and the Somme and allow more than 5,600 men a day  to meet thier end in the entire course of the war.  World War One has been  called the decisive event of the century.  For anyone who would like to  know exactly why this is true then Gilbert's history is must reading.	2000-05-11

Like Christ, 'Stranger's protagonist, Micheal Valintine Smith, points out the  hypocracy of the popular religion of the time.  He teaches the world to  give up the rigid protocals of religion and embrace mankind's most powerful  emotion: Love.  'Stranger' is populated with characters in the rich  Heinlein tradition.  Jubal Harshaw, the kindly sage who acts as Smith's  protecter, is the laywer/doctor/philosipher/writer/soldier/rogue that  brings to mind another Heinlein character, Lazarus Long, from Heinlein's  'future history.'

Deighton also tears down the  myths surrounding Erwin Rommel and explains in detail the breakdown of the  German offensive in Russia.  Rarely has an author made detailed history so  easy to read and understand.

This has the US more than  a little worried as the deal would extend the US/CS border considerably.  After the CS refuses to yeild to the US on this issue war ensues.  Turtledove's knack for creating alternate histories is amazing, and his  treatment of historical figures within those histories is also amazing.  A  Socialist Lincoln?  A beaten Frederick Douglas?  Mormons up in arms?  While  the stories are entertaining the reader must blink his eye at certain  aspects of the history, most notably the fact that the Union and the  Confederacy enjoy a realtivly even economic status.  Also, one of the  fundimental tennants of Mormonism is to obey 'the law of the land.'

Rather than a single novel, it is a  series of short stories revolving around Hornblower's first years at sea.

Besides that, it's just  plain slow.  Throughout an interstellar war the protagonist shifts through  so many jobs that the reader can barely keep up.  He's an infantry man, no,  he's a pilot, no, he's a secret agent, no, he's a false prophet.  While the  ending did have a few nice surprises I fear most readers will have put the  book down long before then, I almost did.

As a biography, Markham sometimes relies too much questionable references, but as a history, 'Napoleon' ranks among the great works on the subject.  The reports of the  battles and the men who served the Emperor are first rate.  One can almost  imagine being at Marengo, Austerlitz or Waterloo, or riding alside Ney,  Marmont, or Junot.  Perhaps some of the most appealing aspects of this book  are the accounts of Napoleon's life after his exile to St. Helena and the  events surrounding his death.  Markham also shows us how the Napoleonic  legend helped to shape post-Imperial France.  I would recomend this book to  anyone who would like to know more about this facinating historical figure.	2000-01-09

Quite simply it is a true fable of evil corrupting good. Throughout Speer's early account one almost feels  that this could be anyone, at anytime.  Only as world events change at an  astouding pace around him, are we reminded that Speer lived in a Germany  that was soon to be the home to one of the greatest evils the world had  ever known.  Speer tells us of the fateful night he first heard Hitler  speak, and how he joined the Nazi party bare hours later.  The portrait  Speer paints of Hitler is not one of the evil demegouge that history would  prove him to be, but rather one of an inspired leader who was doing all he  could to lift his nation out of economic ruin and national despair.  It was  this illusion that Hitler projected that allowed good and honorable men,  like Speer, to be corrupted.  This is an entertaining book for any amatuer  historian, and more, a very important one for anyone who wonders how a  nation of philosiphers, and Christians, aritists and engineers, could sell  it's very soul to evil.	2000-01-09

While many trademark Heinlein-type  characters and moments can be found, it was definatley one of his slower moving novels with not much payoff at the end.  The premise, though, is intriguing.  A  wealthy man dies and is still-living brain is placed in a females' body.  If you are a fan of Heinlein and know what to expect from him, you might  very well enjoy this novel.  But if you are new to Heinlein, may I recomend  'Starship Troopers' or 'Revolt in 2100.'	2000-01-09
