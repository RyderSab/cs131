When I read a romance book especially one with a Christmas theme I want to while reading it and when I've finished it to feel all happy and joyful but I didn't get that feeling from this book the only thing it did was make me mad!!!!!! It's another one of those romance books where the hero and the heroine don't get along and the guy is always right and the woman is always wrong, I found Robert to be verbally abusive and cruel and I felt that the author wanted me to feel sorry for Robert and just think that Gwen was an overly sensetive overly emotional hormonal female for getting her feelings hurt by Robert's verbal insults and trying to stand up to him and defend herself. Why is it in these books that it's always the woman who has to swallow her pride and apologize to the guy and pratically grovel at his feet? I felt that in this Book that it was Robert who was the one who needed to apologize to Gwen! If a guy ever treated me the way Robert treated Gwen I'd tell him to hit the road!	2002-08-19

This book was okay but it's another one of those romance books where someone is deceiving someone, in most books it's usually the woman who is somehow deceiving the guy but in this book it's the guy who's deceiving the woman, Pierce is an actor researching a roll of a blind man and he meets Mollie while pretending to be blind, she really thinks he blind and he hires her to be his helper and continues the charade, while I don't mind an actor having to pretend to be blind to research for a movie I didn't think it was very nice to keep it up as long as he did and kind of string Mollie along, I think the minute he realized he liked Mollie more than an employee he should have been honest with her and told her the truth. Sorry I guess I have just read too many romance books lately where some kind of secret and deception was taking place that I'm kind of sick of that overused plot device and I'm looking for a romance book with more original plot devices.	2002-08-19

Uh, I don't mean to sound rude but someone reviewed the wrong romance novel, Consolation Prize is NOT a historical romance novel, it is a contemporary romance by Catherine George that was published by Harlequin. The characters in this novel are Hilary and Rhodri NOT Abigail and Nate, perhaps she read another romance novel with the same title but a different author. Anyway Catherine George's Consolation Prize with Hilary and Rhodri is good even though Rhodri could be unlikeable at times. Read this book if you can, it's good!	2002-07-29

Good book and quite shocking and disturbing if all that abuse really did happen and I'm not saying it didn't but as with all tell all books I wonder how much of it was true and how much of it was made up just to make a buck off of some famous dead person and as I recall two of Joan Crawford's four adoptive children claimed she physically and verbally abused them but I read in a magazine and also heard on a TV news program that the other two said they weren't abused and that she was a good mother, so who is telling the truth and who isn't is hard to tell.	2002-07-22

The Curious Savage is fantastic and will be a great read, I had the privilege to see a wonderful performance of this play and it is now one of my favorites, My mother's friend played Fairy May who though I liked all the characters she was one of my favorites and had some of the best lines. I actually went to see this play with little excitement thinking I would be bored but I definitely was proved wrong and was just amazed with how wonderful and original it was. I highly recommend the book to not only actors but to anyone who likes to go to the theater and if you ever hear of a performance of this play in your area than definitely go see it, I'm hoping our local theater will put on another production as this is something I will gladly see again and I highly recommend that all stage directors and actors consider putting on a production so other theater goers can have the experience of seeing this wonderful play!	2002-06-01

Grease is one of my favorite movies and I have seen it many times but the book was disappointing and had unfamiliar characters like Sonny's girlfriend Marsha, Sonny didn't have a girlfriend in the movie but I remember him liking Marty and wanting her to dance with him at the dance contest and getting mad when she threw him over for Vince Fontaine, but the main reason I didn't like the book was that I found it a bit dull and it was hard not to compare it to the fantastic movie but that's just my personal opinion.	2002-05-03

I definitely liked the plot though and I hope to buy the paperback book.	2002-05-03

The Magic Of You was somewhat enjoyable, I liked Warren and most of the Malory characters but I was disappointed with Amy she came across as not only being a spoiled selfish immature brat but she was also just too needy and and kind of a wacko, and if Warren came across to some as being a major grouch he certainly had the right to be with his having to deal with Amy's obnoxious behavior, and if Amy hadn't been so annoying I probably would have given the book a 5. Ok, I do like a strong independent heroine who is not afraid to be the pursuer in the relationship but a woman can be strong and independent and be the one who pursues the guy without comng across as being desperate and I didn't find Amy to be a strong woman but more like a bratty child and the thing with Warren was more like an obsession than love and I found her to be a little pathetic and it's a good thing that Amy is only a fictional character.	2002-04-27

I listened to an audio cassette tape version of Viking and though I thought I would probably hate it and think it was hokey I found myself really having fun listening to the story and totally liked it and the fact that Italian actor Marcello filming a movie about the ancient Vikings is transported back to Iceland during the time of the Vikings becoming Viktor the Valiant a Viking warrior, and I really liked Marcello/Viktor, and Monica/Reyna, in fact I liked this audio cassette version of Fabio's story so much I'm going to search the used book stores for the paperback book. My only minor complaint with the audio cassette version is that the American woman who read the story didn't use any accents, and though I would have liked the reader to have used the proper accents I think she had a very nice sounding voice and even with the minor complaint of the accents I still feel that the audio is a keeper!	2002-04-12

The Hawk and the Heather was a good story and I liked the characters Heather FitzHugh and Tanner Montgomery but I can't give it 5 stars because as it's an audio book recording for a Historical Romance set in Regency England I found it strange that the reader did not use an English accent and had a very American sounding accent so I was disappointed as I felt that a proper English accent would have been more approprate to the atmosphere of the story and I could have visualized the story better! The story is about a young lady named Heather FitzHugh who has an intense dislike for Tanner Montgomery, the Duke of Hawksbury a man she has never met but has mistakenly believed that he caused her family's financial ruin and fall from grace and her father's death and sets out to get revenge by catching Tanner's heart and than breaking it and causing him the embarrassment of society she believes he caused to her family but winds up falling for him instead much to her dismay and soon she is plagued by guilt because of her deception to the man she loves and also feeling guilty because she believes that she is being disloyal to her family by falling in love with their sworn enemy! It really wasn't a bad story but the accent thing made the story less enjoyable than it should have been if they had used an English reader or had this one imitate an English accent.	2002-03-20

My second favorite story is Twice Blessed by Rebecca Hagan Lee, it is a nice story, I liked the heroine Lydia Turner and I both liked and at times disliked the hero Thomas Sullivan a doctor who has just arrived from France with his insecure young son, I liked how Lydia was so patient and so caring to Thomas's son Robert but I felt that Thomas could have been a little more understanding to poor Robert's feelings, okay Robert could be bratty but he was only about 4 or 5 years old and scared and lonely, his mother has died and his father who he barely knows and has maybe seen once or twice in his life has plucked him out of his country and brought him to a new country which has got to be scary to a little kid being moved to a new place. Also what was big deal to Thomas about Robert speaking French, sure you would want him to also be able to speak English but what would be so wrong to let him also speak French which is his first language and part of his heritage and also what was the big deal to Thomas about Robert wanting his name Robert pronounced the French way which is kind of like Ro-Bear, I say let the kid pronounce his name the only way he knows, afterall that was how his late mother being French would have  pronounced it. The other story Emma's Day by Jill Metcalf was good and I liked the heroine Emma Parker and the hero Ward Hamilton but it wasn't my favorite of the stories, Ifyou like short romance stories than you will probably like this book.	2002-02-20

I bought the abridged audio tape because I like the actress who reads it, I have seen her on several different soap operas and TV guest appearances and I have always though that she was a good actress but I'm disappointed with her reading of this book she sounded flat and unemotional and used the same voice for each character and I like it when they use different voices for all the different characters so I was just not happy with the audio tape at all and promptly gave it away! I see the unabridged audio tape version is read by someone else but since I didn't like the abridged tape version I definitely will not buy the unabridged tapes!	2002-02-19

I listened to the audio cassette recording of John Vornholt's book and I enjoyed it and was really impressed with Michael Dorn's audio reading, I have listened to many audio recordings in many dfferent generes, Scince Fiction, Romance, Classic Literature, mystery and Supsense etc, but out of all of the ones that I have listened to I was most impressed with his reading, as usual he was great as Worf the character he played but he did a great job with all the other voices too, I especially liked his voice for Emil Costa, I also liked the sound effects they used in this audio and though maybe it wasn't the most challenging mystery I really did enjoy it and I would reccomend this audio cassette recording to any fan of Michael Dorn!

I loved listening to the audio cassette recording of Small Town Girl the one that was read by Lavryle Spencer herself (I haven't listened to the one read by singer/actress Melissa Manchester), the story was wonderful my second favorite with Morning Glory being my #1 favorite. Small Town Girl is wonderful and is about Tess a famous Country singer who comes home to take care of her mother after she has surgery on her hip and runs into Kenny from across the street the guy who was a nerd in high school and had a crush on her but she being one of the cool kids didn't want any part of Kenny and ignored him but now Kenny is handsome and no longer the gawky geek she remembers. I liked most of the characters in this story, Tess, her Mom Mary and her sister Renee, and Kenny and his daughter Casey, the only character I didn't like too much was Judy the other sister of Tess who was a little too bitter and a little too jealous of Tess, I know Judy had a lot of things to deal with like taking care of her own family as well of have taking care of Mary before Tess came home but really did she need to be so petty and catty and rude? Anyway I liked this audio cassette recording so much I went to a used book store and bought the book but have't read it yet but since I liked the audio recording I certainly have to like the book too.	2002-01-05

Not my favorite audio cassette recording of a Lavyrle Spencer romance book but Vows was good and I liked most of the characters but especially Tom and Emily, really the only character that I didn't like was Emily's ditzy friend Tarsy, well she started off ok but than became too whiney and obnoxious!

I liked this audio cassette recording of Constance O'Day Flannery's Time-Kept Promises and I liked the story about the modern day lady named Kris Gavin being transprted back in time and meeting Sean O'Mara and Sean thinking that Kris is his missing lookalike wife who apparently is not a nice person so that would explain why Sean is so rude to Kris and why he is so shocked that the person he thinks is his cold hearted wife is so much nicer and you can understand his being cynical.

US	40884237	R14RF0H68ZEFSL	9994326112	800832404	Love Only Once/Cassette	Books	2	0	4	N	N	Good story, but the audio cassette is disappointing!	This is the first in the Malory series and I'm reviewing the audio cassette, the story itself s very good but the audio cassette version is very disappointing and boring because the American reader did not use English accents and she didn't even bother to use different voice sounds for each character! Love Only Once is about a young lady named Regina Ashton who by mistaken identity is abducted by Nicholas Eden who mistook her for his mistress and winds up tarnishing Regina's reputation which infuriates Reggie's very protective uncles the wealthy and powerful Malory brothers who later appear in their own stories in this series. I rate this 2 stars beause of the reader's lack of English accents and not making her voice sound different for all the different characters! The audio cassette is abridged and I really hope they rerecord it unabridged and with the proper accents and interesting changes of voice sounds!	2002-01-04

Even though it is a very abridged audio cassette only 1 tape and about 90 minutes I liked the story and thought they did a great job within such a short time and I really enjoyed listening to it and since I was having trouble reading because a family emergency left me with no time to read and the stress was making it difficult for me to concentrate on reading which was vey hard because I was such a major bookworm I decided to try listening to audio cassettes in the hope of jump starting myself into reading again and I just thought this was the perfect length and I'm glad I listened to this tape and I liked the characters the guy named Seth Colter and the lady named Morgan Wakefield	2002-01-04

I listened to the audio cassette recording of Gentle Rogue, the third story in the Malory series and the story in general was good but the reader's lack of English accents and the fact that she didn't even bother to change the sound of her voice for each character was kind of distracting and a bit dull, it was fine for Georgina and her brothers to have American accents but Englsh accents should have been used for James and the rest of the Malory's! The story is about a young American lady named Georgina Anderson who goes to England and falls for James Malory the pirate who is not on the best of terms with his family because they don't approve of how he makes a living and are embarrassed by it. I rate this audio cassette version only 2 stars because of the reader's lack of accents and differences in voices and I would have given it 5 stars if the reader had done that! The audio cassette is abridged and I really hope that Johanna Lindsey decides to have it rerecorded uabridged and with the proper accents and differences in voice sounds!	2002-01-04

I listened to the audio recording of The Magic of You and though the story itself seemed interesting the reader because of her lack of English accents and not bothering to make her voice sound different for each character was annoying and distracting, it was fine for Warren, his sister Georgina and their brothers to have American accents but Amy and the rest of the Malory's should have had English acccents! The Magic of You it is about a flirty and kind of ditzy young lady named Amy Malory a niece of the Malory brothers who falls for an older American man, Warren Anderson brother of Georgina who is married to James Malory who is not to happy about young Amy's infatuation with Warren and when both Amy and Warren disappear he immediately assumes that Warren abducted Amy and sets to go after them but unknown to him Amy and Warren have actually been kidnapped by a ruthless enemy of Warren. I rated this a 2 only because of the reader's lack of proper accents and different voice sounds and if they had been used I could easily have given the audio version 4 stars.

This is the second in the Malory series and I listened to the the audio cassette and though the story was good the reader's lack of English and Scottish accents and that she didn't bother even to make her voice sound different for each character was annoying and kind of boring! The story is about a young Scottish lady named Roslynn Chadwick who flees her beloved home in Scotland to escape from being forced to marry a creep who wants her money and land, she goes to England and runs into Anthony Malory a man with a reputation for being the love em and leave em type but soon Roslynn finds herself falling for Anthony and they both find themselves involved in adventure, mystery and suspense when the creep comes after Roslynn. I give the audio version 2 stars just for the reader's lack of accents and different voice sounds and if she had I would without doubt have given it 5 stars!

I agree with the other reviewer that this is a wonderful Cinderella type of romance story and no one writes a better Cinderella romance than Betty Neels! The book is about this young English lady named Cressida Preece and she has a nasty step-mother who treats her like dirt but than Cress meets a handsome Prince-Charming in the form of Dutch doctor Aldrik Van der Linus and he falls for Cress and sets out to give her the happy life that she deserves! There are two characters named Tyco and Charity Van der Brons who are friends of Aldrik and they first appeared in an earlier Betty Neels book called the Final Touch and I wish I had known that before I read this book as I would have read it first and than I would have read A Happy Meeting but anyway I did really love this book and I recommend it but just make sure you read A Final Touch first and than A Happy Meeting! I haven't read A Final Touch yet but since every one of Betty Neels books that I have read so far has been great I'm sure it will be great too!	2002-01-02

I didn't find the Quiet Professor by British romance book author Betty Neels to be stale at all and I really liked it, Sure some of her books have different characters in the same situations like an English nurse falling for a Dutch doctor but her books are so well written that each books situations always seem like it's totally new and I really liked the characters, the English nurse Megan Rodner and the Dutch doctor Jake Van Belfeld and in this book instead of being written as a girl plain in looks Megan is described as being very pretty so to me that is different than a lot of Betty's books where the plain or homely girl falls for the handsome doctor and wins his heart even though I still love her plain girl handsome guy love stories and I love reading about what is the same and what is different about the medical field in America and Europe! I highly recommend this sweet endearing book!	2002-01-02

US	40884237	R2VC0VP2CL0XRN	0671887939	816692709	Remember Me	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Wonderful.	I listened to the abridged audio cassette recording of Mary Higgins Clark's Remember me, read by actress Megan Gallagher and it so far my favorite Higgins Clark story, it was a joy to listen to not only because Mary Hggins Clark is such a great writer but also because Megan Gallagher has a nice pleasant voice which is always a plus when listening to an audio recording of a great book, there is nothing worse than listening to an audio recording of a fantastic book than when the reader has an annoying flat unemotional voice so I'm so glad that Megan Gallagher read this book with as much emotion as if she was making a movie or appearing in a TV show because she really made me feel as if I was listening to a movie and really made me feel sympathy for Menley even though she is a fictional character and I highly recommend this audio to be listened to as well as reading the book! I was also lucky to get the the unabridged audio recording from books on tape that normally is about 56 dollars or higher on sale for about 20 dollars which some people even think that is pricey but it was worth it for me because though I love to read I also love to listen to audio recordings but because I have been extremely busy I haven't yet found the time to listen to it but I'm going to try and make the time soon, that is one of my New Years's resolutions to make more time to sit and relax and enjoy a good book or audiobook!	2002-01-01

This is another wonderful book by English romance book author Betty Neels, her books are really a delight to read and I have found them quite addicting, I can't get enough of them and I'm always looking for her older books in used book stores which isn't always easy as the few used book stores in my town have long waiting lists for her books and as soon as they get her books they are gone, and they rarely get her books anyway because most people like her books so much that they keep them and won't part with them for anything! I was lucky to have found a copy of A Kind Of Magic that was in good condition and it is a really great book and I like the characters a guy named Fergus Cameron and a young lady named Rosie MacDonald and I like how the story took place in England and Scotland because as much as I like her books that took place in England and Holland the locale of Scotland was a welcome change.

I was looking at my old Little Golden Books seeing if I had any that my niece would like read to her, one of the books I found is Puppy On The Farm and and it is very good, it's a cute story about a puppy who lives near a farm and how he trys to get the farm animals to play with him and how he learns a valuable lesson at the end of the story. When I was little I loved my Little Golden books and this is one of my favorites and is a great book especially for children who like dogs so I'm sure my niece will love this book.	2001-12-27

I found some of my old Little Golden Books hoping to find some that my niece might like read to her and Micky Mouse The Kitten-sitters was a favorite of mine that my friends had given to me when I was sick. In this story Minnie goes to visit her cousin Millie and leaves her kitten Figaro at Mickey's house where he and his nephews Morty and Ferdie have to watch her kitten. Minnie thinks her Kitten is the most well behaved pet but as soon as she leaves Mickey, Morty and Ferdie soon discover that Figaro is anything but well behaved and he causes much calamity. Though I really liked this book I remember when I was little not liking how Minnie was such a grouch and yelled at them and wouldn't believe them that all the trouble was caused by Figaro and her refusal to listen to them and her blaming everything on Pluto really ticked me off and I remember that bothering my nephews as well when I read it to them but it's still a good book that apparently is out of print these days.	2001-12-27

WOW, this is one amazing book, Karen Lockwood really knows how to write a book where you get lost in the book while reading it and you feel as though you are right there and a part of it! The story is set near Yellowstone National Park and is about Jennie Beasley a young but uptight and fussy school teacher and Nate Dennison a wealthy Northener who moves into town and builds a big house that the neighors make fun of because they think it's too much and think he is a fool so they nickname it Nate's Folly, but when the school is destroyed by a fire Nate lets Jennie use the downstairs part of his house for a temporary school and Jennie learns that things aren't always what they seem and that Nate is a nice guy and he is trying to repopulate and protect the buffalo which are in danger of becoming extinct. I really llked this book and it is a keeper for sure!

This was a favorite book of mine when I was a little girl and I have very fond memories of my parents reading it to me at bedtime. I wanted to buy this book for my niece but I'm a little leary of that because of the reviews about the threat of a spanking the father in the story uses to get Frances to go to bed as for the spanking part in the book either I just don't remember that part at all or maybe my parents skipped that part when they read it to me, and if they did read that part obviously I wasn't traumatised by it and I still have fond memories of the book maybe because I was like Frances a major procrastinater at bedtime who took a long time to finally get to sleep! So though I liked this book I would be careful of who it was bought for, definitely not a book to give to a child who's parents only like politically correct childern's books. Though I still have fond memories of the book I do understand why some feel uncomfortable by the spanking I Know someone who while reading the nursery rhyme The Old Woman Who Lived In A Shoe to her nephew and having liking it when she was little but she was dismayed by the line she whipped them all soundly and sent them to bed but instead of not allowing him to hear the whole nusery rhyme she read it to him but skipped the whipped them all soundly part so the same thing can be done with Bedtime For Frances you can just skip the spanking part.	2001-12-16

Marianne Winchilsea is in hiding because her father has been arrested and falsely accused of being involved in a crime and the greedy power hungry villains who are really responsible are out to get Marianne, she disguises herself as a gypsy and meets Garret Lyon, they are both mistrustful of each other at first but fall in love and Garret helps her clear her family name and investigates the villains! Though I liked the story the fact that the reader didn't use an English accent is why I rate this with 3 stars instead of 5, and an English accent would have made it more believable!	2001-11-08

I felt so sorry for poor little Megan the sweet little girl who was abandonded by her selfish, uncaring parents, but then Megan stepped through the magical gate and was transported to medieval England and finally found a loving and caring family and they changed her name to Gloriana and she was wed to Dane and even though he didn't have feelings for her at first you know it wouldn't be long before he fell for the beautiful, sweet Gloriana. There were some things in the audio book I personaly found to be too explicit but I still liked the rest of it.	2001-11-08

A First Time For Everything is one of the best romance books I've read, I immensely enjoyed the book and really liked the characters a guy named Thane Addison and a lady named Josslyn Harding. I recommend this book, it's out of print so like me you'd have to find it in a used book store or maybe someone has a used copy to sell and you can read all about the love story of Thane and Joss.	2001-11-08

Enchanted by Elizabeth Lowell was good but not the best audiobook I've listened to! Ariane and Simon are the romantic pair and I liked them just fine, I enjoyed the audiobook for the most part and it's being condensed to one tape didn't really bother me as much as it has bothered other reviewers prehaps because I knew I was buying it condensed on one tape but actually what bothered me was that the woman who did the reading didn't use an English accent, the bottom line is if you are making an audiobook recording of a romance book set in England you either need to have the reader be from England or have the American reader put on an English accent! I would recommend that people who like audiobooks of romance book's set in England to be read with an English accent to just buy the book, unless the fact that the reader didn't use an English accent dosesn't bother you!	2001-11-08

Well I have no problem with Romance Alive Audio's abridged audio cassettes I have listened to plenty that I have liked but I didn't like The Tea Planter's Bride, not because it was abridged, but because the story was just not enjoyable I didn't like the creepy plot involving the evil, perverted villain! Anyway I'm glad I only listened to a very abridged audio cassette and I didn't listen to an unabridged audio cassette or read the book!	2001-11-08

Firestarter was a fantastic book I really enjoyed reading it, I also loved the movie starring Drew Barrymore as Charlie but I liked the book a little more then the movie, I like the book also because it's not really scary it has it's spooky moments but nothing that would give you nightmares, I thought the story was also sad with what they did to Charlie and to her parents. I very highly recommend this fantastic book which I could not put down!	2001-10-31

I once saw the movie on TV, it was very good! I don't remember the names of the actors who were in the movie but I wish it would be put on video and DVD.
