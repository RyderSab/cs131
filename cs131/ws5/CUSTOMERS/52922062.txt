Ever wonder what a police officer is thinking in any given situation? Randy Sutton compiles a wide array of varying views from  police officers around the U.S.  <br />In their words, they describe situations that are funny, harrowing, heart wrenching, loving and more. You won't want to put the book down, but will need to in order to open a new tissue box. <br /> <br />Bravo to Randy Sutton for a wonderful collaberation of gifted story tellers and writers.

Finished this tonight and was astounded that the intro claims<BR> this is only the second published book by Ellis.  It is very<BR> accomplished writing of an old pro, in my opinion.  Mr. Ellis must have<BR> served some sort of apprenticeship in some other area - it is that good.<br /> So many things to like about the book; structurally, very short chapters<BR> (I really appreciate those) which all flowed together masterfully.  The<BR> protagonist is a very reluctant new lawyer who is drug rather kicking<BR> and reluctantly into a power structure and among wolves and sharks, and<BR> just seems to grow into the development of the plot.  Sticks it out,<BR> keeps surprising himself, but will not sell out to \\"the Powers That Be\\",<BR> having an internal set of values which he follows.<br /> That is was all \\"meant to be\\" for him is a great plot and character<BR> development...and the ending is truly unique.<br /> Top it all off, it is a Serial Killer book in a genre which I had<BR> thought to be impossible of innovation after so many had been written;<BR> and yet this stands out as a \\"one off\\" which depends on none of the<BR> many, many books in the genre (I have read most of them).<br /> Hats of to Mr. Ellis, everyone rush out a buy a copy of this.	2002-09-29

Perhaps what drew me to this in the first place was tone- 19 children die in a bus accident. As a mother of a child who died, perhaps I was searching for common ground. It really doesn't exist as you are in a world of your own. But the book was very well written nonetheless.	2001-07-04

Via Tom Bethany, the non working workaholic,  he inserts some thought provoking insights into the heated debate of abortion. Perhaps the most frightening part is the antagonistic characters may be ousted from Jerome's book and placed into the world and we would be able to identify them.  Jerome knows how to weave a story and fill it with humor, comraderie, and perhaps even a touch of wishful thinking.	2001-07-04

The pro bono civil rights organization called The Innocence Projects raises many thought provoking arguments as to whether the Death Penalty is a good thing after all. The most surprising thing to me when reading these cases, was just how long it still took to free the innocents even when undisputable proof cleared their names.

Perhaps it's the way he grabs you right from the beginning. We are jolted into the story with this opening:  &quot;Like any other university, Harvard sucks. What makes it a great university is that it sucks harder than most.&quot; Tom is drawn into the eco &quot;save the tree&quot; issue when an important peaceful leader is being threatened. Perhaps I enjoy his books due to wishing this modern day Robin Hood existed. Perhaps it's because all books in his series can stand alone. Perhaps it's the way many important issues are brought out to the foreground to be thought about and explored. Or most importantly, perhaps it's the way in which Doolittle weaves words with wit, wisdom, adventure with a touch of reality thrown in to boot.	2001-07-04
