It should be essential reading for those allegedly educated many who think the Renaissance somehow erupted full blown in the 15th century without the important previous groundwork outlined here. True, it's not easy reading, but then again, this is not a beach novel. Particularly fascinating to me is the clear presentation of the relationships between political power and what now seem like obscure, even laughable, theological controversies. They were more serious and far-reaching than I would have imagined. Terrific book!	2004-01-07

I had hoped to find out more about these things here. As it turns out, Williams is not interested in any of that, but only in what can be reconstructed of the Arian crisis of the 4th century. In this particular realm, the book is very informative, if excruciatingly detailed, in its discussion of Arius' place within the continuum of the ancient collision between revelation and Greek philosophy. In some ways, this is a refresher course on Plato, Aristotle, Philo, Origen, Plotinus, and a number of other polytheist and monotheist speculators as to how god relates to the world and how this can accord with Judeo-Christian writings. Williams ultimate concern seems to be to get us to orthodoxy, and to relate this controversy to more modern theological concerns. So while it was of some interest historically, the final impact of this book on me was twofold: 1)it made me very glad I had gotten out of the seminary before spending years learning the intellectual gymnastics  required of theologians to conceptualize and define the inconceivable and undefinable, and to reconcile the unreconcilable; 2) and it pushed me to finally read the Koran: I now understand where Mohammed was coming from!	2003-12-29

Books	5	17	20	N	N	You Won't Do Better	This translation of the Koran by Ahmed Ali is about as good as it gets for the English-speaking reader. Out of all the translations available locally, (and I compared many, side by side, passage to passage), this is IT. True, Ali does hang on to a generally archaic tone, but no more so than 'Lord of the Rings' does. 'Haply' and 'verily' are peppered throughout the text very much like the 'hark's and 'lo's of the JPS Tanakh. 'Compeer' is a regularly occuring word (has any contemporary English speaker used THAT in a sentence lately?). My favorite is 'obliquities'. Nonetheless, these things do not interfere with the basic clarity and readability of the translation. And unlike a couple of readable versions done by non-Muslims, Ali communicates a great deal of cultural and literary information sensitively and with style. Other reviews give me the idea many Christians are reading this for indications of the barbarity of Islam. I guess the savagery of the Hebrew Bible is insufficient for them. Christians might be better served by reading the Koran for its statements about Jesus, Mary and the Trinity. Mohammed's views do not represent his personal, idiosyncratic views. They represent sectarian Christian traditions that were alive and well in his time: that Jesus did not rise from the dead, nor was he the son of God. Read your books carefully!	2003-12-25

To me, it might be called a godsend, since I first tried a headlong assault on an unabridged version, which quickly wore me down with its endless examples of words with multple senses and anthropomorphic references to God. Where's the beef? I wondered. This edition gets the novice reader straight to the meaty matters Maimonides considers, such as whether the universe was created or not, what the nature of prophecy is, what can be understood or even said about God, how the Bible can be reconciled to philosophy, and how traditional practices are to be viewed. His answers won't satisfy fundamentalists, either Jewish or Christian, but his discussion is always challenging, and mostly clear-minded (he lost me with many of his thoughts on the spheres, since in this area he was manifestly out of his depth). This abridgement is about 1/4 of the original, but the arrangement has a good, logical flow. The 1940's-early 50's translation is very readable, though the scriptural quotes leave something to be desired in the clear, modern English department. One additional factor that jumps out at me from the text is the sheer force of Maimonides personality. (I have the feeling he wouldn't approve of me studying him, but his work may yet have a salutary effect on my life, reluctant as he would have been to teach someone like me!) Be prepared to meet a great man.	2003-11-23

It requires only persistence and attentive reading, so it fits in well with my later-life schedule and personality. The other reviewers find some more faults with the method than I do, probably because I know less, and am not that worried about accents yet. But then again, as far as I can tell from looking at photos and facsimiles of old manuscripts, they had no accents! My only objection to Dobson's book here is his translation philosophy. He consistently and persistently recommends the very type of paraphrased, approximate and (to me) dubious translation practice that has driven me to get the hang of Greek and Hebrew to begin with! I don't see the point of totally obscuring the oddities and richness inherent in ancient language usage just for the sake of smooth, denatured English.	2003-10-24

At the same time, the book does collect a wide variety of Roman writings from all phases of its development and collapse. I've never before run across the Twelve Tables(450) BCE, anonymous rituals, Josephus, St. Augustine, Hannibal, Pliny, Suetonius, Marcus Aurelius, Horace, Caesar, Cicero, Juvenal, Constantine and too many others, known and anonymous, to name, all in one volume. It's main problem is that some of these translations are so hoary it's hard to imagine anyone ever expressed themselves in such convoluted and ornate language. Hannibal's speech to his troops is a prime example: it is unlikely his troops would have understood what he said, much less been motivated to valor, if he actually talked like he does in the translation here. Most of the pieces are good enough, though. It's fun to browse through, to get a peek at what Romans thought of themselves, and ordinary things they did, as well as great ones. The chronology at the front is very handy, too.	2003-09-17

On the other, it has a great deal of importance to say to anyone who reads the Bible either as a literary or inspirational text, to anyone interested in the parallel developments of what we now know as Judaism and Christianity, or to anyone who wonders just how we got from offering children and animals as sacrifices, to offering prayers instead. It's a big change! The book is divided into three parts. The first, 'A Father's Gift' sets the issue of child sacrifice into historical contexts around the Mediterranean and examines the practice and literature on the topic in Biblical Israel. The second, 'Beloved Sons in Genesis' examines the fates of beloved sons and their brothers: Abel and Cain, Isaac and Ishmael, Esau and Jacob, and Joseph and his siblings. This is the most difficult section, as Levenson minutely dissects the relevant texts, often going beyond what he really needs for his argument. The writing is dense, but ultimately fascinating and something to keep in mind always as you read the Bible. Being a beloved son is a heavy fate. Part III, 'The Beloved Son Between Zion and Golgotha' deals primarily with the sacrifice of Isaac (or not!) as it was retold and rewritten in Hellenistic, Rabbinic and Christian texts, to enlightening effect. Take your time with this one. It's worth it.	2003-09-16

On one hand, it's pointless reviewing this Penguin edition, because the only translation of Plotinus that is generally available and widely quoted is Stephen Mackenna's legendary, rhapsodic life-work presented here. This abridgement is still lengthy (500+ pages) and probably more of Plotinus than most readers want, but there it is. Armstrong's translation, available only at high price for many volumes, in the Loeb Library, is more literal. But as far as I know, the only time selections were made from that set, in an all English edition, was 1953, by Allen and Unwin. It was a gem, and I'm sorry I lost it. So this IS Plotinus.	2003-08-31

In the book, Cohen avoids reading back into the Bible itself and considers a great deal of other historical and literary evidence to determine when being a Jew changed its meaning from 'being from Judea', the geographical location, to 'being a member of the Jewish religion'. He finds the first traces of this in the Hasmonean period, expansions of it in the Roman and up through history. Along the way he is also tracing the beginnings of Rabbinic Judaism after the fall of the Jerusalem Temple, which is quite different from what constituted Judaism before that event. All of this would probably be very surprizing to those who hold anachronistic visions of Jesus as a Rabbinic Jew!. Cohen also goes into quite a bit of detail on matrilineal descent and conversion, maybe more than some would want, but interesting nonetheless. Good book.	2003-08-31

As such, the book is more of a collection of related articles rather than a sustained argument. Two of the chapters are essentially extended reviews of other works: one on the JPS Torah Commentary, another on 'The Book of J'. Others give hints on how to read the books of Samuel as literature, on Biblical poetry, on the necessity of the literal in translating the bible (although this makes me wonder why Alter chose to use the non-literal, anachronistic title LORD for YHWH in his translations), as well as general considerations of the range of biblical literary forms, their meanings and uses.

At first I found it a little dry and underemphatic, but as I continued reading, I became thoroughly engaged by its clarity and precision. As a literal reading, the Dover edition is a lot more readable than Loeb's Haines translation, and more direct than Staniforth's Penguin edition.

It is the fussiest, pseudo-archaic travesty of translation I have ever encountered. Never mind that the use of 'thee', 'thou' and the accompanying creaky verb forms have been out of vogue for over half a century, Haines mined the motherlode of obscurities and what I suppose is would-be poetic creativity. Thus you will encounter words like 'encairned', 'decensive', 'quotha', 'perforce', 'wroth', 'guerdon', and 'aye'(used like pepper throughout the text), all of which may be summed up in Haines' funniest quote,'Man, what art thou at?' It's hard to imagine that even in 1915 this translation did not seem ridiculously effete for a work of such practicality and clear sense! It is equally remarkable that Loeb had not modernized this turkey by 1987, anyway. If you want to consider the Greek text, this is the one to get. Otherwise you will find better and clearer English elsewhere!	2003-08-15

Philip Amidon has wisely chosen to focus on the presentation of the many, many heresies Epiphanius took on, while leaving out the refutations. The result is a highly readable history of the diverse movements that made up early Christianity, and Epiphanius himself in these pages is something of a Herodotus of heresy, chatty and digressive, yet always interesting. Perhaps the most surprizing aspect of this volume is that it essentially, though perhaps unintentionally, refutes the standard version of church history which presumes an unbroken, unified, apostolic orthodoxy deriving straight from Jesus, which scattered heretical groups diverged from. The picture I got from reading these pages, so much more complex but at the same time reasonable, was that 'heresy' was so widespread as to constitute the normal matrix of Christian belief and practice, while orthodoxy had to fight for survival using every intellectual and political tool available. If this volume were more available and more popularly priced, it might raise more than a few Christian eyebrows!	2003-05-20

Mr. Smith examines conceptions of the divine family and council of the gods, more general notions of ancient aspects of divinity, and the roles of various divinity. Especially insightful is his critique of James Frazier's category of \\"dying and rising\\" gods in the Near East. In his analysis of Isaiah, he gives considerable background into Mesopotamian views on the divinity of statues of gods, whithout prejudice. There is a lot more than I can list here in this book, but if you're interested in how the idea of one, all-powerful god came about, this is really essential reading.	2003-05-10

In &quot;The Early History of God&quot; Mark Smith systematically sifts through archaelogical and literary data from Bronze and Iron Age Palestine, the Mediterranean, and Mesopotamia to find the earliest evidence for YHWH, his cult, and his context. Chapters include discussions of YHWH and El, YHWH and Baal, Asherah and asherahs, cultic practices, such as communication with the dead and child sacrifice, at the sites where YHWH was worshiped, as well as a brief discussion of the beginnings of monotheism during the late monarchy. Refreshingly for me, Smith frames his argument on available evidence, not on wishful thinking, and the result is provocative and stimulating. The long introduction to this new edition covers the debate that has gone on since the book was originally published over ten years ago, and the extensive footnotes are a wealth of information on every side of the discussion.

The Hebrew text is ultra-clear, the English type is very attractive, and both the English and Hebrew are well-spaced for ease of reading. Notes are good. The Hebrew text occupies the right column of every page and verse numbers are in standard Arabic numerals. The student edition, listed above as paperback, is actually the same as the leatherbound version, but with a plastic, leather-textured cover.  The JPS translation is almost compulsively readable, with some reservations.  It is generally faithful to the sense, if not always the words, of the Hebrew text. YHWH is rendered as LORD, the bull of Jacob is still denatured into the mighty one, but at least Shaddai is Shaddai!  And when the reader feels the translation has moved too far into the abstract, the Hebrew is right there for comparison and study.  There is, however, a very peculiar aspect to the JPS translation. While the introduction calls this an idiomatic translation for our time, the English is peppered with archaic terminology more appropriate to the Elizabethan stage and difficult crossword puzzles than to ANY spoken or literary English of our time.  I have to wonder in what circles &quot;hark&quot;, &quot;lo&quot;, &quot;hither&quot;, &quot;sojourn&quot;, &quot;adjuration&quot;, &quot;levir&quot; and other goofy, but poetic, words constitute idiomatic language. &quot;Levir&quot; doesn't even rate its own entry in my Webster's collegiate dictionary.

John Barclay is consistently even-handed and fairminded in his considerations of literary and archaeological evidence from the Greco-Roman period, describing a vivid picture of the diversity and unity of Jewish communities in Alexandria, Rome, Cyrene, Anatolia and Syria, as well as the shifting fortunes of these communities under the various regimes. A great deal of the pseudepigraphic literature is examined in detail. The chapter on Paul as a Jew in a Hellenistic society, though short, is more enlightening than several books. Barclay's assessments of, and disagreements with, other scholars work are such that scholarly writing could acquire a good reputation if others would emulate them. The style is as accessible as it is informative. Now I wish Mr. Barclay or someone like him would write similar books on the Pre-Exilic, Exilic, and Persian periods. I can dream, can't I?	2003-01-04

He opens with an analysis of I & II Maccabees, to see that the Hasmoneans were not opposed to Hellenism per se, but that they in fact utilized Hellenism to further Jewish ends. Gruen goes on to examine the creative adaptations of Biblical materials by Jews to help place them in the context of Hellenistic society and thought, emphasizing their antiquity and superiority in that world. Other materials discussed are from Josephus, and the Jewish Pseudepigrapha, often little-known fragments of historical lore, Greek additions to Daniel and Esther, and the Third Sybilline Oracle. Gruen looks insightfully at his sources, wonders how they were intended and who they were for. He finds elements of satire, humor, consolation, and exhortation in these remote works. Many of the footnotes are in Greek, but can be looked up in translations by chapter and verse numbers. In a few places Greek is used in the text, but this should not dissuade the general reader. Overall, the book is very readable, fair-minded, and potentially helpful to anyone wishing to understand the Judaism of this period in history.	2002-11-09

This isn't exactly light reading, due ancient prose style, the condition of the tablets and the limitations of the translators, but the letters do provide a unique window into a small period of the Bronze Age. Particularly compelling (and annoying!) are the 70 or so letters of the perpetually beleaguered mayor Rib Hadda, who was apparently under siege and begging for help from Pharaoh for several years straight. Besides letters from mayors of towns under Egypt's influence, there are some from Assyrian kings, and a couple from Pharaoh himself. Fundamentalists often refer to the references to the Apiru in these letters as evidence of the Hebrews, but once you read these, it becomes apparent that the Apiru designate mercenary outlaws who ranged throughout Canaan, Syria and Anatolia. Why anybody would want to claim that these Bronze Age Hole-In-The-Wall- James-Gang-type outlaws were God's chosen people is a mystery to me.

When I opened Andy Gaus' translation of the New Testament, and began reading Mark, I literally experienced a shock, whether of the spirit or of  recognition, I can't be sure.  Mark's headlong, atemporal enthusiasm burst off the page as I had always imagined it should, but never had, in any other translation.  Further reading of other books continued opening facets of these texts I had only guessed at. Gone is the theologically anachronistic language of standard translations (and Lattimore) which puts concepts into the text that weren't there when it was written.  In Gaus, churches are assemblies, repentance is a change of heart, baptism is bathing, gospel is the good word, angels are (often) messengers, spirit can be breath, and so on.  The translation is sometimes less literal than I would have liked, but translation is always a balancing act, and overall, Gaus has found a great balance for the reader who doesn't know Greek and is frustrated by the jargon which encrusts most New Testament editions.  I don't know anything about Mr. Gaus, or who he is associated with, but my hat is off to him.  For me, this New Testament is right alongside Richard Elliott Friedman's Torah.	2002-10-27

It gave me a much better sense of the styles of the various authors, and perhaps, even of their personalities. In many ways it is fresher and more readable than the church-approved translations, while at the same time being pretty literal. That being said, however, it's not quite as fresh as all that. Even though, for instance, Lattimore's avowed goal was to let the Greek style dictate the English style, Mark's use of the historical present in telling his stories is nowhere in evidence. In other words, despite the fact that Mark wrote in a narrative style which resembles that used in my old neighborhood (&quot;And he says to me...&quot;, or &quot;Then he goes...&quot;) for some mysterious reason, Lattimore, like virtually all other Bible translators, wants us to read Mark as a more elegant writer than he actually was. Why? In the arena of vocabulary, too, Lattimore makes a number of capitulations to tradition which are far from fresh. A prime example is the word 'ekklesia', which Lattimore, like every standard version, translates by the exclusively Christian term 'church', even though 'ekklesia' was a generic term for any group of people meeting/assembling for any purpose, sacred or secular, public or private, lawful or unlawful. Why use a misleading term like 'church' which suggests an institution and organization which was not yet  contemplated in the first century? Similar theologically and culturally anachronistic views are reflected in other word choices, and even in capitalization practices, which again, were not thought of at the time the NT was written. I still am looking forward to the day that a translation allows the Biblical text to speak its own language, without pushing agendas not actually present in the text!	2002-10-19

They were faced with genocidal policies of a new Marxist regime, centuries-long bigotry from the ruling Christian Amhara tribe, and what amounted to criminal negligence on the part of the Israeli government in regard to recognizing the Falashas as Jews and rescuing them. Rapoport spells this all out in the first chapter, and after this, moves beyond advocacy journalism into the realms of ancient history, folklore, Biblical and rabbinic traditions, and anthropology. This all makes very fascinating reading, as well a strong case for the Falashas legitimate, longstanding claim to being Jews. Along the way a lot of unusual information comes out about Jews as pariah metalworkers, about intercontintental migrations through the centuries, as well as the numerous non-rabbinic, Torah-based Jews in Africa and Asia. The book ends more or less where it begins, with the modern discovery of this remote tribe. Now I wonder how it all turned out, since this book was written 20 years ago.	2002-09-28

Yonge translation of the complete works of Philo of Alexandria until I could stand it no longer. Because Yonge worked in the 19th century, I thought his work would be as stilted as Hendrickson's Josephus by Whiston. I was wrong. Yonge's translation has been updated here by David Scholer to accord with a text discovered after Yonge wrote, keyed to Loeb Library numbers, with passages unavailable to Yonge newly translated. The text occasionally creaks, but it generally very readable, and actually enjoyable (not something that can be said of most ancient philosophical/theological texts!). The more modern Winston selections from the texts and their superior notes in the CWS edition are still excellent to have, but you really need to read more complete treatises to get into Philo's remarkable, even amusing, mind.	2002-08-24

From the oldest fragment of an Egyptian book c.2600 BCE, through clay tablets, papyrus, leather and parchment scrolls, to codices (that is, books as we have come to know them) in the early centuries of the Common Era,  from prehistoric and non-literate symbolic/memnonic schemes, through early writing systems of Africa and Asia, to alphabets and scripts, Diringer examines every bit of evidence that was available up to the early 50's, when the book was written, to reveal archeological, cultural, linguistic, and religious trends through the millenia, and how scribes functioned, in their various settings, to bring us what remains of of distant literary past. He delves into the remotest corners of the globe for unexpected insights and manuscripts. Illustrations are abundant and well-described. I can only wonder what an edition updated to include all the most recent discoveries would be like. Probably huge!

I fear the reviewer above who managed to finish the book knowing next to nothing about ancient Persia is saying more about herself than this book.  I was chiefly interested in the religious and cultural aspects of the Persian period, rather than the military and political ones, and I have come away from this book considerably more enlightened than I was by Edwin Yamauchi's treatment of Persia.  Olmstead is both a vivid and readable writer, witty, detailed and fair-minded.  His treatment of the Zoroastrian religion was eye-opening for me, and the way he deals with Palestine and Egypt was also illuminating. I especially got a kick out of his paraphrase renditions of some ancient documents and inscriptions at a purely aesthetic, and somewhat humorous, level. I'm sure there's still more to know, but this is a terrific overview.	2002-07-30

However, it is really informative and clear in ways that other, more famous or convenient editions, are not. The main difficulties involve a Legge's use of a system of transliteration no longer in use, (having been superceded at least twice in the past century), lack of page headings, an odd layout of footnotes (which begin at the end of each section of text being discussed, and the separation of all commentaries by ancient authors into appendices.  If this sounds like a list of complaints, it is not.  Most volumes of the I Ching put the various commentaries on each hexagram on the same page as the hexagram and oldest text, creating what is, in fact, a false impression of unity.  Although the format is not to modern standards, this volume is very helpful to the understanding of the I Ching in particular, and the history of Chinese thought in general.	2002-07-20

The introductions are extensive, and except for what appears to me to be an odd system of transliteration, illuminating.  The book as a whole is organized to present texts concerning major figures in the religion in an orderly fashion rather than in their (I gather) extremely mixed-up later format.  Translations are clear insofar as this is possible, and where the texts are really obscure, Malandra indicates this.  This book is very short (fewer than 200 pages), but extremely clear and fair-minded (as opposed, say to Edwin Yamauchi's discussion of Zoroaster), and definitely worth having for anyone interested in the ancient near east.	2002-07-20

I was expecting more of the same.  However, I was soon won over by the clarity of Nidich's thinking, the order of the presentation and the strengths of her arguments.  The overall thrust of the book is to examine the nature of literacy in the very ancient world, to distinguish it from modern notions of literacy, and to consider how the interplay of oral culture and writing exhibits itself in the Bible.  Perhaps the best thing I can say here is that this tiny volume is causing a major shift in my thinking.  While she does not pretend to comprehensive knowledge of the process of compiling the Bible, she does raise a number of practical considerations against the Documantary Hypothesis variatons that I daresay the authors of purely literary theories have never even remotely thought of.

Halpern's basic contention here is that the Former Prophets, the the historical part of the Bible running from Judges through Kings, is a work of historiography, composed by a historian weaving together older sources(annals, stories, chronicles, inscriptions, etc.) into a coherent historical work during the late 8th through 7th centuries, which was subsequently edited in the 6th century BCE.  This basic contention, could be well-explained in one good chapter.  However, that is not what happens in the book.  This theory is alluded to throughout the text, while Halpern defends it against every doubter, past and present, by going into small sections of the Deuteronomistic history, in often excruciating detail. This approach can be alternately fascinating and exhausting, and almost demands that the reader already have pre-formed opinions as to what is going on in specific passages, who wrote them, and why the author may have done what he did.  At the same time, Halpern neglects some very basic questions about the texts he analyzes, and fails to help modern readers realize what their fundamental job IS: &quot;to get back into the mental state of the historian's ideal audience&quot;.  Nowhere does he explain the society he says this history was written for!  All that being said, though, if you DO have deep background, you may very well be able to get more out of this book than I did.

Leo Oppenheim's &quot;Ancient Mesopotamia:Portrait of a Dead Civilization&quot; is one lively read.  It is not a chronologically arranged history, (you'll have to go to Georges Roux's &quot;Ancient Iraq&quot; for that), but it is an unusually comprehensive series of essays on aspects of ancient Mesopotamian civilization.  After introducing Assyriology as a discipline,  Oppenheim situates Mesopotamia geographically and culturally within the ancient world, and discusses its relations with and influence on its neighbors.  From there he goes on to analyze the root forms of almost everything we know of as civilization: urbanism, political and social organization, religion, writing, literature, and scientific thought.  Particularly interesting are the discussions on the care and feeding of the gods, ancient psychology, and the scribal subculture.  Throughout the book, Oppenheim refers to historical and literary data of every sort in an even-handed way.  A helpful chronology, glossary, notes, and index fill the final 100+ pages of the book.

In this volume, Daniel Matt translates a small selection (2% of the work by his own estimate) into rhapsodic and rapturuous, truly air-borne free verse. The effect is both surprizing and exhilarating.  The only comparable approaches I can think of that might put you in mind of the nature of this translation are Stanley Lombardo's Homer and Stephen McKenna's Plotinus.  But lest I create the impression that this book is only pleasure, the introduction to Kabbalistic thought in general, and the Zohar in particular is quite illuminating, as are the detailed notes on each selection placed at the end of the book.

First, the price is very attractive, being less than half that of other bilingual Bibles I have seen.  But the real selling point for me was the literal quality of the translation, including having proper names transliterated straight from the Hebrew without regard to conventional usage, and the fact that even the visual arrangement of the translation directly mirrors, most of the time, the exact arrangement of the Hebrew text.  The translation is generally old fashioned, based in general on a 19th Century translation, but updated to reflect modern usage and recent linguistic research.  The Hebrew text, according to the introduction, is definitive as of 1962, and free of previous errors. The order of the books, for Christians reading this, is Judaic: Tora, Prophets and Writings, rather than the Septuagint order used in churches, and this in itself provides additional food for thought.<br />In short, this Bible is a valuable and cost effective version for the serious student and curious reader who wonders &quot;What does the Bible really say?&quot;	2002-04-12

Essays cover the relation of kinship to covenant, traditional narrative, the dubious fortunes of Reuben, the old gods of the ancient near east, OT descriptions of the tabernacle tent and temple in context, highly technical essays on Hebrew verse, two essays on the post-exilic restoration with an emphasis on the rift between Samaria and Jerusalem, two essays on the fixation and stabilization of the canonical text, and kind of an afterthought essay on pottery sherds and alphabets.<br />For me, the most interesting articles were the 'olden gods' essay, which places a number of themes present in the Bible firmly in the context of Canaanite mythology, and the the Samaria essay, which brings a lot of insight to the &quot;Samaritan Problem&quot;.  Just about as compelling are the essays dealing with the canonization of the Biblical texts, which brings the Dead Sea Scrolls and other contemporary evidence in to clarify the conerns and procedures.  The most difficult and arcane (and beyond my interest) were the essays dealing with Hebrew verse.<br />My reservations stem from what seem to me to be omissions in the argument.  Cross regularly makes the statement &quot;there is no reason to doubt&quot; one thing or another which is by no means proven, either in this work or any other that I know of, regarding practices and institutions of the &quot;tribal league&quot; and the &quot;empire&quot;.  He alludes to the existence of tribal leagues and their distinct religious forms from the Bronze Age to the modern era without much discussion of evidence.  He also attests that at Ugarit patriarchal and specifically urban forms co-existed.  This is interesting and I would like to know more about it.  If the tribal and urban practices mingled throughout history, this does not give us &quot;no reason to doubt&quot; the historical accuracy of a Biblical account in which patriarchal religion and politics totally gives way to some national type of religion, nor does it help secure the dating of patriarchal narratives, or the dating of the conversion to Yahwism of Canaanite mythic themes.  Cross's assertion of an orally transmitted prose epic seems unlikely, and no evidence is presented here to change my mind.<br />My reservations do not decrease the value of this book, however.

It is conservative in that it takes the general framework of the Biblical chronology as accurate, and Cross refers readily to &quot;patriarchal folk&quot;, &quot;the league&quot; of tribes, &quot;the empire of David and Solomon&quot; and the &quot;divided monarchy&quot;.  Within this conservatism, Cross adheres to the relative conservatism of the Documentary Hypothesis, which is taken for granted by most scholars, but anathema to those who hold to the unity of the scriptures.<br />The book is radical in that Cross isolates themes and expressions derived from Canaanite mythology, particularly from mid-2nd millenium tablets found at Ugarit, written in an alphabetic script.  He delves deeply into the names, titles and attributes of God, as well as into various sources which were united in the Bible as we now know it.  &quot;The Song of the Sea&quot; rates a special chapter in which Cross demonstrates the independence of the poem from the story that surrounds it.  He also reconstructs archaic precursor poems to various Biblical texts.<br />The book is challenging in that it is quite difficult and detailed.  When I got started reading &quot;Canaanite Myth...&quot; 6 months ago, I quickly realized I didn't know enough to read it, so I took a few months to acquaint myself with the rudiments of Hebrew and middle-Eastern archaeology.  Hebrew text, transliterations of Ugaritic, discussions of etymology and usage, sources of scribal error, and so on, using technical terms  are the stuff of the volume, so it's not nearly as simple or neat as a least one of the other reviewers has suggested.<br />Finally, the book is debatable in that the reconstuctions  of archaic texts based on the text we now have, the oldest exemplars of which date  from the Hellenistic/Roman period, and projecting them backwards a millenium, and deriving political and ritual presumed practices from them seems to me highly speculative and ultimately dubious.  For instance, while Cross does successfully demonstrate that &quot;The Song of the Sea&quot; is independent of the J and E sources, without more data, how can anyone possibly know at what point the poem became Yahwistic?  The author cites archaic usage in dating, but it does not escape me that in our own culture, which is much less conservative than ancient cultures were, right into the 20th century, virtually all religious texts were translated into pseudo-King James English, which itself was archaic in 1611.  Without securely dated copies, how would any future scholars date these?  At the same time the book raises a number of issues which merit further study.

In this book, Richard Elliot Friedman gives us the material of the J source, combined with the 'Court Historian' printed as one work.  His J is slightly different from the J of the  Bloom/Rosenberg version in omitting the Balaam story and the plagues, but he explains in textual notes that he is unable to separate the J strands in these stories.  Beyond J, he gives us some of Joshua, some of Judges, much of Samuel and a teeny bit of Kings (the accession of Solomon, but not his reign). In the past, these two sources were often regarded as related, but not necessarily from the same hand.  Friedman explains his reasoning, for uniting the sources, and the books do go together well.  His translation is admirably simple and consistent, and makes compelling reading.<br />I'm not sure I agree that J is really the first historian or that his(or her) writing represents the first prose masterpiece, because even this source seems to me to be spliced together from other sources, and its methods and concerns seem grounded in other concerns than those of history or prose.  The density of wordplay, the webs of free association and the frequent interjection of proverbial material link it more to poetic and wisdom literature than history.  The plots, if you will, are a by-product of the play of language.  I'm sure more work can be done on these sources, and it will be equally interesting.<br />As to editorial problems, it seems like Harper has a policy of making many of its Bible-related works more inaccessible than they should be.  There are no descriptive headers on the pages to give you a hint as to what particular story or standard Biblical book you are looking at on any given page. Moreover, there are 91 textual notes for which NO indication is given in the text.  Are we just supposed to intuit the note's existence?  As it is , I spent a few hours preparing the book for use, but isn't this the EDITOR'S job?	2001-12-27

The book contains a series of essays in which he deals with objections to his earlier writings, makes a few objections of his own to other writers, and generally illuminates the nature of oral transmission, the interaction of literate and non and illiterate societies, the power writing  gives to those who have it, and its influence on conventions such as time, narrative and poetry.<br />This book is of particular interest to me in relation to the Bible, because for years in the seminary I always heard that the laws of Moses, the stories of Genesis or the sayings of Jesus were transmitted verbatim because of the allegedly superior memory skills of oral cultures.  Mr. Goody takes dead aim on these naive notions, and the theories of Lord and Parry, by looking at actual oral transmission in actual oral societies.  It turns out that word-for-word recall of ritual recitations is non-existent, and rhyme and meter are likewise in short supply. In the observed societies, mythic recitation is collectively composed by intiates at the time of performance, and varies considerably from time to time and place to place.<br />Other issues considered in the book are the creation of narrative time through writing, the influence of writing on the slave revolt in Bahia in 1835, a critique of Derrida's playful, but not very accurate notion of language, and consideration of writing as a technology.  This book was very hard to put down.  It's a keeper!	2001-12-19

This book lets you know all the translations of any given Hebrew word in the KJV, and of course, it's easy to transpose this information to any other version.  All Hebrew words have Strong's numbers, and Names are contained in a separate index at the back.	2001-12-19

It contains a representative sampling of Pyramid and Coffin texts, monumental inscriptions, didactic and wisdom literature,including the famous &quot;Dispute Between a Man and His Ba&quot;, a few hymns, and prose selections, including &quot;The Story of Sinuhe&quot;, &quot;Three Wonder Tales&quot;, and &quot;The Shipwrecked Sailor&quot;. For me the clincher in deciding to purchase this particular volume over its competitors was Ms. Lichtheim's decision to leave the words &quot;ka&quot;, &quot;ba&quot;, and selected other terms untranslated rather than giving anachronistic, supposed modern equivalents, to these complex words, as other recent translators have done.  There are, additionally, excellent introductions and notes.	2001-11-29

It's short, readable and incisive.  In pursuit of the main subject, how literacy alters culture and consciousness, Mr. Goody takes us through a sharp critique of anthropological theory and literature, particularly dualist reductions in classification.  Then he examines modern transitions from oral to literate culture in West Africa, and most interesting to me, brings us back to the birth of writing and classification in the ancient Near East and Mediterranean. Some trip! This book is not just for social science grad students.	2001-11-21

While he did not succeed in changing my mind, he did offer some informative literary and liguistic analysis on possible points of Egyptian influence in specific sections of the Bible.<br />His opening chapters, where he compares Mesopotamian, Canaanite and Egyptian myths, are the most problematic.  His method seems fundamentally flawed, especially in what appears to be his assumption that ancient religious views were monolithic, standardized and national, rather than diverse, varied and local.  One myth and its deities succeeded another as kingdoms and empires formed and dissolved.  In his comparison of Biblical creation theory with the water-based Mesopotamian versions, he very strangely ignores what the Bible actually says in Gen. 1:2 about God hovering over the waters which already existed in order to push a creation ex nihilo view, which all 3 Jewish Torah commentaries I have consulted repudiate. And then when discussing cosmology, he ignores Genesis, which is quite in line with other ancient middle eastern views , and cites Job and Isaiah.  Lastly, when he says that the relatively minimalist view presented in Genesis could not have derived from elaborate Mesopotamian schemes, he seems to be forgetting the reformist impulse which the Bible clearly represents. In our own history, the eleborate Catholicism of the middle ages eventually gave way to puritanisms of various types.  According to his theory, Protestants should be even more baroque than Catholics!<br />In any case, given that any state in the ancient Near East conducting relations with it neighbors would of necessity have had scribes versed in both Egyptian and Mesopotamian writing systems in order to communicate with them, it seems like a no-brainer that ancient Israel would have had access to the ideas of both cultures.  Additionally, Egypt dominated and meddled in Palestine for cenuries.  How could influence have been avoided?<br />As to the body of the book, Currid zeroes in on particular<br />stories and forms, such as Potiphar, plagues, incidents involving serpents, war itineraries, widsom literature and prophecy.  Here the book becomes more interesting to the reader who is curious about ancient words and their meaning, and ancient customs and views.  It's not by any means comprehensive, but I'm not sure that would even be possible.tures.  Additionally, Egypt dominated and meddled in Palestine for cenuries.

However, in &quot;Scribes and Schools&quot; he keeps himself fairly well restrained and highly referenced.  The result is a book that, while not conclusively definitive, intrigues the reader with a wealth of possibilities about how the canon of the Bible grew into the one we are familiar with today.<br />He starts by introducing us to the idea of canons generally, moves to those who controlled the technology of writing in the ancient world, a hereditary international class of scribes attached to palaces and temples, and how they operated in the fairly well-documented societies of Mesopotamia, Egypt and Greece.  He then reviews various approaches taken by scholars regarding these issues in Judaism, and summarizes Israelite and Judean history from the monarchic to the Roman periods.  The remainder of the book is devoted to specific divisions of the Bible: the Torah, Prophets, Widsom Literature and Apocryphal writings, taking into account the libraries at and around Qumran.  The final chapter considers the final form: the transition of canonical collections of literature into Holy Books as we now know them.<br />The book is fairly short, written in a rather dry, academic style, and good enough to recommend to anyone thinking about the Bible's growth into its present form.  Sometimes Davies is insightful, as when he suggests a Persian period date for the composition of Deuteronomy on the basis of its diminished notion of the role of the king, which would have been unsuitable for a monarchic state but well-adapted to a colonial one.  Other times he is less so, as when he suggests that the oldest parts of 1Enoch were composed at the same time as the oldest parts of Genesis, since it is quite clear in comparing these texts that they come from totally different literary and conceptual universes!  Davies also refers to obscure sources which is very interesting, at least to me.eresting, at least to me.	2001-11-15

Others include its size (ca. 850 large pages) and high quality as a book, and, of course, its contents, which range from Homer to Augustine.<br />About 2/3 of the volume is devoted to Greek literature, with about 200 pages of that being Homer and Hesiod. Early poets are  well represented from Sappho to the obscure.  A complete translation of &quot;Antigone&quot; is included, as well as a generous sampling of other plays by Aechylus, Euripides, etc. Herodotus, Thucidides, Plato, Aristotle and many little known Hellenistic items appear.  From Rome, Vergil, Lucretius, Marcus Aurelius, and various poetic and theatrical works.<br />The book does leave you wanting more.

Mr. Redford takes an even-handed approach with his materials and considers various viewpoints.

You may find out more than you ever wanted to know about the battles between Persians and Greeks!<br />As far as the Bible is concerned, the authors seem primarily interested in the historicity of Ezra-Nehemiah, Esther, and Daniel.  There is also a minimalist analysis of Zoroastrianism, which concentrates on scholarly disputes about when Zoroaster lived and the lateness of the texts we now have.  All in all, the approach on this argument reminds me very much of the line taken on the Bible by recent minimalists/revisionists!  A chapter on the Magi closes the book out, focusing on Matthew's Infancy narrative.<br />I was really hoping for more information on Persian cultural and literary traditions and how they interacted with the traditions of the exiled Judeans, but larger questions are not really dealt with.<br />All this being said, however, the book contains information you won't find elsewhere, the many photographs are fascinating, and the book as book is of excellent quality.	2001-10-31

I had been particularly struck by the straightforwardness of his &quot;Hidden Book in the Bible&quot;, and the virtues of this approach are apparent in this Torah.<br />The commentary is interesting and insightful, although it frequently only whets my appetite for more.  And the mere presence of the Hebrew text has caused me to start learning Hebrew to experience the sound relations among the words. It has rapidly become clear, even in my limited state of comprehension, that the text is composed like music, and much more is going on there than merely telling stories and listing regulations.<br />I'm sure there can be no definitive translation or commentary on this, the most heavily worked over text in history, but this is a fine place to start.	2001-10-31
