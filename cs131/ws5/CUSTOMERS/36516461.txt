There Roanna meets and falls in love with her distant cousin, Webb Tallant. First she hero-worships him as a child and then as an adolescent she has a teenage crush on him. However, Webb was always destined to marry another cousin, the beautiful but tempestous Jessie. The wedding goes as planned but when Jessie is found murdered one evening in her bedroom all fingers point towards Webb. Webb decides to leave the family home and heads for Texas.<br /><br />Ten years pass and Roanna is now grown up and Lucinda is dying. Lucinda's dying wish is for her beloved Webb to return to the family home and to take over the business from her. Roanna heads off to Texas to persuade Webb to return home. Webb finally decides to return with her but tongues start wagging and old gossips are dug up. With Webb's return, Roanna starts receiving new threats. Is Jessie's killer still a danger to the Davenport/Tallant family? Will Webb ever return Roanna's unrequited love?<br /><br />This was an explosive read. The chemistry between Webb and Roanna sizzles and sparkles. Their sex scenes are graphic but also romantic at the same time. Although I agree with other readers that the incestous scenes between father and daughter could have been toned downed. The southern family saga was a great storyline. It was like watching a good old episode of Dallas or Dynasty. A very highly recommended read. You can't go wrong with Linda Howard.<br /><br />Lea Ling Tsang	2005-03-29

She has to be in order to support her mother and siblings. She has no time for herself oftens neglects her health. Whilst photographing the ocean, Cat meets the handsome and debonair Travis Danvers.

They spend a great few days together but Travis wants her to drop everything so that she can go sailing off into the sunset with him. Being the sensible girl that she is, Cat cannot drop her work for him.<br /><br />Basically, the story is about Cat and Travis falling in love and trying to learn to trust each other. Both have been badly let down in previous relationships and both are distrustful of the opposite sex. Other than that not much happens. Which is why I found the story rather dull. Altough there is a heartwrenching twist towards the end of the book which saves the book from being a complete flop.<br /><br />Lea Ling Tsang	2005-03-29

Professor Robert Langdon, on business in Paris, is called to the Louvre Museum late one night, after closing hours. He arrives at the renowned museum and is greeted by police detective, Bezu Fache. Fache shows him the curiously arranged dead body of Jacques Sauni&egrave;re, brutally murdered, former curator of the Louvre. Not long afterwards, Sophie Neveu, French cryptologist, arrives on the scene. She gives Langdon a secret message and shows him a vital clue that the police have ommitted to disclose to Langdon: \\"13-3-2-21-1-1-8-5 O, Draconian devil! Oh, Lame saint! P.S. Find Robert Langdon\\" A clue left behind by the dead man but what does it mean? One thing is for sure and that is Langdon is now chief suspect of the crime. Sophie must help Langdon escape the clutches of the police and unravel a succession of clues leading to the great secret held by the dead Jacques Sauni&egrave;re.<br /><br />Secret societies, cryptic clues, theories challenging the foundation of the Christian Church and the Bible all go into making this a fast paced and fascinating but rather far-fetched read. The Vatican has, as of March 2005, recommended against reading this book which will no doubt add to its notoriety and thus increase sales figures. However, I believe that it is just a piece of harmless fiction, although some devout Christians may find it offensive and/or laughable.<br /><br />Lea Ling Tsang	2005-03-16

Returning to her home one evening, Grace witnesses the murder of her husband and brother by her boss, Parrish. Unknowingly and unwittingly she has been translating texts leading to the secrets of the Knights of the Templar, guardians to a secret treasure hiding untold wealths and power. Grace then goes on the run realizing that the police will not believe her story and that she will be prime suspect of the murders due to the nature of the way the bodies were arranged after death.<br /><br />As Grace goes underground, constantly changing identities, she uncovers more details of the ancient script, leading her to a formula to travel back time and to discover who was Black Niall, knight of the Templar and guardian of the treasure. She does indeed travel back to the Middle Ages and meets Niall and must somehow change the hiding place of the treasure so that Parrish does not discover it in the future and exploit its unlimited powers.<br /><br />I did not find this book as engaging as other books I have read of Linda Howard. There were too many gaping holes. We were never really told what the \\"treasure\\" was and what it did although it was hinted at that it might have been the holy grail and the holy shroud. I couldn't understand why Grace returned to the past to be with Niall when she could have gone into another past to save her beloved husband and brother. Still it is worth a read if you are a Linda Howard fan.<br /><br />Lea Ling Tsang	2005-03-15

Niema is used as a decoy to get into Ronsard's mansion to plant a bug. John builds up a disguise as an infamous terrorist to get in touch with Ronsard.<br /><br />As John and Niema become deeply involved in the danger and action of the chase, they find themselves unable to deny their attraction for each other. Niema knows that any involvement wth John will only lead to heartache and disappointment for John cannot lead a \\"normal\\" life.<br /><br />It is always a pleasure to read a Linda Howard novel. The suspense and sensuality is an explosive combination. Miss Howard sure knows how to turn up the heat. John was a real sexy hero as with all Linda Howard heroes. Being both strong and sensitive at the same time. Niema could hold her own as well. However, I was not impressed with the ending which rather confused me. The villain did not get his comeuppance which defeated the whole purpose of the big CIA operation in the first place. However, still an extremely entertaining read.<br /><br />Lea Ling Tsang	2005-03-15

He does not want to love her and does not want to fall prey to his sins of lust. Time and again Isabel is hurt but Richard's rejection.<br /><br />I found this book very slow going indeed. It played out like a medieval soap opera. I would read say a 100 pages and then speed read through the next 100 pages, hoping for story to pick up. It never did. I was very disappointed because I bought this book from reading the other reader comments. It's very rare that I give a book less than 3 stars but this book I found rather tedious. Give it a miss!<br /><br />Lea Ling Tsang	2004-11-14

He visits her in the night to watch her sleep and finds her exquisitely beautiful and would like nothing more than to take her in his arms but he stops himself. He lavishes her with ornate presents each day and Gwedolyn finds herself falling in love with her mysterious captor. As the identity if the \\"dragon\\" is revealed to the villagers, Gwendolyn does her best to protect her \\"dragon\\".<br /><br />This was a beautifully written story. A twist on the Beauty and the Beast theme. It was nice to read that Gwendolyn was no waif but a real curvy woman that the \\"dragon\\" found beautiful.

Fortunately for Zach, Tears Like Rain, a young Cheyenne woman feels pity for him and asks the chief Cheyenne, White Feather, to release Zach so that he may become her slave. White Feather agrees and Zach becomes a slave to Tears Like Rain.<br /><br />As Zach spends more time with Tears Like Rain, he notices that she is in fact white just like himself and not Cheyenne. Her skin is white, her natural hair colour is sable but covered with black dye and her eyes are grey. He discovers that she and her brother Wind Rider were adopted by the Cheyenne group when they were children after their parents had been slaughtered by Crow Indians.<br /><br />The Cheyenne are a dwindling race and it is proposed to White Feather that his group of people move to a reserve a Sand Creek. White Feather agrees with the army to move his people to Sand Creek in return for living in peace. Zach does not wish for Tears Like Rain who he now knows as Abby Larson to move to Sand Creek. He wishes to introduce her back to the White world where he believes that she belongs. White Feather agrees with Zach even though Abby wishes to remain with the people she grew up with. Zach takes Abby away to the nearest white settlement. Zach finds himself falling for the headstrong white Cheyenne and Abby does her utmost to rebuff him but she too finds herself falling for the handsome officer.<br /><br />I found this book to be an average romance. Zach was a galant hero but I found Abby/Tears Like Rain a rather annoying character. I just couldn't warm to her. There are a couple of steamy sex scenes but I couldn't really find the love story hidden under the lust story. Read it if you really enjoy native American Western romances but if like me you're not a big fan, give it a miss.<br /><br />Lea Ling Tsanga miss.  <br /> <br />Lea Ling Tsang	2004-11-12

She is self suffient, growing her own vegetables, enough to feed herself and to sell to the local grocery store in town. The rest of her land lies fallow but is much prized by the local ranchers for its lush fields fed by the abundantly flowing creek.<br /><br />One of those ranchers is the dark and handsome Lucas Cochran, who owns the most prosperous ranch in the area.

Lucas is not the only person after Angel Creek. Others in the area will try all ways to persuade Dee to give up her beloved land, even violence.<br /><br />I loved the character of Dee because she is such a strong heroine, looking after herself and protecting her land. Lucas was a real gentleman and treated Dee as an equal, even though she is not from the same social circles as himself. Their encounters are sensual and passionate.

Hercule Poirot and the local police are called in to investigate the matter. Could the jealous husband have murdered her or perhaps it was the long suffering wife. Could it be that Arlena was blackmailed by some unscrupulous cad? Could she have stumbled across a smuggling operation at the cove? Hercule Poirot fits the pieces of the puzzle together. Amongst the clues are a pair of scissors found at the scene of the crime, pieces of a green calendar and wax in the fire grate in one of the guests rooms, an empty bottle thrown out of a window, the sound of bath water draining from a tub at midday.<br /><br />This is classic Agatha Christie at her best.

After the death of her father, Faith answers an advert to become a mail order bride. She finds herself leaving Michigan and setting off for a long journey to small town Deliverance, Texas. There she is met by handsome wealthy rancher Nicholas Shepherd and his mother Liza.<br /><br />Faith finds herself homesick after spending days alone with the cold and resentful future mother in law whilst her husband is out working. How Faith wishes she could be out helping Nicholas rather than being stuck at home with the non too communicative Liza doing women's work. But Faith prays nonetheless for Liza and Nicholas even though they are not very welcoming. For she believes that she has been sent to Deliverance by the Lord for a purpose.<br /><br />Time and again Faith and Nicholas's wedding is postponed for unforeseen reasons. Faith starts to think that her purpose of coming to Deliverance wasn't to marry Nicholas but to teach a local blind boy how to read braille. Faith decides that she would like to set up a school for the blind but runs into trouble with Liza and is thrown out of the house whilst Nicholas is away selling cattle. When Nicholas returns he is angry with his mother but is too proud to bring back Faith. Will he put aside his proud nature and ask Faith to return to him? For Nicholas already misses Faith just as much as she misses him, even though they have spent little time together.<br /><br />This was a sweet romance with a Christian message. There are no sex scenes as with most romantic novels but then this is a Christian romance and I think that this makes a nice change. Lust is not an element here but more about human relationships and relationships with God. Looking forward to reading the sequels.<br /><br />Lea Ling Tsang	2004-10-05

She travels to the small town of Calamity in the Wild West to confront the man who she believes ruthlessly gunned down her baby brother. In a run down saloon in Calamity she finally comes face to face with Billy Darling and as the local sherrif refuses to arrest Billy, she is left to do the job herself. She points her little derringer at Billy and fires straight at his heart and faints at the same time.<br /><br />Esmerelda wakes up in the local jailhouse and is again confronted by Billy Darling, the outlaw. He manages to convince her that he has never seen her brother in his life, let alone gun him down in cold blood. Esmerelda hires Billy to track down her brother, Bartholomew Fine III. Together they set off to find Bartholomew and have an adventure of their lifetime, coming across the Darling gang (Billy's four older brothers) and a crooked marshall.<br /><br />This was a fabulous read. I love Westerns when they are well written and Nobody's Darling is one of the finest Western romances I have ever read. Billy is a real gentleman outlaw cast against the lady Esmerelda. Their romance was a pleasure to read and there was plenty of humour to keep you chuckling along. The secondary characters,especially Billy's brothers were also a real hoot to read about. A highly recommended read.<br /><br />Lea Ling Tsang	2004-10-03

Her boyfriend of the last few years has just dumped her because she is not right for his image, being size 18 and all. While she is drowning in tears, the most handsome man she has ever seen walks into her shop. Vane Kattalakis is in fact not a man but a were-hunter (werewolf) who set his eyes in Bride in a previous Dark Hunter novel and believes that she is the most strikingly beautiful woman he has evern seen. Seeing her in tears, he buys her a $600 necklace from her shop and offers it to her and walks out of the shop.  Bride chases him down the street with the intention of returning the $600 back to him stating that she cannot not accept such an expensive gift. They end up having one passionate interlude in the back of her shop.<br /><br />Vane walks out of the shop a second time believing that he will never see her again as she is way above his station. Later that evening a mark appears in the palm of his hand. The same mark mysteriously appears on Brides hand aswell. This mark signifies that Bride is Vane's mate and he has all but 3 weeks to convince her to become mated with him, otherwise Vane will have to live a solitary life without any female for the remainder of Bride's life.<br /><br />Vane decides to appear in his wolf form to protect Bride, for the rest of his pack will attack her if they know that he has a potential mate. To complicate matters, his father and his mother both want him dead, as a result of their unwanted relationship. Vane's mother and father come from opposing clans of were-hunters.<br /><br />This was my favourite dark hunter novel so far. Vane is such a gentleman and it's nice to read that Bride is not your usual stick thin twig but a real plus size woman with all her curves and all. Vane really does respect Bride and is real knight in shining armour and we all dream of one of those, don't we? The fact that he is drop dead gorgeous is a plus aswell.

Not long afterwards her dreams are invaded by this gorgeous Dark Hunter. The dreams are so life like that they are almost real. Wulf has been ordered to protect Cassandra, as the last in the line of Appollites, the World will end if she dies.<br /><br />I didn't like this book as much as the other in the series. I found some of the details confusing. If the World will end as Cassandra is the last in long line of Appollites, then what about all the other Appollites we meet in the underground city? However, the relationship between Wulf and Cassandra was quite touching. A good read nonetheless.<br /><br />Lea Ling Tsang	2004-09-28

He has been sentenced to death by the Goddess Artemis but Acheron, Zarek's boss has asked that Zarek be judged before he is condemned to death.<br /><br />Astrid, a nymph is sent to Alaska to judge Zarek. Her sight is taken away from her to that she is not hindered by it when she judges Zarek. Will she find enough decency and compassion in Zarek to find him innocent or is he beyond redemption. Astrid is horrified to learn about Zarek's tortured past through his dreams. He was beaten and maimed as a Greek slave and was loved by nobody. He has never known kindness or compassion and thus lives his cold life without emotions. Astrid strives to melt the coldness in him and to give him her love and kindness.<br /><br />To further complicate matters an Appollite called Thanatos has been sent by Artemis to kill Zarek, even though Zarek has yet to be judged. Danger is coming at Zarek from all corners as he struggles to stay alive and protect Astrid.<br /><br />This was a very touching story and you could feel Zarek's pain as the story unfolds. You could sympathize with Astrid for wanting to hold him and to take away his pain. This is probably the most touching in the series so far. There is lots of action too and great fight scenes. The dialogue is witty and fast, a trademark of Sherrilyn Kenyon's style. A highly recommended read.<br /><br />Lea Ling Tsang	2004-09-15

I found neither Ronin nor Kalial very endearing and couldn't really care for these two characters. However, the sex scenes were very graphic and very hot, although sometimes out of context of the story. I found myself speed reading just to read the sex scenes. There's even a scene where Ronin and Kalial's horses have sex. Enough said!

Michael Hosea is a hardworking farmer and a Christian. He has been praying to God that he may find a wife. One day God sends him a message to marry a prostitute called Angel from the local town of Pair-A-Dice. Angel was sold into prostitution at the tender age of eight after her mother died. She has known no other life other than that of selling her body to the highest bidder. Each night Michael goes to the brothel to bid for half an hour with Angel. Only he's not buying for half an hour of pleasure of her body but time to talk with her and to persuade her to marry him. Angel does not want to marry Michael but cannot get him out of her mind.<br /><br />  Time and time again Angel refuses Michael's proposal until one day she is badly beaten up by the brothel's bodyguard and is left for dead. Michael marries her and takes her away to his farm. There she slowly recovers and learns how to to do household chores and farming. She also learns of the love that Michael has for her. However, this is not enough and she runs back to Pair-A-Dice and returns to her old life of prostitution. Michael comes chasing after her and brings her back to his home even though he catches her in bed with a customer. He is heartbroken but loves her and loves his God who tells him to look after her. They settle back into their comfortable life on the farm and Angel finds herself falling in love with her husband who teaches her all the ways of the farm and shows her how to enoy life like watching a simple sunrise. Also he does not make love with her until he feels that she is doing so with her heart rather than doing a job.<br /><br />  The power of Michael's love frightens Angel and she does not want herself falling in love with him as her mother was heartbroken by her father. She does not want to believe in Michael's love and ends up running away again and again. Each time Michael runs after her and brings her back except for the last time when Michael feels that Angel can only be free if she chooses to come back to him by her own free will. Michael also believes that Angel must find God before they can live a happy peaceful life together.<br /><br />  This was a powerful love story. Both between Michael and Angel and also between them and God. This book is based on the book of Hosea in the Old Testament and tells us of God's uncoditional love for us. It made me pray for all the abused children in the World. Michael is probably the most selfless person you could meet in a book. Time and time again he forgives Angel and takes her back as his wife despite her betrayals and loves her unconditionally. This is an amazing book with a powerful message of God's unconditional love for us. A very highly recommended read. I shall be looking for more books by Francine Rivers to read.<br /><br />  Lea Ling Tsangfeels that Angel can only be free if she chooses to come back to him by her own free will.

She is sent away on holiday by her father to the Pacific Islands. Hank Wyatt is an escaped convict from a high security prison on one of the Islands. They are travelling on a ship when the boiler blows and the ship capsizes. Hank manages to get to safety on a lifeboat and also saves Margaret and three orphaned children, Lydia (11 years old), Theodore (5 years old) and Anabelle (just under 2 years old). They sail in the lifeboat until they finally reach a deserted island.<br /><br />When Hank and Margaret meet sparks fly. He is a hardheaded man and will not listen to Margaret's opinions and she is determined woman who will not let any man put her down. Margaret knows nothing about children or cooking and so will ocasionally lose one of the children and more often than not burn the food. Hank is a hard man and has lived a tough life but finds himself softening and becoming a surrogate father to the three children as Margaret does her best at being mother to the children. As time goes by, the little family become closer and Margaret finds herself falling for the man who is her polar opposite.<br /><br />This was a fun book to read. As always filled with Jill Barnett's trademark humour, witty dialogue and funny situations. The love story was not rushed but built over the entire length of the book. The children also added a lot of humour to the book as well as tenderness. Throw in a genie from a bottle called Muddy and you have a thumping great read. Highly recommended as with all Jill Barnett's books.<br /><br />Lea Ling Tsang	2004-07-29

During her voyage to the East she manages to escape the ship she is sailing on and is washed up onto the shore of Cornwall. She is saved by the handsome Pierce Kirrier, Lord Penhallow, who is immediately smitten by the green eyed beauty.<br /><br />  Pierce shuns the life of the ton in London and is happy to stay in Cornwall running his mining business and breeding horses. His mother and the villagers all think that he should marry soon so that he can produce an heir. The villagers think that their prayers have been answered when Eden turns up at Penhallow. Pierce and Eden immediately fall in love with one another but will Eden's past catch up with her and ruin their chance at happiness.<br /><br />This is an average run of the mill regency romance. The plot had potential but didn't go anywhere. I didn't warm to Eden as I thought that she should have told the truth before marrying Pierce. I also thought that her behaviour was childish when she ran off just because Pierce went away on a business trip. Pierce was a gallant gentleman but a bit shallow as he only seemed to love Eden because of her exceptional beauty.<br /><br />  Lea Ling Tsang	2004-07-27

Finally she decides to face her ghosts of yesteryear and returns to the town where she was brought up. There she bumps into Gary, her dead mother's ex-lover, whom she blames for the death of her mother 17 years ago.<br /><br />Gary is not the only ghost of her past she encounters. A mysterious stranger starts to haunt her dreams, a ghost from her past life. Not only does he haunt her in her dreams but he makes himself seen during her waking hours. This ghost is David Ventris, Lord Ashthorpe who lived and died about 200 years ago. David has been living in a sort of pergatory for the last two centuries and has now come forward to the present to seek redemption for a mistake he made in the past. As Jesse tries to find out the clues as to the death of her mother, she finds herself attracted to David and can't help but fall in love with him.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Susan Krinard's work but I really had difficulty ploughing through this book. Even with a little imagination, I could not believe in the ghostly tale. There was no chemistry between the two main characters and I could not see how they could fall in love or even care for each other. The tale was a little disjointed, jumping from the past and then into the present. Mixing the past lives with the present lives.<br /><br />Skip this one and read the Forest Lord or one of the werewolf stories such as Prince of Wolves or Touch of the Wolf also by Susan Krinard.<br /><br />Lea Ling Tsang	2004-07-19

Addie is more than happy to leave behind the dirty grimy city of Chicago and its poverty filled streets and armed with books on farming she heads out West to her new future. Upon her arrival at her lawyers office in the town of Bleeding Heart, she finds out that another person has a claim to the farm. This other person being in the form of tall, handsome and rugged but rather lacking in manners, Montana Creed. The dispute is decided by a judge who decrees that the land belongs to Montana but the buildings belong to Addie ie the water belongs to Montana but the pumps would belong to Addie.<br />Both Addie and Montana move onto the farm, she into the house and he camping outside in the grounds, figuring that possession is 9 points of the law. Both decide that they want to keep the farm and concocts up ideas to annoy and drive away the other. Addie refuses Montana use of her water pumps to water his horse, Jericho. Montana points a gun at her, until she calls his bluff. He then goes onto to frighten her by letting his horse into her bedroom, knowing that she has a fear for horses. Failing to drive her away, he tries to intimidate her through his amourous intentions, only for her to fall into his arms and in love with him as he tries his best not to do the same whilst she feeds him with awful food such as biscuits made part from plaster of paris! After all a way to a man's heart is through his stomach!<br />Oh, this was a wonderful book, full of so much humour, witty dialogue and funny situations. It was so much fun to watch Montana and Addie wind each other up and then falling deeply in love. The book starts on a serious note and ends in the same fashion but the middle is mainly full of Jill Barnett's trademark humour.

For her grandfather, Homer,  believes that Peregrine betrayed his friend and partner Liam O Shea by abandoning him in the jungle. Homer believes that their family have been cursed by Liam and that the only way to break the curse was to return the pendant to the jungle.<br />After Homer passes away, Mac keeps her promise and travels to Tikal, the Mayan ruins in Guatemala. She finds herself walking into a tunnel deep in the jungles and comes across a set of bones with a similar pendant hanging around its neck. She takes the two pendants and suddenly feels unwell, feeling queasy and the ground beneath her feet disappearing. The next thing she knows when walking out of the tunnel she bumps into man who looks very much like the man Liam O Shea, who she has seen an old photo. In fact, she later finds out that it is indeed the man himself she has been transported back in time to 1884. Mac finds herself attracted to the handsome but very macho Liam. And Liam despite finding Mac a little strange can't help finding himself being attracted to her in return.<br />The second half of the book is set in 1884 San Fransisco where Mac must prevent Liam from marrying his ward who happens to be her great great grandmother Caroline Gresham whom she must ensure marry her great great grandfather Peregrine Sinclair.<br />The first half of this book was great. The setting was adventurous and exotic. I had a fun time reading Mac and Liam's reaction to what they perceived to be strange behaviour in the other. Their mutual attraction was very engaging and it was nice to read that Mac wasn't your typical beauty but that Liam was still attracted to her all the same. I found the second half of the book a bit boring and couldn't wait for Mac and Liam to get back to the Guatemalan jungle.  I really didn't care much for the characters in the second half of the book.  I would have given the book 5 stars if the action had continued as in the first half of the book.

At 14 a tutor, Taylor Driscoll was brought in by her father to educate her and to tame her. Now at 22, Taylor has become her fiance and he rules her World with an iron rod. He sets her schedule for each day and she must adhere to the schedule which even includes how many minutes she can spend in the bathroom, what she must eat and what she must wear. She knows no different other than her orderly life and until the arrival of Dr Hank Montgmoery, an economics professor and union organizer.<br />Hank Montgmomery has been requested by the government to surveille the conditons of the workers of Caulden Ranch. Prior to the hop picking season, Hank is invited by Amanda's father to stay on their ranch and Amanda is allocated the task to keep him entertained by going to museums and lectures. Hank is not the stuffy professor that Amanda expected but a handsome young man that likes fast cars, women and the good life but he is also concerned about the welfare of the poor workers who have a tough life. Slowly Hank awakens Amanda to a life of other than books and lectures. He takes her dancing, to restaurants, moonlight trysts and the movie theatre. Later he also opens her eyes up to the plight of the poor migrant workers. They both fall for each other but can Hank persuade Amanda away from her safe orderly life in the arms of her cold tutor and fiance, Taylor?<br />This was such a wonderful book. Hank was so charming and such a gentleman, as with many of Jude Deveraux's heros. It was funny to read Amanda keeping to her strict schedule and then breaking free from it. The love story was beautiful as you could see both protagonists trying hard not to fall for each other but they cannot prevent the inevitable. A thoroughly good read indeed.

However, before the marriage can be consummated and an heir produced Lord Godwine suddenly dies. Rowena is more than happy that she does not have to lie with the old man but her step brother comes up with an idea that they kidnap a man with the same colourings as Lord Godwine and that Rowena lies with the man until she conceives, whilst they deceive the world of Lord Godwine's death.<br />Enter one handsome blond and muscular Warrick de Chaville, Lord Faulkhurst who is kidnapped by Gilbert's men thinking that he is a lowly serf. He is sent back to Gilbert's castle and chained to a bed. Rowena must now seduce him and lie with him until she conceives a child. If she does not do as she is told Gilbert will kill her mother. So Rowena sets out to seduce the handsome Lord who is at all times chained to the bed. In fact she she literally rapes him for three nights in a row until she she finds an opportunity to set him free on the third night. Warrick has never been so humiliated in his life and tries to resist Rowena's charms but his body betrays him.<br />On his release Warrick returns to capture Rowena and now the tables are turned. He treats her like for like and ties her to his bed and seduces her until her body betrays her and she gives in to his sensous touches.<br />However, as the days passes, Warrick finds himself being attracted to the wench and can no longer find it in himself to do her harm. Rowena learns of Warrick's hurtful past and also finds herself being attracted to the arrogant but handsome Lord. Will they find it in each other to forgive the other for their unforgiveable deeds?<br />Be warned this book is not written to be politically correct as the hero and the heroine both rape each other. However, the \\"rape\\" scenes are written in such a way that they can hardly be considered rape scenes as both parties seem to enjoy being seduced by the other. I myself found the scenes quite sexy but this is purely fantasy and in a real life situation I would be completely appalled.

She does everything in her power to tempt Draven but Draven will not touch her because because he is haunted by his past and also he knows that the King will order his death if he does not return Emily intact after the year has ended.<br />This was a smouldering love story. You could really feel Draven's passion reaching boiling point but he continues to resist the charms of Lady Emily. Draven was such a gentleman and it was fun to watch Emily chase after him.

Further meetings take place in Bath and after clearing up their misunderstanding Freyja agrees to pose as Joshua's fiancee to thwart plans by his aunt to get Joshua to married to his cousin. As time goes by their betrothal becomes more and more real as do their feelings for each other.<br />This book was a wonderful regency romp. The hero is a mischievous rogue with a heart of gold and the heroine is a headstrong lady with a punch that packs. Freyja is not a typical beauty but Joshua sees her as his beautiful untamed lady anyway. It was great to see the two antagonists fall in love with each other and realise that their betrothal is more than a fake one.

Kyrian of Thrace traded his soul two thousand years ago and has been a Dark Hunter since, an immortal who rids this world of the dangers of the vampire like Daimons who feed on the soul of humans. One day in New Orleans he wakes up to find himself handcuffed to Amanda Deveraux, an accountant who leads a normal boring life and likes it that way. They have been captured by Desiderius, a powerful Daimon who can only be killed by a Dark Hunter with a soul. The only problem is no Dark Hunter has a soul. A dark hunter has to win back his soul. Kyrian and Amanda managed to escape and they must hunt down Desiderius before they become the ones who are hunted down.<br />Kyrian of Thrace was gorgeous (as with all of Ms Kenyon's heros) and you can just imagine all those rippling muscles, 6 pack abs jumping off the page. Amanda was a tough heroine and stuck by her man even though she wasn't sure there was any future for them together. The sex scenes are hot. Your fingers will get burnt turning the pages. I also like the introduction of other Dark Hunters such as Acheron and Talon (who is featured in the following book Night Embrace). Ms Kenyon's writing is full of humour and modern slang which adds a certain pizzazz to the book which is unique.

Cyn has been convalescing for the past few months and is looking for adventure. He immediately recognises Chastity as all female and goes along for the ride and promises to help Chastity and her sister.<br />This was a fun regency romance to read but not exceptional. I felt that the father of Chasisty was rather cruel in his treatment of Chastity and didn't like this aspect of the story at all.

She is promised to her neighbour and childhood friend, the very proper Harrison Tate but finds herself being drawn to the courageous and heroic Lucas Gallagher. The attraction is mutual but they both know that any union between the two could be dangerous for Lucas and that there could be no future for a convict and a lady.<br />This was a beautiful doomed love story that tugs at the heartstrings. It's not a frivolous historical romance as with many of the genre but there is a hard edge to the story when you learn about a convict's life in a harsh environment. There is mention of rape and even child abuse in this novel, which may be sound shocking but realistic to the situation. I personally do not like my escapism romance novels to tackle unpleasant issues such as child abuse or rape but I suppose the author must have included the chapters to make this a truly realistic portrayal of life in 1840s Australia. A very serious read of a poignant love story, set in a very believable historical period and surroundings.<br />Lealing	2004-06-06

Lucy and Gerard find themselves drawn to each other. Gerard opens up Lucy's heart where Lucy has been at pains to hide her emotions after an upbringing without love from her father. Together Gerard and Lucy finds love and salvation within each other.<br />This was an action packed love story. The feelings of the two main leads are slowly built up over the entire length of the book and is totally believable. It's not a story where the hero and heroine fall in love immediately. Gerard and Lucy grow to love each other and accept each other's faults. The adventure on the high seas is rivetting and will keep you on the edge of your seats.

I did however, find it annoying that Emily did not choose to tell Jordan why she was being blackmailed and kept the secret to herself, but then again the book would have come to a speedy end if she had done so. This is my first book by the author and I will no doubt check out her other books.<br />Lealing	2004-05-25

Hern has made an agreement with the local human inhabitants of Hartsmere that their village be blessed with prosperity as long as they leave his forest untouched. All is well until Cyrus trespasses on the forest during a hunt. He is caught by Hern and is threatened with death unless he is willing to give his daughter's hand in marriage to Hern. Hern requires an heir before he can return to the World of the Fane. The deal is struck and Hern disguises himself as the handsome but mysterious Cornelius Fleming, a distant cousin. Cornelius and Cyrus' daughter, Eden elope and discover a night of passion. Eden's happiness is shattered when she discovers Cornelius is not human but a monster. She runs away from Cornelius before he discovers that she is pregnant with their child.<br />Six years later, after losing her child and being married to a husband she does not love, Eden returns Hartsmere, where she discovers her lost child, Donal. Hern, after losing Eden and the child has been lying dormant in the enchanted forest sleeping for six years. He returns to Hartsmere, this time disguised as a manservant named Hartley to get his revenge on Eden.<br />This is a highly original book and my favourite by Susan Krinard. There are so many twists and turns in the plot to keep you turning the pages. The description of nature and the forests is magical and you can really believe in the World of Fane created by Susan Krinard. Hern/Cornelius/Hartley is absolutely gorgeous (even with his horns) and although he can feel no emotions you are really touched by his interaction with his son, Donal. He searches for love in Eden although his Fane heart will not allow it. This is a tender, as opposed to lusty, love story and is a must read for all romance readers whether into the paranormal twist or not. A very highly recommended read.<br />Lealing	2004-05-09

Will Madelaine resist the charms of Gabriel and will they trust each other enough to stop the scam that is the Game of the Century?<br />This is my second book by Christina Dodd and will probably be my last. I had trouble finishing the book and alsmost gave up half way through. The danger lurking in the background didn't really get off to a start and you could predict the ending. There was no chemistry between Gabriel and Madelaine except for one sex scene which was quite hot. Apart from this scene give the book a miss and read a book by other historical romantic authors who do a much better job.<br />Lealing	2004-05-09

Arianna was born an immortal high witch in a small village called Stonehaven in Scotland. She frequents the local witches called the Crones to learn all about their magic. Little does she know that her powers exceed way beyond those of her teachers. When the Crones are murdered by the villagers for being witches, Nicodimus steps in to save Arianna from the same fate by marrying for he is a close friend of the cheiftains of the village. Nicodimus is also an immortal high witch but is discreet about his powers. He is many centuries older than Arianna but remains at the physical age of 28, the age that he first experienced death before reliving again. Nicodimus has given his name to Arianna for her protection but not his heart for he has been hurt in the past from the death of his first wife and three children. Slowly but reluctantly he teaches Arianna what she is and what powers they hold.  In the background lies danger in the form of Nicodimus' ex brother in laws who blame him for the death of their sister. Before Arianna can truly learn about her status, Nicodimus is taken away from her and they do meet again until over four hundred years later in 1999.<br />This is the sequel to Maggie Shayne's Eternity which features Raven and Duncan's story. In a way the first half of the book is a prequel to Eternity whereby the second half is the sequel. I would recommend that you read Eternity first otherwise you will feel cheated half way through the book when it jumps four centuries ahead with only a page and a half to explain what happened between the centuries.<br />This is a captivating little saga with danger lurking closely at every corner. You feel for Arianna as you wonder whether Nicodimus is ever going to return the love that she feels for him right from the start. The time period is well described so you can feel that you are living in 1511 in Scotland. Arianna makes for a strong heroine and Nicodimus a genuine and caring hero. The villains are truly villainous and you find yourself rooting for Arianna and Nicodimus to defeat them. A thoroughly good read and highly recommended.<br />Lealingus a genuine and caring hero.

He doesn't believe that she is a lady because she was dusguised in a maid's clothing. Once in Russia, Katherine tries to plan her escape without much success.<br />I must say the sex scenes were hot although it is slightly scandalous that Katherine was in effect drugged and raped in her first meeting with Dimitri. However, if you can put aside the raping incident, the book is really quite a good read and the interaction between the two main leads is fun.

In the shadow there is danger in their lives in the form of a madman.<br />The premise sounded really good.

She tries to do her best to revive him, with her surgeon skills and finds herself wildly attracted to him but cannot accept such a strong feeling that she is Jacques lifemate. Jacques and Shea can communicate through their minds and Shea does not know whether she likes Jacques invading her every moment but she feels that she cannot feel when she is cut off from him. Lurking in the background are evil forces, a vampire ie a carpathian who has turned to the dark side, is hunting them and wishes to destroy them.

It was very dark and intense. However, I did find there was a lot of repetitiveness when Jacque repeats over and over again about being lifemates with Shea.

I sat up until 3.30am, crying my eyes out towards the end. This is my first book by Kathleen Kane and I am so glad that I bought it after reading another Amazon reviewer's comments.  The hero is not perfect, in fact, he is riddled with faults but that's what makes him so endearing. The heroine is no fragile flower but will follow blindly where her heart leads her. A story of doomed love, told with much humor and tenderness. You will not be disappointed!<br />Lealing	2003-06-03

Lady Regina Ashton, known by her family as Reggie, is brought up by her four uncles, Edward, Jason, James and Anthony Malory. This is her second season of attending balls and functions with the aim of finding a husband. Easy it might seem for such an exquisite beauty but not so with her four scrutinizing uncles to please.<br />On her way to a masked ball, she is kidnapped by one Nicholas Eden, Viscount of Montieth and notorious rake with mysterious and shameful past. She is held captive in his bedchamber for a certain number of hours and upon her release vows to marry the handsome rogue who has ruined her reputation. Thus commences the wooing of the Viscount of Montieth.<br />This is the first part of Johanna Lindsey's much loved Malory series. I found this book to be a run of the mill regency romance and was rather disappointed that it did not live up to other JL books that I had previously read. However, it is a good introduction to the Malory family, whom you will no doubt meet again in the sequels. An enjoyable and easy read although not the best in the series.<br />Look out for Anthony's story in Tender Rebel, the next in the series.<br />Lealing	2003-05-28

Milisant and Wulfric have only met once previously when she was 6 years old and he 13 years old, an unpleasant meeting that neither of them could forget. Given one month to get to know each other before the wedding, sparks fly when Milisant and Wulf are thrown together but there is a hidden danger lying in wait for Milisant.<br />A sweet story. However, I didn't find the relationship between Wulfric and Milisant very convincing. Milisant is so unpleasant to Wulfric I can't see what made him fall in love with her. Still it's a good read.

Whilst waiting for an underground train to arrive at Hyde Park Corner tube station, Anne watches as a man, in a heavy overcoat, steps back from the platform, with a look of panic on his face and falls onto the tracks. She turns to leave the station and picks up a scrap of paper, dropped by the doctor who examined the dead man. It reads 1 7.122 Kilmorden Castle. The following day the Daily Budget headline reads Extraordinary Sequel to Tube Accident, Woman Found Stabbed in Lonely House. Anne who has always yearned for adventure and romance decides to investigate the two incidents, which leads her half way around the world to Cape Town in South Africa.<br />Miss Christies love of travel is often reflected in her novels and in this case the reader is taken on an adventure through the wild scenery and rough landscape of South Africa and Rhodesia (now known as Zimbabwe). There are as many twists and turns in the novel as there are introductions of new characters. Anne makes a superb heroine, a rather ordinary girl who gets to live the life of adventure for a change. The fine, upstanding and gallant Colonel Race makes an appearance for the first time in an Agatha Christie mystery. The plot is intricately spun and the suspense as thick as the darkness of a moonless night. A pleasant surprise is the element of romance, which is rare in an Agatha Christie mystery. A classic, which I would rate as highly as the better known novels such Death on the Nile or Murder on the Orient Express.<br />Lealing	2003-05-28

As with the previous book, I found this book to be a run of the mill regency romp. I did find that Rosalynn spent too much time of the novel being jealous and angry at Anthony but then where would the fun be without the antagonism?

Alec Castlemaine is the no-nonsense, proud Duke of Belmore, epitome of the English aristocracy. Jilted by his carefully selected fianc&eacute;e, he marries the next woman who drops into his lap. Joyous Fiona MacQuarrie, a descendant of a powerful clan of witches, finds herself a hundred miles from her intended destination and in the arms of the handsome Duke. After a whirlwind romance consisting of no more than a few stolen kisses, Joy finds herself married to the Duke. Alec has grown up with a strict upbringing and no love, so does not believe in love himself. He has taken a wife to salvage his wounded pride of being rejected by another woman. Joy could not have dreamed of a more perfect fairytale romance but what will her new husband do when she confesses that she is a witch and not a very talented one at that. And what will she feel when she discovers the truth about their fairytale romance?<br />Miss Barnett truly knows how to weave a magical story filled with humour and romance. Joy is an endearing heroine who never fails to be amazed by the life that surrounds her. \\"I see a silver lake that reflects the color of the sky and shines like polished serving plates\\" is her description of the Serpentine Lake during a sleigh ride across Hyde Park. Her less than admirable witchcraft skills gets her into trouble often enough, giving rise to occasions for the reader to laugh out loud, as does her naivety. Alec is one of those heroes with a tortured soul and who needs a good woman to fill his heart with love and trust. Always the ultimate challenge for the heroine of a romance novel. If you like your romance novels with sensual love scenes you will not be disappointed by Miss Barnett. The ending will leave a warm glow in your heart and pink rose petals fluttering around.<br />Lealing	2003-05-28

He races off after her, only to lose her but walks straight into a trap. Teleri, an orphan brought up in the woods, shunned by the villagers because they believe her to be a witch stumbles upon the half dead knight lying in the woods. She saves the reluctant knight and falls in love with him. But will Roger let go of his past and learn to love Teleri in return? &quot;I leaned my back against an oak thinking it was a trusty tree. But first it bent, and then it broke and let me down as my love did me.&quot;<br />Truly a beautiful love story interwoven into its natural surrounding. Roger is the typical handsome knight in shining armour but the heroine, Teleri is a real gem. She is so kind and innocent but at the same time not weak. She's attracted by all wounded souls, be they animals or wounded knights. It was funny imagining this slip of a girl taming her angry knight and heartening to watch him softening under her gentle influence. The &quot;loving&quot; scenes were hot, sensual and daring, maybe too daring for that era but who's complaining!<br />Lealing	2003-05-28

Angela Sherrington is the daughter of a poor farmer in Alabama who has had a crush on Bradford Maitland since she was eleven, when he rode past her on his black stallion and splashed her with mud. He tossed her a coin, for the ruined dress and she keeps this coin hung around her neck as a reminder. Some 9 or 10 years later she spots Bradford about to walk into a building in Masachusettes and follows him, not knowing that she has just walked into a bordelo.<br />I really liked the first half of the book but knew I would be disappointed with the second half after Angela runs away.

I read the Conquest first and really enjoyed it so I decided that I had to read the prequel, the Taming. From the comments I have read by other people it was just what I expected. The hero is a real pig and really needed domesticating as well as taming! He's not my type of hero at all. How could he rape his bride (to avoid an annulment of the marriage) and then spend his honeymoon nights with other women, leaving his new bride alone. I really couldn't see why Liana was attracted to him. As for discovering that Rogan already had millions of offspring (from his \\"Days\\") running around the village, I found that a right turn off. I preferred the Conquest but feel that the Peregrines are filled with too much hatred.	2003-02-21

I wasn't hooked immediately but was soon after Pi boarded his Noah's Ark. I felt like I was riding a wave of emotions as I accompanied Pi through his long struggle to survive. I felt his fear for Richard Parker and his triumph when the whistle he blew conquered Richard Parker. I could feel his joy and his misery of the downpours of rain and the scorching of the midday sun. The book is a wealth of discovery. How do you fish in the middle of the ocean? How do you know how to eat a turtle? How do you catch the rain? Not a book for the fainthearted though nor for vegetarians. The description of death of the zebra was not a pretty sight. And as for Pi salivating for the taste of Richard Parker's excrement, I must admit I was fascinated to find out Pi's degustation. A very original book which I would highly recommend!	2003-02-11

I bought this book 2 evenings ago in an English bookstore in Paris (whilst looking for Johanna Lindsey books)and finished it last night, in between having to go to work and a few hours sleep. This is my first Jude Devereux book and I really enjoyed it. I have been on the look out for time travel/regression romance novels ever since reading Barbara Erskine's Lady of Hay as a teenagaer. I enjoyed Knight in Shining Armour but it's not the best I have read in this genre. Both lead characters are likeable. Nicholas is absolutely gorgeous but Dougless is weak (or stupid?) Do real women actually let men walk all over them like Dougless allows her past lovers to?  The author's references to Elizabethan details are interesting to discover and Nicholas' discovery of the modern world is amusing. The friendship and relationship which evolves between the 2 lead characters keeps you involved in the book and you can truly believe that there is a great love between them. My only complaint is that there could have been a stronger love, a love throughout an eternity but this is not achieved because Dougless remains the same person in physical body, mind and sole whilst Nicholas changes.	2003-01-24
