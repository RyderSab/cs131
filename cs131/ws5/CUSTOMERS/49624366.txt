The wonderful thing about &quot;Hidden Passions&quot; is that you do not need to be a fan of Passions to read it. The book actually introduces you to the main characters in Passions and it reveals all of their secrets!<br />My favorite parts of the book are Timmy's footnotes and &quot;Tabitha's Diaries&quot;. In &quot;Tabitha's Diaries&quot;, the readers discover the reason why Tabitha, the witch, hates everyone in Harmony (specifically the Cranes and the Standishes)!	2001-03-23

I have been reading Sidney Sheldon's books since high school and they are all very captivating. However, &quot;If Tomorrow Comes&quot; is a definite standout.

They seemed to have a very happy marriage on the outside. However, on the inside, it was a very bad marriage. Jack constantly belittled Maddy and he often made her feel worthless. He called her names.<br />Anyway, I was very entertained during the first week and a half of reading this book. During the last week, however, I got really impatient with Maddy. It took her quite a while to leave Jack!	2000-12-04

When I picked up this book for the first time, I was a little unsure about reading Sidney Sheldon's books. I was unsure because my only favorite author at that time was V.C. Andrews and I had never read any of his books. However, when I started to read this book, I realized that his style is nothing like Andrews. He has much more tension and backstabbing in his book.<br />Anyway, I read this book when I was in high school and I still think about it today. I was not very happy when Larry decided to cheat on his wife with Noelle.	2000-11-16
