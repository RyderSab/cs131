Options on a per season basis are presented too.<br />* The color combinations of the outfits are also great. While the book shows outfits in timeless neutral-and-color combinations, there are also color-color combinations that do not overwhelm.<br />* The book also shows outfits in interesting mixes of textures as well as prints.<br />* The sections on packing for a three-day trip, streamlining your wardrobe, and rules of shopping are good bonuses too.<br />The following are the reasons why my rating is one star away from the perfect rating:<br />* I've been a fan of their magazine for years now, and I must say that I've already seen some of the featured clothes in the book in previous issues of the magazines<br />* The pieces of advice on fit are ok, but Christa Weil's Secondhand Chic gives a more comprehensive advice on this topic. Both visual and feel cues are discussed in detail in that book. Secondhand Chic also offers advice on how to make the most out of one's figure which would complement those of Lucky Shopping Manual's.<br />* They could also do a separate section on shirts next time instead of integrating it in the Tops section.<br />* Perhaps they could also feature sections on watches and jewelry.	2004-06-18

This is not your usual coffee table book on interior decoration. High on content and low on flashy (and usually inapplicable to real-life decorating) photos, it is the kind of reading material that you can grab when you need to get quick and useful ideas on elements of interior design such as space, lighting, furniture arrangement, and the like.  The author's witty and straightforward writing style makes it a pleasure to read. Finally, the book does not impose its style on you - rather, it uncovers basic principles behind the various elements of interior decoration for you to actually apply depending on your needs, budget, and style.	2002-05-10

The self-assessment portion helps figure out how to align your spine and posture, and the warm up exercises really serve to limber up your body in preparation for the workout.  In fact, if performed accurately and correctly, the warm up exercises can constitute a workout in themselves.  The book comes with full-color photographs.  For each particular step, photos are shown.  Arrows help the reader figure out which direction to move their limbs.  Alternative exercises for those with injuries are also included.  For those who wish to do Pilates in a Pilates gym/studio, a chapter is also devoted on a typical exercises that one can do using Pilates equipment.	2002-02-12

This is my fourth Pilates book and I must say that this is the real fundamental resource for the Pilates method.<br />One major difference that you'll find in this book is that it asks you to prepare and condition your body first before you execute the actual classic Pilates exercises. The book first discusses the ideal posture and proper body alignment that we are born with, its importance in our everyday life, and the reasons why this ideal gets distorted as we grow older.  You can also means of assessing your current posture and body alignment here. According to this book, there are generally three types of postural deformities that can be addressed by doing Pilates exercises.  For each of the deformities, corresponding corrective exercises are enumerated and described.  (This is akin to Anna Selby's Pilates book in that regard - that is an equally good book although not as expansive as this one is.)<br />Traditional methods would ask you to do \\"The Hundred\\" as a means of warming up the body.  Before even touching on \\"The Hundred\\", though, this book first asks you, and tells you how to: make sure that you correctly locate your powerhouse, ensure that your spine is in neutral, that your pelvic is steady, that you are breathing correctly, and all the other fundamental exercises that you should know to fine-tune your body.  I thought I was doing Pilates correctly, but after reading this book, I realized that so much more can be done in attaining optimal results using Pilates, principally by preparing your body for the exercises to come.<br />Very often, in doing Pilates exercises, one is asked to put one's \\"navel to spine\\".  This book clarifies exactly what that means, and gives guidance on how to execute this move properly.  In addition, Pilates exercises call for lifting or rolling down \\"vertebra by vertebra\\".  This book also tells you exactly what that means, and points to the body parts that correspond to these areas. Another thing that I like about this book isthat it provides visualization tips to execute each move correctly all throughout the workouts.<br />Lest you think that this book is all about preparatory exercises for Pilates, let me say too the classic Pilates exercises are also included in this book - with new and helpful tips to execute the moves properly.  The instructions are presented clearly and not without good humor at times.<br />This full color, photograph-filled book is segregated into different sections.  You have the sections for the beginner, for the intermediate, and for the advanced exercises.  You also have sections for selecting which type of workout you should do (exercises included) depending on your lifestyle.  Say you are a dancer, actor, sedentary worker, or athlete - flip through these sections and find the workout suitable for you.  Say you have a specific body problem - for example, you are knock-kneed, or you have tight ankles, there are also exercises here that can help you.<br />My only comment about this book is that it assumes that one has mastered the human anatomy.  Through the course of the exercises and discussions, references to specific muscle groups are made, most with illustrations and layperson's terms, but a few without.  I readily forgive this flaw, though, for I do find myself benefiting greatly from the contents of this book.	2001-07-13

Read and try the beauty tips and recipes that can be found in this book. (Always do a skin patch test first, though to save yourself the trouble of skin irritation later on.)  You can see a collection of beauty tips that range from the simple and expected to the downright unbelievable (the kitty litter facial mask, for example).  As for me, I found that breaking up a caplet or two of Vit. E and squeezing its contents in my shampoo makes my hair healthier.  The recipes with honey in it are also beneficial for me.  And I found out that massaging coffee grounds on my body skin is indeed a surprisingly inexpensive way to make it suppler.  An entire section is also devoted to simple and healthy meals that you can whip up fast, for you, or for your guests to feast on.	2001-07-09

The topics covered are wide in scope and are really after enabling the development of effective customer focus.<br />Written in a refreshingly easy and readable format, the book begins with an introduction to the concept of customer care,  and the changing nature of customer service.  The book then goes on to discuss management's role in developing strategy geared towards effective customer service.  What follows is a chapter devoted to developing tools geared towards generating and monitoring customer feedback and satisfaction - my favorite chapter, as this area is the usual point of slack in assessing an organization's quality of service.  Pieces of advice are given in various areas including (but not limited to):  appropriateness research methods to be used, questionnaire development, involvement of top management in the monitoring of action points taken from customers' feedback.<br />Empowerment, training and development, communications, and implementation of a customer-care strategy - concepts that are all indispensable to the customer care practitioner - are also covered in detail in this book.  Real-life examples of concept applications are also incorporated so that the reader does not feel inundated with theories alone.  Each section ends with a checklist of practical and applicable activities that can be used in evaluating the service that your company currently provides, and in assessing areas for possible improvement.	2001-07-09

(I found this the hard way when I tried the petroleum jelly hair conditioning - I found that the portion called for is too much for my hair.  However, the conditioning treatment turned out fine when I reduced the portion significantly.)  In addition to this, some of the recipes call for ingredients which I have difficulty looking for.<br />What I like about this book are the relaxation tips that are included in addition to beauty recipes - I especially liked the bit that teaches you to de-stress yourself by simple hand strokes and visualization.  And in presenting beauty recipes and rituals of women across the world, I appreciated knowing more about women worldwide, and how much and how little my culture and theirs have in common.	2001-07-09

It features the different basic stitches (in UK terms) and explains how to do each of them. This book contains a number of projects which are a delight to make.  Some of the projects are quite a challenge but somehow the instructions make it easier.  I particularly like the textured cushion, table setting, and chart patterns featuring two people and a tree.

I own another Pilates book and have exercised using that,  but Siler's The Pilates Body tops that in many ways.<br />First, Siler was  able to provide inputs and tips that are vital to the understanding AND  proper execution of each matwork.  In addition, the author also carefully  explains to the user the fundamentals of Pilates exercise; a very important  factor in achieving the right results and avoiding injury.<br />Second, she  taps into one's visual imagination to help carry out the exercises  effectively.  Sketches of these visual images are likewise included.<br />Third, before launching into the matwork proper, there is actually a  portion on exercises for beginners.  This is good because Pilates is not  exactly the easiest kind of exercise to get into, especially after one has  been accustomed to aerobic and weight-lifting exercises.<br />Finally I like  the fact that the book communicates its rich contents in a clear, direct,  (no unnecessary ramblings, and I liked that!) and encouraging manner.	2000-08-10

And finally I wonder why the exercises were not arranged from easy to  difficult, so that the beginner and expert for that matter, can see which  steps one should do.  <br />With all these, one may expect me to give a rating  not higher than 2, but since the book helped achieve my goal (a flat tummy  and slimmer limbs and behind) I'm giving this a 3, missing steps or no  missing steps.   To be on the safe side, if you're a beginner in Pilates,  better find another book.  This one's for those with some Pilates  experience already.	2000-07-24

Packed with helpful information for the avid shopper from cover to cover, this book goes the extra mile by giving pointers not just on finding great buys in consignment, thrift, vintage, and resale shops, but for quality  shopping in general.<br />Beginning with the advantages and disadvantages of  buying secondhand items, the author walks the reader in a delightfully  personal way through finding clothes that are flawlessly constructed and  give perfect fit regardless of name tags.  (There is a section which  discusses famous name tags in fashion, too, by the way.)  Guidelines on how  to spot quality accessories are likewise given.  The book successfully  guides the reader in finding his/her personal style,  gauging one's figure  and the possible remedies for these,  looking for the right fabric, color,  and fit, and garment features that indicate excellent quality (the author  calls this \\"quality hallmarks\\").  This book also outlines what flaws are  considered  \\"not-so-bad\\", \\"bad\\", and \\"very very ugly\\". There is also a  whole chapter  which is devoted solely to maintenance and organization,  which is a big help especially for those who find themselves clueless in  terms of clothes care, and for those who have major closet space problems.  You also have a section which helps you sell what you own at secondhand  stores.  All these, and more!  For the ardent shopper, you will find that  the wealth of information in this book is invaluable, and may all be that  you'll ever need for your every shopping spree.  Two thumbs-up!	2000-07-24

I don't know why  some people are so skeptical about \\"The Rules\\", but they work for me unlike  any other.  I admire the men who are honest enough to say that \\"The Rules\\"  do indeed work.  \\"The Code&quot; by Penn and Larose, a rejoinder to \\"The  Rules\\",  may just be proof that some of the male populace are somehow edgy  that their secrets are now in the open.<br />When Fein and  Schneider said  that \\"The Rules\\" work on all men regardless of race, age, etc., they  weren't kidding.  I'm not American (as the authors are) and yet, \\"The  Rules\\" worked on the men in my country. Don't feel bad and think that  you're being cruel to malehood; thrive on the fact that you're giving them  the thrills that they want from hurdling over the challenge that is YOU.  Don't take offense and think that a woman still has to play it coy at this  day and age.  Men love --- no, they thrive on --- challenge.  Don't take  that away from him and then wonder why you're not having the relationship  you deserve.<br />Now you only have to stick to \\"The Rules\\", and follow  them very religiously.	2000-07-18

Complete instructions and full illustration  using International symbols are also provided per stitch.  The patterns  featured at the end of each section show good usage of stitches discussed.  Font used is of a good, eye-friendly type and size.  The book size in  itself also makes for a handy reference tool.<br />Not-so-good points:  First, there are quite a number of almost-similar stitches with almost no  or very little distinction.
