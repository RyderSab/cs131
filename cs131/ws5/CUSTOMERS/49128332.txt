For fans of wrestling or biographies Lawler's got a lot of stories to share and does not disappoint.<br />For longtime wrestling fans Lawler takes a sweeping view back across his life and gives you the lowdown on just about everything from his childhood, his multiple marriages, his family, his hobbies and interests and - of course, his life in wrestling.  Among the things he shares with the reader are:<br />1. His interest in art and how it kept him out of Vietnam<br />2. His time spent as a radio DJ<br />3. How he broke into the wrestling business with in the Tennessee territory<br />4. How he met each of his wives<br />5. His connection to \\"The King\\" Elvis Presley<br />6. TONS of road stories with guys like Jackie Fargo, Jerry Jarrett and Sam Bass<br />7. The REAL story of his infamous feud with Andy Kauffman and his later filming of \\"Man on the Moon\\"<br />8. A few stories about his time in the WWE<br />9. The Story Behind the firing of the \\"Kat\\" and his divorce from Stacy Carter<br />10. His running for Memphis Mayor<br />11. Some of his \\"Ring Rat\\" stories (oh boy...)<br />THE COOL STUFF<br />If you're a Lawler fan you'll definitely love the stories King has to share (he's got a lot of them).  The book reads very much like a sit down chat with a friend as Lawler doesn't hold much back.  For old school wrestling fans his stories of the old Memphis territory are the real gems in this book.  For WWE fans Lawler really doesn't share too much about his WWE experiences (he does cover his Bret feud and that's about it really) that most long-time WWE fans already know about.  A comic at heart Lawler does spice the book out with a bunch of his one-liners he'll use of commentary which was pretty funny.<br />THE VERDICT<br />If you love bios Lawler's a good one for you.  You come away from the book knowing the guy's poured his heart out to you (kudos to him for being able to open up his heart about all his failed marriages).  You get some nice stories about art, music, wrestling, life on the road, a bunch of good one liners and some pretty nasty tales about all the ladies he's met over the years.  Yup, this one's got it all.<br />Highly Recommended<br />Total Pages:  384<BR>Total Read Time:  About 9 hours over 6 nights	2004-06-20

Trump	If you've picked up \\"Trump:  How to Get Rich\\" in hopes of learning the secrets or the path to become wealthy you'll be very disappointed BUT the book is still an interesting read.  Here's the lowdown on the book.<br />WHAT IT IS NOT<br />Trump doesn't really tell you how to become rich.  There are no tips on landing the high paying job or making the killer investments.  So if you're looking for a manual to get rich you'll want to look elsewhere.  Realistically you'll probably want to get a good personal finance book or a entrepreneurial book.<br />WHAT THIS BOOK IS<br />This is actually more of Trump's memoirs where he tells you the tales of some of his big deals he's made and his manual for having a SUCCESSFUL CAREER and life.<br />Among the gems he shares with you are:<br />1. How to recruit and hire good talent to work for you.  (Hire people who WANT to do your work and are talented and loyal).<br />2. Get a job good.  (Do something you enjoy)<br />3. Get the pay raise you want.  (Ask the boss when he/she's in a good mood)<br />4. Make good investments.  (Invest only in what you are knowledgeable about)<br />5. Timing is everything when it comes to making deals.<br />6. You need to know what the other guy is thinking when making deals and meet their needs<br />A lot of it is common sense really but hearing it from someone like Trump reinforces it.<br />The book is broken down into 6 main sections:  <br />1. \\"The Donald J. Trump School of Business,\\" <br />2. \\"Your Personal Apprenticeship:  Career Advice from the Donald,\\" <br />3. \\"Money, Money, Money, Money,\\"  <br />4. \\"The Secrets of Negotiation\\"<br />5. \\"The Trump Lifestyle,\\"<br />6. \\"Inside the Apprentice.\\"<br />In the first 3 sections he basically talks about those little gems we mentioned.  In \\"The Secrets of Negotiation\\" he goes into the stories of how he made his biggest deals in real estate which is a fascinating read and is, to me, the best part of the book and where the true value in the book lies.  He also gives you some tips on public speaking which is pretty valuable.<br />In \\"The Trump Lifestyle\\" he basically gives you the \\"week in the life of\\" treatment where he details his schedule in a typical week.  Getting a peak into his life and how his business works is pretty fascinating to read and a bit inspiring but can also been seen somewhat as \\"fluff\\" for the book.  It's a real insight though.<br />\\"Inside the Apprentice\\" is exactly what it is.  He talks about how the show came about, how it was produced and gives you his opinion on the candidates.<br />Interspersed in the book The Donald also gives you his opinion on a lot of the various big wigs in business, politics, entertainment, etc.  Trump comes across as a pretty fair guy but he also has his moments where you can tell he's got a gripe with some people (as the chapter \\"Sometimes You Just Need To Screw Them\\" tells you).<br />At the very end of the book is a little Appendix detailing all of Trump's various properties and ventures.<br />THE ANALYSIS<br />Again, the book isn't exactly what you'd think it is from the cover BUT Trump's stories and the look behind the scenes at the Trump Organization are interesting and you can take away some knowledge of what it's like to run a successful company and live the successful lifestyle.  His tools for success again are pretty common sense you probably didn't need to pay to read that but if you look at the book as more of a memoir it's a real interesting read.  Fans of The Apprentice will appreciate a look behind the show and a look into life at The Trump Organization (Carolyn, George, Robin and Norma or in here too).<br />THE VERDICT<br />Well, the book somewhat fails as a \\"How To Get Rich\\" book, but it succeeds as a memoir into the life of one of America's richest men.<br />So, if you want to learn how to get rich put your money into a good personal finance book BUT if you want to read about how one of America's most successful businessmen operates this is a great book for that.<br />If you're interested in what he says to say on this stuff, cool, pass otherwise<br />Mildly Recommended	2004-05-27

The distinguishing trait I find that separates this bio from a lot of the other wrestler biographies of recent years is that it is the most \\"biographical\\" of the other bios, meaning that you not only get Hogan's wrestling career in review but also his real life story in review.<br />THE BOOK<br />The book will definitely appeal to wrestling fans as well as fans of Hulk Hogan.  Hogan tells a very comprehensive story of his career and his life, both in wrestling and in Hollywood.  Among the things you learn about are:<br />- His trauma's growing up as a fat kid<br />- His family background<br />- How he met his wife<br />- His lifelong love affair with wrestling (Dusty Rhodes was his idol)<br />- His careers as a musician, dock worker and gym/bar owner<br />- His time spent as a wrestling groupie<br />- His breaking into the business in Florida and throughout the South<br />- His friendship with Andre the Giant<br />- His time in the AWA<br />- Making Rocky III<br />- Leading the way for the WWF in the 80's including his status as the <BR>most requested Make A Wish celebrity<br />- The lowdown on Mr. T, John Stossel, Richard Belzer, Dennis Rodman and Jay Leno<br />- His feuds with Savage and the Warrior<br />- The steroid trials and his opinion on steroid use<br />- Making of No Holds Barred, Mr. Nanny, Suburban Commando, <BR>Thunder in Paradise and his other B Movies<br />- His boating accident with Ed Leslie<br />- Signing with WCW<br />- His problems with the New World Order<br />- The story of his problems with Vince Russo<br />- His knee problems <br />- His rebuttal to his critiques<br />- His return to the WWE<br />THE COOL STUFF<br />Overall, Hogan writes a very comprehensive story leaving almost no stone unturned.  Not only is this a great history of the wrestling business for the past 20 years or so but it's just a fascinating story to read.  Hogan comes across as a person who's justvery surprised at his own success.  It's pretty inspiring to see how a former fat kid who got teased growing up grew up into one of the most famous athletes in wrestling history and how someone of \\"limited wrestling ability\\" became the person who put wrestling on the pop culture map.  In all if you're a wrestling fan you'll love a lot of the road stories Hogan has to share including his tales of Andre the Giant and the time of WWF's expansion in the 80's.  You'll also love the stories of his work with the other celebrities like Mr. T, Dennis Rodman and Jay Leno as you'll find things weren't as chummy as they seemed on-screen.  For wrestling fans you get the benefit of seeing the industry through Hogan's eyes.  This is important because Hogan, for the better part of 15 years, was at the top of the industry and his a unique viewpoint of it.  His thoughts on the major promoters, wrestlers and angles are just fascinating to read if you're a wrestling fan. Overall, his is just fascinating story.<br />THE VERDICT<br />Love him or hate him, you can't deny Hogan's influence on wrestling and pop culture and you cannot say that he's had a boring life.  \\"Hollywood Hulk Hogan\\" is a fascinating memoir of one man's life in the entertainment industry and man does he have some stories to share.<br />Total Pages:  343<BR>Total Read Time:  8 hours over three nights<br />Highest Recommendation	2004-05-27
US	49128332	RBZTWGD3T7D6V	0743477200	482833151	The Stone Cold Truth (WWE)	Books	5	52	53	N	N	And That�s the Bottom Line�	\\"Stone Cold\\" Steve Austin's autobiography, \\"The Stone Cold Truth\\" details the life and career of one of the biggest icons in professional wrestling history.  Overall, it's a great look at the life and times of one of America's most popular entertainers.<br />THE BOOK<br />Like any autobiography, the book discusses Austin's childhood growing up in Texas where he discusses growing up with his brothers.  He talks about his family, his love of sports (football, baseball, weight training, tennis) and just growing up in general including his first relationship with his first wife.<br />From there he talks about how he got started in professional wrestling after dropping out of college after his college football career ended.  He discusses the genesis of his wrestling career in Chris Adam's wrestling school and with the Von Erich's World Class Championship Wrestling in Texas.  From there he chronologically follows his career with the Jarrett's USWA, Ted Turner's WCW, Paul Heyman's ECW and finally his getting into Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation.  He shares lots of stories about the promoters and wrestlers he met and learned from along the way and highlights some of his more prominent career highlights.<br />Overall, if you're a wrestling fan you'll love reading Austin's overall thoughts on the wrestling business as he gives you his honest opinion on it.  The vast majority of the book is basically Austin's experience in the business, his opinion on what the business is, how it should be run, etc.  He talks candidly about his feelings on what is wrong with the business and how it should get back to its \\"roots\\" like when he started in it.  He talks candidly about his relationship with Vince McMahon as well as goes behind the scenes with how his biggest feuds in the business were put together or got floundered.  We also get some of the dirty details behind his frustrating career in WCW as he saw it.<br />Overall, it's a real fascinating read to see the wrestling business from the eyes of the man who literally changed it.<br />In addition to the wrestling business he also \\"opens the door\\" a little to his private life where he candidly owns up to a lot of the mistakes he's made as a husband (three wives and counting) and he also takes a look back at some of the problems wrestlers have with their drug addictions, talking in depth over the sadness he felt when he friend and former tag partner Brian Pillman passed away.<br />THE CRITIQUE<br />As many reviewers have attested already, the biggest drawback to the book is that it leaves you wanting more.  Many of the chapters in the book are only a few pages long.  Obviously there's a lot more that Austin and his co-biographers could have shared but I'm of the opinion that what was shared was adequate.  The pace of the book reads very quickly and is very accessible.  The book itself does not say too little (like the Rock or Chyna's autobiographies which definitely SHOULD have been heavier on content and less on fluff) but you do have the \\"more COULD have been said\\" feeling.<br />THE COOL THING<br />The book is interspersed with \\"inserted commentary\\" by Austin's mother and father as well as his good friend and confidant \\"J.R.\\" Jim Ross.  The commentary adds some good extra insight to some of the points and stories Austin shares.  Various pictures and documents (letters, etc.) also highlight Austin's story where appropriate.  Overall, the presentation, save for a few typos, is well done.<br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Overall, while the book was a little sparse in parts, readers should be happy with Steve Austin's \\"The Stone Cold Truth.\\"  For wrestling fans you'll benefit from the insight into the wrestling business from its pre-eminent star.  For casual readers you'll love the story of how a \\"good old country boy\\" from Edna, Texas came out of nowhere and succeeded against the odds.  \\"And That's The Bottom Line, `Cause Stone Cold Said So!!!\\"<br />Total Pages:  312<BR>Total Read Time:  6 hours<br />Highest Recommendation	2003-11-16

Rowling's landmark Harry Potter series, makes its much-anticipated debut to the literary world and does not disappoint.<br />Though a whopping 870 pages, the book, much like its predecessors, is a fast read bound to keep audiences hooked and enthralled.<br />THE STORY:<br />Lord Voldemort's return has turned the Wizarding world upside-down.  Half the Wizarding world believes he is indeed back.  The other half believes the \\"rumors\\" and \\"stories\\" are outright lies.  Harry Potter is caught in the middle of it all - beloved hero to some, scorned pariah to most.<br />Chaos runs deep a thick through the Wizarding world.  Hogwarts and indeed the Ministry of Magic itself starts to come apart at the seems with a great schism and power struggle.  In the midst of it all Harry himself becomes victim to Anakin Skywalker-like anger issues.  At the same time Harry and his friends, now 5th year students at Hogwarts, come-of-age and must deal with their OWL level studies and of course, the pangs of teenage romance.<br />NIFTY-REVELATIONS:<br />Among some of the things we see here in Year 5 are... <br />1. A glimpse into Snape's past and his background with Prongs, Padfoot, Moony and Wormtail<br />2. The world of Giants<br />3. More revelations about Sirius Black and the \\"Noble and Most Ancient\\" Black family<br />4. More Death-Eaters and the Order of the Phoenix that opposes them<br />5. More about Harry's parents and their contemporaries<br />6. FINALLY, the complete story behind the mysterious connection between Harry and Lord Voldemort<br />THOUGHTS, COMPARISONS and CONTRASTS:<br />Rowling's writing style continues to simply enthrall you and draw you in.  Despite its unbelievable size you will be hard-pressed to put the book down as Rowling's writing style easily hooks you in and makes you WANT to find out what happens next.  (For myself I managed to finish the book in about 3 days with about three 7 hour marathon reading sessions last weekend).  More than any other book in this series, \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" is quite simply the most \\"emotional\\" out of all the books.  Harry's ordeal and mistreatment throughout the book simply will leave you seething as well with him.  You definitely will FEEL for him.<br />With a nearly complete world and cast of characters to pull from many of our friends from previous installments all make appearances in Order.<br />The previous books in the series were, aside from great fantasy novels, also great MYSTERY novels with big twists and turns.  This is not the case with \\"Order of the Phoenix.\\"  There are no mysteries here.  The book is simply what it appears to be, the prelude to a great big war.<br />The final chapters of the book, with its intense battles, are not only a prelude to what should be in store in Books 6 and 7 but also a nice \\"mental image\\" teaser to how awesome the battle will come out on the big screen should we ever be treated to an \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" movie.<br />THE VERDICT: <br />If you are already a Potter fan you've probably already read the book, if you aren't a fan (yet) check out this book and the rest and catch up with the rest of society (you WON'T be disappointed).<br />Total Read Time:  22 hours, spread out over 3 days<br />Highest Recommendation	2003-06-28

In the midst of his assignment, Bauer finds himself drawn into a very deep, and very personal plot that traces its roots to a failed mission he was assigned to a few years previous.  The men he was sent to take out are out to exact revenge on both he and David Palmer, the man who authorized the mission.<br />ABOUT THE BOOK:<br />\\"24: The House Special Subcommittee's Findings at CTU,\\" basically picks up where the 1st Season leaves off as Jack and his CTU comrades testify before a special House sub-committee assigned to ascertain the truth about the events that took place on the day of the California Presidential-primary.  The book recounts in great detail the events the took place that day (as seen on the show).  Beyond that though, the book also goes even deeper into the story chronicling the events of Operation Nightfall (Jack's failed mission that led to the Drazen assassination plot) as well as the events that took place immediately in the aftermath of Season One.  Aside from testimony from Jack and Tony Almeida the book also includes numerous character profiles (many taken from the 24 website and many seen for the first time in the book) plus other records such as autopsy reports, news statements, police statements and other official records.<br />THE COMPLETE PICTURE (?????)<br />This book is definitely the perfect companion to the first season.  It definitely answers many of the lingering questions that viewers may have had after watching the first season (such as why did Gaines try to kill Nina if they were on the same side?).  The books also stands alone from Season Two.  Reading this book will not give you any particular insight into the events of Season 2.   However, I can say this though, after reading this book you do come to realize one thing.  Well two things actually:<br />1. The plot in 24 against Jack and Palmer runs VERY deep, more than you'll ever know from watching BOTH Seasons 1 and 2.<br />2. The writers of the show are probably the best writing team there is on television today<br />I'm very much looking forward to seeing how the plot thread lines connect even more in Season 3.<br />Tick, tick, tick, tick...<br />Total Read Time:  8 hours, spread across three evenings<br />Must Read (for fans of the show)	2003-06-28

His first book \\"The Buzz on Pro-Wrestling\\" was released to mixed reviews in 2001.  His follow-up book, \\"Tonight In This Very Ring\\" shows marked improvement from the first effort.<br />THE BOOK:<br />Keith starts off with a very quick intro into the history of the business and the founding of the WWF and its early years.  The vast majority of the book covers the recent history of the WWE from their doldrums of the mid-90s through the late 90s boom period before wrapping up with the events of the past year.  In it he discusses not only the events we saw as fans on TV but also a lot of the \\"behind-the-scenes\\" real-life stories about the talent and much of the backstage turmoil that went on.  In between Keith also highlights many of the key matches that took place over the years by including many of his infamous \\"Smark Rant\\" match reviews.<br />THE COOL STUFF:<br />Keith's writing style is easily described as either \\"you love it, or you hate it.\\"  You'll either find the biting sarcasm hilariously funny or you'll find it pompous.  What I personally enjoyed about this book was Keith's comparison of the WWE story to other literary works or historical events.  For example, his equating of the WWE doldrum years to both the King Lear story (McMahon's burial of the loyal Bret Hart to the \\"less-than\\" sincere Shawn Michaels and Kevin Nash) as well the Biblical story of Lazarus (their rise from the Doldrums to the Heights of the Attitude Era boom period) was pure genius.<br />THE CRITIQUE:<br />Admittedly, much of the material in the book (like his Match Rants and other remarks) can be found in the collected writings on his website so many long-time Keith readers have already heard a \\"good portion\\" of what he has to say in this book.  So, if you are a Keith reader don't be surprised if a lot of what you are reading sounds familiar.<br />THE VERDICT:<br />Overall, \\"Tonight In This Very Ring\\" is a great collection of the WWE's history as seen through the eyes of one of its fans (not matter how jaded).  If you are a fan of WWE you'll appreciate seeing the Fed through Keith's unique point-of-view, whether or not you agree with his take.  If you are a Keith fan then you definitely want to pick this up.  If you are not, then by all means take a pass.<br />Highly Recommended	2003-04-12

This makes the book easy to follow along with and helps to reinforce the concepts.

For those who are more advanced in the field this book will probably not tell you anything new and you can take a pass on it (and stop reading here).  If you are looking for the basics though, you've come to the right place.<br />THE CONTENTS:<br />Here are the topics that Hubbell addresses:<br />1.

Overview of CSS<br />THE ANALYSIS:<br />Overall, this book is a great teaching and learning tool to the basics of web design.  Hubbell has struck that fine balance between covering in good detail the basics of what you need to know versus information overload.  Overall the book is very thorough and takes you through the web design process for beginning to end and it manages to do so without overwhelming you.<br />Each chapter is broken up into small lessons and at the end there are exercises for you to follow.  All of them are well designed and good you and good grounding into the basics.  <br />Hubbell also does a great job of presenting the various HTML tags.  She goes over what they are and also thoroughly discusses the various switches that accompany them and their functions.  She also includes the source code as well as a screen shot of what the completed web pages look like.  While not going into things completely in depth on the source code as some otherbooks do, this book accomplishes its task well, giving you a \\"basic\\" understanding of HTML.  Students can easily go through and pick apart and learn the code on their own from the basics that Hubbell provides (which ultimately when you learn a programming language you're going to have to do anyway, pick it apart and do trial and error...).<br />THE VERDICT:<br />Overall, Hubbell does a fine job of covering the various technologies and issues that deal with web development.

Whether you are studying this subject independently or whether you are an instructor looking to use this book for your course, Hubbell's  \\"Understanding Web Development\\" is a fine choice.<br />Highly Recommended	2003-01-04

While a thorough text (no stone is left unturned), it does have a major drawback - namely its size and accessibility.<br />THE GOOD:<br />Cooper and Schindler offer up a thorough text which takes the reader/student through the complete research process from start to finish.  Again, it is very detailed about the research process and any student who can make it through the text will come away from a very solid grounding in the research process.  The research process is well described and real life examples abound through case studies which bring the topics close to home.<br />THE BAD:<br />At about 700 pages the text is VERY cumbersome and quite the chore to finish.  The great thing about this book is that it is very detailed.  The problem with this though, it that it is TOO detailed.  The writing, while thorough, can probably best be described as \\"bland\\" (like the subject itself).  Research methods, more than likely, DOES NOT top most students' list of favorite courses to take no matter how smart or motivated they are.  Having a humongous tome of a subject that is not all that popular or accessible probably does not score points with most people.  Research methods for most is an archaic subject, very difficult to understand or enjoy.  This text, because of the subject matter, its size and bland tone, will probably fly over the heads of most students.  If you are a student planning to read this book or if you are an instructor thinking of using this text, keep this in mind.<br />This textbook was used as one of the texts for a graduate level research methods course I took.  The vast majority of those in my class (myself included) barely did any of the readings from this text.  It was a very \\"dry\\" read.<br />THE VERDICT:<br />While Cooper and Schindler do an awesome job of covering the ins and outs of the research process, I find it unlikely most students will actually take the time to read this.  This book, while thorough, is just not that accessible to the average student.  If you are an instructor, think to yourself, when you were a student would YOU have read a 700 page, hard to read, book on a subject that you probably at best didn't really care about all that much?<br />For an alternative text of this subject I recommend Leedy and Omrod's \\"Practical Research.\\"<br />It is safe to say that on a whole, when it comes to buy back time at the college bookstore, this book will probably be in \\"near mint\\" condition for most students.<br />Mild Recommendation	2002-09-15

This biography of Fritzs and his familys story is the by-product of what Fritz related to Ron during his final months.<br />The account is no-holds barred and you get a good look into the lifes story of a man who, along with his sons, became a bona fide wrestling legend as well as tragic heroes.  The book integrates narratives from the author, Fritz, Kevin as well as numerous news story transcripts which document the various stories of the familys tragic lives.  You will feel the ups and downs of their lives included their moments of greatness as well as their moments of despair.<br />THE CONTENTS:<br />Among the thing youll read about:<br />1. Jack Adkissons childhood growing up in Texas learning to hunt and fish.<br />2. His athletic background including his time playing college football at SMU and in the early pros.<br />3. His meeting his wife Doris and their clandestine wedding.<br />4. His breaking into the wrestling business after ending his pro-ball career and working odd jobs.<br />5. His traveling like a gypsy on the independent circuit up North including Canada, New York and Minnesota.<br />6. His rise and development of the World Class territory in Texas.<br />7. The TRUE circumstances that led to the deaths of his 5 sons, Jack Jr., David, Mike, Chris and Kerry and his divorce from his wife of 40 years.<br />8.

Fritz, Doris and Kevins reflections on their lives.<br />11. Their views on the wrestling world as it is today and their impact in the grand scheme of things.<br />THE VERDICT:  <br />In all, the book, while marred by a good number of spelling and grammatical errors and a little awkwardly began, is a very powerful story.  Fritz, Doris and Kevins thoughts on life and wrestling are truly amazing.  The book is very emotional in content.  A large portion of the book is basically a tribute to lives and careers of the 5 deceased Von Erich boys.  The story, while sad, is compelling. <br />In sum, Mr. Mullinax, while self-admittedly not an author, did achieve his objective.  His book is a powerful tribute to a group of great men and beloved men, whom through fate faced some overwhelming challenges in their lives.  The book was not quite as in-depth as I would have preferred it to be as far as family stories went, BUT it is a fine tribute which any wrestling fan, especially any Von Erich fan, should enjoy.<br />Pages: 207<BR>Total Read Time:  7 hours over 3 days<br />Must-Read (for Von Erich fans)<BR>Highly Recommended (for everyone else)	2002-05-30

In this first novel of the epic series of seven, J.K. Rowling introduces us to the world of Harry Potter and Hogwarts.<br />Basically summed up, this is the story of Harry Potter, a young boy who grew up in an abusive home with his aunt and uncle, not thinking there was anything special about himself but in fact discovers that he is perhaps (to his utter surprise) the most famous wizard of modern times, bound by destiny to the most powerful and evil wizard of all time.<br />The book (and in the fact the rest of the series) follows Harry's adventures with his friends Ron and Hermione and fellow classmates as they make there way through 7 years of wizards school at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, surviving treacherous schoolyard bullies and rivals, an interesting assortment of teachers and classmates and just the pure subtleties of adolescence - all the while battling the forces of evil.  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone introduces the story and follows his adventures in his first year of school.<br />Enthralling and funny and very much captivating, Rowling's writing style is refreshing.  Like a good mystery and a thriller, Rowling leaves on the edge of your seat as you, along with Harry and his friends, attempt to discover \\"who-done-it.\\"  In this case, Harry and friends uncover a plot by an evil wizard trying to attempt to steal a powerful stone that may very well bring back to power the most evil wizard known to man.<br />As is the case in all of Rowling's books, all is not as it seems.  The Harry Potter books have truly achieved a pop culture icon status over the last few years and reading through the books it is easy to see why.  They are simply that good.  Whether you are a child or an adult, you'll love Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, as well as all the other books in the series.<br />My total read time:  9 hours, 1 night.<br />Total pages:  308.<br />Highest Recommendation	2002-01-03

US	49128332	R2Q1BEGGIITHUM	1550224980	212401990	Missy Hyatt: First Lady of Wrestling	Books	5	19	20	N	N	The Story of Melissa...	Missy Hyatt was one of the first \\"modern day\\" wrestling divas and a pretty big star throughout the 80's and early 90's.  This book is the story of her life and her career in the world of professional wrestling.<br />The writing style is pretty decent and comes across more as a \\"talk-story\\" session at the coffee shop.  It's very easy (and fast) to read.  Many of the wrestling fans \\"in the know\\" know about Missy's legendary promiscuity which the quotes on the back cover will allude to, but to be honest, the book is \\"relatively\\" clean and not the sleezy \\"kiss and tell all\\" book you'd think it would be.  Of course she does give a laundry list of sorts of the many, many men she's been with in her life, but it's nothing overly filthy.  In a movie rating it would be about a PG-13.<br />Overall, this book is just a neat story about a pretty average girl named Melissa and the MANY cool experiences, places and people she's had, seen and met throughout her life, not only in her wrestling career, but also as a celebrity.<br />In the book you get:<br />-    A quick rundown of her childhood<br />- Her start in the wrestling business as a \\"groupie\\"<br />- Her pretty messed up relationship with Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts<br />- Her relationship with \\"Hollywood\\" John Tatum<br />- The formation of the \\"Missy Hyatt\\" character in WCCW and her program with Sunshine and Scott Casey<br />- Her stay in Bill Watt's UWF and program with Jack Victory, Dark Journey and the Missing Link and great stories about Sting, Steiner and J.R.<br />- The cute story of her courtship, life and marriage (and eventual divorce) to the late, great \\"Hot Stuff\\" Eddie Gilbert while in the UWF.<br />- Her and Eddie's travels through the Memphis territory and the CWF<br />- Her BRIEF stint as a WWF Superstar with \\"Missy's Manor\\" and some great tales about her meeting with Vince McMahon<br />- Her rocky career in the WCW with some great tales about her meeting with Ted Turner, Ric Flair and Eric Bischoff<br />- Her relationship with Jason Hervey (Wayne Arnold (the big brother) from the Wonder Years)<br />- Her many, many flings thereafter (football players, hockey players, other wrestlers...)<br />- Her career in ECW with the Sandman and friendship with Paul Heyman<br />- Her current whereabouts (current career and college, but no mention of her `adult' website).<br />Overall, Missy's got some GREAT stories to share about all the people and places she's been to (and been with), and met.  She has tons of great stories from the road and \\"backstage/off-camera\\" anecdotes about a lot of the others in the business.  Among others she shares things about are Paul E, the Freebirds, Luger, Buff Bagwell, Road Warrior Hawk, Tommy Rich, Brutus Beefcake, Dr. Tom Pritchard, Shane McMahon and a HILARIOUS story about Val Venis.<br />I particularly enjoyed her stories about her relationship with Eddie Gilbert, being a fan of both of their work.  It's just really sad things didn't work out between them and I could sense a lot of that sadness when she talked about him.  It's obvious that there were still some strong feelings there.  To me, it's equally sad that Eddie never did get the big breaks he deserved in the business because he was just ultra-talented...<br />Overall, this is a great book to read.  It definitely holds its own up against the other wrestling autobiographies of recent years (and is A LOT better than an autobiography written by some OTHER female wrestling personality earlier this year...).  She comes across as honest and real and the stories she has to share are great and even pretty funny.  I wish there was more to read but what she says is short, sweet and to the point.  There's also tons of GREAT photos in here of Missy and some of the other great wrestlers and celebrities she's met. The book is fairly short (at 164 pages) and it reads fast.  I got through it in 3 sittings, total read time about 6 hours.  In sum, if you're a wrestling fan you should love and enjoy Missy Hyatt:First Lady of Professional Wrestling.<br />Highly Recommended	2001-12-02
US	49128332	R25RDA6V1RDZ5N	0953709701	697395678	Pure Dynamite	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Dynamite Book!!!	Without the benefit of the multi-million dollar marketing machine of the WWF,  Pure Dynamite unfortunately slipped past the radar of a lot of wrestling fans which is definitely unfortunate.  Having read most of the wrestling autobiographies of recent years I will attest that Tom \\"Dynamite Kid\\" Billington's book is probably the best of the whole bunch (with the possible exception of Mick Foley).<br />This book is basically the chronological life story of Tom \\"Dynamite Kid\\" Billington, believed by MANY to have been the best technical wrestler throughout the 70's and 80's and a wrestling legend throughout Japan, Canada, Europe.  He was best known in the U.S. as one half of the British Bulldogs tag team in the 1980s WWF.<br />Here are the main highlights of the book:<br />- He describes his childhood and how he broke into the business as a teenager and his beginnings in the British independent scene<br />- He details his meeting with the Hart family and how he trained further and wrestled for the Harts in the Stampede promotion in Canada<br />- His journeys into other territories like the Pacific Northwest, tours of Germany and Hawaii<br />- He details his legendary career in Japan (All Japan and New Japan) and his battles with Tiger Mask<br />- He talks about his teaming with his cousin Davey Boy Smith (the British Bulldog)<br />- He details his beginnings and career with Vince McMahon and the WWF<br />- HIGHLIGHT:  He goes into VAST detail about the dangers of the wrestling world and life on the road with drugs (not only steroids) and the numerous risks and pounding his body took with his wrestling \\"bumps\\" over the years.<br />- HIGHLIGHT:  He talks about all the \\"ribs\\" (pranks) he's pulled over the years with other wrestlers<br />- HIGHLIGHT:  Tons of anecdotes about life on the road with (and his blunt assessments of) all the other wrestlers of his time including notable legends like:  Bret Hart, Harley Race, Terry Funk, Antonio Inoki, Giant Baba, Abdullah the Butcher, Dan Spivey and WWF 80s stars like Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage, Don Muraco, Billy Jack Haynes, Hercules, Nikolai Volkoff, the Iron Sheik, Bob Backlund, the Rougeaus, etc <br />Overall, this is simply a GREAT collection of the history of the sport and one man's perspective on it over a near 20-year period.  Dynamite literally talks about his dealings with the all the big names, including GREAT stories from the road.  Aside from that though, more than just about any other book out there, he tells about of the DANGERS of life on the road including the boozing, the drugs, the fighting, etc.  He goes into strong detail about how on numerous times he literally lost his life due to problems with steroid and other drug abuse.<br />Obviously meant for a more mature audience, there's tons of swearing and drug references in here.  If you've read all the other wrestler biographies and not this one, DO NOT PASS THIS ONE UP.  It is one of the best.  If you are interested in learning more about wrestling or becoming a wrestler, this is REQUIRED reading.<br />Highest Recommendation	2001-11-25

Kurt Angle is a legendary, contemporary, amateur championship wrestler who parlayed his mega-successful amateur background into the realm of professional wrestling's \\"sports entertainment.\\"  This is his autobiography.  Kurt Angle's \\"It's True, It's True\\" is an inspirational story about an extraordinary man who's succeeded and excelled at whatever he's put his mind too.<br />The book basically takes a chronological look at his life.  The book opens by detailing his most triumphant moment, his winning of the Olympic Gold Medal in the 1996 Atlanta Games.  From there the book chronicles, in good, honest detail, the story of his life.  We begin with a detailed look into his childhood and family where Kurt grew up with his ultra-competitive and ultra-athletic four brothers and \\"functioning alcoholic father.\\"  From there he recounts the story of his father's tragic passing in a construction accident, the turning point in his life and the catalyst for his lifelong desire to be the best at everything in honor of his father's memory.<br />From there, my favorite part of his story begins, his looooong trek toward becoming the legendary wrestler he became.  He recounts his college wrestling career and how he went \\"professional\\" competing in the International free-style level.  His stories of the intensity of amateur level competition and traveling abroad, particularly in Eastern Europe and Russia, are simply amazing, to me, and are worth the price of admission.  From there you take a look into his nearly psychotic training regimen he put himself through as he prepared for the Olympic games.  Rocky Balboa's got NOTHING on Kurt Angle...<br />Following the Olympics the recounts the (ever so fleeting) celebrity status he received and the jobs he took on afterward including motivational speaking and sportscasting, not to mention meeting his future wife.<br />The second half of the book recounts his career in the World Wrestling Federation to date (Summer of 2001).  Unlike other wrestler biographies of recent years, Kurt's recounting of his career doesn't really come across as \\"sports-entertainment/personal hype\\" (as like say, the Rock's autobiography...).  Kurt's assessment is actually rather very honest and provides a deeper look into the psychology of the business.  Kurt offers a deeper look into how the matches are set-up.  His contrasting of the amateur style versus the \\"sports-entertainment\\" style is a very refreshing and enlightening look.  Kurt also does a great job of relating just how demanding the lifestyle of a traveling performer is.  He cites early difficulties in his marriage, the often scary nature of encountering ignorant fans with a grudge and the horrendous travel schedule.  This should be of particular interest to any who are interested in becoming a professional wrestler.  This is definitely a good \\"behind the scenes look\\" at the business.<br />Overall, you'll love this book.  You'll gain a ton of respect for Kurt Angle.  He's definitely a great guy and you're bound to identify with his story.  He's an everyman.  It's honest, it's compelling and it's just a great story.  I read it in one day, total read time about 9 hours.  Whether you're a fan of athletics, professional wrestling, or just a person who likes you to read, you're bound to love this book.  Oh It's True, It's True!!! <br />Highly Recommended	2001-10-21
US	49128332	R3FIN88FYRUP9U	1573061336	772180674	Red Sun: The Invasion of Hawaii After Pearl Harbor	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Fascinating...What If???	This book is fascinating, and a definite keeper, on many levels.  First off, the book gives you a very accurate look into the history of the Hawaiian islands from the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom by greedy American businessmen (a little known fact that is very much overlooked in the annals of history), to the rise of the sugar plantations which led to the import of thousands of indentured immigrant (Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, etc) workers during the 1800s and 1900s to, of course, the fateful bombing of December 7, 1941.<br />The most fascinating part about this book is the \\"alternative\\" history it presents.  The primary question posed by this book is \\"What if Japan had conquered Hawaii following Pearl Harbor?\\"  The fictional events presented in this book are shockingly real possibilities once you examine the evidence (which the book does).<br />The story unfolds creatively through three dynamic viewpoints:  Vignettes, Views and Vistas.  Vignettes are events that are told in third person which give an immediate telling of events.  Views are events told from first hand viewpoint through the eyes of four fictional members of an American-Japanese family over the course of three generations.  Finally, Vistas are the broad historical view of events as presented by a fictional modern day history professor as he presents a lecture series.  Collectively, these unique views give a very powerful presentation of the real events that led up Pearl Harbor and the fictional events that very well could have took place in the alternate history.<br />Overall, the story covers a span of over 100 years from the 1860s when the first immigrant workers arrived in Hawaii till the 1960s.  You'll be amazed by the stories that Ziegler and Patterson portray.  Plus, you'll learn a good deal of Hawaiian history.  The images that they paint are often times horrifying and disturbing and very graphic.<br />As the book cover says, imagine the following:  <br />1. Diamond Head Crater as a POW camp?<br />2. Comfort women in Waikiki for Japanese soldiers?<br />3. Popular beaches teaming with landmines?<br />4. The restoration of the Hawaiian Kingdom?<br />Overall, the book is a fascinating read.  The political games played by the Japanese to manipulate and control the population are a fascinating read.  The military events (campaigns, guerrilla warfare, atrocities committed against POWs) are both griping and horrifying.  You'll be glued to the book.  <br />However, be forewarned, you may find some portions of this book to be very controversial (politically speaking).  Also, some of the graphic descriptions of war and its horrors are not for the faint of heart.  If you can get past these though, I guarantee you'll be entertained (and educated) by this book.<br />Highest Recommendation.	2001-10-17
US	49128332	R3NQAAZUBOCLM1	1576731758	19658905	Every Man Has His Price: The True Story of Wrestling's Million-Dollar Man	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Truly Powerful -- A Story of a Man and His Faith	Being a huge wrestling fan and a fan of the \\"Million Dollar Man\\" Ted DiBiase (one of wrestling's premiere stars over the past two decades), I was naturally drawn to read his autobiography.  Having read this and a majority of the other wrestler autobiographies of recent years, I can easily say that DiBiase's \\"Every Man Has His Price\\" is clearly in a league of its own.  While most of his colleagues detail there in-ring careers DiBiase's, while doing just that, actually goes FAR BEYOND the mere scopes of his wrestling career.  \\"Every Man Has His Price\\" truly is the man's life story.  It is the story of how he overcame personal demons to find the glory of the Lord.<br />This book was a true joy to read.  It was brutally honest and you see the true side of Ted DiBiase.  He literally is NOTHING like the character he portrayed on WWF television for nearly a decade.  The book basically breaks up the story into three parts:<br />1. The first half of the book discusses his childhood and his relationship with his dad.  It also describes his love of football and how he \\"grew up in the wrestling business.\\"  You become strongly aware of just how strong a family man he is.  Over half of the book talks about his love for his dad, his grandmother and his family.<br />2. A quarter of the book talks about his wrestling career.  You'll find out how he broke into the wrestling business and how he \\"paid his dues\\" working throughout the Mid-South, Texas, Kansas City, the East Coast and Georgia territories and how he became the \\"Million Dollar Man.\\"<br />3. The rest of the book talks about how life on the road and its temptations nearly destroyed himself and his family and how he received redemption by finding God and Christ.  The religious overtones of this book were obvious throughout its entirety but the story of how Jesus saved his life was a VERY powerful story and image throughout the ending of the book.<br />Overall, I would call this book a \\"Chicken Soup for the Christian's Soul.\\"This book is a very powerful testament to the power of Christ, just as DiBiase had hoped it would be.  It you are a wrestling fan looking for a little inside scoop or a little history to the wrestling business, or if you are a big DiBiase fan looking to learn a little more about him this book DOES deliver that.  However, in the scheme of things that is just a mere side note to the book.  The real message of the book is about finding salvation and repentance in the Lord.  <br />DiBiase's story is really powerful, brutal, honest and emotional.  I read this book in ONE sitting, total reading time about 5 hours.  I literally did not put it down.  You will enjoy this book.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-08-06

Overall, this book was pretty good.  It is great for what it is, a good look into his life (as all biographies SHOULD be) and a great look into how his wrestling character and career evolved.<br />Here&#8217;s what we learn about Goldberg:  <br />1. First and foremost we learn about his football career (and perhaps manhood) ending injury.<br />2. How he got into the wrestling business through his association with tons of WCW wrestlers whom he worked out at the gym with including Sting, Luger, DDP and Buff Bagwell.<br />3. A VERY comprehensive look at how he broke into the business, including negotiating with both the WWF and WCW, his training at the WCW Power Plant and the evolution of the Goldberg character including look, fighting style, etc.<br />4. A comprehensive look at his ENTIRE WCW career from start to (at the time) present.  It&#8217;s an honest, unbiased look at how Goldberg quickly rose through the ranks.  He is very honest about his capabilities and how he has been privileged.  He does not have a &#8220;big head&#8221; whatsoever.<br />5. A look into his family background. (with Guest Chapter Authoring&#8217;s by Goldberg&#8217;s dad and brother)<br />6. A look at his ENTIRE football career from high school to college to WFL (World League), brush with the Canadian CFL to the NFL.<br />In addition to this, you also get a great look into the MIND of Goldberg.  He comes off as an intelligent and a very genuine individual who has deep beliefs and deep convictions.  You&#8217;ll learn his views of how to handle business, his strong feelings for his family and friends, and his thoughts on other wrestlers and other celebrities, and his thoughts on religion (including a great view of how it is to be a ... role model), football and hisdeep love for his animals and his girlfriend.  <br />Also, the book contains some GREAT anecdotes and stories from Bill&#8217;s life including his childhood, GREAT college football stories and an AWESOME SuperBowl story about him and Scott Steiner.<br />Here&#8217;s my rundown:<br />Great:  The anecdotes and stories about his football career and his life in the public eye<br />Good:  Delving deep into Goldberg&#8217;s mind.  He comes across as just a GREAT guy, full of convictions and strong beliefs.<br />Cool:  TONS of great pictures of him and his family, friends and other celebrity friends<br />For our wrestling fans:  How he broke into the business and developed his character.  It&#8217;s a great behind the scenes look.<br />Nice Touch:  Having both his dad and brother write chapters in the book.  He clearly is a strong family man.<br />Bad:  Nothing at all<br />Summed up, this is just a great book to read.  It may never become a &#8220;literary&#8221; classic, but it&#8217;s just a great biography about a great person and his story.  Goldberg has often been harshly and sharply criticized, sometimes perhaps deservedly so.  However, once you read his book he easily comes across as an honest man.  <br />All in all, I highly recommend this to other wrestling fans.  It&#8217;s a great look into the life and times of one of wrestling&#8217;s biggest contemporary stars.  I also recommend this to those who want to BECOME a wrestler.  It&#8217;s a good look into how one career evolved.  You&#8217;ll benefit from what Bill has to say about getting into the business.  Finally, I recommend this to anyone who just likes to read about other people&#8217;s lives.  This is a great book to read.  It&#8217;s funny and is just a great story.  At about 245 pages I got through this in about 3 days, total reading time about 6 hours.  This is a good book.<br />Recommended.	2001-07-23
US	49128332	R2CHD8X7LWHWP1	0966324609	380761054	Arn Anderson 4 Ever: A Look Behind the Curtain	Books	5	5	9	N	N	Much Like Arn Himself, It's Just Darn Good	All in all, Arn Anderson 4 Ever:  A Look Behind the Curtain is, simply put, a darn good book.  The book is all that it maintains to be, a look at his life and the 15 years he spent in the wrestling business.  The book chronicles his life from his very humble childhood beginnings ALL the way up until the end of his career.  In sum, it is a great look at his life and his wrestling career.  It is the story of a man achieving his American dream.<br />In all, I believe this book will be of benefit and interest to three distinct groups of people.  First and foremost, I believe this is REQUIRED READING for ANYONE who has ever fancied the thought of becoming a pro-wrestler.  Perhaps better than any of the other wrestler biographies out there, Arn's book REALLY paints a clear cut picture of how grueling life on the road truly can be.  You get a real feel for the thousands of miles traveled for peanuts, the thousands of days spent away from family, and the interesting characters you meet and deal with when leading that lifestyle.  Also, he paints a very realistic picture of what it takes to make it in this business including surviving on the road,  getting along with the boys in the locker room and having that OLD SCHOOL mentality about having respect for the business and the boys that came before you and giving your 110% in all that you do.  He clearly chronicles how he broke into the business and how he survived (and ultimately thrived) in it.  In my opinion, this is required text (along with Foley's books and Gary Michael Cappetta's book) for Wrestling 101.<br />Secondly, I believe this book will be of benefit to any wrestling fan.  Arn is one of the all-time respected vets in the business.  Wrestling fans will marvel at his stories of his fifteen years in the business.  The story starts of on how big a fan he was as a child, to how he trained and broke in and his tours throughout the independent circuits in Georgia, Mid-South and Florida.  The remainder of the text chronicles the NWA history of the 4 Horsemen, his brief stint as a Brainbuster in the WWF and the &quot;mid-90s&quot; depression in WCW with the Dangerous Alliance to the rebirth of the Horsemen and the rise of the      NW O.  In all, it is a great tour de force of his wrestling career and basically a summary/history of the &quot;modern-era&quot; of pro-wrestling.  In addition to this, you'll also marvel at the GREAT ROAD STORIES he has about a lot the boys he's traveled with.  If you are into adventure tales you'll love what Arn has to say about the many, many, travels he has done across the country and what has to say about a lot of the other wrestlers.   It's a great tale for wrestling fans.<br />Another great feature of the novel are the little &quot;aside excerpts&quot; where Arn (or guest writers) give their little takes on some of the issues in wrestling or on other wrestlers.  This was especially nice to read.  It was a &quot;nice touch.&quot;<br />Finally, I believe this book would be of interest to ANYONE who just wants to read the story about a man and his dream.  This book is like Chicken Soup for the Workerman's Soul.  It's just good tale about a man, his dream and how he achieved it.  It's also the story of a man and his family.  You'll really see a side of the Enforcer that the camera never captures.  He comes across truly as a great family man with all the mush he writes about his granny, wife and children.  You come away with a great feeling in the end when you see how Arn went from his humble beginning's in a little shack in Georgia with his grandparents to the summit of his professional with his wife and two kids.  In all, it's a great story of the American Dream (no NOT Dusty Rhodes...)<br />Highly Recommended.	2001-07-16
US	49128332	R1CFIRUBOE71EK	0060392983	606000879	The Rock Says...	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Overall an &quot;Okay&quot; Book	Overall, this is an &quot;okay&quot; book which should appeal to fans of the Rock and fans of professional wresting.  If you're a wrestling fan who's looking for some great &quot;inside&quot; scoops about the wrestling business or wrestling personalities, you're probably not gonna get what you are looking for. (For that I recommend Mick Foley's books or Gary Michael Cappetta's book).  However, if you are a Rock fan who wants to know everything about your favorite wrestler, you've come to the right place.<br />The book basically follows a chronological history of Dwayne Johnson's life detailing how he grew up in the wrestling business, his childhood, his adolescence, his &quot;playa&quot; styled lovelife (bad boy Rock), his college years, his career in the CFL, and his eventual rise in the wrestling business.  You'll also get a nice look into his family life where he talks about his parents and how he met his wife and the problems he had with his in-laws at the outset.  Once he hits the wrestling business he details how he trained and broke into the business and from there he basically chronicles his ENTIRE WWF career up to the present.  If you've followed the business for the past several years there's nothing new in here that you didn't know already.  However, he does give a nice insight into how his Wrestlemania 15 match with Steve Austin was booked though.<br />Overall the book is &quot;okay.&quot;  My personal favorite parts of the book were not the wrestling related parts because most of that stuff &quot;you&quot; already know.  My personal favorite part was where he recounted the horrors of being in the CFL.  You'll be amazed at how a bonafide millionaire (today) actually started out with basically next to nothing (poorer than poor)!!!<br />Here's my rundown:<br />Great:  The CFL horror stories, college stories and his &quot;mack dad&quot; stories with the ladies.<br />Okay/So-so:  The VERY COMPREHENSIVE recounting of his WWF career (which pretty much comes across as WWF/The Rock hype).<br />Bad:  Nothing really...It's just an &quot;okay&quot; book.<br />Overall, it's a nice biography about his life and an overall interesting read, but nothing overly enthralling.<br />Mildly Recommended	2001-06-06
US	49128332	R1TW5SF45OW9SN	0060393297	115507970	If They Only Knew	Books	3	12	15	N	N	YIKES!!! An Okay Book... (Borrow it...)	Overall, I'd classify this book as being \\"okay.\\"  One thing that is obviously evident in this book is that Chyna DEFINITELY has tons of \\"issues.\\"  Overall, it is definitely a no-holds barred look into her life.<br />The first 70 pages or so of the book is PURE RANT where Chyna goes off about her dysfunctional family.  It was definitely hard for me to get through this portion of the book because of its emotional content (can you say bitter?).  Once I got past that portion though, the story picks up well.  Chyna discusses the many, many, many odd jobs she worked (900 number operator, pager salesperson, belly dancer, etc) her past relationships with men, her close call with cancer, her bodybuilding/fitness competition career and the prejudice she received, and, of course, how she got into the wrestling business (joining Killer Kowalski's school, wrestling the independents and breaking into, and succeeding, in the WWF).  The most interesting part of the story for me, being a wrestling fan, was how she broke into the business.<br />Overall, the one comment I make about the book is that she definitely has an interesting story to tell, but she doesn't really delve all that deep into it, with the exception of her obvious dislike she has of her parents.  I personally would have liked to have heard more about the odd jobs she did.<br />When I finished reading the book (did it in about 10 hours) I was like \\"geez\\" this poor girl's had a pretty harsh life.  From the tone of her \\"voice\\" in the book it is quite obvious.  If the publishing industry actually rated these books for content, Chyna's \\"If They Only Knew\\" would definitely get like a PG-13 or an R.  This is definitely not something the kid's should read on their own.  Tons of graphic language in this one.  On the upside though, there are TONS of great pictures in here.  Unfortunately, the captions for them are at the END of the book.<br />Great:  Triple H and Mick Foley do a \\"guest spot\\" in the middle of her book sharing some stories.<br />Good:  The stories about her odd-jobs, her bodybuilding/fitness pageant career, her stories about the WWF, the pictures.<br />Bad:  The first 70 pages about the horrors of her parents.  Obviously, it was an important part of the story, but geez.... Photo captions at the BACK of the book and NOT with the photos???<br />Ugly:  How they spelled Shawn Michaels name as \\"Sean\\" and how they referred to Benoit's finishing move as the \\"Cross-face Crippler\\" and not the correct \\"Crippler Cross-face.\\"<br />This book will probably be most beneficial to Chyna fans.  Wrestling fans will have a mild interest in this.  If you don't fall into either category you could probably take a pass on this one.  Overall, it is an \\"okay\\" book, but not a must read.  <br />Recommendation to borrow and read it.	2001-05-20
US	49128332	R3Q48FK8DW5PWL	0970399162	860393045	Bodyslams!  Memoirs of a Wrestling Pitchman	Books	5	6	7	N	N	An Amazing Story!!!  Highly Recommended	This book, without having the benefit of the big marketing push of some of its other wrestling autobiographical brethen, seems to have easily slipped pass the radar.  This is very unfortunate because having read many of the other wrestling autobiographies of recent years, I easily attest that this book is just as compelling (if not even moreso) a story as those others.<br />This book is a GREAT living history of the wrestling business over the past 30 years.  I highly recommend this book to ALL wrestling fans.<br />Gary recounts countless stories of his travels throughout the world and the many legendary (and even non-legendary) wrestling personalities that he's met and worked with over the years.  It is truly a great story of a man and his very unique experiences traveling and working around the world (literally).<br />What sets this book apart from its contemporaries, however, is his true no-holds barred storytelling.  Gary pulls no punches as he discloses the VERY unseedy side of the wrestling business along with some of its more &quot;infamous&quot; incidents.  From his humble beginnings as a fan to his early years working with the McMahons to his journeys through the independent wrestling promotions to his years with Ted Turner's WCW, you'll gain a very clear cut picture of just how the wrestling business truly is.  It is an amazing story.  The story definite benefits from Gary's unique perspective on the business, not as a wrestler, but as a side man.  It is definitely a unique view.  I also heavily recommend this to anyone WANTING TO GET INTO THE BUSINESS.  You will benefit from his knowledge.<br />Here's my rundown:<br />Good:  AWESOME anecdotes of road trips with wrestlers.  Great &quot;inside the business&quot; scoops.  You'll get a true feel for what it is like being a wrestler always on the go.  This is definitely the most worthwhile aspect of the book.  Once the story really picks up its very compelling.<br />Nice:  Each chapter is introduced with quotes from other people who've written biographies.  It is a nice touch which sets a nice tone leading into each chapter.<br />Bad:  A fair amount of grammatical and spelling errors.  Nothing worse than glaring spelling errors to marr a good book.<br />UGLY:  Quite a few factual errors.  Three come to mind.  First, Mick Foley's wife's name is Colette, not Nicole.  Second, Mark Callaway actually REPLACED Sid Vicious to team with Dan Spivey as the Skyscrapers.  The book recounts Callaway teamed with Sid.  Third, I've heard stories contrary as to how Steve Austin got his ringname.  It was a promoter who dubbed him Steve Austin, not Austin himself who dubbed himself so because he was a big &quot;Bionic Man&quot; fan.<br />Overall, an awesome read.  Even if you are NOT a wrestling fan, you'll amaze at this man's interesting life and experiences. You will not be disappointed by this book.  Therefore, BUY (or borrow) and read this one.<br />Highly Recommended (if not for some grammer, spelling, factual errors, it would be a HIGHEST recommendation).	2001-05-18
US	49128332	R1J5X6T29AR3DW	0060393009	59636792	Foley Is Good: And the Real World Is Faker Than Wrestling	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Bravo Mick!!!!  A Brilliant Work.  Highest Recommendation	\\"Foley is Good,\\" the follow up to Mick Foley's best-selling \\"Have a Nice Day\\" is just as equally entertaining and worthwhile to read as the first book.  If you've read the first book you no doubt thought Mick said everything he could, right?  You could not be anymore wrong however.<br />\\"Foley is Good,\\" is a brilliant piece of work that contains several elements.  First and foremost, you'll get to meet \\"Mick Foley Superdad\\" and \\"Mick Foley the Man.\\"  He spends a great amount of time talking about his family and his love of amusement parks with GREAT stories and even several of \\"Mick's Top Ten\\" lists.  It's just a great story about a man, his family and his joys in life.  You'll get to see a great side of Mick's personality.<br />Also, you'll get to see \\"Mick Foley the Sports-Entertainer.\\"  The book continues to chronicle the ending part of his wrestling career picking up directly where \\"Have a Nice Day\\" finished.  It's a nice review of the 1999-2000 season of WWF wrestling with nice insight into the matches and feuds including how they were booked, etc.  Great read for WWF/wrestling fans.  Once again, the book also gave some great anecdotes of \\"the boys\\" (the other wrestlers) which was just a blast to read.<br />However, for myself personally, the real gem in this book is seeing \\"Mick Foley the Intellectual.\\"  Mick spends a very significant portion (I'd say a good 40%) of the book addressing controversial issues in the wrestling world:  backyard wrestling, violence on television, the parent's responsibility in proper parenting when it comes to filtering and being involved in children's viewing habits, drug use in the wrestling industry, the Owen Hart tragedy, the mainstream media's unfair portrayal of wrestling, The PTC.  Mick gives his thoughts on these issues in a BRILLIANT display of sound reasoning, logical arguments and plain old common sense.  His take on these issues is a must-read for anyone.  Mick goes so far to spend the last 100 pages of the book or so defending the WWF from the critical Indiana University content analysis study of WWF programming over the course of year and from the controversial allegations of the PTC.  His 100 page rebuttal to this was just brilliant.<br />Overall, the book was a pleasure to read.  Mick's writing style is very easy, almost like talking to a friend.  I read the book in two days on a weekend (all night Saturday, all day Sunday). It still contained the same great humor (sometimes cheesy and a bit sophomoric, which is GREAT to me), great wrestling stories, and also a great story about a family man.  Mick's love for his family shines through this book like a sun in Spring.  The most interesting part for me though was his take on the issues.  This is what really separates this from the first book that makes it a \\"must-read.\\"  Overall, it's a great look at the world through the eyes of a very interesting man.  A worthwhile read for anyone.<br />At the end of this 400+ page journey you'll tend to agree with Mick on two of the underlying themes that Mick weaves throughout the book.<br />1. The Real World IS Faker Than Wrestling<br />2. Foley IS Good.<br />Highest Recommendation Possible<br />ps:  Btw, in case if some readers of the first book were wondering, yes, the Al Snow jokes (along with the Mean Street Posse and Test) are in here too :)	2001-05-14
US	49128332	R16WVF193W6A1R	0072122668	801012875	A+ All-In-One Certification Exam Guide	Books	4	9	10	N	N	Great Study Tool, It Worked For Me :)	Michael Meyer's book was a great asset in my A+ certification goals.  I used it as an additional supplemental book to the PC Repair/A+ Certification course I took.  It gave me the needed edge and push to pass the exams.<br />Meyer's book is VERY easy to read and follow and is also extremely comprehensive, particularly for the Core objectives.  The diagrams and charts, both technical pictures, diagrams and cartoons illustrate his points very well.  The book is written in a way that explains extremely well how the technology develops.  Meyers makes a strong effort to make sure you understand the concepts which is very important for passing the exam.  He does more than &quot;prep you for the exam.&quot;  He preps you for a career as a technician.  I believe this book will be great for &quot;beginners.&quot;  It you are an experienced technician who just wants to get ready for the exam, this book may be more &quot;remedial&quot; for you.<br />After reading the book you come away with a great understanding of how computers work.  It may not be so much of a &quot;study&quot; book.  I think of it more as a &quot;foundation&quot; book.  After reading it though, I believe you come away with more than enough knowledge to pass the exam because the book gives you that strong foundation.<br />Whether or not this book is your &quot;one-stop&quot; resource for passing the exam is more a matter of the individual.  For myself, I took a prep class and used additional training software.  This book filled in many of the gaps for me and did n fact provide me with additional and stronger background into the technologies.<br />Summing it up, I can only see this book as a help for you in your quest to become A+ Certified.  It won't hurt you. It worked for me.<br />Good:  VERY COMPREHENSIVE AND EASY TO READ. Great for novices. Awesome prep tool for the Core in particular. The author shows a true mastery and understanding of the technologies and he passes it on well. Easy to follow charts and illustrations. Comes with CD-ROM with four 25 question practices tests with additional &quot;locked&quot; practice tests that can be bought for a fee of $79. FREEBIES!!!  The CD also comes with diagnostic software you can use on the job or at home.  Definite winner!!!!<br />So-so:  Practice tests are okay.  I used the free ones that come with the book.  Not bad, but you may find better practice testing software out there (like MCP Prep or NIIT) Coverage for the Windows/DOS portion was not as extensive as the Core, but still adequate.  He goes over EVERYTHING you need to know.<br />Bad:  If you are a seasoned tech this book may go into TOO MUCH depth for you.  You may consider a regular &quot;study guide&quot; like the Exam Cram book.<br />Note:  Keep in mind though, the A+ exam will be revised in Jan. 31, 2001, so this book will not be current.  However, given his track record, I would think his future updated editions will be just as comprehensive and effective.  Meyers is a winner.	2001-01-17

I read this book about a year ago and I am still impressed with Foley's life story to this day. The book had everything in it I could ask for:  action, adventure, romance and of course, humor.<br />It's a must-read for any fan of professional wrestling.  Mick takes you on a complete tour of the industry from his time in the U.S. independents, to his time in WCW, ECW, Japan and of course, the WWF.  He talks about many of the great wrestlers he's had an opportunity to work with over the past decade.  He's encountered just about EVERYONE. Being a life long fan of wrestling it was a great read for me to hear about his encounters with many of my favorites that he worked with.<br />Some highlights for me from the book in particular was:  his student film he made in school of his backyard wrestling league, his skipping out of class to attend a WWF show, when he recounts a trip he took to Africa in the beginning of his career, his adventures in Japan and of course his story of how he lost a part of his ear in Europe.<br />Even if you are not a wrestling fan, you will marvel and the many exploits that Mick Foley has encountered throughout his life. It's a great story about how a young man has had a chance to live out his dream and how one man &quot;beat the odds to become one of the best at what he does.&quot;  It was an awesome read.  Great story about a great guy.  It is unbelievable some of the things he's seen and done.<br />Highest recommendation.	2000-11-24

Coming from athletes, most of the dishes are very healthy so if you're looking for some healthy, yet tasty recipes, this book will do it for you.<br />A wide variety of dishes and flavors decorate this book since the WWF superstars come from various backgrounds.  There's a ton of chicken and steak recipes in here.  One of our personal favorites is Kane's Red Velvet Cake.<br />All in all a great investment, particularly if you're a wrestling fan.  Even if you're not, the easy to follow recipes and wide variety of recipes make this a keeper :)<br />Plusses:  - Stories of the wrestlers - Great pictures of the wrestlers - Appearances by many former WWF superstars for nostalgists. - Healthy recipes (wrestlers are fitness/health freaks - Simple, yet delicious sounding recipes - A wide selection of cooking styles and dishes<br />Minuses: - They are none.
