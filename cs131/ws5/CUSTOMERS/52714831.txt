Unfortunately, though it is entertaining, informative and well-written, it is not particularly original and just capitalizes on a multimillion dollar American obsession with weight. Unfortunately the book comes across also as slightly condescending and unrealistic. All Americans wish they had time to slow down and cook for themselves, for example, to sample some of the dishes for which Guiliano provides recipes. This isn't always possible. Overall, in fact, the book is a tribute to savoring life itself-and it will require a great deal of cultural retraining and reconditioning for the American mind to grasp or embrace this-to such an acute degree, in fact, that most Americans would neither submit nor have time to submit.  <br /> <br />While Guiliano does address head-on a number of simple and effective steps we should, ideally, all take to alter our lives and figures (drink copious amounts of water, stop beating ourselves up, always take the stairs or walk), she advocates many things that are unrealistic for many Americans. Some people cannot walk to their destinations (no matter how much they might like to); many people cannot afford fresh, seasonal vegetables and fruits from farmer's markets, even if they happen to have access to the farmer's market's Guiliano heralds and romanticizes in the book. Time is a valuable commodity for most Americans for whom budgetary constraints are often a major concern (and budgets are shrinking all the time).  <br /> <br />That is not to say that this book is without merit. That would be entirely unfair. In her defense, Guiliano is not necessarily directing this book to EVERY Americanwoman, but for women more like herself... successful, probably with some disposable income and the time to enjoy life (although she is a CEO of Clicquot and lives in America and is thus subject to some of the more rigorous challenges of American workaholic life, she is still French, and French people DO NOT have the same approach to work as Americans. I have personally lived with a number of French people, all of whom are intelligent and extremely hard workers when they are at work. Unlike most Americans, though, they are completely able to shut work out when they get home and insist on being able to go home and enjoy their time off, while Americans will just stay at the office, if not physically, then mentally). In any case, the average, middle class American woman might aspire to be thin like a French woman but would also need, if she were to follow Guiliano's advice, to aspire to live like a French woman, and that would require more than just reading this book. In fact, as I said, it would require a whole cultural re-education, starting with American women's toxic love-hate relationship with food.  <br /> <br />Some of Guiliano's points are quite valid-most diets are a form of \\"unsustainable extremism\\" that lead to \\"falling off the wagon\\" and into even worse circumstances. She therefore advocates \\"moderation\\" and a form of \\"indulge a bit now (but don't overdo it) and pay/sacrifice/compensate later\\", which is an idea neither French in origin nor unique or groundbreaking in any way or form. Any person who has struggled with weight has been to their family doctor and been told, \\"Well, you just need to adopt some moderation... and maybe some trade offs.\\" Any student of economics knows that there is an opportunity cost for everything. Eat the cake now, forego the bread later. Basically these simple principles are touted here as \\"French secrets\\" when these basic ideas are neither French nor secret. It is the triumph of marketing and good writing that frames them thisway. This underscores the point that there is no secret to French women's being thin except perhaps that they exert more self-control (and smoke!) A French woman may, however, enjoy a better relationship with food and sensuality than her American counterpart, who attaches virtue to going without and to abstinence and deprivation. One point on which Guiliano is clear: Stop equating food with guilt and sin. From a psychological standpoint the French are most definitely better off.  <br /> <br />Guiliano also point out with validity that gyms house pieces of equipment that look like weapons systems and seem as though they are built to maximize the Puritan American mentality and mantra of \\"no pain, no gain\\". Many every day activities, like climbing stairs, would yield the same health benefits, but Americans feel hell bent on imposing self-punishment. In fact it might be that Americans will not exercise at all unless they set aside that special time at the gym to do so.  <br /> <br />In the end, Guiliano pushes the concept of \\"balance\\", but all of the book, despite introducing personal anecdotes and sharing lovely vignettes about herself and her own experiences with weight gain and straddling two cultures, does not cover new ground, it just frames the same old story with a new cast of characters. It is a best-seller because it was marketed correctly and because it reads fluently and fluidly and quickly and gives a solid, common sense approach we should all already know and be practicing. (I cannot say I appreciate all the shameless plugs for Veuve Clicquot, either.)  <br />	2005-03-23

The method of switching point of view constantly, within chapters, is distracting rather than \\"cute\\" or \\"clever\\" or whatever it is supposed to be. Perhaps if this voice change were perpetrated chapter by chapter (although this is more conventional perhaps) there would be a great clarity and it would serve the reader better. Unfortunately as hard as this book tries to avoid stereotypes, it still offers a few stereotypes of its own. Maybe that is part of the point and an inevitability. We live in a world, after all, full of stereotypes. Characters here are, for the most part, quite well developed-\\"Blondie\\" and her Asian husband, their two adopted children and their own biological child (whom they had not expected) and the obligatory racist, closed and crazy \\"Chinese mother\\" who tries to orchestrate her son's life even from beyond the grave (and tear apart his mixed-marriage, of which she had never approved). The story moves along well and is quite readable, but there is a series of strange events that occur near the end that feel rushes and out of context (and out of character, perhaps). The twist at the end is something one might expect but it is enjoyable reading whether you guess at the twist or not.	2005-03-15

She manages gripping detail, driving the reader on to find out what's next, even when there is nothing really happening. The spellbinding nature of The Falls (Niagara Falls itself) is clearly illustrated, but what of the supposedly spellbinding nature of the main character of this novel, Ariah? I was not able to see what Dirk, the wealthy playboy who falls in love with and marries Ariah after she is widowed, sees in her. Maybe that is part of the overarching mystery. The story has a strange beginning-staged, unhappy marriage ended on the wedding night by suicide, which extends into an unconventional and fortuitous marriage for the so-called Widow Bride, Ariah. Despite the complexity and unstable nature of Ariah's character (and her belief that Dirk would somehow leave her sooner or later) I also don't see the logical progression of other aspects of her character... how did she change to become the woman she became? Was it wealth? Was it the attentions of Dirk, whom so many others had failed to capture? In any case, the grace and elegance of the story almost makes you forget that there is very little happening for long stretches of this book.	2005-03-15

It did not capture my imagination or attention. In the book, a gypsy, Juliette, who had once performed with a traveling carnival of sorts, is abandoned by the one man she ever loved, left to be imprisoned or worse (an old friend helps her escape). Juliette hides at an abbey, where she gives birth to a daughter, Fleur, and chooses to live her life, rearing Fleur, and taking on the sisterhood as Soeur Auguste. The abbey offers an idyllic life, cut off from reality-and all is well until the abbess dies. A new abbess, who is nothing more than a young girl, arrives at the abbey accompanied by a spiritual advisor, who turns out to be Juliette's former lover and fellow player, the Blackbird. Naturally he has come for some mysterious reason (later it turns out he wants revenge, and Juliette must unravel whatever his plans are in order to stop him). Juliette's first inclination is to run, but Blackbird is miles ahead of her, and has already abducted Juliette's daughter and sent her away in order to keep Juliette at the abbey and manipulate her. At times the story is exciting and fresh while in other parts the story wears on and gets on one's nerves. There are a variety of interesting characters within the abbey, but eventually Juliette herself seems to be grating on the nerves. The books wraps up too easily, smoothly, and in many cases, events were difficult to visualize.	2005-03-01

There is a sort of distance in the way it is written, perhaps intentional, that makes it difficult to care about or relate to the characters in this story, which makes for an underwhelming and unsatisfying effect. The main character in the story drifts, first from her professional liar father to a cousin, Bertram (who is barely related, if at all), and she is eventually pushed out even by this cousin and finds herself living with a strange family of refugees. Although there is a definite richness to these characters and a mystery to their story, it does not pull one in with enough force. One must admire the heroine, the orphaned Rose, while she drifts from one misfortunate situation to another, trying to be everything to everyone, in a sense, during her tenure with this family of foreigners (the Mitwissers). Distracting, though, is the presence of \\"James\\", a man of considerable wealth, who supports the Mitwisser family but treats them as playthings. James's story is told in chapters that intertwine with the rest of the book and don't really do much to add to the overall cohesive nature of the book. Eventually, Rose's position in the Mitwisser household is usurped by her wishy washy cousin, Bertram, who finds himself falling on hard times... and again he forces Rose out of her comfort zone. Maybe for Rose there is no comfort zone. In any case, I read this book and found it interesting throughout but never quite got the sense of what the point was. Heir to the Glimmering World is exceptionally well-written with deeply engaging characters but somehow too strange and impenetrable to make a real impact.	2005-03-01
US	52714831	R3UX4SKE9D46BF	0876092121	2609293	Economic Sanctions and American Diplomacy (Critical America)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	sanctions: not a fix-all	The unfortunate part about books such as these is that they are out of date before you read them, and as years go by, they lose much of their contemporary relevance. The book devotes entire chapters to economic sanctions in place against Yugoslavia, and the Yugoslavian sanctions are long over, while Libya (though sanctions against it lasted for a very long time) only recently emerged from the shadow of the sanctions placed against it. I would like to know, for example, what one can derive from the end of these sanctions (which were still in place when the book was written.) One would hope that a newer edition would address these matters. This book was not intended as a primer for interested spectators, though, it was intended as a study for more instructive purposes (to make recommendations to those in a position to employ sanctions).  <br /> <br />The book excels in illustrating the unpredictable and often volatile and even disastrous nature of imposing sanctions. So often, sanctions are used without any understanding of what they will do. Sanctions are an understudied, overused tool whose effects on intended targets/populations are not fully understood or appreciated. Sanctions will, of course, have different effects in different places, and employing them as a fix-all, blanket cure (choosing to do SOMETHING, rather than doing nothing or engaging in some kind of combat) will often lead to unfortunate, if unintended, side effects. Too often, sanctions have been employed as a \\"quick answer\\" to make it seem as though the US is doing something other than making idle threats, even if it is not actively engaged. Unfortunately this policy of hands-off engagement has done more harm than good because no time has been invested in investigating the outcome of the sanctions on a country-by-country basis. <br />	2005-02-23

I have realized in the course of reading his catalog of books that he seems more in his element with some subject matter than others. Because I so despised his European tour book, I expected to hate this book, too, but I read it anyway, perhaps just to fuel my desire for complaining. Bryson's style here is informative and obviously well-researched, informed heartily with his own anecdotes of trail life, arduous, rewarding and sometimes humorous.	2005-02-23

This book, though, looked at the subject, the history and landscape through a unique lens and was a rewarding read.  <br /> <br />It occurs to me that Bryson is more in his depth/element in Australia or America, while his observations on Europe often read like deeply biased American obtuseness and insensitivity. Bryson's wit here, in Australia, and his own seemingly inexhaustible curiosity and apt descriptions of Australia as an amazing, far off, awe-inspiring land we in the rest of the world never see, hear of, or think about are all endearing.  <br /> <br />Having never traveled to Australia, I am more tempted to do so after reading this book. To illustrate how little the rest of the world knows-I point out that in all my own travels/experiences, I have been to New Zealand but am always asked when I get back, \\"How was Australia?\\" as if the two countries are one and the same.  <br />	2005-02-23

An Amateur Marriage is a tale spanning several decades, jumping forward in time throughout the book, from the beginning, with volatile young lovers one cannot discourage from making the biggest mistake of their lives (marrying each other) to the trials of their family life and marital woes, to the regrets and difficulties inherent in the choices they have made. The story is nothing groundbreaking; unhappy marriage that people stick with because they have invested too much and can justify all the problems one way or another and make excuses for the misery in which they live. The strength of the book in this case, in fact what differentiates it from every other book that might handle the subject matter less adeptly, is the writer's ability to make the reader connect with the characters, particularly the two main characters. The reader feels each of their wounds, doubts and can understand the devotion to each other despite the volatile and argumentive nature of their long relationship. The greatest skill Tyler employs is being able to give each character a level of humanity that enables the reader to see each person's point of view/perspective. It is not, therefore, possible to blame or judge either of the main characters, but the reader is able to see each of the characters through the other's eyes. When the family reunites at the end, the story takes a bittersweet, reflective tone, which I found rather sad and fitting.	2005-02-23

The \\"law\\" empowers the UN or other bodies to \\"do a study\\" on complaints of non-compliance or violations. The creation of so many of these tools has been so politicized as to make many functions of the laws and treaties virtually useless and sometimes, apparently, contradictory (or at least open to debate and interpretation). What good is a \\"thorough study\\"? With no teeth, no authority and a backdrop of outside interfering factors (economic and political especially), these \\"norms\\" might be interpreted as existing in name only. In a section on gross violations of human rights and the UN Charter, one reads, \\"The required magnitude of the concept of `massive' or `gross' violations may also gradually require a lower threshold of severity as the international community becomes less tolerant of what is lawful behavior under the Charter. Viewed in this light, the human rights provisions of the Charter are `elastic clauses' whose expansion is tied to the evolving standards of international legality and decency.\\"  <br /> <br />It is interesting to note that there are so many different systems for presumably one basic set of human rights and principles, though again this makes sense because each nation (politicized again) has its own principles and interpretations of what is a \\"right\\". For example, European countries refuse to extradite criminals to the United States if a criminal will face the death penalty. I would also not have imagined the very extensive provisions of the African Charter on Human Rights. It differs markedly from European and American conventions and is more extensive-proclaiming not only rights but also duties. Interestingly but perhaps not as surprisingly it provides the ability for States Parties to restrict and limit the rights it proclaims at will/liberally.  <br /> <br />Overall this is an excellent overview and convenient presentation on the subject matter, with an extensive array of information and a source for finding more in-depth information for further reading/study/examination. <br />	2005-02-23
US	52714831	R2VCF2ODD5XAPB	0375421246	547348939	Victorine: A Novel	Books	2	2	7	N	N	not believable or authentic	Not being a fan of contemporary, popular fiction, this is not a book I would normally have selected. It was one among many I received, so I read it not really knowing what to expect. Unfortunately the most noticeable aspect of the book was that it was pieced together in a distracting way. Although by the end one is used to it, the timeline of the story jumps around excessively to the point that it is not simple to follow at what point the characters do various things, making it too easy to forget what is going on. Despite being based very loosely on actual events (the author is imagining what perhaps transpired in her great-grandmother's life), and though readable and somewhat entertaining, the book does not make a particular \\"impression\\" or connection. The dubious heroine of the novel, Victorine, does not make choices that make sense to me as a reader, or at least the reasoning behind her choices (whether logical or not) is not clear. Victorine's choice to leave her husband and two children behind to pursue adventure and love in Indochina does not seem remarkably agonizing, painful or difficult. Although there are passages hinting at her ambivalence, the book does not delve into Victorine's mind or feelings at a level that can persuade the reader to understand what she has chosen for herself. It is never entirely clear that her desire for adventure and love was so strong that it would propel her to make a reckless choice like leaving her family behind. Nor was it entirely clear that she had any great love for the two children she abandoned, although she returned to them eventually. Somehow, her choices and feelings seemed hollow and artificial in a way that, for example, Anna Karenina's did not (Anna Karenina of course being literature's greatest unfaithful wife and mother). The most truthful aspect of this book, in my estimation, is the idiocy of French bureaucracy, as the government first offers Victorine's lover Antoine a promotion while at the same time informing him that they cannot tender a renewal of his employment contract.	2005-02-23

I laugh that this book is called \\"African Diary\\", given that Kenya is a small part of Africa in total. This is the way of the western world though... \\"Africa\\" is just lumped together as if there is such a thing as \\"African culture\\" rather than hundreds of different cultures on this misunderstood continent.  <br /> <br />I happened to read this small tome at the same time as I was reading Michael Moore's rather inflammatory prose, and I found that the books went well together. In one book Moore points out the basic human right of clean water and sanitary living conditions, while Bryson travels through Kenya astounded by the sheer lack or at least rarity of these things. Both Bryson and Moore discuss how America consumes so many of the world's resources and wonders why the world hates the US. Bryson provides vivid detail, \\"Every time you flush a toilet (in the West) you use more water than the average person in the developing world has for all purposes in a day-cooking, cleaning, drinking, everything.\\" Bryson learns this startling fact as he wanders through one of Nairobi's slums, having traveled to Kenya on behalf of the charity, CARE.  <br /> <br />A theme of hopelessness pervades-parents in Kenya will do anything-any kind of suffering-in order for their children to get an education but then the children, having reached a certain level of education, cannot afford higher education anyway.  <br /> <br />I was thankful here for Bryson's brevity, his \\"sense of humor\\" in previous/other books is not necessarily for everyone (I recognize that I am in the minority in not much enjoying his humor), and he kept his observations more anthropological than comedic here, and that lent a greater sense of urgency and validity to the subject matter at hand.  <br />	2005-02-23

Instead it came to me, and in the stagnant time typical of February in Iceland, I read this book eagerly. Spanning a couple of years in the tail end of the 1970s to the early 1980s, Adam Langer ambitiously (but seemingly effortlessly) weaves together a seamless story, or collection of intersecting stories, brought together flawlessly by vivid characters. Langer proves immediately his expertise at bringing out the humanity in his characters, involving the reader intimately with the lives, triumphs, disappointments and doubts of the characters. The reader finds him/herself curious about the futures of the characters, wanting to know the outcome of their decisions, not wanting the story to end, even as it eventually does. The strength of this book lies in the truly individual, exact and unique nature of each character. Each comes to life on the page, urgently relatable, immediately identifiable... people we as readers have known in our lives or reflections of ourselves. It is a rare achievement to personify so many different characters on so many different levels and imbue them with the kind of humanity Langer has given them. I would like to say that I had a favorite character but each was so well-formed and well-written that even the characters I did not particularly like (those most flawed, for example) were certainly tangible. The realism in the book made it impossible to choose one character or plotline that was more gripping than another. I would wholeheartedly recommend this book for its remarkably realistic characters and for its faithful rendering of the time period.	2005-02-23

The inner workings of a woman's mind after she has been torn from her daily life, in which she had naively believed the war in the former Yugoslavia would not touch her or her village. The vivid detail of her camp experience, the alienation, the isolation, the feeling of losing what little trust you had in others (selfishness being the first \\"virtue\\" of being confined to the camp) is striking. The book begins with the description of the woman, S., giving birth to a baby who was a product of her rape in the camps. She does not want to see or touch the baby for fear she will then feel responsible for it. The book then goes back in time to describe how S. came to this point, to Stockholm, Sweden, where she gives birth.  <br /> <br />The book is difficult to read straight through, many passages making me feel physically ill and disturbed. A passage about the tortures women endured in the camp at the hands of their captors was particularly difficult to read (cigarette burns on their skin, soldiers carving symbols into the women's skin, and various other humiliating and painful abuses).  <br />	2004-11-19
US	52714831	RLB55GEGWAHA2	071780609X	334622489	Alexandra Kollontai: Selected Articles and Speeches	Books	4	4	4	N	N	upon further analysis	Whatever others may say or think, Alexandra Kollontai is still relevant. Perhaps some of her ideas on women's rights and fundamental equality of the sexes were not fleshed out with empirical research as much as they could have been. Her thoughts on family life and sex and child rearing were also revolutionary for the time in which she wrote about them, but again, she did not have the background to dig deeply into and analyze these issues as well as could be done (her knowledge of sociology and psychology being limited, for example). Kollontai did, though, raise controversial issues, and what makes them relevant today is that most of the issues she discussed in the early part of the 20th century are still just as relevant. The landscape has changed, the framework in which we deal with the issues she addressed is different, but there are still fundamental economic inequalities everywhere. Many issues are still daily concerns throughout the world. The part that is not as relevant, of course, is that Kollontai fervently believed that communism would eradicate these inequalities and sex/relationship/family problems. Because she perhaps naively believed so strongly in this system she did not examine reality as critically as she could have (not to mention that if she had tried to do so, she would have met opposition from within the Soviet government.)  <br /> <br />Kollontai's views on gender and gender equality were of interest, but because the \\"class struggle\\" was more important to her (and indeed she believed the abolishment of \\"class\\" would free women from the boundaries imposed on them in society, she neglected some important underlying issues about feminism, women and society. She does, however, make it clear that women (as well as all people) need to be actively engaged in the politics of their country. The importance of this issue is still felt today, as many people turn against political involvement, feeling it is hopeless. If nothing else, people need to be informed. How, indeed, are women to have equal representation if they don't get involved, she argued? The same is true today, although it applies to all citizens of a democratic society. In the United States today, civil rights, for example, are violated freely by institutions \\"in the name of security\\", but this is diversionary and keeps people from really questioning what is happening in their society.  <br /> <br />On a related matter, an issue Kollontai addressed with particularly fervent passion is World War I: is in fact the issue of nations lying to their people to garner support for unjust wars ethical or acceptable? Could that be irrelevant? No, in fact, reading Kollontai's words today (the book is largely a collection of her speeches), the passion and reason with which she argued against the war could just as well have been a modern speech about the current situation in Iraq. She writes (keep in mind this is all in translation), \\"People talk of the `right of each people to self-defence'. Each state naturally tries to present itself as having begun the war in order to preserve and defend its culture, and not in order to fill the purses of the capitalists.\\" (We could perhaps substitute \\"preserve and defend its culture\\" to \\"preserve and defend `democracy' everywhere\\" to imitate what might be said in present day. Meanwhile, the real reasons are capitalist ones.)  <br /> <br />\\"Culture! Yes, culture is indeed man's most precious possession. But is it not war that threatens the very existence of culture? Is it not because of war that magnificent old forests are ruthlessly destroyed? Is it not war that destroys the best historical monuments and works of art? Finally, are there any `cultural values' which are worth the cost of hundreds of thousands, even millions, of human lives?\\" <br /> <br />\\"Ask any soldier, be he Russian or German, what were they fighting for? For what did they shed the blood of their brothers, the workers and peasants of their neighboring country?For what did they cripple people? They will not tell you, they will not answer, because they themselves do not really know.\\"  <br /> <br />Kollontai points out the hypocrisies that lie at the heart of most wars, and her passion is evident. It is abundantly clear how she rose to such esteem in the Communist party and why she was so well respected as someone who could rouse the passions of the people. At the same time, her focus, so admired by her peers, was the same focus and passion that made her unable to form more sophisticated analyses and effect real change. Nevertheless, her ideas remain highly relevant and deserve further exploration from a modern audience. For all her ideas lacked, the passion with which she delivered her ideas, is ardent and even so apparent it virtually jumps off the pages. <br />	2004-11-19

To me at the time, many years ago, the book was unusual in its approach to human relationships. However, I did not fully appreciate the complexities of what Kollontai wrote (either in the relatively simple form of her fiction-this book-or in some of her more \\"scholarly\\" writings (although I would never refer to her as \\"scholarly\\"). The issues highlighted in this collection bear a strong relevance to modern life, as women make choices between career and family/love and sometimes choose to balance both. A theme running through most of Kollontai's public speaking and writing is the idea that everything comes back to a question of economics. Relationships and families, aside from any emotional ties, are economically driven. The fabric of different societies unravels because of economic tensions and problems (and the official blame is often directed at ethnic problems, as in the former Yugoslavia. Economics and the condition of \\"having versus not having\\" led to the initial disintegration. Economics can also, as Kollontai illustrates, lead people together or break them apart. When economics is no longer a factor-as she envisioned would be the case in a proletarian-led society-the root of relationships, feelings and sexuality can be explored.) <br /> <br />Another overarching theme Kollontai addresses on all levels is the contradictory nature of life itself, that is the contradiction between theory and practice. If one were to read Worker Bees BEFORE reading Kollontai's more theoretical work, one could easily dismiss Worker Bees as a \\"fluff\\" piece of fiction, but the work does manage to touch upon so many of the contradictions Kollontai loved to expose and consider.  <br /> <br />What is Kollontai's voice in this book? Who is she? As a woman, idealist, ideological-disappointed by what the USSR became. She survived the purges, but maybe only because she quickly learned to separate reality from ideology. She spent most of Stalin's \\"reign\\" outside of Russia, serving in the role of ambassador. Some perceive her appointment to these diplomatic offices as a surge forward for women in society and politics, while many others see her ambassadorial posts as pseudo-punishment/exile. She barely had the chance to use what was previously an active and passionate voice to express her disappointment and criticism at how the revolution had fallen into the hands of a bureaucratic party (power of the few) and stolen from the hands of the workers/masses (power of the many). The failure to fulfill the original dream of the revolution indeed could have informed some of these writings.  <br /> <br />Kollontai's drive to make everything into a class struggle only limited her \\"vision\\". She firmly believed that the elimination of class would eradicate gender inequalities. Was this blind dedication to the party and the revolution and class struggle detrimental to some of her more important but sadly undeveloped and understudied ideas on family, sexuality and uniquely female issues? The conflict between the party/revolution and feminism may have hindered her thinking and writing on the subject and created a blinder against some of the more topical and pertinent realities she faced. Her ideas touch on difficult matters but don't resolve or even probe them: in these (Kollontai's) times, what is \\"Communist morality\\"? Where are the boundaries of intimacy/morality/sexual freedoms? In keeping with gender inequality, there is always the unresolved matter of double standards for the behavior of men and women. Even individuals who claim to have transcended old moral standards continue to judge using these outdated and unfair practices. <br /> <br />Kollontai does, in Worker Bees, illustrate the contradictions between real, daily life problems versus ideological life. The workers did not have the basic necessities while the splendor in which the main character's (Vasya) husband Vladimir was living was not remotely in line with Communist ideology. His lavish materialism, for him, seemed a natural extension of his position in society, and unfortunately illustrates that, despite grand efforts, class is almost an intrinsic \\"value\\". People may achieve greater things and it almost follows that a sense of entitlement and privilege follows the greater \\"position\\". Vladimir struggles with his relationship to the party. For as committed to its ideals as he originally seemed, he finds that living with the realities that accompany the ideology is much more difficult and is led more and more into bourgeois desire and a need for \\"ownership\\". Indeed Vladimir treats his wife, Vasya, as he treats the party-opportunistically. He needs her and/or the party only in a crisis and when he finds himself in trouble. He can only \\"love\\" Vasya as he knew her when he met her... fierce, strong, independent... but he still tries to press her down, criticize her and limit her when she does not conform to the \\"bourgeois ideals\\" that are now the basis for his lifestyle. Another contrast between reality and ideology and the difficulty of adopting every aspect of a \\"revolution\\" (naturally your former way of thinking still exists) is Vasya's approach to nature. She witnesses the beauty of nature around her and calls the parts of nature \\"God's creatures\\", swiftly reproaching herself since the party is officially atheist.  <br /> <br />Although the story drones on redundantly lamenting love and jealousy, the issue of \\"double standards\\" (mentioned earlier) is an interesting one. Vladimir's self-serving, selfish behavior-always wanting to have everything and never making real choices-allows him a certain callousness. He can act as though he respects his wife (interestingly she is his common-law wife) and the fact that she had been a \\"sexually liberated woman\\" before he met her, but when he is pressed into a corner (being confronted, for example, by the fact that he has been keeping a mistress about whom Vasya knew nothing), he turns the tables and throws Vasya's \\"lack of virtue\\" in her face. Despite claiming to live in this \\"free and liberated\\" manner, Vasya still feels an enormous amount of guilt for her lack of \\"virginity\\", and Vladimir exerts a hold over Vasya by continually pointing out Vasya's impurity.  <br /> <br />Vladimir though cannot truly be seen as a Communist. He sets different standards for the women in his life. His concubine, Nina, is a \\"lady\\" by bourgeois standards and therefore cannot work in a factory, unlike his proletarian wife. Although Vladimir's application of this double standard is more obvious, creating different standards for different women and generally conforming to \\"bourgeois society standards\\", less obvious is the divisive nature of women applying double standards to other women. Communist women are supposedly \\"free and liberated\\" but for \\"ladies\\" like Nina, their virtue is linked to their purity. Even the liberated Vasya, who are held up to this unjust \\"purity standard\\", criticize the \\"loose morals\\" of someone like Nina because she perceives that Nina uses her beauty and other favors for material gain. This may or may not be the case, but the snap judgment Vasya comes to is the same kind of snap judgment this double standard for men and women's behavior rests on and which Vasya herself, if she were outside the situation, would condemn. The irony of the situation is that Vasya cannot see the reality of her own situation clearly until she sees it mirrored in the situation of another. Finally she is able to see her own situation from all sides and from the point of view of an outsider.  <br /> <br />In the short story \\"Generations\\", also included in this volume, other issues are raised... generational issues. Supposedly Kollontai wants to argue that there are fewer moral contradictions in people over the years by illustrating the stories of three generations of women. There is a generational progress toward the ideal, free Communist society. However, she does well in pointing out the pitfalls of this progress and generational understanding fails to bridge the gaps. As the contradictions lessen, it appears also that people's emotions and understanding of each other also erode (this seems to be a point that is made although Kollontai most likely did not intend it). Some of the contradictions in the story force the reader to ask questions like: can a person really have it both ways? (One character loves two men and wants to give up neither.) Does sharing something intimate with someone rob a third person of the intimacy s/he feels with one of the participants? (A woman in the story has a common-law husband who begins an affair with her daughter from a previous marriage. They do not hide this affair and in fact believe the woman should be happy they have taken such an interest in one another. The woman feels betrayed, as though her daughter sharing intimate relations with the step-father is somehow diminishing his feeling for the woman. In a sense the woman feels a form of shame as well because her own Marxist beliefs would not find it proper to stake ownership on someone's soul. Indeed: is monogamy a form of bourgeois oppression?) Finally, one wonders: have you really made a choice or decision if you have constant doubts and anxieties? If you have not really chosen but rather vacillate? The women in \\"Generations\\" struggle with these issues much as women in today's society continue to struggle with some of the \\"moral issues\\" prescribed by human relationships in a sociological context.  <br />	2004-11-18

Lately as I have been rereading texts by such writers and thinkers as Alexandra Kollontai, Rosa Luxemburg and later analysis of their thinking by Raya Dunayevskaya, I ask myself the same question people ask me, perplexed as they see that I am reading something so \\"outdated\\" about a system that was \\"proven wrong\\": is this information relevant today, aside from the historical perspective gained from it? Yes, I argue that it is very relevant. It proves, if nothing else, that issues, particularly for women, that were issues 100 years ago are still issues today. Many societies have made little or no social progress, and some have arguably moved backwards.  <br /> <br />This particular book, with analysis from Alix Holt, is quite useful and telling because Holt provides a context and an even-handed critique of Kollontai's writing. Kollontai has been dismissed by many as an overly idealistic thinker, and her thoughts on family and sexuality have earned Kollontai an undeserved reputation as someone who advocated sexual promiscuity and irresponsibility as well as \\"moral decay\\". Naturally these analyses are overly simplistic; Kollontai was a revolutionary (not just in the traditional sense, having participated actively in the Russian Revolution and serving as Lenin's only female commissar, but also a revolutionary on social norms and sociology). Kollontai questioned the role of family in society and predicted that \\"family\\" as the nuclear unit would cease to exist (under socialism/Communism, in her evaluation) because family is an economic/need-based construct. The erosion of the family unit as economic unit would change the dynamics between men and women and would create the need for in depth evaluation of sexuality and the basis for relationships. Kollontai asked many questions on this topic in earnest, which were integral questions to the development of Soviet society (beset by major problems as it was) yet as time went on, her ideas were marginalized and even demonized. Asthe Soviet propaganda machine grew (mostly under Stalin), Kollontai no longer had a voice. Suddenly these ideas, in the words of Alix Holt, \\"became more and more preposterous and the party quite sensibly put its foot down. In actual fact, things were quite otherwise, for her ideas changed very little. It was the attitudes of men and women both inside and outside the party that were changing and giving rise to objections against what had previously been accepted without question.\\" Kollontai watched the Revolution for which she had fought (and in the name of which she had been blind and naive to many realities) be co-opted by the Stalin personality cult and excessive bureaucracy. It is evident that Kollontai was a personality more than a philosopher. She had beliefs and ideas, but she, as Holt points out in later analysis, failed to form her observations into real and meaningful analysis. Many of her most striking ideas are barely developed. Kollontai objected to being linked with a women's movement or a feminist movement in her time because she felt that women's rights would be part and parcel of any successful proletarian revolution, and that equality would be achieved automatically. This is part of Kollontai's short-sightedness, faithfully documented in this book and analyzed by Holt. Kollontai had valuable ideas she never researched or explored fully; she recognized intrinsic problems within society (particularly those pertaining to women and children), but she blindly accepted that the revolution and the Soviet government would take care of all these things. By the time she realized that the \\"dream\\" was slipping away, it was too late. Stalin had the power to silence her one way or another (she is one of the few to survive the purges, although it can be argued that she was sidelined effectively by being sent as Soviet ambassador to Norway, Mexico, etc.) <br /> <br />This book coupled with other readings about or by Kollontai give a vivid picture of Russia duringand after the revolution and the hopes many people shared for building a worker's society. The book also illustrates, as I stated, how the same concerns that Kollontai and colleagues faced in forming a new government still plague society today. Although strides have been made in \\"granting\\" women more equality, they are still not \\"equal\\" in many regards. Kollontai, who was so ahead of her time, gives modern women pause to consider that if serious feminist and equality matters are STILL problematic now, almost 100 years after Kollontai was fighting for the equality of all people, we have not really \\"blazed the trail\\" to women's rights. At the same time, though, it is not just society \\"holding women back\\" but also the attitudes of many women themselves. (For example, Bill Maher said that when women want to elect a woman to the US presidency, they will. They have the majority. It is not society necessarily that isn't ready; perhaps it's women themselves.) Unfortunately Kollontai faced an uphill battle educating people as to their individual rights and responsibilities... we still face this issue now. Relevant? Absolutely so.	2004-11-06
US	52714831	RLLOQ71H0MY6U	0375411690	877497311	Sputnik Sweetheart	Books	3	7	8	N	N	�You�re a lot weirder than you look.�	Don't get me wrong - I love Haruki Murakami. I have noticed, however, in reading his works, that the style and tone and themes are often too much alike, and this grows slightly tiresome after a while. How many books can a person write about people disappearing without a trace? In short, the narrator of Sputnik Sweetheart, a schoolteacher, is in love with a strange girl called Sumire who only desire to be a writer. Sumire realizes early on that she has fallen in love with a sophisticated older businesswoman, Miu. Miu gives Sumire a job, and that is where the changes and complications ensue. <br />Interesting ideas in this book include Murakami's brief exploration of the idea of being \\"attentive\\". When the main character/narrator had an affair with an older woman earlier in his life, he was \\"instructed\\" in how to go about being with a woman when the woman used the analogy of being a good driver versus an attentive driver. The woman insists that being a good driver does not matter as long as the driver is \\"attentive\\" and alert. The narrator began to see the connection to his sexual being... being alert and attentive to the things around him. \\"Not prejudging things, listening to what's going on, keeping your ears, heart and mind open.\\" <br />Another interesting idea is the idea of your existence being split into two parts. One of the main characters, Miu, felt herself split in half one night... one side had all her sexual desire, her youth. The part the character in the book was left with was a woman with no sexual desire, who held everyone at arm's length and whose hair had turned white overnight. The narrator explores the idea of what is on \\"the other side\\"... can people cross over between these two existences? <br />Finally, Murakami writes, \\"So that's how we live our lives. No matter how deep and fatal the loss, no matter how important the thing that's stolen from us-that's snatched right out of our hands-even if we are left completely changed, with only the outer layer of skin from before, we continue to play out our lives this way, in silence. We draw ever nearer to the end of our allotted span of time, bidding it farewell as it trails off behind. Repeating, often, adroitly, the endless deeds of the everyday. Leaving behind a feeling of immeasurable emptiness.\\" <br />I have given these ideas a great deal of thought. No matter the impression we have left nor how intense the experiences we shared with someone, when circumstances change, you lives are separate and you go on like nothing has happened. This is a theme that re-emerges in life multiple times.	2004-07-11

It is concise in its ability to convey just what you need to know, and familiar in that you can, given a somewhat cynical frame of mind like mine, recognize some of your own thought processes unfolding in the narrative. <br />This collection of short stories is true to the term \\"short stories\\"... several stories are mere paragraph-long vignettes, but nevertheless worthwhile. <br />Of particular note are specific stories: \\"Isaac\\", \\"The Taste of Blood\\" and \\"Scratches on the Back\\". <br />In \\"Isaac\\", he tries to escape from a moving train, but manages to escape only as the train is slowing. An officer apprehends Isaac, asking him if he was planning to leave them. Isaac mutters, \\"Animals,\\" about the officers, to which the officer replies, \\"I may be an animal, but this animal is philosophical. If you can't change the fate of the majority, you have to share it.\\" The story, in its brevity, conveys the sense of courage Isaac felt, not believing the sheep-like nature of those accompanying him in the train car (presumably riding toward their deaths). How, he wonders, can these people not fight against this fate? Isaac displays courage, but the story illustrates how even the most courageous of acts are often met with futility. <br />\\"The Taste of Blood\\" is written in an unusual way, leaving the reader with an ominous feeling, as though something could go terribly wrong at any time. <br />In \\"Scratches on the Back\\" the narrator is sarcastic, set in his ways, but despite being set in his ways, does not fight against the tide of change when something alters his life. He goes through life in a laissez-faire sort of manner, but he finds that by doing nothing the course of his daily life changes, even though he has done nothing to alter it. Although the direction of the story and plotline were not particularly engaging to me, I was fond of the narration provided by the \\"protagonist\\"of the story. In the beginning of the story, he relates the tale of throwing a party for someone, only to find that the guest annoyed him and were careless enough with their drinks as to stain his rug, \\"All I could figure was that I had invited the wrong people to the party last night. People who didn't appreciate hand-woven rugs made of mountain-goat hair. People who let wine splash over the rims of their glasses while they went on about their adventures and waving their hands in the air. Some adventures. People obviously think that they can turn everything nothing into something if they pump it up enough. And this usually requires a lot of gesticulations.\\" <br />The best story in the collection is \\"Kyoto\\", which chronicles an encounter between an American tea-ceremony teacher in Kyoto and three American pupils. One of these pupils is a stereotypical \\"ugly American\\" abroad. He is irritated when he learns he cannot acquire all the knowledge and skills needed to drink tea in the traditional Japanese way in just a few days, and as a result attempts to use cold, hard (though simple, direct, blunt and crass) logic to make a point. <br />The narrator is one of the three pupils, an onlooker really to the unfolding dialogue between Jay, the teacher, who claims to be at one with all of nature when engaged in the complex art of drinking tea, and Sam, the ugly American who does not grasp the complexity and time-consuming nature of mastering tea nor its spiritual or theoretical foundations. Sam's \\"logic\\" is to challenge Jay's assertion that he is in fact \\"at one\\" with nature. \\"So that you form a harmonious whole with all living beings...; ... and that nothing natural is alien to you, that nothing living disgusts you.\\" Sam dares Jay to eat a live caterpillar to prove this \\"oneness\\" with nature. <br />Up to this point, Jay seemed to be the one in control of the conversation. Sam was too crass and outrageous to seem anything more than an annoyance to Jay. But Jay was tempted bythe bet. Sam offered Jay a considerable sum of money if he could indeed eat the caterpillar. On the other hand, if Jay could not eat the caterpillar, Jay would have to return to the United States with Sam and open a tea school there. <br />The story comes alive and, despite being without overt action, is riveting because you wonder if Jay will be tempted enough by some lingering greed/material need (which he claims to have rescinded in becoming one with nature). You wonder if Jay will succeed in eating the caterpillar. Will Sam have to pay up? <br />Jay, after eating the caterpillar, becomes violently ill. He vomits the whole caterpillar, still intact, and thereby loses the bet. Jay is forced to return to America and figures he probably belongs there because his decade of tea training has obviously done him little good if he was tempted by money. Sam, self-satisfied, says, \\"What is Japan nowadays but a poor-quality instant copy of America? What else are all these McDonalds, all these slot machine halls, all these copied metropolitan streets, all this neon and metal?\\"<br />\\"This,\\" said Jay, \\"is Japan without tea.\\"	2004-04-19

I was impressed by the stunning, detailed descriptions of landscapes, people (physically and mentally), and I appreciated the detailed way the story unfolded. Comparing the book to the film (which is always a bad idea), I can say that I enjoyed both. The book offers eloquent descriptions of characters, so you understand them with greater depth. Particularly important are the elegant portrayals of Kabuo, Hatsue, and Ishmael, and the narrative relies on flashback sequences to convey the characters' relationships to each other and to reveal the history of why each character is how he or she is. In the film, for example, Ishmael's bitterness is not fully developed, and Kabuo's character is not fleshed out well either. It was, for example, impossible for the movie to convey Kabuo's feelings as expressed in the book, e.g. \\"He had meant to project to the jurors his innocence, he's wanted them to see that his spirit was haunted,\\" and, \\"It had seemed to Kabuo that his detachment from this world was somehow self-explanatory.\\" Although the manner in which both Kabuo and Ishmael had been affected by the war was touched on in the film, the book delved deeply into these matters. The book helps bring the scenery and the people to life far more than the movie \\"incarnation\\" possibly could. That much is to be expected.	2004-04-19

To me it also seems ungovernable. And it also seems to me, and possibly I exaggerate, that because a metaphor for the deeper chaos of the world can be sensed here, all are washing their hands of it.\\" (Drago Jancar's \\"Memories of Yugoslavia\\", in this volume). Given this ungovernable union, as Jancar described, it is easy to see how Slovenia could have been lost in the mess of Yugoslavia's messy break-up. Though Slovenia was the instigator of the break-up, its war lasted only ten days, and Slovenia was virtually free of the warfare and chaos that ensued when Yugoslavia descended into the turmoil of breaking apart. <br />Although Zawacki's compilation of works does lack certain things (and the foreword points this out), such as women writers and a vast selection of good translations from the original Slovenian, overall this is a good collection of/introduction to a variety of Slovene writers as well as a varied overview of different genres (essays, short stories, poetry). Among the best of what is offered here include Drago Jancar's \\"Memories of Yugoslavia\\", the excerpt of \\"Pilgrim Among the Shadows\\" by Boris Pahor, who manages to strip down ethical matters to the basest considerations. <br />Beyond this, the poetry in the collection gives only a taste of some of the rich imagery and even in some cases subtle but clear national pride that resides within much of Slovenian literature. I recommend Edvard Kocbek (\\"The Lippizaners\\", \\"Song About Man\\"), Dane Zajc (\\"You are Not\\"), Tomaz Salamun (\\"I and Thou\\"), Milan Dekleva (\\"The Origin of Language\\"), Boris A. Novak (\\"Interior\\" and \\"Exile\\") and Maja Haderlap (\\"Nothing Remains\\"). <br />Much can be said of the Slovenes and their resilience, maintaining a national language, culture and identity despite being somewhat obscured by its own associations. First it was obscured by its Austro-Hungarian ties and later by its part in the Yugoslavian union. Indeed, though it is perhaps not the best example, Slovenia is to many a small, unseen and misunderstood place. In fact, some national leaders have visited Slovenia, claiming they were visiting Slovakia! I cannot count the times I have had to explain in detail where Slovenia is. <br />Nevertheless, this book, though not perfect nor exhaustive, is an excellent introduction to a rich literary culture.	2004-01-24

He begins each chapter with a purposeful repetition, reminding us that he has been hard at work for 35 years, and this is his whole life. Although the book meanders without much plot, the metaphors put to work here are things of beauty, despite the fact that we are reading it in translation. \\"...When I read, I don't really read; I pop a beautiful sentence in my mouth and suck at it like a fruit drop...\\" The juxtaposition of art rotting among garbage is clear and prevalent throughout the book.<br />Hrabal's narrator spins brief vignettes about events in his life, \\"portrait of the artist as an old mushroom face\\", always coming back to the idea of heaven. \\"Neither the heavens are humane nor is life above or below-- or within me.\\" Or, \\"The heavens are not humane, but I'd forgotten compassion and love.\\" Or better still, as the narrator begins to feel the hopeless feeling of technology and progress encroaching on his insular world, as books were destroyed vigorously, indifferently, thoughtlessly, \\"The heavens may be far from humane, but I'd had about all I could take.\\" The new automated hydraulic wastepaper compactors had filled him with a shock; there was nothing human left in their work. No one stopped to savor the content of the waste. He realized it was the death knell not only for smaller compactors but to his way of life. <br />He describes how he received his education from these books unwittingly over the 35 years he has worked in this job, committing what he calls \\"crimes against books\\". But it was in this way that he came to see the beauty of destruction.<br />\\"How much more beautiful it must have been in the days when the only place a thought could make its mark was the human brain and anybody wanting to squelch ideas had to compacthuman heads, but even that wouldn't have helped because real thoughts come from outside and travel with us like the noodle soup we take to work; in other words, INQUISITORS BURN BOOKS IN VAIN.

As an entire society struggles to be recognised as an independent entity under threat of Russian tanks and violence, the characters seek individuality in their own ways. Indeed, this individuality is personified by the way each character perceives and feels love. <BR>The story of Tomas and Tereza, Sabina and Franz, as people, is compelling and beautiful (and tragic) enough. Kunderas writing style and rich, philosophical prose is all the more rewarding. It took me years to finally sit down and read this book, and I regret all the wasted time. The book is far more rewarding than the film of the same name because the prose is so deep and worthwhile. The film, too, is good because Lena Olin and Juliette Binoche are luminous as always. Daniel Day Lewis plays Tomas well because his real persona seems to fit that of Tomas so perfectly. <BR>Tomas is a doctor in Prague and happens to meet the woman who will be his wife, Tereza, when he travels out of town for some sort of conference. They meet by a number of chance occurrences, and the novel Anna Karenina is instrumental in bringing them together. Early in the novel that Tereza clutched under her arm when she went to visit Tomas, Anna meets Vronsky in curious circumstances: they are at the railway station when someone is run over by a train. At the end of the novel, Anna throws herself under a train. This symmetrical compositionthe same motif appears at the beginning and at the endmay seem quite novelistic to you, and I am willing to agree, but only on the condition that you refrain from reading such notions as fictive, fabricated, and untrue to life into the word novelistic. Because human lives are composed in precisely such a fashion. But is not an event in fact more significant and noteworthy the greater the number of fortuities necessary to bring it about? Chance and chance alone has a message for us. Everything that occurs out of necessity, everything expected, repeated day in and day out, is mute. Only chance can speak to us.<BR>Tereza deeply believed in these episodes of chance and fate, believing their meeting was destined to be so. The more scientific Tomas was more inclined to believe, It could just as well be otherwise. Tereza did not know at first that Tomas was a reckless womanizer and that this would come to define both of them as their relationship progressed and in fact would be what further robbed Tereza of her individuality. Early in the prose, you learn that Terezas mother was cruel and deprived her of privacy and modesty. Terezas adult life is permeated by a sense of needing to feel different from and unique from others. With the love of a man, like Tomas, she expected she would find that he loved her and her alone, but his ceaseless, obsessive womanizing turned her into just another woman, just another body for him to use, in no way unique from any other woman in the world. Tereza had nightmares about her position. She had come to him to escape her mothers world, a world where all bodies were equal. She has come to him to make her body unique, irreplaceable. But he, too, has drawn an equal sign between her and the rest of them: he kissed them all alike, stroked them all alike, made no, absolutely no distinction between Terezas body and the other bodies. He had sent her back into the world she tried to escape, sent her to march naked with the other naked women. Tereza began to see life as a concentration camppeople living cramped together constantly in a complete obliteration of privacy.<BR>Tomas had many lovers, but among the most important (and central to the book) is Sabina. Sabina desired to disobey her father: Communism was merely another father, a father equally strict and limited, a father who forbade her love Sabina, like Tomas, could not be confined to one lover. She wanted to disobey convention. Not only did she have Tomas, she had many other lovers, including another central character to the book, Franz. Franz is from the West (I cannot recall whether he is from Austria or Switzerland, but I suspect the latter). For Franz, (Love) It meant a longing to put himself at the mercy of his partner. He who gives himself up like a prisoner of war must give up his weapons as well. And deprived in advance of defence against a possible blow, he cannot help wondering when the blow will fall. That is why I can say that for Franz, love meant the constant expectation of a blow. Franz believed, Culture is perishing in overproduction, in an avalanche of words, in the madness of quantity. Thats why one banned book in your (Sabinas) former country means infinitely more than the billions of words spewed out by our universities. <BR>Eventually Sabina and Tereza meet one another, and they form an unlikely friendship, and they both share the need for privacy that drives Terezas search for identity. The book describes a private and intimate scene in which Tereza (who is a photographer) and Sabina photograph one another, in various states of undress. They see one another for the individuals they are, not through the lens of Tomas or external barriers. <BR>Recurring images appear throughout the prose to illustrate different peoples places in other peoples lives, their relationships, perhaps. Kundera writes,  While people are fairly young and the musical composition of their lives is still in its opening bars, they can go about writing it together and exchange motifs (the way Tomas and Sabina exchanged the motif of the bowler hat), but if they meet when they are older, like Franz and Sabina, their musical compositions are more or less complete, and every motif, every object, every word means something different to each of them. Kundera goes on to include a dictionary of misunderstood words which describes how words can be interpreted differently by different people depending on so many factors. (As an example, WOMAN, not every woman was worthy of being called a woman. <BR>The characters all played roles with regard to the revolution that swept through Prague and eventually was crushed by Russian tanks. Tereza reflected on their naïveté. They had been so stupid, spending their days taking pictures of tanks and subversion. They believed they were risking their lives for their country when in fact the evidence they produced only helped the Russians in the end when the Russian overpowered the revolt. <BR>Many people tried to claim that ignorance about what Russian Communism entailed would serve as an excuse, but ignorance, as Kundera explains, was no excuse for Oedipus. Whether they knew or didnt know is not the main issue; the main issue is whether a man is innocent because he didnt know. Is a fool on the throne relieved of all responsibility merely because he is a fool?<BR>Oedipus did not know he was sleeping with his own mother, yet when he realized what had happened, he did not feel innocent. Unable to stand the sight of the misfortune he had wrought by not knowing, he put out his eyes and wandered blind away from Thebes. <BR>Everyone was suspect and everyone ready to hide from the ideals that began the revolt in the first place. Tomas was reprimanded at work and was told to print a retraction to an article or letter he had written, and he faced an odd decision as well as unusual reactions from those around him,  And suddenly Tomas grasped a strange fact: everyone was smiling at him, everyone wanted him to write the retraction: it would make everyone happy! The people with the first type of reaction would be happy because by inflating cowardice, he would make their actions seem commonplace and thereby give them back their lost honor. The people with the second type of reaction, who had come to consider their honor a special privilege never to be yielded, nurtured a secret love for the cowards, for without them their courage would soon erode into a trivial, monotonous grind admired by no one. <BR>When this book was new and fresh in my mind and imagination I had so many more points to make about its finer points. There are so many details and fine points to ponder, but it has been a year since I indulged in this book, and I feel I am the better for having indulged.	2001-10-11

The Rat never tells where he is or why he is writing. He seems to want something from the narrator, but this quest for what the Rat wants is just as mysterious as the chase through Japan for a unique sheep. <BR>The narrator is given two months to find the sheep. He decides to embark on the search, reluctantly, because it seems he has no alternatives. His new girlfriend, who is entirely unremarkable save for her stunning ears, accompanies him and, interestingly, often predicts the turns their path will take in her dreams. The two-month deadline in curtailed as the Boss takes a turn for the worse; they want to locate the sheep before the Boss dies. <BR>The narrator and his girlfriend travel to Hokkaido, where all clues point to the sheep being. The girlfriend has a feeling that they should stay at a place called The Dolphin Hotel. The narrator hates it there, but later they discover that the building used to be the Hokkaido Ovine Hall. SHEEP AT LAST! It also turns out that the father of the hotel's owner lives there and maintains the Sheep Reference Room on the 2nd floor of the hotel. The father is known as The Sheep Professor. The narrator and his girlfriend talk to the man and discover that the Sheep Professor indeed had been inhabited by the very same sheep they were chasing. He was a changed man after his encounter. \\"Can you imagine what it's like to be left with a solitary thought when its embodiment has been pulled out from underneath you, roots and all?\\" The Sheep Professor goes on, \\"The sheep that enters a body is thought to be immortal. And so too the person who hosts the sheep is thought to become immortal. However, should the sheep escape, the immortality goes.\\" Apparently, before the sheep embodied the Sheep Professor, no sheep of this kind had existed in Japan. The Sheep Professor had been a soldier in China, and that is when the sheep jumped into his body. <BR>The hotel owner sympathised with the narrator and his girlfriend and their quest for the sheep, but he had his own problems. He had never been able to get close to his father at all, and he blamed the sheep, \\"Sheep hurt my father, and through my father, sheep have also hurt me.\\" <BR>The narrator continues to search for the sheep but the search leads him closer and closer to where he believes his old friend Rat is staying. The narrator and girlfriend head to a villa up in the mountains where, it turns out, Rat must have been and might still be. Once there, the narrator begins to have encounters with a Sheep Man who gives him cryptic warnings. The girlfriend disappears mysteriously in the middle of the night and the Sheep Man tells the narrator he will never see her again. Eventually reality and fantasy mix, until it is not clear anymore (to the reader or to the narrator) what is quite real and what isn't. The narrator begins to realise that everything happening at the villa is like a \\"grotesque comedy of mishaps\\". <BR>As it turns out, the sheep with the cream-coloured star on its back had inhabited Rat, and he was the one orchestrating the whole affair of the narrator having to seek him out. The Rat is interacting with the narrator, but the Rat is basically already dead. The Rat recognised the destructive power of the sheep and had been driven crazy and decided to make sure the sheep could never escape again and hanged himself. The book ends in a surreal haze. Nevertheless, an entertaining haze. <BR>Sheep Chase is not Murakami's best work, but it is fascinating and highly detailed and unusual.	2001-10-10
US	52714831	ROYU8KV9UVVVA	014026566X	123895528	Boyhood: Scenes From Provincial Life	Books	4	4	7	N	N	BITTEREST ADOLESCENCE	So far I have preferred this brief novel over all the other Coetzee works I have read. It is not the most acclaimed novel, but somehow it is the most personal and accessible of his works. The others are challenging, yes, and subtle. Boyhood, though, is something deeply felt, still subtle, but very much something powerful and something people can relate to when they read it. <BR>The autobiographical story focuses on the narrator, a boy who has moved to a housing estate with his family-to a place with streets named after trees although there are no trees. A place with servant's rooms and no servants. The family is nothing like most of the other families around or indeed in much of South Africa. He lives in a strange world where children are not beaten, adults are called by their first names, they do not attend church, they are not Afrikaners... and in school when he is asked to declare a religion, he does not even understand the significance of declaring himself Catholic because he did not know what else to say. His upbringing is unusual and unnatural, in his opinion, because it involved no beatings. His father was an alcoholic and might have beaten him if the mother had not been so severely overprotective and against beatings. The narrator believes that if only once he were to be beaten he would suddenly be turned into a \\"normal\\" boy. There are frequent school beatings, but he does everything humanly possible to avoid those beatings because he knows he would never be able to bear the embarrassment of his reaction to being beat in school. <BR>At the centre of the boy's world is his mother whom he loves and reveres at the same time as being repelled by her very nature. She loves him in an overbearing and overprotective way; she changes her mind and mood often and contradicts herself constantly-he feels his life and world is crumbling around him with her fickle contradictions. He thoroughly belonged to her. <BR>He hates formulas, small talk and \\"being normal\\" or dull. His mother's family accepts his eccentricities; his father and his family do not. While he is deeply in love with the farm on his father's side of the family, he rarely gets to go there because he is an unwelcome guest. He feels free there, like he belongs to the farm. \\"He has two mothers. Twice-born: born from a woman and born from the farm. Two mothers and no father.\\" <BR>Mostly his entire adolescence is pervaded by uptight guilt and worry. Everything is his fault. When he begins to realise his sexual awakening, he ponders, \\"That is how the questioning always works. At first it may wander here and there; but in the end, unfailingly, it turns and gathers itself and points a finger at himself. Always it is he who sets the train of thinking in motion; always it is the thinking that slips out of his control and returns to accuse him. Beauty is innocence; innocence is ignorance; ignorance is ignorance of pleasure; pleasure is guilty; he is guilty.\\" <BR>Through the eyes of the adolescent narrator the book offers so many glimpses into routine, daily life and common ideas, stereotypes, and matter of fact questioning of life through the nave eyes of a boy. He reveals his embarrassment about the conventions of how Coloureds and whites are supposed to interact. He has a great deal of curiosity about the lives of the Coloureds and how they live. He reveals a deep hatred for Afrikaners and their inner rage. He worries that he will be moved to an Afrikaner class rather than an English one because he has an Afrikaner name. He excels in English and is deeply proud of his distance from the Afrikaner way of life, something in which he will never be \\"fluent\\". He has a strange reverence for England and all things English. He hears rumours that, although the Boer War is not on the official school syllabus, that Afrikaner classes are taught lessons about it as the \\"2nd War of Liberation\\". He feels guilt when he wastes food. (He and his younger brother take eggs that have been deliveredto their house and throw them at another house. \\"Perhaps elsewhere in the world one can throw eggs; but in this country there are judges who will judge by standards of righteousness. In this country one cannot be thoughtless about food.\\") <BR>When he seems to be settled into a certain routine, the family moves to Cape Town because his father is going to resume the practise of law. Unfortunately the practise is short-lived because the father drinks too much and in his need for \\"approval\\" unwisely lends money that isn't his to lend. The family is financially destroyed. And while the boy once loved school, he has grown to feel only passionate rage and nervousness all the time. Cape Town is making him grow stupid and provides no challenges. The bitterness of awkward adolescence dawns: he does not like himself and constantly feels embarrassed. Something to which we can all relate.  <BR>\\"'Wait until you have children of you own,' she says to him in one of her bitterer moods. `Then you will know.' What will he know? It is a formula she uses, a formula that sounds as if it comes from the old days. Perhaps it is what each generation says to the next, as a warning, as a threat. But he does not want to hear it. `Wait until you have children.' What nonsense, what a contradiction! How can a child have children? Anyway, what he would know if he were a father, if he were his own father, is precisely what he does not want to know. He will not accept the vision that she wants to force upon him: sober, disappointed, disillusioned.\\" <BR>As with most Coetzee novels there is no great \\"ending\\". It just ends. It feels better that way. The book simply speaks for itself which its eloquence and elegance, even in conveying the awkward and gangly phases of a young boy's life.	2001-09-18
US	52714831	R2U7E09ZFDUQLM	0679724494	368350214	Kiss of the Spider Woman	Books	4	25	34	N	N	NO ONE OPPRESSES THE OTHER IN THIS CELL	Kiss of the Spider Woman was a book I had always wanted to read but never did. Then a friend was studying it in his university, and when he finished it, he loaned the book to me. Unfortunately the continuity of the story was interrupted when I reached the halfway point because he asked for the book back for a number of weeks (he needed it for finals). So I think the book is definitely not one of the sort you can start and then pick back up again in a few months. You need to have some concentration to be engaged in the story. It also helps to have some background and context to place the story in. <BR>Almost the entire story takes place in a jail cell between a revolutionary, Valentin,  and a homosexual window dresser, Molina,  who has been put there to attempt to learn secrets from his cell mate to undermine the revolution. As the story progresses, though, a very strong bond between the two inmates develops. Molina tells stories about films he has seen in order to pass their time together, and they begin to discuss the films, then philosophy and finally life. They share a very reluctant, slow-growing friendship but eventually grow quite close, intimately close. Their friendship is unlikely but is developed with great consideration by Puig, making it believable and plausible throughout each stage. The two men learn to care about one another and show immense compassion for one another. <BR>The movie descriptions are what bind the two together, bring out their common elements. Valentin grows sad at the end of each movie, having grown attached to the characters, much as the reader does with this book. They debate, \\"It can be a vice, always trying to escape from reality like that, it's like taking drugs or something. Because, listen to me, reality, I mean your reality, isn't restricted by this cell we live in.\\" Always the idea comes again-their dreams, hopes and feelings live on outside the cell and within the cell they are still free because they cannot be oppressed there. <BR>The story develops further through the use of simple conversations between the two men. You learn that Molina sees himself as a man and believes in traditional values: two people falling in love and marrying for a lifetime. Valentin, who is young and considers himself revolutionary, believes marriage and monogamy are wrong, bourgeois deception. Valentin exclaims, \\"There's no way I can live for the moment because my life is dedicated to political struggle, or, you know, political action, let's call it. Follow me? I can put up with everything in here, which is quite a lot... but it's nothing if you think about torture...\\" <BR>At some point both men grow sick from the food but refuse to go to the infirmary. Although some of these moments during the mens' illnesses are rather disgusting, they are plot devices to illustrate the growing compassion and intimacy between the two men. While one is quite embarrassed at having gone to the bathroom in his trousers, the other reassures him that it is fine, he will help him clean himself. While Valentin is ill he exposes his \\"bourgeois inside\\" revealing that he is still truly in love with Marta, his one true love who left the revolution to love him. He does not really love the woman for whom he left Marta. He went with the second woman because she was the leader of their revolutionary movement. <BR>Prisoners are allowed to have provisions brought to them by family once a week, but Molina's mother is sick and cannot come. Valentin will not tell his mother she can come because he does not want her to feel obligated. <BR>During Valentin's illness we discover that Molina is working with the prison to get Valentin to divulge revolutionary secrets to him. It appears that Molina originally went along with that plan in order to win freedom for himself, but eventually comes to care so much for Valentin that he does not really pursue information as ardently as he could. Molina gets the prison to provide provisions like what his mother would bring in order to fool Valentin into believing his mother is better. He also lets Valentin know that he may soon be getting out of prison. During this period of Molina nursing Valentin back to health, Valentin comes to trust Molina quite deeply, and eventually the two of them physically consummate their relationship, which becomes an ongoing occurrence. (\\"They no longer see themselves as men or women or themselves but as people who are `out of danger'\\"). <BR>Finally the day of Molina's release approaches, and he has agreed to do some things on the outside for Valentin. By this time it seems clear that he does not intend to give information to the prison officials. However, of course, the prison keeps Molina under surveillance once he has been released. The last film Molina tells Valentin about parallels their own situation in a sense. The film has a prostitute who is only a prostitute in order to feed the man she loves. This is remarkably similar to Molina's \\"selling his soul\\" to give the prison information... but he only does it to keep Valentin alive and healthy. <BR>Molina eventually asks Valentin for a kiss-the one thing they have not shared. Molina is \\"a spider woman that traps men in her web\\". Molina tells Valentin, \\"Valentin, you and my mom are the two people that I've loved most in the world.\\" <BR>And they never see one another again. Naturally a story like this has no happy ending to offer. But the book is so well written and so engaging that you will not mind wiping a few tears from your eyes.	2001-09-18

Wild Sheep Chase is just like it sounds in the title. It is a comedic meandering through the life of an aimless, newly divorced man with a penchant for the female ear. He works in an ad and translating agency. Actually, he suffers from indifference, lethargy and displays no ambition. He is approached by a mysterious man, asking him to seek out a specific sheep of a breed unknown to Japan. The sheep is distinctive for a cream coloured star located on its back. The mysterious man tells the narrator that this sheep once inhabited his boss (as well as various other individuals) and had ruined their lives when the sheep chose to leave these unwilling, unwitting hosts. The mans boss was once a powerful and important man, but now barely clung to survival, with a cyst in his brain and unbearable hallucinations (80% of them haunted by sheep). At first, the narrator is confused: why him? First of all, he viewed himself so mediocre that he was not qualified for a mission of this magnitude and impossibility. (Age certainly hasnt conferred any smarts on me. Character maybe, but mediocrity is a constant, as one Russian writer put it. Russians have a way with aphorisms. They probably spend all winter thinking them up.) The narrator argues that because he has nothing to lose, the man and his boss cannot threaten him. The man counters that every man has something to lose, but they only realise it when it is gone. It becomes clear also that the narrator has published a photo of this particular sheep (without knowing it). The narrators friend had sent him the picture and had asked him to distribute the picture as far and as wide as possible, to be seen by as many eyes as possible. <br />	2001-09-14

Have you ever wondered how the teams at Microsoft work? This book is an inside glimpse into how a work group there operates. It is not a comprehensive view of Microsoft and in fact each group could be said to have its own unique dynamics, but this book will provide a brief and useful view of the process of creating and shipping a product at Microsoft. This book follows several members of a group within a now defunct section of Microsoft. They were creating a product, and the book documents each persons feelings, opinions, and unique perspectives on getting their own jobs done and how they have to work together to accomplish the ultimate goal of creating a product. Microsoft employees, it is shown, have a great deal of personal freedom and latitude in doing their jobs, but when it comes to working together in a team, their very idiosyncratic personalities often conflict. Add to this a very strange but not surprising element of artists versus programmers versus project managers. Add yet more regular Microsoft employees versus contract employees. Whether the friction and problems the book conveys are real or not, they are perceived by many employees, which affects the work environment. An interesting aspect of the business model and organizational chart is that the employees are only a few levels (3 or 4) away from Bill Gates (or the highest level of the company). Most people at some point in their careers are required to present their work to Gates (or equivalent level) at some point. The book depicts Gates as a very temperamental and demanding person who will look at something which is next to perfect, get angry about its flaws, and yell at the creators insisting on something much better. And then when the presentation is over and the creators leave, Gates says something about how brilliant it was, but if people think he did not like it, they will strive to make it more perfect. The book might be dated by now. Organizations change a great deal in just a few years. Microsoft was not being threatened by the Justice Department when this book was written, and although MS was a huge company then it was not as big as it is now. The book is the first to point out the effects of organizational change, and Microsoft, like most large companies, goes through organizational change frequently. Interesting book... worthwhile read.	2001-09-08

(Beethoven)	...But Es knnte auch anders sein\\" (It could just as well be otherwise)... <BR>With a sweeping, stunning backdrop of Communism and the Prague Spring, Kundera's book probes the questions surrounding personal identity and individuality and what shapes lives and how people are robbed of individuality. As an entire society struggles to be recognised as an independent entity under threat of Russian tanks and violence, the characters seek individuality in their own ways. Indeed, this individuality is personified by the way each character perceives and feels love. <BR>The story of Tomas and Tereza, Sabina and Franz, as people, is compelling and beautiful (and tragic) enough. Kundera's writing style and rich, philosophical prose is all the more rewarding. It took me years to finally sit down and read this book, and I regret all the wasted time. The book is far more rewarding than the film of the same name because the prose is so deep and worthwhile. The film, too, is good because Lena Olin and Juliette Binoche are luminous as always. Daniel Day Lewis plays Tomas well because his real persona seems to fit that of Tomas so perfectly. <BR>Tomas is a doctor in Prague and happens to meet the woman who will be his wife, Tereza, when he travels out of town for some sort of conference. They meet by a number of chance occurrences, and the novel Anna Karenina is instrumental in bringing them together. \\"Early in the novel that Tereza clutched under her arm when she went to visit Tomas, Anna meets Vronsky in curious circumstances: they are at the railway station when someone is run over by a train. At the end of the novel, Anna throws herself under a train. This symmetrical composition-the same motif appears at the beginning and at the end-may seem quite \\"novelistic\\" to you, and I am willing to agree, but only on the condition that you refrain from reading such notions as \\"fictive\\", \\"fabricated\\", and \\"untrue to life\\" into the word \\"novelistic\\". Because human lives are composed in precisely such a fashion.\\" \\"But is not an event in fact more significant and noteworthy the greater the number of fortuities necessary to bring it about?\\" \\"Chance and chance alone has a message for us. Everything that occurs out of necessity, everything expected, repeated day in and day out, is mute. Only chance can speak to us.\\"<BR>Tereza deeply believed in these episodes of chance and fate, believing their meeting was destined to be so. The more scientific Tomas was more inclined to believe, \\"It could just as well be otherwise.\\" Tereza did not know at first that Tomas was a reckless womanizer and that this would come to define both of them as their relationship progressed and in fact would be what further robbed Tereza of her individuality. Early in the prose, you learn that Tereza's mother was cruel and deprived her of privacy and modesty. Tereza's adult life is permeated by a sense of needing to feel different from and unique from others. With the love of a man, like Tomas, she expected she would find that he loved her and her alone, but his ceaseless, obsessive womanizing turned her into just another woman, just another body for him to use, in no way unique from any other woman in the world. Tereza had nightmares about her position. \\"She had come to him to escape her mother's world, a world where all bodies were equal. She has come to him to make her body unique, irreplaceable. But he, too, has drawn an equal sign between her and the rest of them: he kissed them all alike, stroked them all alike, made no, absolutely no distinction between Tereza's body and the other bodies. He had sent her back into the world she tried to escape, sent her to march naked with the other naked women.\\" Tereza began to see life as a concentration camp-people living cramped together constantly in a \\"complete obliteration of privacy.\\"<BR>Tomas had many lovers, but among the most important (and central to the book) is Sabina. Sabina desired to disobey her father: \\"Communism was merely another father, a father equally strict and limited, a father who forbade her love...\\" Sabina, like Tomas, could not be confined to one lover. She wanted to disobey convention. Not only did she have Tomas, she had many other lovers, including another central character to the book, Franz. Franz is from the West (I cannot recall whether he is from Austria or Switzerland, but I suspect the latter). For Franz, \\"(Love) It meant a longing to put himself at the mercy of his partner. He who gives himself up like a prisoner of war must give up his weapons as well. And deprived in advance of defence against a possible blow, he cannot help wondering when the blow will fall. That is why I can say that for Franz, love meant the constant expectation of a blow.\\" Franz believed, \\"Culture is perishing in overproduction, in an avalanche of words, in the madness of quantity. That's why one banned book in your (Sabina's) former country means infinitely more than the billions of words spewed out by our universities.\\" <BR>Eventually Sabina and Tereza meet one another, and they form an unlikely friendship, and they both share the need for privacy that drives Tereza's search for identity. The book describes a private and intimate scene in which Tereza (who is a photographer) and Sabina photograph one another, in various states of undress. They see one another for the individuals they are, not through the lens of Tomas or external barriers. <BR>Recurring images appear throughout the prose to illustrate different people's places in other people's lives, their relationships, perhaps. Kundera writes,  \\"While people are fairly young and the musical composition of their lives is still in its opening bars, they can go about writing it together and exchange motifs (the way Tomas and Sabina exchanged the motif of the bowler hat), but if they meet when they are older, like Franz and Sabina, their musical compositions are more or less complete, and every motif, every object, every word means something different to each of them.\\" Kundera goes on to include a \\"dictionary of misunderstood words\\" which describes how words can be interpreted differently by different people depending on so many factors. (As an example, WOMAN, \\"not every woman was worthy of being called a woman.\\" <BR>The characters all played roles with regard to the revolution that swept through Prague and eventually was crushed by Russian tanks. Tereza reflected on their navet. They had been so stupid, spending their days taking pictures of tanks and subversion. They believed they were risking their lives for their country when in fact the evidence they produced only helped the Russians in the end when the Russian overpowered the revolt. <BR>Many people tried to claim that ignorance about what Russian Communism entailed would serve as an excuse, but ignorance, as Kundera explains, was no excuse for Oedipus. \\"Whether they knew or didn't know is not the main issue; the main issue is whether a man is innocent because he didn't know. Is a fool on the throne relieved of all responsibility merely because he is a fool?\\"<BR>\\"...Oedipus did not know he was sleeping with his own mother, yet when he realized what had happened, he did not feel innocent. Unable to stand the sight of the misfortune he had wrought by \\"not knowing\\", he put out his eyes and wandered blind away from Thebes.\\" <BR>Everyone was suspect and everyone ready to hide from the ideals that began the revolt in the first place. Tomas was reprimanded at work and was told to print a retraction to an article or letter he had written, and he faced an odd decision as well as unusual reactions from those around him,  \\"And suddenly Tomas grasped a strange fact: everyone was smiling at him, everyone wanted him to write the retraction: it would make everyone happy! The people with the first type of reaction would be happy because by inflating cowardice, he would make their actions seem commonplace and thereby give them back their lost honor. The people withthe second type of reaction, who had come to consider their honor a special privilege never to be yielded, nurtured a secret love for the cowards, for without them their courage would soon erode into a trivial, monotonous grind admired by no one.\\" <BR>Kundera delves into various subject matter, such as the matter of excrement, \\"Shit is a more onerous theological problem than is evil. Since God gave man freedom, we can, if need be, accept the idea that He is not responsible for man's crimes.

Highly useful and detailed grammatical information, extensive vocabulary and accompanying-necessary-information on usage as well as irregularities in form or usage (declensions or conjugations). Having compared many Russian and English dictionaries this is by far the most comprehensive resource you can get in a user-friendly and compact format at a reasonable price. This is one of the best foreign language dictionaries I have used in my extensive foreign language studies. The dictionary is touted as a first of its kind geared to American English rather than British. I don't know how true this is, but as an American, I know it was useful to me either way. This book eased my days as a student considerably... I loved my old one so much I passed it on to a friend and got a new one last time I was in the States.	2001-09-08

The introduction paints a grim portrait of the future unless all people take responsibility to demand that their economic systems take a turn toward the local, not the global. We have all been told that globalisation is inevitable and above all beneficial and profitable to all of us. This books makes the case, with a series of well-documented and well-organized essays by scholars, intellectuals and individuals at the forefront of the anti-globalisation movement, that nothing could be further from the truth. Globalisation benefits corporations, not people. Most people believe that globalisation has nothing to do with them, and if it does, it only means that goods for those in the western world will probably become cheaper or jobs in the west will be lost to cheaper labour and production costs overseas. But in everyday American life,  the problems inherent in all of this are not investigated or talked about at all. If you do ask questions about these problems, you are relegated to the dustbin of far-left environmentalists or far-right protectionists. Mander writes in his concise introduction, Economic globalisation involves arguably the most fundamental redesign of the planets political and economic arrangements since at least the Industrial Revolution. Yet the profound implications of these fundamental changes have barely been exposed to serious public scrutiny or debate. He continues, We are now being asked to believe that the development processes that have further impoverished people and devastated the planet will lead to diametrically different and highly beneficial outcomes, if only they can be accelerated and applied everywhere, freely, without restrictions Mander makes this point and questions HOW? How can this possibly benefit people when what is clearly happening is corporate colonialism? Mander argues that the measures taken by a globalised economy will be tantamount to the global homogenisation of culture, lifestyle, level of technological immersion. In other words, every place will be the same as every other place and there will be no reason to leave your home. Maybe for some people this will be an ideal world to live in. Who knows? Economists have created measures of economic well being that do not reflect anything about the way and quality of life. There will always be winners and losers in the competitive and capitalistic society, and on a globalised level we can only see, in the short term, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. In the long term we will see, as Mander illustrates in his introduction and the following essays demonstrate with more evidence, that growth and prosperity can only be temporary and unsustainable because resources, both renewable and non-renewable, will be used so quickly and haphazardly that growth and progress cannot be sustained. Co-editor Goldsmith writes even for the biggest winners, it will be like winning at poker on the Titanic.	2001-09-08
US	52714831	R3RK05W61FZXVJ	0425098478	986630902	The One Minute Manager	Books	3	11	21	N	N	CONFUCIUS SAID &quot;THE ESSENCE OF KNOWLEDGE IS, HAVE IT, USE IT	The One Minute Manager is one of those books that stands even on grocery store shelves, which indicates to me not only that it is a best-seller but also that it is for people with short attention spans who crave repetition. In fact, the One Minute Manager is one of those books that is easy about which to generalize without even reading it first. You, like me, might be wrong about your pre-conceived notions about it. But it is nearly inevitable to make judgments about the book before reading it. While the content turns out to be more useful and less dismissive than I first feared it might, a book of this style and (considerable lack of) length really lends validation and credibility to a managerial style suited for those without real leadership skills-the brush off, the rude and direct kiss off or needless and personal criticism. Sure, when time is limited we may not have the time to be sensitive and to speak deliberately in soft metaphors that cushion the real and blunt intent of our words. However, tact is always appropriate, but this book somehow excuses those who choose to communicate in a non-productive but always critical fashion, even though the book's content by no means condones such tactics. The book's style might lead you to dismiss it as I originally did. It offers quick, keen, simplistic distillations, a McDonaldization fast food approach, if you will, to dealing with people. Never having managed people, I always had the impression that I have been managed by people who absorb the brief and oversimplified &quot;methods&quot; espoused here. Read the eminent qualifications of the writers (developers of the &quot;one minute system&quot;) and you will be convinced that they definitely discovered the essence of this fast food managerial style. Maybe Blanchard and Johnson have perfected it, but in true self-help &quot;hackery&quot; those who read the book will selectively choose bits and pieces of the philosophy to apply to their own stylistics or, worse yet,will adopt the book's tenets with almost Biblical reverence and live all facets of life according to the One Minute Gospel. This sort of book is theoretically dangerous if misapplied because it very easily and summarily reduces people, problems and communication to ONE MINUTE. It reeks of shallowness and erases the human face of management (much like Boeing executives who recently announced that they will leave Seattle. Most likely so they will not have to face the employees when the time comes to fire them). Strangely the simplicity of the book is deceiving. Some people who employ these theories fail to remember the very first and overriding principle the book names, &quot;The One Minute Manager's symbol-a one minute readout from the face of a modern digital watch-is intended to remind each of us to take a minute out of our day to look into the faces of the people we manage. And to realize that they are our most important resources.&quot; This book encourages managers to discover &quot;how people produce valuable results and feel good about themselves&quot;, but the &quot;knowledge&quot; most people gain from this book in reading it is seldom applied this way. For example, the book emphasizes giving constructive criticism... letting an employee know immediately when s/he has done something good or when s/he has done something wrong and why. A close friend's manager, as an example of a horror story of misapplied principles, read an employee's write-up of something and wrote an expletive in LARGE, red letters across the text of the write-up but failed to provide any insight as to why he wrote that or why he felt it necessary to belittle the work of his employee. He might ask himself the question that the book asks, &quot;How on earth can I get results if it's not through people? I care about people AND results. They go hand in hand.&quot; It is only natural and logical that if you belittle, ridicule, or mistreat your employees, they will not respect you as their manager, will not be as willing to give their best and will certainly be less productive as a result. &quot;Productivity is both quantity and quality.&quot; In the One Minute Management philosophy there are three simple precepts which the One Minute Manager establishes with his employees: One Minute Goal Setting, One Minute Praisings, and One Minute Reprimands. These are all very logical steps-goal setting makes sure that employees understand perfectly what their duties are, what is expected of them and that there are no surprises. Many times in real life managers assume employees know exactly what to do without sitting down with them and concisely defining the goals. (A problem exists if there is a difference between what is actually happening and what you desire to be happening). Sadly, a common description of a misguided manager sounds a lot like managers I have encountered, including those who have read this book. They focus on the negative and do not make their expectations clear. Then they &quot;zap&quot; the employee at a performance review to make themselves look good or like they are administering discipline, an approach completely full of vanity and professional insecurity. It also leads to unhappy and fearful employees and benefits no one. One Minute Praising is all about the manager catching the employee doing something right and giving her/him immediate feedback. This is seen as a motivator, with constructive progress reports, focused on the positive. Lastly, the one minute reprimands are honest, direct, specific &quot;what's wrong with what you did and why&quot; moments. These moments are handled with sensitivity and define only wrong behavior not personal attacks on an individual. The book, my friends, is basically common sense. Plain and simple. &quot;People are not pigeons. People are more complicated. They are aware, they think for themselves, and they certainly don't want to be manipulated by another person. Remember that and respect that. It is a keyto good management.&quot; This is one statement I can take away from this book, feeling like the 80 or so pages were worthwhile. Now if only I could plaster that statement across the foreheads of the bad managers throughout the world.	2001-09-08

The story itself is nothing particularly special, leaning heavily on fantastic elements, but it should be entertaining enough for children and adults alike. This book is especially of use to those who want to learn Icelandic and have no idea where or how to start.

I read this book a few years ago as a requirement for my Master's degree in public administration. I read along with interest because the story that unfolded read like some sort of sordid drama, like something you might see on prime time television. It had suspense, intrigue, and some of the most stunning ups and downs. And all this from a book that attempts to comprehensively explain the hopeful beginnings and hopeless endings of the Clintons' (both Bill and more specifically Hillary) attempts to implement universal health care in the United States. Think back, if you will, to the campaign promises Bill Clinton made in his first campaign. He vowed to fight for universal health care. Many Americans like this idea, but when it comes right down to it, most Americans do not trust the government to provide their health care and also feel that government intervention in private health care makes the system... socialist. Bill wanted to change this, and when he was elected, he appointed his wife, Hillary, to chair a committee to research and implement this new universal health care system. However, this was his first mistake. The American people at that time were very suspicious and skeptical of Mrs. Clinton, feeling that she did not embody what a First Lady should be. They also felt that she had demonstrated no real qualifications for this appointment. The writers of this book document the controversies and problems brilliantly. I felt confident about the facts... until I was happily reading along (the book, despite its daunting length, reads through smoothly and quickly) and found a most glaring and heinous error. The writers were discussing the positions of Fred Grandy, who, after leaving television, went on to represent his home state of Iowa in Congress. We all know Fred Grandy as Gopher on the tv show Love Boat. But this book said that he had been a star on the show Gilligan's Island! I started to exercise real doubt and skepticism about a book that managed to get through all stages of editing with such an easily spotted error on its pages. Whatever the case, if you want to know how the plan was formed and how it was unraveled quite easily not just by opposition Republicans but also by Hillary herself, you should indeed read this. Hillary and her policy wonk friend Ira Magaziner had many opportunities to compromise on some of the points in their health care plan which would have made it an easier sell to Republicans. In fact many Republicans offered to work with Hillary and Magaziner, but the stubborn duo insisted on having the plan intact... and ended up getting nothing. As did the American people.	2001-09-08

I probably never will love it, but I can appreciate and admire it for the fact that Achebe captures something of the essence and non-linear quality of living in an oral/verbal culture rather than one that is more focused on reading and writing. The stories of oral traditions are passed on by word of mouth and therefore change slightly with retelling.

As you get older, the bottom line becomes to survive as best you can.\\" -\\"It's your world now... it's yours.\\" <br />Douglas Coupland is popular with my generation, most likely because he makes keen observations about life from a perspective people of the X Generation can understand and relate to. Heck he must be the expert since he coined the term &quot;Generation X&quot;. However, he also must appeal to the ME ME ME IT'S ALL ABOUT ME self-centredness that is a part of the nature of most people of this generation. Also it must appeal to their short attention spans and complete irreverence toward just about everything. I recognise that this is a generalisation, and I am not condemning Coupland nor his fans. I am simply saying that Coupland's writing style is idiosyncratic and definitely has one target audience. I read his earlier works, and I enjoyed them more or less, but there is a quality to Coupland's writing that seems very surface and artificial despite his astute and timely observations about people and things. Coupland is genuinely witty in his writing, but most of the time I find that he tries too hard. What I mean by this is that he overreaches for authenticity. For example, in Microserfs, he writes about how he went shopping at the Uwajimaya on 156th in Bellevue. Locals will be impressed that he knows his stuff and people from outside of the greater Bellevue/Redmond/Eastside area will be impressed with his knowledge, or maybe his imagination if they don't know that Uwajimaya is really on 156th in Bellevue. The problem for me, though, is that these little things just go too far by a tiny amount that just push these references right over the thin line of what is cleverand what is trying too hard. Maybe just Uwajimaya in Bellevue OR Uwajimaya on 156th. Either/or but not both! Just too many offhand refences to places, landmarks (like the now-imploded Kingdome) and local \\"things\\" to prove he had actually done his homework or something. I know some people were very impressed by that level of detail, but I found it, once again, artificial. <br />Coupland writes Microserfs like a journal and brings up many interesting points, like how Gen X parents expected their company to take care of them forever and in exchange the employees gave unwavering loyalty. Gen Xers think of almost all jobs as temporary stepping stones to something else. Interestingly, most of what technical talk Coupland included is all pretty out of date considering that the software industry moves like lightning. Most of the interesting observations come in the beginning of the book when the main character is still working for Microsoft. Most of Coupland's references are so dead-on with regard to Microsoft culture and life, which is probably why most Microsofties read it and like it. However, when all the employees move to the Bay Area to work at a start-up, the book completely loses direction and all sense of coherence. <br />The narrator, Dan, discusses his co-workers and their quirks, discusses how he does not understand what exactly the \\"Information Superhighway\\" is supposed to be and goes off on a tangent about how major freeway construction died around 1975. He notes that only foreign employees at Microsoft seem to smoke, and it is not a surprise that user-friendliness is a West Coast American concept. Later in the book, the observations deteriorate to Dan reporting what his friends have said, such as the reasons why breakfast cereals are \\"decadent\\" or Karla and other characters discussing how their Barbie dolls had sex lives. <br />Yes the book explores the ever-searching nature of people born in this generation, yes the book examines the culture of Microsoft andcan be painstakingly funny in doing so, and yes the book is readable. Is it great? Is it a classic? No. It can be read in a half day for fun, and that should be all you read it for.	2001-06-10

Saramago mixes reality with fiction and does so seamlessly, effortlessly and creatively. The reader is simply lost in the splendour of his prose, lost in the relationships of the characters. I can only imagine how the prose flows in its original Portuguese, but the English translations generally convey the essence of Saramago's stories with clarity. <br />Sete-Sóis (Baltasar) is a soldier (\\"there is no existence more miserable than a soldier's.\\") His hand is amputated in war, and he has attachments made to use in place of his missing hand. Blimunda is the daughter of a condemned woman. Baltasar and Blimunda meet when her mother is sentenced to exile in Angola. They meet simply when Blimunda turns to Baltasar, a stranger, and asks his name. They make love upon their first meeting, and Baltasar is completely bewitched by Blimunda. \\"When Baltasar woke next morning, he saw Blimunda lying at his side, eating brad, but with her eyes firmly closed. She only opened them when she had finished eating, at that moment they looked grey, and she told him, I shall never look into your soul.\\" From that moment on they are never apart. Baltasar and Blimunda deeply love each other in a simple, uncomplicated way and learn about each other as time goes by. Baltasar learns that Blimunda must eat when she wakes up: when she has been fasting (as anyone does while sleeping) she can see inside of people. Baltasar worries that Blimunda is connected with the supernatural and will fall victim to the Inquisition (as indeed Blimunda's mother and many other people have). \\"I only see what is in the world, I cannot see what lies beyond it, whether it be heaven or hell, I practise neither enchantments nor hypnosis, I simply see things, Yet you signed yourself with your own blood, then made the sign of the cross on my chest with the same blood, surely that is witchcraft, the blood of virginity is the water of baptism...\\" Blimunda can see inside of people's bodies and sometimes beneath the earth. <br />Baltasar meets Padre Bartolomeu Lourenço, who is widely known as the Flying Man. Padre Lourenço knows Blimunda quite well, and when Baltasar asks the Flying Man about her, the Padre answers, \\"Flying is simple when compared with Blimunda.\\" The Flying Man, it turns out, is called such because he is building a flying machine, which he calls the Passarola. The Flying Man enlists Baltasar and Blimunda to help him build the Passarola, and for a long while this is how they occupy their time. <br />Throughout the book a story is told of a convent being built in Mafra (which is Baltasar's hometown). The convent takes years to be built, and the story of its complications and problems is weaved throughout the story of Baltasar and Blimunda. <br />The Passarola will fly, according to the calculations of the Flying Man, using the wills/souls of people. Also \\"If the sun attracts the amber, and the amber attracts the ether, and the ether attracts the magnets, and the magnets attract the metal, the machine will be drawn toward the sun without being able to stop.\\" The Passarola will have sails to prevent it from sailing directly to the sun. The Flying Man asks Blimunda to collect souls of people because she is gifted with the ability to see within people which souls are willing to leave their bodies. She does so, but she becomes gravely ill and is revived only once the palace musician Domenico Scarlatti comes to see the Passarola and plays his harpsichord. Scarlatti exclaims that he wishes he could play his harpsichord when the Passarola is aloft. Blimunda states, \\"'Once the machine starts to fly, the heavens will be filled with music', and Baltasar, remembering the war, interjected, `Unless the heavens turn out to be hell.' This couple can neither write nor read, yet they can say things that seem most unlikely at such a time and in such a place.\\" <br />Blimunda also meets Baltasar's family in Mafra and at various points in the book, Baltasar and Blimunda visit, live or work in Mafra (usually working at the site of the convent's building).<br />The Passarola eventually does fly, carrying the Flying Man, Baltasar and Blimunda, but it does not fly under the ideal circumstances. The Flying Man is being pursued by the Inquisition, and he would rather escape than have them catch him (\\"Drawn curtains also serve for the confessional, the father confessor seated on the outside, the penitents, one after the other, kneeling on the inside, which is precisely where both constantly commit sins of lust, besides being cohabitants, if that word is not more grievous than sin itself, a sin readily absolved, however, by Padre Bartolomeu Lourenço, who has before his eyes an even greater sin, namely that of ambition and pride, for he plans to ascend into the heavens one day, where so far only Christ and the Virgin have made their ascent along with a few chosen saints...\\") When Baltasar and Blimunda deliver what should be good news to Lourenço about the completion of the Passarola, he manages only to be nervous, \\"If the machine were to fly now, the Holy Office might decide that there is some Satanic power behind this flight, and if they were to investigate which parts of the invention cause the machine to fly, I should find it impossible to reveal that there are human wills inside the globes, in the eyes of the Inquisition there are no wills, only souls, they will accuse us of imprisoning Christian souls and of preventing them from going up to paradise.\\" Blimunda wants to know where they will flee to; Lourenço simply replies that they should go somewhere \\"where the arm of the Inquisition cannot reach us, if such a place exists.\\" As the Passarola ascends,no one looks up or seems to notice, \\"This nation, which expects so much from heaven, scarcely ever looks up where heaven is said to be.\\" <br />Eventually the threesome lands someplace, and Lourenço begins to panic, \\"We're in more danger now as we were before leaving the estate, if the Inquisition didn't find us yesterday, they will certainly capture us tomorrow. But where are we, what is this place called. Every place on earth is the antechamber of hell...\\" Eventually after nightfall Lourenço attempts to set the Passarola on fire, \\"If I have to be burnt in a fire, let it at least be this one.\\" <br />Baltasar and Blimunda return on foot the next day to Mafra and live there for many years to come, while Baltasar returns every few months to check on the Passarola, which is hidden under brush. Lourenço escaped to Spain and apparently died in Toledo (according to what the musician Scarlatti later reported to Baltasar and Blimunda). <br />On one of his visits to clean the Passarola in its hiding place, Baltasar accidentally gets caught in the machine, and it flies away. For nine long years thereafter, Blimunda wandered the entire country searching for Baltasar. As she wanders, she comes to be known as the Flying Woman on account of her strange tale. In her search she endures hardship and even has to kill a man. She passes through Lisboa six times and on her seventh, she does find her Baltasar, but not in good circumstances. <br />The story, perhaps needless to say, does not end happily, but Saramago is never overly dramatic or emotional with his prose.  It is complex and rich with detail but never sentimental. \\"Eleven people have been sentenced. The stake is already ablaze and the faces of the victims are barely distinguishable. The last man to be burned has his left hand missing. Perhaps because of his blackened beard, a miraculous transformation caused by the soot, he looks much younger. And there is a dark cloud in the centre of his body. Then Blimunda said, Come. The will of Baltasar Sete-Sóis broke free from his body, but did not ascend to the stars, for it belonged to the earth and to Blimunda.\\"	2001-06-10

It is almost mystical and mysterious, and you think \\"south of the border\\" must be an amazing place. The disappointment and disillusionment you must feel when you reach adulthood and realise the song is just talking about Mexico shatters any illusions you may have had in those innocent days of childhood. This is the case with the narrator of the story, who narrates a seemingly simple story of unrequited love that began with childhood friendship and afternoons listening to various music that formed the soundtrack for the rest of his life. The story is deceptive in its straightforward quality: very under-the-radar, so to speak. The narrator, Hajime, a Japanese man who owns successful jazz clubs outside of Tokyo, weaves a tale that can either be interpreted on its surface level... a love story, complete with loss and tragedy. Or it can be delved into more deeply. \\"South of the Border\\" certainly has its obvious double entendre. It can signal the beginning of a sexual awakening (it is no coincidence, either, that the main character is named Hajime-which means \\"beginning\\"). Also for the children, narrator and his friend Shimamoto, (we only ever learn her last name, which is another indicator of the wall that she kept up to shield herself from the outside world) \\"South of the Border\\" was something far off, exotic and unattainable. In a sense, this is exactly how Hajime felt about Shimamoto. He felt he lost her after they lost contact, and that love could never be equalled. Later when he discovered what \\"South of the Border\\" meant he felt like he had been deceived. <br />The book is filled with imagery of this sort that can conjure up many deeper meanings than are obvious. The narrator tells of his life and girlfriends he has had and how he has hurt some of them, one of them irreparably. In his life, he always returns to thoughts of Shimamoto and to the girlfriend he hurt (Izumi). Meanwhile, his life goes on. He finds that he has very little motivation for anything, and after college becomes a textbook editor, which he hates. He meets his wife, Yukiko, when he is 30, and Yukiko's father takes a liking to Hajime, which is fortuitous in that it allows him to alter the path of his professional life and open the jazz bars... but this leads to a great deal of destruction in his personal life. Shimamoto reappears after not having seen Hajime since they were young teenagers. Eventually they confess that they are still in love with one another, although Shimamoto is quite different and very mysterious. Shimamoto enters and leaves Hajime's life easily, and the reader never learns the details of her alternate life. You only discover that she has effectively turned Hajime's life upside down. <br />\\"Everyone just keeps on disappearing. Some things just vanish, like they were cut away. Others fade slowly into the mist. And all that remains is a desert.\\" <br />This is a splendidly crafted novel and can appeal to the reader on many levels. (And Hajime's first girlfriend's father is a Japanese Communist dentist tennis fanatic who named the family dog Karl after Karl Marx. You will probably never see such an inventive character again in your life!)	2001-01-29

I am used to a gentler Murakami style, and this book did not adhere to that formula, which only attests to Murakami's genius, even if this book was not as appealing to me personally. The book seems to take a cue from the fantasy realm populated by books such as Douglas Adams' Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy. At times the book was so far outside the lines of reality and so far into technological psychobabble and artful, creative meanderings of the writer's mind that it is positively confusing to decipher. It was indeed quite thought-provoking and at times quite vivid in creating certain feelings in the reader (for example, claustrophobia and fear in the section when the main character is wandering through underground caves with another person). The book can be fascinating, technical, murky, strange, engaging, and eccentric all at once. The use of the word \\"wonderland\\" in the title is quite fitting. Interestingly, the book points out some very obvious things which we never think about. For example, the main character is part of a life, an organization, that the average citizen knows nothing about. His life is completely a mystery, and even if he were to describe it to someone they would find him crazy. It illustrates how little we really know about other people and how cut off from experience we are. In our society we are able to see news 24 hours a day and are content thinking that we have all the facts, when in fact, we never know what is propaganda if we never seek out alternative media sources. For example. An interesting point to make is that this book is like reading two separate books. In alternating chapters, two stories are told, although one appears to be the everyday life of the narrator and the alternate chapters are of a town that is actually the narrator's unconscious mind. Because this book was a bit confusing I am not certain that my interpretation is correct nor that it is the only interpretation. In fact, I am sure that many different people could come up with infinite interpretations. As a result of experiments conducted on the narrator without his knowledge, it is clear that he will lose his conscious mind, as he knows it, and live in a world of his own creation in his mind. New memories are created by some sort of implants in his mind that bridge different parts of his brain (natural and implanted), creating a parallel world he will come to live in. It is not clear if he literally lives or dies. But it does not matter. This is a carefully crafted work that requires thought.	2001-01-29

It is also a timely one, although not universally popular considering its rather lax treatment of ETA violence. Kurlansky does perhaps harbour sympathies for the Basque people and even for the most extreme of their nationalist tendencies, but he does not let this completely cloud his judgment, and it is not entirely clear that Kurlansky \\"takes sides\\" or endorses one course of action or another. I can see why it would be easy to become so attached to the Basques and their culture, their language, and the ongoing fight they have pursued in order to keep these fundamentals of who they are intact. People deserve to keep their history, heritage, language, and cuisine, and the Basques have a long, rich, and misunderstood history which deserves the kind of recognition Kurlansky's book brings to their cause, wherever Kurlansky's personal sympathies lie. <br />I felt that Kurlansky presented basically unbiased information, particularly about the history of the Basques in centuries past. The book is filled with revelations about this formidable and fascinating culture, and I feel that these kinds of explorations in Kurlansky's research and writing dominated this work much more so than current political issues or separatist violence. Sure, it is easy enough for me to say this, completely isolated from the violence and the everyday problems these tense relations may create, but I can say that there are groups in the world who are routinely terrorized by other groups without provocation. (Perhaps \\"terrorized\\" is not the ideal word choice because I do not see a reign of terror in the making. I do see that some people may perceive the unrest as such depending on their vantage point). <br />I, however, was an interested reader who was wholly ignorant of Basque culture and history and wanted to learn more. I got lucky when I wandered through the Halifax, Nova Scotia airport one afternoon and found this book there. Kurlansky has written a well-organized, clear, and thoughtful introduction to the Basque people... people who are misunderstood, underrepresented, and unknown in some cases (I rarely meet Americans, for example, who know what a Basque is. When I tell them they scoff and wonder why I would care to know). I emphasize that I consider this book to be only an introduction or a stepping stone. Kurlansky has not provided the definitive and comprehensive history of the Basque people. He has merely provided a useful tool for further study. One thing that was a fascinating, albeit seemingly random, addition to his work was the interweaving of Basque culinary information. Although I sincerely enjoyed those tidbits, I found their placement a bit annoying.<br />At the heart of the book is the question that lingers on... &quot;if Euskera is the oldest living language in Europe, are the Basques the oldest European culture?\\" Euskera has been called an impossible, obscure and incomprehensible language, and for much of history the Euskera speakers were left to themselves, and they developed and explored (as other reviewers point out). They became expert whalers and fishermen, the world's first capitalists, industrialists and the first modern bankers in Spain. Yet there is little more than speculation to corroborate ideas that the Basques were so advanced, particularly in crossing the Atlantic earlier than anyone else. <br />Major turning points for the Basques have included the 1600s, when, as a nationless nationality, they were more or less locked out of the fishing industry. In the 1700s, the abolition of the Basque traditional laws, the Fueros, followed by the abolition of traditionally collectively held land, also seemed to change things. A pivotal character in the history of Basque nationalism was Sabino Arana, who invented words to create a nation, if in language only, for the Euskera speaking people. \\"In the Basque language, which is called Euskera, there is no word for Basque. The only word to identify a member of their group is Euskaldun-Euskera speaker. Their land is called Euskal Herria-the land of Euskera speakers. It is language that defines a Basque.\\" Arana wanted to change this by making a new word-Euskadi-to give their region a name. <br />This is another key question-what exactly makes a person Basque? Is it parentage, residence in Basqueland, or speaking the language? The definition of a Basque has changed over time, but Kurlansky did a fine job exploring some of the changes in attitude and questions surrounded what makes a person Basque. In recent years, there has been a renaissance of \\"Basqueness\\" and trying to discover Basqueness. People in the region have been learning and teaching Basque language and culture, and there has been a more prolific creation of a Basque literature. I felt that these issues were key to the book, or at least I hope they were, because that was the most beautiful idea I could think of. The Basque people have survived centuries of adversity, and I think it is much more useful to look at the everyday people rather than ETA extremism. I feel inspired to travel to the Basque region and also to take up the study of Euskera myself (for anyone interested, the University of Nevada in Reno, USA offers online courses and even a PhD program in Basque!)	2001-01-29

He has a profound impact on the futures of Bjartur's entire family. The teacher asks what wishes the kids each want to come true. Ásta's constant need for love and approval from father figure lead her to wish for love, which she believes she receives when she and the teacher start an affair together, which makes her feel scared but loved. She feels she is sinning, but the teacher replies, \\"Sin-sin is God's most precious gift.\\" When the teacher leaves, and Ásta is left confused, there is a telling scene between Ásta and her brother, Nonni, when Nonni tries to understand Ásta's sadness. \\"This was the first time that he has ever looked into the labyrinth of the human soul. He was very far from understanding what he saw. But what was of more value, he felt and suffered with her. In years that were yet to come, he relived this memory in song, in the most beautiful song this world has known. For the understanding of the soul's defencelessness, of the conflict between the two poles, is not the source of the greatest song. The source of the greatest song is sympathy.\\"<br />When Ásta is to be baptized, finally, in the church, it is discovered that she is pregnant, and Bjartur, at this point, is heartbroken. Being the strict man that he is, he cannot forgive her and shuns her for life. Ásta is also heartbroken. The one important person in her life has left her at a time when she needed him most. Bjartur denies that he is even Ásta's father, claiming that Ásta's mother had had affairs with other men, so Ásta should seek out her real family. <br />No matter what biology might have to say, after Ásta leaves, she is still Bjartur's daughter through and through. Later in life, when Bjartur's son Gvendur is leaving for America, he tries to give his sheep to Ásta as a gift, and Ásta, now with her daughter Björt (the feminine form of Bjartur) states, \\"My little girl and I are independent people also, you see; we also are a sovereign state. Björt and I love freedom just as much as our namesake does. We would rather be free to die than have to accept anyone's gifts.\\" Ásta does not lead an easy life from this point on, but Bjartur does not care... at least not until the end. <br />Bjartur lives by the notion that nothing is worse than eating other people's bread. Literally and figuratively speaking. \\"Other folk's bread is the most virulent form of poison that a free and independent man can take; other folk's bread is the only thing that can rob him of independence and the one true freedom.\\"	2001-01-25

Early on in this novel, the main character, Olympia, asks her father if she is to be governess to another main character's children. Olympia's father is a very wealthy man, you learn immediately upon reading this book, so naturally you would never expect Olympia to be working. Her father's emphatic reply, \\"Certainly not!; Heavens, Olympia, how could you have imagined I would exploit you in such a manner?\\" My question is, \\"Okay, who will they exploit instead?\\" <br />I was given this book as a gift. It is not my style. I would never read something like this of my own choosing. The book is overly detailed but not in a complex or engaging way. It is too simple, too stilted (particularly conversations, which appear to be overwrought and not at all the way people would really speak). Shreve has written a book in the difficult third person, but she does not really succeed in this style. It is just too mechanical and not believable. The central relationship in the story, that of Olympia to John Haskell, does not have any great authenticity to it somehow. The adjectives are all there, but the depth of feeling is just not felt somehow. I cannot see why either of the two characters would sacrifice everything that they did in the book. I also found the contrived happyish ending to be a bit over the top. <br />I am not saying that this is not a good book, nor am I saying that it is not readable. I read it in one night. It does engage you enough to want to find out what happens in the story. The characters also succeed in taking on a life of their own and are not at all one-dimensional. This will appeal to many people and will serve as a wonderful book for entertainment purposes. I am sure this is already a bestseller, a few steps above and more intelligent than a common romance novel.  Shreve, while possessing considerable talent and the power to appeal to a broad audience, has not delivered the caliber or... genre book that I would personally prefer.  Nobel probably would not favour a body of work comprised of novels like this either.	2001-01-25

She had lost all anticipation and had long grown tired of expecting anything in particular when the road, turning suddenly, dipped downward along the side of a deep ravine with a river at the bottom.\\" <br />\\"The most unpleasant feature of mid-winter is not its darkness... more unpleasant still, perhaps, is that it should never grow dark enough for one to forget the endlessness of which it is a symbol; the endlessness that in reality is akin to nothing but justice itself; which fills the world, like justice, and like justice is inexorable. Mid-winter and justice are two sisters; one realizes best of all in the spring, when the sun shines, that they were both evil. Today is the shortest day. Perhaps those who manage to survive this day will be safe, let us hope so.\\" <br />How does one begin to describe or, worse yet, review a novel that is regarded as an epic... that is a part of the Icelandic national consciousness and is the most famous contemporary Icelandic piece of literature, not to add that it was a Nobel winner? I am certainly not in any position to offer any sort of critical analysis of something so well-respected (unless of course I thought that all the respect and praise of the novel for the last half century was undeserved. I might be entitled to that dissenting opinion, but I cannot say that I have such an opinion. My opinion of this novel is that it is a masterpiece). The harshness of life in Iceland throughout the ages is discussed in grueling detail in this novel, and at times the prose does go on at length about the perils of being a sheep farmer (\\"Sheep had been a greater curse to the Icelandic nation than foxes and tapeworms put together. `Sheeps clothing disguises a ferocious wolf...; people run after sheep alltheir lives long and never find them. Such is the lesson we may learn from the parting that oppresses us today.'\\" and later in the novel, \\"it was growing daily more and more obvious that the country's worst enemy was no longer the fox, the country's worst enemy was the sheep.\\") The protagonist of Independent People, Bjartur of the Summerhouses, is a stubborn and crusty and, above all, independent man. He is resistant to change and never sees fit to keep abreast of the modern times or news of the day. You as a reader may not feel a great amount of sympathy for him and some of his hard-headed and even cruel ways. You will likely respect him for the strength of his convictions, and maybe even laugh sometimes. (I laughed at the following passage, for example: \\"And if Bjartur heard them complaining about the damp, he would reply that it was pretty miserable wretches that minded at all whether they were wet or dry. He could not understand why such people had been born. `It's nothing but damned eccentricity to want to be dry,' he would say, `I've been wet more than half my life and never been a whit worse for it.'\\")<br />Bjartur (which is an Icelandic word meaning \\"bright\\" or \\"shining\\") buys a farm and calls it \\"Summerhouses\\". The farm he purchases is said to be cursed by the spirit of Gunnvor, a woman who apparently lived there centuries before and had killed and eaten people. Bjartur was not a superstitious man and disregarded the legends and began his life at the Summerhouses, married a woman named Rosa, and started farming. (The superstitions about Gunnvor and the curse on Summerhouses are a good contrast for the juxtaposition in Iceland between Christianity and more traditional nature religions/worship. The minister embodies many of the contradictions that are felt throughout the novel, \\"In his contradictions he was as much an enigma as the country itself: a religious devotee out of spite at the soullnessness of men who thought of nothing but dogs and sheep, a scientific breeder of sheep because of his contempt for sheep, the Icelandic pastor of a thousand years' folk stories...\\" This struggle between Christianity and the traditional forms of worship also comes into play in the following passage, with the Bailiff speaking, \\"I've always kept my Christianity before me, and I demand that others also should have the Christianity necessary to bring them within the rule of law. I've always had a picture of Christ hanging in my room, a picture that was left me by my mother.\\" (\\"Yes, and one of the Russian czar, too,\\" interposed Bjartur)-\\"yes, one of the Russian czar is a highly respected sovereign who has always ruled his subjects well, and that they at least aren't a gang of stubborn heathens who call ghosts and monsters down upon their heads the way you do.\\")	2001-01-25

It is almost mystical and mysterious, and you think \\"south of the border\\" must be an amazing place. The disappointment and disillusionment you must feel when you reach adulthood and realise the song is just talking about Mexico shatters any illusions you may have had in those innocent days of childhood. This is the case with the narrator of the story, who narrates a seemingly simple story of unrequited love that began with childhood friendship and afternoons listening to various music that formed the soundtrack for the rest of his life. The story is deceptive in its straightforward quality: very under-the-radar, so to speak. The narrator, Hajime, a Japanese man who owns successful jazz clubs outside of Tokyo, weaves a tale that can either be interpreted on its surface level... a love story, complete with loss and tragedy. Or it can be delved into more deeply. \\"South of the Border\\" certainly has its obvious double entendre. It can signal the beginning of a sexual awakening (it is no coincidence, either, that the main character is named Hajime-which means \\"beginning\\"). Also for the children, narrator and his friend Shimamoto, (we only ever learn her last name, which is another indicator of the wall that she kept up to shield herself from the outside world) \\"South of the Border\\" was something far off, exotic and unattainable. In a sense, this is exactly how Hajime felt about Shimamoto. He felt he lost her after they lost contact, and that love could never be equalled. Later when he discovered what \\"South of the Border\\" meant he felt like he had been deceived. <br />The book is filled with imagery of this sort that can conjure up many deeper meanings than are obvious. The narrator tells of his life and girlfriends he has had andhow he has hurt some of them, one of them irreparably. In his life, he always returns to thoughts of Shimamoto and to the girlfriend he hurt (Izumi). Meanwhile, his life goes on. He finds that he has very little motivation for anything, and after college becomes a textbook editor, which he hates. He meets his wife, Yukiko, when he is 30, and Yukiko's father takes a liking to Hajime, which is fortuitous in that it allows him to alter the path of his professional life and open the jazz bars... but this leads to a great deal of destruction in his personal life. Shimamoto reappears after not having seen Hajime since they were young teenagers. Eventually they confess that they are still in love with one another, although Shimamoto is quite different and very mysterious. Shimamoto enters and leaves Hajime's life easily, and the reader never learns the details of her alternate life. You only discover that she has effectively turned Hajime's life upside down. <br />\\"Everyone just keeps on disappearing. Some things just vanish, like they were cut away. Others fade slowly into the mist. And all that remains is a desert.\\" <br />This is a splendidly crafted novel and can appeal to the reader on many levels. (And Hajime's first girlfriend's father is a Japanese Communist dentist tennis fanatic who named the family dog Karl after Karl Marx. You will probably never see such an inventive character again in your life!)	2001-01-25

I am used to a gentler Murakami style, and this book did not adhere to that formula, which only attests to Murakami's genius, even if this book was not as appealing to me personally. The book seems to take a cue from the fantasy realm populated by books such as Douglas Adams' Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy. At times the book was so far outside the lines of reality and so far into technological psychobabble and artful, creative meanderings of the writer's mind that it is positively confusing to decipher. It was indeed quite thought-provoking and at times quite vivid in creating certain feelings in the reader (for example, claustrophobia and fear in the section when the main character is wandering through underground caves with another person). The book can be fascinating, technical, murky, strange, engaging, and eccentric all at once. The use of the word \\"wonderland\\" in the title is quite fitting. Interestingly, the book points out some very obvious things which we never think about. For example, the main character is part of a life, an organization, that the average citizen knows nothing about. His life is completely a mystery, and even if he were to describe it to someone they would find him crazy. It illustrates how little we really know about other people and how cut off from experience we are. In our society we are able to see news 24 hours a day and are content thinking that we have all the facts, when in fact, we never know what is propaganda if we never seek out alternative media sources. For example. An interesting point to make is that this book is like reading two separate books. In alternating chapters, two stories are told, although one appears to be the everyday life of the narrator and the alternate chapters are of a town that is actually the narrator's unconscious mind. Because this book was a bit confusing I am not certain that my interpretation is correct nor that it is the only interpretation. In fact, I am sure that many different people could come up with infinite interpretations. As a result of experiments conducted on the narrator without his knowledge, it is clear that he will lose his conscious mind, as he knows it, and live in a world of his own creation in his mind. New memories are created by some sort of implants in his mind that bridge different parts of his brain (natural and implanted), creating a parallel world he will come to live in. It is not clear if he literally lives or dies. But it does not matter. This is a carefully crafted work that requires thought.	2001-01-25

To those unfamiliar with the works of Howard Zinn or Noam Chomsky this book may startle you with its radical, left-wing agenda and approach to history, which clearly illustrates that history is highly subjective and selective. \\"But most histories understate revolt, overemphasize statesmanship, and thus encourage impotency among citizens.\\" For \\"old hands\\" at the more \\"subversive\\" interpretive literature on history and society, this is an exhaustive and required survey of U.S. history through present day. <br />I attended the Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, where there are no grades, only written evaluations. A highly concentrated liberal population of students and faculty alike combine to create an academic environment in which you would be almost guaranteed to find this tome on any list of required readings in any academic program. The problem with the school (and at times in the book) is that divergent opinions and questioning are sometimes not tolerated. <br />\\"The American system is the most ingenious system of control in world history. With a country so rich in natural resources, talent, and labor power the system can afford to distribute just enough wealth to just enough people to limit discontent to a troublesome minority. It is a country so powerful, so big, so pleasing to so many of its citizens that it can afford to give freedom of dissent to the small number who are not pleased.\\" \\"There is no system of control with more openings, apertures, leeways, flexibilities, rewards for the chosen, winning tickets in lotteries. There is none that disperses its controls more complexly through the voting system, the work situation, the church, the family, the school, the mass media-none more successfulin mollifying opposition with reforms, isolating people from one another, creating patriotic loyalty.\\" <br />An interesting point Zinn makes starts with his examination of post-Civil War treatment of blacks in the U.S. and the growth of economic problems that caused not only African-Americans to suffer but also poor whites. \\"W.E.B. Du Bois saw the late 19th century betrayal of the Negro as part of a larger happening in the United States, something happening not only to poor blacks but to poor whites.; ...DuBois saw this new capitalism as part of a process of exploitation and bribery taking place in all the \\"civilised\\" countries of the world...;...Was DuBois right-that in the growth of American capitalism, before and after the Civil War, whites as well as blacks were in some sense becoming slaves?\\" <br />This point is taken up again late in the book, when Zinn discusses the lack of real political choices, after having examined the fact that both major parties generally do not reflect the will of the people and usually cater to big business in the end, not to their constituents. Zinn writes, \\"All of us have become hostages in the new conditions of doomsday technology, runaway economics, global poisoning, uncontainable war.\\" His points are timely, considering our recent electoral problems, and the notion that Americans have not really had a choice in who governs. <br />The book is painstakingly detailed and surveys major events in U.S. history from an entirely fresh perspective (fresh for the majority of American people). At times shocking and horrifying, A People's History is eye-opening and instructs you to exercise skepticism. Everything is not always as it appears. You will not regret the investment of time reading this lengthy book. It will either open a whole new world of information to you or confirm suspicions you perhaps already had. Like Chomsky, Zinn puts facts out for you to examine. You're free to believe or refute as your like, but he offers a perspectivethat average people (not history scholars or academics) are unlikely to gain elsewhere.	2001-01-18

Reis is returning to his native Lisboa after more than a decade of absence, living in Brasil practicing medicine. This is a fascinating character portrait, brilliantly characteristic of Saramago and consistent with his style. Yes, Saramago has a consistent style, but this is not to say in any way that he writes and rewrites the same book. No, each of his stories has its own momentum, its own plot and its own rich texture. The reader will definitely get a different feeling from each of Saramago's offerings. Reis is not the best of Saramago's work, but the work as a whole is quite compelling. It was not a book that I could sit down and read straight through. The pace of the book lent itself well to being a bedside-table book, which I would read from once every two or three evenings before falling asleep. <br />Saramago again uses his novel to probe the complexities of language and philosophy, \\"Why is it that words often make use of us, we see them approach menacingly, like an irresistible abyss, yet are unable to ward them off and end up saying precisely what we did not wish to say.\\" And later in the novel, he observes, \\"But what kind of attention, he could be telling the truth, he could be telling a lie, such is the inadequacy, the built-in duplicity of words. A word lies. With the same word one can speak the truth. We are not what we say, we are true only if others believe us.\\" <br />Throughout the novel, Reis engages in conversation with the deceased poet/writer Fernando Pessoa, which is a frequent and fantastic element to this novel, which foreshadows Reis's impending demise. In one scene, Pessoa is growing increasingly  annoyed because Reis is still on the side of the living-the dialogue that follows is quite typical of Saramago's writing style: Pessoa: \\"It is difficult for one who is alive to understand the dead.\\" Reis: \\"I suspect that it is just as difficult for a dead man to understand the living.\\" P: \\"The dead man has the advantage of having been alive, he is familiar with the things of this world and of the other world, too, whereas the living are incapable of learning the one fundamental truth and profiting from it.\\"  R:\\" What truth is that?\\" P: \\"That one must die.\\" R:\\" Those of us who are alive know that we will die.\\" P: \\"You don't know it, no one knows it, just as I didn't when I was alive, what we do know without a shadow of a doubt is that others die.\\" <br />And later, more thoughts on the nature of death are posed, \\"Death is a strange thing, stranger still when you see it from the shore where I am standing and suddenly realise that no two deaths are alike, to be dead is not the same for everyone, in some cases a man takes with him all life's burdens.\\" <br />Naturally there are many characters and events that populate the book, but these are generally secondary to Saramago's tales. Reis is the focus here, and Reis is a thoughtful, contemplative man. \\"Ricardo Reis takes stock of his own ambitions and concludes that he craves nothing, that he is content to watch the river and the passing ships, the mountains, and the peace that reigns there, yet he feels no happiness inside him...\\" As with all of Saramago's work, which can be sometimes burdensome and challenging to read, I highly recommend that you accept the challenge.	2001-01-17

Somehow I expected it to be more sweeping, to be more engaging, and in reality it was not. The book, and the author's feelings about his native Russia, are summed up in a passage in the book which reads, \\"Russia, like a bear after a long winter, was awakening within me. A pitiless, beautiful, absurd, unique Russia. A Russia pitted against the rest of the world by its somber destiny.\\" My disappointment in the book overall is not a recommendation against the book. It simply serves to point out that this book, like many others, is not perfect. Makine, though, is a gifted writer with a keen eye for detail. He writes eloquently of the \\"unique Russia\\" which is so foreign to non-Russians. He illustrates starkly that non-Russians are not, no matter how well-versed on Russian history, literature, language, going to fully understand Russia and \\"Russianness\\". However, he lends insight to those of us who might like to try. By recounting his Siberian youth in this semi-autobiographical account Makine provides a coming-of-age tale and new cultural perspectives. Another interesting point about this book is Makine's own struggle to come to terms with being Russian, leaving Russia and becoming French, \\"Yes, if I had occasion to weep at the death of my parents, it was because I felt Russian. And the French graft in my heart began, at times, to give me great pain.\\" <br />The book was originally written in French, and as yet, I have not read the original French. The translation, however, is a worthwhile glimpse into Makine's debut work.	2001-01-17

I cannot deny that The History of... is a well-crafted and, well, for lack of better diction, interesting book. It is. I read it with interest and sometimes amusement. The main character is charming, and you learn that his career as an editor has been long, distinguished and honorable (if indeed an editor can be called \\"honorable\\"). In his entire career he has never abused his position, but one day, as you will read, he does... and his liberty changes everything. Indeed Saramago raises interesting questions with this concept... when you change one single word, even the smallest of words, the entire meaning of everything can be changed. Saramago, naturally, delves more deeply into this subject in the book than I will here, but I think the book is worth reading simply for the merits of Saramago's verbal and philosophical meanderings.	2001-01-17

I was wandering a bookstore in Reykjavik looking for something new and interesting. I figure that most of the time the Nobel committee selects authors for an outstanding body of work, so I trust their judgment. Having just finished read the majority of Nadine Gordimer's works, I was seeking a fresh voice, but something equally as intelligent and entertaining. The Stone Raft seemed a promising title with a most ridiculous and fantastic premise-Spain and Portugal breaking off the European continent and floating off into the Atlantic. I had not seen something this promising in ages. I bought The Stone Raft and The History of the Siege of Lisbon at the same time, and I immediately delved into The Stone Raft. It was slow going at first, and I could feel a great wave of disappointment creep over me because this was really not as interesting as I anticipated... but WAIT! Within 20 or 30 pages, I was riveted. I am not sure what transformation took place in the course of those pages, but suddenly this was a book I could not put down. I didn't put it down again until I finished it. <br />Other people have provided plot synapses and analysis, so I won't bore you with further repetition on that subject. All you need to know is that Saramago is one of the most brilliant writers alive, this is one of the most creative books of the 20th century, and Saramago's ability to pose questions that seem at once quite obvious but at the same time quite obscure is uncanny. Saramago's brilliance for observing minutiae in people's daily lives and behaviour is remarkable, and his characters are unforgettable and lively. You will never regret making the time to read this book.	2001-01-17

I asked him, \\"What is good to read then?\\" Which is when he told us about Bohumil Hrabal, and the most brilliant book he (Kaspar) had ever read, I Served the King of England. He tried to describe it, but found it impossible because it was too filled with highly nuanced and some very uniquely Czech things. He recommended it, although he qualified his recommendations with many disclaimers: I won't really understand its meaning and depth because I am American. No one but a Czech can understand the significance of this work. Also, while he was at it, he had to let me know that it is impossible as a foreigner to try to learn the Czech language because it is impossible. Expats try it all the time, he assured me, but it is impossible. No, Kaspar impatiently but proudly insists, it does not matter if you have a background in Slavic languages, Czech is unique and only Czechs will truly master it. <br />Be that as it may, I found a copy of I Served... in a bookshop in Iceland after the bus tour was over. There were not any English language copies to be found in Prague (then again, I only had a few days to check, and I was too busy having a whirlwind two-day affair with a man from Spain who spoke nary a word of English). Be sure, of course, that I would not be sopresumptuous as to purchase a copy of this magnificent treasure of modern Czech literature in its native language because it is a language which would naturally only confound me. I am American, after all. I barely know English! <br />With this glowing recommendation and pile of books I procured for late night reading on a friend's floor (my makeshift bed) in Reykjavik, I read I Served the King of England in one night, and I loved it. It was, as Kaspar promised, a brilliant book. I loved the irreverent and direct style of Hrabal's writing. I suspect that you will too. It is not a book filled with intricacies nor plots and subplots and it is not clogged with millions of characters. It is a simple book, but in its simplicity transcends the need for a lot of extra \\"stuff\\". (There is that expected American eloquence again!) I can say that at the end of the book, the narrator is almost like a hermit, living with his dog. If I am not mistaken (it has been almost 2 years since I read the book) the dog actually goes out and gets supplies for the narrator. Eventually the townspeople miss the narrator so much that they go to extraordinary lengths to make him come out of hiding, even (sadly!) killing the narrator's beloved and necessary dog. Definitely read this book if you can find it.	2001-01-17

The shortage of Icelandic learning materials will naturally guide an eager learner to this book, and the book is fine and serves a purpose. Compared with some of the other materials that are widely available this book is among the best. I would suggest, however, some texts and materials that are available in Iceland and which are used in the degree program for Icelandic language designed for foreigners at the University of Iceland (mostly written by U of Iceland faculty and published by the university). One book that is good for basics and provides explanatory information is Icelandic for Beginners by Stanislaw Jan Bartoszek and Anh-Dao Tran. It comes with a cassette and is a great place to start learning Icelandic.  In the meantime, however, Glendening's efforts are to be applauded. The book provides a lot of information but just is not very accessible. One bonus, though, if you can get past the layout of the book, is that it is affordable, unlike a lot of materials.	2000-09-28

Yugoslavia was a special case, and Drakulic had  special things to say. She is a keenly perceptive and accessible writer  with a gift for giving detail and lending insight into things people from  outside Yugoslavia could not understand. However, Drakulic is not a fiction  writer. This book is an improvement from her effort in Marble Skin, but I  find that her fiction is pretentious-trying-not-to-be-pretentious,  far-fetched (and these are not supposed to be fantasy or sci-fi novels),  and completely devoid of anything really original. Drakulic goes for shock  value, but her choices are obvious and not at all engaging. <br />Don´t waste  your time.	2000-09-14

I can say that this book was incredibly moving with  its vivid descriptions of Sarajevo as it once was and as it was during the  war. Sarajevo as a city was a victim, and its people were onlookers  suffering along with the city. The book is surprising in that it tells the  story of the city from the perspective of a resident. One would expect a  book of this type (and the time frame in which is was written) to be more a  memoir about the way of life that was lost or about the horrors of war. No,  the book is more an elegy for the city of Sarajevo and a voice of hope for  what the city could be again. <br />This is one of the books that is not  easily described but must be read and absorbed personally to fully  appreciate its craft.	2000-09-14

I read it over a year ago in  one night lying awake sleeping on a friend´s floor in Reykjavik, Iceland.  (I was a proud Seattle resident back then.) I have read a plethora of  contemporary Japanese literature, and a lot of it takes on the surreal,  disconnected, and often crazy tone of Murakami´s work, but Murakami is the  master. I bought this book in Iceland, where books are a million times more  expensive as in America, so that says something. When I wander the  bookstores of Iceland now that I live here, I contemplate buying other  books of his (on impulse), but it is more of a value to order books via  Amazon from here... but I digress. I mean to say that Haruki Murakami´s  work is worth the money you pay for it. As one of the reviewers on the book  jacket stated, the book &quot;takes a baseball bat to your brain.&quot; And  it does. <br />As other reviewers/readers have said, you will not even notice  the length of this book. It flies past with momentum. Today, a year later,  I am still thinking about it. <br />Toru Okada seems to be wandering through  his life, and instead of him making things happen, usually things happen to  him. The plot of the story and various analyses of it are well documented  here in these reviews. I won´t be repetitive. I will simply say that this  is a FINE work (by &quot;fine&quot; I do not mean the lacklustre &quot;how  are you? I´m fine...&quot; sort of definition.)	2000-09-12

I have defended her writing to those who have  only dabbled in one or two works and form opinions. Gordimer´s works are  much more complex than one can dissect in one reading of a particularly  book or in a reading of only one of her books. <br />Burger´s Daughter was  surprising, as all of Gordimer´s works are. Gordimer has mastered the art  of voice and gives her characters complex lives and thoughts without  resorting to or relying on cliché or expectation. In Burger´s Daughter, the  protagonist lives a life that was created for her before she was even born.  Her father´s political activism created circumstances into which she would  be born and in which she would be expected to live, much as royalty is born  and expected to follow in the monarchy´s traditions. <br />The book traces  Burger´s daughter through her literal and figurative explorations to find  her own voice, which can be the most difficult thing one can do in life,  particularly when overshadowed by the voices of everyone around you. This  work is quite subtle and although surprising (only because I am always  amazed that someone has such talent for breathing life into a page) it is  very typical Gordimer. Well worth the time to read it.	2000-09-12
US	52714831	R2LED9O1QIRIWJ	0847680878	33633134	A Passion for Justice: Emotions and the Origins of the Social Contract (Camden Fifth Series; 5)	Books	3	7	9	N	N	What is Justice?	While I found this book to be repetitive in nature, its points were well-argued (passionately, no less) in favour of the intrinsic goodness of  people.  It is possible to reiterate what the book offers mostly by quoting  the book directly, as Solomon phrased things in the best way. Thematically,  the point that is pounded into the reader's head again and again is, \\"That  theme is, again, that justice is not a utopian plan for the perfect society  but a personal sense of individual and collective fellow-feeling and  responsibility.  It is not an abstract theoretical ideal but a  constellation of feelings and a perfectly ordinary virtue of character, \\"  (Solomon, 3.)  This point is made again in several places, thereby making  it difficult to miss the point!  What Solomon might have been able to  say in simply the introduction he expounds upon over the course of an  entire book. Granted, many details are revealed that weave a web about the  history and processes of justice, but the introduction would suffice. He  states the theme of the book directly and explicitly, \\"Thus the theme of  this book is that justice is and must be first of all a matter of personal  concern and an individual virtue, not just a quality of anonymous  institutions, systems and governments,\\" (Solomon, 15.)  Solomon goes on to  embellish his theme, \\"Accordingly, the idea to be defended here is that  justice is basically not an ideal state or a scheme for the way of the  world or a perfect government system, but rather the way that one lives,  the way that one feels, the way that one acts and responds and seeks out  situations in everyday life,\\" (Solomon, 15.)  Solomon uses the phrase \\"the  idea to be defended.\\" It does not seem that there is something that  substantive to defend. Perhaps I take his assertions for granted as being  \\"true\\" because I lean toward more liberal, humanistic perceptions of  justice and the elements that make up \\"justice.\\" Perhaps it is indeed an  issue to be defended; somehow, it seems it might have been defended more  succinctly.  Solomon is more the expert of issues of justice than I am.  He writes, \\"Justice claims are always contextual and presuppose a local set  of conditions and considerations. Where there are no clear criteria, which  is often the case when contexts collide or overlap, the language of justice  is not (as the philosophers hope) a vehicle for rational calculation but a  medium of persuasion,\\" (Solomon, 18.) A disclaimer, it seems, to  conceptualising justice.  There are subtle differences and nuances to  the way the theme is presented. This approach reiterates the theme  incessantly but at the same time provides a thought provoking vehicle.  For  example, \\"But the most striking and immediate result of any such conception  of justice is that it is always at a distance, something other, a state to  be hoped for, prayed for, or perhaps desperately worked for, but not as  such something already \\"in us,\\" something very much our own...;... Justice  will be done, we hope, but not by us,\\" (Solomon, 6.) Here Solomon urges  thought of the fact that a sense of justice is intrinsic but is perceived  otherwise by most people. The overall theme also captures this idea but  expands it and generalizes it to encompass a more proactive approach. The  general theme has more \\"the way things should be\\" overtones than do the  ideas that build the theme.  A prime example of this is Solomon's own  question, \\"But why? Why don't we have even a vocabulary of goodness,  honour, and virtue for ordinary life?\\" (25.)  Solomon also  demonstrates how perceptions of justice are somehow confused... and how  these perceptions have changed over time. He writes, \\"One of the more  controversial aspects of my argument is the idea that \\"negative\\" emotions  such as vengefulness, outrage and resentment have an essential place in the  cultivation of justice,\\" (34.)  It seems self-evident: how could it be  otherwise? Why would people seek justice/retribution unless they somehow  felt that unjust acts had been committed against them? (Or against their  particular group? Or humanity for that matter?) Why would the development  of the justice system have become so sophisticated and more or less  inflated as it has today unless there were a great deal of emphasis placed  on the feelings (often \\"negative\\" and conflict-filled feelings) of the  \\"victim?\\" After all, \\"It is widely known that Friedrich Nietzsche argued at  length that resentment is the main ingredient in much of what we call  morality,\\" (Solomon, 35.) Resentment, it seems, often leads the human heart  to seek justice (at least by contemporary societal standards.) In the past,  as the book points out, standards of justice differed. Particularly  illuminating was the description of how atrocious it seems by today's  standards is this concept of \\"an eye for an eye,\\" when in fact this was  quite just, urging equality rather than all out vengeance. \\"Vengeance is an  inescapable part of our psychology, perhaps it is even an instinct,\\"  (Solomon, 40.) As humans we desire revenge, but we couple our negative  feelings, often with more positive ones. For instance, \\"It is our  hardheartedness, not our compassion, that is unnatural. The sameness of the  homeless stirs our sympathies, but it also stimulates our defences,\\"  (Solomon, 49.)  Another key point I found compelling was that of  \\"reciprocal altruism\\" in chapter 3.  \\"What is natural about us? To be sure,  we are not born with a sense of natural rights or universal equality or  conceptions of reward and punishment. These we learn, in various ways, as  we grow up in one society or another. Nor are virtually any of our passions  \\"born into\\" us in the strong sense advocated by traditional theorists of  human nature...; What is natural in us, I want to argue, is neither,  self-interest nor global benevolence but reciprocity,\\" (Solomon, 104.)  Actually, upon reflecting on this book (while I write) I am finding that  there was a lot more valuable information than I originally thought.  Certainly the information and ideas might have been condensed somewhat, but  overall, this book provides highly effective arguments for its points.	2000-09-01
US	52714831	R2OIIR6Z6OZIUW	0226851753	973652496	The Challenger Launch Decision: Risky Technology, Culture, and Deviance at NASA	Books	4	11	15	N	N	Glimpses into Organizational Culture	\\"Like organizations in the natural world, it seems that successful  organizations evolve appropriate structures and processes for dealing with  the challenges of their external environment\\" (Morgan, 55.) The  organizational culture of NASA, similar to the FAA (by whom I was once  employed), has its procedures. The Challenger was a casualty of  organizational culture because NASA relied so much on risk assessment and  expanding the acceptable risk thresholds to satisfy outside pressures.   NASA is a government agency, which constrains it. It is essentially a  bureaucracy. As Vaughan points out, however, \\" Clearly, the Challenger  incident does not fall into the category of corporate criminality because  NASA is not a private enterprise. But consider the following: although it  is a government organization rather than a corporate profit seeker, NASA is  subject to all the same difficulties. In order to survive in an environment  populated by competitors, suppliers, customers and controllers, all  organizations must compete for scarce resources-- regardless of their size,  wealth, age, experience or previous record\\" (Vaughan, 35.)  Results are  expected in return for funding. NASA is an agency that constantly must  justify its existence. How can this not influence the entire organizational  culture as well as strategic planning? Organizational culture became  focused on existence; continuing successful spaceflight missions; good  press; satisfying external expectations; not necessarily meeting safety  requirements. (It appears after the fact that there was mismanagement and  deviant decisionmaking or that NASA as an agency had rules to circumvent  their own rules in order to alter or expand the concept of acceptable risk,  but this was just a superficial look at NASA's organizational culture.)  (Vaughan, 58.)   When external forces do not understand fully the  organizational culture of a given agency , it can also cause problems.  Vaughan's book cites NASA policy-- allof which seemed to be glossed over  and misunderstood by those outside of NASA. This is quite similar to the  way operations are conducted at the FAA.   Risk analysis, safety and  the construction of risk are all issues that NASA and the FAA take  seriously. In the case of NASA, there are misunderstandings and  misconceptions about NASA's internal culture... for example, the misnomer  of \\"launch constraint.\\" (Vaughan, 167.) As well, there are misconceptions  of the \\"normalization of deviance.\\" In technical cultures it is difficult  enough for the layman to understand the basic principles of the internal  workings let alone the intricacies and rationale behind their  decisionmaking and ultimately their construction of acceptable risk.  On  page 148-9, Vaughan illustrates how even the technical minds at work cannot  calculate for everything, \\"...many decisions about risky technology are  most accurately described as `decisionmaking under ignorance' because from  a technical standpoint all conditions can never be known.\\" Vaughan also  writes, \\"The following exchange epitomizes that contrast, showing how  cultural meanings shaped engineers' definition of the situation...\\" (188.)  In the case of the Challenger, and the incremental glimpses into the  problems that the engineers had (Vaughan, 149),  \\"Spaceflight continued  because each time an anomaly occurred they believed they understood the  cause and the limits of the phenomena they were seeing\\" (Vaughan, 147.)    Two excellent illustrations of the failure of organizational culture as it  relates to the Challenger are: \\"Because their actions conformed to these  environmental contingencies the decisions they made were legitimate,  acceptable, and not deviant, in their view. In the NASA culture, flying  with known flaws was not deviant\\" (Vaughan, 114.) The second illustration  of this failure is, \\" We are reminded of how repetition, seemingly small  choices, and the banality of daily decisions in organizational life--indeed, in most social life-- can camouflage from the participants a  cumulative directionality that too often is discernible only in hindsight\\"  (Vaughan, 119.) This is a perfect complement to Morgan's cautioning that  too often organizational metaphor/culture can be blinding to the point that  the big picture is ignored. This organizational \\"cultural immersion\\" ends  up being a hindrance (and often a fatal, tragic one as in the case with the  Challenger.)	2000-09-01
US	52714831	R2MWHH46LNZUCA	0805028757	77947102	Masters of Illusion: The World Bank and the Poverty of Nations	Books	4	4	6	N	N	Failure	The World Bank has not lived up to its own goals and expectations. It had many lofty and laudable goals, but it also had differing directives in its history. The Bank existed on its principles of expectation and intention,  not on reality, not on seeing things the way they really were  (255-6.)<br />&quot;The Bank's founders envisioned a rosy picture of a future  in which its loans would bring economic growth to its borrowers, making  their citizens prosperous and increasing world trade,  thus reinforcing  global prosperity, strengthening the bonds  between nations, and creating  the climate for a lasting peace.  That this picture has not materializes is  due both to the false assumptions on which the Bank was established and to  the structure of the Bank itself. Perhaps the key assumption underlying the  Bank's creation was that there was a condition called underdevelopment and  that virtually every country in Asia, Africa and Latin America suffered  from it&quot; (333.) <br /> The World Bank seems always to have been an  organization that looks good on paper; but is quite bad in practice (25.)  Many of the World Bank's calculations and plans have been overly optimistic  and not investigated thoroughly enough (17.) The World Bank has not been an  innovator, but has instead been trying to move along with the status quo  (234-5.) In fact the World Bank has been a highly bureaucratic  organization, full of red tape, some public embarrassment, and many  misguided steps. As said, The World Bank appears highly effective on paper  and in plans; in practice, the World Bank leaves a lot to be desired.  Basically the World bank has suffered from its slow start as an  organization and a lack of continuity in Bank policy. It has also suffered  because it bends rules, is susceptible to despots (206-12), and has fallen  prey to lending to nations with corrupt governments.   Whatever the  stated mission of the Bank, poverty is more widespread; the gap between  rich and poor is greater. Where the Bank has intervened, in many cases, the  quality of life and environment have been  compromised. The Bank  historically has encountered problems learning from its own mistakes. The  Bank's central focus has been based on a set of assumptions it has made  about poor countries. \\"The Bank was assuming that poor countries cannot  modernize without money from abroad.\\" This unresearched assumption has led  directly to the accumulation of debt and loss of sovereignty for many of  the poor nations in the world.  Development was a key concept in the  founding of the World Bank and the IMF. In hindsight, however, it is easy  to ask, \\"What kind of development?\\" When the Bank was founded, development  consisted largely of dams and other high scale projects that were thought  to technologically advance nations and benefit nations overall with easier  and cheaper access to electricity, irrigation, regulation of flood  waters... meanwhile, there were social and environmental impacts to  consider. The World Bank did not employ an environmental factors office  until  the 1970s. Even then, projects were funded which did not demonstrate  plans to account for people displaced from their homes or for sometimes  catastrophic, adverse environmental impacts.  This is reminiscent of the  book Northwest Passage in which the author describes the damming of the  Columbia River. At first it provided economic prosperity, cheap and  abundant electricity and jobs in a time when jobs were needed. In time, the  environmental and social impacts were felt. Native American tribes who had  centered their lives, cultures and livelihoods around the river were left  with nothing; the river itself was a shadow of what it was; the salmon  population rapidly died out because they could not make it back upstream to  spawn, and Hanford Nuclear Site is also along the river and could  potentially contaminate the river. The river has been important to  commerce, but at what cost?    Is this trulydevelopment? (Especially  in the \\"Third World\\"?) Some would argue, of course, that this was  exploitation of a poor nation for the benefit of the industrialized rich  nations. At the expense of the impoverished people the World Bank had  concluded it would protect. As well, the expense to the overall quality of  the environment would merely deplete resources and affect the entire world  adversely (eventually.) These considerations were not usually even  secondary or even tertiary concerns in reality. Once the Bank funded a  project, they did not conduct follow-up studies to see how the funds were  used, if the planned reforms or projects had been implemented, or how  appropriately the funds had been applied. They simply loaned the money. It  seems that \\"development\\" had multiple meanings; none of them necessarily  positive.   In the early days of the Bank, all projects' feasibility  was closely examined; however, in time, in the McNamara era, the emphasis  was placed on making loans. In what seems like a fast-food approach to  lending, McNamara urged the Bank to loan as much as possible. He felt that  the more money was loaned, the better off the poor nations would be; the  better able they would be to deal with their poverty problems. Of course,  his theories were proven wrong, and ultimately the Bank failed not only in  alleviating poverty in the nations that borrowed. Instead, the Bank set a  precedent of loaning unprecedented amounts of money without even  researching the feasibility of the programs they were supposed to study.  Granted, the Bank has faced several problems with attracting suitable  borrowers, so they have been forced to bend their conditions somewhat in  order to accommodate more borrowers as well as to justify their own  existence as an organization (92,98-101.) McNamara particularly violated  the restrictions of the Articles of Agreement, loaning more and more money,  even to socialist nations. These facts were a major departure from previousBank policy. This striking departure from the norm broke the status quo on  the lending side, but did it do anything to expand the development of poor  countries? Did it do anything to alleviate poverty? These were McNamara's  stated goals; ultimately these were supposed to be the goals of the Bank as  well, but in fact, these were just the goals of the director of the Bank at  the time. Before McNamara, several directors were to oversee operations of  the Bank; each with his own policies.   Another way in which the Bank  has deviated from its original goal is that it has not helped the people  who live with poverty everyday. Eugene Black, the Bank's first long-term  president, stated that the Bank is not biased, merely there to help. The  Bank often claims to be apolitical, but this could not be further from the  truth. The Bank feels it has the right and the responsibility to influence  the domestic affairs of its borrowers; this somehow guarantees the money  they have lent, perhaps (193.) However, it has been said that the Bank has  been too involved in the structural, internal problems of countries (60.)  The Bank was distrustful of local knowledge, \\"It was an article of faith to  Bank staffers that only highly educated specialists has the skills and the  knowledge needed to guide developing countries into the future. The  trial-and-error method, the common wisdom that had worked for centuries in  the backwaters of Africa and Asia, would not suffice in the postwar world.  By translating complex and messy real-life problems into numerical terms  that could be broken down and analyzed, the Bank's Washington experts could  formulate solutions to problems in countries they hardly knew\\" (61.) This  is a key notion. How can the World Bank administer programs and make  decisions for the economies and programs of countries of which they have  little or no knowledge?  This has a great deal to do with bureaucratic and  political problems. Who is hired and who conducts the Bank's affairs is a  matter of politics, in fact.   In the World Bank people are hired and  appointed because of their connections or because of their impressive  educational backgrounds. By impressive educational backgrounds, this does  not, of course, entail international studies or development studies.  Appointees are finance or economics majors; usually people appointed to  study or oversee projects pertaining to specific countries have had no  experience with that particular country or language...The mission of the World Bank has shifted over  time; how can it adhere to its original mission (299)? Times changes;  issues change. \\"Poverty alleviation, at first seen merely as a desirable  side effect of the Bank's lending, is now the central object of its  existence\\" (2.)

Who determines what it is? More  telling, who determines when you have stumbled outside the boundaries of  reality and accepted norms? <br />Angels of the Universe tells a heartbreaking  (to echo another reviewer's sentiments) story of Paul, an Icelandic man who  slowly loses his footing in reality while giving the reader a glimpse into  Icelandic life. <br />The tale is tragic, following Paul's slow descent  further and further into himself. Nevertheless the book also illustrates  the fact that madness, or perceived madness, or depression, or any kind of  emotional or mental illness can befall anyone. Paul's friend Rognvald, who  appears to be content, living a &quot;normal&quot; life, kills himself.  Rognvald always visits Paul in Klepp Psychiatric Hospital and when Paul  tells Rognvald that he wishes Rognvald had become a psychiatrist instead of  the dentist he was, Rognvald replies, &quot;Don't you reckon it's not  enough trouble keeping yourself on the right side of the line?&quot; Paul  says that he cannot imagine anything more normal than being a wealthy  dentist, adding that there isn't room for healthy sorts of folks like  dentists at the madhouse. Rognvald replies, &quot;But just bear in mind  that the madhouse is in a lot of places.&quot;<br />What point could be made  that is more true? Many places and stations in life are places that might  just as well be asylums, and the book points out that there is illness and  pain everywhere which is ultimately what made the book realistic and  painful to read.<br />Although the book is out of print, it is available in  Iceland in Icelandic and English. A film has also been made.	2000-08-08

He challenges existing  beliefs and paradigms and refutes them, providing evidence of his  assertions. You, as the reader, are invited to read what he writes, agree  or disagree. Chomsky invites readers to question what information they are  given and exercise simple reason and skepticism in evaluating that  information.<br />The introduction to this collection of essays (and  informative interview) is excellent. It provides a basic overview of  Chomsky's philosophy (if you could call it that.) I felt that this book was  basic reading, particularly for those who are new to Chomsky's works. In  the introduction Peck writes that freedom and the process of indoctrination  go hand in hand... and in America freedoms exist &quot;within an  ideological consensus that limits debate and protects powerful interests in  ways all too similar to those in which obviously repressive societies  operate.&quot;  The entire book (and Chomsky's many other works) provide  evidence of these statements. Chomsky is meticulous in combing for details  and wants readers to release themselves from the mindlessness of taking  information (or veracity of readily available information) for granted.  Conventional media are seemingly free from having a burden of proof and  need not provide any evidence to support their claims. This is not only the  fault of media outlets. The media do what they can get away with.  Discriminating, thoughtful readers seeking information should not accept  that. <br />One of the most apt analogies Chomsky makes in the interview is  that professional sports, as an example, are one means for deflecting  attention from real and important issues. The layperson can argue and  analyse football to death and feel comfortable making his/her own analysis  of athletics. However, these same people see world affairs and politics as  out of the realm of their experience and expertise and do not even attempt  to learn about it. Naturally something is to be said for the fact that many  Americans so not have interest in these affairs and are more interested in  sports... but it is a cyclical and indoctrinated response. From a young  age, Americans are indoctrinated to focus on what their favourite team is  doing as opposed to what is happening in another part of the world. <br />An  interesting thought to ponder (at least for me), though, is that in reading  the older essays, Chomsky discussed the lack of access to unbiased  information. I wonder if this has changed or even been revolutionised by  access to electronic publications and communication and technology in  general? Or is this just wishful thinking?	2000-08-08

Unfortunately a lot of the things you learn will be misleading, &quot;americentric&quot;, or outright false. Let us not forget, as the  first customer/reviewer of the book mentioned, the countless typographical  errors, which do not lend themselves to credibility. Overall, the book  provided an interesting overview and presents a few issues that are of  note, for example, Turkey's desire to join the EU but its lack of  &quot;high profile&quot; preventing it from doing so. Also the ongoing  problems in Cyprus are described. Unfortunately Newhouse does not provide a  thorough analysis of the future/growth of the EU and completely neglects  the facts, particularly with the regard to the realities of many Eastern  and Central European countries' economic situations. One particularly  irritating problem is Newhouse's overemphasis on what the Czech Republic  predicts about itself and its future, not relying at all on unbiased fact  and &quot;hard numbers&quot;. The book depicts Czech Republic as a  progressive and dynamic economic reform success story. The number will tell  a different story. The economy of the Czech Republic is dismal. This may be  lack of research on the author's part or perhaps a question of the material  growing outdated, as the previous reviewer stated. <br />Certainly, read this  book if you are interested in the state of European affairs, but read it  skeptically and critically.	2000-07-16

However, once you  dig below the surface, one will find that the information offered, while  erudite and well written, is somewhat biased and not necessarily complete.  This, of course, is if you are really digging. <br />I wrote my thesis on  Slovenia's economy. This book did not deal directly with Slovenia, which is  unique and distinct both from the rest of Eastern Europe and from the rest  of the former Yugoslavia. However, this collection of essays portrays, for  example, worker's self-management, which has served Slovenia quite well, as  the reason Yugoslavia's economy failed. With more scrutiny it seems clear  that self-management is not flawed as a system; rather, Yugoslavia's fiscal  irresponsibility and mismanagement led to the economic chaos that ensued in  the 1980s and partially led to the collapse of the Yugoslav state in the  1990s. Fiscal mismanagement is independent of the economic system of which  it is a part. <br />I see this collection of essays as a good starting point  for gathering some background information.	2000-04-09

What is  striking about this book is, first of all, that Petrin advocates  restructuring the economy slowly, not with shock therapy that has been so  prevalent (and unsuccessful) in other parts of Eastern Europe. Petrin shows  evidence that this approach has paid off for Slovenia, which is now on the  inside track to European Union membership. The second unique aspect of  Petrin's book is that she deals with specific parts of restructuring, such  as privatization in Slovenian industry, and she prescribes specific policy  solutions for making transition successful within the existing economic  framework.	2000-04-09

Slovenia is a small, alpine country... once Communist and once a part of Yugoslavia.  I wrote my Master's thesis about Slovenia's economy,  and finding reliable, helpful and unbiased information was next to  impossible. However, I found this book, which contained a great deal of  credible information as well as avenues for further research. <br />Of  particular value for me were chapters on the economy of Slovenia, which is  highly unique among Eastern European economies in that it has remained  buoyant throughout its struggle for independence from Yugoslavia (and the  loss of the Yugoslav market) as well as economic recession in Western  Europe (Germany, Austria), Slovenia's primary economic partners.<br />The book  as a whole, however, brings together all the issues that Slovenia faces,  from the labor market, to the political system, to language and education  policy. <br />This is an excellent overview of a new nation from a variety of  viewpoints.	2000-04-09

Vojnic illustrates with  population and demographic data the regional disparities that existed among  Yugoslavia's different republics. It is easy to see how certain groups grew  to be malcontent. <br />Slovenia and Croatia, historically more prosperous and  tied more to Western Europe, enjoyed a higher standard of living, access to  the West, and superior infrastructure, and despite massive redistributive  efforts on the part of the federal Yugoslav government, attempts to improve  quality of life in the more southern regions of Yugoslavia were never quite  successful. Indeed, equality was never achieved; Slovenia and Croatia grew  tired of bankrolling failing redistribution schemes that had no results.  The federal government did not implement infrastructural improvements in  regions like Macedonia, Bosnia and Kosovo in order to make redistributive  efforts productive, so the efforts were doomed to failure. <br />This created  a great deal of tension, which of course exacerbated the nationalist  question about which Western nations hear and see so much. In fact the  problem has been universally diagnosed as being a nationalist one, when  fundamentally, the problem is more complex and is rooted in economic  inequality.<br />This book does an excellent job in proving this.	2000-04-09

Before I delved into studies of the former Yugoslavia and its economy, I did not know who he was nor did I know much  about self-management. As a subject it seemed intimidating. I am not an  economist, so I felt overwhelmed by the idea of interpreting an expert's  theoretical writing on a specialized field like self-management. <br />My  fears, however, were unfounded. Vanek's theories and writing style are  quite clear, setting forth the five basic factors of a participatory  economy immediately, also making it clear that a participatory economy is  neither a command (Soviet economy) nor capitalist. <br />This book was a bit  difficult to locate (being out of print) but if inclined to understand the  principles of self-management and how such an economic system might  function, The Participatory Economy is a fundamentally basic necessity.  <br />&quot;The true objective of the participatory firm is complex and  multidimensional. If we insisted on reducing it to a single variable, we  could not do otherwise that to say that the single variable is the degree  of satisfaction of the individuals within the collective.&quot; This sums  up what Vanek theorizes upon in great detail later in the book.	2000-04-09

What does knowledge contained within the &quot;banking&quot; form of education have to do with the reality of the oppressed? Freire's discussion of this concept brought to mind a passage in Robert Kaplan's book The Ends  of The Earth in which he discusses a school in India where people were  taught things pertinent to their lives, such as sustainable agriculture and  literacy; things that help them shape their own reality and find their  places within that reality (Freire, 75.) What is reality and who determines  it? Freire argues that reality is an always changing, transitory process  with dialogue and critical thinking at its heart. Reality is not  motionless, static, compartmentalized or predictable. Teachers make it seem  as though it is. In light of this, what is the appropriate education for  the oppressed or for anyone?<br />Freire states that education is a subversive  force. In particular education is both subversive and real when it is  liberating. &quot;Education as the exercise of domination stimulates the  credulity of students, with the ideological intent (often not perceived by  educators) of indocrinating them to adapt to the world of oppression&quot;  (59.)Whereas, &quot;Liberating education consists in acts of cognition, not  transferrals of information&quot; (60.) Most tellingly, &quot;Problem  posing education does not and cannot serve the interests of the oppressor.  No oppressive order could permit the oppressed to begin to question:  Why?&quot; (67.) Indeed, problem posing education is a form of education  which provides a method of finding meaningful problems and solutions for  those receiving the education; not a way to oppress those attempting to  gain education. The oppressors basically do not wish for the oppressed to  think for themselves; similar to how advertisers attempt to plant ideas in  the consumer's subconscious mind and give him/her notions about providing  for the ease of things being done for them, pre-made. The oppressors donot  want the oppressed to have the education that is based on experiential  learning. A pre-made education is one which will keep the oppressed  oppressed and without freedom. True education is a practice of freedom (77)  and requires that the oppressed apprehend and intervene in reality  (90.)<br />Conscientizacao is a central concept to Freire's conclusions. Ther  term is described as &quot;learning to perceive social, political, and  economic contradictions, and to take action against the oppressive elements  of reality&quot; (17.) Freire states that some perceive conscientizacao as  a danger. Conscientizacao involves knowing and naming the reality around  you and interpreting that reality with critical analysis. In a sense it is  a state of becoming fully conscious.<br />&quot;Unity and organization can  enable them to change their weakness into a transforming force with which  they can re-create the world and make it more human.&quot; This book is an  excellent work providing prescriptive evidence about how the oppressed  might go about creating their own reality to overcome oppression, seizing  education, true education, as a path to freedom.	2000-01-30

If ever a writer told things as they were, without the trappings of self-righteousness, romantic illusion or overwrought interpretation, it is Gordimer. In A World of Strangers, she is a keen reporter of the minutiae  of daily life in 1950s South Africa. Gordimer juxtaposes the dim sameness  and shallow veneer of the lavish excess of white South African society life  with the restricted and sometimes chaotic lives of the South African  blacks. Gordimer contrasts these polarities facilely, telling the story  through the eyes of her reluctant protagonist, Toby Hood, an outsider who  arrives from England to work in South Africa. Toby slides in and out of the  two realities, noticing the differences from the point of view of someone  who is never quite on the inside.<br />In a general sense, Toby embodies but  also exposes the hypocrisy of South African society: he recognizes its  injustices but accepts them nevertheless. After reading a tourist pamphlet,  Toby observes,&quot;I felt as if I were reading of another country, from  seas away. But then the country of the tourist pamphlet always is another  country, an embarrassing abstraction of the desirable that, thank God, does  not exist on this planet, where there are always ants and bad smells and  empty Coca-Cola bottles to keep the grubby finger-print of reality upon the  beautiful.&quot; Toby is conscious of the plastic unreality of the society  life but like a tourist chooses not to involve himself deeply in the  reality.<br />Gordimer's lasting impression lies in the voices of her  characters. All multidimensional and playing key roles in Toby's life. Anna  Louw, an attorney, voices parts of Toby's conscience. &quot;`What had you  expected?' she asked with patient interest. With her you felt that your  most halting utterance was given full attention .This scrutiny of the  cliches of perfunctory communication, the hit-or-miss of words inadequate  either to express or conceal, embarrassed me. Like most people, I donot  mean half of what I say, and I cannot say half of what I mean; and I do not  care to be made self-conscious of this. Much that is to be communicated is  not stated; but she was the kind of person who accepts nothing until there  has been the struggle to body it forth in words.&quot;<br />By contrast,  Toby's lover, Cecil Rowe, a vain and shallow society woman,is the gloss of  Toby's life, the one of all too human desires. He cares for her, makes love  with her, is part of her life, but even so, she is not really a part of his  because there is so much of himself that he cannot convey to her. <br />Most  important in the fabric of Toby's life is an African friend, Steven Sitole.  Sitole's refusal to abide by the rules white society dictated for him,  inspired Toby to thought. Until something unexpected happens, Toby's  thoughtful meanderings are only idle thought. Toby never reevaluated his  life and how he lived it until a tragedy forced Toby to see things in a new  way.<br />Toby's exploration of the two sides of life in South Africa as well  as the balancing act of reconciling each of them is an exploration well  worth reading. Gordimer never strays from the deft and subtle style and  analysis which characterizes all of her work.	2000-01-20

The only problem is that the volume suffers from lack of ambition. There are simply not enough poets represented nor poems representative of Serbian writing.  Otherwise, I loved this book, but I felt it needed to be more expansive.  <br />Overall this is an excellent overview.

Discovering a collection of poetry from women exclusively is a rare and  rather precious find, which makes this book a treat, even if its contents  lacked originality or creativity. <br />However, Tala Till Mig does not  disappoint with its content. Powerful and moving poetry is packed into the  pages of this (thankfully and wonderfully bilingual) edition. <br />From  Agneta Ara's self-admonishing poem &quot;Longing is betrayal of  oneself&quot; to Gurli Linden's poem of avenging betrayal and seizing  emotional freedom (&quot;I built small nests/under your heart&quot;), this  is a fresh, innovative and intricate collection of voices.
