US	52969383	RHAGAQHZEYLQI	0471696595	184847	The Making of Dr. Phil: The Straight-Talking True Story of Everyone's Favorite Therapist	Books	1	6	26	N	N	90% Tabloid Journalism	I found this book to be predominately Tabloid Journalism.  The majority of the book has the exact same tone & phrasing & spin as the rag mags.  Just like the rag mags do, the authors took a few facts, a lot of gossip & rumor then added their version of armchair psychology & spin to create a sensationalistic waste of money.  When you're done reading, it feels more like you've read a fiction novel than legitimate non-fiction.  As any good journalist knows, if you can't get enough corroborating sources, you don't run the story.  So why did they bother?  Money?	2005-05-20

I have long felt that American's are spending millions of dollars in the vain, dillusional and fear-driven attempt to ELIMINATE aging and death.  It is frustrating &amp; depressing to see so much money wasted this way.  It also seems to have created an obsession with safety at any cost.  I appreciate Sally Mann's beautifully done work on this &quot;taboo&quot; subject.	2003-11-13

And once again he delivers a great read with an excellent plot, very interesting characters and the ability to make the place &amp; time come alive in such a way that I feel I'm there.  The narrative prose is among the best I've ever read and reminds me a great deal of Louis L'Amour books and this one of the reasons I enjoy Woolard's books so much.	2001-02-27

Anna Pigeon is such a beautifully crafted  character.....independent, opinionated, tenacious and so &quot;real&quot;  that I continually have to remind myself she's a fictional character.   Liberty Falling is a wonderful book in a fantastic series that I hope goes  on for a long time to come.	1999-05-28
