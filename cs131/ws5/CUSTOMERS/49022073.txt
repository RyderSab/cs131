The setting and language are convincing; the atmosphere of the isolated mansion is made suitably creepy without resorting to Hollywood-style exaggeration.  On the other hand, the early parts of the story move slowly, and the young male narrator seems very naive.  The illustrations, while competently done, lack the dark, threatening quality that one would expect.  The cover art, though intriguing, does not seem connected to the story.	2004-07-13

Preston and Dillon are chillingly effective when they describe the brutal techniques of the PRI's &quot;perfect dictatorship,&quot; ranging from stealing ballot boxes to assassinating opponents of the regime.  They give us sympathetic brief portraits of individual democratic activists, including many women.  President Zedillo emerges as something of a hero in enabling the emergence of a more democratic political system, though even he sometimes acted in the authoritarian way of a PRI dinosaur. <br /> For the most part, Preston and Dillon tell this story in a clear and interesting way.   However, they get a bit carried away with personal vignettes, as if they wanted to include as many of their contacts as possible.  Their first-person insertions (Julia writes, Sam writes) are distracting and interrupt the flow of the narrative.  The more than five hundred pages of text could have been cut to four hundred by judicious editing.	2004-07-12

The short, concise chapters, typically two pages long, range over subjects as diverse as Sumerian cuneiform and modern standardized signs for travelers.  The author devotes particular attention to Egyptian hieroglyphs and Chinese characters, though he provides less adequate coverage of writing systems used on the Indian subcontinent.  Throughout, he emphasizes the distinction between writing systems based on sounds (alphabets) and those using symbols to represent things or concepts.  He makes the intriguing point that some written languages have mixed the two together.	2004-07-10

Topics covered include politics, economics, education, migration, and health.  The most specific and useful articles are divided into two broad categories: trends in Mexico, and Mexicans in California.  Their authors, writing in the early 1990's, foresaw many of the trends and problems that loom even larger today.  On the other hand, some material now seems dated, particularly the assumption that it would be the Mexican left that would be the most important challenge to PRI dominance.  A new version of this collection, minus the more theoretical essays, would be welcome.	2004-07-09

Most of the material in this volume is scholarly commentary on other people's work, written in a dry, wordy style.  The only conclusions that would be of interest to the general reader are that the term Toltec was used by a variety of groups in Mexico, and that the Toltec empire was less significant than its traditional ranking with the Aztecs and others would imply.	2004-07-08

Critics seized on the occasional errors or incompleteness in sweeping works like Toynbee's Study of History to attack their broad theses.  Weatherford's book about Genghis Khan is a welcome reversal of that trend.  His big picture approach synthesizes knowledge from many sources to show the astonishingly original contributions of the early Mongol empire - religious freedom, universal laws, public schools that included students from outside traditional elites, relatively free trade, paper money, even an efficient postal system.  These innovations did not survive Genghis Khan's later successors.  But eyes had been opened, and the ideas introduced by the Mongols returned to play a major role in subsequent civilizations, particularly in Europe.<br /> Yes, the Mongols were ruthless conquerors.  But Weatherford shows that many reports of slaughtered populations were wildly exaggerated.   The vast Mongol empire, while hardly a paradise of democratic government and civil rights, imposed a kind of peace for a century.  The Romans were sometimes brutal too, but the Pax Romanica imposed a similar peace on much of the Mediterranean world, enabling the growth of ideas and practices that influence us today.<br /> Understandably, Weatherford does not go into as much detail as more narrowly focused histories.  Yet there is enough to make his writing interesting as well as easy to understand.  This is one of the most readable of all Big Histories.  The few maps help to establish a geographical framework, though the pen and ink drawings really don't add to our knowledge.	2004-06-26

This book, about the search for objects beyond the traditional nine planets, gives the reader a much more realistic picture.  Davies describes how individual astronomers and small groups work through the laborious processes of searching, analyzing results, and testing theories.  There are many obstacles, including scientific rivalries and limited access to observatories.  Yet patient work has gradually revealed an enormous, previously undetected realm of icy planetoids, some of which are perturbed into the inner solar system to become comets.  <br /> Davies' writing is clear and straightforward, avoiding mathematics and explaining technical terms where necessary.  Readers with a serious interest in astronomy will find this book fascinating.  Readers whose interest is only marginal may find it too detailed and slow-moving.  Though the black and white illustrations are useful, it would have helped to have diagrams showing the scale of this vast realm all the way out to the hypothetical Oort Cloud.  Good examples can be found in the June 2004 issue of Sky and Telescope.	2004-06-25

Subsequent chapters describe recent history in Iran, Afghanistan, the Caucasus, and the Central Asian republics that once were part of the Soviet Union.  Meyer's writing is clear, lively, and well-informed; events are placed in context, and are illuminated with sharply observed detail.

This book shows how it is possible to go too far in the opposite direction.  Grinspoon often is clever in approaching his subjects. Unfortunately, in lightening his work with flip language and pop culture references, he undermines the credibility of what might have been a significant book rather than an entertainment. <br /> Lonely Planets begins with a lightweight history of thinking about the universe and the possibility that life may be scattered through it.  Grinspoon's quick reviews of planetary exploration, comparative planetology, and panspermia will be useful to those who have not studied those subjects.  He devotes a large section of the book to a discussion of what life is and how it might exist in other environments.  His slant on these issues is more original than most.  Grinspoon briefly describes SETI and the paradox associated with Fermi (he was not the first to think of it), concluding that it is  premature to rule out any present or past alien presence in our solar system.<BR> <BR> Grinspoon give us a humorous treatment of ufology, and a somewhat less whimsical approach to astrotheology.  His recognition of Russian cosmism is welcome, but his attempt to outline his own version of natural philosophy will leave most readers confused.<br /> The author intrudes too much into his subject matter through his frequent self-references. Too often, he sounds like an insider whose personal connections are as important as his ideas.  His assumption that all of his readers share the musical tastes of Baby Boomers ignores the other seventy-one per cent of the population.	2004-06-18

This one is unusual because of two elements: a homeless person who witnesses a murder, flees, and regains a respectable life, and a cell of American communists who act as if the Cold War never ended.  Sandford's descriptions of bleak northern Minnesota towns are effective, if depressing. <br />Sandford introduces a potentially interesting character in a Russian female police officer who accompanies Davenport as he investigates, but she never plays a really significant role. The morally ambiguous ending may leave some readers unsatisfied. One quibble with the series: Davenport's wealth makes him seem like someone we would never know.	2004-06-09

He avoids the details of wars and dynasties, tracking the major flows of events both with general descriptions and with selected examples and quotations that make larger points.  His first chapter is particularly effective in introducing the reader to Islam and the Arabs as they were in the seventh century, with Muslims generally aloof from Christianity while Christians saw Muslims as threatening.  <br />Fletcher challenges some common wisdom, such as Pirenne's theory that Charlemagne would not have existed without Mohammad.  His portrayal of the scholars whose translations of ancient works contributed to stimulating the Renaissance is less romantic than some other versions.  Fletcher makes clear the practicalities of being part of a minority population.  On the other hand, he responds to recent harsh criticisms of the Crusades by remarking that &quot;rebuking the past from the different moral standpoint of the present does not advance historical understanding.&quot;  <br /> In his epilogue, Fletcher writes that attitudes laid down like rocks long ago continue to shape the moral environment of Muslims and Christians.  &quot;There is a geology of human relationships,&quot; he reminds us, &quot;which it is unwise to neglect.&quot;  Unfortunately, Fletcher has been poorly served by the inadequate maps that accompany his text, as they provide no geographic detail other than coastlines.	2004-06-05

The interviews vary widely in substantive interest. Unfortunately, Swift gives us the full contents of each interview, including what he said himself.  This forces the reader to wade through a lot of marginal verbiage to get to the nuggets of thought-provoking material.

The many examples Fagan cites illustrate the vulnerability of past civilizations, particularly to drought.  The author demonstrates the wide-ranging knowledge of archaeology and anthropology we have come to expect from him.  He explains climatic science in layman's terms, with helpful maps and diagrams. <br /> Fagan wants to convince us that our present civilization also is vulnerable to climatic change.  As he puts it, we have accepted vulnerability to the big, rare disaster in exchange for a better ability to handle the smaller, more common stresses.  Unfortunately, his short concluding chapter does not develop that argument sufficiently.  A bit more prognostication would have been welcome.	2004-05-18

Unfortunately, Jones devotes most of his other chapters to more titillating subjects such as sexual behavior, erectile dysfunction, circumcision, sperm counts, paternity tests, and surrogate parenthood.

The French authors of this work go into considerable technical detail about the many topics they cover, including the celestial mechanics of artificial satellites, their orbits and ground tracks, and the trajectories of interplanetary probes.  The authors focus primarily on scientific and applications missions, with relatively little attention to manned space programs.  The world's launch vehicles and launch sites are covered thoroughly, as are earth observation satellites.

The deportation was the culmination of a seventy-year effort to transform Acadia into a Protestant, English-speaking area loyal to the British crown.  Plank uncovered an impressive array of sources, giving immediacy to some of this history.  The Mi'Kmaq Indians, often allied with the Acadians, emerge as a significant third party in this long struggle, in which periods of relative peace and cooperation alternated with military conflict and dictatorial methods.  My only criticism is that Plank has a tendency to repeat points in other words.  A few pages describing today's Acadian cultural survivals in Canada and Louisiana would have been helpful.	2004-04-27

Citing many examples of biological convergence, he argues that evolutionary outcomes are constrained, not infinite in potential number.  Sooner or later, evolution on Earth would have produced intelligent beings; if not in  primates, then from some other lineage.  While perhaps a bit overstated, this argument is a useful counter to the prevailing theory that evolution is a completely random process.  However, Morris does not extend that inevitability to other worlds.  He believes that the Earth itself may be unique because of a mixture of advantages such as a large moon. <br /> Morris argues that evolution may have purpose, that life is not just a bleak working out of statistics.  In his last chapter, he writes that &quot;there has been a resurgence of interest in the connections that might serve to reunify the scientific world with the religious instinct.&quot; This connection of evolution to religion may make some readers uncomfortable.  While Morris' writing style is generally lively, his digressions into the details of biology may leave behind non-scientist readers.	2004-04-13

His historical chapters provide a clear background for South Texas's strong cultural ties with Mexico, which have been maintained since Texas became a U.S. state.  Arreola found that, along the Texas border, no less than thirty-two counties are more than fifty per cent Mexican-American; in twenty of them, more than 70 per cent of the people are of Mexican ancestry.  The city of Laredo, a major transit point for Mexican-American trade, is more than ninety per cent Mexican-American.  Arreola provides detailed ethnic analyses of some cities, including San Antonio, showing how some are geographically divided into Mexican and Anglo areas.  He comments on the region's distinctive cultural traditions, including public celebrations and food (one of the many maps shows the line between the taco and barbecue cultures in Texas).  South Texas has been politically distinct as well, giving birth to the Chicano movement.  Some communities are setting precedents in the educational and legal uses of Spanish, in effect making it an official language.

Unfortunately, we learn less about Bruno's ideas, which covered a remarkably wide range of speculations.

Armstrong digs deep into the events of the crusading era, providing freshly perceived context for those military and religious ventures.  Her learning is impressive.<br /> Her objectivity is less so.  While Armstrong condemns religiously motivated aggression by Western European Christians, she passes much more lightly over the earlier  behavior of Islamic conquerors who also were driven by religious zeal.  At one point, she writes that &quot;It is obvious that the Muslim ideal of holy war is very different from the Crusade: it is essentially defensive whereas the Crusaders, like the Jewish holy warriors, had made a holy initiative when they attacked the enemies of God and his chosen people.&quot; Yet earlier in the same book she had written &quot;It was the duty of the Muslim state (the house of Islam) to conquer the rest of the non-Muslim world (the House of War) so that the world could reflect the divine unity.&quot;  How is this morally preferable to crusading theory?  <br /> Those who were crushed by Islamic expansionists in the seventh and eighth centuries seem to have been forgotten.

Davies begins with admirably concise chapters on the history of SETI,  &quot;Extraterrestrial Microbes,&quot; and the implications of detecting alien intelligences.  He then addresses biological and evolutionary arguments opposing the search, coming down firmly on the side of life and intelligence being emergent properties of the universe.  His long excursion into the nature of consciousness, illustrated by some rather crude diagrams, wanders away from this main line of argument until its end, when Davies returns to the idea that consciousness is an emergent property.<br /> Davies, who goes far deeper into the religious aspects of the search than most authors, has strongly held views that challenge the clear separation between the scientific and religious aspects of this topic.  He connects the search with spirituality.  The theme of alien beings acting as a conduit to the Ultimate, he writes, touches a deep chord in the human psyche.<br />If you are looking for a general introduction to the search and its implications, you will find more comprehensive treatments elsewhere.  This book does not pretend to be detached; it presents a well argued point of view.  Even if you don't agree with Davies, he deserves a reading.	2004-02-22

Moorehead describes the effects of initial European contacts with Tahiti, Australia, and the Antarctic, giving special attention to the voyages of Captain Cook.  Early British contacts with the Tahitians are described in fascinating detail.  Cook perceived that Western impact on Tahiti would have serious negative effects, writing that it would have been better for the Tahitians if the British had never visited the island.  In his description of the initial British colonization of Australia, Moorehead focuses on the mistreatment of the aborigines, including the complete elimination of native Tasmanians from their homeland.  Most of the section on the Antarctic is about Cook's determined attempts to reach the continent with his ships.  Cook's descriptions of abundant sea life around Antarctica had the unintended effect of provoking whalers and sealers to decimate many species.  Well written, this book is a chastening read.	2004-02-13

The two authors describe &quot;the conventional wisdom&quot; as defined by Carl Sagan, Frank Drake and others.  Then Rood and Trefil  examine the key factors one by one, ending each chapter with a section called &quot;Consequences for SETI&quot; or &quot;Implications for SETI.&quot;  Basically, they come up with much lower numbers than the optimists; the Earth is special after all.  Rood and Trefil do quick surveys of space colonization and the prospects for interstellar travel, dismissing the idea that UFOs carry alien visitors.  Each author wrote a separate conclusion to the book, giving his personal views.  Though now slightly dated, Are We Alone makes points that still must be addressed by SETI advocates.	2004-02-13

DeVorkin compares these competitive efforts to the early years of the Space Race.  Unfortunately, he focuses so much on the details of bureaucratic and scientific in-fighting that the adventurous aspects of the story get lost.  This would have been a more interesting book if the author had told us more about  the actual flights, particularly dramatic moments such as the bailout from the record breaking flight that was interrupted by a shredding balloon. DeVorkin mentions but does not describe the ultimate balloon trip, when an Air Force officer stepped out of a capsule 25 miles up and parachuted to safety.  Numerous black and white photos are reproduced in the book, most of them of scientists and other personalities involved in this competition. Authoritative, but dull.	2004-02-13

The balance tends to lean toward Regis' own skepticism.  As always in collections, the quality of the articles varies considerably; those that stick closest to the scientific questions tend to be more cleanly argued, while those addressing cultural, moral, and ethical issues are more discursive.  Lewis White Beck's 1971 speech, the first item in the book, is remarkable for its foresight and breadth.  Reading that piece and others may not leave you convinced one way or the other, but you will be better informed.	2004-02-13

The characters start having memory lapses, blanks in their recollections of conversations and other events, including deaths that may be murders.  The premise could have been developed as a science fiction idea with vast implications.  Unfortunately, the novel evolves into an increasingly conventional detective story, and the memory loss issue fades until it seems like an afterthought.  This may be a case in which mixing two genres in one book did not work.	2004-01-31

Beyond may be the best of them all.  Benson has done more than select the most interesting images from the past forty years of solar system exploration, many of them already familiar to space buffs.  He has processed those images to produce jaw-dropping pictures, some rising to the level of art.  In a few cases, he has combined images to form panoramas spread out over four unfolding pages.  <br />The book begins with the Earth and its Moon, then moves to the Sun and the other planets from Mercury out to Neptune.  Some of the most impressive images show moons transiting across the faces of Mars and Jupiter.  The book includes a foreword by Arthur C.  Clarke. Highly recommended.	2004-01-14

Most were illustrations accompanying published works of fiction.  These images, collected by Ordway, are very well reproduced and have useful captions.<br /> Until the second half of the nineteenth century, these depictions of space vehicles, other worlds, and their possible inhabitants were wildly fanciful.  After Jules Verne, improved astronomical observations and better engineering made these visions increasingly recognizable for those who grew up with the Space Age.  The book, which includes photographs of early rocket experiments, ends with an extensive section on the 1950's, covering the ideas of Wernher von Braun and illustrated with  paintings by Chesley Bonestell and Fred Freeman.<br />Readers may wonder why there are no visions from non-western cultures; were none sufficiently interesting, or do they really not exist? The foreword by Arthur C.  Clarke is disappointingly flippant.	2004-01-11

The text, while clearly written, is somewhat patchy in its coverage.  For example, the authors devote significant attention to New World civilizations including those of coastal Peru and the Mississippi valley, but leave out comparable societies in sub-Saharan Africa.  Interspersed among the historical accounts are special sections that briefly discuss stone tools, pottery, water and intensive agriculture, copper and bronze working, the beginning of writing, settlements, tombs and burial practices, warfare, iron technology, alphabets and developed writing, coinage and media of exchange, slavery, recreation, mathematics and measurement, ships and navigation, civil engineering, temples, astronomy and calendars, textiles, and medicine.  The numerous  illustrations, generally well presented, include many striking images that will be new to most readers.  The simple maps often lack sufficient detail.	2004-01-11

Named Pendergast, this man has nearly superhuman physical and mental powers and is apparently independent of the Bureau's authority.  So blond that he looks albino, he dresses in black suits that are never soiled or rumpled, even when he has been lying on his back in a cornfield in stifling summer heat.  In this case, Pendergast travels to western Kansas to track down a bizarre murderer who lives in a vast system of underground caverns.  Kansas is stereotyped as a bleak landscape of decaying towns separated by vast fields of corn.  State and local police officers are stereotyped as well; all but one come across as dim-witted, incompetent, or cowardly.  Not so Agent Pendergast, who never loses his icy self-control and who apparently never sweats even after the most strenuous exertions.  Like other novels in this series, this one includes some gruesome scenes.  One of the sub-themes, the growing of genetically modified corn, gets lost along the way.	2003-12-28

The scarcity of hard evidence from prehistoric times, particularly about physical changes in the brain, makes this difficult to do.  Mithen adopts the concept that there are different kinds of intelligence such as general, social, and technical.  In his view, human ancestors evolved from having only general intelligence to supplementing that with other, specialized intelligences that enabled tool-making and language.   The explosion in cultural creativity between 60,000 and 30,000 years ago occurred when these various intelligences were integrated, making possible art, religion, and science.  Consciousness adopted the role of an integrating mechanism for knowledge that had been trapped in separate specialized intelligences. <br /> Mithen writes that the use of  metaphor and analogy is the most significant feature of the human mind.  He has to rely on metaphor and analogy to convey some of the ideas in this book.  While his speculations are generally persuasive, they often rest on a frustratingly vague substrate. Mithen's epilogue on the origin of agriculture, being better founded on evidence, is more specific. The book is illustrated with numerous diagrams, some of them too schematic to be scientifically useful.	2003-12-17

Far from being a procedural, this story spends more time on church and Cold War politics than it does on investigation.  In this case, a Russian monk teaching at the  University of Chicago is found murdered in an apparently locked room.  The reasons for the monk's stay in Russia are more interesting than the crime.  It turns out that the body on the floor isn't the monk in question.  Though the Bishop's dwelling place is shot up by Russians, he never loses his aplomb.  Greeley tries to leaven the story with humorous repartee, but the Irish jokes wear off by the middle of the book.  The locked room question gets lost in the narrative, being resolved in an off-hand remark.  The ending is anticlimactic.  Yet the book has a certain quirky charm.	2003-12-11

The idea that California was an island persisted for two centuries despite reports from explorers that the Baja California peninsula was connected to the American mainland.  That myth was linked to others, including those of golden cities and of an island ruled by women.  The book is most interesting when Polk describes the linkages between the California myth, the mythical Strait of Anian, and the Northwest Passage so eagerly sought by the English and other northern Europeans.  In that case, the myth was intertwined with geopolitical maneuvering, including disinformation.  The book is generously illustrated with old maps.  The only negative is that the long quotes from documents sometimes slow down the forward motion of the narrative, though they may be necessary for academic thoroughness.	2003-11-29

One expert scientist could create a fatal disease that would sweep the world, if he were sufficiently motivated.  In this case, the scientist sees his wife and children killed by a car bomb in Ireland.  He devises an awesome means of revenge, initially focused on the countries he holds responsible.  The new plague gets out of control.<br /> This should have been sufficient material for a focused novel.  For reasons that seem murky, Herbert chose to limit his treatment of the basic issue to his first few chapters.  Most of the book is taken up with the scientist's long journey on foot across Ireland in the company of an IRA terrorist, a Catholic priest, and a mysterious boy.  Much of the dialogue is about Irish anger over the way they have been treated by the British.  All this is moderately interesting, but largely irrelevant to the basic story.  The scientist, by now shamed by the consequences of his actions, helps to devise a cure before going mad.  Herbert offers some speculations about the social impact of the plague toward the end of the book, but they seem far too late.	2003-11-23

Thirty years later, he updated and broadened the story.  Even though the second version is now nine years old, it still is the best general introduction for anyone new to SETI.<br /> Sullivan sets the stage with chapters describing how earlier conceptions of the universe were revised, giving us basic information about modern scientific views of stars and planetary systems.  He touches on the origin of life, how organic materials might be spread through space,  and the search for life on Mars.  He describes the Drake formula for determining the probability of extraterrestrial life, and the modern radio astronomy search for extraterrestrial signals.  Sullivan addresses the possibility of interstellar flight and discusses the Fermi Paradox.  He briefly describes the UFO phenomenon, concluding that there is no convincing evidence that we have been visited.  Sullivan's final chapter presents some of the speculations about the consequences of contact with ETI. The writing is clear and non-technical. The book includes a few diagrams and some black and white photographs.	2003-11-19

What is new is the power that science has given small numbers of people - possibly as few as one -  to endanger the entire species.   Our destiny depends increasingly on choices that we make ourselves.  These  are important themes that should have been developed in more detail.  Unfortunately, some of this relatively short book is taken up with futurist padding separated from the main point.<br /> Rees begins with familiar threats from nuclear and biological weapons, noting Fred Ikle's view that only an oppressive police state could assure total government control over novel tools of mass destruction.  Rees then turns to the implications of genetic engineering, including the creation of new forms of life that could feed off other materials in our environment.  Thanks to genetic engineering, the nature of humans could begin to change within this century; human character and physique will soon be malleable.  The potential threats may remind some readers of Frank Herbert's novel The White Plague, in which a lone scientist creates a spectacular method of revenge.<br /> Rees is most effective when he describes the potential implications of scientific experiments, particularly in particle physics.  He notes that some experiments are designed to generate conditions more extreme than ever occur naturally.  Here readers will learn about the possible human creation of black holes and strangelets.  Errors and unpredictable outcomes are a growing cause for worry; calculations of risk are based on probability rather than certainty.  Rees tells us that one person's act of irrationality, or even one person's error, could do us all in.  That should motivate a circumspect attitude toward technical innovations that pose even a small threat of catastrophic failure, though putting effective brakes on a field of research would require international consensus.  Rees speculates that the abandonment of privacy may be the minimal price for maintaining security. <br /> Rees is particularly critical of American attitudes toward science and technology.   Commenting that there are some who have a tenuous hold on rationality, he states that &quot;their  numbers may grow in the US.&quot;  Later in the book, he writes that in the US &quot;bizarre beliefs seem almost part of the mainstream.&quot;  The United States is hardly the only source of irrational people.<br /> Rees then turns to more conventional futurism, discussing the search for extraterrestrial life and human expansion into the solar system.  He implicitly advocates that humans should establish colonies beyond the Earth to assure that the species will survive a disaster on its home planet.<BR> <BR> There are some errors.  Rees writes that the Challenger explosion took place in 1987; it actually was a year earlier.  He describes Gerard O'Neill as an engineering professor; O'Neill actually was a professor of physics.  Rees links the SETI at Home computer network with the SETI Institute; in fact, that program is associated with Serendip IV, a project invented by professors at the University of California at Berkeley.	2003-11-12

Two nurses who journey to a remote mansion to care for a man suffering from a gunshot wound discover a poisonous atmosphere among their hosts and other guests.   After the host is killed, suspicion falls on one of the nurses.  Clues, some of them false leads, are dropped into the story at intervals. Unsuspected relationships become known. Our narrator, nurse Keate, discovers connections to the German-American Bund.  The early phases of World War Two are off screen but contribute to the atmosphere of suspicion. Innuendo plays as big a role as action.  The resolution of the mystery is reasonably satisfactory, with a climax that is notably less violent than modern Americans have come to expect.<br /> This book is one of a series in which Nurse Keate gets involved in mysteries. The writing is competent, though not brilliant.  The biggest problem is the large number of characters; readers may need a list of dramatis personae to keep track.	2003-11-07

The first part is a summary history describing sightings as far back as Biblical times. After a brief section on the treatment of alien visitors in films, the authors describe the &quot;saucer era&quot; that began in 1947.  Succeeding chapters intersperse selected sighting reports with more general historical  sections, including brief treatments of close encounters, abductions, Project Blue Book, and Men in Black.  Two sections show alleged photographs of UFOs, plus Air Force comments on them.  The book ends with speculations about ways in which advanced extraterrestrials might get around the galaxy.  <br />      The authors do not offer any firm conclusions themselves, though they clearly consider the issue of whether some UFO sightings are real to still be open.  Some of the art work seems rather unsophisticated by today's standards, particularly the crude treatment of lunar craters.	2003-11-06

His work,  part of Springer's Physics and Astronomy series, has the flavor of a university textbook, with numerous graphs, tables, and diagrams, and a few equations.  Readers will need either a basic knowledge of science or a willingness to learn while reading. <br /> Part I, about planets, discusses the origin of chemical elements, planet formation, the search for extrasolar planets, and planets suitable for life.   Part II, about life, begins at the most basic level of organic chemistry, then moves on to a condensed discussion of biological evolution on Earth.  A much briefer chapter provides a quick overview of the  search for extraterrestrial life.  Part III, on intelligence, takes an unusual approach by beginning with the future of Humankind, emphasizing human expansion into the solar system and possible threats to our survival.  Ulmschneider argues that, by thinking about our own future development, we can gain insights into the nature of extraterrestrial intelligence.  He concludes his book with a discussion of extraterrestrial intelligent life, briefly noting some of the proposed explanations for the Fermi Paradox.  <br />     This book is not for casual readers. Because it covers so much territory, the discussions are highly condensed. Nonetheless, Ulmschneider has done an impressvie job. The book includes some small but well-reproduced colored pictures.	2003-11-04

Books	4	2	2	N	Y	A different theory for finding extraterrestrials	The early part of this book covers ground that will be familiar to those who have read about the scientific search for extraterrestrial intelligence: the Drake equation for determining the number of alien civilizations, the search for radio signals(SETI), the absence of evidence (the Fermi Paradox), the evolution of life on planets.  The Clarks, a father and son team of scientists, then turn to their own thesis: searching for alien spacecraft is as legitimate a research endeavor as searching for alien radio signals.  They make the case for a scientific &quot;ufology.&quot;  This leads them into a discussion of the motivations for, and the feasibility of, interstellar flight.  They invent the term IMETI, which stands for ETI capable of interstellar mobility.  The Clarks discuss how to search for IMETI, including a winnowing out of UFO reports that would separate a genuine &quot;signal&quot; from the &quot;noise.&quot;  They favor the establishment of groups of researchers to pursue this quest.  Pointing out that SETI scientists overcame the giggle factor to persevere in their research, the Clarks argue that scientific ufologists can achieve the same level of credibility.  While many readers may instinctively reject the Clarks' thesis, it deserves as much of a hearing as most theories about extraterrestrials. <br /> This clearly written book, aimed at a non-scientific audience, is easy to read.  Unlike most books on this subject, it is not illustrated with photos or diagrams.	2003-11-03

The best film composers, like the ones discussed in this book, have produced some of the most stirring and enjoyable music of recent times.  After an interesting introductory chapter on the transition from silents to sound,  Darby and Du Bois discuss fourteen composers in detail, including the main themes they wrote for particular movies.  All the scores each composer worked on are listed at the end of the chapter.  Other chapters review film music developments by period, briefly discussing other composers.  An appendix lists the scores nominated for Academy Awards from the first in 1934 to 1988.  Readers with a serious interest in film music will find this book a valuable resource, though it needs to be updated to include the 1990's.  Readers with only a casual interest may find that the detailed discussions of themes tell them more than they want to know.	2003-10-29

Austin uncovers a plot to wipe out the  ocean's fish species, replacing them with vicious, genetically engineered salmon (the economic theory behind this is never made very clear).  The corporation behind the plot kills off people who get in its way, using stereotyped bloodthirsty Mongoloid men as shock troops.  The plot involves a dirigible reconstructed from the wreckage of one that crashed in the Arctic during the 1920's (would you fly in this thing?)  This zeppelin is housed in a huge structure in the Canadian wilds that makes itself invisible by adapting its exterior to its surroundings.  When Austin and his sidekick are caught on board the airship, does the chief villain kill them on the spot?  No, of course not.  He keeps them alive to see how the plan will be carried out, and to escape.  This wasn't very believable when Goldfinger decided not to cut James Bond in half with a laser.  While the writing is generally competent, the story stretches credibility a bit too far.  Austin's romantic relationship with the only significant female character is a perfunctory throwaway.  Is it any surprise that she has to be rescued by our hero?	2003-10-24

He has remained active in the scientific search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) ever since.  Drake founded  the non-profit SETI Institute, whose Project Phoenix is the most powerful of the current radio astronomy searches. <br /> This accessible book, co-written with journalist Dava Sobel, is partly an autobiography and partly a non-technical survey of SETI.

He describes the book as an assemblage of data of external relations of this earth, &quot;damned&quot; by those who hold for our planet's isolation.  According to Fort, the attitude of Science and Christian Science toward the unwelcome is the same: it does not exist.<br />Some of the events described in these reports would be described today as UFO's.  While some of these cases may warrant attention, others seem marginal.<br /><br />Fort hypothesizes that &quot;there is somewhere aloft a place&quot; where life may have orginated; &quot;evolution on this earth has been induced by external influences.&quot;  He offers alternative explanations for unexplained sightings: another world that is in secret communication with certain &quot;esoteric&quot; inhabitants of this earth; other worlds that are trying to establish communication with all the inhabitants of the earth; other worlds and vast structures that pass us by without the slightest desire to communicate; a vast construction that has often come to this earth, dipped into an ocean, then gone away.  At one point, Fort writes that the earth was a no-man's land explored and colonized by other worlds; now something owns this earth, warning off all others.  All this, he goes on, has been known, perhaps for ages, to certain ones upon the earth.<br />It is hard to know how much of this is serious and how much is just satire. Fort's imagined super-constructions a few miles above the earth stretch credibility too far. His quirky writing style, though sometimes entertaining, tends to further undermine his believability.

He examines the assumptions and logic of those engaged in SETI, particularly astronomers.  Lamb points out that arguments based on probability and analogy can not be conclusive, though they provide legitimate bases for scientific speculation.  He acknowledges that SETI differs from most sciences in the sense that it is driven by metaphysical beliefs and deep psychological desires for companionship.  But, he adds, world-views do not have to be antithetical to scientific evidence.<br /> Lamb comes down in favor of continuing the search.  &quot;SETI might well turn out to be an example of too much speculation chasing too few facts,&quot; he writes, &quot;but this is not an argument for dismissing its conjectures as nonsense; rather, it indicates a requirement to go ahead and produce more facts.&quot;  He believes that most of our predictions about contact with an advanced civilization are likely to be wrong.  Lamb includes balanced presentations on the Fermi Paradox and the UFO phenomenon.<br /> The book contains some errors about scientific facts.  In discussing the Drake equation and related issues, Lamb provides wildly varying figures for the number of stars in our galaxy.  He writes that, if a Gamma Ray Burster went off near the center of our galaxy, &quot;within seconds the Earth would be exposed to a massive wave of gamma rays.&quot;  These errors do not undermine his basic arguments; the virtues of the book far outweigh its minor faults.	2003-10-17

After using hypnosis and other techniques to draw out victims' memories, he concluded that they were not inventing their stories; they had suffered traumatic experiences, in many cases more than once.  Mack also found that their stories were remarkably consistent.  The cases he studied may be only the tip of an iceberg; a 1991 survey showed that at least several hundred thousand Americans have had abduction experiences.<br /> Mack argues that abductions force us to reconsider our perception of reality; &quot;no familiar theory or explanation has come even close to accounting for the basic features of the abduction phenomenon.&quot;  As abductions can not be understood within the framework of Western science, a new scientific paradigm may be necessary.  Mack speculates that the aliens may be from other dimensions.  At the end, he offers his personal opinion that &quot;abductions have to do with the evolution of consciousness and the collapse of a worldview that has placed humankind at a kind of epicenter of intelligence in a cosmos perceived as largely lifeless and meaningless.&quot;  <br /> Mack writes that &quot;When we explore phenomena that exist at the margins of accepted reality, old words become imprecise or must be given new meanings.&quot;  His own words suffer from that problem; many readers will find his analyses vague and fuzzy-minded, particularly when he writes about spirituality.  Many of his speculations appear in both his introductory and concluding chapters, an annoying duplication.<br />     Readers may be struck by how closely the X-Files followed the abductees' descriptions of their experiences, including implants and the creation of alien-human hybrids.  The warnings delivered to some abductees sound a bit like those in the 1951 film The Day the Earth Stood Still, or in the more recent film The Abyss, suggesting that abductees mayhave been influenced by their own cultural experiences.  Nonetheless, something peculiar happened to these people.	2003-10-16

In this case, a &quot;genetic vaccine&quot; which is to be inserted into corn by a virus gets out of control; the virus jumps the species barrier.  People and animals who eat contaminated corn get sick, and some die from ebola.  The amateurs who investigate this situation discover that the main villain is using terrorist tactics to force the American public to address the issue of genetic engineering, particularly the transfer of genetic material from one species to another.  The evil one exploits unsuspecting environmentalists to support his plot and causes more than four hundred deaths.  <br />Calling attention to this problem is a worthy goal.  However, the paragraphs of technical explanations will go over the heads of most readers.  The two main investigators seem unbelievably reckless.  While the action scenes are written effectively, the love and sex scenes are unconvincing.	2003-10-12

Examples include Noah's Flood,  Eden in the East, Voyages of the Pyramid Builders, and 1421: The Year China Discovered America.<br /> Catastrophe is one of the best of these.  Archaeological writer David Keys has assembled multiple arguments supporting his theory that a major natural disaster around the year 535 altered the world's climate for years, causing famine and plague and triggering the collapse of existing political systems.  He gives us brief but well-written summaries of events that sprang from this catastrophe, including the rise of Islam.  According to Keys, this event ended an old world and gave birth to a new one whose patterns we still see today.  After a process of elimination, Keys proposes that the cause of this disaster was a volcano in what is now the Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra.  He warns that natural catastrophes in the future could change the world we know.  Even if you don't agree with his conclusion, you will learn much from his reviews of historical events.  This is fascinating stuff, and highly readable.	2003-10-10

For centuries, these people of the book managed to live and work together in an atmosphere of relative tolerance.  Menocal emphasizes the intellectual and artistic achievements of that era, particularly the translations of Greek and Roman texts from Arabic into Latin and other European languages.  Most of her writing is seductively accessible, notably in the earlier chapters.  An atmosphere of tragedy seeps in later as Muslim and Christian puritans with little Andalucian experience disrupt the culture of tolerance.  Menocal shows sympathy for sophisticated Arabs and scholarly Jews, but is less favorably inclined toward Christians, who are more likely to be portrayed as intolerant.  While not an authoritative history, the book is worth reading.	2003-10-09

Like many others who have made this claim, he relies on a mixture of documents, media reports, interviews, and hearsay to support his case.  He focuses heavily on Great Britain and the United States, with special attention to military and intelligence agencies.  <br />While Good does cover a lot of material, people who have read into this field will have seen many of these reports and allegations before.  Only those predisposed to accept Good's thesis will find the book persuasive.  He often uses unconvincing phrases such as &quot;I have been informed that,&quot; &quot;I feel certain that,&quot; and &quot;it must have become obvious that.&quot;   Some of his sources &quot;claim&quot; that certain facts are true.  Good dismisses denials by sources as credible as Neil Armstrong.  <br />Though Good says at the beginning of his book that a bona fide UFO does not necessarily imply an extraterrestrial spacecraft, he comes down firmly in favor of the alien visit hypothesis at the end because &quot;it is the only one that explains most of the facts.&quot;  Arguing that we are under surveillance, he writes that &quot;we are being visited by several different groups of extraterrestrials.&quot;  Good believes that aliens have made selective contacts with hundreds of individuals.  Accepting the idea that the aliens are similar to us physiologically, he theorizes that some of them have had a hand in our evolution.  None of these statements are clearly supported by evidence available to the rest of us.  The only useful feature of this book is the one hundred plus page appendix, which reproduces large numbers of documents with various degrees of relevance to the UFO issue.  <br /> We have had no objective, scholarly, book-length study of the UFO phenomenon since 1975, when historian David Michael Jacobs published The UFO Controversy in America.  Will some scholar please fill this gap?	2003-09-29

Mankell's protagonist, Swedish police officer Kurt Wallander, is not a super-hero who outwits and outfights legions of bad guys.  Nor is he as phenomenally lucky as the heros in many American thrillers.  Wallander, a dedicated cop, has a believable internal life.  His real-world personal problems include loneliness, distance from his adult daughter, and a threat to his position from an ambitious younger officer.  His horrendously long hours make him feel exhausted; he gets frustrated with baffling evidence and failed plans.  Yet he persists in trying to understand the connections between the deaths he is investigating.  Different pieces of the puzzle appear at well-paced intervals during the story.  There are surprises that don't fit theories.  The conspiracy that emerges turns out to reach far beyond local events.  Though the chief villain gets nailed at the end of the book, Mankell does not wrap things up in a neat package.  The threat is still out there.  <br /> Subsidiary themes of the book include the vulnerability of our technological society, and resentment of the growing concentration of wealth.  There are a few problems.  Many of the Swedish names sound alike, making it difficult to separate some policemen and policewomen from others.  Mankell's writing, translated from Swedish, sometimes produces short, choppy sentences.  There is a peculiar fixation on checking the time.  Nonetheless, this book rises far above most mysteries.	2003-09-29

That group was assembled and funded by the SETI Institute, the leading institution in the field.  The report focuses first on strategic objectives, then on search strategies and options for new telescope and computer designs.  <br /> This document was intended to be a landmark comparable to the visionary Project Cyclops report published in 1972.  Technological advances since then -- particularly in computer technology -- clearly justified a fresh review.   SETI 2020 recommends broadening the frequency range of searches to include optical and infrared wavelengths, looking for both continuous wave and pulsed signals, and using multiple beams per telescope in microwave searches.  The report recommends that the SETI Institute undertake the development and construction of a One Hectare Radio Telescope, and an omnidirectional SETI system that could allow continuous, all-sky coverage for the low end of the microwave window.  The Working Group also endorsed some existing strategies: using systems for both targeted searches and sky surveys, and focusing on beacons. <BR>   <BR> Nearly half of this book consists of technical appendices.  The most intriguing of them is Jill Tarter's review of the Project Cyclops report from the perspective of 25 years later.  Not only has  technological advance improved our capabilities and widened our options; we also know more about the science involved.<BR> <BR> Those readers with a serious interest in the technical means astronomers use to search for evidence of intelligence beyond the Earth will find this book very informative.   It will tell most readers all they want to know about the technology issues, though less about the science.  While the language is clear and straightforward, it lacks the stirring, visionary quality of the Cyclops report.  Perhaps that is a sign that SETI has matured.  Or it could be the result of drafting by committee.   Those readers who are looking for an introduction to SETI or a general overview of that field should look elsewhere, particularly in view of the outrageous price.	2003-09-28

It's actually somewhat better than that.   In their short chapters, Hough and Randles use a mixture of interviews and brief histories to provide some insights into how different people see possible contact with extraterrestrials.  They include a wide variety of perspectives, from sober astronomers to Agent Mulder types.  They  offer a sampling rather than comprehensive coverage. While these British authors are enthusiastic about their subject, they check out the believability of some reports about contact and describe some hoaxes.

Drawing on original sources in several languages,  Guthke deftly analyes the major works about life and intelligence beyond the earth, both in fiction and in scientific speculation.  He captures the spirit of each age as its intellectuals confronted the question of whether or not we are alone.  He describes the encounter with the alien, as either an enemy or a guardian, as the philosophical and imaginative adventure of modern times; we are exploring the last frontier we can think of.  Originally published in German in 1983, the book has been ably translated into English.	2003-09-24

Science historian Stephen Dick describes a new paradigm of the universe that integrates biology.  Where once we seemed lost in a vast and empty Cosmos, now we can credibly argue that we may be part of a living universe.<br /> Dick sets the stage by surveying the debates over the existence of life and intelligence beyond the Earth up to the beginning of the 20th century, seeing the extraterrestrial life debate as a struggle for a world view that has advanced in stages.   He connects the plurality of worlds with the decline of anthropocentrism, describing the latter as one of the major intellectual changes of the past century.   He then describes how Percival Lowell's theories about Mars demonstrated the limits of astronomical observation.  He goes into scientific theories about the origins of planets before discussing images of extraterrestrials in literature and the arts.  Dick takes on the UFO controversy in an admirably objective way.   He reviews scientific theories about the origin and evolution of life before describing the modern search for radio signals known as SETI.  Dick argues convincingly that we have seen the birth of a new science: astrobiology.  He concludes by discussing some of the implications of possible future contact with an extraterrestrial civilization. In his summary, he describes the triumph of an evolutionary view of the Cosmos, and the emergence of the biological universe as a worldview.  This is a basic work for any serious student of the extraterrestrial life issue.	2003-09-24

Drawing on a theory developed by Stephen Oppenheimer in his book Eden in the East, Schoch argues that this mother culture was based in Sundaland, a vast extension of Southeast Asia that now lies under the sea.  Ancient seafarers, fleeing this flooded subcontinent, allegedly diffused their culture to other parts of the world.   According to Schoch, the pyramids were symbolic connections to the heavens inspired by comet-related disasters, &quot;a response to dangerous skies.&quot;  Schoch ranges widely over ancient cultures, citing similarities in support of his case.  He devotes an appendix to redating the Great Sphinx at Giza, arguing that it is much older than the nearby pyramids.  While all this is entertaining, the evidence is circumstantial; there are not enough hard facts to make Schoch's theory convincing.  The book includes colored photographs of pyramids, those of the Egyptian versions being particularly well done.	2003-09-20

Cookman sets the race in its time, describing how different American life was then. Social classes were more separated from each other, and lives were shorter.  Cookman depicts the main players, nearly all of them rich and powerful men who looked down on ordinary mortals. The most interesting commoner is professional yacht racer Charley Barr, who captained the great three-masted schooner Atlantic to victory despite the yacht's self-centered owner.  Racing across an ocean was more dangerous then; no radio, no global positioning system, no weather faxes, no emergency beacons.  The outcome was unpredictable until the lead yacht appeared off the Lizard.  If you like sailing and adventure, this one is worth reading.	2003-09-14

While the real events were less romantic in the narrow sense, they were even more exciting as adventures.  These men -- and one woman who played only a brief part -- were daring and determined, often driving hundreds of miles across unmapped desert landscapes or flying rickety aircraft to remote sites deep in the Sahara. Some of their feats, such as rescuing refugees from Libya, deserve the word heroic. Most of the men observed a code of conduct that now seems like a leftover from the age of chivalry.  Their companionships were strained by the outbreak of the war in North Africa, when both sides drew on their expertise. In that context, Kelly introduces us to the little-known exploits of the British Long Range Desert Group. Here and in some other parts of the book, he is too thorough  in describing the details of missions.  Some careful pruning by an editor would have made this interesting book even better.	2003-09-14

Arguing that knowing the sky has always been important, he cites examples of how several ancient societies perceived the heavens, particularly in Mesoamerica and the Near East.  Aveni, an expert on ancient astronomy, warns against believing that any ways other than our own of understanding and explaining nature have no value. In effect, he questions the primacy of the modern scientific method. Aveni seems to agree with those who suggest that there may be many answers, each valid in an appropriately understood framework, to the question of how nature works.  Many readers may find this perspective too relativist or New Age.  Dare one say politically correct?  The book includes black and white illustrations.	2003-09-10

After touching on interstellar flight, he closes with a discussion of the claim that Earth has been visited by aliens.  All this adds up to a broad brush overview, leaving out most of the detailed arguments associated with this question.

Describing how many traditional societies have abused their environments, he connects pre-modern warfare directly to population growth and resource scarcity.  Warfare in the past, he writes, may have ultimately been driven by rational response to diminishing resources.   <br /> Bringing his thesis forward into modern times, LeBlanc again challenges conventional wisdom.  His optimistic conclusion: warfare has declined over time, suggesting that it is not an inherently human behavior.  The proportion of the population involved in war has been declining; there has been a reduction in war deaths on a per capita basis.  The Industrial Revolution, LeBlanc writes, increased the world's carrying capacity; technology and science enable us to understand the Earth's ecology and our impact on it, to control population growth, and to increase the carrying capacity in ways never before imagined.  According to LeBlanc, we are on the right trajectory for world peace.<br /> Sweeping conclusions like these must rattle the liberal intellectual establishment that has kept us on a collective guilt trip for decades.  Those conclusions would be more convincing if LeBlanc had provided us with systematic data instead of relying on anecdotes.  Such a book might have been drier to read, but more powerful.	2003-09-04

He covers Attila and the Huns, the Arabs during their period of expansion, the Turks, Genghis Khan and the Mongols, and, strangely, the Vikings.   Kennedy tells us that all adult male nomads were potential warriors; there were no civilians in these societies.   He gives particular attention to the Mongols, devoting two chapters to them but only one each to the other groups.  The chapter on the Vikings seems somewhat out of place, as they were not nomadic.   <br />Most readers will gain new insights from these surveys.

He began with the events of 1896 and 1897, providing a useful perspective on UFO sightings as a recurrent phenomenon.  Jacobs gave particularly close attention to U.S. Air Force investigations of UFO's up to 1969, describing the clash between those who wanted to dismiss the importance of this subject and those who wanted to make it a national priority.  He also described the now generally discredited contactees of the 1950's, citizens UFO groups such as NICAP, Congressional hearings, and the infamous Condon Committee Report.  Much of the debate involved skeptics and advocates attacking each other's credibility.  Jacobs concluded  that identification of credible sightings remained the heart of the issue.  Jacobs, who clearly surveyed a huge volume of material, was generally even-handed in his coverage.  The book included a forward by the late J.  Allen Hynek, but very few illustrations -  nine black and white photographs.  <br /> While this study remains a basic document, it now is dated.  An equally scholarly treatment of the history of this phenomenon since 1974 is long overdue. Hopefully, such a study will be more thoroughly illustrated.	2003-08-29

Winchester's vivid descriptions of the eruption, including eye-witness accounts, will hold the reader's attention.  His argument that the eruption was the first major event quickly reported around the world (by telegraph) is intriguing.  His descriptions of Dutch colonial life in Indonesia make interesting reading because this subject is so rarely covered in English.  However, Winchester almost certainly goes too far in theorizing that this disaster motivated Indonesia's anti-Dutch nationalism.  The introduction to plate tectonics may be more than most readers want to know.

He makes a good case that Spain (particularly Castile) could not have kept this enterprise going without help. Influential people from other European nations had an interest -- particularly an economic interest -- in maintaining the Empire. They supplied much of the money through loans and most of the military personnel as well. Kamen assembles extensive supporting evidence for his revisionist theory.  His description of the Empire as the first example of globalization is intriguing, though that globalization was of a different sort from what we see today. The more than five hundred pages of text may discourage non-academic readers.  The book includes some fine color plates.	2003-08-25

This book should have been an opportunity to summarize his findings in a clearly written, easily read way for people who are unlikely to read his more detailed studies.  Pyne does offer us many interesting observations and perspectives on the history of fire.  Unfortunately, he imposes a pretentious &quot;writerly&quot; style on his material, making his book laborious to read.  His self-conscious literary artistry obscures as much as it reveals.  Many of his poetic statements are not explained with supporting facts.  A more straightforward telling of this story would be welcome.	2003-08-25

Larson's hero is architect Daniel Burnham, who overcame huge obstacles to bring this project to fruition.  Larson is persuasive in describing the achievements of Burnham and his allies, but less convincing when he argues that this extremely ambitious fair marked a turning point in American history.  In parallel, Larson describes the actions of mass murderer H.H. Holmes, who was killing women in Chicago at that time.  This seems an odd conjunction, as if the author were trying to leaven the Fair's history with a frisson of horror.  A more serious criticism is that Larson invents the thoughts, feelings, and oral statements of many characters, apparently based on his own speculations.  The book would have been interesting enough without going beyond the facts.	2003-08-25

She describes many points of physical and cultural similarity between the Zuni and the Japanese, though she does not provide direct evidence for a voyage across the Pacific.

WHERE IS EVERYBODY?: Fifty Solutions to the Fermi Paradox and the Problem of Extraterrestrial Life	Books	4	5	8	N	Y	A lively, stimulating book, but not definitive	In this engagingly readable book, physicist Stephen Webb offers fifty solutions to the Fermi Paradox concerning the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence.  He focuses on communicating civilizations, the ones that would be easiest to detect.  Webb divides the solutions into three broad categories: They Are Here, They Exist but Have Not Yet Communicated, and They Do Not Exist.  Most of the proposed solutions are meant to be taken seriously, but others seem whimsical.  Some of the most interesting material is in the notes at the back of the book.<br />       In the end, Webb sides with the third theme: They Do Not Exist.  Such a conclusion is almost certainly premature.  Given the very limited searches conducted so far, we easily could have missed evidence of a technological civilization.  Our assumptions about what to look for may be wrong.  Radio may characterize a phase of technology that more advanced cultures leave behind.  Even those intelligences that never broadcast interstellar radio signals and never send interstellar probes to check out other planetary systems could be of great interest.  The search is far from over.<br /> While Webb's fifty reasons are indicative, they are by no means comprehensive.  Nor is his conclusion definitive.  There still is plenty of room for disciplined speculation about this fascinating question.	2003-07-25

There is no tension in the first half of the book; no suspense, no real mystery. The action is concentrated at the end.  The author employs a tactic used too often in female-centered mysteries; the murderer behaves like a gentleman the first time the protagonist gets too nosy, bopping her on the head but then delivering her unconscious body to her home.  That behavior truly requires suspension of disbelief.  Male readers in particular are likely to find the story terminally boring.	2003-07-24

The desire to convey some essence of ourselves, Benford writes, is the great impulse behind deep time messages.  But there also is a desire to shape the future, and to use the idea of the future to shape the present.  He describes his personal experience as a member of a group advising the Department of Energy on what kind of markers should be used to warn future humans of an underground radioactive waste depository.  He then turns to the design of plaques to be attached to spacecraft that will leave the solar system, unfortunately getting bogged down in bureaucratic and interpersonal battles involving NASA officials.  Other subjects addressed are preserving a record of biodiversity in a &quot;Library of Life&quot; and addressing human-caused climate change, leading toward &quot;planetary management.&quot;  These are all good themes, but Benford's conclusion does not propose an overall approach or a more systematic way of addressing our long-term future.	2003-07-21

In fact, direct discussion of that event occupies less than twenty per cent of the text.  Much of the rest is a history of scientific ideas about the history of life and the great extinctions, with considerable attention to the individuals who advocated them.  While the book is written in a readable style, the reader may be frustrated by the author's cautiousness in drawing conclusions about the Big One.  The book ends with a discussion of what Benton calls the Sixth Extinction, caused by human activity, implying that it is comparable to the one at the end of the Permian.

Books	4	7	7	N	Y	Wonderful Survey, Dubious Conclusion	This book may provide the most balanced and readable non-technical overview in print of how life and intelligence developed on the Earth.  Burger covers an amazingly wide variety of scientific issues, ranging from the probability of planetary systems around other stars to the evolution of our basic technologies.  Unfortunately, Burger's balanced presentation falls apart in the last chapter when he turns to his primary purpose, which is to discredit the idea that intelligent life and technological civilizations may exist elsewhere.  Suddenly we find ourselves reading opinions based on unproven assumptions, personal beliefs, and politically correct ideology.  Burger introduces values into the Drake equation that are as arbitrary as those used by scientists who are optimistic about the existence of other civilizations.  He tells us that finding another planet as good as ours is &quot;close to impossible,&quot; a truly odd statement given the recent  successes in finding other planetary systems.  Interstellar travel is described as a &quot;near-impossibility,&quot; though no law of physics or engineering makes it so. <br />Burger argues that, since our own evolutionary path is extremely unlikely to be  repeated because of unique circumstances and chance developments, intelligence is unlikely to evolve elsewhere.  He fails to consider the possibility that there may be many other possible evolutionary paths in other environments, also driven by both chance and necessity, that could lead to intelligences very different from our own.  Physical and cultural evolutions elsewhere do not have to duplicate ours to produce intelligence and civilization.  <br />Burger shows his cultural pessimism when he writes that &quot;the present drama unfolding on planet Earth makes it seem highly likely that energy-guzzling technological societies have a short life span,&quot; clearly an  unproven assumption.  He repeats this conclusion on the last page when he writes that &quot;it seems highly likely that creatures with higher cognitive intelligence...come into being from time to time, then quickly fade away.&quot;  How can he possibly draw such a conclusion  from one example?  This is opinion, not science.<br />Since Copernicus, scientists have discredited the assumption of human centrality again and again.  Yet many biologists still seem to cling to anthropocentrism.  The history of science suggests that, in the long run, they are riding for a fall.	2003-07-18

He tracks historical records and visits previously unexplained archaeological sites, many of which are pictured in the illustrations.  According to Mowat, the Albans migrated first to Iceland, then Greenland, and finally to Labrador and Newfoundland.

Even with its flaws, most of this story is engrossing. <br />The narrator, a paleontologist with particular expertise in dinosaurs, is so deeply affected by the deaths of women he cares about that he volunteers for one-way time travel to the age of the dinosaurs.  This first section could have been cut to a third of its length by focusing on only one of the deaths; the use of multiple tragedies slows down the narrative, delaying the reader's entry into the well-imagined adventure of living among dinosaurs.  <br />The author clearly has done considerable research on that period.  His descriptions of places and actions are vivid and compelling, though the narrator seems reckless about his own safety.

Menzies even argues that Chinese colonies were planted in the Americas, disappearing from view as they mingled with indigenous populations.<BR> <BR>In his personal quest, Menzies has accumulated a vast amount of circumstantial evidence in support of his theory, attaching to it the interpretations most supportive of his argument.  Some of this evidence is persuasive, but much of it is only suggestive.  Nonetheless, the sheer weight of evidence will cause most readers to conclude that there is some truth to Menzies' thesis, at least enough to warrant more professional research. That makes one wonder why Western historians  have ignored or dismissed the evidence for centuries.  And how much history is unknown to us because political decisions dictated the destruction of records, as was the case in Ming China.  At the very least, this book should provoke a re-evaluation of Chinese influence on the West before the age of European expansion. <br />Menzies continues to pursue his theory, inviting others to provide supporting evidence through his web site.

Lewis and Clark have been covered thoroughly, even triumphally, because they completed their task.  Freeman and Curtis have been ignored because they were intercepted by Spanish soldiers after exploring hundreds of miles of the Red River.  Historian Dan Flores, drawing on both American and Spanish sources,  performs a real service by describing this southern expedition and placing it within the context of its time (1806).  Flores reminds us that the Spanish tried to stop Lewis and Clark too, but missed them.  He shows us that the scheming General Wilkinson wanted the Freeman and Custis expedition to provoke a war with Spain, and nearly succeeded.  Flores provides an introduction before the expedition's own account, and an epilogue after.  His annotation of the expedition's documents is exceptionally thorough and often fascinating.

There is no real mystery here; we know the identity of the murderer in the first chapter.  The only question is whether the police will find him before he kills again.  The conversations among police officers are moderately amusing, but the good guy's significant other is more a token presence than a relevant character.	2002-07-19

The major characters all are well-born, though not necessarily solvent.  A high-spirited woman who fought in the failed 1848 revolution in Vienna is found dead in an artist's flat in London, along with the body of a woman of much less repute.  Investigator William Monk and his wife Hester pursue the case, believing that the police have arrested the wrong man.  Much of the motivation is driven by reactions to improper behavior, such as (horrors!)  compulsive gambling.  Characters struggle against Victorian restraints on personal behavior.  London is dense with choking fog.  All this would be interesting if the author had dropped a clue or two that would allow the reader to deduce the identity of the murderer.  Unfortunately, we get an Agatha Christie ending.	2002-07-11

In one hundred and fifty pages, Boone gives us a very readable summary of Aztec history, culture, religion, economics, and politics.  While she describes the horrors of human sacrifice, she also lets us see the more positive sides of Aztec life,  including the glory of Tenochtitlan.

His protagonist, a woman who has had a nightmare past including criminal convictions, is an expert in using computers to track illegal bank accounts.  She also is an expert in creating new identities for herself.  While working with American law enforcement officials, she discovers the horrors of illegal trafficking in women, particularly from Eastern Europe.  Corruption is everywhere.  Characters betray each other; some are gunned down.  The shorthand language of computerese pops up in the middle of normal prose.

Unfortunately, this most recent Navajo police novel is less inventive than some of the earlier works in this series.  The two central characters are here: Joe Leaphorn, the once legendary Lieutenant who still gets involved in cases despite his retirement, and Jim Chee, the taciturn sergeant who wants to be a Navajo religious singer.  One senses that the aging Hillerman has become more interested in the older Leaphorn than in the younger Chee, who is somewhat underutilized in this story.  Chee's former love interest has faded out of the picture, to be replaced by the more sympathetic policewoman Bernadette Manuelito.  The fine descriptions of Navajo Country's  landscape are here too, though they are not quite as eloquent as in some earlier books.  What is missing is a clever mystery that challenges the reader to sleuth alongside Leaphorn and Chee, with unexpected twists and turns.  Many readers will figure out what happened to the missing woman long before the final chapter.  They may regret the lack of moral weight in the outcome.	2002-06-27

She addresses story ideas, using personal experiences, story development and plotting, first and second drafts, revisions, and other dimensions of the writing craft.  Highsmith is honest up front, stating that &quot;This is not a how-to-do-it handbook.&quot;  After giving writers the somewhat despairing advice that &quot;It is impossible to explain how a successful -- that is readable -- book is written,&quot; she goes on to describe her own methods, describing failures as well as successes.  There are some useful hints in here, but much of the material is too personalized to be of general use.   Suspense writers need a better handbook than this one.	2002-06-21

Inscriptions on the monoliths praise the achievements of a future leader named Kuin.  Is he sending these colossal objects back in time to influence the course of history?  How can present day people stop him?  The male narrator, a somewhat degenerate and irresponsible techie, is drawn into the effort to counter the chronoliths.  The female scientist leading this campaign comes across as brilliant but weird.  Beyond the scientific concept, the most interesting aspect of the story is the semi-religious pro-Kuin social movement that emerges.  These true believers oppose those who want to disrupt the arrival of the chronoliths, leading to a violent confrontation in the Dakotas.  Great concept, but it's difficult to care about these characters.	2002-06-21

Scenarios addressed range from the Russo-Japanese front to attacks on California and the Japanese conquest of India.  Each chapter ends with a section entitled The Reality for contrast.  The editor deserves congratulations for maintaining a high level of consistency among papers by different authors, generally avoiding overlap or duplication.  The only exception is the  last chapter (on the invasion of Japan's home islands), which is awkwardly and unconvincingly cast as as a lecture with questions and answers.  The book includes maps of varying quality and a section of photographs from the Pacific war.  Rising Sun Victorious, which includes detailed descriptions of military campaigns and battles, is for readers with a serious interest in military history.	2002-06-18

What if Adolf Hitler had been incapacitated when his aircraft crash-landed in 1941?  German generals might have pursued their preferred option on the Eastern Front, concentrating their advance on the capture of Moscow.  Downing goes on from there, describing alternate outcomes in other theaters.  What if Rommel had received the reinforcements he needed to defeat the British in the Egyptian desert?  What if the Japanese had won the battle of Midway?  These scenarios are well thought out and generally convincing.  Downing concludes that the Germans and the Japanese eventually would have been overcome by superior allied resources.  But the world might look different today because of early Axis power successes.  This book, originally published in 1979, includes a few diagrams of battles and a disappointing dot and line map of the Pacific.	2002-06-18

They discover a girl whose wings enable her to fly.  That's right, wings with feathers.  She turns out to be one of several flying youth who are the products of a secret genetic engineering program.  The people behind the program kill to protect their research and the profits they expect to make from it.  Their work also has produced mistakes, tragically deformed children who are left to die.  Patterson's breathlessly paced novel calls attention to a real issue, the use of genetic engineering techniques to create humans with new characteristics.  Unfortunately, the energetics of sustained rapid flight by a winged human stretch credibility past the breaking point.	2002-06-05

Fagan, an experienced writer of books on archeology and history, does a fine job of conveying the past impacts of climate shifts on societies.  He writes that &quot;climate change is the ignored player on the historical stage.&quot;  He extrapolates forward, warning us of the potential for major climatic changes in the future caused at least in part by human activity.  He is less successful in drawing linkages between the scientific findings of climatology and historical events, leaving those connections implied rather than stated.  More description of the science would have been helpful, as well as an acknowledgement that the degree of scientific certainty still is under debate.	2002-06-05

While the early chapters and the concluding chapter give us intelligent but conventional history writing, much of the book focuses on Wills' interpretations of Venetian Renaissance art and architecture.  His intriguing scholarly observations place these works in the context of Venetian history, politics, and society.  Wills also highlights many of Venice's most striking personalities.  The book is extensively illustrated with black and white reproductions; a central section presents 31 color plates.  Readers with a strong interest in the visual arts will find this book fascinating.  Other readers may find the second half heavy going.	2002-05-07

The flora and fauna of the imaginary world Prokaryon are intriguing, particularly when they begin to reveal a hidden intelligence.  The visitors to Prokaryon are diverse, including different sorts of humans and intelligent machines, all communicating effortlessly with each other.  Medical nanotechnology sends microscopic probes through bodies to remove unwanted organisms.  Less inventive is the ubiquitous nanoplast, a substance that shapes and reshapes according to need but is never explained.  Neutrinograms allow faster than light communication, another version of an old science fiction device.

The author has drawn on both Christian and Moslem source materials, sometimes quoting them at length.  He describes the politics as thoroughly as these sources allow.  Some of the material on the Mudejars living in Christian kingdoms is too detailed to sustain the interest of most readers.  On the other hand, the final chapters about the decline and fall of Muslim Granada have some of the fatal momentum of Greek tragedy.  The biggest disappointment is the maps, the line and dot variety that give no hint of the terrain the contesting forces had to cross.	2002-04-11

A decade ago, we were given stories about coldly ambitious, ruthless protagonists who overcame threats with actions that would challenge Arnold Schwarzenegger, and who treated women as throwaways.  Now yuppie heros, having arrived at the pinnacle of career success, realize that they have shamefully ignored the significant others in their lives -- but only after a crisis affects them personally.  In this case, an extremely successful Seattle lawyer finds that his neglected wife has disappeared.  An investigation of bizarre murders that may be the work of a serial killer overlaps his own search.  A female FBI agent who is part American Indian gets involved with the case.  The writing is crisp enough, and there are some surprises along the way, particularly concerning the missing wife.  However, the increasingly predictable cinematic confrontation near the end seems far too much like the Federal law enforcement assault on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas.	2002-04-10

The author, an experienced technical diver himself, combines the true story of a father and son diving team with expository material on the technical and physical challenges of scuba diving at great depths.  His descriptions of cave and wreck diving give the reader the sensation of being there.  The author describes his own nearly fatal accident as well as the deaths of the father and son team.  Their story has the flavor of a Greek tragedy, a predictable fate resulting from high-risk behavior.  The author's descriptions of personal interactions within this sporting sub-culture are sometimes more than is needed, particularly when he invents dialogue for conversations he did not hear.	2002-04-02

Musicant generally succeeds in his narrative of the Spanish-American war.  A specialist in naval history, Musicant gives particularly close attention to the naval battles at Manila and Santiago de Cuba.  His description of the gallant but hopeless attempt by the Spanish fleet to escape from Santiago is gripping.  Other striking sections describe the chaos of the American embarkation at Tampa and the suffering of American troops investing Santiago.  In other parts of the book, the detailed accounts of military politics and preparations may lead many readers to skip ahead.  The most disappointing part of the book is the last chapter titled &quot;Empire,&quot; a very abbreviated commentary on &quot;the dawn of the American century.&quot;  The book is reasonably well served by its few maps and its black and white photographs.	2002-03-26

Her involvement in a research project leads her into danger, beginning with a bear's attack on her tent.  A teenage boy disappears; his stepmother's mutilated body is found the next day.  False leads accumulate.  Most readers will not anticipate the ending, except to imagine that it involves a bear.

The publisher should be thanked for bringing together works scattered around a large number of museums, and for giving us a finely produced art book.  Even fans of Winslow Homer will not have seen most of these paintings, which may represent the summit of American watercolors.

Far more than most historians, Thomas explores the interconnections among the leading personalities, both Spanish and Mexican, giving the reader a feeling for the noble and the devious aspects of these sixteenth century people.  Politics and the exercise of power emerge as major themes.  The author brings out the contingency of history through his analysis of key events that might have gone another way.  There was nothing inevitable about Cortes' ultimate success; if he had not been so clever and ruthless, he might have ended up as a human sacrifice in an Aztec temple.  As it was, more than half of the conquistadors died, a casualty rate that no modern army would tolerate.  The six hundred page text is supplemented by useful appendices.

The author, a professor of archaeology at Oxford, believes that the Atlantic Ocean profoundly influenced the psychology and culture of those who lived on its edge.  In many cases, they interacted more with each other than with peoples living in the interior of the continent; the seas became a link rather than a barrier.  Maps of trade routes and archaeological finds illustrate these connections.  The photographs, many of them in color, are first class.

As is the case with other exhaustively researched biographies, this one makes its subject appear less heroic than legend implies.  Though Henry did sponsor the early Portuguese exploration of the West African coast, his motives were commercial and religious rather than scientific.  Russell, describing Henry's failures as well as his successes, concludes that the Prince was essentially a man of the late middle ages, not the Renaissance.  Nonetheless, Henry initiated the astonishing adventure of a small country extending its reach around the world.	2002-02-25

The author's proposed result is a Europe dominated by the Pope and his supporters, who suppress advances in science and technology.  By the twentieth century, England still is in a quasi-medieval state, its cities linked by steam-powered road trains, its messages communicated by semaphores.  Supernaturalism still influences perceptions and behavior.  The bulk of the book consists of the separate stories of six major characters, each illuminating different facets of this alternate world.  Some of these tales are beautifully and poignantly written.

The two government agents drawn into this case are Native Americans involved with each other in a complex and difficult relationship.  The author shows off his knowledge of anthropology and Northwest Indian tribes, making mysticism part of the story.  Things move along smartly for the first eighty per cent of the book, with additional violence, several suspects, and lots of misdirection.  Unfortunately, the concluding chapters seem overdone (how many anthropologists live in mansions with Bat Caves beneath them?)  Don't be misled by the jacket blurb comparing this to Tony Hillerman's work.  Mitchell's work is more hard-edged, violent, and sometimes gruesome.  The conclusion is politically correct but lacks the moral weight of Hillerman's best work.	2002-02-07

In this case, the complexities Robinson introduces into his mysteries generally work well.  Banks' search for the missing daughter of his boss leads into a series of unanticipated complications, including murder. His investigation points to different suspects at different times.  The boss man's reaction to Banks' lunch with the missing girl (who turns up dead that night) seems strangely muted. Banks' on and off girl friend, another police detective, is treated sympathetically but is not essential to the story. The epilogue seems tacked on. Other than that, the book is a good -- and long -- read.	2002-02-06

Turner, in preparation for writing a biography. The story develops very slowly; much of the material is about the small events of everyday life, unconnected to the mystery. Most readers will find themselves flipping pages to look for some sort of action, or at least meaningful clues.  The revelations that appear after three hundred pages are not worth the wait for anyone without a deep interest in, and knowledge of, English cultural history.	2002-01-31

Their major characters are afflicted by melancholy, and sometimes by fatalism. The reader feels the weight of centuries of Western European history, and deeply rooted Catholicism. Women have played secondary roles in these male-centered books. <br />One gets the sense that Perez-Reverte made some adjustments when he wrote The Nautical Chart. This tale of suspense, centered on a search for a sunken treasure, is driven by a mysterious and treacherous woman. The male protagonist, a disgraced merchant marine officer, is both seduced and taken in by her plan. He would be a sympathetic loser if he were not so violent.  Perez-Reverte's language (as translated from Spanish) seems richer than in his previous novels. The book makes heavy use of nautical terminology, generally with good effect but occasionally with dubious accuracy. One wishes that Perez-Reverte had left out the silly acronymic pearls of wisdom in the sailor's mind. Still, he is a distinctive writer.	2002-01-22

The authors raise Big Questions in astronomy, planetary evolution, geology, climatology, ecology, and biological evolution, reminding us of how interdisciplinary the extraterrestrial life debate really is. The vast array of subjects they address could make this book an ideal discussion text for a course designed to introduce non-scientists to scientific issues and methods. The book, at least in its hardback edition, has an uncrowded format that makes it easy to read.<br />Ward and Brownlee accumulate a lengthy series of arguments in support of their position that, while simple life may be relatively common, complex life is rare. At first glance, these arguments seem persuasive. However, a closer reading reveals that the authors sometimes tilt the debate in their favor by choosing the argument that best supports their case even when the evidence is very limited or ambiguous, e.g. their statement that plate tectonics \\"may be vanishingly rare in the Universe as a whole.\\" How can they know this when our sample is limited to our own solar system? Sometimes, the authors make unsupported blanket generalizations, e.g. \\"On every planet, sooner or later, a planetary catastrophe can be expected that either seriously threatens the existence of animal life or wipes it out altogether.\\" Stating that \\"it just seems to have been by chance that our Jupiter formed as it did\\" is hardly scientific. Oddly, after stating that SETI is a futile effort if their hypothesis is correct, the authors go on to say that \\"There probably are other civilizations in the galaxy that have radio telescopes.\\" In the end, the fundamental limitation to such arguments is that they are based on the only biosphere we know -- our own. This is summed up in the authors' statement that \\"It appears that Earth got it just right.\\" Life as we know it may not exhaust all the possibilities.<br />There are some errors. Venus does not always present the same face to the Sun. Nicholas Copernicus was Polish, not Danish. Frank Drake's equation was developed for a meeting held in 1961. One hopes that the authors will clean up these details for a second edition.	2002-01-22

The protagonist is the police detective responsible for solving these crimes. Though he works hard at his job, he makes believable mistakes, particularly because of incomplete information from others and because of his own erroneous assumptions. The complications of his personal life don't help. The book initially succeeds in luring the reader into the same false lead to the killer. As the story develops, the identity of the real killer becomes increasingly obvious. There is a bit too much dialogue about police business. American readers may find the compulsive smoking and drinking somewhat retro.	2002-01-08

The principal characters have backgrounds in the OSS of World War Two. Beginning his story with a man suffering from amnesia, Follett works through the plot in a reliably workmanlike way, but without much flair. The purported consequences of a launch failure seem wildly exaggerated; failures were common in the early days of the space program, but did not cause the U.S. to give up on competing with the Soviet Union.

The setting updates a tired science fiction idea -- an inhabited world miles under the surface of the Earth -- without adding much of interest.

He then proceeds to wander through a series of brief histories without chronological order, giving disproportionate attention to a man who may or may not have lived in Amalfi, Italy. Aczel is at his best in capsule histories of maritime activity, but is frustratingly unsystematic in his chronologies and his descriptions of how the compass is used. He mentions the Global Positioning System, but does not tell us how it works. The figure titled &quot;how the magnetic compass works&quot; is misleading, as it shows the axis of the Earth's magnetic field coinciding with the Earth's axis of rotation. One gets the impression of a hastily written book.	2002-01-03

Moxham discovers that British imperialists of the 19th century built a man-made barrier more than two thousand miles long, reaching across the Indian subcontinent. This hedge was designed to prevent the smuggling of salt from parts of India with low salt taxes to the area of Bengal, where salt taxes were very high. As Moxham expands his research into the history of this barrier, he discovers with growing horror the impact of imperial revenue policy on the lives of ordinary Indians, many of whom died because they could not afford the salt they needed in their diets. This previously neglected aspect of British imperial history makes one wonder how many other horrors lie buried in the dry pages of the Empire's official journals. Moxham, who writes in simple, declarative language, sometimes devotes too much space to the details of his encounters with modern-day Indians, though some of those encounters are charming. It is unfortunate that his book does not include a single photograph, such as one of the remaining piece of hedge he found.  Michael Michaud, Vienna, Austria	2002-01-02

Goetzmann, one of America's most prominent historians of the West, writes in a lively style. At just over one hundred pages, the main text is an easy read. The eight maps are helpful.

The author, who has read deeply into primary sources in Spanish, explains the intellectual questions he is addressing, particularly concerning cross-cultural communication and the use of symbols. He concludes that the Spanish advantage lay more in those areas than it did in military technology. While the book is predictably critical of Spanish treatment of the Indians, it also persuades the reader that Hernan Cortez was a very clever man.

The book begins with general material on the California coast including a brief history, weather, wildlife, outdoor adventures, camping, a calendar of events, tips on what to pack, and advice to senior travelers, women traveling alone, gay and lesbian travelers, even foreign travelers.  Each region of the California coast is introduced with a brief overview and capsule history, followed by details about scenic wonders, parks, beaches, hotels, restaurants, campgrounds, sports, shopping and nightlife.

This short book addresses the psychological aspects of ocean voyaging. Individual chapters draw conclusions about such subjects as a skipper's leadership and the dynamics of groups confined to small spaces for long periods of time. The book intersperses essays with three famous cases of failure: the Bligh mutinies, the Apollonia murders, and the suicide of Donald Crowhurst. The authors give particular emphasis to single-handed sailing. Each chapter ends with references that can be used for further reading. This book is useful as far as it goes, but could have covered a much wider sampling of psychology at sea. The authors are very British in their outlook, saying little about non-European sailors. Except for the Bligh mutinies, the book focuses almost exclusively on the post World War Two period. One wishes that the book had addressed more voyages from the great ages of exploration.	2001-11-06

The author has researched a wide variety of sources, collecting many examples of events that took place during sieges.  These stories, ranging  from amusing to horrifying, are told in a very readable way.  Unfortunately, the book is weak on systematic analysis.  Not until page 241 does the author begin describing siege weapons and techniques in a comparative way.  Many of the illustrations from the medieval period are small and not well-reproduced, making it difficult for the reader to see details.  There are not enough plans of castles and fortresses to illustrate the author's points.  The book also follows the unfortunate modern trend of using inadequate maps composed of lines and dots, with no indication of terrain features.

This thoughtfully plotted murder mystery, set in a small village in a remote area of England, seems slow-moving at first. The characters are country and small town people who speak simply. There are no car chases, no gunfights, not even a corpse. But the gathering momentum of the story draws you in. The protagonist, a young police officer determined both to do his duty and to be morally right, successfully prosecutes the local squire for murder. But all is not as it seems. The well-meaning detective has been led astray. Near the end of the book, he is presented with the shocking but morally defensible truth.

An unsolved mass murder five years before has profoundly affected the people living in the nearest small town, some of whom act peculiarly on the anniversaries of that event. Drivers see a woman next to a disabled car, but all of them are too preoccupied to stop and help. She disappears, and her body later is found in the ocean. Good start! But the author confuses the story by introducing too many characters, including potential suspects, who do not emerge clearly as individuals. Because there is no trail of evidence for the reader to follow, the ending drops out of the sky.	2001-09-24

The author, a writer and oral historian with long experience in the Indian subcontinent, here describes his re-examination of the complex history of Buddhism in Tibet and India. He intersperses colorful chapters about traveling in Tibet among drier chapters on religious history. The mix does not quite work. While Allen's travel writing generally holds the reader's attention, only people with a serious interest in Asian religions would stay with the scholarly presentations all the way through. Even though I lived in South Asia for four years, I found the religious history heavy going. While the color photographs bunched in the center of the book are of good quality, I wished that they had covered more of the sites described by the author. Overall rating: three stars.	2001-09-18

Bruce Knecht here tells the story of the disastrous 1998 Sydney to Hobart yacht race, in which several yachts were sunk and six men died at sea. His very readable account focuses on only a few of the yachts and individual members of their crews, plus individual weathermen and rescue services personnel. This technique adds a personal dimension to the story, but also has its drawbacks. Two of the dead are mentioned as an afterthought, and many yachts that suffered severely from the violent weather are not mentioned at all.  Readers interested in sailing and navigation may find the book too focused on personalities, with too little attention to the interesting details of course planning, yacht design, and offshore technology.
