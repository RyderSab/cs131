Some of the topics covered in the book are shown below :  <br />Computer Security : 20 Things Every Employee Should Know <br /> <br /> <br />I. The CIA Triad :  security is wrapped around the fundamental concepts of : <br /> <br />A. Confidentiality <br />B. Integrity <br />C. Availability <br /> <br />II. Security Issues :  include dangerous areas of phishing and spyware. <br /> <br />A. Phishing :  is a form of identity theft, by misleading you to disclose your personal information.  Phony  e-mail from what appears to be legitimate business asks for updated info and directs you to what also looks like a legitimate site. <br />B. Spyware : programs that surreptitiously moniters users' actions and provides info to advertisers or steals accounts and passwords.  Can use your computer as launching pad for Internet attacks. <br />i. Often included in free downloads. <br />ii. Don't reply or click on links requesting personal info <br />iii. Don't download programs by unfamiliar companies <br />iv. Secure your computer :  set your browser security level to the highest possible for your environment. <br />1. Block pop-ups <br />2. Maintain a personal firewall <br />3. Use anti-virus and anti-spywae software. <br /> <br />III. Identity Theft :  when an unauthorized party uses your name, ssn or other  <br />identifying personal information to commit fraud or other misdeed. <br /> <br />A. Is the fastest growing Internet crime <br />B. Be careful on phone and web <br />C. Moniter your finances regularly <br />D. Shred all papers <br />E. Most threat is from insiders- legitimate users with legitimate access doing illegitimate things. <br /> <br />IV. Passwords :  must be a mix on letters and numbers to avoid password cracking    <br />software. (i.e. John the Ripper) <br /> <br />V. Malware :  malicious software programs that are intended to compromise  <br />your computer system often through e-mails, attachments, music, etc. <br />  Categories include : <br /> <br />A. Viruses :  set of instructions that attach to legitimate software programs and damages through e-mails. <br />B. Spyware : described above <br />C. Worms :  Stand alone programs that make copies of themselves and travel  <br />throughout computer networks.  <br />D. Trojan Horse :  malicious software that tricks users into thinking it is  <br />Harmless when in reality there is a dangerous program embedded inside another. <br /> <br />VI. Telecommuting or Remote Access :  Beware because the level of security  <br />outside the office is usually not the same. <br /> <br />A. Encrypt confidential data <br />B. Use a personal firewall <br />C. Be attentive to physical security. cables to secure the laptop <br /> <br />VII. Reducing E-Mail Risks <br /> <br />A. Don't open any attachments on e-mail from people you know. <br />1. Watch out for \\"forward this to everyone you know\\" <br />B. Keep your anti-virus software up to date. <br /> <br />VIII. Incidental Personal Use of Corporate Computers and Resources :  use  <br />discretion since you can compromise the entire business network <br /> <br />A. The extent to which employees are permitted access to non-business sites <br />is a function of the organization.   <br />B. Never install software on any company computer <br />C. Never visit a chat room, and be careful with instant messaging <br /> <br />IX. Firewalls :  software installed on your PC that controls data exchanges  <br />between your computer and the remote site.  <br /> <br />A. Regularly update patches. <br /> <br />X. The Importance of Backing up Hard Drives :  hard drive provides the long <br />term memory of a system.  It isn't a question of \\"if\\" but \\"when\\" they will crash.   <br /> <br />A. Create a schedule for backup and encryption at least once a month. <br />B. Take care to back up data properly <br />C. Store backups confidentially ( encrypted) <br /> <br />	2005-10-11

However as a scientist the most important lesson for me is that every advance comes down to the persistent efforts of one or two people. <br /> <br />The book was given to me and I am already planning on giving it to others.	2005-10-10

The author uses security generically, blending physical security and information security. Most people do not do that, but I think Patterson is simply a year or two ahead of his time. <br /> <br />The first 1/3 of the book was a bit of a waste for me, sort of a know thyself without little exercises. Then you hit the good stuff. <br /> <br />All Americans should read page 105 at least twice. This is also where the value of this book becomes apparent, I will read this section at least one more time. I don't know how much credence I would put in the Mapping Security Index (MSI), where the author tries to quantify the ROSI of doing business in a particular part of the world or another, but the annecdotal bits are great. I have a much better understanding of why my own company has had such an odd experience doing business in Europe.  <br /> <br />If you are an American and you have an IT security position with a company doing business in the wider world ( and who doesn't) then I recommend this book.  I also recommend a movie called the Coca Cola Kid.  It is a bit off color, but it can really help explain why we make the mistakes we make.	2005-10-10

I have passed this around to some of students and fellow SANS instructors and tried to get some of their feedback as well. <br /> <br />The greatest contribution this book makes is a discussion of organization structure, who should report to who and why. This is something that has been desparately needed in the industry and if this book is successful in the marketplace, I would like to see some additional research and have this already excellent resource expanded. <br /> <br />The job descriptions are also wonderful, we have many names for  the same position and I would hope that over time, this book can help us develop a common terminology. <br /> <br />Who needs this book? It is designed to be licensed to organizations and as a rough rule of thumb, any organization with an IT department of 25 people or more could benefit from this book.	2005-10-03

In that respect it is second only to Dan Verton's Black Ice and it covers areas Black Ice does not. <br /> <br />There are some excellent nuggets including, the danger of backhoes to the network infrastructure ( that happened to me three times when I used to help provide networks, but I had forgotten just how pesky those can be), a consideration of the vulnerabilities of the power grid ( can't run computers without power) and a fantastic consideration of issues related to fiber. <br /> <br />The author is a product of the University of Florida's legendary Geography program so as you would imagine, the maps in the book are excellent at conveying information. <br /> <br />The bad news: <br />The book is really a dissertation, there is no developmental editor and it shows. You have to work past bad writing. <br /> <br />There is an assumption the reader has read all of the same papers the author has. I had read all of the government papers, but only a fraction of the rest so it was very hard to follow the author's thoughts. <br /> <br />Technical errors, a few of them concern me, such as the statement terrorist have never used computers to kill people. The hacked PBX in the Madrid bombing, the cyber cafe's in India; it is true that is just command and control, but it is part of killing people. Also cell phones are actually just wireless computers and they are used as part of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Also, the comment about Cisco routers not able propagate an attack concerns me, after all, they are computers as well and it is possible to exploit their processor through flaws in IOS.  However, I might be too picky, this might be semantics and since this is a dissertation, people far more educated have reviewed it. <br /> <br />The bottom line, this is not an easy read, but if you are in the risk analysis business, you should consider investing the time to study this bookand read some of the papers it references, you can count on me doing the same!	2005-10-03

Hoglund and Butler are true authorities on this subject and yet they never brag, instead they focus on helping the rest of us understand what is possible and exactly how it can be done. <br /> <br />Once again, the Addison-Wesley team demonstrates excellence, I found a couple of sentences that could benefit from a rewrite, but no grammar or spelling errors.  The charts and code examples are done well and the layout never detracts from the message. <br /> <br />I enjoyed learning about the VICE, patchfinder 2 and Rootkit Revealer tools and can't wait to run them on some of the older laptops in the company that have been used as loaners. I expect that will be revealing! <br /> <br />This was the clearest explanation I have ever seen as to how networking is managed using the Transport Data Inferface.  Even so, it still left me just a bit \\"hungry\\" and I hope this section is expanded in the second edition of this book. <br /> <br />What impressed me the most though was when the authors reached the limits of their knowledge, after all, this is a developing art and no one understands everything, with areas such as microcode update they simply and frankly stated that. <br /> <br />Clear, pragmatic, authoritative, what's not to like, buy this book.	2005-08-16

Wotring and Potter take the reader from a definition of integrity monitoring and fundamental principles to the pragmatic \\"how to\\" implement a monitoring capability - step by step.  They clearly have a wealth of experience shown by their tips on what to do and what not to do.  If you are considering Osiris or Samhain, this book is invaluable!

As I read it the burning question in my mind was, would What Color Is Your Parachute be a better tool?  I actually pulled my two year old copy of Parachute off the shelf and it is a better tool. <br /> <br />Still the book deserves a flip through if you have a chance to pull it off your neighbor's shelf or check it out from a library. My favorite chapters were 3 and 4, if there is any chance you might be looking for a job, don't miss those.	2005-07-14

I read this in one shot on a 6.5 hour flight to Kauai against monster headwinds.  Since then I have picked it up and read sections and tried to make changes in my company based on what I learned.  Thanks to Lindstrom's book, I can certainly tell you I am on a brand journey. <br /> <br />I am sure every reviewer will mention Singapore Airlines.  We were holding a conference and I wanted to create that distinct SANS Institute smell.  So I bought five aromatic dispensers and test scents with names like \\"Ocean Feeling\\".  I had people stationed to observe the customers and make note of anything they said about smell.  Zero results.  Why?  The biggest reason is probably the volume of air in a modern conference center is several orders of magnitude greater than a jet. <br /> <br />We are working on the tips the author gives for music, here I am convinced he is right, I cannot listen to Rhapsody in Blue without thinking about United Airlines. <br /> <br />Without this book, I would have thought brand was a logo and picking some colors and maybe a jingle.  My eyes are opened, and at this point I know it will be a long journey, but I am sure I will refer to the book again and again.  Highly recommended for any business owner or organizational executive.	2005-05-07

The weight and form are perfect.  There is enough scripture to read that you don't have to lug your bible in your carryon if you are over 50 and can't read a pocket bible.  I have found I can keep my world appointments and track prayer life as well.  At first, I felt wrong using the journal for secular items like work until I remembered, hey, I am just one person!  They have great sections on parts of the world to pray for specific needs. <br /> <br />It has held up well, I travel constantly, so it has gotten beat around. <br /> <br />Actually there is only one negative, sometimes when life gets going too fast, those days where you skip writing in the journal are all too obvious.	2005-05-07

I try to always give 4 stars, but this was a bit choppy to read.  Also, the statement on page 17, where God asks \\"How many people did you bring with you?\\" probably isn't scripturally correct. <br /> <br />That said, it is a useful book if you go through the exercises and it is a great pointer for further information available from New Hope. <br /> <br />Also Wayne Cordeiro's approach to leadership has clearly been forged through real world experience.  It is funny how similar the books are from the great leaders that have truly been there, done that.  And yet, each time you read the importance of vision, mission, goals with metrics to ensure you are on target, the way each author spins it adds another nugget or six. <br /> <br />I particularly enjoyed the discussion of why a leader must fashion his own trumpet based on Numbers 10:3-5.  It is so true we much each develop our own style. <br /> <br />Another great bit of wisdom is the section beginning on page 203, \\"To Change Things, Tell Them What Will Not Change\\".  It is one of the better treatments of change management I have ever encountered. <br /> <br />Another church based leadership book that would go hand in glove with this is Finzel's Top Ten Mistakes Leaders Make. I think of that as the \\"ouch\\" book, as in \\"Ouch! Doctor, it hurts every time I do this\\". <br /> <br />	2005-05-07

However, I have never seen so much information in one place on the subject of passive reconnaissance. Who needs horror movies?  Read this book and follow it up with Black Ice by Verton and you probably will not sleep for a week! <br /> <br />If you work in information warfare, this should be mandatory reading!  If you are responsible for very high value targets like Walmart's dataprocessing, or Intel's or Citibank's it is imperative that you read Zalewski's work page by page. <br /> <br />I don't think the book will work for those new to networking and  technical security.  It almost could but the book's layout reads more like a thesis, or an IEEE journal paper than a helpful book that teaches and equips.  I do this stuff for a living and had to stop several times and say, \\"OK what is the point\\". <br /> <br />If this goes to second printing or second edition, I recommend the use of tools such as text boxes and callouts to make the main points easier to follow. <br /> <br />Chapter 9 was the biggest disappointment.  The author is truly an expert and could have taught the reader so much more about the interpretation of the header fields. <br /> <br />However, those are nits, no book can be perfect.  The book is well worth the money for the right reader!  I am glad I got to read it and will recommend it for the SANS conference book store!	2005-04-25
US	34698447	R1PAI6HXWSGUTR	0321227239	153407673	Troubleshooting Linux Firewalls	Books	5	14	16	N	N	Best of breed	The Shinn brothers are legendary in information security, so when I saw this book, I made sure to put it on the top of my airline reading list. <br /> <br />If you ever watch someone closely that is trying to troubleshoot a computer, network, or firewall, you quickly realize fault detection and root cause determination are skills very few people have.  I watch people change two things and reboot, or try the last thing they just tried again and just shake my head. <br /> <br />The book is not just about troubleshooting, it includes setup, network theory, and proper design as well. However, chapter 4 should be required reading for anyone that is allowed near a computer with privileged access, windows or unix.  If this book gets revised I would love to see the troubleshooting chapter expanded, that is critially important information.	2005-04-20

Then they go into the how to do it. <br /> <br />If you have kids and computers, this is a must read.  My wife and I really struggled with the idea of respecting our kids privacy and so we set up the minimum possible monitoring at our house and tried to ensure our kid was briefed on internet safety. Even so, our son  was approached on the Internet at age 15 by a grown woman that wanted to meet him in real life.  I am glad we detected that before anything really serious happened.  Kids need a chance to grow up without that kind of help from adults. <br /> <br />Finally, it must be noted that anything this book teaches could be used in the workplace as well.  Managers should read Cyber Spying to understand what is possible.	2005-04-20

Every time Google Hacking gets further than three feet from my keyboard, I get up, find it, put it back by my side.  I first used the \\"recipies\\" in the book to locate intellectual property violations of SANS material.  Next, I went on a digital painting campaign and created over 150 images and used the book to help me find the raw source material.  Most recently, I have used the optimized searches the book shows one how to do to help with a research project. <br /> <br />Buy the book, try the searches, learn what is possible.  It wouldn't hurt to use the book for its intended purpose as well, to see what information about you, about your organization is exposed on the Internet.	2005-01-26

It seems to have a bit of trouble finding its niche, most of the time it has the feel of a research paper, but from time to time there are amazingly practical tidbits.   If you are looking for a how to stop denial of service, step by step, buy the cup of coffee from Borders and leaf through the book and make your decision carefully. If you are a researcher in the USA interested in Internet protocols and US law and response, this is a must read, must have.  If you are truly seeking to understand what zombie style distributed denial of service is and is capable of, buy the book and read it three times.  My response team worked closely with one of the authors, David Dittrich from 1999 - 2001 and if there is a \\"been there, done that\\" individual when it comes to malicious code, he would be that person.  <br /> <br />This is not a book for a novice, but if you know your way around a network and know a bit about routing, there are a number of helpful illustrations and code segments that drive the points home. <br /> <br />I realize I gave the book three stars even though I liked it a lot and that is primarily because the book is much weaker in the two final chapters, 8 and 9.  You just can't throw issues like law, ethics, jurisdiction, evidence collection, and estimation of damages on the table, write a couple paragraphs and zoom on, someone could get hurt.  For the right reader, this can be a wonderful resource.	2005-01-26

There is a bit of arrogance, a tendancy to put down other security experts, but if you can look past that you have a great book. <br /> <br />It assumes a willingness to read technical material and sometimes, to be honest, I got lost in the cryptographic explanations. <br /> <br />I rate it five stars because this is a book about how to do things and I was able to follow along, it is just one step down from a true cookbook.  And I learned a lot and thank the authors for that, if you are responsible for wireless assessment, this is hands down the best book I have seen on the subject by some real \\"been there, done that\\" folks.	2004-12-04

The next 30 pages show the interface to security in the windows environment.  The real value for me as a reader started on page 65.

After reading the book, I bought a copy for everyone involved in the development of our next generation online training product at SANS.  As the book says, most organizations end up scrapping their first system and that is what we have just done.  After reading the book, I now know to focus on reusable learning modules and prioritize assessment.  From the book, I  learned make our new system employer centric first with mandatory skills triaining and assessment and second learner centric so that individuals have the tools to design and track their own individualized learning plans. <br /> <br />If you are creating some form of distance learning, buying this book and forcing yourself to read every word might save you a lot of money and heartache.	2004-12-04

This book will be most useful for US readers as expectations and laws vary across the world. <br /> <br />There are two questions an organization should ask about privacy: What is the cost of implementing a privacy program and what is the potential cost of not implementing a privacy program.  Cannon's book will appeal as much to managers and executives responsible for knowing the answers to those questions.  <br />  <br />The first third of the book provides an overview of privacy legislation and of technologies that are either privacy-enhancing or privacy-invasive, with suggestions for how to protect oneself from privacy intrusion. Chapter 4 is devoted to the subject of managing privacy for Windows products which can be helpful to administrators and consumers.  It covers the privacy settings for XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Office 2003, and Windows Media Player 9. Consumers and privacy advocates alike will find a wealth of information here about what privacy technologies exist and how to use them. <br /> <br />In the next fifty pages, Cannon discusses how to build a privacy organizational infrastructure and a privacy response center; and the reminder of the 350-page book is devoted to walking developers through the steps necessary to actually build privacy functionalities into their solutions. It is here that Cannon delves into more technical topics of interest to developers building privacy-enhancing technologies and to companies looking to include privacy awareness into the way products are built. <br /> <br />P3P is something I have struggled with on the SANS Institute's own web page.  At present, it seems like an organization is safer not implementing it and the bookwas very helpful for me to better grasp the issues surround electronic enforcement of privacy.	2004-12-02
US	34698447	R2Q3YNECLIVT0B	1587051176	271163359	Designing Network Security (2nd Edition)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A complete survey of network security and more	This is a big book, 745 pages, a bit about almost every topic in information security.  The advantage of a book like this is that if you want to know three paragraphs about a security term that you are not familiar with, you can find it.  The disadvantage of these survey type books is that they do not usually give you enough information to do anything.  <br />Though there are some spots especially in the first few chapters where this happens, Merike Kaeo, the author, quickly succeeds in making this a book that goes beyond telling the reader about things and begins to share how to do things on Cisco equipment which is far more valuable.  If you are a Cisco network engineer or administrator and are interested in learning more about information security this is probably a good book for you.  I think this book would also benefit a manager or someone with purely theoretical information security knowledge that wants to be able ask technical people pragmatic questions.<br />The Voice over IP chapter was one of the clearest explanations I have seen, however a bit more of a warning about security, changing standards and interoperability would have been appreciated.<br />When work begins on 3rd edition, I would suggest more focus on using routing and switching technology to segment the internal network so a worm infection does not take down the entire facility.

However, I am lazy and I like having the information I need at my fingertips with syntax that works the first time on the operating system I am using.<br />The authors and Addison Wesley are to be congratulated for the fantastic layout, the &quot;code&quot; examples stand out, they are pithy and illustrate the point.  The one exception to that is the IPsec VPN chapter.  Also, it is really easy reading for such a bone breakingly technical book.<br />I particularly enjoyed the PF chapter, it is a first rate treatment of firewalling, covers the bases nicely.  The backup chapter is also well done, but I would argue more strongly on behalf of level 0 (full) backups. It is a an important enough concept to get more than a sentence.  The introduction to systrace was wonderful.  I am not sure covering snort in 7 pages is a good idea, but the fundamentals are there. I know covering apache in 9 pages is asking for trouble since it tends to be internet reachable.<br />If you are looking for a platform with better networking capability than Linux, or if you are already running OpenBSD in anything other than a purely hobbyist fashion, you should strongly consider this book.	2004-04-20

Want to understand how hackers hide their tracks?  It's in here.  Need to know more about wireless security?  That's in here, too.  The chapter on reconnaissance is particularly interesting.  Another chapter, on social engineering, will make you re-examine your security in terms of the people in your own organization who can compromise that security.  That's one element many books fail to consider.  <br />Any infosec professional worth his or her salt already knows a lot of what you'll find in here.  But none of us knows everything; the authors aim to fill in the blanks in any professional's knowledge.  The great thing about this book is that you can instantly flip to the section on what you need to know more about and find clear, in-depth information.  If that's not enough, each topic includes a list of additional references to help you learn more.  <br />If I have any complaint about this book, it's the pages and pages of code.  How many of us actually read all that code when we encounter it in a book?  When code is needed to make a point, I'd like to see no more than ten - fifteen lines of it at a time with appropriate comments in the text.  If we really need the rest, it would be far more helpful in appendices at the back of the book, or, better yet, on a CD-ROM included with the book.  That said, this book is likely to become an indispensable reference for your library, and well worth the price.	2004-04-19

But this book deserves it.  It's written in a style that's as riveting as any suspense novel, while the material is as horrifying as Stephen King, and as useful as a roll of duct tape.  This is a book for knowledgeable IT people who may still be arrogant enough to believe that \\"it can't happen to me.\\" While many books work from the premise that hackers use back doors and other ways to enter into your system to do their damage, this book explains how it's your software, itself, that is really the weakest link in your security.  It takes you through a brief history of some spectacular software failures.  Then, it explains how hackers find the bad code that exists, with black, grey and white box techniques and then exploit the vulnerabilities they find.<br />We all know, there is plenty of bad code out there, for a variety of reasons that are explained quite well in this book.  Given market pressures and other factors, there is every reason to believe that the situation isn't going to improve significantly any time soon.  This book shows you real examples, albeit sometime code fragments of examples, of how to find and get into those \\"holes\\" in your software to do all kinds of damage.  Some people will ask, \\"But why would we want to have a text book out there to teach people how to do this stuff?\\"  The \\"bad-guys\\" know all this stuff, already.  If you don't, how can you possibly expect to avoid falling victim to them?  This is the information you need to fix what's wrong in software you are already using, and a glimpse into ways to help avoid problems in code that you write.  This is a good book, I think we will see better, more complete and pragmatic books in the future that take you through shell code exploits and repairing the heap step by step, but until then what a fun read!	2004-04-10

One of the gnawing concerns I live with is that my website will be hacked. I can't say this book made me feel better about that fear, but it brought to light a number of things to talk to my people about.  Using real-world examples, it explains the kinds of openings hackers look for, and the ways they exploit those openings to do their damage.  In some senses, this book is not just a warning, it is also a how-to for Internet security.  <br />The general premise of this book is that no one is safe from attack, and if you're not already a victim, that's only a matter your good luck so far.  Read this book.  Study it carefully.  Keep it on the nearest, most convenient bookshelf.  New kinds of attacks are being developed all the time.  But this book will prepare you for what's out there so far, and give you some insight into the kinds of things to watch for in the future.	2004-03-29

This is a how-to book clearly intended primarily for those who have already decided to install firewall 1 software on their systems.  There are several things I like about this book, not the least of which is the author's honest, straightforward approach to his subject matter.  <br />I also really like the extensive use of FAQ's to resolve many of the challenges likely to be encountered in implementing your firewall protection.  But what makes that especially helpful is the comprehensive table of contents listing just the FAQ's.  <br />My favorite chapter is the one devoted to planning your firewall system.  It's thorough, including all of the items that should be considered in the planning process.  For my money, this chapter alone is probably worth the cost of the book.  <br />My advice is to read this book before you start spending money on the software.  Follow all of the advice about planning.  Then use the book to help you make the most of what you buy.	2004-03-23

Sadly, I can't figure out who the target audience really is, who can benefit from this book.<br />There are books about things and books that teach how to do things, this is about things. It attempts to cover all of information security related to a network in under 400 pages and the result is too technical for managers and lacks the depth an implementor needs.  In the end it feels more like reading an expanded glossary than a book.<br />The author is clearly smart and well read, I liked the 3 page conclusion a lot and if that approach and tone were used througout the book this would be a great resource for decision makers that are not afraid of a bit of technical material.	2003-11-23

As a security focused manager the more I learn about steganography, the art of hiding messages, the more concerned I become about its security implications.  These techniques allow an individual to use secrecy in communications.<br />I am sure the book aids the investigator, but it helps a manager understand how secrecy has been used in the past and the present as well.  A tremendous amount of research must have gone into the book to be so comprehensive.  I was already familiar with S-tools and a few other picture file related techniques, but had never considered slight alterations of the space between letters and had never heard of Civil war quilts.  The beginning of the book is packed with technique after technique.<br />The author, Greg Kipper is to be congratulated for such clear writing especially considering how complex the subject gets.<br />The publisher, CRC Press, went the extra mile to create a very detailed table of contents so the reader can find what they need fast.<br />The bottom line, this book is an excellent coverage of the subject and yet they packed it into about 200 pages so it is 100% fluff free.<br />One concern and one wish.  The coverage of tools is a bit spotty, the links to stego tools seem to change rapidly and some of the tools do not even have a link.  If you can't find a tool you might try: [...] that is what I use.  I hope this goes to second edition and if so, my wish is that the author will beef up the detection chapter.  Greg does such a great job of showing how stego can and has been used in the real world, I would love more information about how I can protect myself and apply detective controls in my organization's network.	2003-11-21

The company I work for is moving more and more to wireless to provide connectivity to our customers.<br />In terms of understanding architecture, and the cryptography behind the security protocols this was my favorite book.  My favorite chapter was the how WEP works and why it doesn't.  The writing was clear and the explanations were accurate.  I also loved chapter 15, that equipped me to explain why wireless networks are dangerous beasts with detail.<br />It is a tougher read than some of the other books on the subject, the good news is that you understand the cryptography, the bad news is you have to work through the pages with the crytography.<br />This is a good book and it is well worth the price.  Why did I give it 4 stars instead of 5?  It could improve in a couple areas.  I think it would have been a stronger, more focused work without chapters 2, 3, and 4.  Any reader that is willing to wade through the inner workings of TLS, TKIP or WPA doesn't need a security overview.  Also, I really wish more effort had been put into chapter 14, Public Wireless Hotspots.  It is good, it covers the fundamentals, but I finished the chapter without increasing my understanding of a question every reader of the book will have.  Do I dare check my (encrypted) email at a Starbucks or airport hot spot?  That said, I think with second edition the authors will have every chance to take the lead in the crowded field of 802.11 books.	2003-10-24

This book is an introduction to wireless with a general coverage of security and a privacy chapter glommed on dressed up as a wireless book.  Wireless is such a complex and important issue, that is just wrong to do. The afterword, the future of wireless is essentially content free.<br />The book is well written, well researched, uses layout and illustrations well and if you are a novice to information security is probably worth hauling on the plane to read. <br />However, even then beware, one of the major topics appears to be invented by the authors and is passed on as security craft.  The I-ADD section is a feature of the book.  I had never heard of I-ADD and I do not have a life, all I do is information security.  I tried to look it up with google, no results at least through the 3rd page.  I wrote ten of my friends in the field, no hits.  I tried to look it up in the &quot;bible&quot;, Dr. Matt Bishop's 1,000 page, five years in the making, Computer Security Art and Science.  I went through Wireless Security and Privacy's bibliography and while there might be a reference I missed, it certainly is not supported to the degree it should be to be so strongly featured in the book.  I completely agree that we need thought models to help understand the complex issues of information security, but it would be much more appropriate to use something standard such as Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) from BS7799/ISO-17799.<br />If you are in the risk management business, the targets and roles that are enumerated in chapter 9 could be worth the price of the book for your trade.<br />In general, if you are interested in wireless, I would pass on this one, but there is another book by the same major publisher, Pearson Press, How Secure Is Your Wireless Network? by Lee Barkin that is worth a look.	2003-09-30

The authors are quick to jump from a discussion of the issues to meta code and sample code, but that is a feature, not a bug to the book's intended audience of very sharp, (as opposed to very basic), well educated coders. I would like to have seen more of an effort to discuss testing, validation and assessment, but at just under 700 pages this is a focused work and a serious coverage of the hooks that make it possible to secure .NET.  (Of course that is assuming the underlying function calls are not riddled with buffer overflows and the like.  Blaster on a .NET scale is a pretty scary prospect.)<br />The bottom line, we are awash in bad code and the vulnerabilities that result are the fundamental reason there are so many exploits.  When you consider that in the scale of a federated system it is not a pretty thought.  Someday there will be building codes for software, but in the meantime, if you are a responsible citizen of this planet and you are involved in .Net development, buy your coders this book.  Invest the time to be able to quiz them and do so.  Make sure they understand the issues, especially with Chapters 18 and 19, ASP.NET and COM+.	2003-09-30

Mike has a gift to explain a topic well in the minimum number of words and I hope he continues to write on information technology topics and I look forward to his future books.<br />I had to give the book a low score, two stars, because it fails to meet its purpose. It purports to be a preparation guide for the GIAC GSEC exam series.  I wanted to evaluate the book to be sure the content can prepare students for the exam and in my opinion, it is not adequate for that task.<br />Since the book is useful at an outline level for reviewing the material, I will focus this review on the areas where I believe it falls drastically short in preparing you for the exams. MS Windows Security accounts for 1/7 of the GSEC exam. Sadly, the coverage in the book is apparently based on a very old version of the course. The best advice I can give you is read the course description for day 5 on the web and buy a good, up to date Windows 2000/XP book or two.<br />There is no coverage in the Prep Guide of the cookbook (hands on) material which is testable as of July 2003 students and beyond. There are hands on questions for every tool that is covered by the cookbook in the exam bank.<br />The wireless section, appendix B, is testable. I did not see coverage of wireless in the book.<br />The author speaks authoritatively from time to time about the nature or content of the exam. It is may be dangerous to do this. The exam is dynamically generated. Questions are pulled from subject buckets from an enormous bank of questions. No two exams are ever alike.<br />Finally, it is important to remember that the GSEC day books are over 2,000 pages and the Hands On cookbook is several hundred pages as well. It is impossible to fully cover that much material in 480 pages, even with a gifted author.<br />Stephen Northcutt - Director GIAC	2003-08-08

That said, this is another fine Sun Blueprint book, well written, clear, gives you exactly what you need to implement Open SSH.  I especially appreciate the troubleshooting chapter, after all since SSH is encrypted, troubleshooting is quite challenging.<br />The back of the book includes a series of example scripts, I don't normally appreciate page after page of code with no explanation other the the inline comments, but having set up SSH recently on my Mac, I know firsthand that examples can be very helpful. <br />The book doesn't cover PuTTy and is very thin on support for Windows clients, but if you are a Sun shop, this is just the ticket.  <br />The book also does not properly cover the many, many hazards of SSH.  If you run clear text password protocols (FTP, Telnet, r-utilities) you will surely die.  However, there have been a raft of vulnerabilities with SSH, especially version 1.  Beyond protocol problems, there are architecture issues by allowing encrypted pipes into your site that should be covered in detail. If there is a second edition of this book, I would recommend a &quot;Death by SSH&quot; chapter.	2003-07-28

Congratulations to the very knowledgeable author and reviewer team!  Thank you for sparing a rehash of how TCP works or a general survey of intrusion detection, focusing on what matters and sharing your hard earned Snort wisdom with us! <br />This is a book about Snort, not about intrusion detection.  You learn about all the parts of Snort, how to write a rule and tons and tons of auxiliary tools.  Would I recommend this book to someone already running Snort?  Yes!  Would I recommend this book to someone considering deploying an IDS?  Heck yes!  In fact, if you attempt to deploy Snort on a production network without reading this book you should be instantly teleported out of your organization and into the \\"welcome to Walmart\\" greeter position at the nearest bigbox store of the world's largest corporation.<br />The book is laid out in the typical readable, user friendly, Syngress fashion including the FAQ at the end of the chapter.  I like that.<br />I have two very minor complaints ( this is really 4.99999 stars instead of 5).  The multiple pages of code without explanation in the back of the book should have been omitted or heavily commented.  And I do not think sending the CDROM with the book was a good idea, Snort gets updated every couple weeks and the authors themselves \\"strongly recommend\\" getting the latest code from snort.org on page 75.<br />Well worth the money, if you are even thinking about running an IDS, especially Snort, get the book now!	2003-06-26

I am guilty of that myself, I was modifying kernal code on ATT SYS V r 2 back in 1984, so I confess to being pretty skeptical about Unix Unleashed, but I must applaud the authors, this is a wealth of knowledge.  And when I finished reading the book, I was glad I invested the time, it was a humbling reminder that just because I can spell &quot;su&quot;, that doesn't mean I know everything about Unix.<br />The writing is very clear, think of the book as the polar opposite of a man page.  They use charts, illustrations and other devices to convey difficult ideas.  The book has been laid out well and that is critically important when you weigh in with over 1,100 pages.  There are only a few pages in the entire work that don't have a subsection heading.<br />This is a good book and quite servicable as it is,  I think it could even be used as a text in a semester long college course on Unix.  When this goes to 5th edition I would recommend losing about 100 pages and not try to cover things like Snort, it is better to do one thing well and the Unix coverage is excellent.  I would also like to see a bit more effort in meeting the promise of the title in the Towards Better Sysadmin section of the book, this is such an important topic and Andy and Robin clearly have the knowledge, experience and writing ability to help us in our journey to be better system administrators.	2003-06-26

This book deserves a place on the small shelf within arm's reach.<br />If you are a manager, before you ever make a decision, or approve a policy, look the topic up, there is a good chance you will see something you didn't think of.<br />Let me give you an example, our company used to have a fairly long Non-Diclosure Agreement (NDA) prepared by our attorney for a specific purpose.  However, we decided to create a simpler, general purpose NDA for all 1099 contractors.  The lawyer created it and before I approved it I checked it against the book.  I found three items that really should have been in our NDA that we would have missed, thank you Mr. Wood!<br />If you are a techie do you need this book?  Sure, because everything we do as a techie or engineer has liability implications for the company.  Each topic is very clear, concise, and well thought out.  It takes a few seconds to look it up, about two minutes to read the section and that investment is well worth your time.<br />Yes, this is an expensive book, however, it is worth the investment, every organization should have at least one copy.

I think that was my favorite part of the book, I know a lot of people are starting to think of 911 as old news, but I am not one of them.  Giuliani issues a call to action to protect your information asset's for the nation¹s good.  I started into the book quite excited.<br />The first three chapters say the same thing over and over again but with different word patterns. The gist is we¹re under attack and you better get ready for it. When your computers go down, so will your business. True, but that could be covered with one paragraph, and perhaps a couple war stories.<BR> <BR>Ernst and Young's experts Mark W. Doll, Saiay Rai and Jose Granado propose that we can achieve homeland security with their 3 R¹s of the Security Agenda: Restrict, Run and Recover(SM).  While it certainly is not that simple in practice, I really like the catchy slogan, it is perfect for communicating with senior executives. <br />The writing style is a bit dry, the repetition and lack of depth hurt the work, but the topic is very important.  It does a great job of convincing a CEO class executive that they need a well founded security program.  It just doesn't help them get it started.  I want to be very specific with my concerns since I am scoring the book lower that the other (mostly anonymous) reviewers.  I am a senior manager, the target audience for the book.  People ask me for decisions or try to sell me on their product or solution all the time.  It isn't that they tell me lies, they just do not give me all the information I need to make an informed decision.   After a while you learn to be very careful about making decisions without all the facts.  This work needs more case studies, more specific, proven examples.  It also needs more takeaways, information I can use.  Granted it is very unfair to ask E&amp;Y to give away intellectual capital that took them a lot of sweat and blood to create, but at least give the reader enough information to assess our condition and understand what the next steps are.<br />I encourage Ernst and Young to do a second edition with some \\"show me the beef\\" hardnosed technical reviewers and produce a great book.	2003-06-16
US	34698447	R2N08JNJ9IEXUP	0131118293	147681033	Inside the Security Mind: Making the Tough Decisions	Books	4	12	13	N	N	A Step Out Of The Trenches	I really enjoyed the first six chapters, especially chapter 3 and 4 and I really feel those 122 pages are worth the price of the book and then some.  After chapter 6, Inside the Security Mind morphs into yet another everything you already know about information security book.<br />There is treasure, rare treasure in the front of the book.  Kevin Day spares us a review of risk management and TCP and instead lays out the information battlescape better than anyone I have seen in a long time. The only other person to shed light on this concept was Dorothy Denning in her classic, Information Warfare &amp; Security.  But where Dorothy while comprehensive, was a bit boring with list after list, Kevin Day takes Inside the Security Mind in an entirely different direction.  <br />His words are like a painter with bold brush strokes; he outlines information security in a way that forces even the most hardened techie to stop and rethink the world we live in. When was the last time when you heard about the four virtues of information security? When was the last time you read about virtue for that matter? Something about the philosophical approach of the first six chapters of the book reminds me of The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene, but where Power is amoral and more than a bit dark and frightening, Security Mind grabs the high ground and doesn't let go.<br />Every security manager and technical administrator can benefit from chapter 4, the eight rules of security.  Yes we each knew that information at one time, but are we applying those rules all the time?  Kevin outlines the concepts and he has me thinking about my data center architecture and some of the design choices we have made recently.<br />My advice is to read chapter 3 and 4 at least three times.  Within 24 hours most of the knowledge you learned from an initial reading is lost, but if you read it again you start to build knowledge you can use for the long term.  I would suggest that chapters 1, 2, 5, 6 are each worth reading twice.  The rest of the book is certainly worth reading once, but if you have more than ten security titles on your bookshelf you will read most of the information in the back half of the book before. <br />If you are considering buying a book titled Inside the Security Mind, you are probably familiar with AF Col. John Boyd's Observation, Orientation, Decision Action (OODA) loops.  The diligent reader of Inside the Security Mind has an opportunity to program the orientation segment of their minds.  This opportunity does not come along every day!  Carpe Diem, Buy em and Read em!	2003-04-25

The book tries to do a review TCP, the principles of information security and what firewalls are and by trying to cover too much fails to meet the promise of its title.  It doesn't cover personal firewalls in any depth, but it does have an important purpose.  There are a number of small business and home office owners that simply do not understand the importance of a firewall or a personal firewall.  The language in the book is clear, friendly and approachable.  The work is designed to be understood and is a quick read, which is important for a small business owner that will only invest so much time learning about firewalls and security. I learned about a firewall I had never heard of, Kerio, but the book doesn't cover Tiny, one of the most important personal firewalls.  For someone in information security already, this is probably two stars, but for someone with a small office wondering what a firewall is and if they need one, I would be very comfortable recommending this book.  Lisa Yeo has the potential to be a great writer, she seems to have a knack for covering a topic with just the number of words needed. I would encourage her to try again, personal firewalls is a topic that needs to be covered, but next time do it with a strong technical review team.<br />The book layout is one of the better jobs I have seen, the font is easy on the eyes and large enough to actually read.  They do a fascinating trick where code examples and notes are allowed to extend further into the left margin than the text of the book.  This serves to break up the text and draws your attention to the figures, code examples and notes.	2003-04-25
US	34698447	R30PZK7KB8YB2X	013101112X	677346516	IT Security: Risking the Corporation	Books	4	1	2	N	N	What your CXO needs to know	I read this book on the plane flight home from a SANS workshop called Audit and Security Controls that Work.  About 25 percent of the workshop participants were CTO/CSOs from best in class IT shops, companies like Verisign. Tripwire and Bear Stearns.  Needless to say, most IT shops are not best in class, and the rich question the second stringers are asking is: what are the first steps to improve.  <br />The first step is senior management commitment to security.  The problem is that CEOs don't read router configuration files and network administrators don't communicate well in terms of business goals.  There is a huge communication gap and very few people are comfortable in both environments.  The author of this book, Linda McCarthy is one of those few people.  She has written a book that could help turn the lights on for a manager.  I really like the subtitle, \\"Risking the Corporation\\".  That is what managers do when they make decisions that do not take security into account.  That is a bit scary since only one manager, the CEO, is actually authorized to risk the corporation.  This book can help department heads and CIO types understand the limits to their authority and the need to practice due diligence.<br />I like the use of headings, the sections are only a paragraph or two long so that a senior manager can get nuggets out of the book in as little as five minutes and if they can invest a half hour or two on a plane they can learn enough to begin to get them to rethink their assumptions.    I liked the use of quote pages, where there is a quote from a famous person in information security in large type, but the quotes themselves were not chosen with the care they should have been.   If there is a second edition, I would recommend removing chapter 12, if a senior manager runs into a chapter of nothing but unix commands which they do not understand they will be irritated.  The book is well written and very digestible up to that point, and then boom, in a flash weundo much of the good that has been done.  <br />This is a nice set of stories, it is more appropriate for management than any other security book I can remember seeing.  Buy a copy, give it to your boss the day she is leaving on travel.  Ask her to read it on the way home and to schedule a half hour to discuss it when she gets back.  Your organization will be much better off if you do.	2003-04-08
US	34698447	R2FP6ZFOMPMEP	1931836698	762573100	Special OPs: Host and Network Security for Microsoft, Unix, and Oracle	Books	5	25	28	N	N	The CISO or Auditor Survival Guide	Yesterday morning I spent the better part of an hour in an interview with a reporter. The topic: \\"If you were giving advice to a brand new security officer, a CSO, or CISO, about how to avoid being fired in their first year, what would you tell them?\\"  After the interview I started to read Special Ops and if there was any way to go back in time I would have told that reporter, tell them to buy Special Ops and read it at least three times.  <br />I normally classify books into a couple of categories; there are books about things and books that tell you how to do things.  Special Ops weighs in at a thousand plus pages and covers Windows XP, 2000, Outlook, Exchange, Unix, Security Policy and much more, yet does not fall neatly into either category.  So what category is Special Ops?<br />Dan Lynch, a founder of the Internet and the founder of Interop once used a term, Bogon filter, years before BGP was invented.  Bogon, apparently, was a synonym for blarney if you get my drift.  Technical people will tell managers and auditors almost anything because they are pretty sure they can get away with it.  The chapters in this book are written by brilliant people; they are packed with useful information.  You will not learn enough about securing XP to hang out your shingle, but if you read that chapter a couple times you will certainly be on solid ground to determine if the consultant you are considering hiring to secure your XP systems knows enough to even get near your computer facility.  The auditor that invests the time to read this book cover to cover three times should be given a t-shirt that says \\"Fear me\\".  Special Ops can help you develop a bogon filter better than any other single book I have seen on the marketplace.<br />Chapter 18, Creating Effective Corporate Security Policies, is one of the most fascinating chapters in the book.  Though obviously it covers material that can be found in other places, the authors clearly knows their stuff; it is pure pragmatic advice.  The warnings ring true and the links are there.<br />Though content is the most important ingredient of a technical book and Special Ops is packed with content, layout is also important.  The book was happy to lay flat within the first four minutes I was playing with it.  The fonts are well chosen and large enough to be readable, the paper is substantial.  I do have two complaints regarding layout. After the first reading, it will primarily serve as a reference book, so running a camouflage overprint across half of the table of contents was less than brilliant.  The same goes for the silly FAQ stamp on top of the questions.  Never intentionally make a book hard to read!  On the other hand, summary links for more information and an FAQ for every chapter show a real concern for the needs of the reader.   As always, just buying the book and putting it on the shelf will not make your systems and network more secure.  I have only met Erik Birkholz twice, but I truly believe that if you come up to him hoping for his autograph he is going to reserve a special word for the person with a copy of Special Ops that is full of sticky notes and scribble in the margins.  This author team must have worked very hard to produce something this powerful; drink deep of their knowledge.	2003-04-03
US	34698447	R3OR1NB6I6CM9T	0201440997	639714535	Computer Security: Art and Science	Books	4	44	45	N	N	One of few books that can qualify as a textbook in infosec	Please understand that the Amazon star system, while very powerful has limits, I feel this book is 5 stars as a textbook for an undergrad computer security course, 4 stars for a graduate student and 3 stars for a book on the average information security worker's shelf. <br />Computer Security Art and Science has been years in the making and for good reason; it is over a thousand pages.  The book seems best suited for four groups of readers.  The first group is college students; this will probably be a popular choice as a textbook for undergraduate level students and with additional materials, graduate level students.  It is a complete guide to computer security terminology and theory.  Other groups of readers that would benefit from this book include security knowledgeable managers seeking to assess the knowledge of potential employees especially in policy and architecture positions.  A third group includes anyone preparing for information security certifications.   If you are wish to certify you will benefit from a close reading of this text before attempting your examination.  Finally, anyone seeking to understand the big picture of information security would benefit from Computer Security Art and Science. However the book's value is primarily as a textbook!<br />Like most authors writing a security book, Matt has chosen to start at a basic level beginning with a discussion of confidentiality, integrity and availability.  As a reviewer I was quietly wondering how long he would stay there.  The answer proved to be one chapter only and at the back of the chapter one the author has included insightful, thought provoking study questions.  If I were considering hiring someone who claimed to have experience in information security that could not answer these questions, I would show them the door.<br />Now to consider the rest of the book!   On the first page of chapter two we are introduced to logical equations.  This is where the casual reader is likely to get off thebus while the diligent student with a qualified instructor gets on.   As soon as I saw the equations with no explanation of how to read them, I could see someone browsing in a bookstore shut the cover and move on.  Be brave and press on is my advice; the book is well worth it even if some of the illustrations are beyond comprehension without a teacher's guide.   It says in the preface this book was designed to be a college level textbook.  They have to put a few inscrutable pages in the book so the professors can appear to be smarter than the students.<br />The cryptography section, chapters 9 - 11 are very approachable and while not as in depth as some other sections, they would help anyone preparing for the various industry security certifications including CompTIA's Security +, ISC2's CISSP and SANS' GSEC.  In fact the entire book would be beneficial for any of these.<br />The table of contents says that part 6 of the book, assurance, chapters 18 - 21, were contributed by a different author, Elisabeth Sullivan.  I read those chapters closely and could not detect a different tone or level of quality; the authors are to be congratulated for that.  Nice use of humor on the heading title for 18.1.1, \\"The Need for Assurance\\" and where else can you read about \\"Extreme Programming\\".<br />No book is perfect, the intrusion detection and penetration testing discussions need to be beefed up, but chapter 29, Program Security more than makes up for them.  That chapter should be required reading before anyone is allowed to touch a compiler.<br />I donate most of the books people send me to review to my local library, but this one stays on the shelf and I am setting an iCal reminder to re-read the policy and audit sections a couple months from now.	2003-04-03
US	34698447	R3N8DEFTP80EO6	020163466X	914682675	Firewalls and Internet Security: Repelling the Wily Hacker (2nd Edition)	Books	3	42	46	N	N	A nice internet security overview	My hope was that reading Firewalls and Internet Security - Second Edition would be a chance to sit at the feet of the masters, but I was disappointed.  Part of the problem is the title, this is not a firewall book; this is an internet oriented security overview.  The writing style is professional, but terse, you will learn the names of many important things, but you will not learn how to DO anything and you will not even learn ABOUT very much.  However the book gives you the NAMES of many important topics that you can go research on your own and is valuable for that.  It is well edited and has a flawless layout making it a fast easy read because the technical level is low and the book is short.<br />The book opens with a few pages on security truisms, my favorite part of the book and a dazzling display of intellect!  All the material after the truisms and up to chapter 9 is a quick tour of topics like Security Policy, Host-Based Security and Perimeter Security, Authentication, and all the Protocols in a couple paragraphs each.  <br />Chapters 9 - 12 are where the book covers perimeters.  Chapter 9 is dated material, Static Packet Filters, Network Topology, Application Gateways, and SOCKS.  The book begins to improve in Chapter 10, remember, these authors really know their stuff and if you read closely there is wisdom here.  The \\"Use the phone?\\" comment in the H.323 and SIP example firewall rule was a classic.  Sadly, this whole critically important section got one thin paragraph.<br />In Chapter 13, there is a fascinating discussion about using routing tricks to protect a host, but it isn't clear to me you can implement this with the four sentences of information the authors provide.  As you march on to Chapter 16, they have a few paragraphs on host security, name some types of IDSes and so forth.<BR> <BR>Chapter 16 is from the original edition, An Evening with Berferd is a lovely read especially if you have a Unix background.  Chapter 17, The Taking of Clark, another war story, was also fun.<BR>  <BR>The ending of the book is sad, the technical material concludes with three and a half pages titled: Where do we go from here?  They briefly mention IPv6, but come to no conclusion as to its future.  DNSsec gets two paragraphs, we do not even learn what it is, (a new resource record where the information that is stored can be signed).  <br />In the final paragraph the authors conclude we are going backward not forward, that we cannot achieve the security level Multics had in the 1970s with modern operating systems.  I sincerely hope that is not true; take a look at OpenBSD, one exploitable remote vulnerability in seven years.  Think about the progress RedHat and Microsoft are making.  Take a look at the work The Center for Internet Security is doing, take the Unix or Windows tracks at SANS, but never, ever give up.	2003-03-22

Lance is the \\"been there, done that\\" guy when it comes to honeypots and that really shows this book teaches, but it also entertains. Honeypots: Tracking Hackers grabs your interest from the start with a real life story of an underground hacker with a powerful new hacking tool, attacking hundreds, if not thousands, of systems all over the world.<br />Lance begins with how he got interested in honeypots and goes on to describe the different tools that are available, how they work and how anyone can set up their system to learn how to defend from novel attacks attacks.  From the personal home computer to huge networks, Lance and his team have a solution.<br />He puts attackers in two categories:  those who want to attack as many systems as possible and those who target a specific system of high value. By defining these attackers the audience has a clear understanding of what they are dealing with.<br />Starting with the history and definition of honeypots and honeynets, he takes us through characteristics and the different levels of interaction, how to configure different levels of honeypots, then on to the need to convince management of the value of honeypots and finally the legal issues (USA law) involved.<br />Honeypots are becoming more acceptable as hackers get into more systems and management is mandated to stop the attacks.  They shouldn't be anyone's first line of defense, but for advanced sites, this is an important suite of technologies.<br />Honeypots:  Tracking Hackers is a must read for novices and experienced security officers, alike.  It will keep your attention and make you want to set up your own honeypot!  If the book is not on your bookshelf and if honeypots are not part of your defensive information plans, something is wrong!	2003-02-24

We are becoming an information economy.  A result of this is that our identity is more important than ever and our identities are at risk of being stolen and misused!  Hack Proofing Your Identity covers the fundamentals you need to know about identity theft.  The book is primarily positioned as an awareness tool and is a serious wake up call.  The author, Teri Bidwell clearly makes the point that simple everyday tasks such as writing checks, using credit cards, logging onto the Internet to perform on-line banking or stock trading reveal our private information to the outside world.<br />This book is directed towards real people, the average computer user, and avoids the gargon you might see in a text written for IT workers.  Parents will also find this book intriguing as it teaches cyber security for children.  The Author not only shares ways of protecting yourself and your private information, but also provide an in-depth introduction and summary of each chapter, as well as fast track solutions and frequently asked questions.<br />The book begins with identity theft and outlines what electronic information is truly private and how your personal information can be used against you.  Then it moves on to a discussion about choosing strong passwords, installing and updating antivirus software as well as file encryption.<br />There is a fascinating discussion about how to protect your identity while using E-mail and the Internet.  The book makes it clear that connecting to the Internet connects you to the rest of the world!  <br />Raising children in the cyber and digital age brings a whole new set of challenges.  Parents need to educate children about computerized sexual predators, unethical and illegal uses of computers.  This is not a pleasant topic, but it is crucial.  My own son nearly fell prey to one as a young teenager.  My wife found him in the garage on the phone with an older lady who was trying to set up a rendezvous.They had met in a chat room.  The book shows you how to protect children from becoming victims of crime on the Internet. <br />What happens if you become a victim of identity theft?  How do you protect yourself or regain your identity?  This is covered as well.  The bottom line, this is an approachable book that covers the basic information that you really should think about.  Read it then make sure your spouse, your parents and your kids know this stuff and put it into practice.	2003-01-07
