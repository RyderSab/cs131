In a society where the lines of demarcation grows more distinct, more angry and more divisive in the population of American people living in same country under the same democratic government, this book expounds on the views of the liberal belief system and the conservative belief system.  The author covers every aspect of the America way of life from education, TV, news media, Hollywood, religious beliefs and family life.  The question is and always remains...what is the direction for the course of your life and what type of society will be here for future generations. <br />   A quote from the author sums it up: \\"One of the symptoms of the corruption and collapse of our national culture is the insistence that we examine only the surface of any work of art.  The policially correct, properly liberal notion is that we should never dig deeper-or to evaluate its impact on society at large.  Contemporary  culture is obsessed with superficial skill and slick salesmanship while ignoring the more important issues of soul and substance.\\" <br />   I highly recommend this book for all who are willing to enter in the deliberation of the future of the society in which we live, these United States of America, and to decide that the cause of conversative political, social and religious beliefs truly have merit based on historical evidence.	2005-07-16

Jacob Sinclair, a skilled carpenter furniture maker, has three daughters that he has reared as as widower.  Meredith, married to Benjamin Walker, a successful businessman, and little Samuel live in the top floor of one of their luxurious resort hotels in the Shenandoah Vally where they entertain their guests during the summer tourist season.   <br />Garnet, Dr. Sloan MacAllister, their sons Robbie and Daniel continue to live in the Shenandoah Valley where Sloam's medical practice is thriving.  But Leah, now age 25, has a teaching career in Richmond, VA and is convinced that she will be a spinster school teacher. <br />During the summer the family converge on the Walker's Stillwaters Resort to visit one another.  Leah bumps into Cade Beinger, friend of the family, at the train station.  From here starts a journey that Leah could never have anticipated.  One promised to shake her emotionally, spiritually and intellectually.  With an overturned stage coach, run away horses and unplanned over night wilderness camping stirs the drama that Leah and Cade experience that summer. <br />Then Benjamin's old nemesis appears to cause serious trouble in the community.  Cade's involvement puts his life in jeopardy.  Even Leah's hard countenance is penetrated when Cade is abducted.   She learns to trust and to overcome her fears in order to rescue and  protect her injured beau. <br />While at Stillwaters, Jacob meets the widow, Fiona Carlton.  While she is a mysteriously veiled and private person, Jacob is drawn to her reticense. <br />As with her older sisters, Leah, also has a heartwood chest but she is confounded by the item that Jacob put in the secret comparment.  Her interpretation is totally the opposite of what Jacob intended.  That discovery leads him to the revelation of Leah's heart wretching grief and pain from the loss of her mother at the age of four.  It is also the pain that has kept Leah from giving her heart in full trust and faith to her God and to Cade. <br />Even as Jacob's and Fiona's relationship is developing, Cade's and Leah's disintegrates into a serious misunderstanding. <br />This is a most poignant story of love not only between a man and a woman but the very nature and character of who God is.  Even when strongly devote believers enter a time frustating doubt and confusion, God's nature of love never changes.  He is always there, always. <br />This was one book I had to read the ending a second to absorb the magnitude to the Truth written there.  That fallen man is welcomed into the arms of a loving God even as Cade and Leah were able to open their arms to welcome each back in forgiveness. <br />A truly dyanamic story wrapped around the lives of the Sinclair family and the Shenandoah Valley, Virginia.  What a legacy!	2005-04-13

From goth, punk (Henry's dyed spiked hair, painted face & fingernails wearing a girl's fur jacket) to dead (Yes, there is even a graphic photo of a dead bloody carcass or a donkey.)  Kevin Power, University Alicante, Spain gives a gallery style narrative of Mortensen's pics and paintings but you have to search for which item he is writing about.  He states\\" Viggo Mortensen's photographs are not so much about something...\\"  These pics are about nothing.  Another comment by Power \\"Mortensen again and again focuses and frames his sense of being in the world, the strangeness of it and his strangeness before it.\\"  AND HOW STRANGE IT IT!  It you truly want to see the \\"strangeness\\" of Mortensen's work, this shows it.  My regret, that I even bother to look at all.  It strikes me with an oppressive sadness that this might be considered a work of art.	2005-03-08

US	30191030	R372ZNV2IMUJ84	0974707848	327050216	Miyelo	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Miyelo	This book would be an excellent supplement to a historical study of the American Plains of the 1870's to the 1890's with its accompanying  extensive 4 page biliographical references.  It is a compilation of various writings and documents from various  authors.  The color plates are illusionary, ghostly and indistinct.  I would not consider this book for leisure reading.	2005-03-07

I found it lacking in professionalism of photography, tasteless in \\"poetry\\" and the paintings garish collages. The photos with red lines obliterating half the picture are amateurish.  I showed this to a photographer who looked & was not impressed.  The \\"poetry\\" has no form, cadence, rhyme or rhythm and is vulgar in nature.  Sorry, but this book will not be part of my collectable books.	2005-03-03
