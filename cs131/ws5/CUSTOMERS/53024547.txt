Their work on the use of naturalistic and motivational strategies has proved that communication can be taught most effectively when it's functional and meaningful, not as rote drills. <br />This book includes the first widely-available account of those methods, and would be extremely valuable for that reason alone. Hopefully it will prove to many parents and professionals that '80s Lovaas-style \\"ABA\\" is not the only (let alone the best) option around.<br />There are aspects of the book that I'd argue with, though. As a behaviorist, Koegel is determined to treat autism simply as a cluster of symptoms, and pays very little attention to what it feels like from the inside (despite the many people on the autistic spectrum who've written accounts of their experiences).  She pays no attention to sensory problems, for example. She is horrified at the idea that autistic children might be allowed to isolate themselves on the playground (even if that's what they'd prefer?). And she only rather grudgingly accepts that a child might be permitted to \\"stim\\" in private, even though she mentions that research has shown that many stims don't interfere with learning at all.<br />Her claim that a child or adult who can pass for \\"eccentric normal\\" has \\"no symptoms of autism\\" anymore is something that many high-functioning autistic spectrum adults - like me - would question. <br />This is not to dismiss just how far many autistic spectrum kids can go with the right education and support, as Claire LaZebnik's account of her son Andrew demonstrates. Far from it.<br />But one of the things that touched me most in the book was LaZebnik's gentle acceptance that her son may still stim \\"finger puppets\\" in private, and her eloquent description of how his \\"obsessions\\" have contributed positively to his life. Such autistic spectrum traits may never go away, although many of us learn to hide them in public. But with the right support, they can be as much of a blessing as a curse.	2004-04-21

Division TEACCH have never promoted themselves in the way that some other programs working with children have, and for a long while there haven't been any readily-available books describing their current methods and wealth of accumulated clinical experience. <br />This book begins to fill that gap.<br />Although it often refers to the requirements of the UK's National Curriculum, it should be equally relevant to teachers, parents and professionals in the USA and elsewhere. <br />It gives a detailed (but very readable) account of how the various TEACCH tools such as structure, visual schedules and worksystems can be individualized to help support children and adolescents at all levels of ability.<br />And hopefully along the way it should dispel a few myths - that TEACCH methods are only for &quot;low-functioning&quot; children, that they're incompatible with inclusion, and so on.<br />The book never claims to have &quot;The Answer&quot; for dealing with autism; it simply presents a toolbox of low-key, easy-to-implement strategies which can help support the learning of almost any student on the autistic spectrum.	2004-03-26

No dogma, no \\"one-size-fits-all\\" program - just a lot of playful but powerful techniques to help build a child's communication and social skills in the context of everyday life. <br />Unlike many books on autism, this one is jargon-free and easy for an exhausted parent or teacher to read. It doesn't dumb its ideas down, but presents them clearly and memorably (with charming illustrations). <br />I work with kids with autism, and lend out a lot of books to people looking for more information - time and time again, this is the one I've seen people grab onto as a lifeline.	2004-03-20

Judging by this book, the Lovaas approach has apparently only been minimally altered since \\"The ME Book\\" was published in 1981. The shouting and slapping are gone, forced eye contact drills have been dropped, a reading and writing program and a chapter on PECS have been added, various small modifications have been made, and the language is much more \\"touchy-feely\\" and \\"positive\\" (in contrast to the frankly coercive tone of the \\"ME Book\\") . But the core program is largely the same, from its start with physical manipulating the child to get them to sit down on cue, to proceeding through months of rote drills before venturing anywhere near functional communication (let alone choice or spontaneity).<br />When it comes to its depiction of the scientific evidence, the book is deeply disingenuous; for example, Lovaas is happy to cite evidence from small-group studies when it supports his claims, but ignore it as \\"not scientific\\" whenever it conflicts with his opinions. He continually cites his own 1987 study as supporting his methods, without acknowledging that the variable studied was hours of one-to-one teaching - not teaching methodology. He cites papers he co-wrote with Robert Koegel when they support his opinions, then labels Koegel as an unscientific quack for daring to question the supreme effectiveness of discrete trials, or suggesting that motivation and functional communication might have a pivotal role in learning. <br />His claims that techniques such as the natural language paradigm are \\"not supported by objective data\\" border on outright dishonesty, given the significant number of studies indicating that such techniques may strongly outperform Lovaas-style discrete-trial centred techniques for teaching communication. He goes out of his way to try to discredit TEACCH as useless - then includes a segment on the value of \\"visual schedules\\" (pioneered by TEACCH). He happily accepts the (limited but promising) empirical evidence for the effectiveness of PECS, since it can be incorporated into his program, but willfully ignores equal amounts of empirical evidence for techniques which don't fit so neatly into his ideology, or which contradict it. He ignores what the PECS data itself implies - that children do not in fact have to spend months doing imitation drills, or even be able to sit down on demand, before they can develop functional communication. <br />And, needless to say, he completely ignores the large number of first-person accounts by people with autism which are now widely available (ironic that it's people with autism who are accused of failing to pay attention or respond appropriately to others ...) <br />In some instances, he even seems determined to ignore his own data: for example, he acknowledges that \\"self-stimulatory\\" behaviour is actually functional and likely to recur in a different form if suppressed - then makes one of the earliest drills a \\"Hands Quiet\\" command, with the child's hands forcibly restrained should s/he commit the fearful sin of hand-flapping. He acknowledges that a child may be sitting passively and looking at the teacher while not actually paying attention at all, and that they may find this stressful and unpleasant to begin with - but begins with it anyway. Evidently the ideology of \\"Adult As Boss\\", \\"compliance\\", and \\"acting normally\\" over-rides data and common sense. The point that such drills may contribute to making the teaching situation highly aversive (and be entirely counter-productive in behavioural terms) seems to have escaped him.<br />Parents and professionals should be aware that, although there is strong evidence supporting the benefits of intensive one-to-one teaching, and of techniques from the broader field of applied behavioural analysis, there is little or no evidence to suggest that Lovaas's particular teaching protocol is possessed of any special magic. However, there is significant evidence that it may be markedly less effective than more modern techniques when it comes to developing motivation and functional communication.<br />Discrete trial teaching has its uses, especially when it comes to specific skills which can be learnt in a rote manner (for example, using words to label pictures - as opposed to using words to make requests or initiate interaction), and this is a good enough guide to that. But more broadly, the book seems to prove the axiom that when all someone has is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. <br />In a quarter of a century, the toolkit of methods for educating children with autism has expanded to include far more sophisticated and subtle tools than discrete trials alone. But you wouldn't know it from this book.	2004-02-25

And a lot of this has revolved around the fabled &quot;G-spot&quot;.<br />This book is a clear, informative and friendly antidote to all that. It explains the latest anatomical and physiological research on what the &quot;G-spot&quot; actually is (not a spot inside the vagina at all, but the urethral sponge in front of it), and gives a practical guide to the various tips, techniques and toys for stimulating it. Throughout, the author is careful to emphasize that, while some women love G-spot pressure, others don't get a lot out of it, or actually find it uncomfortable. The focus is on finding out what you personally enjoy, not setting yourself a new performance goal.<br />As someone who loves G-spot stimulation, I got a lot out of this book. But so did a friend of mine, who heaved a great sigh of relief on finding out that she was also perfectly normal for finding that G-spot stimulation just made her feel as if she needed to pee.	2001-10-17

Yes, this is indeed a feminist book (although since a &quot;feminist&quot;, by definition, is simply someone who believes that women are equal human beings too, I'm not quite sure why some people have a problem with that). <br />But to be honest, it's pretty hard to discover how ignorant most women are about this fairly crucial part of our bodies and NOT come to the conclusion that something's wrong with the way our society deals with women's sexuality. I thought I was well-informed, but I learnt important stuff about my body from this book that I'd never known before. <br />If substantial numbers of men grew up not knowing they had a penis ... or not knowing where it was ... or how it worked ... or thinking that it was &quot;dirty&quot; to touch it ... or feeling ashamed of needing their lover to touch it in order for them to come ... I think you'd agree that something was wrong. Well, despite all the progress we've made, that's where far too many women are still at right now. Most sex ed classes still use diagrams that don't feature the clitoris at all, or at best show a tiny squiggle floating somewhere in space, and certainly don't give any information on what it actually *does*.<br />And you don't have to be &quot;man-hating&quot; or believe in some vast conspiracy to feel that this situation doesn't do women any favours - or men either. Personally, I've never heard a straight man say &quot;God, I just wish I could meet a women who is totally ignorant about her body and never has an orgasm! Then I'd have to nag her into sex and she'd just lie there feeling depressed! That'd be so HOT!&quot;.<br />Buy this fun and fascinating book (I particularly love the cartoon illustrations - meticulously detailed and informative, but the opposite of the sterile diagrams so many books feature). And learn all the stuff you should have been taught in sex ed.	2001-10-17

Writing that &quot;the ways they related and interacted were like a malignancy&quot; and that they were &quot;incapable of understanding needs, unable to correctly read them, satisfy them&quot;, he presents them as a caricature of the hen-pecked father and the unloving mother (who he describes at one point as &quot;rattling on, insensitive now as ever, patronizing, belittling&quot;). <br />Despite his disingenous claim not to be blaming anyone, it is all too clear that Cipolloni's own attitudes are as patronizing and rigid as anything he attributes to Sean's parents. His own ability to see Sean truly is skewed by his obliviousness to his own emotional reactions, particularly his &quot;rescue fantasy&quot; in which he is the miracle-worker (&quot;invariably I did reach each child&quot;) able to save Sean from his wicked and uncomprehending parents. <br />He admits at the end of the book &quot;I do not go to see Sean or any of the others, and have not for many years&quot;.	2000-10-11

She suggests searching for birth mothers in areas of high unemployment as this makes it more likely that birthmothers will be unable to afford to raise their babies themselves.<br />She even argues that there's nothing wrong with black market adoption except its illegality, and that birthparents should be free to selll babies for profit to those who want to buy. <br />The &quot;heart&quot; referred to in the title seems to have no trouble treating children as commodities.	2000-10-01

He points out the obvious fact that these children do not  fit the picture of &quot;classical autism&quot; and proceeds on this basis  to paint a picture of scheming schools and &quot;so-called experts&quot;  out to misdiagnose and &quot;label&quot; children as autistic in order to  get extra funds (what funds?). <br />But he seems never to have heard of the  autistic spectrum (almost all of his references to texts on autism date  from the 70s, and Asperger's syndrome and hyperlexia, for example, are  never mentioned), or to be aware that many of the traits he describes  (skill with puzzles, dismantling objects, eidetic memory, advanced reading  intense absorption, and so on) are often also autistic traits. Although he  admits grudgingly at one point that &quot;autistic children are in some  ways more extreme examples of the set of abilities and disabilities found  in our group&quot;, it never occurs to him that the group might benefit  rather than suffer from being considered in relation to the top end of the  autistic spectrum, even if they do not fit any available diagnostic  category neatly.<br />Characteristically, such children remain  &quot;different&quot; and eccentric even when they have begun talking. This  difference can ultimately be as much an intellectual advantage as a  disadvantage (As researchers from Hans Asperger onwards have pointed out),  but to ignore it and pretend that &quot;everything is fine now he's started  talking&quot; is to take a serious risk. It is disturbing to read the  number of parents Sowell quotes who mention in passing that their child  does seem to have some problems with social interaction, but insist that  this is entirelydue to the time they missed owing to delayed speech. Some  such children do succeed and flourish in school and adult life without a  diagnosis or any specialist support and understanding; many do not.<br />I  suppose I have a personal interest here: although I spoke early (if very  bizarrely), I too was considered by some of my teachers to be &quot;like an  autistic child&quot;. But since I spoke, it was assumed that I couldn't be  autistic, and all my oddities and problems were attributed to my laziness,  rudeness, stubbornness and &quot;just not trying&quot;. It wasn't until I  was 20 (by which time I was clinically depressed after years of trying very  hard and failing very hard to be like everyone else) that I was finally  diagnosed as having Asperger's syndrome, another condition on the autistic  spectrum. Finally being able to understand how I function has been a huge  relief, and has enabled me to make full use of my particular, quirky  strengths.<br />If this book raises awareness that many children with highly  idiosyncratic developmental patterns can become successful and flourishing  adults, it will have done a great service; if it causes parents to reject  any diagnosis or specialist understanding as a &quot;label&quot; and avoid  speech therapy and other resources that may help, it will have done them  and their children a great disservice.	2000-05-14

Brody's detailed accounts of therapy with children with different needs make fascinating reading, as do  her thoughts on issues of limit-setting and respect (her criticisms of  forced &quot;holding therapies&quot; are cogent and sensitive).<br />But there  are also some strange gaps and errors in the book - for example, the claim  that &quot;the root cause of autism in the child is the lack of bonding  with the parents&quot;. Given that the wholly neurological nature of autism  has been accepted by researchers for the last thirty years, this is  shocking ignorance. It also prevents what might have been an interesting  consideration of the role of developmental, relationship oriented therapy  with children with organic disabilities, or how to use touch with children  who may have neurological hyper- or hypo-sensitivities to it.<br />Brody often  seems to see touch as the only important element of therapy. While this  extremism might be seen as justified in order to balance the neglect of  touch as a topic, it means that there's no consideration of how to  integrate her approach with other therapeutic or educational elements.	2000-04-14

I found her account of separation issues to be much less sensitive  and thoughtful than that of Claudia Jewett (&quot;Helping Children Cope  with Separation and Loss&quot;), for example. <br />There is almost no  reference to organic mental or physical disabilities, except for outdated  references to &quot;schizophrenic children&quot; dating from the  1960s.<br />There is useful advice in it, but it doesn't extend far beyond  common sense and is undermined by inaccuracies and omissions.	2000-04-09

One can only assume that this book  was written in very bad faith.	1999-12-21

Yet there are many aspects of it which are worrying in ways which I'm sure the author did not intend. <br />The book seems to be intended as a plea for better services and more respect for families adopting children with special needs, yet in many respects it is more effective, possibly unintentionally, in highlighting the self-generated problems faced by adoptive parents with unrealistic expectations (she collapses in despair when she realizes of Jared &quot;I couldn't fix him&quot; and decides that this means &quot;his would be a wasted life&quot;) and mixed feelings even before adoption. <br /><br />In contrast to her clear affection for Jacob, her relationship to the younger boy, Jared, is particularly worrying. She states that she didn't want to adopt him and didn't feel she could meet the needs of both boys, but did so because she felt that the two boys should be together. She may love Jared, but she certainly doesn't seem to like him, and describes in detail the resentment and despair he provokes in her (one day, she writes &quot;I actually found myself thinking that if he was ran over by a car and killed, the world would be the better for it&quot;). She concludes at one point, &quot;There would never be any joy in parenting Jared - only hard work, disappointment, shame, and sorrow,&quot; and gives no indications that she has revised this opinion by the end of the book.  Her treatment of Jared at one point appalls an old friend so much that she never visits again.<br /><br />She rejects Jared's diagnosis with high-functioning autism/Asperger's syndrome on the grounds that &quot;I knew enough about autism to think there was a mistake&quot;, although she doesn't know enough to know that this diagnosis doesn't contradict their earlier diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder as she claims - in fact, it confirms it, as Asperger's syndrome is one of the group or spectrum of conditions referred to collectively as pervasive developmental disorders. She states that Jared is socially isolated and inept owing to his inability to understand social rules, a perfectionist with huge problems transitioning from one activity to another, obsessed with tying things up, restricted in his play, incredibly literal in his understanding of words, clumsy, one-sided in his interactions, and often &quot;in a world of his own&quot;; he rocks, bangs his head when little, runs in circles, has a compulsive need for sameness, and serious sensory hypersensitivities, including an auditory processing problem - all classic symptoms of a pervasive developmental disorder. Perhaps the diagnosis was indeed incorrect, but Shilts never gives any reasons why she thinks so. Instead, she sees Jared's inability to understand or take into account other people's feelings as proof that he is &quot;greedy and selfish&quot;, a &quot;willful and malicious child&quot;.<br /><br />She is puzzled as to why her endless &quot;processing&quot; of his misbehaviour with him fails to work (he's diagnosed as having a language disorder and has huge problems connecting cause and effect), while mentioning that this processing alternates as a response with increasingly severe spankings.<br /><br />She claims that finally learning about sensory defensiveness changed everything for the better, and yet the two boys were diagnosed with sensory integrative problems early on: the smallest amout of reading about sensory integration problems should surely have mentioned sensory hypersensitivity and defensiveness. She explains that sensory integration dysfunction causes tactile defensiveness (which makes touch overwhelming and intolerable), but then enthusiastically describes her use of &quot;holding therapy&quot;, which involves forced holding of a child until they submit (and is consideredabusive by many experts).<br /><br />Special needs adoption undeniably poses great challenges.  Parenting one child with severe special needs can put an often unendurable strain on any parent; the stress of trying to parent two must be incredible, and no parent is perfect. But if Jacob and Jared are very difficult children, Donna Shilts in many respects seems to be an equally difficult parent. She sets out idealistically to &quot;rescue&quot; the two children, but eventually her actions seem to verge on the abusive, including actually biting Jared (aged 9) as a punishment for biting other children. Parenting children with special needs is very tough, but ultimately, they are the children and she is the adult. It takes great courage to admit to disliking and resenting a child, let alone biting them; but the reader cannot then be asked to admire the person who makes such an admission as a &quot;model parent&quot; or pity them as a martyr.	1999-12-13

It's certainly vital to  raise people's awareness that adoption is never problem-free, and that it's  impossible (as well as unethical) to try to cut a child off from their  past, but to do so through a glorification of some primal pre-natal  &quot;bonding&quot; is unhelpful to say the least.

She was clearly not informed by the social workers  and agency about the level of problems that older children may face, or  about the history of the two she adopted - yet at the same time she doesn't  seem to have made any attempts to inform herself either or even to have  anticipated the possibility of serious problems. <br />She indicates that both  she and the rest of her biological family had &quot;given up on&quot; and  were desperately unhappy with the two adoptive children even before the  adoption was finalized, but she doesn't seem to have considered that  backing out might have been fairer to everyone concerned. She doesn't  speculate, either, on how the fact that the family were clearly unhappy  with the two adoptees may have affected them - she only mentions in passing  that her biological children later confessed to having resented and teased  them.<br />She concludes that perhaps some children are too damaged to be  placed in family homes; perhaps it would be harder to accept that her  family just wasn't the right one to cope with these two kids.	1999-08-31

She painstakingly documents the way in which unrealistic expectations  and demands lead to a situation in which almost continual prompting,  directing, &quot;cheating&quot; on behalf of children, and even  straightfoward physical manipulation are used to get children to &quot;go  through the motions&quot; of a &quot;normal&quot; schedule, regardless of  their incomprehension or lack of interest in it.

Lovaas's own research has shown that this is a very ineffective  way of teaching communication: it may succeed in producing a child who can  respond &quot;ball&quot; to the question &quot;what's this&quot;, but it  doesn't result in a child who is able to say &quot;ball&quot; in order to  request a ball (that would have to be taught separately, and there's no way  of &quot;drilling&quot; for spontaneous communication, so Lovaas fails to  describe in any detail how this leap is to be achieved).<br />In the Koegels'  approach, the teacher might initiate a game with the ball, and then when  the child reaches for it, prompt them to say &quot;ball&quot;, rewarding  them by giving them the ball. Unsurprisingly, this is far more effective as  a way of teaching functional communication (as well as eliminating the  distress and frustration which is commonly experienced by children in  Lovaas-type programs - there is at least one documented case of an autistic  child who developed post-traumatic stress disorder after a Lovaas-style  program).<br />Speech and language researchers have shown that echolalia,  which Lovaas believes must be suppressed, actually functions as a  stepping-stone to communicative speech for many autistic children. Other  researchers, such as V. Mark Durand, have shown that modern techniques  which do not use aversives, but which focus on working out what the person  in question is using challenging behaviour to communicate, can be far more  effective than ones which rely on punishment.<br />Parents should not be  fooled into thinking that Lovaas is state-of-the-art, or that there is any  special curative &quot;magic&quot; about this outdated textbook.way  of &quot;drilling&quot; for spontaneous communication, so Lovaas fails to  describe in any detail how this leap is to be achieved).<br />In the Koegels'  approach, the teacher might initiate a game with the ball, and then when  the child reaches for it, prompt them to say &quot;ball&quot;, rewarding  them by giving them the ball.

Because of his  linguistic view of autism, Martin sees it as a disorder in which a normal  mind is &quot;trapped&quot; within an autistic body, and so it is  unsurprising that FC would appeal to him, and that he would refuse to  accept the numerous studies which have unequivocally shown that the  messages are coming unconsciously from the facililitator. Nonetheless, his  presentation of the debate is shoddy. He simply accuses critics of FC of  thinking that people with autism are &quot;idiots&quot;, an accusation  which is cruel and ironic given that those who accept the evidence against  FC include a number of high-functioning autistic people such as Temple  Grandin.<br />He ignores the key question about FC: how much damage can be  done to the lives of autistic children and adults if absolute trust is  placed in &quot;messages&quot; which may not be coming from them at all? He  describes, apparently without qualms, the parents of his autistic nephew  Ian physically holding him at the keyboard despite his struggles,  force-feeding him, and forcibly taking a struggling Ian to school despite  his verbal cries of &quot;stay home! sick!&quot; - all because the  facilitated &quot;messages&quot; say that this is what he really wants.  Ian's favourite activities, like flapping book pages, are characterized as  nothing more than involuntary body movements that get in the way of the  &quot;real&quot; Ian.<br />In his pursuit of the normal child supposedly  trapped within, Martin and others seem to be in danger of writing off the  autistic child as a mere &quot;shell&quot;, to be disregarded and  overpowered where possible.	1999-08-16

Contributors include not only therapists and other professionals, but also  adoptive parents and kids with attachment-trauma problems  themselves.<br />Unlike many other authors on this controversial topic,  Beverley James, an expert on treating trauma in children, doesn't claim  that there are any easy answers or any short-cuts to building relationships  and trust. Although she demonstrates her awareness of how huge and  exhausting the problems of such children can be, she doesn't scare-monger -  she makes it clear that children with attachment-trauma problems are deeply  damaged children, not budding serial killers. <br />It's all too easy for  parents faced with incredibly challenging, frustrating and baffling  children to opt in despair for violent and entirely unproven treatments  like &quot;holding therapy&quot; which claim to effect a &quot;miracle  cure&quot; by forcing the child into physical submission. James provides  cogent arguments that these only abuse and traumatize the child further,  echoing the distorted bonds which often form between a kinapper and victim  - or a child and an abusive parent. Instead, she and her fellow  contributors offer real alternatives.<br />This book will be indispensible for  professionals, but it will also be an invaluable source of comfort and  support for parents. James and her contributors don't offer any &quot;quick  fixes&quot; - but they do provide solid, detailed advice, tangible caring,  and a real sense of hope. Some of the most moving stories in the book come  from people who have grown from deeply deprived and disturbed children into  flourishing adults.	1999-04-28

If nothing else, it gives a very strong sense of how exhausting coping with an  autistic child can be.<br />Yet there were also aspects of the book that I  found saddening, even worrying. Wendy Robinson states at many points her  faith that there was a normal child somehow &quot;trapped&quot; inside her  autistic son, that the autistic boy was just a shell, not the real Grant.  In some ways, her quest for a &quot;miracle cure&quot; seems to involve a  rejection of the autistic son she describes so well and so affectionately.  She praises a number of treatments, such as facilitated communication and  holding therapy, which have been claimed to liberate the normal child  supposedly trapped inside the autism, without mentioning that both of these  have not only been scientifically discredited but also criticized as  potentially extremely damaging to the autistic child and their  family.<br />Many high-functioning people with autism such as Temple Grandin  have made it clear that there is no normal person inside, and written  movingly about their need to be accepted as they are. However difficult and  sometimes frustrating living with an autistic person can be, rejecting them  in favour of an imaginary normal child inside them is no solution.	1999-04-28

It is now agreed by all autism researchers that autism is biological in origin, and has nothing to  do with the parents' behaviour at all - cold and rejecting or abusive  parents produce emotionally disturbed kids, not autistic ones, as  Bettelheim claimed. Exhaustive studies have shown that the parents of  autistic children are not distinguishable on any psychological measure from  the parents of normal children. There is in fact general agreement that  there is a substantial genetic factor - cases of identical twins where only  one has autism (in fact very rare) simply show that the genetic factor is  not 100% and there is also a role for factors such as viral damage, brain  damage at birth, etc. Leo Kanner, who first identified autism as a  syndrome, liked to refer to Bettelheim's book as \\"The Empty  Book\\".  (...) I  highly recommend Richard Pollak's brilliant expose \\"The Creation of  Dr. B.\\"  Many high-functioning autistic people such as Temple Grandin  and Donna Williams have also spoken out against psychoanalytic  \\"interpretations\\" as having absolutely nothing to do with their  experience (indeed many people with high-functioning autism and Asperger's  syndrome can be reduced to helpless laughter or tears of fury by reading  \\"The Empty Fortress\\".  Ultimately, the fact that \\"The Empty  Fortress\\" still has its defenders among psychoanalysts is a damning  statement about the psychoanalytic profession and its inability to admit  mistakes (hmm, I wonder what that says about their unconscious  motivations?).	1999-03-28

Catherine Maurice's devastating criticisms of the fraudulent therapies which attempt to make mothers feel guilty for their children's autism would alone make the book  worth reading.<br />However, I have three very major concerns about the book.  <br />The first is that Maurice presents Lovaas's version of ABA as the only possible  option, ignoring the fact that there are other educational methods (such as  TEACCH, Greenspan, or the various other techniques within the behavioural field such as the Koegels' modifications of ABA), which also have solid scientific evidence backing them. <br />Secondly, she also ignores the experts  who have raised doubts about Lovaas's claim to have effected complete  \\"recoveries\\" from autism, and who have pointed out that greatly  improving a child's level of functioning, while vitally important, is not  the same as a \\"cure\\". I've seen too many parents who read  Maurice's book and immediately start to plan on the basis that after a few  years of Lovaas treatment, their child will be completely normal. The  overwhelming balance of evidence is that as a rule autistic children grow  up to be autistic adults. We (I have high-functioning autism) may grow up  to be independent, happy and successful adults, such as Dr. Temple Grandin,  but we remain \\"different\\", and often experience great stress from  the constant pressure placed on us by families and society to be more  \\"normal\\".<br />Thirdly, I was worried by the way in which she  constantly treats autism as a tragedy and a fate worse than death, and  speaks of dragging her children kicking and screaming out of autism,  forcing them to be \\"normal\\". Autism certainly doesn't make life  easy (and I work with kids with severe autism  combined with severe mental retardation, so I know just how difficult it  can be), but nonetheless it's also part of who I am, not a  \\"shell\\" in which there is a normal person hidden away. How would  you feel if you found out that your parents viewed who you are as a tragedy  to be cured at all costs?<br />ABA can be a very useful way of teaching, but  I'm worried about people who use it not to teach children but to try to  \\"force\\" them to be normal. There's a big difference between  trying to help someone learn and function better and trying to  \\"fix\\" them by turning them into someone else completely.<br />I'd  recommend that people who read this should not make it their only book on  autism - they should also read a more general account of autism giving  information on the condition itself and on various methods of educating  autistic children, and also a first-person account such as those written by  Dr. Grandin.	1999-03-27

In addition to its highly dubious history (first marketed as a &quot;miracle cure&quot; for the neurological disorder autism, now being sold as a &quot;miracle cure&quot; for attachment disorder), potential  readers should be aware that there is no evidence that &quot;holding  therapy&quot; is either safe or effective, while it has been condemned by  many experts such as Beverly James (editor of the &quot;Handbook for  Treatment of Attachment-Trauma Problems in Children&quot;) as abusive and  liable to traumatize the child further. <br />It is claimed by its proponents  that &quot;holding therapy&quot; is a deeply loving experience for both  parent and child. Welch also cheerfully mentions that children will  physically struggle, promise to be good if the parent stops, beg to be  released, spit, scream, swear, bit, and weep. Many of the now-adult people  who experienced &quot;holding therapy&quot; as children have said that they  still view it as abusive. Who do you believe - the parent and the  therapist, or the child? <br />Indeed, the level of physical violence involved  may be extreme: one parent, Donald Lee Tibbets was convicted of  third-degree felony child-abuse homicide after he killed his 3-year-old  adoptive daughter by using his entire body-weight to hold her down during  &quot;holding therapy&quot;. The state medical examiner found that the  child died of suffocation, with evidence of &quot;blunt-force&quot;  bruising to her abdomen. Tibbets said he used holding therapy &quot;as I  had been taught therapy at the Family and Attachment Center.&quot;<br />In  another case, a small child was removed from his adoptive mother after the  results of &quot;holding therapy&quot; - marks and bruises on his arms and  body - caused the staff at his kindergarten to worry that he was being  abused.<br />A child identified as S.M.A. was removed from the custody of her  the custody of her father and stepmother, the Abbotts, after the court  ruled that &quot;although holding therapy may be accepted by some medical  professionals, the Abbotts' implementation of holding therapy became  abusive and endangered S.M.A.'s physical and emotional health and impaired  her emotional development.&quot; <br />Obviously, the cases which get to the  courts aren't typical; but I wonder about the vast amounts of emotional and  psychological damage which are wreaked in the cases which don't get to the  courts. It frightens me that this book is sold without parents being  informed of the potential damage it can do.	1999-03-26

Yet another book deriding the new biologically-oriented psychiatry as dry and heartless. <br />Contains several case histories of classically autistic children who are deemed to be deeply emotionally disturbed (the fault of  their parents, of course) and subjected to ludicrous psychoanalytic  interpretations. Where has Roemmelt been since the sixties? Has he not yet  noticed not only that autism has been conclusively demonstrated to be  neurological in origin, but that a number of high-functioning people with  autism (such as Temple Grandin and Gunilla Gerland) have backed this up and  started describing their experiences, which, needless to say, bear no  resemblance to Roemmelt's wild imaginings? <br />Any attempt to present  psychoanalysis as the warm, humane, &quot;touchy-feely&quot; alternative to  biologically-oriented psychiatry is doomed if it displays this much  ignorance and lack of interest in the actual minds and opinions of the  people it purports to be studying. <br />One reason, after all, for the surge  in biologically-oriented psychiatry in the last decade is the massive  number of lives that were shattered by psychoanalytic dogmas (such as the  groundless claim that autism was an emotional disturbance caused by  unloving parents).	1999-02-27

It's unclear whether she believes that his mother caused all his  problems or was merely exacerbating them (one can only hope the latter for  the author's sake, given that autism and childhood schizophrenia are both  known to be wholly neurological, but the title seems to imply the former).  <br />The book only reveals in very very small print that it's &quot;a  composite of a number of cases of the problems faced  by the social service  and medical profession in the diagnosis, treatment, and development of  capabilities of such children&quot; (i.e. this didn't actually take place).	1999-02-03

Sorry, Barry,  that's not real acceptance. If you truly accept someone as they are, you  stop looking for &quot;miracles&quot; that'll make them into someone else.  <br />He claims he can't guarantee any results, but when ever Robertito fails  to progress dramatically, it is always his parents' attitudes which are  deemed to be at fault. They aren't accepting enough, or they're expecting  too much (evidently, you can only expect miracles if you stop expecting  miracles). Presumably, if they just got their attitudes right, he'd be  cured.<br />He talks equally constantly about how non-judgmental he is, but in  fact judges others in the most sneakily vicious way imaginable. Anyone who  uses other methods to teach autistic children, or who asks him difficult  questions, is portrayed as a cold and brutal torturer. The mother who  criticises him for making other parents feel that they're to blame if they  don't produce &quot;miracles&quot; is held to be short-sighted and  incapable of understanding. We even know that one character is going to  turn out to be a baddie when she refuses to stop drinking coffee and start  a health-food diet - sure enough, she's quickly shown to be callous and  irresponsible. <br />Indeed, judging by Kaufman's description of his own  family, anything less than a continual state of blissed-out happiness about  everything is unacceptable (consequently, there's a certain &quot;Stepford  Wives&quot; feel to a lot of the book).<br />The whole book has a strangely  novelistic feel,with detailed accounts of conversations Kaufman wasn't  present at and lengthy accounts of others' private thoughts. Unless we are  to assume that he's psychic, we have to infer that at least part of the  book is &quot;imaginative reconstruction&quot;. I have no objection to this  sort of thing per se, but it's thoroughly out of place in what is supposed  to be a documentary account.<br />I'm not just a random cynic, I am a  high-functioning person with autism. I've spent my life with people trying  to &quot;fix&quot; me in one way or another. And I can safely say that  being locked in a small playroom with a Kaufman determined to &quot;accept  me in a totally loving and non-judgemental manner&quot; is my personal idea  of hell.	1999-01-04

I can't really do more than echo the praises of other reviewers, but I wanted to add that this excellent book will be also be indispensible for many parents of children with autism, Asperger's syndrome or PDD-NOS.                    Most of the examples in the book focus on kids with ADHD or  Tourette's, and the book only mentions PDD very briefly, but its wise  advice would be equally relevant to verbal kids with autistic spectrum  conditions who have rage attacks/tantrums, as many do. <br />I'm speaking from  personal experience here - I have Asperger's syndrome (a mild autistic  spectrum condition), and, looking back, as a child I definitely fitted the  &quot;inflexible-explosive&quot; patterns described in the book. This book  encapsulates all the wisdom my exhausted parents had to learn the hard  way.<br />I already know of at least one parent of a teenager with AS who is  currently finding the book absolutely lifesaving, and I've had to buy  several copies to lend to people.<br />It's thoughtful, humane, and very  practical.

Practical, honest and realistic, this book recognizes that before they can do anything else, parents have got to prevent their autistic child from running into the middle of the road or flushing all the household's soap  down the toilet.<br />It's designed to be easy to read, with accounts of  common (and uncommon) problems organized into sections (e.g. on agression,  eating, or hygiene), so that it's possible for an exhausted parent to look  up a specific problem without reading the whole book from start to finish.  Each sections features accounts by parents of how they found a solution to  a particular problem. Although the book is grounded in the wise and humane  approach evolved by Dr Schopler and his colleagues over decades of research  and practice, the emphasis throughout is on finding what works for a  particular child or adult with autism, not imposing a rigid theory.<br />Any  parent of a child with an autistic spectrum condition (not to mention  teachers and other professionals) will find something that they recognize  here, and get advice from the true experts - other parents in the same  boat.	1998-12-28

It's true to say that Veblen's book is one of the great classics of economic theory; however, such a description suggests (at least to non-economists like myself) that the book will be either dull or remorselessly technical. On the contrary, &quot;The Theory of the Leisure  Class&quot; is stylishly written, endlessly startling (for example, Veblen  analyses religion as an outgrowth of the gambling instinct), and very, very  funny. Its expose of &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot; (yes, Veblen was  the one who invented this famous concept) is as relevant today as it was in  1899, if not more so.

However, his attitude is summed up movingly in his  choice of epigraph for the book: Cromwell's plea to &quot;think it possible  you may be mistaken.&quot; On this, he builds a devastating case:  psychoanalysts, having made up their minds (because it fitted their  theories) that such conditions must be the result of deep psychological  disturbances, refused to even consider that it was possible they might be  mistaken, even in the face of mounting contradictory evidence and agonizing  misery on the part of patients and families (although Dolnick doesn't  mention it, at least one mother is known to have commited suicide after  psychoanalysts convinced her that she had personally caused her son's  autism through her unconscious hatred and coldness). Psychoanalysts, of  course, are not the only ones to blame; Dolnick also notes how  unquestioningly their theories were adopted and spread by the media.<br />In  the end, though, what seems more damning than anything else is the fact  that no psychoanalyst has ever apologized or admitted that they were in  error. Predictably enough, Bruno Bettelheim, who compared parents of  autistic children to concentration camp guards, died in old age still  convinced he was right, and praised by other analysts as a genius and  saint.	1998-12-03

As a method for treating disturbed and disabled children, Jernberg advocates physically restraining them and ordering them around (she even specifies that therapists should be careful  not to allow any child-initiated activities) all the with apparent aim of  breaking the child's will. To quote one of the book's case  histories:<br />'Session 11  ... Told both of us to let him go. Told us we  were holding him too tight, choking him, and so on. We finally restrained  him, but with less difficulty this time than last. ... Session 19 .. Said  &quot;I have to do what adults say.&quot;'<br />In another case, held up as an  example of good practice, she mentions in passing that the child starts  screaming uncontrollably as soon as he sees the therapist, and doesn't stop  for the rest of the session. But it's all for his own good, and not at all  cruel, and huge fun for him really (we know this because Jernberg tells us  so, although she doesn't tell us quite how she is so sure).<br />Just for good  measure, she quotes approvingly and often from John Rosen and blames autism on faulty mother-child  bonding (not that one again...)<br />Only worth reading if you like horror  stories.	1998-12-03

Doman is presented as the only person who really respects parents  and is willing to talk honestly to them and teach them how to  &quot;cure&quot; their children, unlike other professionals who are cold,  arrogant, and uncaring (agreeing with the accuracy of the latter  description, alas, does not guarantee the truth of the former). He uses a  &quot;folksy&quot; style, in which dubious conclusions are presented as  homely truths, and in which a long-discredited theory of human development  (that children &quot;need&quot; to go through the stages of crawling,  creeping and walking in a particular way for normal neurological  development to take place) is presented as state-of-the-art science.<br />  If you are considering Doman's therapies, at least read &quot;No Time For  Jello&quot; by Berneen Bratt as well - this first-hand account of her  intial passionate faith in and painful disillusionment with  &quot;patterning&quot; for her disabled son, plus an excellent summary of  the scientific research on patterning to date, might at least cause some  people to think twice.	1998-10-19

An effective counter-balance to the tendency of accounts of  &quot;miracle&quot; alternative treatments to describe only the isolated  &quot;miracle cures&quot; results and ignore with the far more common  &quot;failures&quot;, it also includes an appended summary of the  scientific research on Doman's therapies which quietly and devastatingly  demolishes the claims made for them.<br />I totally agree with the previous  reviewer that this book should be compulsory reading for anyone even  considering Doman's therapies, but it should also be relevant and  interesting to a wider audience. Bratt examines the complex psychological  issues involved in the pursuit of a 'cure&quot; for a child with special  needs - how parents are made to feel (and make themselves feel) that they  are positively immoral unless they are willing to try anything that holds  out even the faintest hope of a cure (at whatever cost), the costs of an  exhausting and coercive treatment plan on the family as a whole, the  psychological effect on a child of a treatment which implies so clearly  that he's not OK as he is and needs to be &quot;fixed&quot;, and the  emotional consequences for both child and parents when such a cure fails to  materialize and they finally have to accept the child's disability as a  permanent part of his life. At the end of the book, her description of her  acceptance of Jamie as he is, disability and all, is deeply moving. <br />Of  course, a quiet and intelligent book like this will never win even a tenth  of the readership of the sensational and mendacious books that sell the  promise of miracles. All people who really care about children with special  needs should regret this.	1998-10-10

While acknowledging the huge benefits that inclusion holds for some  students, the authors put forward the case that for other students, it may  have equally huge disadvantages, both educational and social, and that by  jumping on the bandwagon of &quot;full inclusion&quot;, educationalists are  actually seriously failing some students with disabilities. <br />Instead, the  book argues, a range of educational possibilites are needed, so that each  student's individual needs can be met most fully, with the goal being  inclusion in society as a full and equal participant (which includes the  right to be different). The essays include both those attacking the  theoretical arguments involved and those which examine the issue with  respect to specific disabilities such as autism, learning disabilities and  deafness. <br />As a disabled person whose life was very nearly ruined by my  experiences in the &quot;mainstream&quot;, I hope that this book may cause  some educationalists to think twice before sacrificing the rights of  students with disabilities to the cause of &quot;educational  correctness&quot;.	1998-10-06

Life is as nasty, brutal and short as  it presumably was in the real 15th-century, and the protagonists are  complicated, messed-up, and thoroughly believable human beings (the book  even includes that rarity, a female leading character who isn't terminally  bland), despite or because of which the book is hugely enjoyable and great  fun.<br />Definitely not for those looking for another slice of pseudo-Tolkien  questing, but highly recommended for anyone interested in something a  little more challenging.

This  &quot;therapy&quot;, also known as &quot;holding therapy&quot; entails one  or more adults pinning a child to the ground and provoking them (verbally  or using physical prodding or poking) until they are screaming with rage or  fear. Supposedly, this allows the child to release all their past traumas  and magically and instantaneously bond to their parents (bonding evidently  being a form of psychological super-glue which can be poured on in a matter  of days or weeks without the necessity of building a relationship). <br />If  this didn't have a pseudo-therapeutic rationale behind it (the authors even  mention proudly that it was devised for treating autistic children, having  failed to notice that autism has been conclusively shown to be neurological  in origin), we'd call it child abuse. <br />In fact, it has been heavily  criticized by many experts, including authorities on working with  traumatized and attachment-disordered children such as Beverly James  (editor of the &quot;Handbook for Treatment of Attachment-Trauma Problems  in Children&quot;), who argue that it only traumatizes and abuses the child  further. <br />Parents shouldn't be pressured into inflicting controversial  and harmful treatments on their children by claims such as those in this  book that unless they do their children will become sociopathic criminals.  The behavioral and emotional problems of abused and traumatized children  are very real, and very dificult for both adoptive parents and society in  general to cope with.

When Kaufman describes them in any detail, the developmental play techniques he uses with his son seem intelligent and useful, and the emphasis on responsiveness and attention to what motivates the child in question is good. It's also nice to read someone who is not continually worried about how to eliminate entirely harmless but &quot;inappropriate&quot; autistic behavior. Various other writers - Stanley Greenspan, Melanie Nind and Dave Hewett, etc. - have actually developed similar techniques, but have described them in much greater detail and scientifically documented their (more modest) claims, something Kaufman has consistently failed to do.<br />Too often, however, Kaufman seems to reject practical details in favour of claiming that the right attitude is all that matters, the right attitude apparently requiring &quot;choosing&quot; to feel happy about everything. Any parent of a child with autism who occasionally feels tired, frustrated, or momentarily unable to &quot;choose&quot; to be ecstatic will now have to feel inadequate as well. As a person with an autistic spectrum condition (Asperger's syndrome) myself, and as a volunteer with severely autistic children, I happen to think that autism and autistic people are beautiful and wonderful beyond measure, but I don't think that such enjoyment and delight should be made compulsory (a sure way to destroy them anyway) or that parents should have to feel that they are failing their child if they also feel the other, equally human and valid emotions of fatigue, worry, or grief...he seems to be selling acceptance on the basis that if you just accept something enough, then a &quot;miracle&quot; will occur and it will go away (which is an odd sort of acceptance). If a mirac! le doesn't occur, then presumably you had the wrong attitude... For many children, I'm sure that the practical techniques he describes are genuinely beneficial (Craig Schulze, in &quot;When Snow Turnsto Rain&quot;, describes how they were not for his son), but I have an innate distrust of anyone who sells (literally or figuratively) a fixed package of techniques as a &quot;miracle cure&quot; for all children and all problems.

This flaw seemed to cast doubt on the rest of the book, as Miller would seem to be contradicting her own principles by ignoring the testimony of high-functioning people with autism themselves who have spoken out vociferously against this view and by treating the traumatic and pointless method of &quot;holding therapy&quot; as a miracle cure. <br />Society badly needs to wake up to the issue of child abuse (emotional as well as physical), but this cause is hindered not helped by claiming as a product of abuse one of the disorders which has been most conclusively shown to be neurological.	1998-06-27

In contrast to some other popular accounts of autism, the book tells the story of a child for whom no treatment produces a &quot;miracle cure&quot; or &quot;amazing recovery&quot; (in other words, a child typical of the overwhelming majority of those with autism). Some treatments or methods of education seem to help; others are ineffective; none produce a &quot;cure&quot;. At the book's end, life goes on, though radically altered. <br />A further account of Jordan's life features in &quot;When Autism Strikes: Families Cope with Childhood Disintegrative Disorder&quot; edited by Robert A.

Two of his films, &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; and &quot;La Regle du Jeu&quot;, regularly feature on critics' lists of the greatest films ever created. Even now, over 60 years after some of his films were made, they still seem fresher and more modern (as well as more entertaining) than most of the films produced today.<br />This warm and witty book presents Renoir's own view of his life and career. It is not only filled with engaging insights into Renoir's own films and his views on cinema in general, but also amply stocked with vivid anecdotes, from visiting Berlin at the time of Hitler's rise to power to watching Jean Gabin and Marlene Dietrich quarrel in Hollywood.<br />For those who already know and love Renoir's films, this will be essential reading; for those who have not yet discovered them, this book should make them realize what they have been missing out on.	1998-05-08

Unfortunately, Szasz has built a career on denying that mental illness exists, so I must assume that he actually believes this. He expounds a largely fictitious &quot;history&quot; of psychiatry (he seriously seems to believe that Freud and the psycho-analysts invented mental illness, ignoring the fact that all known cultures, back to the Ancient Greeks, have had a concept of mental illness) in order to claim that mental illness is just a myth invented by wicked psychiatrists.<br /> The more astute may wonder what Szasz makes of those inconvenient people who report hallucinations, delusions, agonizing depression, etc., etc. Being a deeply compassionate and humanitarian person, Szasz simply accuses them of malingering (yes, he actually says this). He appears to think that people with schizophrenia, depression, bi-polar disorder, and so forth should just &quot;pull themselves together&quot;. I found myself wondering if Szasz had ever actually met, let alone listened to, anyone with a mental illness.<br />Yes, psychiatry, like other forms of medicine, often needs criticism, and has a history of abuse of power behind it. But no-one believes that the solution to abuse of power in other forms of medicine is to declare that bodily illnesses are a &quot;myth&quot; invented by doctors, and that those who complain of broken legs are malingerers. I can only assume that Szasz's fame is due to a stunning amount of popular ignorance and misinformation about mental illness. Having experienced a mental illness (clinical depression) myself, I have to say that Szasz's book adds insult to injury.	1998-02-08

In fact, he is a right-wing libertarian, and his views on mental illness follow logically from his political views. This book leads one to wonder if Szasz has ever actually met anyone with a mental illness.<br />Starting from the premise that there is no such thing as mental illness, he is led to the delightful claim that people with &quot;so-called mental illnesses&quot; are just deliberately acting crazy (it is not clear why anyone would want to do this, especially in the light of the emphasis Szasz lays on the horrors of forced treatment, etc.) and should just be forced to &quot;pull their socks up&quot;. He opposes the defence of not guilty by reason of insanity and the provision of state support for those unable to work because of their &quot;so-called mental illness&quot;. He demonstrates the level of his compassion for people with schizophrenia in such quotes as &quot;Of course, schizophrenia may be said to be like a journey or like a disease; but it is also like many other conditions or situations, like being childish, aimless, useless, and homeless, or being angry, obstreperous, conceited, and selfish.&quot; He accuses those more sympathetic to people with schizophrenia of &quot;allowing incompetent, destructive and self-destructive persons to wallow in their self-contempt and contempt of others...&quot;.<br />It is interesting to contrast this with the lyrical and intensely compassionate writings of authors such as Kay Redfield Jamison and Oliver Sacks, a biologically-oriented psychiatrist and a neurologist respectively.	1998-02-06

Proponents of FC have responded by claiming that any kind of scientific study destroys the &quot;trust&quot; necessary for FC to work, and then demonstrating this &quot;trust&quot; by such practices as ignoring all non-facilitated attempts at communication, and even using physical force to hold some &quot;clients&quot; at the keyboard.

With great sensitivity and respect for the people with autism involved - indeed, greater sensitivity and respect than is shown by the &quot;facilitators&quot;, despite their rhetoric about trust - she documents the way in which the methods and practices of the &quot;facilitators&quot;, such as ignoring clear verbal and non-verbal signals which might conflict with the facilitated &quot;messages&quot;, in fact frustrate and abuse their clients, producing aggression, anxiety, attempts to escape, and even self-injurious behaviour.  <br /> This book should be read and heeded by everyone connected with the autism field, not only for its dazzling expose of FC, but also for its insight into the way in which a fanatically-defended ideology can end up riding rough-shod over the basic human rights of the people it purports to be helping.

Sutton accepts Bettelheim'sown picture of himself entirely at face value, and the book quicklyturns into a lengthy exercise in avoiding the issues. She notes first-hand reports of brutality towards the children in his care only to follow them with psychoanalytic explanations of why it was really for the child's own good that Bettelheim hit them - indeed, Sutton manages at one point to give the impression that hitting a small child for crying was a positively saintly act of altruism on Bettelheim's part. Bettelheim's frauds - such concocting and entirely fictitious CV - are excused as creative exaggerations. Even his faking of his own results is explained away by the ludicrous line: &quot;On a deeper level ... Bettelheim did not cheat&quot;. Any critics of Bettelheim's methods, are, it is snidely implied, acting out of their own deep emotional problems. <br /> In fact Sutton manages to get through the entire volume, including inordinate praise of Bettelheim's cruel and absurd &quot;The Empty Fortress&quot; (referred to by Leo Kanner as &quot;The Empty Book&quot;) without once mentioning that Bettelheim's notorious claim that autism was caused by parents' hatred of their child has been conclusively scientifically discredited. Nor does it seem to concern her that it caused years of suffering for parents told that their child's only hope was to be removed from them completely. Instead, she lauds Bettelheim's &quot;understanding&quot; of autistic children (although high-functioning individuals with autism are usually moved to hysterical laughter or fury by his interpretations) and even his psychoanalytic treatment of autism (although research shows it to be entirely ineffective). Anyone advocating an alternative view of autism is lambasted as cold, uncaring and only interested in neurology, and accused of wanting to train autistic children like animals, which is hardly an unbiased assessment. Given that Bettelheim's reputation was builtaround his &quot;treatment&quot; of autism, these omissions and distortions are culpable.	1997-10-05

For parents struggling to adjust to the  diagnosis of their child as autistic (or as having Asperger's syndrome or PDD), the stress is often compounded by simultaneously having to absorb vast amounts of information about their child's condition and their various options for treatment and education. Busy teachers, speech therapists and other professionals must also educate themselves rapidly about autism in order to deal with a child or adult who may have problems and gifts quite unlike those seen in any other disability. <br />  This book (along with Bryna Siegel's excellent &quot;The World of the Autistic Child&quot;) should help. Lorna Wing is both a renowned researcher and the mother of an autistic child.

Not only is the purported justification of this - that autism stems from a failure in mother-child bonding - one which has been scientifically discredited since the sixties, but for many autistic people (who often have tactile hypersensitivity that makes physical contact uncomfortable if not painful) the forced holding advocated here is nothing short of torture: a form of &quot;sensory rape&quot;. <br />  All forced holding can teach ANY child is that someone on whom you are completely dependent is prepared to ignore your screaming and struggling and physically overpower you.

Many of the points in this book are not only valid, they are obvious: psychiatric drugs are often over-prescribed, the pharmacological industry has a vested interest in selling them, psychiatry has in the past been guilty of appalling abuses and injustices, etc. But Breggin is trying to go further: he argues that no mental illness has any neurological basis, and therefore drugs can never be any use. In doing so, he ignores not only the vast amount of research which suggests that many mental illnesses have a significant biological factor, but also the voices of those people with schizophrenia, depression, manic-depression and other conditions for whom psychotherapy just isn't enough. In conjuring up a vision of wicked psychiatrists drugging their patients into a zombie-like state, or uncaring parents rushing to &quot;label&quot; their inconvenient children as insane, he ignores the fact that, while &quot;talk&quot; therapy works wonders for some, others find that the implicit message that they would be fine if only they tried hard enough to uncover the hidden trauma behind all their problems (i.e. accepted the therapist's own interpretation of what is wrong with them) is not only unhelpful but deeply destructive.<br /> One example illustrates Breggin's method of argument particularly well. In arguing that all psychiatric conditions are entirely psychogenic, the result of emotional trauma, he is led to the logical conclusion that autism must be also. Never mind the vast amounts of research which have conclusively and repeatedly disproved this vicious little myth. Never mind the many high-functioning autistic people, such as Temple Grandin and Donna Williams, who have described their own experiences and categorically rejected this explanation of their condition. Never mind that in the 1950s such beliefs led to many autistic children being removed from their families and subjected to years of totally ineffective and ludicrous psychoanalytic interpretation instead of an education, while their parents went through years of guilt and grief. Breggin Knows Best (despite the fact that he has no specialist knowledge or experience concerning autism). This is not only intellectually shoddy, it is irresponsible and cruel.<br /> Breggin's crude and scientifically-dubious presentation of the issues will not give anyone with a psychiatric condition the unbiased information we need in order to make up our minds for ourselves. I was left feeling bitter and angry at the thought that people's decisions might be swayed by such rubbisheducation, while their parents went through years of guilt and grief.
