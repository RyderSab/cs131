The book begins with the arrival of Bob Horner, a 29-year-old bonafide all star who was still in his prime when he arrived to play for the Yakult Swallows. Waiting for him when he landed at Narita Airport were 200 journalists, a team owner who confidently predicted--and expected--that the overweight Horner would hit 50 home runs (Horner was assigned the number 50 on his uniform as a not so subtle reminder), and a year contract worth $2 million. What Horner did not know was how different yakyu (literally, field ball) would be from the baseball he knew in America. The regimentation of Japanese teams, the rules governing many aspects of life both on the field and off--and the adjustment of moving around the world to live in a very different culture--had been and still is the undoing of many players. Whiting's work is about more than baseball and sports; it is about how Japan and Japanese approach things, how that which is imported must first be Japanized. Highly recommended.	2005-04-12

It was only a matter of time before a novelized version of the original story by Tomino-sensei appeared. Stone Bridge has once again proved why it is one of the more interesting publishing houses in the US. <br />The Gundam franchise began in 1979 and now has a worldwide following. In the Gundam universe the Earth Federation battles troublesome off-world colonies and \\"Newtype\\" warriors that feature suits of high-tech armor. This book presents Tomino's vision as outlined in the original Japanese series, but with perhaps even more vivid characterization and a shocking ending. <br />Translator Fred Schodt, the dean of American mangaphiles, has done a wonderful job of staying faithful to the original Japanese-and conveying meaning and nuance in hip mangaese. There is also an enlightening introduction by Gundam expert Mark Simmons. <br />For Gundam fans, Mobile Suit Gundam: Awakening, Escalation, Confrontation is as close to the Holy Grail as you are going to get. A stunning retelling of a classic story.	2005-04-12

Shuichi Shindo is determined to be a rock star. He has, however, a few small problems. He can't play, and, according to the book description: \\"has no experience, no talent, and no band.\\" After finding a rock-star caliber guitarist and getting a gig, he is now set to show the world he has what it takes-and, in particular, that his lyrics are world class. At this point, however, a writer named Yuki Eiri hears the gibberish-like lyrics and excoriates him and the drivel he has produced. Shuichi can't get the vitriolic criticism out of his head and forces his way into Yuki's life-eventually falling in love with her. A wonderful tale with one caveat: the English translation is only fair.	2005-04-12

Ten years ago or so the number of people outside of Japan who even knew what anime was was limited to a small but devoted number of maniacal fans. From Hayao Miyazaki to Osamu Tezuka, today anime is everywhere in the US and Europe, and increasingly popular in China and Asia. But where did Japanese animation come from, and what does it all mean? Cultural commentator Patrick Drazen has written a concise, witty, and lively guide for fans, those with a general interest in Japan, and even for those who have only the vaguest idea of what this omnipresent phenomenon really means and is. Drazen leads the reader through the characters and themes, styles and conventions, in a highly readable style. <br />Some of the major themes include: warriors, teenage girls, hardcore, the Japanese mother, nature, reincarnation, and more. The text also includes over 100 pictures. Moreover, at the end of the book are essays on 15 classic anime. This book is useful not only as a reference to Anime, but also as an insightful guide to contemporary Japanese culture. Last, there is a brilliant essay on Hayao Miyazaki and his organization. A great read.	2005-04-12

Her series was serialized in the Asahi Shinbun newspaper from 1949 until 1974. Kicking off in the dark and impoverished days following defeat in World War II, Sazae-san was a light and witty daily ray of sunshine for a Japan struggling to rebuild. In the course of its three decade run, it sold 62 million copies in book form; moreover, it has been made into radio programs and an animated television series. <br />Sazae-san is an upbeat if slightly ditzy woman. She lives with her utterly ordinary family who suffer her malapropisms and silly behavior with aplomb. This is a perfect place to take a peek into a typical if idealized Japanese family and neighborhood--with one slightly odd member. The book contains the original Japanese text along with an English translation, so this is a wonderful work for those studying Japan and its everyday customs.	2005-04-12

Forty-two ninth graders set off on what they assume is a graduation camping trip. However, they have actually been shipped out to the deserted island of Okishima to serve as contestants on The Program, a state-sponsored reality tv show. The premise of the show is simple and horrifying: within three days only one student shall remain alive. On top of this, all of the students have high-tech collars implanted in their collars to monitor their vital signs. If no one has died in the first twenty-four hours, a bomb will be set off to kill them all. Each student gets a survival kit-and then takes off. The kids come from all types of backgrounds. The main character Suuya fights to stay alive and to protect the girl he likes; others go at it Lord of the Flies style. Human nature at its basest. Manga at its best.	2005-04-12

It is about 10-year-old Negi Springfield, a young magician who has started work at a new school. He is about to learn a lot more than his ABCs; rather, Negi is about to set off on an adventure in which he will discover love and just how powerful he really is. Negi has just graduated from magic school and is sent to Japan to teach English to a group of junior high school students. One of his odder powers is the ability to remove girls' clothing by sneezing, which is very convenient since the school he has been shipped out to is an all-girls school. (Akamatsu-sensei revels in sexual innuendo, so if puerile humor is not to your taste, skip down to another book review.) Negi of course becomes an incredibly popular teacher at the school. However, Asuna, a hot-tempered young student who is in love with 30-year-old Professor Takahata, could care less about him while the other girls are causing pandemonium. (And, natch, Takahata-sensei is totally unaware of Asuna.) To make up for sneezing off her clothes on several occasions, Negi brews up a love potion for Asuna. You will have to suspend your disbelief-the idea of teenaged girls drooling over a 10-year-old boy, etc.-and if you can you are in for a treat: Akamatsu's drawing is marvelous and wild and a bit insane in places. Tongue-in-cheek: this is fun.	2005-04-12

The book begins as Japan is in the midst of the war. Gen is a normal, active boy who is more preoccupied with his own friends and life than that of the larger world around him. This world, however, is turned upside-down by the horror of what happens on a clear day in August 1945. Gen is a strong boy who manages to maintain his sense of humor in the face of the most trying situations. You will cheer along with him.

Manga! The World of Japanese Comics, in brilliant form. Dreamland is a series of essays that outline just what manga is, the otaku phenomenon, notable magazines, a who's who of individual artists and their work, and a lengthy chapter on Osamu Tezuka. <br />Japan is, as the author notes, a country \\"awash in manga.\\" Of all the books and magazines sold in Japan in 1995, manga accounted for a stunning 40%, or some 2.3 billion (that's 15 for every Japanese person). In dollars, the industry's annual worth is in the neighborhood of $7-9 billion. At some of Japan's prestigious publishing houses, manga are subsidizing the more serious art and literature they put out. <br />Yet, the real triumph of manga \\"lies in their celebration of the ordinary.\\" As a US comic artist notes, in the US comics are a caricature, while in Japan \\"it seems like most popular comics are...of normal people doing normal things.\\" Schodt goes further: manga are \\"an articulation of the dream world. Reading manga is like peering into the unvarnished, unretouched reality of the Japanese mind.\\" He concedes, though, that one must question what the overall effect of having so much information transmitted via the medium of a comic book-\\"that deliberately emphasizes deformation and exaggeration-has on a people. <br />Schodt's understanding of his theme and of Japan are breathtaking. His section on Tezuka, the originator of Kimba the White Lion and Astro Boy and many more titles, is especially well done. The God of Manga, for whom a museum has been constructed, was a friend of the author and contains many insights into a revered figure in Japan. Highly recommended-for manga and non-manga fans alike.	2005-04-12

Manga! is an improvement on an already stellar work. Schodt is a translator, writer, and critic on things Japanese-in particular manga. He writes in a fluent, articulate style that will persuade even the conservative high culture guardians that manga (and anime) belongs along with Kabuki and Noh and flower arrangement in the pantheon of great Japanese cultural gifts to the world. Manga! Manga! is meticulously researched and leavened with anecdotes from Schodt's many years in Japan. <br />When the first edition appeared, some twenty years ago, outside of Japan few even knew what manga was. Manga today is a major industry. In 1996, some 2.3 billion magazines were being churned out-or 40% of all publications in highly literate Japan. Adults are now being targeted with more plot-driven manga, and its export to Asia, Europe, and the US can be counted as one of Japan's great \\"industrial\\" success stories. <br />This version has been revised but retains the best of the 1983 section. Following an introduction by Osamu Tezuka, Schodt delves into the history of manga in a section that covers a thousand years of Japanese pictorial history. This includes native traditions, foreign influence, the War years, and more. The text then moves onto chapters on types of manga: samurai, women-centric, business, erotic. The last two chapters feature a behind-the-scenes look at those who produce the manga, and then an essay on the future of manga. At the end of the book are samples from four titans of manga-Osamu Tezuka, Reiji Matsumoto, Riyoko Ikeda, and Keiji Nakazawa. <br />Excellent. A great, great read.	2005-04-12

This selection is an autobiographical recording of the artist's career from 1963-2002. It chronicles in black-and-white and color the whims of the enfant terrible of the Japanese art scene-and the changes in Japan as well. Reviled by feminists for his frequent use of ropes and other implements to bind women, Araki remains unrepentant and upbeat. If that and his documentation of Japanese brothels is not your cup of tea, his lovely color shots of exotic flowers may be more appealing. They bring to mind some of Robert Mapplethorpe's work. However, it is the recurring motifs of rope, lizard, yukata, tatami, Tokyo street scenes, and above all the ever-present Japanese female nude that appear most often in this book. Also, Araki provides commentary (\\"Notes of a Photomaniac\\") on each picture, which has been translated into English.	2005-04-11

Nakane is a social anthropologist, and her analysis focuses on both the group structure and the vertical nature of Japan's society - in Japan your identity is based on what group you belong to, and your position within its hierarchy, what she refers to as \\"frame\\", rather than any individual \\"attributes\\" you may have. Using examples from assorted groups: companies, schools, political parties, associations of intellectuals, etc., she illustrates the dynamics of relationships within groups and also between groups, including the sometimes fierce competition that pervades inter-group rivalries, noting when the Japanese group dynamic increases efficiency of a group's aims, or decreases it. She makes comparisons with other societies, notably the U.S.A. and the Hindu caste system. As she says in her conclusion, Japan has undergone some drastic changes in the past 200 years, but the nature of social relations has stayed fundamentally the same. Her conclusion also gives a good explanation why democracy has a subtly different meaning in Japan than in western nations and why revolution is impossible in Japan. That Japan is a group-oriented and vertical society is well known, but reading this slim volume will show you some of the more subtle ways it operates and help you understand the pressures that constrain Japanese people in their daily lives.	2005-04-11

Shogun at the time of Onin War (1467-1477), which destroyed nearly all of Kyoto, Yoshimasa was a hapless leader who devoted himself instead to the pursuit of beauty. In this Period, Noh and ink painting flourished, the tea ceremony \\"originated in a small room at Ginakaku-ji where Yoshimasa offered tea to his friends,\\" and with it the Japanese art of flower arrangement was born. Keene acknowledges the judgment of most historians-that Yoshimasa was weak, extravagant, incompetent in affairs of state, and unable to end a meaningless war and its incumbent famine and suffering-yet posits that he has yet to be recognized for his contribution to Japanese arts and taste. In the midst of wholesale destruction, Yoshimasa precipitated a Japanese renaissance. <br />Though respecting his grandfather Yoshimitsu, the builder of the Golden Pavilion (kinkakuji), he had no interest in emulating either his life or works. Yoshimasa's Silver Pavilion stands in stark contrast to his grandfather's Golden Pavilion, the later coated in gold leaf, the former the epitome of Kyoto cool wabi sabi understatement. \\"The simplicity and reliance on suggestion of the buildings and gardens at Higashiyama may indicate that a man who had earlier exhausted the pleasures of extravagance had at last achieved a kind of enlightenment,\\" writes Keene. <br />This concise work is a complex web of murder, chaos, and endless war that destroys everything in its wake. And, simultaneously-amazingly, ironically, unbelievably-the Period gave birth to some of Japan's best-known art forms. As an insight into medieval Kyoto, there is no better place to begin.	2005-04-11

This new, greatly expanded edition only adds to its status. Organized crime in any country tends to share certain similarities. Their activities concentrate on gambling, prostitution, drugs, extortion, and smuggling. Also, they are usually very right-wing and nationalistic. The Yakuza are no exception, but there are some differences, \\"...it is as if the Ku Klux Klan and the Mafia formed an enduring, politically potent alliance.\\" The symbiotic relationship between Japan's political system, Big Business, and the Yakuza is a disturbing indication of the depth and prevalence of corruption and bribery in the world's second-largest economy. The authors (both American journalists) trace the roots of the Yakuza to its medieval beginnings, but most of the book concentrates on the period since the American Occupation, when the present form of Yakuza organization solidified (and also exposes the involvement of the CIA with the Yakuza's post-war growth). It documents the rise of the Yakuza into a multi-billion dollar enterprise with worldwide investments in real estate, art, big business and more. The original book ended before the bursting of the \\"Bubble Economy\\", and this new version picks up the story and shows how the Yakuza have adapted since then to the new economic climate. The authors also cover extensively the internationalization of the Yakuza, particularly their various attempts to move into America. A must-read for anyone interested in contemporary Japan and Japanese politics.	2005-04-11

Fleeing the racism and time in the ship's brig off Japan, Tanaka arrives on a swampy island inhabited by the descendants of slaves, lower class whites, and the self-obsessed denizens of an artist colony. <br /> <br />What ensues is at times hysterical: mistaken identity, self-delusion, pride, jealousy, hyperbole, and deceit. Tanaka, whose hippy mother became pregnant from a relationship with an American \\"barbarian\\", is taunted mercilessly as a \\"gaijin\\", though he was born and raised in Japan. He dreams of a place of half-castes and mixed-bloods, where he won't stand out. What he finds in America is misunderstanding and betrayal.	2005-04-10

Not exactly at last-others have trod this path before, notably the magazine Mangajin-but in book form Japanese the Manga Way is setting a precedent. <br />Author Wayne Lammers grew up in Japan and has written a \\"real manga, real Japanese\\" text and study aid that will benefit the many students struggling with nihongo. The text begins with basic pronunciation and works its way onwards and upwards, throughout supplemented with topical and humorous selections from Japanese graphic novels and comics. <br />Even for someone who has spent the better part of ten years studying Japanese, the format in which the material is presented in Japanese the Manga Way is refreshing and easy to understand. Lammers does an excellent job in explaining the use of Japanese particles, the bane of many a student. Another section that merits mention is that on giving and receiving-so crucial to life in Japan-that suddenly set off a lightbulb in this reviewer's often dim brain. <br />Highly recommended for both beginners and even those with a lot of classroom time under their belts.	2005-04-10

Abandoned by his company on Leyte Island, in the Philippines, as it is losing in a slow, agonizing battle with American forces, Tamura has nowhere to go, nothing to do. As he becomes further and further removed from the \\"society\\" of his regiment, his peers, Tamura begins to fall apart. He has come down with consumption and as such is no longer of any use to his platoon, which is facing annihilation. Food is the primary obsession of Japanese commanders - there simply isn't enough. The dying and wounded are therefore sent to the field hospital to be kept until they expire - or are kicked out when their food supply runs out. When Tamura, however, returns from a brief visit to the hospital, his commander slaps him brutally. \\"You damned fool! D'you mean to say you let them send you back here?\\" He is thus sent back again; the hospital, however, will not let in patients who don't have their own food. Without food, patients are pronounced \\"cured\\" and sent on their way. And thus begins an existential and brutal journey into a heart of darkness. <br />The story focuses on the gradual and permanent removal from society of Private Tamura. Slowly but surely, his ties to society are severed. Tamura, an intelligent and decent man, is thus completely alone in a war zone. He doesn't have a reason to die, so he stumbles about the Philippine countryside in search of food. While searching for sustenance, he must avoid both the local people and American soldiers. During his trials, Tamura carries on an internal dialog on his situation, which reads like a treatise on the existence of God. The imagery is poetic and horrifying, a portrait of a man's descent into hell. Haunting and powerful.	2005-04-10

A Japan you've never seen/never will see	College dropout, former student activist, veteran of the Japanese penal experience (one year in prison for aforementioned activism), one-time porn director, and poet, Genichiro Takahashi is the enfant terrible of Japanese letters. His Sayonara Gangsters is a wild, hysterical, and tender tale that almost defies description. The \\"action\\" takes place somewhere and sometime in the future in which people have no names. For lovers this presents a problem: what to call one another. The two main characters of Sayonara Gangsters decide upon Nakajima Miyuki Song Book for the woman, and Sayonara, Gangsters for the man and narrator, who is a teacher at a poetry school. Their milk-and-vodka loving cat is named Henry IV.  <br />The first part of the novel is about Sayonara, Gangsters's former lover and their daughter, who is called both Caraway and Green Pinky. At a point in which the novel appears to be settling into something a reader might vaguely recognize as \\"normal\\" - couple have child, are happy, begin to build a life - they receive a postcard from City Hall informing them of the impending death of their daughter. Sayonara, Gangster then describes his daughter's trip to the approved cemetery and burial therein - while Green Pinky talks to him throughout.  <br />In the second section, Sayonara, Gangster talks about his \\"job\\" at the poetry school, admitting that he has essentially no idea what he is doing. That, moreover, if there were some secret to writing poems - what the students expect to be taught - he wouldn't tell anyone but would rather write poems and become a Nobel laureate. The final part of the novel revolves around three yakuza who enroll in the poetry school - and then are shot and killed by the police. As weird as it sounds, the scene is simultaneously funny and stunning and vivid. As is the entire work. Michael Emmerich's translation is lively and captures the maniacal and protean talents of Sayonara, Gangsters author Genichiro Takahashi. This book cannot berecommended highly enough. Read it!	2005-04-10
US	51748342	R286USDM3Y8NAU	1400043662	478155730	Kafka on the Shore A novel	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Murakami's latest: A Tour de Force	Author of acclaimed works The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle and Norwegian Wood, Murakami is Japan's leading writer of fiction. He is an original, offbeat writer with a wild and uninhibited imagination. In his latest work, Kafka on the Shore, the 15-year-old Kafka Tamura runs away from home on a quest to find his long-lost mother and sister-and to be rid of his father's prophecy. As he flees, so too does the World War II veteran Nakata, an older, retarded man whose quiet life has been turned upside down by a murder. Nakata suffered an unstated injury during the War that left him unable to read or write but able to talk to cats. This double odyssey brings Kafka and Nakata metaphorically together, as they both struggle to understand their respective journeys and what life has in store for them. <br />Murakami has never been shy about blurring the line between reality and, for lack of a better word, the oddly unreal. And true to form, in Kafka the reader is treated to the following: fish raining from the sky, a pair of Imperial Army soldiers unaged and still in the forest, and even a brief appearance by the characters Colonel Sanders (as a pimp) and Johnnie Walker.  <br />Murakami is that odd writer who manages to pull off postmodern, biting work that says something-and is at the same time fun to read. Both in Japan and abroad, he has been dismissed by some as lightweight-in part no doubt because of his popularity. However, mixing high- and low-brow, Murakami blends and spins wonderful and wild tales. There are references to fashion, jazz, popular music, Truffaut, Natsume Soseki, and many more. In Kafka, a prostitute quotes Hegel; Greek tragedy and Plato put in an appearance; and then, of course, there is the talking cat. It might feel Lite, but Murakami is deep. <br />Nakata and Kafka converge though never meet in rural Shikoku, both on a metaphysical quest for an \\"entrance stone\\" that Nakata must open and close. For the younger boy, this is a passage into adulthood; for theolder man, a search for a soulmate. <br />For Murakami fans, this is a must; for those yet to experience Murakami's world, Kafka on the Shore is an excellent place to start.	2005-04-10

In An Artist of the Floating World, Kazuo Ishiguro serves up a fascinating look at pre- and postwar Japan. The novel is the story of Masuji Ono, an artist and devotee of the \\"floating world\\" of Japanese nocturnal pleasures. Prior to the war, however, he was a propagandist for Japan's war effort, and this is in different ways haunting him in the wake of defeat. The war now over, Ono is older and left to reflect on the past and his present. He lost his wife and son in the war, and is now living with one of his daughters. It is a time in which the young blame their elders for the mistakes of the past, and no longer accept the validity of the floating world-which was all but destroyed by 1945. What then is there for Ono? <br />The novel begins three years after Japan's defeat, and Ono is deeply involved in the negotiations of his younger daughter's proposed marriage. In the previous year his other daughter, Noriko, had her planned marriage abruptly cancelled by the groom's family. Ono now begins to wonder whether his artistic support of Japan's war effort is now putting at risk his second daughter's chances. <br />The most poignant moment in the book revolves around his relationship with Kuroda, his star art pupil, who was betrayed by Ono to the authorities. Ono attempts to justify the years that Kuroda spent in prison by rationalizing that those years now give him credibility in the new Japan.  <br />Ishiguro, who left Nagasaki at age 5 and moved to Britain, evokes a time and place and feeling with a deft and loving touch. An Artist of the Floating World documents the inner life of one man, and portrays the changing cultural attitudes. Whitbread Prize winner Ishiguro was shortlisted for England's Booker Prize for this work. Ishiguro pulls back layer after layer to reveal memory, or fragments of memory, that have profound meaning. Beautifully written.	2005-04-10

With a loyal following in countries as diverse as Italy, China, Brazil, the US, and her native Japan, Banana Yoshimoto is one of Japan's most well known writers. Kitchen, Yoshimoto's first novel, is the story of Mikage Sakurai, a young woman who has just lost her grandmother, her last living relative, and how she finds a new \\"family\\" when she is taken in by Yuichi Tanabe and his mother Eriko. The story revolves around Mikage's growing sense of belonging with her new and unusual family, and of the importance she attaches to the kitchen - her favorite place. This short novella explores how the concept of family can transcend traditional definitions. Mikage is accepted by Eriko, the transsexual bar owner (and Yuichi's father). Mikage finds sustenance and comfort in the kitchen, both literally and metaphorically, as she rebuilds her life.	2005-04-10

These were the military leaders who in theory served the Emperor in Kyoto, but who in practice ran the country. This period gave birth to much of what is now considered to be the core of Japanese culture: kabuki, ukiyoe, geisha, sumo, and the haiku poets. When Japan was finally forced to open to the outside world by Admiral Perry and his Black ships, at the very end of the book, Tokyo was the largest city in the world.  <br />Naito has organized his text chronologically, with much commentary on the construction of the Imperial Palace and land reclamation projections on and around Tokyo Bay. He also provides simple primers on the class system in effect-warriors, farmers, artisans, and merchants-and the slow rise of the commoners. <br />Perhaps inevitably, the text has a Greatest Hits feel to it. 250 years of history of one of the world's great cities cannot possible be conveyed with much depth in 200-odd pages. Also, the omission of some of the more unsavory aspects of Tokyo's history-organized crime, the untouchable class, etc.-leaves the reader with a rather sanitized version of the city. However, the book has something for everyone: the opening sections on urban design, kabuki, riots, storms, artisans, festivals, gangs, etc.-and all packaged in short, delectable bite-size bits.	2005-04-10

After taking the Frankfurt Book Fair by storm in 2003, the then titled Tsunami Bar, a novel about a blond British bargirl paid to flirt in a \\"hostess bar\\" in Osaka, was set to do the same for the world. The world, however, intervened. Just prior to publication, a real tsunami wiped out much of parts of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and elsewhere on December 26th. The publisher, fast on its feet, realized it had to make a quick name change-hence, Sayonara Bar.  <br />Before reading the actual book, the usual dread overtook me: another book by a former English teacher who spent perhaps two or three years in Japan. Another expert. Probably can't order from an izakaya menu. Would break out in hives at the ward office when filling out a simple form. <br />Then I read the book. It is no doubt heavily autobiographical: English woman goes to Japan planning to make some cash and then travel, but ends up working as an \\"economy geisha\\" and staying longer than she planned. What follows, I feared, would no doubt be snide commentary about Japanese, about the mizu shobai economy of such bars, and a blue-eyed expat's life in seedy Japan. In the process, however, the protagonist Mary comes into something darker and deeper than she bargained on-and the reader gets something both darker and deeper, too. Barker has a fluid style and writes sentences reminiscent of Haruki Murakami, observations like Natsuo Kirino. <br />The novel features several outstanding characters. While working as a hostess, Mary becomes involved with the bar mama's son, Yuji, who is connected to the Yakuza. And to which he professes the greatest loyalty. The introverted cook Watanabe observes all from an addled, manga-obsessed fantasy world. He believes he can perceive what others cannot. A third character, Sato the Salaryman, is an overworked lonely drone who finds solace in the smoke-filled bar, the only place he can forget his dead wife. <br />Barker's descriptions are spot on, the story a snapshot of a certain milieu but one that ultimately transcends it.	2005-04-10

The central character in Dance Dance Dance has recurring dreams about a Sapporo hotel he once stayed in years ago with a girlfriend who has since disappeared. He returns finally to the old Dolphin Hotel and finds it has been transformed into a chain hotel but has retained the original name.

Part document of the numbed state of teenagers in Tokyo, part manga-like read, this novella is the book for those with an interest in the underbelly of Shibuya youth culture, in particular of how young women are able to divorce their bodies from their minds in pursuit of money - and what they will do for it. <br />The protagonist of Innocent World, Ami, is Every Young Girl in Tokyo: educated parents who send her to a private school, an absent father, a young woman lacking nothing who is utterly devoid of feeling. The only possible twist is that her older brother is retarded. She discovers that she was the product of fertility treatments that involved a sperm donor not her father (her mother did not want another child with developmental problems, for which she blamed her salaryman husband). This leads Ami in pursuit of Number 307: the man who donated his seed. On the way she prostitutes herself - perhaps out of boredom, perhaps out of resentment - and becomes physically and emotionally involved with her half-brother. <br />A depressing if insightful read.	2005-04-10

The Dutch journalist spent more than thirty years reporting from Japan. Though the tenor of Japan's relationship with the outside world has changed considerably in the intervening years, much of what van Wolferen noted remains true. <br />Following publication, van Wolferen's speaking engagements dried up or were suddenly canceled, and he was tagged with the 'Japan basher' moniker. More than anything, van Wolferen had broken the taboo of uttering what all knew to be, on various levels, the truth about how Japan's political and bureaucratic culture functions. <br />In places the book is dense. The general reader can skip to relevant sections. They include pieces on education, the elusive Japanese state, the all-pervasive bureaucracy, the middle class, ritual in society, intimidation, the press, and others. Very persuasive.	2005-04-10

The novel begins with an earthquake and an arrest for murder. This is the story of Lucy Fly, an English translator living in Tokyo. It begins at the end-the murder of her friend Lily and the disappearance of her lover Teiji-and guides the reader towards the truth of what happened to them. Jones jumps between the present-Lucy being interrogated by the police as a suspect-and what lead to these circumstances. <br />Living alone and utterly content with her life in Tokyo, Lucy meets Teiji one rainy night as he is photographing a puddle in Shinjuku. Teiji is lithe and obsessive and laconic about his past. Not understanding what he does with all of the photos he takes (Teiji claims nothing), one day Lucy sneaks into his flat and peers into the world he has recorded on film. Having opened the proverbial can of worms-and caught in the act when Teiji comes home-Lucy yields to an intense jealousy about the previous woman in his life.  <br />This is compounded when Lily-an irritating, helpless nurse who befriends Lucy on the pretext of them both being from Yorkshire-and Teiji become involved on a trip that the three of them take to Sado Island. Lyrical in places, the novel is confident and insightful on the lives of the three main characters and on Japan itself. The earthquake-like ending will stay with you long after you have finished.	2005-04-10

In traditional media outlets, one is assaulted with ads. In Tokyo Pub Crawler, one gets the real deal from a female and male perspective. <br />The guide begins with basic bar Japanese, last train times for the major lines (pumpkin time in Tokyo usually around 12:30), and then is broken into 10 night spots plus Yokohama. Within each of these is a map and then the bar reviews. Dan ranks his with beer mugs, Gia with kisses. And they hold no punches. Dan on one mega-bar-complex in Omotesando: \\"I know some revere it, but I think this complex is, at least for nightlife, a soon-to-be-extinct giant dinosaur.\\" Ouch.

In a tiny boat he made his way alone to a Japan that had been closed off to the outside world for over two hundred years. The man was Ranald MacDonald, a half-Chinook, half-Scot who was following his dream of entering Japan to become an interpreter and English teacher.  <br />The first third of Schodt's definitive biography of this true-life adventurer covers Ranald's childhood and youth growing up on the coast of the Pacific Northwest, where he first heard the stories of the \\"three Kichis\\", 3 Japanese who had landed on the Pacific coast of North America a few years before. As part of the Japanese government's policy of seclusion, it was illegal to build vessels capable of ocean voyages, consequently many boats encountered storms and drifted out to sea, unable to navigate back to port. Numerous boats drifted for months, and the lucky ones were picked up, usually by whaling ships, and dropped off at Hawaii or the west coast of America.  <br />To fulfill his dream, Ranald became a whaler, because at the time it was the whaling fleets that were having increasing contact with the mysterious closed-off Japan. After finally arriving off the coast of Hokkaido, MacDonald was promptly arrested and held for a while before being taken to Nagasaki to await deportation. While imprisoned in Nagasaki he befriended his jailers and interrogators, and secretly kept notes on the Japanese language and customs which later proved useful to the Americans negotiating with Japan after Perry's famous \\"Black Ships\\" encounter in the 1850s. His main interrogator also became the Japanese govenment's chief translator for Perry's mission.  <br />A fascinating look at a little-known personality and adventurer who as an individual helped in the opening of Japan, the author has thoroughly researched the story both in Japan and the U.S., and the book is useful for the details and glimpses it provides of Japan in atime of change.	2005-04-10

In this period, Japan entered the world stage hellbent on modernizing and catching up with the imperial powers of the West. Donald Keene, the dean of Japan studies and Professor Emeritus at Columbia, attempts to paint a picture of the Emperor for whom the period is named and about whom little is known. His name and the period are of course extremely well-known, both inside and outside of Japan; but the life of the Meiji Emperor himself remains hidden. <br />Drawing extensively from the Tenno no Ki, or official imperial diary, and other Japanese sources, Keene fills in the many blanks of the life of a man often derided as a mere figure-head. When the Meiji Emperor began his rule, in 1867, Japan was not a unified country per se; it was dominated rather by the shogun and the daimyos, who ruled over Japan's more than 250 decentralized domains. However, these rabidly xenophobic men yielded ultimately to a new constitution and Japan was on the road to becoming a modern state. <br />Keene's biography begins with the emperor's traditional education; we see the formal occasions that acquainted the young emperor with his subjects; have a ringside seat at his court, marriage, and his relationships with various consorts. This is a massive tome that will keep the reader hoping for more and sorry to see its 900-plus pages end.	2005-04-10

The protagonist is Harry Niles, the son of bible-thumping Kentucky missionaries who are often far from their home, in Tokyo, saving Japanese souls-which leaves young Harry to run wild on the streets of Tokyo. He grows up in the 1920s on the streets of Asakusa, the old entertainment district of Tokyo, a raffish and wild and entrepreneurial American boy getting into trouble and fun with his Japanese pals.  <br />This places him in an odd position as Japan's military machine in the 1930s begins its suicidal rout of Asia and, ultimately, Pearl Harbor. In addition to his black market activities, Harry becomes increasingly suspect-mainly by the Japanese military but also by American and British diplomats and business people. And justifiably so: he is a spy. As Japan prepares to attack the US, Harry walks a tightrope-stay in Japan with his Japanese lover, flee with the wife of the British Ambassador-as his is pursued by a mad, brilliant army officer whom he offended in Nanking many years earlier during Japan's murderous occupation. <br />Though Smith dredges up the occasional anecdote familiar to anyone resident in Japan more than a year or so, the story crackles with intensity. A great read.	2005-04-10

In spite of the Dutch experience during the War, Buruma concludes that Germany has faced the past honestly and directly; Japan, on the other hand, continues to try to ignore or rewrite it. In school in the common language of modern Germany, young people are well attuned to and aware of the issues of the past. Young Japanese are either ignorant or indifferent to what their grandparents took part in. Buruma examines the issues of chauvinism, the history of nationalism, contemporary pacifism, and how Auschwitz and Hiroshima have been remembered and memorialized. Drawing on his childhood in Holland and the ten years he spent in Japan, Buruma is well positioned to comment on modern Germany and Japan. Highly recommended.	2005-04-10

It draws in the reader with its letter-perfect character descriptions and tightly-constructed plot. Kirino's novel was originally published in Japanese under the same title in 1997. It was a cause celebre selling 300,000 copies and won Japan's top mystery award in 1998. Prior to that, Kirino won the Naoki Prize with \\"Yawarakana Hoho\\" (Tender Cheeks). <br /> <br />This hard-boiled novel examines the interrelationships between four women factory workers, who are drawn into covering up the murder one of them commits. This leads to more intrigue and, ultimately, the central premise of the novel: what would you do in similar circumstances? Would you reject a friend's entreaty? If yes, why and how? If no, could you take part in the horror--and then go back to your previous life? The main character is the brilliant but ordinary-seeming Masako Katori, who works the night shift in a factory. When a co-worker murders her husband, Katori steps forward and enlists the help of two other women in covering up the crime. Katori lives with and takes care of her sexless and depressed husband and her sullen teenage son who no longer speaks to her. <br /> <br />To pigeonhole \\"Out\\" as a detective novel does no justice to it. For those who have lived in Japan for many years--or for those who only have the vaguest idea of Japan--this is stunning portrayal of the anomie of modern Tokyo. The portrayals of a Brazilian immigrant, a Yakuza nightclub owner, a Chinese hostess, the working class police detectives, and of course the women themselves are spot-on. Brilliant.	2005-04-10
US	51748342	R3VP3QMUPTAWXH	1566916720	931976827	Living Abroad in Japan	Books	5	25	25	N	N	Must Have Guide	Ruthy Kanagy has produced a comprehensive and useful guide for those thinking of taking the plunge across the Pacific and moving to Japan. Living Abroad in Japan joins many other well-done titles put out by the publishers Living Abroad In. Kanagy, herself born and raised in Tokyo, approaches her subject as only an insider could. The book assumes the reader knows nothing but does not speak down to her-and is well written and full of detail. It is neatly broken into chapters on Japan (history, government, economy, people, culture), daily life (moving, language, health, employment, finance, communications, travel, and housing), and \\"prime living locations\\" (Tokyo, Hokkaido, Kansai, Nagano, and Hiroshima). <br />The back of the book too is filled with useful indices: contacts, a phrasebook, suggested reading/films, clothing sizes, and an index. Having lived in Japan-Tokyo and Kyoto-for 15 years, I thought this would be a guide for someone just off the boat (i.e., not for me). It most certainly is for those new to or thinking of coming to Japan; however, it is much more than that. Even for the long-term resident of Japan, this is an invaluable guide.	2005-04-10

In spite of a somewhat flippant-but nevertheless clever-title, Being A Broad in Japan covers all the details women will have when living in Japan. It is comprehensive on, among other topics, survival (emergencies, finance, hair, etc.), home, health, relationships, becoming a mother, jobs and the workplace, Japanese language, and leaving Japan. <br />However, this guide is much more than a list or a yellow pages-though it is both of those. It is interspersed with quotes and anecdotes from the lives of many women who have struggled with some aspect of living in Japan. In the section on relationships, one woman voices the commonly heard refrain about western men in Japan: \\"Foreign guys are a big disappointment here. Mostly, they aren't interested in foreign women. Also, I find that many of them, after getting so much attention in Japan, start thinking they are really great.\\" Another women touches on the loneliness many feel, in particular for lesbians: \\"If I were in New York, not only would I have more women to choose from for potential friendship, I would also have a developed circle of friends to support me. I have not been on my own in 18 about years-and the loneliness, coupled with the foreign land, has been profound...\\"  <br />There is much advice, many a telephone number, basic Japanese language support, and much more. Indispensable for both those coming and for those still struggling with some aspect or another of Japan.	2005-04-02
