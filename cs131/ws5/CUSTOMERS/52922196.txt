However, this one left me cold. Earth Made of Glass is one of only two or three books in my life that I have abandoned  mid-read. Although doing his usual fine job at painting a vivid picture of  a world and culture, John Barnes has made his main characters so depressing and unpleasant that it's hard to care about them. And, after all, it's the characters that drive a novel. Once you don't give a darn what happens to the main characters, there's no reason to keep reading.    I suspect that John Barnes had recently gone through a divorce or other unpleasant event in his life, because his main character Margaret has all the brushmarks of  a \\"revenge\\" character. She is whiny, incoherent, unreasonable, and thoroughly unpleasant. She bursts into tears for no reason, punishes  her husband because he is not the youth he was 20 years ago, and irritatingly, constantly bemoans the state of her own middle-aged body. I somewhat remember acting this way when I was 13 and deep in the throes of adolescence. But I grew out of it darn quick. I kept wanting to shake her and tell her \\"Deal with it!\\" And Giraut's response is hurt confusion and a tendency to run away from the problem. Pack your bags and leave, buddy!    Being a middle-aged woman who has been with my husband for 25 years, I know well the stress of not having your life turn out the way you planned it but, I swear, if I am ever as unpleasant to my husband as Margaret is to hers, I give my husband full permission to drop a bucket of ice water on my head.    I suppose it is a testament to the  book that I became so emotionally involved with the characters to the point that I wanted to kick them in the kiester, but this book is just too  depressing and irritating to take a place in my library.	2004-11-30

I just happened upon this book, and I'm now a confirmed Ross Macdonald fan!<br /><br />I am amazed by reviewers that revile a book written over 20 years ago because it does not match the mores and attitudes of today.<br /><br />One of the charms of this book is that it beautifully captures Southern California in the 60s. I was there, guys, and women did not act or dress the way they do now. Don't judge this book out of the context of its era. Instead of being irritated because the book does not portray today's world, enjoy the ride into the past!<br /><br />As for Macdonald's writing, it was masterful! With a few well chosen phrases, he sets the stage and immerses you in his world. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and look forward to reading more.	2004-11-04

I can see that folks needing specific details on web development would not appreciate this book. <br /> <br />However, for me, since I wanted a general discussion of how companies develop web sites, it was perfect. My experience in web development for small and medium-size companies tells me that the problems and solutions presented in this book are very real-world. <br /> <br />Unlike many books of this type, this book was actually well writen and interesting to read! Nakano makes what could have been very dry discussions more entertaining by including real-life scenarios.  <br /> <br />The book takes you through web development processes, all the way from the one-man shop to the huge, mega-corporation. Yes, it does not give implementation details, but I think it does a very nice job at explaining the basic models in a black box way. (It is up to you to decide how you are going to do version control or enterprise content management.)	2004-10-30

After more than 4,000 reviews have been written about this book, what's left to say?<br /><br />I love this series of book and listen to them on CD in the car. They really make my long commute bearable. This book is quite different from the earlier ones in a number of ways:<br /><br />1) Good news: Harry is growing up. This book shows a bit darker side of 14-year old Harry, who is perhaps going through adolescent angst. He has a rather long-lasting argument with his best friend Ron that shows Harry to be stubborn and sometimes unreasonable. He also has his first crush on a girl, which increases his state of confusion. I felt this increasing complexity of his character adds a welcome depth to the series.<br /><br />2) Bad news: The book overall is darker than previous ones. While there are still traces of humor in this book, there are also rather frightening scenes (the opening scene in which a muggle is killed and scenes at the end involving torture and death). I'm not sure this is appropriate for very young children.<br /><br />3) Bad news: For the first time, I became aware of long, long passages of exposition. (Since I listen to these books on CD,  it is very noticeable when one character spends twenty minutes explaining background material.) Rowling's strength has always been moving the story along quickly and entertainingly--having a character explain something rather than showing it is surprising for her.<br /><br />4) Good news: The reader of the audio book, Jim Dale, is fantastic! He easily takes on the persona of each character and I quickly forget I am listening to someone reading. What a great actor he is! He has done all of the Harry Potter audio books and is a great choice!	2004-10-29

I had been looking for a baseball scorecard book that was small enough to put in my purse when I go to a game. This book exceeded my expectations!    It has a nice sturdy ring binding that lets you fold the book over to just the page you want to use, and it is a very nice size. However it has a lot of other features:    1. A pencil pouch on the outside of the book keeps your pencil handy. Nice idea!    2. Very nice design: attractive color printing, amusing cartoons, fun extras.     3. Although the scorecards themselves are attractive, but plain--all business, in other words--there are lots of other pages that would be fun for kids and casual scorekeepers for keeping track of all the details of a game: what you ate, who sang the national anthem, who you went to the game with, etc. And there are also pages for people who are playing baseball to keep track of your own stats. Although I probably won't use those extra pages, I think kids would love them.    4. The book contains some basic instructions on how to keep score, which I found useful.    All in all, a great book. Too bad it doesn't seem to be published anymore. I had to buy mine from a private seller.	2004-10-29

How delicious it is to discover a new series by great authors! I picked this book up by chance and I loved it.     The Gears have written an entire series of books, each one of which is a novel set among a different pre-historic culture in North America.     The Gears do an exceptional job at researching and presenting a culture. The archaeological details they provide give their story an authenticity that feels very real. \\"The People of the Mist\\" is set around 1300 A.D. in the Chesapeake Bay area. Unlike many other novels set in prehistoric times, this book neither looks down on the characters as \\"primitive,\\" nor does it glamorize the characters as being unrealistically heroic or noble. Instead, these are very real people caught up in the same political and survival problems as people today, but in a different setting. Interspersed throughout the novel are interesting tidbits on how the people of these coastal villages hunted, cooked, and maintained family and clan relationships.    Set against this fascinating background, the book presents a well thought out murder mystery that has all the twists and deadends you could wish for.     I could hardly put this book down, and spent several late nights and overly-long lunch hours reading it as quickly as I could.    Excuse me while I get back onto Amazon and find and buy all of the rest of the books!	2004-10-18
US	52922196	R21JW7IPLLZUSJ	1585860409	749196504	The Grey Horse	Books	5	12	12	N	Y	Charming fantasy with "horse sense"	I first read R.A. MacAvoy's \\"Tea with the Black Dragon\\" many years ago, and it remain one of my favorite books. So I was so glad to see some of her other books being reissued.    The Grey Horse is a lovely, charming fantasy that works on so many levels. Set in an 1881 village in Ireland, it is the story of a fairy horse, Rauri, who falls in love with a village girl and wants to marry her. And yet it is so much more than that!     What could have been a trite, two-dimensional story by another writer comes alive in the hands of R.A. MacAvoy for her characters are alive and vivid. Rauri is not an elegant, ethereal fairy, but an earthy, sometimes confused man who shares much of the stubborness and behavior of the sturdy Connemara pony he often turns into. Not innately clever, he has \\"horse sense\\" and a good nature that is very appealing. His heart's desire, Maire, is likewise not the usual fairy tale heroine. She is a big girl, stubborn, and full of fire, not as pretty as her petite sister, but of infinitely more worth.    Underneath the romance between Rauiri and Maire lies the struggle of the Irish people to assert their independence against the English overlords. The struggle of the Irish peasants to keep their connection to their land while dealing with a foreign culture (English) and the struggle of the fairy to fit into a foreign culture (Human) while retaining his deeper and more ancient connection to the land gives the book an interesting dynamic tension.    This book is one of the more interesting fantasies, and will retain a place on my bookshelf for future reading!	2004-10-02

I thought this was a rather nice example. <br /> <br />Mercedes Lackey combines an historical romance with the fairy tale of sleeping beauty and comes up with something really different. As far as I could tell, her research of England in the 1890s is very accurate. There were very nice references to William Morris and the Arts and Craft movement, pre-Raphealite art, William Blake, and contemporary political issues such as child labor and votes for women that added to my enjoyment of the book. <br /> <br />She does a marvelous job at breathing life into characters. The main character is a spunky 17-year old who seems natural and appealing.  <br /> <br />On the whole, I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes historical novels who is ready to try something a little different. <br /> <br />Is it great literature? No. But it is a competent work and an enjoyable read.	2004-07-22

What's not to like?<br />However, this book simply missed the mark. It felt like a blend of \\"Lives of the Rich and Famous\\" mixed with a James Bond movie. Everyone lives in rich splendor, is very attractive, and yet there is no real conflict or emotional depth to this book. Lots of action, yet it all seems so superficial and contrived. The main character, Nell, seems to wring her hands a lot and go through a lot of emotional trauma, and yet I just don't seem to care... Her character starts out so meek and submissive that even when she gets rolling, she still isn't very appealing.<br />I was frustrated because I could see glimmerings of a great book in there somewhere, but ultimately it just failed to satisfy.	2004-07-02
US	52922196	RSHZKB8C10RBQ	0440225108	7077895	The Plague Tales	Books	5	27	28	N	Y	Fun Bio-Thriller!	This book would be great to take on an airplane or to read on the beach if you want an exciting, but not too deep, read. <br />A really clever plot keeps you wondering right from the beginning. Two alternating tales of bubonic plague in the 14th century and disease outbreaks in the 21st century future keep you guessing what the connection between the two tales might be. <br />Both tales are equally fascinating: One is the story of a wandering Jewish physician from Spain who is unwillingly caught up in the political intrigues between Pope Clement and King Edward of England while trying desperately to hide the secret of his past. His experiences of plague in medieval Europe are frightening and grotesque. The other tale is of a woman physician, Janie Crowe, of the near future who has suffered heartbreaking loss due to outbreaks of unspecified diseases that have swept America and threaten Europe. Hysterical fear of these diseases have changed the face of modern civilization--air travelers are forced to wear sterile suits and masks and powerful Bio Cops are authorized to shoot and kill if it is suspected that a citizen harbors disease. Janie is engaged in research in London, and unearths something that has a connection to the 14th century physician.<br />As the book progresses, these separate stories begin to entertwine, bringing us to an interesting conclusion. <br />Benson does a wonderful job of making both stories compelling and equally interesting, and she gives you tantalizing clues concerning how the earlier story will come to bear on the future one. However, a slightly supernatural thread just doesn't fit with the technological bent of the book, weakening it.<br />Inevitably, comparisons will be drawn between this book and &quot;Doomsday Book&quot; by Connie Willis, a Nebula and Hugo award winner which contains the story of Kirin, a student in future London who is mistakenly sent back to a 14th century English village just when plague is breaking out. Like &quot;Plague Tales,&quot; the Willis book alternates between the 14th century and England of the future. While superficially similar, &quot;Plague Tales&quot; is much more of a bio-thriller that is a fun book to read once and then pass along to a friend, while &quot;Doomsday Book&quot; is a deeper, more polished book with a stronger emotional impact that you will want to read again and again. Interesting how two different authors can come up with such different takes on a similar subject.	2004-06-28

I work long hours and have a long commute. I usually don't get home until 8 or 9PM, and that's just too late to go to the grocery and cook a meal from scratch! For years I've been making double recipes for weekend meals and then having the leftovers throughout the week, but in a kind of hit or miss fashion. Several nights a week, my husband and I would look at each other and say &quot;What's for dinner?&quot; When I discovered this book, I slapped myself on the forehead and said &quot;Doh!&quot;<br />It makes perfect sense to devote a little extra time on the weekend to building up a store of meals in the freezer. Why didn't I think of this before?<br />I liked the authors' approach to laying out the planning and preparation for the big cooking day. There is a lot of great information here on freezing and batch cooking. Great worksheets and checklists to help you get organized.<br />However, I must say that the recipes are not to my family's taste. Maybe it's a regional thing (we live in Southern California), but these recipes seem kind of 1960s and bland to us. (Cream of chicken soup is featured in several of them. Well, my Mom used that in her casseroles, but I don't!) Maybe it's because the recipes are aimed at kids. (We have none.)<br />We prefer recipes with more spices and variety (I cook a lot of Thai, Indian, Chinese, and Japanese dishes). However, I do not regret buying this book. All the info other than the recipes is very helpful and make this book worthwhile. I've simply adapted my own recipes to this plan.<br />One last note--most people won't care about this, I know, but I've been in the documentation business for 30 years, so I do. The format of the book is slightly amateurish. Although easy to read, the charts look hand-drawn, and the fonts and page layout look like someone put it together in Microsoft Word. I would expect something a little more polished for my money.	2004-06-17

The authors explore many different standard recipes, and provide a fascinating discussion of the best way to make those recipes. <br />For example, if you find that your peanut butter cookies just don't come out like Grandma's did, turn to the &quot;Cookies, Brownies, and Bars&quot; chapter, and find a detailed discussion of what works and what doesn't when making peanut butter cookies--what kind of shortening, what kind of peanut butter, etc. And then, you are presented with the optimum recipe based on their experimentation.<br />By going through this book, you absorb not just specific recipes, but an understanding of basic cooking principles. I curl up with it on the couch at night and just start reading! It's that interesting!<br />I'm thinking that beginning cooks wouldn't find this book nearly as interesting as people who have been cooking for a while, because most of the fun of the book is you saying to yourself, &quot;Yes! Exactly! I've seen that too! Is THAT why it came out that way?! NOW I know!&quot;<br />Even if you aren't that interested in the wheres and whyfors, however, this book contains hundreds (maybe thousands! It's HUGE) of great recipes from Apricot Muffins to Sauteed Zucchini.<BR>When I wanted to know the best recipe for Buttermilk Waffles so I could get the best results out of my new waffle maker, this is the book I turned to.<br />Every serious cook should have this book on her/his shelf.	2004-06-17

This book is not that!    Instead, it's a meandering, enjoyable chat with a knowledgeable friend about baseball on a summer afternoon on the porch. Vince Staten frames his entire book around a big league game he attended with his grown son, but somehow every facet of that experience leads off on a tangent to a fascinating exploration of baseball stadium and game trivia from the ticket buying experience (which leads to essays on ticket printing and turnstiles), to telling his son about the time a shortstop lost a ball because it bounced off a pebble (which leads to an in-depth interview of a groundskeeper), to a certain snugness in the stadium seat (which leads to a well researched essay on studies through the decades of the width of the typical American backside).    These essays have certainly made my baseball game experiences more enjoyable and given me a store of trivia to trot out at parties!	2004-06-08

From the very first words of this book, you know that you are in the hands of a master. This is the most beautifully written mystery I've ever read!<br />The pace is leisurely, but that's all to the good. By taking its time, the book gives you the chance to really get to know the main character, Jack/Jordan, and he is one of the most compelling characters in fiction. 1940s America and life in a small-town radio station are beautifully evoked. What impressed me most is that, unlike many historical novels which seem to be a frozen slice in time with no antecedents, this book has enough references to culture and events in the 1930s that the wartime in which the book is set makes sense and has context. Jack himself, who has bummed around race tracks doing menial jobs like horse walking, seems very much a man of the 1930s Depression, rootless and scraping by, but looking for something to cling to.<br />The mystery itself is satisfyingly complex. In fact, through most of the book, you're not even sure what the mystery is! Who is after Jack and why?<br />I was sad to reach the end of the book, because I wanted to spend more time in this world.	2004-05-25

However, it seemed to try too hard to suit all audiences. The danger in that, of course, is that it doesn't do a great job for any one type of reader. I got this book for the basic baseball knowledge it contains--I recently got &quot;hooked&quot; on baseball, and wanted to know more about the rules, how to keep score, how statistics are computed and what they mean. And there is some of that in this book. However, a great deal more of the book is aimed at little leaguers--how to pick out equipment, how to practice, and so on. Then there are the sections on great players. I think the readers who pick up this book are going to want more in-depth information on the particular area they are interested in. So, this book may be your first book on baseball, but it won't be your last! Just whets the appetite, so to speak.<br />The book tries to do too much, and would have better served the reader by concentrating on one area. Nonetheless, Joe Morgan comes across as very knowledgeable and a great guy!	2004-05-08

Interweaving such elements as Buddhism, yetis (abominable snowmen), exploitation of third-world countries by the West, and very believable descriptions of climbing expeditions in the Himalayas and the crazy people who undertake them, this book has a warm and gentle heart.

After reading the first Merrily Watkins novel, Midwinter of the Spirit, I grabbed every Phil Rickman book I could find. Although I enjoyed them all, it is the Merrily series that has won my heart.<br />What a fabulous job Rickman does at creating three-dimensional, believeable characters! Merrily and her daughter are modern women, spirited and complex, with all the doubts and insecurities of any modern woman. Merrily, a single mom and Anglican priest, has been made the diocese exorcist, which is bound to put a strain on her relationship with her teenaged daughter, Jane, who leans more to paganism than organized religion.<br />As a background for these mysteries, the complex relationship between the troubled teenager and her mother provides a counterpoint to the greater conflict between good and evil that permeates these books.<br />This book in particular is especially interesting. A village man has confessed to horrific murders, and there is no doubt that his fellow villagers consider him very odd indeed. But, as Merrily is dragged into this situation, she has to deal with the fact that his actions may have been influenced by something beyond his control--but is the evil that influenced him man made or demonic? And are there other evil-doers at work?<br />I found this book to be a very satisfying mystery, and enjoyed the way that the relationship between Merrily and her daughter continues to unfold.	2004-03-31

Colorful, Attractive, and Fun to Use	I've used a variety of guides for various trips, and I find that I now look for AAA guides more and more. Somehow I just use the AAA guides more often than the others even when they are all in my suitcase.<br />Just like other AAA guides, this one is colorful, attractive, and fun to use. Here are some reasons why I think it is better than other guides:<br />1) With lots of great photos, this guide gives you a really good idea of what things look like, which gives you a better idea of whether an attraction is one you want to see. This also makes the guide so attractive, that it is just fun to use!<br />2) While not as comprehensive as some other guides, the AAA guides point out the best sights and attractions, which are the things you want to see anyway. In the case of Vancouver, where there is SO much to see, this really helps you narrow down your list!<br />3) The spiral format makes the guide very easy to use as it lays flat or folds flat. (Nothing like trying to juggle an awkward guide while balancing a tote bag, carryon bag, and a purse! Ease of use counts!)<br />4) The guides contain fun activities like suggested walking tours along with fun facts about locations that you won't find in other guides. For example, the guide mentions that the very first ambulance in Victoria (I think it was 1919?) had as its first patient someone who was run down by the ambulance! You won't get that kind of info anywhere else! (And maybe you don't want to, but I like that kind of trivia!)	2003-12-04

This guide was invaluable on my recent trip to Amsterdam!<br />Even though I had other guides with me, I used this one the most because:<br />1) With lots of great photos, this guide gives you a really good idea of what things look like, which helps you decide whether an attraction is one you want to see. <br />2) While not as comprehensive as some other guides, the AAA guides point out the best sights and attractions, which are the things you want to see anyway.<br />3) The spiral format makes the guide very easy to use as it lays flat or folds flat. (Nothing like trying to juggle an awkward guide while balancing a tote bag, carryon bag, and a purse! Ease of use counts!)<br />4) The guide contains fun activities like suggested walking tours along with fun facts about locations that you won't find in other guides. The walking tours along the canals were wonderful, and helped us get a real feel for the city.	2003-12-04

As a technical writer for 25 years, I was pleased to find that I learned a few things from it. And although some of the topics seem common-sense rather than innovative, it never hurts to be reminded of the basics.<br />I also like the format of the book--it's very easy to find specific topics and to dip into it to answer a specific question. I am buying a copy for each writer in my publications department!	2003-11-26

Small and plastic-coated, they tuck into a purse or backpack easily, don't tear or get wrinkled, and they are colorful and attractive. This particular map is very small and yet very easy to read, and gives you everything you need to know about Vancouver, Stanley Park, University of British Columbia campus, downtown Vancouver, the Vancouver area, and even downtown Victoria, which is across the channel on Vancouver Island. Tourist spots are all noted, along with major hotels. It really is the best way to see a city! I get one for every city I go to.	2003-11-26

Using it, I found some really nice, out of the way spots that weren't mentioned in standard guidebooks. I also found it a little friendlier and easier to use than some of the other guidebooks. The only downside is that the maps are kind of hand-drawn and not quite as precise and detailed as those in other books.	2003-11-13

I have just discovered the Merrily Watkins series of novels, and I couldn't be more thrilled. Phil Rickman manages to create the perfect blend: interesting characters with a lot of depth, mystery with a tinge of the supernatural, and charming recreation of English village life.<br />In this particular book, Merrily (a priest in the Anglican church) scouts out the village that will be her next post, and participates in a seemingly harmless ritual in an ancient apple orchard. Although the ritual is meant to embue the orchard with new life and increase the apple harvest, it is enacted by a yuppie couple who only intend to promote commercialism in the village and increase tourism. Something goes very wrong, and an old man dies in a particularly horrible and bloody way.<br />Throughout the rest of the book, we see this dynamic tension between the modern world and the darker, \\"old\\" ways of the English countryside. While all this is going on, we get to know Merrily and her feisty daughter who both have their own problems adjusting to small village life. Rickman does a great job of keeping us on the edge of our seat, as we wonder how Merrily will resolve her position in the church with the undeniably powerful dark forces that confront her.<br />I must say that I never saw the ending coming, and was pleased by the clever resolution.	2003-10-27

In addition to all the phrases you need at the airport, hotel, restaurant, shopping, and when driving, it even has such extended sections as phrases at the beauty salon and when camping! In addition, it also contains several very useful sections on how to read road signs, and a complete list of foods so you can figure out menus.

This one has an underlying theme of redemption and hope that is very appealing. What kept me fascinated and unable to put the book down was the skillful interweaving of present day characters who are tenuously connected to characters hundreds of years in the past. And influencing those characters is a subtle struggle between good and evil. I thought this story worked on so many levels, and I was sorry when it was over.<br />Additionally, I thought this book showed a very realistic view of English society and city life that is remarkable for a lady who lives in Texas!	2003-08-19

I must say, this cookbook is outstanding. Every recipe I've tried has come out incredibly good, and most of the recipes I've tried are only 4 or 5 points (Weight Watchers will know what I mean!).<br />This is a collection of ethnic recipes that you might be able to order take-out, but they are done the Weight Watchers healthy way. Although, I must admit that my local Thai restaurant doesn't have all of these great dishes! The Coconut Curry Pork Satay is to die for, as is the Thai Velvet Corn Soup! And there are great Indian, Mexican, Deli, Italian, and Chinese recipes too.<br />I can imagine that, depending on where you live, some readers may find some of the ingredients hard to find, but here on the West Coast, our local supermarkets carry Thai fish sauce, coconut milk, and the like.<br />The cookbook is designed really well, attractive and easy to read with photos to guide you.<br />Full of interesting flavors, these recipes are pretty quick to make.

How much is it? Good morning, etc.). One of the things I liked about it was, it was short and simple, short enough to listen to on the airplane (hence the name). After all, most people in the Netherlands speak very good English. I just wanted to learn enough Dutch to be courteous. Although the packaging said you can use it without the accompanying booklet, I wouldn't advise it! The phrases are spoken once without being repeated, and I needed the book to keep up. Besides, its useful to know how Dutch looks written.	2003-08-19

His main character, Alan Banks, is a complex, compassionate police inspector with problems of his own. A thoughtful man with a love of classical music, Banks does not have the literary knowledge of Shakespeare or contemporary myster writers of his author. (I thought it amusing that one of the characters makes a flip comment comparing Banks to a P.D. James detective which goes completely over Banks' head.)<br />Robinson cleverly weaves elements of Shakespeare, classical liturgical music, and sexual identity into a complex psychological mystery. As always, Robinson portrays Yorkshire in a convincing, vivid way.<br />A satisfying read, this book is not quite up to the standards of his later works. That doesn't take anything away from this book, but simply reflects how much Robinson grew as an author in later books. \\"In a Dry Season\\" is my favorite of his works, and one of the best recreations of 1940s and contemporary Yorkshire in print.	2003-08-01

Not too different from our world, eh? <br />What is refreshing about this book is that, unlike most other science fiction writers (and today's newspapers, radio, and government spokesmen!), Cherry does NOT gives us a simplistic view of right/wrong, good/bad, but makes the clear the economic and ideological forces that put whole peoples into opposition. The opening scenes of this book are unforgettable, with panicked civilians driven to riot, violence, and murder. And yet even the most villainous characters are not irrational and clearly have reasons for what they are doing. <br />I found this a fascinating book, with an intelligently thought out political and economic system. I only wish Cherryh could so clearly explain why WE continue to have violence and riots in OUR world.	2003-06-28

In addition to presenting an adventure with a mysterious twist, Preston and Child do what they do best--take interesting modern discoveries in science and make them the cornerstone of their adventure. I remember reading just a few years ago a controversial article that posited cannibalism by ancient peoples by the condition of excavated human bones (burnished on the ends by &quot;pot polish&quot;), and darn if that article doesn't fuel one of the twists in this book! <br />It really is a pleasure to see how these writers come up with wild and innovative ideas that are grounded in science. What fun! I can also recommend another of their books starring Smithback and Nora--&quot;Cabinet of Curiosities&quot;--for another fun read.	2003-06-04

The premise behind the book is ingenious--an ancient plague is unleashed and scientists believe the clue to the cure lies in cloning people who were alive 2000 years ago during the time of the original plague.<br />A clever idea, but this book turned out to be much more than a simple disaster tale. Underlaying the simple plot is an appreciation for beauty and a sense of wonder that adds immensely to the depth and strength of the book. The images of a decimated world are strange and beautiful. And the descriptions of the high Himalayas are stunning. Even the depiction of the plague victims embues them with a strange dignity and beauty. <br />However, despite the interesting premise of the novel, I would say it spends less time on science than on the mysteries of human relationships and their power. If you look too closely at the science behind the novel, you may not care for this book. (Humans cloned from crucifixion fragments from Golgotha retain their memory!? Huh?) My advice is to suspend critical thought and enjoy the considerable pleasures of this book by accepting it for what it is--a heart-felt look at why we love and how we live with honor. I found this book entirely captivating, and several weeks after reading it I'm still pondering it.<br />I will be looking for other books by this author!	2003-05-07

Various checkpoints allow you to verify that you are on the right track. The lessons are very clear and easy to follow, and I appreciate the continuity in presenting an entire project throughout the book, so that I feel I am really accomplishing something. After just a few lessons, I feel that I am grasping what After Effects is all about.<br />In general, these series of books are a great way to get hands-on experience with highly technical products, and I recommend them enthusiastically.	2003-04-15

The pacing is great and the thought they put into how to approach the diabolically clever puzzle of the treasure pit is impressive.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book right to the end, even sneaking out to sit in my car at work to finish it!  <br />In the first few pages of the book, we are introduced to the main character, Malin Hatch, as a boy, and see the gruesome tragedy that shadows the rest of his life, but that will not be fully explained until the end of the book. Then we skip forward 30 years. Ladies and gentlemen, THAT's what I call a &quot;hook!&quot; I was certainly hooked until the very end.<br />I'm certain you will enjoy this roller coaster ride of a book.	2003-02-04

That's the word that sprung to mind while reading this book. The world view and characters in this book really are very dark, and I found it a bit hard to read. Rankin's main character, Rebus, is about the unhappiest protagonist I've run across in mystery fiction. <br />By a strange coincidence, I happen to also be reading books by Peter Robinson, whose main character, Alan Banks is ALSO going through marital problems and career burnout. And yet somehow Banks is appealing, while Rebus is not.<br />I believe I would have rated Rankin's book higher, as it is a competent police procedural, if it weren't for the fact that it suffers in comparison to the Robinson books, which in so many ways are similar yet pull off the whole \\"world weary, burned out cop\\" thing so much better.	2003-01-29

I enjoy cooking, and I follow recipes well, although not everything I cook turns out perfectly. I have a repertoire of recipes that my family likes. So, people think I'm a decent cook.<br />But, this book made me see cooking in an entirely new way! By learning the basics of HOW to cook, this book taught me that recipes are merely a starting place. I now have the confidence to adapt and improvise, and I'm starting to think I may end up an excellent cook, not just a decent one!<br />Here's an example of how comprehensive this book is. The appetizer chapter contains over 40 recipes of foods as simple as \\"Real Buttered Popcorn\\" to as elegant as \\"Plum Tomato Tart with Pesto.\\" AND, as a bonus, includes a section titled \\"23 Other Dishes You can Serve as Sit-Down Appetizers\\" and \\"19 Other Ideas for Finger Foods,\\" referencing other recipes in the book. I mean, how much better can you get than THAT!? Along with the recipes are lots of tips and hints for variations. For example, the simple recipe for \\"Deviled (Stuffed) Eggs\\" also includes: \\"Anchovied Eggs,\\" \\"Herb-Stuffed Eggs,\\" and \\"Eggs Stuffed with Spinach.\\"<br />This would be an excellent gift for anyone who wants to become a better cook as well as someone who is just beginning to cook. I think anyone would be delighted to receive it.	2003-01-24

McDonald books starring Travis McGee, let me introduce you to Tres Navarre! The hero of Riordan's first book in the series, Tres reminds me of a young Trav McGee. He has a bit of dark edge to his character (he's lived a lot!), and his smart mouth gets him into trouble, but he's a decent, intelligent man who wants to find the truth and protect the innocent. In that way, he also reminds me of Dave Robichaux in the James Lee Burke Novels. Like McDonald and Burke, Riordan does a great job at presenting a particular culture and location, in this case San Antonio, Texas, and in developing very three-dimensional characters. I can highly recommend this book.<br />In this debut novel, Tres returns to San Antonio after having fled ten years previously after the murder of his father. He returns to wrestle with his past and to find the truth behind his father's death. In the process, he uncovers a conspiracy that involves families he's known all his life, forcing him to weigh love, loyalty, and compassion against the truth.	2003-01-20

Unfortunately, I found that I relied on the other book quite a bit more because &quot;147 Fun Things to Do in San Antonio&quot; wasn't quite up to date and didn't contain enough information to stand alone as a guide. Also, the maps were not detailed enough to find things. Frankly, it did not contain any info that was not in the more complete guide and therefore was not of much use. I'm guessing that if you were already familiar with San Antonio, this slim volume might be fine as a reminder of what attractions are available, but don't try to use it as your primary guide if you are a visitor.	2002-12-31

I couldn't put this book down from the first page. Fair warning, however: there isn't a great deal of mystery here. You figure out what's going on pretty soon. However, like the best novels of Barbara Vine (Ruth Rendell), this book is not so much about what happened as it is about the characters. Peter Robinson absolutely shines at creating characters that you really care about. It is the unfolding of these characters and the vivid representation of Yorkshire in the 1940s that make this book one of the most interesting I have read in recent years. I highly recommend this book, and can't wait to read his others.	2002-12-31

I can't recommend it too highly!<br />I've read most of Koontz's books and, while he is a great writer, most of them are simple chase thrillers that are entertaining enough, but without much substance. After reading one of these (especially the ones that are high on the \\"gross-out\\" factor), I feel just as I do after eating cotton candy--although superficially tasty, it has no nutritional value, leaving me feeling a little queasy.<br />But then there are his other books! More and more, his books are starting to have heart and substance, with characters that you honestly care about. I first saw this in \\"Watchers,\\" and more recently in \\"Tick Tock\\" and \\"Fear Nothing\\" followed by \\"Sieze the Night.\\" And now with \\"One Door Away from Heaven,\\" he has achieved a masterpiece! From the first page, he captured me with his vibrant, funny, complex characters. Instead of presenting just one intelligent, appealing character, he presents us with an entire group of fascinating, memorable characters that come alive in these pages! Although damaged by life, they are good at heart, striving to put their lives back together. <br />Without giving any spoilers away, I will say that one of the characters is not at all what he/she appears to be; even though Koontz gives plenty of clues, I laughed aloud in admiration at his artistry when I finally figured out who/what this character is. <br />Without being heavy handed, this book deals with the purpose of life and how love and caring bind us together in our fight against evil. Despite the evil villains in this book, and the trials our heroes go through, there is essentially a hopefullness, a spirituality, and a sense of wonder running through this book that left me feeling touched in a very fundamental way. Each of the heroes in the book independently ponders how \\"meeting a special person can instantly turn your life around for the better,\\" and that's how I feel after encountering this book. I can only award this book my highest praise--this is exactly the book that I would wish to write myself if I only had the talent!	2002-12-31

Because they are coated in plastic and fold, they stand up well to being stuffed in a backpack or handbag, and they are clear and easy to use. I've used the San Francisco, Manhattan, London, and Florence maps, and they are really marvelous. And now I'm going to San Antonio!<br />One of the things I like best about them is that they clearly highlight museums, parks, and other tourist spots so that they are easy to find. The only drawback is that some of the text is mighty small, which can be a problem in low light if your eyes are over 40 like mine are. They are smaller than big fold-out paper maps, which is an advantage if, for safety reasons, you don't want to make it obvious that you are studying a map, advertising that you are a visitor.	2002-12-04

Todd portrays so well the shocking dissonance between the England of pre-World War I, of laughing girls in white dresses with silk sashes playing lawn tennis, and the world of gaunt, haunted veterans who returned from the war shell-shocked and touched by death. His main character is such a veteran, and it is the story of how he tries to fit back into his pre-war life that is the point of these books rather than the actual mystery he is trying to solve. So, if you are more interested in characters than the mechanics of the plot, you are going to love this series!	2002-11-07

Fun, fun, fun, like a good gossip with a girlfriend, but by no means uplifting or spiritually illuminating. But, hey, sometimes girls just want to have fun!

In fact, I've bought several hardback copies as one after the other wore out from being dragged to the beach or on vacation. <br />So, you can imagine how delighted I was when I saw a sequel was coming out. I saved reading the hardback until I had a long weekend, savoring the anticipation. And I must say that I did enjoy the book. And yet, and yet... <br />To enjoy this book you must have patience. Be ready for a leisurely stroll. I think the fact that I read the Talisman first means that I was more patient with Black House because I knew something good was coming and I didn't mind looking out the window and enjoying the scenery on the way. If you can enjoy the character development and description without being irritated that the plot doesn't move along very quickly, I think you will like this book. Straub and King are a great team, and the characters in this book are among the most vivid and well drawn of any I've read.	2002-08-29

Some readers found this book to be boring. I thought it was one of the most interesting books I've read in years! I loved it and have read it several times. The characters are brilliant, and I find Jane Smiley's mixture of semi-documentary tone and whimsey charming and appealing. I know nothing about horses, but her glimpses into the moods and thoughts of the thoroughbred horses SEEM spot on, and give this book an irrestible appeal. (To the reviewers who were upset at the ommissions in the audio CD, I'd say this: DON'T BUY ABRIDGED AUDIO VERSIONS! By definition, something will be left out. I enjoyed the book so much that I bought an UNABRIDGED audio version for trips, and \\"JustaBob\\" was there!)	2002-08-27
US	52922196	RQGL9RAGUB0AA	034542252X	472208605	Rose	Books	5	13	15	N	N	Mystery Upon Mystery! Delectable!	This is a delectable book. I use that word deliberately. The richness of the prose and character development lead you to savor the writing slowly as if tasting it on your tongue. The protagonist, Mr. Blair, is the most interesting character I've encountered in years! Some readers don't care for the slow pace of this book, but this book is all about building characters and place, and less about fast-paced plot.<br />I first read this book several years ago and kept it for a re-reading after enough time had passed that I had forgotten the details. I'm 3/4 of the way through for the second time, and I remember that something surprising and amazing is coming, but I don't remember what!<br />Meanwhile, I'm loving this mystery upon a mystery. What is the secret of the mysterious, vulnerable, and somehow likeable (in spite of or because of his rough edges?) Mr. Blair? What is the secret behind the disappearance of the respectable Curate Maypole? Does the apathy of the town concerning the disappearance of Maypole point to a town-wide conspiracy? What is behind the Bishop's investigation? It's clear he has a hidden agenda and means our Mr. Blair no good! And what is the secret of the two women in the story? Charlotte, Maypole's fiance is angry, cold, and strangely antagonistic to her father the Bishop (she compares him to Saturn, who ate his children). And Rose--who works in the mine, flaunting her rebellion against Victorian England's rigid guidelines on what is respectable work for a young woman--why does she have books in her strangely comfortable home, when the rest of the mine workers live in hovels and can barely read? All of these opposing threads are beginning to be pulled together. Can they all have something to do with Maypole's Home for Women Who Have Fallen for the First Time? (I'm not kidding about that name.) I can hardly wait to find out (or re-remember from my first reading).<br />This book is really worth your time. I'd love to see a sequel.	2002-08-26
US	52922196	RFVUWVQ2Y7YGZ	0345359828	435360868	The Last Ship	Books	4	19	27	N	Y	Beautifully written book, BUT...	My original review was written when I had read about 2/3 of the book. At that time I gave it 5 stars and roundly chewed out the reviewers who said it was \\"dry\\" or not written well. <br />Well, now that I've finished, I have a slightly different view. I still think it is beautifully written. And I still think that readers who love language and appreciate complex writing will enjoy it. (And for those who thought it was poorly written, consider your reading skills as the source of the problem.) <br />However, the ending did not live up to the book's earlier promise. After hundreds of pages that kept me on the edge of my seat, filled with incredible sights and events, the ending simply limped along in a disappointing way. And, although I'm no prude, an extremly crude sex scene toward the end of the book turned me off and made the narrator of the book much less appealing as a character, somewhat tainting the rest of the book for me. (It wasn't so much that the sex scene was crude, but what it said about the character's emotional immaturity that disturbed me.)	2002-05-17
US	52922196	RNI5XV42UK3GD	0312866097	561606943	Icehenge	Books	3	10	12	N	Y	A good appetizer for the Mars Trilogy	If I hadn't already read KSR's Mars Trilogy, I'm not sure I would have liked this book much. This book was written 10 years before Red Mars/Green Mars/Blue Mars were published, but KSR obviously had already thought through a number of the terraforming and long life issues he would deal with in those books. For that reason alone, this book is extremely interesting as a precursor to the trilogy (although it actually is set in a future time when Mars has an established atmosphere and settled government).<br />However, there was a darkness to this book that disturbed me. The main character in the middle section constantly struggles to avoid falling into a deep, immobilizing depression. There is little joy in this book, and overmuch political machinations, hopelessness and depression.	2002-03-26

I love cookbooks, and read them like novels. (After all, if you're always dieting, curling up with good cookbook gives some of the pleasure of eating a good meal, but with no calories!) <br />I have several hundred cookbooks, but how many do I really use when I cook? Well, this one, definitely. If you are looking for simple, quick, low fat recipes, I can't recommend this book too highly. When I'm stuck for a quick dinner, this cookbook is where I look first. The recipes are very quick and they mostly use common ingredients you can quickly pick up at the grocery store or might have on your pantry shelves already.<br />By the way, in addition to listing nutrtional info for each recipe, each recipe also gives Weight Watchers points (if you are a Weight Watcher, you know what I mean), and diabetic exchanges. So, I think this would also be a great cookbook for diabetics as well as those of us who are trying to lose weight.	2002-01-02

This one, however, is more fun than you'd imagine it could be. Every section has basic dialogs, but also has games, songs, and fun things to listen to on the CD/cassettes. There is even an on-going novella throughout the book. In addition, there are interesting little tidbits on Italian culture, proverbs, and tips on traveling in Italy. In other words, each section has lots of activities and variety. On the whole, the most fun you can have while still learning!	2001-03-14
US	52922196	R8ZDZESKBSXKZ	0671046179	815342548	Blood And Smoke Cd	Books	2	3	6	N	Y	No fire behind this smoke...	I love Stephen King. I've watched with the pleasure of a fond Aunt as his work continued to grow and expand. After the wonderful experience of listening to the CDs of &quot;Bag of Bones,&quot; I could hardly wait to get &quot;Blood and Smoke.&quot; What a disappointment. Whereas in &quot;Bag of Bones,&quot; we are immediately captured by a decent, caring, complex main character whose musings on literature and humanity are insightful and rich, in &quot;Blood and Smoke&quot; we are exposed to definitely second-rate stories that have only a 10th of the interest and complexity of &quot;Bag of Bones.&quot; I could hardly bring myself to care about the main characters at all. Even Mr. King's reading voice was a disappointment. In &quot;Bag of Bones,&quot; his flat, Maine twang fits the story to a &quot;T,&quot; and impresses the reader with his ability to infuse his reading with subtle shifts in intonation for the different characters (I found myself thinking, &quot;Hey, this guy's a darn good actor!&quot;). In &quot;Blood and Smoke,&quot; his reading was much less polished and, frankly, I thought he didn't even sound too interested in the stories.<br />'Fess up, Mr. King! This is a joke, right? You just wanted to see if we were watching. These stories have all the hallmarks of being written 10 years ago before your style grow out of &quot;horror book shlock&quot; and into literature. (Hmmm. Interesting that a theme in &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; is popular authors' device of keeping a flow of books coming onto the market by publishing old manuscripts stored away years ago for a future need... You shouldn't have told us about that trick.)	2000-10-14

I was looking for an introduction to digital video that would explain basic concepts without assuming an engineering background. In other words, I wanted to know what composite video is and how color is encoded in the  video signal, but without timing diagrams and math. This is not that book.  It might be an &quot;introduction&quot; for a video engineer, but not for a  standard computer user. Had to return it.	2000-05-02

The biggest benefit this book gave me was a reasonable, sensible goal. Without some kind of measurable goal (in this case, meeting the minimum number of exercise points per week), you have nothing to measure yourself  against and I always felt I wasn't doing enough! Now, when I've done my  exercise for the week and I don't feel like getting up on Saturday morning,  I just crawl back into bed! And it's working! Without changing my diet I've  lost 10 pounds over the last month, just by using my stationary bicycle,  hiking, and exercise videos.	2000-03-02

I am devastated that it is out of print--I was hoping to buy a replacement copy for my paperback that is falling apart from multiple re-readings. One of my favorite books.	1998-06-19

I borrowed this book from the library when I was 8 years old and loved reading it! I've been looking for it for almost 40 years, and I'm delighted to have found it again. Imagine 40 years of walking into book stores and saying &quot;Um, well, I don't remember who wrote it, but do you have any children's books about a &quot;mushroom planet?&quot; 40 years of blank stares! I KNEW I hadn't imagined this book! I've ordered it and can hardly wait to read it again.	1998-04-17
