This is his story. One more in the long line of wrestler 'autobiographies' that are perpetually filling the market based on the success of Mick Foley's own story. Some of them a very good, others are very bad. This one leans more to the good side.<br /><br />Regal comes from a small town in England and is introduced to wrestling by his grandfather William. Regal begins his wrestling career at age 16 and spends his early years travelling the United Kingdom for the few promoters there. He fills in some quaint stories of his past and his comrades that he gets on with. He expands into the European market and does some local shows for then WWF and WCW when they went to England.<br /><br />He spends a good portion of the book covering his addiction to painkillers, alcohol, and enhancers but only briefly mentions use of cocaine. You must applaud his wife for sticking with him with the hell he puts forth in the way he treated people during this time. He briefly covers the forced landing of an airplane due in part to his drunkness. He mentions he was not the only problem on the plane but is also very careful throughout the book to not degrade any other personalities or throw out dirt stories on his colleagues.<br /><br />The book then moves on to his arrival into American wrestling with WCW and later the WWF/E. Surprisingly, he spends very little time rehashing matches and storylines once he hits the \\"bigtime\\". He throws in some anecdotes regarding Ric Flair, Paul \\"Triple H\\" Levesque, Fit Finlay, Goldberg, and others. It's almost missing something because he mentions his favorite match he ever had (vs Edge) but doesn't go into why it's his favorite.<br /><br />All in all, the book is solid but not outstanding. He does get personal in his drug use and rehab. Regal throws in his English verbage/syntax to help add flavor and personalize the story (he includes a glossary for the terms also). He also tries to establish that there is a serious difference between him as Darren Matthews and his character persona of the snooty blue-blooded Steven William Regal (much the same as Missy Hyatt/Melissa Hiat did in her book). The biggest annoyance of the book is the quote blurbs that fill multiple pages or parts of pages (they are backgrounded by a Union Jack). I've always taken quote blurbs to be a spot where an important point is being made, but these just seem to be random picks to be offset for no apparent reason.<br /><br />It's certainly not the best 'autobiography' by a wrestler, but there are certainly worse ones. Either way, it's a fast read and much less costly than some of the other wrestler's books (I think I bought mine new for $16 at Barnes & Noble)terms also).

However, as movie companies shy away from oversaturated sequels, Jason takes to the books. We dealt with the Jason X books which were rather weak. Here we have a closer essence to what Friday the 13th and Jason Voorhees is about. With some of the sequels we dealt with, this could easily be adapted to a screenplay and movie.<br /><br />Unlike others, I placed this book to take place after Part 8 (Manhattan). Church cult leader Father Eric Long has indoctorined that Jason is the right hand of God and is His instrument in judging the righteous over the sinners. Long and his lackey Curtis Rickles manage to discover Jason's body submerged in Crystal Lake. Long has taken the lease over on Camp Crystal Lake and moves his congregation of the Church of the Heavenly Vessel along with the crucified corpse of Jason he now displays to his followers.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a gov't group known only as The Agency has sent a batch of soldiers into the area to capture Jason Voorhees, not knowing that the Church is at Crystal Lake now but still thinking Jason is up and mobile. Elsewhere, Long & co-horts manage to revive Jason who immediately begins doling out 'judgement'. So begins the rise of Jason and his death toll.<br /><br />The reason I place this after Part 8 is that it can be the first attempt by the Agency to secure Jason, and Part 9 (Jason Goes to Hell) begins with an agency SWAT team actually taking him out before going into the rebirth storyline. I feel it fits better here than it does for coming between parts 7&8.<br /><br />For fans of the series, this is a fun book that reads as one of the movies. I would have liked a different ending to stop Jason but hey, it works but will make it hard for the next writer to bring him back. None-the-less, you get the feeling and flavor of a Jason slaughter in this gorefest. I've stated in other reviews, there are times I just want to read a book, not for plot but for sheer enjoyment, and being a fan of the F13 franchise, this book is great brain-jelly for the fan because we probably won't see another Jason movie anytime soon.e are times I just want to read a book, not for plot but for sheer enjoyment, and being a fan of the F13 franchise, this book is great brain-jelly for the fan because we probably won't see another Jason movie anytime soon.	2005-10-07

This book is a nicely done translation to written words although the writing style is a little screenwriter-ish rather than a book author. It's a fast read and will be enjoyed by fans of Predator. Your dealing with Dutch's (Schwarzenegger) brother in his job as a police detective. As another reviewer pointed out, this is what Predator 2 was supposed to be. Drug war, predators, and Dutch with the police. Could easily be translated into Predator 3 for a blow 'em up action movie, probably starring Dolph Lundgren as Schaefer (yeah I know Dolph's acting is less than stellar but so is Arnie's). The book itself, if you're a fan, you'll love it; if your not, you should still enjoy it but keep in mind it is an action book with no plot.	2005-10-06

Before the AvP movie, there was the Alien/Predator crossover found in comics by Dark Horse and then brought to paperback form by Steve Perry. All the books in this series takes place in the future while humans are settling on new planets. Here we have Machiko Noguchi conducting her business on a hot wasteland world for the Coporation. Predators, the species called yuatja, have begun seeding the planet with alien eggs so they may perform a Hunt. The Hunt is a right of passage for young yuatja to join the warrior caste. Sure enough, the humans on the planet are caught in the middle when the facehuggers begin using their \\"cattle\\" beasts as hosts. During the Hunt, and older predator/yuatja is injured, found, and brought back to the settlement. This sets up the alliance formed by Broken Tusk (the predator) and Noguchi.<br /><br />This book is the beginning of a fun series. We get to see into the predators' background and society in a way that doesn't make them look evil and nasty like the movies. They are honor-bound but still a warrior based society. We are further satitsfied by being able to learn various words of the yuatja language without going all Klingon-geekfest on it (no offense meant to those Trek fans out there reading this). It's a well done book and a great adventure that goes deeper than the comics. You can also pick up traces of the story that influenced the writing for the movie AvP set in modern day. Noguchi and Lex (from the movie) are very similar characters in these circumstances. Well done and the other books are just as enjoyable.	2005-10-04

The dark, twisted, neon lit streets that lead to darker places where John Taylor runs his private eye office. Taylor finds things but to use his third eye, his private eye, allows his enemies to track him down. Taylor is looking to get to his quest of saving the Nightside from the apocalyptic future he witnessed in a timeslip that frequents the Nightside. First he must deal with client Eamonn Mitchell who wandered into the Nightside by accident. Dealing with multiple alternate versions of himself, Eamonn seeks Taylor.<br /><br />After finishing with Eamonn, Taylor takes up with bounty hunter Shotgun Suzie and Tommy Oblivion (another private eye). Tommy's gift is the existential logic that he uses to talk people into things. They meet up with the entity Old Father Time to travel back through time to the creation of the Nightside, born of Lilith - Taylor's mother and Adam's first wife. Through the trip we receive the secret of Merlin's stolen heart, the birth of Lamentation, history on Strangefellows & the Londinium Club, piss off Poseidenis, meet some angels, and join Herne the Hunter for his favorite pasttime (my favorite part of this book).<br /><br />This addition to the Nightside books starts a little slow but picks up towards the end. If you haven't read the other books, you might get lost with a number of the characters that made appearances in those books. None-the-less, you can read it without the others. This is the dark entry that deals with character development of Taylor and Shotgun Suzie and sets up the future battles in the next book(s). The entity characters are always great in these books and Taylor's abilities continue to make you enjoy his character. Paths Not Taken is a welcome addition to the series and hopefully we will get more of the same.	2005-10-04

This time we run afoul of fake trophy deer mounts, exotic animal hunting, the chupacabra, tabloid tv reporters, deaths by screwdrivers & toasters, Chinese midget porn, and our favorite redneck poachers-come-heroes Red Obrien and Billy Don Craddock.<br /><br />Rehder continues to put forth enjoyable comic mysteries based in his fictional Blanco County. His witty writing and quick pace takes the readers through a speedy jaunt in the back country via a variety of interesting characters. Just when you begin to wonder why one of the side stories is even in the book, it all falls into place and ties it all together.

I fall into the former. We are introduced to a wide variety of characters throughout the book, all of them chasing a missing suitcase containing five million dollars and it happens to be in the trunk of a car belonging to two unwittingly involved vacationers. You get possibly the worst drug cartel in the world, Ernest Hemmingway look-a-likes, and most importantly the Florida history/trivia buff and psychopath Serge Storms with sidekick Coleman. There is a large variety of violence contained in this book so it may not prove to everyone's liking. As the chase continues we come across death by Levi's, barbie doll, drawbridge, and space shuttle launch to name a few. There are many side stories going on that all draw together towards the end. It's wacky and a bit sick. It's a matter of whether you will like it or hate it, your stomach will decide.	2005-09-26

By no means are these great books, but the are a splendid and enjoyable relaxing read. Moore goes into slightly warped versions of a number of fairy tales including Frog Prince, Rapunzel, and Rumplestilskin for this outing.<br /><br />There is something to be said about methodical frog-kissing, violations of the Frog-to-Prince clauses, the proper way of who loves whom, and spinning wheel toting Jewish dwarves.<br /><br />Overall, through the twists and lighthearted writing method of Moore, you come down with an enjoyable and fun trip through the lunacy of fairy tales. Along with Moore's book \\"Heroics for Beginners\\" he is establishing himself as a comedic fantasy author. Hopefully Moore will develop a larger following and continue to put forth some more twisted fairy tales. I also hope he will avoid the Piers Anthony fall into insipid tripe that the once enjoyable Xanth novels have become.	2005-09-26

The \\"Best of Sasquatch\\" is the reprinting of Green's early books, \\"On the Track of...\\" and \\"Encounters with...\\" bigfoot/sasquatch. There is also an 'update' segment in the book to help bring it up to speed.<br /><br />It's great to see the books reprinted and the cover art for the book is well done. The update section is all too brief and Green spends little time or page space to give any really gripping information or update material, but this is standard with both of the books republished here also. Keep in mind, Green is a newspaperman by choice and trade, he's a 'bigfoot researcher' in his spare time. The books of course cover the classic stories of Ostman, Baumann, Ape Canyon, Patterson film, William Roe, and the Chapman's Ruby Creek. These are found in nearly all the books on the subject. The important thing here is that these are among the first real bigfoot/sasquatch based books sent into circulation so is actually some of the earliest printed tellings of the stories. Throughout the rest of the books are very brief encounters, incidents, sightings, etc.. that are convoluted and crammed together with little sense of flow or smoothness. It's like reading a newspaper that has a certain amount of space to stuff in as much info as they possibly can.<br /><br />The books are very quick reads and give a wide range of compacted stories. As for people calling John Green the authority on bigfoot research... collecting newspaper stories and dropping some money to go look at old tracks does not an expert make (but then what is a \\"bigfoot expert\\" anyway). Green has simply collected a massive amount of stories from a variety of sources, compiled them into his \\"computerized database\\", and then dropped enough of them together to form a few books. He offers no real theories on the creatures or makes any serious speculations, he's simply a newspaper guy that rounded up his favorite stories and put them into an order to form a book.<br /><br />But I digress... overall, very well done for being on the forefront of sasquatch material, it gave people a large scope on the range and variety of sightings/encounters. These books have probably been the most influential in the various books that have been published since. Green's best work is \\"Sasquatch, the Apes Among Us\\" but this book is still absolutely necessary for any bigfoot collection.tions, he's simply a newspaper guy that rounded up his favorite stories and put them into an order to form a book. <br /> <br />But I digress... overall, very well done for being on the forefront of sasquatch material, it gave people a large scope on the range and variety of sightings/encounters.

Her pick is Walter Sickert, an artist/actor that had an alleged penile deformity. By page six, Cornwell is saying Sickert is the Ripper, by page ten she full out states he is. Good for her but after reading the book, I'm not in the slightest convinced it was Sickert. It seems that her interest was raised when she was in London and was on a tour when D.A.C. John Grieve tells her to check out an interesting chap named Walter Sickert. In the paragraphs prior to this (pg 10) she admits having never read anything on the Ripper, known about his crimes & victims, or anything about him yet she can state she is 100% certain Sickert is Jack the Ripper now. Had Mr. Grieve not mentioned Sickert, would she have ever have heard of him?<br /><br />It looks as though Ms Cornwell was given a suspect and then at her own expense made the suspect fit the crime. She does this by forcing herself to read more into his dreary paintings and drawings than is really there. The samples she uses for comparison of Sickert's doodles and alleged Ripper doodles bear little resemblance to each other. Her mtDNA tests are weak to the point of being useless and that's not counting the viable contaminants of over a 100 years. Cornwell won't accept that any of the alleged Ripper letters sent to Scotland Yard or London Police were faked by others. Then there's a repeated argument of hers is that while someone couldn't prove Sickert was there/doing this, no one can prove he wasn't there/doing that. Pretty shoddy \\"evidence\\" if you ask me. She does a nice job on descriptions on 1880s life but she got sidetracked an awful lot with seemingly unimportant items/people. She does virtually nothing to eliminate other prime suspects (not even touching on a few of the more serious contenders) as she convinced herself Sickert was the man. Rather than look at the evidence and suspects and slowly eliminating them, she seems to do her research backwards, starting at the end and making the evidence come to that conclusion. She then tries to attribute murders after the Ripper 'disappeared' to the Ripper/Sickert saying that he decided to up his ante and began mutilating and now dismembering the victims even more than before, but he just quit sending letters to the police.<br /><br />This is a point of history where there is a 99.9% chance that we will never know who Jack the Ripper was. Cornwell's synopsis and jumpy timelines do little to 'close the case' by pointing at Sickert. I'd sooner believe that it may have been the William Stewart proposed \\"Jill the Ripper\\" before I would put my wager on Sickert.<br /><br />All in all, it's worth the read to anyone interested in studying Jack the Ripper, but Cornwell's evidence is so forced and stretched beyond reasoning. Again, she seemed to be given a suspect and using a literary prybar, tried to make him fit into the conformity of Jack the Ripper. But then if I had spent an alleged $6 million dollars of my own money, I'd be pretty conviced too.rch backwards, starting at the end and making the evidence come to that conclusion.

This book is divided into two parts. The first 2/3 of the book is a reprint of Roger Patterson's \\"Do Abominable Snowmen of America Really Exist?\\". The deceased Patterson's book is a collection of newspaper and magazine stories with his thoughts interjected in them. The clippings tend to get redundant, often copying each other and there are multiple articles from Ivan Sanderson used therein. Patterson was also able to show off his own art skills with a multitude of his own interpretive drawings based on witness testimony along with hand drawn maps of areas, all are well done.<br /><br />The last 1/3 of the book can be broken in half also. The first being a reprint of a number of 'authorities' giving their views on whether the P-G Bigfoot film is real or a hoax (coincidentally all in favor). The second part of this section is Murphy's rebuttal to Greg Long's book \\"The Making of Bigfoot\\" claiming Bob Heironimus was 'the man in the suit'. Murphy gives brief counter-arguments to many of Long's 'evidence of hoaxing', many of which have been discussed in reviews of Long's book on Amazon.com. Interesting that Long refused permission for Murphy to reprint an 'evidence picture' of Bob Heironimus doing the bigfoot walk and also Phillip Morris (claims to have sold Patterson one of his movie gorilla suits) refused to let Murphy print any pictures of one of his gorilla suits which Morris claims he can identify in the P-G footage.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good book because you get Patterson's book which was first printed before he even shot the P-G bigfoot film. The affirming letters from 'experts' are collected into one stockpile and Murphy's counter-arguments are well done albeit brief in content.<br /><br />The only problem I have with this book and Murphy's other book \\"Meet the Sasquatch\\" is that in 1999, Chris Murphy and Cliff Crook were doing the same 'debunking' of the film claiming to have found a \\"bell shaped object\\" resembling a zipper dangling from the waist in blown-up stills from the film (google it, you'll see). Murphy seems to be firm in his resolve on the bigfoot issue now but a meer six years ago he was disclaiming it? Is this a matter of just easily cashing in on a popular subject matter or is he truly a believer? Tough for me to decide but you be the judge for yourself.found a \\"bell shaped object\\" resembling a zipper dangling from the waist in blown-up stills from the film (google it, you'll see).

Given that former leadman John Green is getting on in years, Steenburg takes the reigns nicely and gives a steady stream of incidents taking place in British Columbia and Alberta. The upside of the book is that Steenburg sticks with Canada, his home and covers the area well. The downfall is, he uses the formula interview questions on every interview and some of the questions tend to be leading. After repeatedly reading the same questions, you become a little bored but at least he's asking the same questions of everyone.<br /><br />The stories are varied and he does a good job with the questioning but I still find it hard to believe people can pick out certain details on someone/thing at a distance of 1/2 a mile. I've tested this, you really don't get much facial or miniscule detail on a person standing over a 100 yards away and that's stretching it. General looks yes but details by the naked eye just isn't all the feasible.<br /><br />The most intriguing story of the book is the Crandell (sp?) Campground incident and will probably become a regular story in future books on bigfoot/sasquatch. The overall flow of the book is easy to read and you get some much lesser known encounters by regular people all over western Canada. Combined with his other book \\"Sasquatch:Bigfoot, the Continuing Mystery\\" and Robert Alley's \\"Raincoast Sasquatch\\" you get a very good coverage of all of BC and Alberta.	2005-09-09

I've moved into reading the new Jason X books. First one was direct from the movie and well done. The second one lagged and failed to focus on Jason so fell short of expectations (limited as they were, it is afterall a slasher book). This third one was so dismal it should be discontinued immediately.<br /><br />First the \\"Planet of the Beast\\" takes place around the conveniently named Planet #666 which just happens to be the order in which humans discovered it in their search of planets; this in itself is utterly moronic. Second, \\"Jason X\\" is the name of the movie not the character however the author seems to insist that's the killer's name now. The mass of inconsistiencies shows the author did no research or possibly never even seen the Jason X movie. She repeatedly comments on Jason's pale cold blue eyes. Did she not even look at the cover photo for her book? Did anyone in editing not see the movie? Jason's eyes, after being transformed are a burning reddish orange, certainly not blue. The author writes about Jason's mouth which is non existant from the new mask. Most damaging (other than the eyes which bothered the crap out of me) is the repetitive statements regarding Jason's extremely fast speed. What??? Jason has never moved fast and even basing it off the Jason X movie, he moved no faster after transformation. Fourth, as another reviewer stated, Jason was a killer not a torturer. The mass amount of dismemberment was boring and nonsensical and was there for the 'gore purpose' only and it falls completely short of that, again hinging on moronic. The author didn't even attempt to explain how Jason revives on Planet #666.<br /><br />For all my ranting, here is the summation of my view... in short, this book seemed to have been written by a 12-year old and is just simply abysmal. The author didn't care about the book or subject matter, the author had no clue about the subject matter, and the editing was terrible (just the amount of typoes and grammar was disgraceful for any book). I don't expect much from a book based on \\"Friday the 13th\\" but I do expect the author to show some ingenuity and/or reasoning in their work.<br /><br />Even as a fan, you shouldn't read this book.

That's why it got 2 stars instead of 1. What detracts from the book is nearly everything else. The characters, Conrad, Serghetti, and Yeats are weak, one dimensional, and pathetic. They are either so over the top (Yeats), completely whiny and asinine (Conrad), or ridiculously obtuse (Serghetti) that you have no feeling for them. The background characters are even worse with the bad guy Egyptian Zawas, Admiral Watson (?), and the Pope. Let's not forget the introduction of countless characters that served no purpose other than to fill a line on them dying.<br /><br />So much about this book was flimsy in its story and credibility ranging from on the spot stellar cartography to military inaccuracies to global destruction based on a crust shift. It's almost like the author watched 'Independence Day' and thought that's how you write a story. It's not a novel so much as a weak screenplay for a flash-bang special effects laden movie that would pull mindless masses into watching it (like 'The Day After Tomorrow').<br /><br />If you can find it at a used bookstore for a buck, it's worth the money. Buy it new for the $8 most stores charge, you're wasting your money. Potential for a good story but all the negatives destroy this by the time your a third of the way through the book.	2005-08-18

This is his story. One more in the long line of wrestler 'autobiographies' that are perpetually filling the market based on the success of Mick Foley's own story. Some of them a very good, others are very bad. This one leans more to the good side.<br /><br />Regal comes from a small town in England and is introduced to wrestling by his grandfather William. Regal begins his wrestling career at age 16 and spends his early years travelling the United Kingdom for the few promoters there. He fills in some quaint stories of his past and his comrades that he gets on with. He expands into the European market and does some local shows for then WWF and WCW when they went to England.<br /><br />He spends a good portion of the book covering his addiction to painkillers, alcohol, and enhancers but only briefly mentions use of cocaine. You must applaud his wife for sticking with him with the hell he puts forth in the way he treated people during this time. He briefly covers the forced landing of an airplane due in part to his drunkness. He mentions he was not the only problem on the plane but is also very careful throughout the book to not degrade any other personalities or throw out dirt stories on his colleagues.<br /><br />The book then moves on to his arrival into American wrestling with WCW and later the WWF/E. Surprisingly, he spends very little time rehashing matches and storylines once he hits the \\"bigtime\\". He throws in some anecdotes regarding Ric Flair, Paul \\"Triple H\\" Levesque, Fit Finlay, Goldberg, and others. It's almost missing something because he mentions his favorite match he ever had (vs Edge) but doesn't go into why it's his favorite.<br /><br />All in all, the book is solid but not outstanding. He does get personal in his drug use and rehab. Regal throws in his English verbage/syntax to help add flavor and personalize the story (he includes a glossary for the terms also). He also tries to establish that there is a serious difference between him as Darren Matthews and his character persona of the snooty blue-blooded Steven William Regal (much the same as Missy Hyatt/Melissa Hiat did in her book). The biggest annoyance of the book is the quote blurbs that fill multiple pages or parts of pages (they are backgrounded by a Union Jack). I've always taken quote blurbs to be a spot where an important point is being made, but these just seem to be random picks to be offset for no apparent reason.<br /><br />It's certainly not the best 'autobiography' by a wrestler, but there are certainly worse ones. Either way, it's a fast read and much less costly than some of the other wrestler's books (I think I bought mine new for $16 at Barnes & Noble)ms also).

US	30908564	R2QCXCM2TX119E	0425203530	831791018	Ashes	Books	2	2	3	N	N	Potential but falls down	An archeological dig in Honduras reveals an ancient Mayan burial pot that contains the remains of an evil chieftan Chac Mol and his bride Xochitl. The pot is opened and unleashes the evil spirit which begins jumping into bodies of living creatures and killing the others, leaving behind piles of ash. The spirit eventually makes its way to PA and the little town of Aronston.<br /><br />The town has its own history with its founder Aaron Moyer who was a little wacky in the noggin himself, having beaten his wife and was killed by her brothers. The spirit of Chac Mol has come to inhabit the body of Roger Phillips, descendant of the evil Aaron Moyer.<br /><br />The story then begins its journey to completion when Roger/Chac Mol/Aaron Moyer thinks that local girl Collette Walls is Xochitl. The fun then begins with mysterious fires, ash piles, and introductions of characters that have no real purpose in the story (namely the playwright, the old man, the newspaper woman, the mentally challenged Byron). Throw in the Founder's Day events which only serve to acknowledge Aaron's role in the town (why the town celebrates an despicable person was beyond me). We also have Darrin, Colette's boss with whom she's having an affair, for a love interest plot that goes nowhere. I won't reveal the ending cuz I don't enjoy spoilers either.<br /><br />All in all it had some potential but too many ingredients. The author should have run with one story or the other, either Chac Mol reincarnation or the ghost of Aaron Moyer re-establishing himself through a descendant. Both presences just convoluted the story and made it a bit sloppy.<br /><br />None-the-less, it is worth the read and as others have mentioned, it's not a waste of money to buy the book but if you can get it at the library, you'll be just as well off. With proper treatment, this could make a decent movie.	2005-08-05

It is well done and includes many gruesome pictures. He covers the rise in popularity of slasher movies in general and a synopsis of what movies were influenced by other movies and so forth. Grove gives a rundown of each of the movies but begins to slack off for the later movies as you can tell he himself didn't like them much. Grove covers the troubles of production and funding along with finding cheap actors with the small budgets of the horror film industry. He gives appreciative nods to the effects artists despite the inconsistencies of Jason's appearance through the movies. Grove provided minor background on the set locations ranged from Connecticut, New Jersey, Georgia, California, and British Columbia.<br /><br />For the early movies he gives the basic story and deaths of each of the characters with brief interview statements from a variety of the crew and cast. This I liked, however, the later movies he pretty much flies by them, not even listing all the cast as he had down previously. Even more briefly his covering of the deaths were often grouped it into the words of the hapless victims get slaughtered rather than describing the death scene as he did earlier.<br /><br />You do pick up some interesting tidbits about the various Jason actors and the ungratefulness of a couple of them. I would have like to have seen a chapter covering some behind the scenes antics from the Jasons and other cast. The last few pages of the book gives you a running body count of the movies although there are one or two discrepancies (having myself already thoroughly done the body counts while watching the movies) but it was a great additive.<br /><br />A great addition to the book would have been a thorough timeline of Friday events of the characters/stories. None-the-less, this is a great book for the fans of the series. For those complaining about it being less than they expected... well it's a book about B-grade horror movies, you shouldn't have expected a lot. The book is well worth the price and gives plenty of coverage and bit interviews.xpected... well it's a book about B-grade horror movies, you shouldn't have expected a lot.

I liked Jason X as it stuck to the movie and then added plausible backgrounds to the characters. \\"Jason X: The Experiment\\" falls far short of being a good addition to the franchise.<br /><br />The author spends the majority of the book introducing characters with backgrounds and lagging on and on with nothing very interesting happening. Sure there's a nutjob that is trying to clone Jason for a super-soldier program in the future setting on Earth II, but the characters are more annoying than anything. Now I will admit that there stands to be no chance of a plot in a series about Jason Voorhees, I'll also admit that I picked these up because every once in a while I need to read a mindless brain jelly book. I did expect more than this though.<br /><br />I feel the biggest problem in the book is that it's part of the new Jason X series but Jason is barely even in the book. His regeneration is dealt with in the beginning, he whacks a couple eco-terrorists, and then he's a statue for the majority of the book, barely getting any mention throughout the body of the book. He then finally gets some action in the last 75 pages, if that. Here we have a case of someone wanting to write a sci-fi story and is authorized to use an established copyrighted character and then the franchise player is barely used in the book.<br /><br />Plain and simple, if you're going to write a book about Jason Voorhees, you need to use him throughout the book, not as an intro piece and a poor conclusion wrap up. It's not a bad story, mind you, just a bad use of the character. To be honest, people will buy this book because we want to see Jason in slaughter mode, high body count, and inventive ways he offs his victims. I appreciate the effort, but if writing about Jason, then write about Jason not a pile of characters that serve little purpose.	2005-07-16
US	30908564	R5BC99GN3GSNS	1844161684	104250020	Jason X	Books	4	8	8	N	N	The book not the movie	Since I am a fan of the Friday the 13th movies (got them all on VHS and DVD), I of course fell into this series and dropped the cash to read them. I need the occassional escape book that is nothing but fun to read, no deep plots or twists and turns, just brain jelly for the day. This book by Pat Cadigan seems to have been written directly off the movie. A few descrepencies but it is all there in print for you. The author then adds to it by developing backgrounds on Brodski and his grunts as well as Rowan and explains just why the heck there are teenagers running around in a spaceship. She also gives some reasoning to Jason's very limited thought processes which are enough to make sense without going overboard, I mean the guy is a walking slashing zombie killing machine now so how much can be going through his brain.<br /><br />By no means is this the Great American Novel, it's not even the Good American Novel, but it is an entertaining read for those who are fans of the series. Those who aren't fans, just watch the movie, you'll get the same thing out of it in 1/4 of the time. It's an 80 minute movie versus an 8 hour read. For fans, check it out for backgrounds and then slip into the rest of the series.	2005-07-12

Here we have a book that rides the successful coattails of Mick Foley's autobiographies. Everyone is writing a book now and the market will quickly become saturated with crappy biographies from professional wrestlers. This one is borderline. It's certainly an enjoyable and very quick read and covers Hyatt's career from WCCW to UWF to WWF and WCW then ending up in ECW before calling it quits in anything 'big time'.<br /><br />She does well in filling in anecdotes on her journey through wrestling with her first contact on going downtown with Tommy \\"Wildfire\\" Rich. The stories are much more interesting than her sexual exploits which almost seems to be straight up name dropping, not sure if that's something to be proud of. We see Jake Roberts, Road Warrior Hawk (twice), John Tatum, Eddie Gilbert, Dr Tom Pritchard, Eric Watts among others like Jason Hervey and some football players (which includes a spontaneous launch involving Jim Kelly).<br /><br />The book may have been better had she left these out or went into more detail but the actual focus of the book is how this attractive young woman joins wrestling without being a wrestler herself. She makes it plain the she was a gimmick valet often used only to fend for her man from opposing valets that were popular through the 80s. She also puts forth that there is a difference between her persona of Missy Hyatt and her true self Melissa Hiatt which shows through when she talks of Eddie Gilbert's sudden death.<br /><br />She goes through the trials of working with bad relationships among fellow wrestling personas and her final destination into college to earn a degree. It's good to see there is someone that had the brains enough to know wrestling isn't a forever thing except for the few individuals that make superstardom and rake in the cash. The majority of wrestlers never see the big time or only get a fleeting glimpse of it, so it's good to see that Hiatt had the wisdom to turn a passion into a stepping stone and progress herself for life after wrestling. Afterall, do you really want to see the desirable Missy Hyatt lowered to the demeaning antics of Fabulous Moolah and Mae Young nowadays?only get a fleeting glimpse of it, so it's good to see that Hiatt had the wisdom to turn a passion into a stepping stone and progress herself for life after wrestling.

Coleman gives some extra background on a few of the classic stories and gives a \\"field researcher\\" viewpoint on various stories and views on these creatures. He covers many incidents and the U.S./Canada throughout the book hitting on bigfoot, wendigo, the eastern bigfoot, Momo, Fouke monster, and the skunk ape/Myakka apes of Florida. Good overall coverage and fairly informative to those who have an interest in sasquatch. However, for those more habitual in their own personal research, it is a great addition to you collection but, as mentioned, it covers the entire continent. I'd like to have had him concentrate on the Pacific NW but then most other books will do that. I have respect for Coleman in that he has taken a step back and denounced that bigfoots and UFOs are related as he had previously indicated in other books. He does provide instances on the two phenomenon for those people interested in a connection.<br /><br />Overall, this is a well done book that will give you a large coverage of the US and Canada on the various sitings and stories through the years. Is it the best book out there? No, but it is certainly better than many of them. Thank you Mr. Coleman for a non-schlock filled book on the matter of Bigfoot.	2005-07-11
US	30908564	R1TS15HIJEWZU7	1591021391	154039455	Making Of Bigfoot Book	Books	2	21	28	N	N	The long long Long review	Reviews of this book will fall into the extremes of ratings: 5 stars by the skeptics saying Long \\"proved the film a hoax\\" and the 1 star reviews by bigfooters saying Long \\"didn't prove anything\\". Please bear with me as this may be long but hopefully enlightening.<br /><br />First & foremost, Greg Long's \\"The Making of Bigfoot\\" (henceforth TMoB) is not a book about saying Bigfoots do not exist. He is saying this particular Bigfoot does not exist. I actually enjoyed most of this book and I'm what you may call a \\"believer\\" in Bigfoots. Long goes into this book with one goal, obviously with predetermined mindset on his part, to tell us that the film is a hoax and gives his reasoning and `evidence' to prove it. The book can be broken into two sections. The first is Long's total attempt at the character assassination of Roger Patterson (RP), there's no other words for it, Long wants to believe RP has faked the film and has an apparent dislike of RP. The second part of TMoB is the skewed views of his `evidence' on the hoaxing of the film. Now I'm not saying the film wasn't a hoax but I'm not saying it wasn't real either, no one can say 100% whether it was faked or not except RP himself, who of course is dead.<br /><br />I truly liked the first part of the book which is based on interviews of people associated with RP and gave their views of his reputation. The second half is where it starts falling apart. As far as the interviews, the only people saying they knew the film was fake are those who disliked RP, their interviews containing a blatant dislike of the man. Nonetheless, you do discover that RP was less than honest and careless with his money. This does not discount the numerous flaws of Long's logic and evidence of fakery. Long is extremely leading in his questions and even tries to put words into the mouths of his subjects. In addition, Long may not realize it but he appears to try and intimidate his interviewees; he's a large man and when stories become questionable, he moves closer to his victims (for lack of a better word), overshadowing them, and then he has his wife fluttering around snapping pictures at inopportune times, possibly in an attempt to disorient the subjects. Moving on...<br /><br />Long goes to RP's supposed financer, Al DeAtley for interviews. By the end of his talk, Long has asked DeAtley no less than 7 times (pg 269) if the film was hoax which DeAtley denies saying he \\"believed it was a hoax\\" because he doesn't believe in the creatures in the first place. Long even went so far as to tell DeAtley, \\"until there's actual evidence that's satisfactory to established science that Bigfoot exists - until that evidence comes forth - this footage in your mind is a hoax?\\" So we have Long telling DeAtley that until science says Bigfoot is real then the film must be fake. What kind of reasoning is that? Long also shows his anger in his written description that he can't make DeAtley say as a fact he knew it was a hoax before filming.<br /><br />Interview process: Long claims he tape records everything so as not to misquote people yet his first two interviews with Bob Heironimus (Bob H) - \\"the man in the suit\\" - are not recorded and he uses them as a basis for his evidence.  He also conducts phone interviews with others jotting down notes to use. In addition to this, just reading his segments of interviews, Long is obviously not including everything that was said, he often refers to flipping the tape over yet the prior text could not have filled up one side of a tape (he uses a new tape for each subject), so he's not revealing everything himself.<br /><br />Long dwells on the matter of RP going to Hollywood to find investors for a film on Bigfoot and states that puts the film in jeopardy of being a hoax. Well, DUHHH, if you're going to try and make a documentary, the obvious place to go is a movie company for funding. It's no less damaging than Peter Byrne (who has no science background) getting funding from the Academy of Applied Sciences for his Bigfoot Research Project.<br /><br />Long has come up with criminal backgrounds on RP and Bob Gimlin yet nowhere does he indicate he search on one for Bob H. Bob H also held a multitude of jobs, just how many of those did he get fired from and, if so, for what reasons? Long doesn't look into this, rather he interviews some of Bob H's friends and relatives who say he was honest... not very thorough investigating there. Even Patty Patterson tells Long he needs to \\"look deeper\\" into Bob H's past which Long apparently does not do.<br /><br />Gimlin: Long is unable to obtain a complete interview with filming witness Bob Gimlin. This is the man DeAtley accuses of `wearing the suit' however Gimlin just isn't big enough. Long also focuses on the fact that Gimlin was stated he went from a 100% believer in the reality of the filming of the Bigfoot, to admitting he could have been hoaxed. Long likes to dwell on this but there is nobody that can claim with 100% certainty that the film is real, not even Bigfoot `believers'. I am a self-professed `believer' and I can't say it's 100% for certain to be real. The only one who could claim is now dead some 30 years, RP.<br /><br />Bob H flaws: during interviews, Bob H doesn't have a clue as to where he was for the alleged fake filming, not knowing town names, confusing Willow Creek to Happy Camp. He can't get close to approximate distance correct (2-3 miles from Willow Creek or 5-10 miles from Happy Camp - pg 404) and it takes Long telling him where he had to have been to make the distances plausibly fit. Later Bob H says he went through Happy Camp and saw a banner for a rodeo there, Long then proceeds to tell us that he had to have seen a Bigfoot Jamboree banner over Labor Day when he may have went through Happy Camp (that in itself is a wrong time frame the Long claims as evidence). Now Bob H is a professed ex-rodeo cowboy, you'd think he would know the difference between a rodeo banner and a Bigfoot banner, especially since he was on the way to play a Bigfoot in a film!<br /><br />Bob H also cannot recall details about the suit other than it were a 3-piece outfit made from red horsehide by RP and it stunk really badly. Okay, anyone (especially a \\"cowboy\\") who knows horses will not call a horsehide, alive or dead, red - it is a sorrel or roan. Long later claims that Bob H gives \\"a good technical description of the components of the suit and how the costume was designed to fit him\\" (pg 431) yet he can recall no details, and was allegedly asked by Gimlin to wear a suit, already pre-made by RP thus not `designed to fit' Bob H. The entire faction can't even decide if the suit was red, dark brown, or black as all three colors are used to tell what color the supposed costume is.<br /><br />Long then adds the chapter on Phillip Morris, a costume maker that claims he sold RP a gorilla costume that is easily recognizable by him (Morris) which RP used for the costume in the film (Long now firmly supports the gorilla costume over a homemade horsehide suit). Morris provides Long with a picture of an identical gorilla costume. The hair on the gorilla suit is quite long and the costume is composed of 6 pieces, remember Bob H is adamant it is only a 3 piece suit. Also, the `cowboy' Bob H can't tell the difference between a horsehide and a fake gorilla suit? Horse hair is actually very short unlike the alleged gorilla suit.<br /><br />Pat Long (the author's wife) dismissed Bob H's memory gaps to the filming happening 34 years ago (pg 405) yet Long continuously harps on about DeAtley's memory of `how and where the film was developed'.<br /><br />Eye witness reports on seeing the suit in Bob H's trunk is shoddy as Bob H says he came on from Eureka and went to bed, during which RP stopped by, took the suit from the trunk of car and returned a horse. Yet supposedly Bob H has been to several taverns showing people the suit in the trunk claiming `he's the man in the suit' before the film was even made public, thusly how would anyone know what he was talking about. Bob H also denies going to the bar upon returning home thus he didn't show off the suit before it was taken from the car while he slept.<br /><br />Other faulty `proof' is the Longs hinting that they can see light reflecting off Bob H's glass eye, Long claims to recognize Bob H's nose and cheeks in a blow up of the film even though Bob H says the mask covered his face.  Long can also see eyeholes and a brown eye in the blow-up but can't tell the fur is `red horsehide' or a gorilla suit? Let alone the entire concept of a blow-up of these miniscule film frames to pick out details like a `brown eye' is ridiculous. He also refers to a backward arch on the right foot and a flat no-arch on the left foot via blow-ups. These only occur in one frame so can be dismissed as tricks of light not to mention the entire film is classified as `fuzzy and grainy' by the author himself. Then Bob H claims he can prove he was in the suit... but only if someone can bring him the suit... all by putting his glass eye in the mask?!<br /><br />These are just a few examples of the shoddy evidence put forth by Long in this book. There are other entire factions that he didn't even touch on. There have been several people accused or claiming to be `the man in the suit' including accused actor Richard Kiel. Of all the people he didn't interview, Long didn't go to major accused maker of a suit John Chambers. He doesn't go to the Wallace family who claim their father (Bigfoot hoaxer Ray Wallace, d. 2002) told RP to go to Bluff Creek and knew who was `in the suit'. Then there is the fact he went on vacation in August '03 and went through Bluff Creek/Willow Creek area. It just so happens that I was on vacation in Willow Creek on Labor Day of that year and all over town were fliers for the upcoming Sasquatch Symposium to be held on September 12-14, 2003. Guests included major players in Bigfoot research, among them Bob Gimlin, who would take people to the film site. If Long is writing a book on this and hasn't properly reached Gimlin, why would he possibly miss this opportunity to be among the `top investigators and experts' for this symposium? This was before his book was published, why would you leave out something that stood to be of this much importance in your research? Of miniscule note, during this trip of his, Long passes over the Bluff Creek Bridge on Hwy 96, he speaks of the \\"roaring... deep, angry waters\\" (pg 437) below the bridge, having been there also, this is a severe exaggeration on Long's part thus showing his own acts of not telling the complete truth. This accompanied by the fact that as he points out, Rene Dahinden owned all the rights to still photos from the Patterson film; Long uses photos from the film in his book yet does not credit them as being provided by Dahinden (dead or alive). Doesn't this make him a thief and crook as he constantly lambastes RP as being?<br /><br />In conclusion, this book does nothing to lay to rest the debate over whether the film was hoaxed or not. His evidence is substandard (still no proof there even is a suit), his interviews were biased both for and against Patterson, his `man in the suit' is not reliable for information regarding the events, and his assault on RP (while brutal, lopsided, and seemingly predetermined on Long's behalf) is about the only redeeming quality in the book. Mr. Long, if you're reading this, maybe you should reread your own book and see the countless flaws presented therein. Oh well, let's see what the next `revealer of secrets' Mr. Daelging presents in his book.<br /><br />Also keep in mind, Greg Long's other book that has been published is in regards to UFOs and he wants to doubt the veracity of Patterson and his bigfoot?film!    Bob H also cannot recall details about the suit other than it were a 3-piece outfit made from red horsehide by RP and it stunk really badly.

Of miniscule note, during this trip of his, Long passes over the Bluff Creek Bridge on Hwy 96, he speaks of the \\"roaring... deep, angry waters\\" (pg 437) below the bridge, having been there also, this is a severe exaggeration on Long's part thus showing his own acts of not telling the complete truth. This accompanied by the fact that as he points out, Rene Dahinden owned all the rights to still photos from the Patterson film; Long uses photos from the film in his book yet does not credit them as being provided by Dahinden (dead or alive). Doesn't this make him a thief and crook as he constantly lambastes RP as being?    In conclusion, this book does nothing to lay to rest the debate over whether the film was hoaxed or not. His evidence is substandard (still no proof there even is a suit), his interviews were biased both for and against Patterson, his `man in the suit' is not reliable for information regarding the events, and his assault on RP (while brutal, lopsided, and seemingly predetermined on Long's behalf) is about the only redeeming quality in the book. Mr. Long, if you're reading this, maybe you should reread your own book and see the countless flaws presented therein. Oh well, let's see what the next `revealer of secrets' Mr. Daelging presents in his book.    Also keep in mind, Greg Long's other book that has been published is in regards to UFOs and he wants to doubt the veracity of Patterson and his bigfoot?	2005-06-16

Melinda and Bob Blanchard decide to open a restaurant on the island in what is supposed to be spur of the moment decisions. After a takeover in their last business (selling salad dressings nationwide), they are avoiding partnerships with others and must deal with the island etiquette of renting land, dealing with the meticulousness of claims at duties, and finding a place to live. We get a look into living on the island through the eyes of Melinda Blanchard, self styled chef and owner of the restaurant and meet a variety of characters in the employees that quickly assemble to form the Blanchard's staff. Throw in some recipes, a boat race, and Hurricane Luis which destroys the restaurant the first year and you get a nice quaint little travelogue that will be a quick and interesting read.<br /><br />Still, after reading the book and enjoying it, there is something about it that makes the whole venture seem much less 'spur of the moment' and less of a hardship than it seems to be promoted as. Here we have a wealthy couple that constantly travels, runs whimsical businesses, and is willing to drop $300,000 into building a restaurant on a 16 mile long island that caters largely to tourism and is subject to possible hurricanes every year. The business is almost an afterthought to Melinda who appears to want to live in Anguilla just to stroll the beaches and read books. None-the-less, the book is a wonderful break into island life and should you find yourself on Anguilla, you will want to stop at Blanchard's to meet the crew and enjoy what sounds like delicious dinners.<br /><br />One last thing, keep in mind, the authors aren't telling you the whole story of their experiences, past and present, which would affect your view on their \\"dream come true\\" story of this restaurant.	2005-06-10

This is Dahinden's book written with Don Hunter. It is obvious that Hunter wrote the book with Dahinden's input and you can see the distinctive spots where Dahinden adds his flavor to it.<br /><br />This is a prime book for someone that is generally interested in the bigfoot phenomenon as Dahinden relates the classics, the less-than-classics, and a few minor other stories. Of the Big 4, Dahinden was probably the most in-the-field, his passion bordered on obsession and he notes in the book that it cost him his marriage. Dahinden was a no nonsense researcher and he didn't hide it. Also he points out that he doesn't necessarily believe that sasquatches exist so much as he was adament about finding out the source of the massive amounts of footprints left in the Pacific NW and British Columbia.<br /><br />The book itself covers all the classic stories of Jacko, Beck at Ape Canyon assault, the Ostman Kidnapping, the Baumann attack, Cripplefoot tracks, and Patterson's film. Dahinden/Hunter also cover the lesser known classics of WA skier Carter's dissappearance, the Chapmans of Ruby Creek, and William Roe's close up observation of a bigfoot. He throws in a smattering of even lesser known sightings also. Dahinden also gives coverage of hoaxers Ivan Marx and Paul Freeman that always seemed to run into a sasquatch no matter where they went. He also talks about the multiple failed 'expedition hunts' and his partnership and falling out with John Greene.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great book for the mildly interested bigfoot fan as it covers all the stories. For the avid follower, this book is a must even though it is dated to 1980s. You'll get the classics and more from one of the vital members of early sasquatch investigation.	2005-06-07

There's a good deal of Bundy's biography here, but the relationship touted in the book regarding Ann Rule's friendship with Bundy seems, to me, to be stretching it for what she can. So she worked with the guy for a bit and then stayed in contact with him over the years... so what. That's like any of us writing a book about someone you worked with at a job you had in college. Rule seemed to be straining to show that she knew Bundy and were dear friends. I just didn't pick that up in this book. She seemed to be grasping to show she knew him. Otherwise, the book is a very good biography of a twisted man and his demented actions.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me about this book is the softness of it. Let me explain; in I-5 Killer, Want-Ad Killer, and Lust Killer, the author lays out the crime scene and actions as you go along in those books, giving details of what happened in the various assaults and crimes. The author avoided doing that this time, simply noting that so-and-so disappeared on this date or was found in this condition. Rather than giving the scenario and actions of the crimes, Rule glazes over them until the Chi Omega house assault, almost as if she were trying to convince herself that Bundy didn't do these crimes.<br /><br />Overall, its a good book to biograph Bundy, but the author dwells on what seems to be a self-convincing thought process that her and Bundy were best buddies or childhood friends and spent dozens of years together rather than one time coworkers that stayed in touch. The whole court scenes are drawn out and appear to be space fillers but none-the-less it was certainly readable.	2005-06-06

Just the cover alone becomes annoying with the cutaway partial cover. The story itself was subpar after his past efforts. The characters are not interesting for the most part and everyone in the area seemed to be involved in the storyline. Eric Wu, the torturing villian, is a revisited character from one of his past books. Grace Lawson is your heroine with the character flaw of having a bad leg. Carl Vespa and Cran are the most underdeveloped supporting/main characters in the book (Coben would ramble on about other people's backgrounds but left these two virtually without a history). Cora, the best friend, is unimaginative as a supporting character. The plot is so convoluted and messy as to be nearly unacceptable. The diversions of guilt were poor, and the police investigators linked everything together too easily. The whole background on the photo, which is the focus of the plot, left the ending stagnant. I felt there were so many problems with this book, that I can't recommend it to anyone, which is sad because Coben is a splendid author and normally has some very interesting stories. \\"Just One Look\\" should be as hidden as the ridiculous plot of the book.	2005-05-18

However, little is observed or investigated, psychologically or sociologically, into the reasons why these kids were killing people. While the book on a whole is interesting, it lacks any flow and is very dry reading. There were sections of certain chapters that tended to get \\"long-winded\\" and should have been eliminated during editing. Other chapters quickly flew over the results or trauma of the events of the deaths. Most of the instances in this book take place in the U.K. and short of reading papers from there, an average American has probably never heard of these criminal cases causing a further lack of connection.<br /><br />Overall, it's a mediocre book but could be used for a psychology class reasearch paper. I found the book to be a slow read yet still interesting enough to finish it.	2005-04-25

Okay, there a some slightly amusing stories in this compendium of travel and the best story is \\"The Snake Charmer\\". For a best of humor moments, this collection is sadly void of the humor. Not to say the stories for the most part weren't nice little snippets of their travels, but overall it falls far short of being outright boisterious. The high points of interest are Snake Charmer, Monstrous Dildo, and the explosive release while attending a mass gathering of India peoples for a religious observance. Many of the stories range in length of 4-7 pages, hardly enough to get you interested and then they end abruptly. The book is worth reading, certainly, but not one I'm likely to reread. For me, the first half of the book was much better than the second half.	2005-04-11

After reading Tony Horwitz's \\"One for the Road\\", you'll find yourself thinking you can speak in Aussie slang. Same effect is people will look at you like you're a blithering idiot.<br /><br />This is the first book by Horwitz that I've read and I will be reading his others soon enough. As for this one, I truly enjoyed the book in its simpleness and easy flow of readability. The author takes a break from his job and decides he's going to finger it across the bush and outback of Australia. You join Horwitz as he gets ride after ride from small towns (usually nothing much more than a pub) and encounters a wide blend of personalities and lifestyles as he hitchhikes through the land.<br /><br />The lightness of Horwitz's writing is enjoyable and relaxing. His adventures through Australia consists of continuous short rides in which distance is measure in how many beers you need to drink to fight off the heat. He takes the circuitous route to get from Sydney to Darwin, travelling up the east coast, going inland, coming south through the middle of the continent, swinging over to Perth, and then coast crawling the west coast up to Darwin. Through it all he survives a nasty car wreck near Uluru (Ayers Rock), delves into the spiritual status of Uluru among Aboriginies, meets desperate opal miners, sleeps in a ditch with underwear over his head during a cyclone, peaks at Halley's comet, rides with a complaining Tassie family, endures the roadside junkyards of dead vehicles, fears to be the only Jew in the land during Passover, manages to realign himself with 'Nor'west Time', and strives to push through his dwindling interest in hitchhiking as he rounds the northern coast of Australia.<br /><br />Overall, \\"One for the Road\\" is an expression of survival by travelling through the central deserts of the land down under. It's a pleasureable read and a good introduction into what will become a favored author in travelogues in the form of Tony Horwitz. Whew, I made it throuw the review and only used one Aussie term in the title so as not to look like a mug, ocker, or cockie so now she'll be jake.nder.

I have a fondness for travelogues and enjoy the various essays of quite a number of authors, this book... not so much. \\"No Touch Monkey\\" by Ayun Halliday is a fruitless uninspiring book of boredom. Keep in mind, these are my opinions put forth in the review. The book on a whole was lackluster. It would have been nice if at the beginning of each chapter if Ayun would make a brief subtitle entry on just where she was and when she was there. This book is less about travel and more about where in the world Ayun could get stoned, mope about here boyfriend, and generally whine about her situations. She offers far too little on looking at a foreign culture and societies but rather dwells on her miserable existence at such locations. If she plans on backpacking around the world on a miniscule budget, then she should expect it to be less than Eden-istic. Evidently she also has some attraction to the words 'pancake' and 'guerilla' as she slips them into nearly every chapter along with her constant self-degredation, not forgetting to mention a small obsession with intestinal and bowel problems.<br /><br />I had read other reviews on this book and felt it worthy enough to purchase, I urge others to look more closely at the less complimentary reviews before making your choice on purchasing this book. It's easily the laziest and most uninspiring travelogue I've read. You have been warned, read at your own risk of boredom and monotony.	2005-03-28

In 'Last Chance to See', Adams takes his last chance to see a number of rapidly declining species starting with the aye-aye in Madagascar and proceeding to komodo dragons, mountain gorillas, north white rhinos, kakapos, baiji (blind Yangzte river dolphin, and a variety of critters on Mauritius.<br /><br />Adams manages to get the basic message across that the world will soon be losing the animals and he does so without getting all preachy about it. Adams' light-hearted writing style absorbs you into his journey with zoologist Mark Carwardine and keeps you interested in the trials the must endure to just get a peak at some of these creatures. This is also a weak spot in the book. Adams almost doesn't emphasis enough just how close to extinction these animals are. I truly enjoy this book but Adams takes it less seriously than he needs to. He could have been a little more preachy but then you may not enjoy it as much. There is a nice inclusion of a list of foundations to which you can donate to but is dated to the publishing date of the book.<br /><br />Overall, excellent read but the lack of hard emphasis on the topic drops it one star.	2005-03-21

I will read sections of it just not all of it. Keep in mind, these are works that were written for various magazines over a period of 15 years. There is no smooth flow from one adventure to the next but rather sudden large leaps. It is almost better to rate this book by its sections rather than the book on the whole. Some parts were just more interesting than the others. Here's my run down:<br /><br />  1. Treasure seeking in South America... lackluster - 2 stars<br /><br />  2. Gorilla Country... interest is rising - 3 stars<br /><br />  3. Tony & Susan Alamo Cult infiltration - even better, showing some interesting events that Cahill actually looked into, showing this \\"cult religion\\" to be much more voluntary and more of being duped than brainwashing - 4 stars<br /><br />  4. Jonestown, Guyana - this is the peak of the book, very interesting and after seeing the pictures of the mass 'suicide' it has an even bigger impact. This is the best piece in this book - 5 stars<br /><br />  5. The 'Terror of the Heart' section - Cahill covers things from public nudity, eclipse addicition, getting stuck on Marquesas islands, scuba diving around sharks, snakes, and sea lions. Nothing great here, meandering thoughts, kind of uninspiring - 1 star<br /><br />  6. 'Monsters' - Cahill talks about bigfoot and ice fishing for giant pike. I liked the bigfoot section but the ice pike fishing did nothing and is slow moving - 3 stars<br /><br />  7. 'Raggedy Edge' - Cahill covers surviving a walk in Death Valley, cave exploring, cliff skiing, and white water rafting in India. This was mildly interesting but was nothing spectacular - 3 stars.<br /><br />Cahill relates the stories in varying degrees of interest and enthusiasm, possibly changing of his writing styles over the 15 years and the various magazines formats may influence this also. Overall, mediocre, there's better travelogues. Maybe if Cahill did all this in 1-2 years continuously it would have had a better reception from me. The Jonestown coverage is well worth the read though.changing of his writing styles over the 15 years and the various magazines formats may influence this also.

'Sex Lives of Cannibals' has done so for me. I've read a couple travelogues before, most notably 'Last Chance to See\\" by Douglas Adams. Troost's 'SLoC' is equally enjoyable and manages to bring the reader to a tiny little atoll in the middle of nowhere. Troost's whimsical writing gets you laughing and yearning for more. Here is a nice enjoyable read for someone out camping or sitting on your porch during the lazy afternoon heat of summer. This book and Troost's insights make that one little part of your brain trigger making you think you might actually want to visit Kiribati someday just to see for yourself just how hot it may be, witness the decrepitness of Air Kiribati and the runway pigs, or see the Darwinism of the island dogs.<br /><br />Troost's ability to immerse you into his two years of adventure and experience in the far corner of the world will cause you to seek out other travelogues for other corners of the world, just to see what you are missing and let you live vicariously through the authors to those places you will probably never go. Other authors of travel essays should be grateful to J. Maarten Troost because 'Sex Lives of Cannibals' will help to boost the sales of their books as we the readers will hunt them out.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to another book by Troost, and after he went and moved to Fiji, I don't see that we will have much of a wait to delve into the island life of Fiji through Mr. Troost and family.	2005-03-10

Roddy Piper's is certain easily readable and you can tell his flavoring in it but it's simply not as great as he thinks it is. Now admitting I have read Lawler's book and enjoyed it to some small extent, I also enjoyed Piper's many anecdotes and straight forwardness in regards to his life.<br /><br />My problem with this book is that the sheer magnitude of Piper's egotism shreds the book on nearly every page. Piper seems to think that everything was/is as good as it is because of him, wrestling territories suceeded or failed depending on whether he was wrestling for them or not. Piper makes it out to look like everything in the modern wrestling era (1980s to present) revolved around him. Hogan's popularity - Piper's doing, Flair's legend status - Piper's doing, wrestling becoming mainstream - Piper's doing, McMahon's success - Piper's doing, WCW's fall - a result from not listening to Piper's ideas, wrestler's great mic skills - Piper's doing, Wrestlemania - Piper's doing, the Steroid Grand Jury case results - Piper's doing. Basically, everything he talks about in his book is a direct result of something he did and nothing would be as popular or successful if he didn't touch it. Just the sheer volume of his egotism makes me think less of him as a person. He is so caught up in himself that he doesn't seem to be able to distinguish that persona of Rowdy Roddy Piper from his actual Roderick Toombs self. He is so absorbed into this creation of Piper that he stays 'in character' throughout the book (although he claims that's who he really is).<br /><br />Overall, this book is certainly likeable and enjoyable, but Piper just can't help going over the top and cramming himself down your throat with his self-proclaimed greatness and influences.	2005-02-04

Most reviewers or fans of the Dynamite Kid will be based on his WWF British Bulldog era. Having lived in Montana during DK's career, I had access to his earlier years when he was with Stampede Wrestling out of Calgary. He was always a joy to watch then and you knew he was going to explode in a big way (no pun intended).<br /><br />The great thing about this book is also the weak spot of it from a different stand point. Billington gives you the story of his life as if he were sitting there talking with you. He starts off stories and then gets sidetracked by feeling the need to input a side story on someone he mentions in the original story he is telling you. That gives it the sense as if you are sitting in a room listening to him. This same wandering thought process also detracts from the book (thus a 4 out of 5 stars) because there's no chronological order but he jumps back and forth in his career timeline. He wanders off the topic alot but eventually gets back to what he wanted to tell you. Billington, at points, seems to have a bit of an ego but then all wrestlers seem to do that, even the ones that have no real influence on the big game. He also, at times, acts as though wrestling wasn't pre-determined and had scripted storylines. I'm not sure of the Japan style wrestling but it's pretty common knowledge that pro-wrestling is staged, especially during the 80s and 90s.<br /><br />Billington does manage to keep the reader engrossed in his life and gives you the grit with the grain concerning himself. He's not self-righteous about his steroid and drug abuse, rather fully admitting he did these things. He doesn't pass them off as an experimental supplement done once or twice like other big name wrestlers did. Billington is straight forward and not afraid to upset people by giving his opinions on them. He slashes into various stars like Hogan, Beefcake, Ultimate Warrior, Davey Boy Smith, and others. It's nice to see that some editors aren't concerned about being nice to everyone. This book is obviously not published by the WWE unlike Lawler, Hogan, Rock, and Foley's books are. Billington pulls no punches and gives it to you straight from his viewpoint., Ultimate Warrior, Davey Boy Smith, and others.

Christopher Murphy (along with John Green and Thomas Steenburg) have given us a great book for research, discussion, and tributes. I eagerly awaited this book since its announcement and was compelled to buy it just for having Green's and Steenburg's involvement. I'm so glad I did. While the book is thin, it covers quite a variety of data and many exceptional photos. I've got nearly every book on this subject, collected newspaper and magazine articles, television programs, and absorb whatever info I can get. This publication has added fresh new info and I'm delighted with it.<br /><br />Back in 1996, I wrote an 18 page thesis for college (Montana State University) anthropology class on the matter of bigfoot and received an 'A'. At the time I was grateful for Dr. Krantz's 'Big Footprints' which helped immensely. I wish I had Murphy's 'Meet the Sasquatch' also. This book could easily be used as a text book for a study in an anthropology class and I would recommend it for such. Granted you won't spend a semester studying bigfoot, but a special week of classes would be benefited by this book. This is not a book about sightings, this is a book about data, facts, evidence, contributions, and theories.<br /><br />Is this text the best book on bigfoot/sasquatch?... no, but it is among the best research friendly works published in the last 15 years. Truly worth every penny of the price.	2004-09-12
US	30908564	RX94OY4DYIUKP	0425197077	73763879	Dark Woods	Books	5	4	6	N	N	Good start for Kumar	I love reading books about sasquatch, either fiction or non-fiction. This novel is splendid and an excellent outing for Kumar to express his interest and/or experience in hunting, the outdoors, political maneuverings, business tactics, and manipulations of laws and codes. Deputy Sheriff Frank Vaughn becomes embroiled in a search for a wounded sasquatch and is shanghai-ed into taking along a corporate problem solver, a college professor, and a Fish & Wildlife employee. Each has their own motives for going on the hunt with Vaughn's being the self proclaimed moral reason of not leaving a wounded animal to run off into the woods without knowing if it is dying or will be okay. Manipulation from the varied party members and the undiscovered territorial sasquatches moves the story along nicely. There's a few good twists and turns and you take an appreciation of Chris Mackey's views on the possible and feasible abusive uses of the Endangered Species Act.<br /><br />Kumar could have easily slipped into the bigfoot-as-a-killing-monster horror story but thankfully avoided that instead using it for suspense. The book could have been a great horror story, no doubt, but I think it's even better by shedding the bigfoot in a less threatening force of nature rather than an abomination. Kumar could do justice to a good horror story if he were to use the wendigo legend, however (hint hint Mr. Kumar).<br /><br />I truly enjoyed this book as a novel and as a bigfoot fiction book. Not quite as good as John Boston's \\"Naked Came the Sasquatch\\" but certainly better than Richard Hoyt's \\"Bigfoot\\" and M.E. Knerr's \\"Sasquatch: Monster of the Northwest Woods\\" about a what-if injured bigfoot story (underrated book btw). I also rate books on the probability scale on whether I will ever read it again, \\"Dark Woods\\" is definitely one I read a few more times.	2004-09-12

The only downfall is the book is dated. You have coverage from around 1818 up to 1980. This covers a lot of sightings. The best thing about this book is that it deals only with sightings/contact and doesn't bog down with \\"Farmer Jones found some really big footprints behind his barn\\". Janet and Colin Bord stay away from footprint only cites.<br /><br />This is an excellent book for the person with a casual interest in bigfoot. It covers lots of stories and has a 'Chronological Sighting' in the back of the book that gives very brief entries for 1000 sightings. The main text of the book is 143 pages and has a very wide selection of encounters. That text runs choronologically throughout and although many of the encounters are just a few sentences, the book far outweighs Philip Rife's \\"Bigfoot Across America\\" due to Bord's book is pre-internet which Rife clung to for stories.<br /><br />The Bords due a very nice job of including all kinds of sightings, even some that are 'out there' such as UFO related ones. This is an excellent reference book and can be used for some very good research. Someone could easily use this book to make a nice data chart using the info contained within.<br /><br />Overall: For the passing interest person, this book is perfect for you. For the avid follower, this is a splendid referal guide to a multitude of sightings up to 1980. I just wish there was an updated version that provided coverage from 1980 to the present as a companion guide without using unreliable internet sources.	2004-09-03

I liked the first book well enough but it could have been better. Here in Tanner's sophomore book, he has improved and I enjoyed it much more. However, I must give both sides of my thoughts.<br /><br />The first 50 pages or so of the book are very sloppy. It seems like Tanner wrote several different beginnings and then opted to stick them all in. I found many annoying redundant items in these pages. 1. Everytime he used the word 'cryptid' he had to explain what it meant even though he already explained it 4 pages previously. 2. He did the same thing with \\"El Diablo Rojo, or The Red Devil\\", man that was bothering me like someone can't translate three simple Spanish words. 3. Most of all, in the first 50 pages, he constantly rehashes the first book (Shadow of the Thunderbird - SotT) and McQuade's camping trip as a boy. You can get away with it maybe twice but then it just got irritable. These are the only reasons why this book gets 4 instead of 5 stars.<br /><br />Now on to the good, other than the beginning, I truly enjoyed this book. Once you get past the bogged down beginnings, the story is well written and entertaining. Tanner cut down the James Bondish parts of the Chimaera Foundation and focused more on developing McQuade as a character. Ranging from McQuade's despondence over not having Alma around to becoming a lead investigator and team leader facing his childhood fear, the character becomes much more connective than in 'SotT'. Starting off with a filmed sighting in Ohio to the involvement of the Minnesota Iceman, we get some background on Albert Myers, the conspiracy theorist, and are introduced to new character the spitfire Belinda 'Billye' Carlton. From there we moved to Mt St Helens for the rest of the mission.<br /><br />The story from here is not quite what I expected and therefore I enjoyed it more. He does a great job using a Foundation contact tracker in Bobby Dandridge to inform the lesser knowledgable members of the team about numerous bigfoot encounters (Ostman-kidnapping and Beck-Ape Canyon attack). Trying not to give away the ending, I was very sastisfied with the inclusion of the Wendigo mythos as well. Tanner manages to give a different view of this legend too. I was also grateful that the Ian-Alma-Amelia triangle was dropped to the background and was a bit concerned that Alma would show up to save Ian by the end, thankfully she remains absent. One minor miscue is there was no direct closure issue for Cyril Pritchard which is how the book opens the set-up.<br /><br />Overall, kudos to you Tanner on an improvement over SotT, and now I am eagerly awaiting book 3, Wake of the Lake Monster. Just stay away from a jumbled beginning. I will definitely read this book again in the future.er knowledgable members of the team about numerous bigfoot encounters (Ostman-kidnapping and Beck-Ape Canyon attack).

Some people will enjoy it far more than others as you can see from the other reviews. For this particular book, I found it interesting but not captivatingly so. The author makes a concerted effort to employ your imagination with the legend of the thunderbirds and tries to get you to suspend your beliefs on secret research organizations.<br /><br />In the case of the Chimera Foundation, I just wasn't buying the hole setup of it, I found it to be rather James Bond-ish with its secret accesses and gizmos. I felt no real connection with the characters of Ian or Alma but hope that will change with the next book. I did like the neurotic conspiracy theorist Myers and the security head Burroughs. The relationships between Ian, Alma, and Amelia (?) are weak and uninteresting. As for the inclusion of the thunderbirds, that draws enough interest to get me to read the book. With heavy influence from Native American lore, the author does an adequate job of getting you to believe in the thunderbirds and the adventure leading up to their 'discovery'. But to be honest, I only found this book readable, and I probably will not read it again in the future (this being a deciding factor on the 3 out of 5 star rating).<br /><br />A detriment to the book, which is by no fault the author', is the shoddy job of editing and typos (at least in the copy I have). However, there were various points in the book when I felt that Mr. Tanner was getting a bit long-winded and was dragging out unimportant points or backstory to where I would lose interest and set the book aside for the night. I am truly hoping the next book is more enthralling as this one was just passable for me. As I mentioned earlier, other people will enjoy this book much more than I did and it is worth reading once.it is worth reading once. <br /> <br />	2004-07-27

George Kodiak is more of an anti-hero, he's violent and has social issues. The romantic interest between Kodiak and Cyrena is poor and is reminiscent of an elementary school crush on Cyrena's part, Kodiak could care less. The 'bad guys' Norm, Dave, and Montagna are over the top with Dave's obsessing of raping Cyrena, Norm's hygiene, and Montagna's greed and his implied government involvment is lackluster. The money man behind the whole hunt is simply so far fetched it is completely unbelievable what with his zoo and all. The only truly decent characters are Mrs. Hunnicutt, her development and involvement with the bigfoots was more interesting than the Bigfoot Hunter's group of the above mentioned characters. The most intriguing character is Ruth and there is a hint of a good possible story behind her origins but the author doesn't pursue the hints Montagna talks about earlier in the book.<br />Murphy begins laying out a possible decent story with the Hunnicutt character but then turns his focus on showing how despicable a person can be when he begins to push the bad-guys storyline. After this point, Murphy turns the book into a B-rated movie plot. There's no real speculation or development for the sasquatch, he makes them very uninteresting. The beneficial point he makes is that they are just animals with animal instincts and some higher brain functions, not horror monsters out to kill.<br />As a story, it's certainly readable and holds your interest enough to get through it. &quot;The Kodiak books&quot; will easily fall into a routine mystery formula that is so common throughout the literary mystery genre.	2004-06-30

It's a lengthy series but the books all are pretty thin, around 250-300 pages. Skeeve and Aahz are entertaining characters and with the additions of Tandy, Gleep, Hugh Badaxe, and others, its humorous fantasy that travels through dimensions on entertaining adventures. Each chapter begins with a supposed quote from someone real such as &quot;I'm just going out for a short horse back ride... G. Kahn&quot;.

Willard 'Captain Jester' Phule is in charge of the worst group of misfits and ne'er-do-wells that the Space Legion has to offer. Omega Company is a dumping ground for miscreants and Phule gets to change them. Being the son of Victor Phule, the munitions master of Phule-Proof Ammunition and Weapons, he is one of the wealthiest people in the galaxy. He takes his butler and money to improve his conditions and turn the rag-tag mob around by taking the company and running it as he would one of his businesses.<br />Overall, it is a good way to spend a few days in light hearted reading. It's your typical 'underdog overcomes all' scenario but the likable characters certainly betters the formula. Other books in the series are:<br />1. Phule's Company<br />2. Phule's Paradise<br />3. A Phule and His Money<br />4. Phule Me Twice<br />5. No Phule Like an Old Phule<br />Worth reading a few times for those lazy afternoon sunny days while relaxing on the porch.

I've read some of Coleman's other books and this one just isn't up to snuff. It's certainly readable and should be added to someone's library if they are interested in yeti, bigfoot, or cryptozoology in general. The book is titled for Tom Slick but Bernard Heuvelman gets ample coverage in this also. I wish there was more on Slick's activities regarding the sasquatch. The coverage of the yeti expeditions was the same basic coverage you can get in nearly any book on the subject. I know Coleman is a capable writer and researcher, and I was expecting better than this.<br />I've read and enjoyed other biographies much more than this. I also mention the numerous minor typos throughout the book, simple little things that should have been checked and caught in the editing process (there are quite a number of times there is a 'hut' or 'he' when it was supposed to be 'but' and 'be') but those are disregardable (by no means is my grammer or spelling perfect). There were also several occassions while reading this biography of Tom Slick in which I forgot the book was about Slick because of sideline stories or wandering off topic that didn't seem directly (or indirectly) involving Slick.<br />Mr. Coleman, best wishes but you are better than this.	2004-04-30

There was some entertaining moments for remembrance of ridiculous gimmicks but overall, it began falling flat about half way through. Reynolds dwells upon Hulk Hogan's movies rather than on actual wrestling for a lengthy chapter. Now I know Hogan's movies are unbelievable crap but I didn't really need Reynolds to rehash and summarize every one of the movies. He also rants about the Monday Night wars and the nWo at length after promising he wasn't presenting this book to look at the mainstream stars and stories.<br />While the book was certainly readable, I was expecting something a bit different, maybe more coverage on the lame ass gimmicks he began talking about. There was more to Scott Hall than the nWo afterall (he did portray a gator wrangler). The further the book went, the more Reynolds talked about the big stars.<br />Overall, the book is entertaining to some degree and a wrestling fan will enjoy it. I expected more focus on the could-a-been gimmick-wrestlers and stories rather than the superstars and major storylines. Maybe some of the dumbass gimmicks the stars used to be (Blue Blazer, Starship Coyote, Big Bully Busick, Planet Stasiak, Raven's Nest, the Skyscrapers, Powers of Pain, etc.). I certainly could have done without the movie review chapter and the author's venting of his despisal of the nWo and the McMahons.	2004-03-05

This book is very weak in material and the author goes off on tangents with fish and birds. He tries to use fossil records of other large animals from the far distant past in his writings and it it just uninteresting. He covers three areas in this subject matter: Mono Grande of South America, Yeti of Himalayas, and Sasquatch of the Pacific Northwest.<br />Coverage of mono grande is based off of Turillo's (sp?) search for a giant creature. He also covers de Loys giant monkey of which there is considerable doubt of authenticity. For the yeti, he sticks to footprints in the snow which suffers from thawing and refreezing. For the bigfoot, he covers the popular stories of Teddy Roosevelt's Baumann, Ape Canyon, Albert Ostman, and Patterson/Gimlin.<br />Overall, it is a nice effort but falls far short of anything authoritative on the subject matter. The writing style isn't even that interesting. If you collect books on the subject of bigfoot, it's enough to put on the shelf but easily forgetable.	2004-02-23

If you have any greater interest the subject, this book could added to your collection but overall, it's mediocre at best and pretty bland.<br />The book nearly kills itself if you take a look at the references to the near 400 sightings the author cites. Of the 399 sightings that Rife collects, nearly half (about 175) of them are from \\"internet postings\\" so who knows how valid they may be. He also gleams subject matter from magazines like Fate and Saga and numerous UFO magazines. He continues on by snipping from other peoples work. The author doesn't offer any personal thoughts and the inclusion of the stories lacks any luster to them as he glazes over the purported occurances. Rife makes no claims to actually validating any of the stories, meaning he apparently just gleamed them off of websites with no apparent research or interviews with the actual \\"witnesses\\".<br />Rife pretty much follows a systematic and rather boring format throughout the book by basically covering every state in America and giving 3-8 occurrences for each state. The books text is only 183 pages cover 399 sightings ... do the math. A vast majority of the recountings are barely five sentences long and are often a simple three line paragraph. The book has no apparent research, interviews, or in depth interest in the matter of bigfoots. The stories seem to central on three encounter types: the 'peeping tom' bigfoot, 'car bouncing' sasquatch, and the 'roadside runaway' creatures.<br />Sadly, throughout the book, Rife seems to focus on very aggressive and hostile bigfoots that charge, attack, and menace people. There are an awful lot of stories ending with the 'victims' taking potshots at the creatures with their guns. The sasquatches throughout the book vary little in description, almost like the author used the words \\"black brown hairy manlike ape seven feet tall\\" in a search engine and then gathered up the hits.<br />There's just too many Internet posting reference stories in here to make this a valid book for any type of research. There's no original thought and the stories lack credibility. Virtually anyone (even you) could have \\"written\\" this book if you had access to a computer by using a search engine for bigfoot stories. Rife is also extremely careful not to mention any names even though any bigfoot enthusiast will easily recognize numerous stories... maybe he was avoiding some copyright or permission to use someone's name.<br />Overall, if you want a lot of simple encounter stories that may or may not be true, then get the book. If you want something on which to base an in depth thought provoking research, skip it. You definitely don't want to use this book as a basis for any type of research paper, as a many of the reports are internet postings. Good for your bigfoot book collection, not good for any stimulating reading.<br />Sorry for the beating I gave you Mr. Rifed up the hits.<br />There's just too many Internet posting reference stories in here to make this a valid book for any type of research.

The first half of the book is fairly interesting and Powell puts in a lot of personal views and hypotheses in regards to bigfoots. Some of them I found hard to agree with as he seemed to base his ideas off one occurance and then refer to &quot;in many cases&quot;, without giving any secondary event of the same situation. He does this numerous times in the book. The chapter on the Skookum Expedition was a toss up. He presented a decent write up on the matter but also seemed to want credit as the man who thought up the idea of baiting mud holes for potential tracks.<br />The main reason this book doesn't get a higher rating is simply for the &quot;Vanishing bigfoot&quot; and &quot;UFO and Bigfoot&quot; chapters. He throws these two in to &quot;cover all the bases&quot;. I felt it was completely unnecessary and actually detracted from the book and subject matter to a vast degree. He also hints at some mental or telepathic abilities in parts of the book, which came of as a bit cheesy.<br />This is a nice introduction for a casual reader if you forget the two above mentioned chapters. For the avid follower, go for it and add it to your collection,just ignore those chapters if you think it's going too far.	2004-02-03

I was lucky enough to have been working in a bookstore when this book first came out. I walked past it everyday and it always caught my eye so I finally bought it. This may be the best book I have ever read. It has great characters, fantastic imaging from the descriptions, suspense, murder, humor, and monsters. It has gotten to the point that when I read this book, I actually visualize it as a movie with Bruce Campbell playing the main character Michael Fenberg and Janine Turner as Elaine Mitikitski(oh if it would only happen). It's a truly visualizing book from the reflections of Tuberski's See-Em-Dead Zoo Bar and Grill Massacre to Fenberg's giant truck to the Mogonogonovich Brothers brutish antics; it's a riot and so enjoyable. You'll read this book until it falls apart (then you'll tape it together over and over again).<br />I have recommend this book to numerous people and all of them are grateful for having got it. I got my wife to read it and well to make a long story short, we read it so often that I've had to buy three replacements because they get worn out (my prize one is I managed to snag a John Boston autographed copy). By all means, have no doubts, GET THIS BOOK! You will not be displeased.	2004-01-30

I'm glad I did. Robert Alley takes more than a passing interest look into the sasquatch phenomenon and keeps it to a region he is fairly familiar with, the coast and islands of British Columbia. Alley does an excellent job in his research and reiteration of the stories/sightings that he was told / investigated. For those that enjoy a good thorough look into sasquatch/bigfoot, pick this book up but keep in mind, Alley sticks to a limited region here; he does not talk about occurances in the U.S. as those can be found in many other books. It is a fairly limited geographical region he covers but he covers it exceptionally well. Definitely a book to pick up for the avid bigfoot follower.	2004-01-20

For the size of this book (about 135 pages) it's really more of a thick pamphlet. The content within is limited but he is dealing with more localized people to the Alberta area, though he does jump into British Columbia in this book also. For a beginning book on the subject this is a good introduction into the sasquatch. It's by no means the best book on the subject but it will peak your interest. His second book, \\"Search for Giants\\" is much better. The 5 stars on this book is for it being easy to read, you can read it in a few hours, and the content vs page number is good. You don't get bogged down by listings of all the local names for a bigfoot. Just straight forward stories from alleged witnesses. The author lets you know he 'believes' in bigfoots but lets you decide on your own, he's not pushy about it in this book.<br /><br />The nice part of his books is that he sticks to the areas he knows - Alberta, Canada. He does a great job in his retellings and 'research' of sightings/footprints. He covers many fresh stories and tends to stay away from the well known ones and U.S. occurances.<br /><br />Steenberg spends alot of time travelling and produces some good interviews, as seen in his other book. Easy and quick to read and pretty enjoyable because you aren't getting rehashings of all the popular stories (Bauman, Ape Canyon, Patterson/Gimlin, etc). These deal with the more private citizens that just happened to have witnessed something out of the ordinary.<br /><br />For a good coverage of Western Canada, pick up Steenberg's books and \\"Raincoast Sasquatch\\" by Robert Alley and you'll have some excellent reports thoroughly covering this region.	2004-01-20

Rather than rehashing all the old stories, this book looks into the psychological, mythical, and underlying tones on the legends of creatures such as Sasquatch, Bigfoot, Wendigo, and others. This is a collection of essays from quite a number of people ranging from anthropologists to professors on mythology. There are in depths looks at perception and myth-influences as well as scientific looks at tracks, fecal matter, hair samples, and vocal recordings in relation to these creatures.<br />  If you just want some stories on sightings, this is not the book for you. If you are an avid follower, this is a prime book for research and views on thought processes and mythos influences. It doesn't answer the question if Bigfoots exist but is an excellent book on perceptions and legend creation.	2004-01-14
