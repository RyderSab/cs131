I use it often when I need a good outdoor scene for a painting. I really like to use the landscapes that depict sunset/sunrise. This book has most definitely been the most used art reference book in my studio. <br />My only complaint is that I wish he had incorporated scenes that invoke Alaska. Other than the  absence of glaciers this is a pretty good book. I hope if there is a second edition that he remembers to include glaciers and frozen ponds. Afterall, the Alaskan landscape is a part of America too.	2002-02-16

It's an excellent guide if you know what you want to put on your page but are mystified about the HTML codes to use to produce the effects you're looking for. This book even includes a guide on how to incorporate multi-media on your webpage.  This is the best book I have read thus far on the subject.	2001-08-11

I am a Math Phobic person and for me this book is practically My Laboratory Math Bible. This book alone helped me, a Math Phobic, to finally  understand laboratory math. The Campbell's are truly gifted when it comes to making things understandable to the nonmathematically inclined Labortorian.<br />This book  has almost every imaginable formula that you could possibly need in the clinical lab. There's tons of examples and exercises coupled with clear concise explanations throughout. This is the best book on the market for Laboratory Science students and for those who need a brush up on lab math.	2001-01-16

There are well over 1000+ questions in this book. It covers the seven majors areas of Clinical Science. Those areas are Hematology, Immunology, Immunohematology, Clinical Chemistry, Body Fluids, and Microbiology. The thing I found really neat about this book was that it gave detailed explanations at the end of each review section. So you got the opportunity to learn a little something extra even if you did got the question right.<br />My only complaint about this book is the disk. I could'nt use it because I have a CD-ROM drive. Don't they know that the majority of computers that are coming out today have CD-ROM drives? I hope that the latest version of this book comes with a CD-ROM....because disks are just so late 20th century!  :)	2001-01-16

There are forty exercises in the book that guide you in essential techniques such as brainstorming, clustering, freewriting, and revision.

I learned a lot about how white  artists  viewed Black female subjects. <br />My only criticism is that I wish that they  had more recent art work in the book. The artwork primarily shown and  covered in this book is from the later half of the nineteenth century and  the early part of the twentieth century. There are absolutely no paintings  from the 50's,  60's,  or 70's. However, there are three painting from the  80's and 90's. It's almost like after 1948 white artists stopped painting  pictures of black women. Overall, I have to say that the book was very  educational.	2000-07-08

This is a good book for looking over different types of animation methodology. The best section by far in this book is the one on stop motion animation. It showed the step by step building of two stop motion  characters using two different types of joints. It included suggested tools  you should use in building your character. It also included the pro's and  cons of different types of set construction. Also included in this section  was how to set up the studio for filming. The type of camera lense you  should use. The visual effect different types of lenses would have on your  scene. The cool thing about all this detail was that it was not drawn they  showed actual full color photographs!	2000-04-30
