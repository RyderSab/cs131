In each instance his dog Lilac is with him.  (We had no idea he had a dog.)<br /><br />An example of the kinds of things you will see: Harold, Lilac and the fast boat.  Harold is steering, while Lilac is being pulled behind as she water skies.  With the circus scene, Harold is holding onto a bone (on a unicycle) while Lilac leaps through a hoop.  Harold is in clown makeup.<br /><br />At this time there's no 'search inside' feature with this book so I'll give you an example of the text from the last 4 pages.<br /><br />\\"Harold and Lilac are tired and need to get back home.<br />This *taxi cab* will do the trick.<br />Harold is sleepy.  It is time for bed.<br />Tomorrow is sure to bring new adventures.\\"<br /><br />Because of the going to sleep part of the story, this might make a nice bed-time book.  Otherwise, the images of a boy and his dog at the circus or in other interesting places ought to entertain a small child.<br /><br />Three to Four Stars.  An okay book, it will likely not satisfy real Harold & Crayon fans, but babies probably won't care and will like the pictures of things that go.  As for age range, I think that this book is probably better for babies and toddlers.  Preschoolers will most likely prefer the original Harold and the Purple Crayon books with their 'drawing' fun.	2005-10-13

There is Blue, of course, Slippery Soap, Magenta and Periwinkle, Shovel, Pail and Mailbox, also Tickety,  Side Table Drawer and Mr. and Mrs. Salt and Pepper.  With all of these characters this book sounds like it's big, but it isn't.  (The only drawback really... a little short at 10 pages.)<br /><br />Take a look at the \\"search inside this book\\" Amazon feature to see what the text and artwork looks like.<br /><br />On the first set of pages (pictures take up two pages) Blue is in the bath tub.  The text begs you to join in and sing Blue's favorite song:  Old MacDonald's Farm.<br /><br />The second set of pages show Blue reading a book with Periwinkle and Magenta.  The text refers to the Hey Diddle Diddle poem and asks \\"Do you know this rhyme about a cat and a fiddle?\\".<br /><br />The third set of pages show Blue using her imagination.  The clouds in the blue sky overhead give you the opportunity to ask your child what the clouds are shaped like.<br /><br />The fourth set of pages shows a garden in which Blue is trying to find some of her friends.  There are vegetables to discuss with your child, as well as flowers and the colors of various plants.  Your child also has a chance to find Shovel and Pail and Mailbox.<br /><br />The final set of pages has the text \\"Of all the things Blue likes to do, she especially loves to play Blue's Clues with you!\\"<br /><br />Four Stars.  A fun book for baby and toddler.  It gives a caregiver some opportunities to teach and have fun.  We only wish it was longer.	2005-10-12

Possibly an important book.  Personally, even as a mom, I hadn't given pornography much thought.  Who knew that I should have.  Apparently since I was a child, the porn industry has blossomed from a simple Penthouse/Hustler/Playboy kind of thing into this huge multi-billion dollar industry (yes, BILLION).<br /><br />An industry so large and economically effective that it is managing to draw in more traditional media.  Consider what MTV and Hollywood puts out for our children.  Both of these realms, for example, have come to accept strippers as everyday stuff.  After all, what does Pamela Anderson and Paris Hilton  have in common.  Give up... sex tape exposure that made them super stars for the under 20 age group.<br /><br />But before you put this book down because it sounds like it's going to be coming from a frothing `puritan' or feminist, don't.  This is, in fact, a very adult/mature book that doesn't stop from describing in detail what `acts' the interviewees are talking about.  Neither does it stifle the language by asterisks or whatever @$%$#*.  (warning about both if you are sensitive.)<br /><br />No, this interesting book that has plenty of valid, convincing statistics to back up the personal stories of interviewees.<br /><br />Five Stars.  Not puritanical in approach, nor feminist.  Pamela Paul looks at statistics and gives personal stories of users:  some in trouble, some not.  [Lets face it, if you are using for more than 30 hours per week, you're in trouble. LOL]  Important book if you don't want to live in ignorance.	2005-10-10

Counting, Problem Solving and more	In this adventure, Dora sets off to return her library books.  If you don't remember the television show, the obstacles include not knowing how to get there,  the Grumpy Old Troll, a storm cloud, icky-sticky mud, crossing Turtle River, and a closed door at the library.<br /><br />Most of these obstacles are solved with the help of Backpack and your child.  The Map shows the way, and Backpack has the supplies to solve most of the problems if they only could figure out what to use.  What Backpack can't do, you child can, by helping to point out what to use.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />What I like about this book is that there is alot to learn.  Children can learn all about maps, for example.  How they are representational of real terrain and places.<br /><br />It also lets you and your children practiced rhyming.  The Troll's quiz, for example, begs the question of what rhymes with `guizzers'?  Scissors!<br /><br />And the Backpack sequences lets children look at a collection of items, recognize their use, and then select the appropriate item.  Sort of like, Problem Solving 101.<br /><br />Also, there are many opportunities to count throughout the book, though the most obvious chance comes at the end when Dora counts to make sure that all of the books are there.<br /><br />And finally, one of my favorite things is that the story is about the Library.  Dora is associated with books and reading, thus setting a good example.<br /><br />Four Stars.  One of the better Dora books.  In this one your child has plenty of opportunity to answer questions and help out their pals.  Counting, Problem Solving, and more all at a good price.	2005-10-10

Since my children are young (boy and girl; 3 and 5) I am more interested in giving the `flavor' of the times  without being particularly stuck on historical accuracy.<br /><br />The first book that I found that we liked was Aliki's \\"Johnny Appleseed\\".  Andrew Glass' \\"Bewildered for Three Days\\" is the second.<br /><br />In this book, Glass weaves a tale (definitely fictional) of why Daniel Boone didn't really wear a coonskin cap-although the cap is one of the things he is known for.  In this story, Glass touches on what life was like in the 1700's.  He talks about how there were Indians who were friends and Indians who weren't.  Boone is shown with a childhood friend who, as a Delaware, showed him woodcraft.<br /><br />\\"Little Beaver returned often.  We wrestled and practiced tracking animals silently as shadows in the woods.  Little Beaver taught me to listen well to the chatter, chirps , and croaks in the forest.\\"<br /><br />Pros -<br /><br />--Story is interesting and an easy read-aloud.  It uses some archaic speech - thee and  thou - but just here and there.  Enough to be interesting and educational, it doesn't bog the story down at all.<br /><br />--The book touches on country life - log cabins and farming - as well as on what sort of things occurred which led to arguments between the settlers and the established peoples.<br /><br />--There is a nice Author's Note at the end of the book (as well as a map which shows the Cumberland Gap) which summarizes current research on Daniel Boone - when he lived, what he did, his family life.  I found it to be a good refresher, reminding me of details that I could point out to my children.<br /><br />Possible Cons -<br /><br />--There is an element of violence.  Boone as a boy is chased by angry Indians and awakened by an angry bear.  There is nothing graphic, and I, personally, just glossed over it.<br /><br />--The artwork is impressionistic and some younger children might not like it.  Mine 5 y.o. didn't mind.<br /><br />--The story is told in first person which may take some adjustment for some younger children who are used to the third-person.<br /><br />Four Stars.  A good story with lots of opportunities to teach.  There is lots of action and things that children can relate to, such as friendship and forgetting to do chores.  A nice introduction, though fictional, to colonial times..

So instead, I am going to comment on the one thing that occurred to me while reading it to my 3 and 5 year-olds.  That basically, while Amazon has suggested this book for the 4 to 8 age range, that I think that 7 and older would be more appropriate.<br /><br />One reason is the artwork.  The pseudo cubist style (aka Duchamp or `Bear ascending a staircase' LOL) is not in every four year olds favorite style.<br /><br />But a more important drawback is the fact that this book deals with taxes and slavery.  While, I applaud the author for broaching the topic of slavery, and to a lesser extent taxes for youngsters,  I have to ask, what 4 year old understands either topic.  For Heaven's sake, my children don't even comprehend money, much less taxes.  And being one of those moms who is trying to `extend' their innocence, I don't want to introduce the meanness of `slavery' and man's injustices to his fellow man quite yet.  Slavery is just such a nasty topic that I personally don't plan to bring it up after my child has a little more exposure to the workings of the world.<br /><br />Three Stars.  A neutral rating based on age limitations.	2005-09-15
US	46849857	ROBD0VS2JOTA3	0375806970	907425247	Ten Seeds	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A Review of Ruth Brown's "Ten Seeds"	I have to admit to being one of those mom's who likes books that not only entertain but also teach something.  Who wouldn't want to find a book that has great art, a story,  AND that teaches math (and in this case science) as well--wahoo!<br /><br />In this light, `Ten Seeds' provides alot.  First the artwork is very nice, and the story, while short, is cute.  As indicated by the other reviewers, a boy plants 10 seeds and one by one their numbers are reduced.  This is a great way to introduce subtraction and to make it more `concrete'.  (This also works with M&M's by the way.)<br /><br />But in addition to this the artwork introduces some science.  First you can see how the seeds grow, first putting out a single root that splits, then roots multiply, and the tiny plant sends out the first leaves that seek the sun.  These false leaves give way to real leaves and then a flower which blooms (sunflower), grows old, leaving the boy with more seeds to plant next year.<br /><br /> And lest we forget, there are animals to talk about.  The seeds/seedlings are reduced principally by living organisms such as an ant, a pigeon, a mouse, a slug, a mole, a cat, a puppy, greenflies.  Some of these are not the usual animals we see in kids books.  And in addition there are other creatures that can be seen beneath (and above) the ground such as earthworms, bees, ladybug, and other unidentifiable squirmies.<br /><br />Five Stars.  The artwork is very nice and the pages are more substantial than in many books for this age range.  The plot is a little simple, but there is lots of message:  science, math:  the seasons and how things grow.	2005-09-15

Concepts covered are:  big/little, happy/sad, open/closed, neat/messy, backward/forward, high/low, short/long, full/empty, and near/far.<br /><br />Pro's- popular Disney characters such as Pooh, Roo, Eeyore and Tigger will keep a young child's interest.  The book not only uses comments by the characters -such as Piglet saying `I am happy\\"-as an example, but also has text at the top of the page which asks questions (an aid to the reader) such as \\"Who is *big*?  Who is *little*?\\"<br /><br />In addition, it is nice that they include neat and messy as an example, which most opposite books don't.<br /><br />Con's- One or two of the examples are not going to be clear to young children without the parent/reader's helping them to understand.  For example, Roo has a book that is `closed'; Owl's is open.  The picture of the closed book is not perfectly clear.  (But then again, one need only close the little boardbook to demonstrate.)<br /><br />The other example is long/short.  For some reason they have Piglet with his short stick further back in the shot than Pooh with his long stick.  Very much in the position of the characters when they demonstrate near and far.  Not a big problem but a toddler might get temporarily confused, possibly concluding that sticks in the distance are by nature short.<br /><br />Four and a half Stars.  A sturdy little boardbook that uses very popular characters that should keep any little fan's attention.	2005-09-15

On the first page there is a large, up-close picture of a baby animal, and on the second page are three smaller pictures showing the same or similar babies engaged in an activity, such as sleeping, running, or exploring.  The pictures are labeled below so that a parent/reader can point at the word when speaking the action.<br /><br />On the pages for the ducklings, for example, there is a wonderful picture of a sweet little yellow duckling swimming.  The water is clear, so that you can see him both above and below the water.  This is helpful because some children don't immediately grasp that a duck continues beneath the surface (lol).<br /><br />The second page has three pictures, showing different ducklings, 'tumbling over', 'waddling', and 'floating'.<br /><br />Similarly the puppy page shows a big picture of a puppy sleeping, with three subsequent pictures showing a puppy: bounding, licking and playing.<br /><br />Four and a half Stars.  Besides just nice pictures, this book offers a reader the chance to point out baby animals engaged in activities with the word below, enhancing the human baby's book experience.	2005-09-15

I became a mom and lost my sense of humor.  What can I say, I do not like \\"Miss Nelson is Missing\\".  At least not at present.<br /><br />Perhaps when my children are older I will think nothing of the anti-school imagery that this book evokes, but for now, when my eldest is just about to step into the halls of elementary school for the first time, I do not like the negative images of children and school that are presented.<br /><br />My first objection is that the children are thoroughly disruptive and disrespectful.  When Miss Nelson asks them \\"in a sweet voice\\" to settle down, they don't.  Instead they whisper and make faces and are `rude during story hours.\\"  They make spitballs and paper planes and are generally not the sort of children I want mine to emulate.<br /><br />Sure, at the end the `bad' children come around; but whose to say that part of the story will sink in with younger children.<br /><br />Two Stars for us.  (Forgive me, I've lost my sense of humor, but hope to regain it someday.)  In my opinion, this is not a superlative book for children under the ages of 7 or 8.	2005-09-15

Gets Her Own Library Card	You've got to love a book that makes getting a library card magical.<br /><br />This Arthur story begins with DW's desire to check out 'Hop-a-long the Frog'.  She asks Arthur to do it for her but he refuses because he doesn't want to be seen checking out a 'baby book'.<br /><br />DW retorts that when she gets her own card she will be free to check out whatever she wants.  It turns out she's old enough, but before DW can get one she has to be able to sign her name.  [Having just gone through this with my own 5 year-old, I can tell you that it *can* be an ordeal (LOL).]<br /><br />DW practices and practices--a mini-lesson in itself - until she can do it.  But the story isn't finished yet.  First DW has to WAIT because someone else has checked out `Hop-a-long'.  Then, after it's returned, the Tibble twins, who had the book, misinform DW and tell her that if the book gets damaged that the librarian will take away her library card... forever!<br /><br />Of course, that's not true and eventually Arthur corrects her, but not before he discovers that the book *isn't* a baby book but a `great book' that he remembers checking out when he was younger.  Arthur then reads the book to DW (she hadn't before because she was afraid it would get damaged) and explains that she can renew it and read it herself later.<br /><br />Five Stars.  All in all a great book that takes some of the 'mystery' out of the library process for small children.  I like that it opens the opportunity to emphasize that while it is important to take care of books, that nothing horrendous will happen if a page gets wrinkled.  I also like that Arthur is shown reading to his little sister, and that books, reading, and the library are cool.	2005-09-14

[Inside a box; inside of a state; inside of a country.]<br /><br />The artwork is colorful and appealing, the children seem personable enough, and my children (3 and 5; boy and girl) liked the story enough to hear it through a few times, but the \\"Booklist\\" reviewer was right in that it seems a little long.<br /><br />In addition, I would add that there is only so much interest that can be aroused by what's inside another thing.  Or to put it more bluntly, this book wasn't very interesting to us after a few days.<br /><br />Three Stars.  Nice artwork.  A chance to discuss the concept of 'inside'.  But generally, an odd little book that is probably worth checking out of the library, but not purchasing.	2005-09-11

Farmer Ben's dog, Queenie, has had puppies so, of course, the children are entranced and want to take one home.  Mama manages to put up a good fight until Farmer Ben puts a sweet, warm, puppy in her arms.  Oh, well... we know how that goes.  Puppies have a way of melting hearts.<br /><br />My children (3 and 5; boy and girl) like this book and so do I.  Besides being a straightforward story, it touches on all of the 'puppy' raising issues.  Little Lady (their dog) leaves a puddle in one corner, and a 'calling card' in another.  [I like that the artwork shows the kids cleaning up, not mom or dad.]<br /><br />The puppy also gets into things she shouldn't and makes a mess, even of the recently purchased eggs.  The story ends with mama saying that she is going back to Farmer Ben's.  \\"You're not going to take Little Lady back to Farmer Ben's\\" cry the children.  Well, of course not, mama replies.  She's going to get more eggs.<br /><br />All in all, a great book for parents to read to children when the 'doggie adoption' issue comes up.<br /><br />Four Stars.  Better than average Berenstain Bear book with simple sentences that make a good read-aloud.

It is not so much that the text is complicated, but rather that so many of Franklin's activities don't make sense to a really small child.<br /><br />For example, electricity and diplomacy went right over my children's' heads.

Even at play, Ben was thinking.<br />He liked to swim, and often tried different ways. Once he made paddles so he could go faster.<br /><br />Another time he was kite flying near a pond and had a brighter idea. He went for a swim holding onto the kite string. Just as he had hoped, the kite pulled him across the pond.\\"<br /><br />Five Stars. Colorful, cartoon-like drawings that most children should respond to. And though it is a good, beginning introduction to Benjamin Franklin's fantastic career, it might be over the heads of many young children. Then again, you could just buy it and wait.	2005-08-24

They were shown together as a class, with and without their teacher, in circle time, with their snake, hamster and mouse, reading, counting, writing, and painting.  Basically doing what small children do in school.  The photos are nice and accented by hand prints of the children in paint.<br /><br />Three Stars.  I borrowed this book at the library at the beginning of this school year to show to my entering kindergartner.  Both she and her brother thought it was okay and sat through more than one reading, BUT... I wouldn't recommend buying it.  Borrow yes, buy no.  Just not enough to hold a child's interest over more than a week.<br /><br />Note: if you are looking for a book about how big 'kids' were once little babies, we liked \\"Now I'm Big\\" by Margaret Miller.	2005-08-24

In this book she covers a wide variety of aspects of Corn.<br /><br />She begins by explaining that a corn kernel is a seed.  She then shows how sun and rain affects the planted seeds.  There are drawings of developing corn with tassels and silk (boy and girl parts.)  There is a smaller drawing of the route pollen takes to get to the kernel.  The pollen travels down the silk to reach the kernel egg.<br /><br />It is at this point that I will say that I think 4 and 5 years of age is too young for this book.  (I have a 5 and a 3 and it was definitely over their heads.)<br /><br />But to continue-- The book discusses how other plants scatter their seeds but how corn needs people to survive.  It emphasizes that scientist have never found any 'wild' corn but only the `civilized' version we know now.<br /><br />From there the book divulges how native American were instrumental in developing the corn of today.  It discusses how some groups used to bury a fish under each corn `hill' and how growing beans and squash with corn made all do better.<br /><br />It then proceeds to show how corn was used by native Americans, how it was stored and celebrated in religion and dance, and how Christopher Columbus took corn or maize back to Europe.  The pilgrims appreciation of corn is discussed as well as the many,  many ways that corn and corn products are used today.<br /><br />Five stars.  A comprehensive book about corn for children.  The artwork is alternatively in color and grayscale, but this should not be a big drawback for those interested in the subject.  The age range as mentioned before, should be fairly advanced, say first or second grade and above.<br /><br />Example of text follows so you can gage reading level, etc.:<br /><br />\\"But although scientists searched,<br /><br />they had never found any wild corn.<br /><br />Not long ago they found some.<br /><br />It was in a cave in Mexico where people once lived.<br /><br />They found scraps of plants and tiny ears of<br /><br />ancient corn, more than 5,000 years old.<br /><br />It was not like any the scientist had ever seen.\\"und some. <br />It was in a cave in Mexico where people once lived. <br />They found scraps of plants and tiny ears of  <br />ancient corn, more than 5,000 years old. <br />It was not like any the scientist had ever seen.\\"	2005-08-24

At least not in their own bee book.  I typed 'bees' in Amazon book search and only two books came up; this one and another for adults by John Vivian.<br /><br />\\"Bees and Beelines\\" is part of the \\"Let's Read And Find Out Science Books\\".  Written by Judy Hawes a teacher, it is illustrated by Aliki (Brandenberg --she seldom uses her last name) in a simple fashion using a limited pallet.  This could be considered one of the books drawbacks.  The other drawback being that is was written in 1964.<br /><br />Now I am no bee expert so I have no idea how accurate the information remains, but I will say that it does 'jive' with what the Magic School Bus has to say about bees (I know its pitiful to be only able to reference children's material-LOL).<br /><br />But if you are willing to be corrected in the future, I think you will find this book fascinating.  It actually brought up features of bees and thoughts about them that I had never considered before.<br /><br />Interesting factoids:<br /><br />Did you know that young bees go to school?<br /><br />Did you know that young bees start off flying backwards away from the hive so that they can keep it in sight and find their way back?<br /><br />Besides these issues the book deals with the 5 bee eyes, bee guidance or how they navigate, bee dancing or communication.  I particular like that the book uses a little girl and her uncle to communicate the information.  The uncle in the book is a scientist and so young children are indirectly shown how scientists work.  How they 'think' they understand things but also how they are still working at getting solid answers.<br /><br />Five Stars.  If there were other books I might give it Four Stars because of the artwork which is a little bland.  But my, the other assets of the book are very good.  You could start to read this to a precocious 4 or 5 year old, but I think it would be best received by a 6 or older child.by a 6 or older child.	2005-08-19

[This book is the original, followed by the even better story \\"Joey Runs Away\\".]<br /><br />Joey and his mother, of course, are kangaroos.  In this story Joey's mother worries about him getting lost \\"...as mother do.\\"<br /><br />\\"She worried that Joey might get lost.<br /><br />So, to keep track of him<br /><br />she put Joey in her pocket.\\"<br /><br />Joey is initially comfortable in his pocket home. He has coloring books and toys to play with, but after a time he wants friends too, and this is where the fun comes in.  Joey's mom invites his friends over, and for a while they are happy to bounce around with her as she goes about her business.<br /><br />Then someone suggests TV.  Since Joey's pocket doesn't have one, a friend brings one over.  Next it's a stereo system, and then the gang decides they need to start their own band.<br /><br />With each addition, mom's pocket get larger and her eye's begin to bulge more.  The final straw comes after the addition of a guitar, tuba and drum set, when one of the friends pushes up a baby grand piano.<br /><br />\\"That will do!\\" said mother.<br /><br />OUT! OUT! Everybody out! she said.<br /><br />Out went the TV and the stereo.  Our went Bob and his horn.<br /><br />Out went Billy and his drums.<br /><br />Out went Betty and her piano.<br /><br />And out went Joey.<br /><br />\\"OOPS!\\" said mother.  \\"I didn't mean to throw YOU out!<br /><br />\\"Well, as long as I AM out,\\" said Joey, \\"May I go play?\\"<br /><br />With a sigh mom says 'yes', and reminds him not to get lost.<br /><br />Four Stars.  A lovely, silly tale that is very popular with my children (3 and 5 years old).	2005-08-19

My 3 yo even wants to go as Johnny for Halloween.<br /><br />Perhaps it is the friendly drawings, or perhaps it is Aliki's way with words, but I couldn't be more pleased at being able to introduce some Americana into their lives.<br /><br />Five Stars.

Beloved Veggie Tales character and silly concept, however this book falls short of being a good learning experience.<br /><br />The principle problem, I think, is that the topic and the age range is off.  For example, my son (3) likes the book, but his sister (5) found it boring.  By 5 and beyond, I think the idea of a triangular wheel is passe.  The problem with the 4 and younger set though is that they aren't quite sophisticated enough to comprehend all on their own, why it wouldn't work.<br /><br />We solved that problem by experimention with actual shapes, but if you have to resort to that, has the book done its job?  (I leave that to you to decide.)<br /><br />Two to Three Stars.  At some of the prices this book is available I think it would make an okay purchase for some Veggie fans.  Certainly my son has gotten his dollar's worth of fun out of \\"Pa Grape's Shapes\\".	2005-08-11

I really wanted to write a hardy recommendation for this book.  It has marvelous pictures and an interesting concept, but I am stymied in relaying how much *I* liked it, because my children did not care for it.  (They are girl and boy; 5 and 3).<br /><br />\\"Around the Pond\\" has marvelous artwork.  Big, sometimes double page, drawings of animals and children, but for some reason that was not enough to entrance my kids.<br /><br />The concept is that Cammy and William are out on a muggy summer's day picking blueberries.  As they walk around the lake they find 'telltales' of animals that have been there before them.  We see baby wood ducks in their tree nest, a baby raccoon and its tiny footprint, a daddy sunfish guarding his eggs, a beaver, a painted terrapin and her eggs, a garter snake and its shed skin, a blue heron catching a fish, and an otter.<br /><br />Why it didn't interest my children... I don't know.  Perhaps your children will like it better.<br /><br />Three Stars.  I, personally, would give it more; but my children would give it less.  This book has a nice concept and wonderful drawings.  My only objection is that the information on what the animals are doing (for example, what the sunfish was doing making a shallow bowl in the sand) was relegated to the last page.	2005-08-11

The drawings are warm and delightful and the 'peek-a-boo' aspect only builds on this. (There are half-size pages that when turned over provide a 'feeling' of action.)<br /><br />That said, \\"Copycat\\" does not have much of a plot and for my two (boy and girl/ 3 and 5) it did not draw more than one request for a re-read.

The language is stilted and somehow the comradeship amongst the characters is entirely lost.<br /><br />An example of how stilted the flow of the text is follows:<br /><br />\\"Peter played with his hat<br /><br />in the meadow.<br /><br />The bird sang up in the tree.<br /><br />A duck came<br /><br />into the meadow.<br /><br />She looked at the water<br /><br />and went for a swim.\\"<br /><br />At a level 4, I would have expected better flow.  And, of course, the character development and 'comradeship' between the characters is severely hindered by this unfortunate writing.<br /><br />Two Stars.  At the moment we have no book version of 'Peter' to recommend, but for a fine introduction to the classic Prokofiev tale, we highly recommend Sesame Streets video with the Boston Pops.	2005-08-06

It is the kind of book that gets children's imaginations going.  It is the kind of book where the fun doesn't end just because you are done reading it.<br /><br />A leaf is part of a tree.<br /><br />A wheel is part of a skate.<br /><br />A thorn is part of a rose.<br /><br />An elbow is part of an arm.<br /><br />A pit is part of a peach.<br /><br />The above are some of the `part of'  examples from the book, but if your children are like mine they won't stop finding things that are `a part of' other things for days and days.  And what more can you desire of a book than it is fun .AND. thought provoking.<br /><br />And while the artwork is not fantastic, it will probably look somewhat familiar in that Tom Dunnington has done regular work for the \\"Highlights for Children\\" magazine.<br /><br />Regarding reading level--  some words that are used are:  beach, bubble, caboose, cane, fish, handle, latch, nose, peach, shadow, skate, tail, tree, wheel.  They are all used in simple sentences such as:  \\"A barn is part of a farm\\".<br /><br />Four Stars (and possible even more).

I suspect that Margaret Hillert is a under-used resource by parents.  Why?  I don't know, because I have seen little in the way of beginning readers as interesting as hers.<br /><br />And I have to admit, they have prompted an interest in reading in my daughter (recently turned five) that the 'Bob' Books and 'Dick and Jane' did not, could not, do.  (There is just something about the classic fairytales that attract young children's enthusiasm.)<br /><br />If you don't remember (I had forgotten --LOL) the story involves a princess that just isn't happy.  Her royal parents try a number of things to get her to smile, but nothing works.  They then proclaim that whomever makes her smile can marry her.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a young man gains the favor of a little-old-man who leads him to a tree that contains, in it's heart, a magic goose.  The boy is told to take the goose to the princess, which he does.  But on the way a variety of people get stuck to the goose, so that by the time he arrives at the castle, he and his cadre are such a funny site that the princess can't help but laugh.<br /><br />HOWEVER, having said all of this.  You don't get this entire story in the Hillert version.  This is a reader afterall and the story is highly abbreviated.  An example of text follows:<br /><br />\\"You do not look happy, little one.<br /><br />We want you to look happy.<br /><br />What can we do for you?<br /><br />Here is a ball to play with.\\"<br /><br />There are 57 words used in the telling of the \\"Golden Goose\\".  Most are of the you, do, not, happy, little variety.  Larger, more difficult words are guess and something.<br /><br />Four Stars.  An interesting reader for young children.  My only caveat would be that you get the 'whole' story from the library first.  The reader doesn't tell the entire, complete story as clearly.	2005-08-06

Apparently somewhere between 3 and 7 years of age, because that seems to be the range in which you'll begin to hear your first 'horrible' knock-knock jokes.<br /><br />Pros of this book - My children like the flaps.  My 3 year-old son, in particular, likes to flip them over to see the punch line.  The jokes are pretty basic so most children can 'get them' (Although you shouldn't be surprised if they don't.  Word play if pretty sophisticated stuff.  None-the-less, my 3 y.o. howls at 'Anita bath'.)<br /><br />Another pro is the simplicity.  My 5 y.o. can read enough of the words to remind herself of the joke, and my 3 y.o. has just memorized them based on the pictures.<br /><br />Cons - There are only 10 jokes and all of them are name oriented: Olive, Ken, Anita, Duane, Sue, Sid, Luke, Wayne, Liz, Les.  I don't know if this will eventually cause them to tease other kids based on their names, but it's possible.<br /><br />Four Stars.  An okay book for a first joke book. The jokes are right on target for age ranges of 3 to 7 (and not baby to preschool as Amazon suggests).	2005-08-02

Now most of the time these two qualities would make a book a hit in our home, but \\"T. Rex at Swan Lake\\" just sat there without the usual `again' requests.<br /><br />The principle problem, I think, is that T. Rex is relegated to being a skeleton since this is modern times.  And at least for my two (girl and boy-5 and 3 respectively) they had a hard time being drawn into a story about a stack of bones.  (No dinosaur fanatics here, so do keep that in mind.)<br /><br />Two Stars.  It didn't knock our socks off, but if your children are dinosaur fanatics, they may like it better.

However, this is not a book for 'poetry snobs'--and you know who you are :-)<br /><br />This is a book for people who like poetry that creates images and mini-stories.  This is a book for the sort of people who like to be transported to crisp autumn days, the sound of leaves crunching beneath your feet, blah, blah ; or into relationships you've never had.<br /><br />It is not a book for people who want to be challenged by imagery and wordage.  It is a relaxing book, not a stimulating verbal ride.  And it is this dichotomy -- between regular-joe poetry readers and the ecstatic fancy-readers - that explains the variances in the numbers of stars reviewers have given this book.<br /><br />Four stars.  If you like Mr. Keillor's morning readings, you should like this book.<br /><br />Note:<br />This collection contains some `erotic' material.  Just thought you'd want to know, before you go out and buy this book for that special niece or nephew, or for your own child.

I read the harder words (at first) and she was just took off reading the rest!<br /><br />About the Book:<br /><br />It is written for the youngest beginning readers-- the book suggests those who have 6-8 weeks under their belt. We had none.<br /><br />There are 36 vocabulary words; the most complicated of which are `goats, three, something and funny'. (The rest are of the `see, the, go, up, down, I, look' variety.)<br /><br />There are 22 pages most of which have 3 sentences that are usually 3 words long. These sentences are similar to those of Dick and Jane, but the story line is actually much more interesting, or so I am told. LOL.<br /><br />That said, the story of Billy Goats Gruff is left limping with such simple sentences, so unless your child is familiar with the story you should read or tell them the full version beforehand.<br /><br />Four Stars.

There are 'workbooks' and there are Workbooks! and I purchased this after reading the reviews below and I have to tell you that it is not nearly as good as I was led to believe.<br /><br />First, this book can really ONLY used as a supplement to another text.  There is no progression in how material is presented nor much in the way of explanation -- a paragraph here and there in the back.  So if you were going to use this alone, you would have to come up with explanations yourself.<br /><br />For example:  on page 11, there is the 'sudden' introduction of calculators.  On page 159 the authors say (in total):  \\"If children have difficulty with the exercises on the page, suggest to them that they use their fingers or counters to find the answers\\".  THAT's IT.  Good luck.<br /><br />Another example:  on page 14, there is the introduction of tens and ones.  They have six problems showing a tens-stack (or multiple thereof) plus some one's.  Now this was precisely the sort of thing that I wanted assistance in teaching and showing my daughter.<br /><br />About this the authors say:  Make sure that children understand that the `1' in `14' stands for 1 ten, but the 1 in 41 represents 1 one. (Arggh.)<br /><br />Now I have been using the \\"Giant Basic Workbooks\\" up to this point and perhaps I'm spoiled, because I came to expect that material would be introduced and built upon, not just slapped down in front of us.  These are first graders, after all.<br /><br />Three Stars.  A Terrible workbook if you are looking for explanations or the slow introduction and building upon of math concepts.  (Definitely not good for homeschooling.)<br /><br />Probably a good book if you desire additional problem sets to work on with your school child.  Colorful though crowded pages.	2005-07-21

This book consists of worksheets without any coherent 'introduction', progress and testing format.  You won't find anything spelled out and explained, though there are answers in the back.<br /><br />In addition, this DK book (and generally we love their stuff)  DOES NOT correspond to what every Fifth Grade class is doing these days.  However, I don't really see this as a complete drawback, as one can look at the table of contents and make a decision based on that as to whether it is `right' for your child.<br /><br />The biggest drawback, as I see it, is that you can basically only use this book as a supplement to another text.  Or, in other words, It would make a bad homeschooling text.<br /><br />Three Stars.  Not a good homeschooling-type type book because you are left on your own to explain things.  An okay book if you are looking for additional problems for your child to work.	2005-07-21

This is a simplified version of the \\"Thomas Goes Fishing\\" story and to tell the truth we sort of like this version best as it gets to the point without alot of mucking about and ridicule from the other engines.<br /><br />The story begins with Thomas watching some children fishing by a bridge.  He `peeps' and they wave, and Thomas wistfully declares that he would like to fish too.  His driver chuckles at the thought, but every day Thomas sees the children and his desire stays alive.<br /><br />Nothing happens until the day, Thomas suddenly stops and complains that his boiler hurts.  [There is a great picture of the driver peering into Thomas' empty boiler].  Because his boiler is low and there is no water service station available, the driver proceeds to fill Thomas' boiler with water from the river.  And everything seems fine until Thomas starts to giggle.<br /><br />\\"Hee hee!\\" said Thomas.<br /><br />My boiler feels funny.\\"<br /><br />Well the driver looks into the boiler but this time it not only has water, but two fish swimming about!  Thomas' solution is to `peep' and attract his friends, the children.  His driver borrows a fishing rod and well... he and Thomas go fishing!<br /><br />Five Stars.  The artwork in this little book is wonderful.  The drawings are imaginative and bright.  And the simplified story is actually funnier to my two than the longer version.  And at this price, a worthy addition to the home sheds' library.	2005-07-20

It is one of our new favorites and I think it would make a fine addition to the home sheds of many a young Thomas fan.<br /><br />As the story begins, everyone at the train yard is getting ready.  The engines are getting shined up and are waiting... but for what?  Why, the local school children are going on an outing.<br /><br />Well, as we know, Thomas loves children and he very much wants to take them on a ride, but he has work to do on his branch line.  Sir Topham Hatt tells him, however, that if he finishes his work fast, that he may take the children home.  Thomas works hard to accomplish this goal, but is thwarted by fate, sheep and cows.  The book builds excitement about whether Thomas will get back in time.<br /><br />\\"Oh, no!<br /><br />Will Thomas be late?<br /><br />Will James or Henry take the children home?\\"<br /><br />The climax comes when Thomas is finally free to race home, only to be confronted by the scene of  his friend, Bertie, who has broken down.<br /><br />\\"Thomas wants to help.<br /><br />But then he will be late-<br /><br />much too late.<br /><br />Stop or go.<br /><br />Help or hurry.<br /><br />What should Thomas do?\\"<br /><br />Well, OF COURSE, Thomas stops to help his friend and it's a good thing he does because Berties' passengers are the very children that Thomas was racing back to see.<br /><br />The pictures in this little book are great.  The drawings show Thomas up close and with lots of facial expression.  The print is large and clear.  (I don't need my spec's. LOL)  But...<br /><br />...Here is where I have to disagree with the publishers.  They say that children from `preschoolers to grade 1' should be able to \\"recognize familiar words and sound out new words with help.\\"<br /><br />I've included some text above so you can judge for yourself if the level is appropriate for your child, but in my opinion this is not at kindergarten level.<br /><br />Five Stars.  Great Price.  Story and drawings are great, and if your child (like mine) can't read it now, they will be able to in the future.r child (like mine) can't read it now, they will be able to in the future.	2005-07-20

This sturdy 32 page hardback is simply a wonderful addition to any Thomas fan's library.<br /><br />First, it has some of the best artwork we have ever seen in a Thomas book.  The drawings are large, colorful and rich, and unlike some other books where the Steamies are shown from relatively far away, in this one the Engines are shown up close.<br /><br />Secondly, the story is about something worth talking about:  fear, courage and common sense.  And one of the things that I, as a parent, really enjoyed about this story is that it helps children to distinguish between things that they ought TO, and ought NOT TO, be afraid of.<br /><br />The story begins with Percy telling Thomas that he has seen a ghost.  When Thomas poo-poo's the story, Percy teams teams up with Toby to give Thomas a scare.  The fact that he runs for cover, ultimately leaves Thomas feeling bad about being a 'scaredy-cat'.  \\"You won't fool me again\\", he says defiantly.<br /><br />This attitude of bravado, however, gets Thomas into real trouble.  When on a run near the abandoned mines, he decides to ignore some \\"DANGER\\" signs.  As a consequence, Thomas ends up sunk in an old shaft.<br /><br />Rev. Awdry concludes of that misadventure:  \\"Thomas decided that being foolish was not the same as being brave.\\"<br /><br />The story ends with Thomas' discovery that the strange goings on at the castle and the malfunctioning signal have reasonable explanations behind them.<br /><br />Five Stars.  Simply a good tale, well illustrated and with a fine message.	2005-07-20

The text is:  \\"Each human body is a wonderful world!  Turn the page to find out how human life begins.<br /><br />How a baby grows in it's mommy's tummy - One page shows a mom and babe with the development of the mommy's belly and the relative size of the baby in silhouette.

A blue circle indicates where the food is in the process.<br /><br />The accompanying transparency depicts the parts of the body:  such as esophagus, liver, pancreas, etc.  The digestive processes, as well, is briefly discussed:  teeth, saliva, etc.  They do not mention stomach acid, but only say that in the stomach food is broken down even further.  They then say that it passes into the small intestine where nutrients are absorbed.  Then through the large intestine and out the rectum.<br /><br />Bones -- there is an xray type picture.  They touch on the structural aspects of bones as well.<br /><br />Teeth -The transparency shows an `xray' type picture of a boy's skull with bones, nasal cavities and teeth showing.

I purchased \\"How to Behave\\"  when my eldest was 16 months old and have picked it up again now that she (5) and her brother (3) have reached new developmental stages and developed 'new', not so desirable habits'.<br /><br />I have found, over the years, that the author is correct; that most of my children's 'behaviors' are the result of my behaviors; essentially what I have `taught' them is permissible behavior.  Misbehavior is not something innate in children, it is learned.  And it is true, when I see them doing something I dislike, I usually find that it is a variation of something that I have allowed or taught them to do.  [Take yelling for example.  When my eldest started being `loud', I discovered that I had fallen back into my old habit of yelling.]<br /><br />In this book though, Dr. Severe outlines not just one, but a number of approaches that a parent can use to resolve misbehaviors.  Not only by correcting your own -LOL.  And unlike other books, he gives role playing examples with sample dialog and actions so that you know exactly what sort of things you ought to say and do.  No trying to guess what the author intent is.<br /><br />Overall, a very useful and insightful book.  But it if you are the sort of person who can't imagine that you *personally* are doing something wrong that is aiding and abetting your child's misbehavior, then this book will probably not help your family.<br /><br />Four stars - A very good and useful book, minus one star for not being the easiest read.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom and reviewer at BooksForKids-reviews	2005-07-18

This book was on my entering-kindergartener's Summer Reading List but I have to say that it was not our favorite `wordless' book.  Still we did enjoy it and principally I would say this is because of the artwork and the fact that it allowed us to make up our own stories.<br /><br />As the book opens, a young boy is in bed reading a book called \\"Jungles of the World.\\"  As he turns off the light to go to sleep, a faint shadow image of a hare appears outside of his bedroom window.  His cat , which appeared to be dozing, sees the racing figure and stands up.  And on the next  page, vines are silently creeping into the window and the boy is the shadow figure while the jungle outside comes to life.<br /><br />A beautiful tiger fills the next 2 pages, followed by Toucans, monkeys (I'm sorry at the moment I can't think of the type), a stork, crocodile, hippos, gorilla, parrot, elephant, and zebras.  (Lots then to point out to young children.)<br /><br />In the end, the tiger (cat?) and boy circle back on their tracks and see their home.<br /><br />Our cat, Ling, thought that the boy's kitty had slipped into the night and *become*  his inner tiger (LOL).  My daughter thought that the boy was dreaming about a jungle walk.<br /><br />Three and a half Stars.  It's fun to make up your own stories and I think with the artwork and such that this book could easily be appreciated by a baby and toddler, as well as the preschool and up crowd.	2005-07-15

The cars get the better of him though because he hasn't listened to Edwards advice. (A frequent Thomas problem.)<br /><br />In `Thomas Saves the Day' it is poor James' turn to get into trouble with those troublesome trucks. They force him to go off the line. (Wooden brakes, you know). Thomas saves the day by quickly getting the break-down train to the scene, where fortunately James is embarrassed, but unhurt. At the end of this story, James gets new brakes, and Thomas gets his own branch line and Annie and Clarabel.<br /><br />In `Thomas Goes Fishing', we find out that Thomas loves to stop and watch the river, unfortunately fate and his driver seldom allow him to do so. When he meets the other engines he repeats his dissatisfaction and says, \\"I want to fish.\\" But they would all say the same thing in reply: \\"Engines don't go fishing.\\"<br /><br />Trouble comes when Thomas stops at the river station for water and the pump is out of order. His driver and fireman use a bucket to top him off, but unbeknownst to them, they have put fish in Thomas' boiler. Steamie chaos (and a bit of a stink) ensues.<br /><br />In `Terence the Tractor', Thomas gets himself into trouble when he bangs up his much hated snowplow so that he actually can't wear it. And when a heavy snow falls, he gets stuck. Terence comes to the rescue and Thomas finds out that `caterpillar treads' are good things indeed.<br /><br />Four Stars.

(A review of Trouble for Thomas)	Okay, Ringo Starr is not the best narrator, and the pictures are a bit fuzzy and not all that great having been taken from the TV series video tape and enlarged past what their quality would support;  and Thomas (on the cover)  does look like his going to `hurl', but little people just don't seem to care and so we give this book and cassette, Four Stars.<br /><br />There are 4 stories in this collection:<br /><br />Trouble for Thomas<br /><br />Thomas Saves the Day<br /><br />Thomas Goes Fishing<br /><br />Terence the Tractor<br /><br />For those of you who can't remember the plot lines I have summarized them below.<br /><br />In `Trouble for Thomas', kind Edward trades jobs with Thomas so that our favorite Steamie is off to end his boredom by pushing freight cars instead of coaches.  The cars get the better of him though because he hasn't listened to Edwards advice.  (A frequent Thomas problem.)<br /><br />In `Thomas Saves the Day' it is poor James' turn to get into trouble with those troublesome trucks.  They force him to go off the line. (Wooden brakes, you know).  Thomas saves the day by quickly getting the break-down train to the scene, where fortunately James is embarrassed, but unhurt.  At the end of this story, James gets new brakes, and Thomas gets his own branch line and Annie and Clarabel.<br /><br />In `Thomas Goes Fishing', we find out that Thomas loves to stop and watch the river, unfortunately fate and his driver seldom allow him to do so.  When he meets the other engines he repeats his dissatisfaction and says, \\"I want to fish.\\"  But they would all say the same thing in reply:  \\"Engines don't go fishing.\\"<br /><br />Trouble comes when Thomas stops at the river station for water and the pump is out of order.  His driver and fireman use a bucket to top him off, but unbeknownst to them, they have put fish in Thomas' boiler.  Steamie chaos (and a bit of a stink) ensues.<br /><br />In `Terence the Tractor', Thomas gets himself into trouble when he bangs up his much hated snowplow so that he actually can't wear it.  And when a heavy snow falls, he gets stuck.  Terence comes to the rescue and Thomas finds out that `caterpillar treads' are good things indeed.<br /><br />Four Stars.

Arthur gets to be ring bearer and her cousin Cora gets to be flower girl; both because they are older.<br /><br />But fear not, DW gets to save the day when Arthur accidentally looses the ring down an air conditioning vent.

But this is one of those situations in which the PBS video is better than the book.<br /><br />While `Arthur's Baby' is a good story, in book form it fails to *bring home the message* the way that the video does.  In the video, considerable time is spent showing that the baby is comfortable with Arthur's holding her, and that Arthur has some `basic' baby knowledge that D.W. just can't have because she is so much younger.<br /><br />The book text just doesn't get this across.  The baby begins to cry and in 8 lines after Arthur picks up Kate, the story comes to a conclusion with an unceremonious burp.<br /><br />Three Stars.  Okay book, but if you will have to explain the message to all but the most adroit kids.	2005-07-14

I gave my son and daughter some large dots and we had fun experimenting with what we could make out of them.<br /><br />However, art is not my reason for giving a thumbs up to this book.  I like its math side.<br /><br />For toddlers there is counting.  And for older children (I would say preschool age) there is an chart at the end of the book which shows dots and numbers from 1 to 5 on the first page and 6 to 10 on the next two  pages (only 5 dots fit per page).  Having the numbers and dots shown in this manner is a marvelous way to let little ones see the `ladder' shape of the number pyramid.  And an opportunity to point out how moving up or down the stairs is equivalent to addition and subtraction.<br /><br />We like this book.  It has a cute concept that is appealing to young children.

The text is displayed within the pictures which are too complicated (in my opinion) for babies or even toddlers.  There are fairies and angels, dragons (cheerful) and firebirds.  And while the imagery is not simple, one would probably also not call it lavish.  If you are familiar with Paul O. Zelinsky's work, it is not that nice.<br /><br />Three to Four Stars.

Mr. Asch's books are inevitably wonderful, with simple, delightful illustrations and gentle stories.<br /><br />This book is a little different however in that it shows puppies being born.  Well, to be honest, the illustrations are not exactly graphic and my two children (boy and girl; 3 and 5) certainly didn't 'grasp' that the puppies were coming out of the mommy dog.  A fact, which allows me (and you) the opportunity to point this out, or not.<br /><br />Personally, I plan to point this out at a latter time.<br /><br />But in any case, this is a wonderful book about a puppy who happens to be last in doing many things.  He is last to be borne, the last to eat and open his eyes, and the last to learn to drink from a saucer.  He is even the last one in the doghouse at night.<br /><br />None of these things seem to matter though until it comes time to find a new home.  The last puppy becomes distressed when he is constantly not chosen by visitors.  And then one day, a little boy comes and gets him.  He laughs and says, \\"You know what?  You're my first puppy.\\"<br /><br />Five Stars.

Despite a healthier and bigger meal plan with exercise, Bird doesn't get any bigger.  So what will Bear do to fulfil his part of the bargain?<br /><br />Give up?  Bear gives Little Bird a pumpkin seed and teaches him how to plant it and care for it.  When the pumpkin fruits, Bear cleverly etches a picture of LB on the skin, so that when the pumpkin is finally huge and orange, LB *is* bigger (by proxy-LOL).<br /><br />[As a side note:  I love that Asch draws pictures of the seed as is sprouts, grows roots, and changes from its false-leaves to real ones.]<br /><br />But then there is the problem of how Bear is going to fly.

I liked 'A Huge Hog is a Big Pig', but I have to admit that my kids (the other is 3) just didn't get it...yet.<br /><br />They did, however, *get* this book.  Mostly because I think the humor is pictorial.  In this book, readers are shown a pair of pictures.  The first one shows a familiar scene but something in it is goofy.  For example, in a diner a boy is combing his fries while his mom is pouring ketchup on his hair.  Hilarious--from a kid's point of view.<br /><br />On the next page, the same scene is shown but this time everything is as it should be.<br /><br />Four stars.

And she looks behind an orange in one of many in a bucket. \\"Not in here,\\" replies a fat green caterpillar.<br /><br />She then looks behind a teddy-bear, under a straw hat, behind a tennis shoe, until she finds them all safe in a big basket under a blanket.<br /><br />My children loved lifting the flaps.

(Picture Knight)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A Good Book for Older Children	I can't say that I have ever read a children's book quite like this one.  It has a depth of thought and plot that you just don't see in most children's books.<br /><br />The story line is pretty well explained by the \\"School Library Journal\\" reviewer in the Editorial Review section so I won't rehash it.  However, what they don't tell you is that there are two pages towards the end of the book on which the angry mice's desires are illustrated (though thankfully not acted out).<br /><br />Because they have not heard all of Nicholas' story, the angry mice envision chasing the birds with pointed sticks and hurting them.  It is very poignant and both my husband and I were at first shocked to see the images.<br /><br />Thankfully, our children (5 and 3) hadn't a clue as to what was happening except that the birds were being 'scared off' by the mice.<br /><br />So why, with our obvious reservations, did I give this book 5 stars?  Principally, because the message of tolerance is important.  As is the message that you should wait to hear 'all of a story' before drawing a conclusion.<br /><br />My children are young and sheltered.  My 3 year old thought that the mice were 'painting' the one bird with red paint.  However, this is a book that I think is more than appropriate for older children and we will keep it to provide the valuable lessons that it can teach.<br /><br />Five stars.  Can be read to young children, but contains violent images.<br /><br />Note:  Leo Lionni was on my entering Kindergartener's Summer Reading List and most of his works are non-controversial.	2005-07-05

This is a nice, playful little book BUT HONESTLY I can't imagine reading it to my five year-old, much less an eight year-old.  I truly think the age range would be better if it said:  from 5 months to 3 years of age.<br /><br />In this book, Dora and Boots are playing Hide and Seek and when they were little, my two loved it.  (They are 3 and 5 now).  The fun part of the plot was that you are looking for Boot's red boots and behind each flap (1 flap per every 2 pages) is something red.  Is it Boots?  No, it's red but it is a flower.  Or  a ball... or King Crab....  My kids loved that it wasn't Boots but something else.<br /><br />As children get slightly older you can spruce up the action by introducing a few of the 11 Spanish words that are listed.<br /><br />A pronunciation guide for the Spanish vocabulary is in the front.  The words follow: Hola, Una, Flor, Roja, Pelota, Mariposa, Un, Sombrero, Rojo, Lo hicimos, Adios.  (Nothing intimidating here.)<br /><br />Five Stars.

Animals contained therein: Squirrel, owl, bat, dragonfly, grasshopper, fox, frog, snake, deer, swan and badger. (Yes, a badger!)<br /><br />Every animal except two appear on their own pages. The fox and the deer each cover two pages. The drawings are simple, strong and stylized. You might say they look `country', or you might say that they were drawn by a talented child.

Everyone Else Loves It But Us :-(	This is a nice story and I thoroughly enjoyed it but I have to say that my two children (3 and 5) did not.<br /><br />I think what kept them from appreciating this book was that it was a) a bit long, and b) a little over their heads.  Certainly for an Eric Carle book there is alot of text.  Some pages having over 75 words.<br /><br />Now, certainly we are talking about two children out of the many described here, so I wouldn't necessarily be discouraged from buying this book if your kids can sit down for a fairly long read.  But from our point of view (which is the purpose of a review afterall) we will have to wait until later to enjoy \\"A House for Hermit Crab\\".<br /><br />Three stars.  Long with esoteric content.	2005-07-01

We love everything Thomas, and to be truthful my son gives this a thumbs-up, but I think it's a little sub-par for most Thomas books.<br /><br />As noted by a previous reviewer, the artwork is very simplistic and unlike many other Thomas books there is nothing noteworthy in the background to talk about with your young Thomas fan.<br /><br />In this story, Henry is not feeling well, and Thomas has been made to feel unimportant by Gordon and James.  Still, Thomas tells Henry that he will go and get 'special' coal for him so that he can feel better.<br /><br />In the process of obtaining this coal, Thomas stumbles across the *Magic Railroad*.  Percy tells Thomas all about the legend.  \\"The engines had heard of the legend of the Magic Railroad and of the beautiful golden engine called Lady, who gave the railroad its magic power.  Lady had disappeared long ago, and the Magic Railroad had disappeared with her.\\"<br /><br />Thomas overcomes his fears, enters the boundary to wherever it is that Lady has been and brings her back to Sodor.<br /><br />Now all of this would be fine and dandy for me, except for the way that they draw Lady--which is nothing like the nice picture they have of her on the front cover.  Honesty, it is just a little weird.  Unlike all of the other Steamies, she is portrayed as staring blankly off into the distance.  Zombie-like.  Whites showing equally, all around her pupils.<br /><br />Two Stars.  Print too small for young children to read.  Drawings very simplistic and uninteresting.  And Lady, just a little out-of-it.	2005-07-01

HOWEVER, we did not particularly care for this particular book.<br /><br />While the illustrations are lovely and classic Asch, the book did not engross us the way that his other books have.<br /><br />The story is a sort of version of Country Mouse/City Mouse.  A baby deer (separated from his mother by wolves) persuades a calf to spend the day with him.  After tasting delicious apples from a wild apple tree, the calf tells the deer that they are almost as good as oats.  The deer then goes into the 'civilized' grounds of the calf's farm.<br /><br />Like in Country Mouse/City Mouse nothing is resolved except that each animal decides that they like their native habitat best.<br /><br />Three stars.  Good artwork, but story was average.	2005-07-01

Unlike the previous reviewer (below) I really liked this book.  (And of course, my son loves it.)<br /><br />James and the Red Balloon<br /><br />Thomas is excited about this new method of transportation, but he begins to be worried about being replaced when James expresses his concern.<br /><br />James inadvertently ends up saving the balloon when it runs out of air; and the balloon ends up bringing more business for the Steamies.<br /><br />--I used this as a learning time by pointing out that if is best to wait and get facts about a situation before going off half-cocked.<br /><br />Harvey to the Rescue<br /><br />--I simply love this story.  First it is hard not to love this lantern-jawed strong man (eh...engine).  I also like that Thomas is so kind and considerate in this story (unlike some others in which I'd like to put him into time-out.LOL)<br /><br />Harvey is new and strange and the Steamies are not all that nice.  Harvey is saddened by their lack of friendliness; but Thomas wisely points out that sometimes it takes time to make new friends.<br /><br />And sure enough, the crew comes around after Harvey does his stuff and saves Percy.  They find out that different is good.<br /><br />Thomas and the Jet Engine<br /><br />--I don't know if there is some message here that can be used for teaching.  In my opinion, this story is just about silliness.  If  Lucy (from \\"I Love Lucy\\" TV show) had been a train, this would no doubt have been an episode.<br /><br />Perhaps it was written simply to give little Thomas his wish of, for once, being the fastest train on Sodor.  Sort of an empowerment statement for young kids.<br /><br />Five Stars.  Two good learning opportunities (imho), plus some classic Sodor silliness.	2005-06-29

Paul Galdone was on my entering Kindergartener's Summer Reading List and we can certainly understand why.  Even in this tale that is not our favorite, we can enjoy his amusing drawings.<br /><br />In the story Fox counts on curiosity to further his greedy aims.  He visits four women in a row and each time none of the women can keep their promise to not look in the bag.  The last woman at least has a reason to open the bag: there is a little boy inside!<br /><br />Fox gets his comeuppance when the last lady replaces the boy with her fierce bulldog.<br /><br />I thought that perhaps the image of the boy in the sack would upset my children (3 and 5; boy and girl) but they were unmoved and unconcerned.<br /><br />Three to four stars.  The artwork is classic Galdone.  The tale is a classic too.  The rating difference stems from differences of opinion about the actual story.	2005-06-29

Poor Trevor is described as a \\"Tractor Engine\\".  How ridiculous.  Trevor is a \\"Traction\\" engine.  Ok...I feel better now. LOL.<br /><br />In any case... we love these little books.  Despite what the recommended age ranges suggest they a good for younger Thomas lovers as well. The drawings are colorful and the stories are fun and amusing; and as the previous reviewer has noted, young children can 'read' this themselves after a few times through.<br /><br />\\"Step 2\\" refers to the Preschool through Grade 1 reading range, which means \\"Reading with Help\\".  Sentences are short with 'basic vocabulary'.<br /><br />An example from the book:<br /><br />\\"Bees are very loud!\\" said James.<br /><br />\\"Do not make them mad,\\" said Trevor.  \\"They may sting you!\\"<br /><br />\\"Hmmmph!\\" said James.  \\"I am not scared of a bunch of bees!\\"<br /><br />James puffed off.<br /><br />Hopefully the above will help you gage whether this book is appropriate for your child.  My suggestion though would be to get the book anyway.  If they can't read it now, they will be able to in the future.<br /><br />Five stars.  One of the Classic Thomas Stories.	2005-06-29

Mr. Galdone is a consummate illustrator who has a real talent for drawing the facial expressions of people and non-people alike.<br /><br />Mr. Galdone also pulls no punches.  When he does a translation, he cuts nothing out, and so far we have found all of his tales very close to the originals.  Thus, in \\"Puss in Boots\\", you will find that Puss eats the Giant --after he becomes a mouse, of course.  Also, Puss threatens the haymakers with violence to gain his ends:  \\"When the King drives past and asks to whom this field belongs, you must reply, `To the Marquis of Carabas.'  If you don't, I shall chop you fine as mincemeat.\\"<br /><br />Despite the fact that violence is one of the things banned from our house, I have found that my children (3 and 5) don't seem to take much notice of the threat, nor do they seem disturbed by giant's consumption.<br /><br />Four stars.  Classic art style.  Classic story.  Minus one for violence.<br /><br />Note:  If considering purchasing, take a look at the Cassette and Book edition put out by Clarion.  I have not heard the narration, but there are sample pictures of the artwork shown there.	2005-06-28

In fact, these same reviews appear on the pages for the \\"Fred Marcellino\\" illustrated version.<br /><br />Next I am going to say that I did not purchase this particular edition.  I did not get the cassette and have not heard the narration.<br /><br />I am reviewing this though because my children (3 and 5) are really into cassette readings at this moment and so I would sincerely suggest that you try this version of \\"Puss in Boots\\" if you haven't tried cassettes previously.<br /><br />As for this book, we really enjoyed it.  I had completely forgotten much of how the tale unfolded until we ran across this on my entering Kindergartner's Summer Reading List.<br /><br />What you will find in this story is the classic tale of how a cat helps a bumpkin to become a prince.  You will also find that Mr. Galdone pulls no punches in his retelling.  When he does a translation, he cuts nothing out.<br /><br />Thus, in \\"Puss in Boots\\", you will find that Puss eats the Giant --after he becomes a mouse, of course.  And that Puss lies and carries on in a non-PC manner.  He kills wild game and threatens haymakers with violence.<br /><br />He says:  \\"When the King drives past and asks to whom this field belongs, you must reply, `To the Marquis of Carabas.'  If you don't, I shall chop you fine as mincemeat.\\"<br /><br />Despite the fact that violence is one of the things banned from our house, I have found that my children (3 and 5) don't seem to take much notice of the threat, nor do they seem disturbed by giant's consumption.<br /><br />Four stars.

They are inexpensive and just the right treat for the little Thomas lovers in the household.<br /><br />Ours books were sitting on the steps when we came home.  My children (boy and girl--three and five) couldn't wait to open the box and kept bugging me to stop making lunch and read to them, Pleeeaaase!  (I mean what more can a Mom want.  Children begging to be read to!)<br /><br />In any case, Ms. Audrey-the-Librarian (below) outlines the story fairly well.  Poor Percy sees the parade dragon and the usual sort of Thomas silliness ensues.<br /><br />As to this books being a primer... I am not at all sure I agree that this book is for preschoolers and kindergarteners:  Step I.  My daughter is going into school in the fall and I doubt she would get far in this book.<br /><br />It is a shame that they don't have any sample pages to peruse so you could see for yourself what the language is like; but some of the words included are:  Thomas, Percy, Sir Topham Hatt, parade, dragon, night, tomorrow, thinking, rumble, scary, brave, cries, shut, next....<br /><br />Sample text:<br /><br />\\"Percy hears a rumble.<br /><br />Something is coming.<br /><br />Percy opens his eyes.\\"<br /><br />Despite these reservations, obviously most children will eventually be able to read this cute story for themselves, and before that time there is always we caregivers, so we give \\"Thomas and Percy and the Dragon\\" 5 stars.	2005-06-28

At one such time, the daughter goes into the woods, as she often does, looking for nuts and berries.<br /><br />Finding nothing, she collapses in tears onto a log, only to be jarred from her fretting state by an old hag with a \\"pleasant but crackly voice.\\"  The old woman tells her not to worry, that she won't be hungry ever again, and offers up a small black pot.  Just tell the pot `Boil, Little Pot, Boil' and at once it will fill up with delicious porridge.\\"  To stop the pot there are other words.<br /><br />If you don't see it coming, chaos ensues when the mother forgets the words for making the pot stop which results in the whole town filling with delectable porridge.<br /><br />The story ends with the other villagers emptying out into the street with buckets and bowls and what-not to fill up with the food.  There was enough for days.<br /><br />Five Stars.  It is a delightful story with cute Galdone drawings.  A great addition to the home library.	2005-06-28

What can I say; without Ms. Hillert's books my just-turned 5 year old would still not be reading.  (Not that she is *all that* advanced, but she can read these pre-primer books)<br /><br />I credit her reading to Ms. Hillert and her collection.  We tried Dick and Jane, but despite my favorable memories of that series, my daughter found them boring and we made zero progress.  Margaret Hillert's stories though were an immediate hit.<br /><br />The story in this book is about how a dad helps his son to build a dog house for 'Little Red', but not before the dog and his friend try several unsuccessful attempts with baskets and boxes.<br /><br />Sample text follows:<br /><br />\\"Father, Father.<br /><br />Can you make a house?<br /><br />Can you make a house for Little Red?\\"<br /><br />\\"I can. I can.<br /><br />Come and see.<br /><br />I can work.<br /><br />You can help me.\\"<br /><br />According to the back of the book there are 49 pre-primer words in this story including: something, one, two, three, cookie, to, me, run, want, play,... etc.<br /><br />Four stars.  Good primer, but for us not as interesting as the books that retell the classic fairytales.

Using pictures from the television series, it tells the tale of Trevor the Traction Engine and how he proves to be a truly useful engine -- even though he does not run on rails!<br /><br />The book begins with a few sentences about how Edward (No. 2) saved Trevor from the scrap heap, and how their friendship continues to this day.<br /><br />Trevor now works at the vicarage orchard but at the moment he is lamenting that there is not much work to do.  Edward then tells his friend that Sir Topham Hatt has requested his assistance at the new harbor.<br /><br />Thomas meets Trevor when he is sent to bring this new Steamie to the new harbor.  Thomas has never seen a traction engine and is puzzled by the fact that Trevor doesn't run on rails.<br /><br />Trevor shows his usefulness though at the docks where all is in confusion.  But as much fun as Trevor has *saving the day*, his favorite part of the work is when he gets to give rides to the children.<br /><br />A sweet book that ends with Trevor sleepily remembering his busy time at the new harbor, and all of his new friends.  This sleepy, quiet ending makes this book is a good one for bedtime.  And what more can you say in favor of a Steamie than that Annie and Clarabel like him!<br /><br />Great book... my son loves it and so do I.	2005-06-20

And I found it really useful as a learning tool too.<br /><br />While other versions just have the repetitive print \\"Not I\\" standing on it's own, the Galdone version has a picture of each animal next to the words.

The first story is \\"The Fox and the Grapes\\"; the second is the \\"The Fox and the Stork\\"; and the last is \\"The Fox and the Crow\\".<br /><br />The artwork is typical of Galdone.  The writing is sparse without being Spartan, and if I am not mistaken, this book was originally published as one of the 'Weekly Reader Children's Book Club' books, so that it is simple by design.<br /><br />Though I am by no means an expert at saying what age levels are appropriate for this book, I would think that a second or third grader would do alright reading this on their own.<br /><br />Whether they can understand the morals that Aesop, that ancient sage of Phrygia, was trying to get across is going to depend upon their sophistication.  Galdone actually tells the reader what the moral is at the end of each story, but *real* comprehension may take years.<br /><br />I'm not at all sure my 5 year-old comprehends, but I did want to expose my children to the classics and if they don't understand it now, no doubt, they will later.<br /><br />Surprisingly, my 3 year-old really likes this book.  He asks for it at least once a day and most likely it is the artwork that attracts him.  Galdone has a wonderful way of drawing expressions.<br /><br />A good addition to the home library.<br /><br />Five stars for artwork and serving double duty as an introduction to Aesop as well as being a beginning reader.	2005-06-20

What a tome!  493 pages of trees and shrubs which manages-- only just barely-- to not be overwhelming.<br /><br />The book begins, of course, with a Table of Contents which lists Woody plants by scientific name. (While this is not something that is at all useful to an amateur like me, there is an Index in the back which allows the novice to look up most trees by their common name.)<br /><br />Following the Contents, is the Preface which draws attention to the importance of the pictures in casting judgement on a plant.  It is noted that all of the pictures were taken by the author over the 25 years he has been studying plants.<br /><br />Following the acknowledgements are the trees and shrubs themselves in alphabetical, Latin, order.  Along with any pictures of the is a brief paragraph which includes useful descriptions of habit, foliage characteristics, flowers and fruit (if any), bark, culture, possible landscape use, size, zones, and native habitat.  Sometimes interesting cultivars are shown.<br /><br />That said, without Part II of the encyclopedia, I would have been overwhelmed.  Part II is plant magic.  It focuses on \\"Selecting Plants for Specific Characteristics or Purposes\\".  Besides having plant indices listed by common name and scientific names, it has charts that aid the homeowner (or other) to select trees or shrubs by `design' and `cultural' characteristics.<br /><br />A great reference book, well worth the price for those looking to find just the right landscaping specimens.	2005-06-14

Monster Toddler is unconcerned with the fleeing Charlotte and continues on his rampage until he makes a mess *so big* that he becomes stuck behind a big pile of disheveled toys and books.<br /><br />But never fear, \\"WONDER Charlotte\\" comes to the rescue.  And after she shows Monster Toddler how to clean up the house, how to sit quietly and not pop out and surprise people, and how to be nice to kitty, Timothy decides that he likes being good.  He even agrees to relinquish his monster suit.<br /><br />This is such a delightful story.  Not only is the artwork fun and sweet, the plot appeals to children on a number of levels.  First, who doesn't occasionally dream of happily running amuck:  raiding the refrigerator and eating all the cake.  Plus, what sibling doesn't occasionally `bug' their siblings?  And what big brother or sister doesn't dream of being a super hero.<br /><br />Perhaps it is the versatility of this story that keeps my children (3 and 5) coming back for more.  They love this book and with its fun artwork and gentle ways and I love it too.<br /><br />It is definitely a book that has already kept their attention for years (we started reading this when they were 1 and 3 and we feel its a great addition to any kid's library.	2005-06-14

The idea of traveling by rocket and that fact that the moon is *very far* away is not all that understandable to most small children (at least not to mine who are 3 and 5).  Mine can't even comprehend why we can't drive to Florida to visit relatives *today*.<br /><br />Also, my children were clueless as to a) what a rocket was and b) what it could do, even with my explanation.<br /><br />Then there is the notion of `hibernation'.  While this exact word does not appear in the text, the author does say that \\"... instead of climbing into bed and sleeping through the winter, he kept right on working\\".  My 5 year-old grasps the significance of bear's action, but I am sure my 3-year-old doesn't.<br /><br />Three Stars.  Nice story.  Attractively illustrated.  However, this Frank Asch books fails to win top points because there are concepts in this book that ruin the story for many young children because they 'just don't get it'.	2005-06-14

Paul Galdone's \\"Three Little Pigs\\" is not your modern PC version of piggies vs wolf.  In this story pigs get eaten.  Which is perhaps why this book was on my entering kindergartner's Summer Reading List.  Far from being watered down and shortened, this version includes the bits about the wolf's trying to trick pig #3 into getting within grabbing range:  let's get turnips together... apples together, and finally, let's go to the fair together.<br /><br />It also has the wolf becoming so enraged that he forgets how well this little piggy has consistently outwitted him.  Angrily, he crawls down the chimney only to become the pig's dinner.<br /><br />Thus, all of the `morality play' aspects of the story remain.  Now whether a young child can shift through the material to garner those gems depends upon the child.  My approach is if not now, then later.<br /><br />Interestingly, one of the things that I found was that my children -boy and girl, 3 and 5 respectively-were unconcerned with the fate of the `less wary' pigs.  At this point in time, they simply do not appear to identify with the porcine characters and consequently did not find the story scary or disturbing.<br /><br />Buy this book if you want the classic story.  It is longer, but for toddlers you can simply skip over the extra attempts of the wolf to trick the 3rd piggy, and go to the chimney directly.	2005-06-09

This last is the one addition that Galdone makes: a more personable approach to the fox.  He was only feeding his family.<br /><br />Henny Penny is an old classic fairytale.  Like many old tales it contains lessons and opportunities to teach.  Besides the lesson that one ought not to take things at face value, all of the names (Loxy Foxy, Goosey Loosey, etc.) rhyme which give the beginning reader the opportunity to see that names that are spelt similarly, sound similarly.<br /><br />Buy this if you want the classic version for your child's library.	2005-06-09

Let me begin by saying they have got the age range wrong.  I think any child 5 and under would enjoy this book.  (My eldest just turned 5 and she certainly likes it.)  The artwork is colorful and pleasant and as you turn the pages the pictures become increasingly dense with added characters and action.  Certainly there is enough activity to keep older children occupied.  And because of the repetitiveness they might even *read* it themselves.<br /><br />We adore this book.  It has humor and warmth and it extends the old short rhyme with an even better story.  In this version, Little Miss Muffett's spider doesn't chase her away, instead he asks her to stay.  Then come lemurs with streamers, magpies with bowties, foxes with boxes, pussycats with partyhats, poodles with oodles of noodles, bears with chairs, puffins with muffins, gibbons with ribbons and crocodiles with 10 greedy smiles.  But to what end?  Surprise! It's a birthday party.<br /><br />There is so much to this book.  It teaches counting and rhyming.  It introduces animals that are not typical in young children's' reading: puffins, lemurs and gibbons.  For my children, it elicited in them the desire to memorize the poem (it was so much fun).  To me this indicates that they are learning to love literature and reading.<br /><br />I think it would make a great birthday gift, but don't buy it just for that.  Think of all that your child could learn.	2005-06-07

The pictures are large and friendly and attractive, and there are alot of interesting things to point out and talk about;  but unlike the children of the other reviewers, mine did not find this book engrossing.<br /><br />I think the principle reason for this is the rhyme.  We read alot of poetry (son and daughter, 3 and 5 respectively) and I think the not quite free-verse style of this author threw them off.<br /><br />For example, at one point the rhyming words are ... bank/yank...<br /><br />sack/back...(so far, okay)... and then truck/money.  Hmmm.<br /><br />I am going to try to overcome this by just leaving off the last two lines of every paragraph (the truck/money part) and see how it goes.

[For a more comprehensive list check out \\"Dirr's Hardy Trees and Shrubs\\" by Michael Dirr.]<br /><br />Featured cultivars are said to be easily attainable at local nurseries and other plant suppliers.<br /><br />Text descriptions include size (most of the specimens grow to a height of less than 33 feet, with many considerably smaller), hardiness, climate and soil specifications, pests and diseases, invasiveness and toxicity (of concern for those of us who like children and pets.)  In addition there is something described as `aspect' by which I understand the author to mean environmental preference such as whether the plant likes to be sheltered.<br /><br />There is a section on \\"Finding and Selecting Trees\\" and, of course, one on how to plant trees.  All of these introductory discourses are then followed by the \\"Directory of Trees\\" itself.  Each plant has 2 pages of photos.  These lovely pictures show, when appropriate, features of the tree, such as what it looks like in bloom, or in winter.  If the bark is of interest this also will be depicted so that there is no doubt what your tree will look like.<br /><br />Each tree also has a \\"factfinder\\" block of data which states maximum height, hardiness, aspect, soil type, soil pH, and country of origin.<br /><br />At the end of the book is a \\"Tree Selector\\" chart which lists each tree again with the following data:<br /><br />Tolerance of ...<br /><br />-- heavy clay soils<br /><br />-- alkaline soils<br /><br />-- poorly draining soils<br /><br />-- dry soil<br /><br />-- salt spray<br /><br />-- exposure<br /><br />-- extreme cold<br /><br />Also whether the tree is evergreen, compact, flowered (in season), has foliage of interest, interesting fall color, attractive bark and winter interest.<br /><br />Nicely done, this manageably sized book is a good guide for the homeuser.  The only drawback I found (for me at least) in this and in nearly every other every tree and shrub tomb, is that the authors ONLY refer to plants by their Latin names.  Unlike some books, however, this one at least allows you to look up the common names in the index so that one does not need to know that a Black Locust is scientifically known as `Robinia pseudoacacia'.sized book is a good guide for the homeuser.

This is a train book.  Most importantly it is a Thomas the Tank Engine book and to a 3 year old's eyes, nothing is as exciting as a race between two of his steamy friends:  little Thomas and mighty Gordon.<br /><br />While others have noted that the race ends with Thomas winning through trickery,  I like to think of it as Thomas winning by *thinking* rather than shear brawn.  (What kind of a `real' race is it anyway between a huge steamy and little ole Thomas?  Gordon might as well have been racing Toby the steam tram.)<br /><br />As far as the text is concerned, the rhyme is, as noted elsewhere, awkward.  I believe the author would have been better off using 54+ words to get better verse, but I guess that did not fit into the magic scheme of 50.<br /><br />What does work is the `catch me, catch me, go, go, go\\" action-rhythm and the nicely drawn pictures.

The first story is about Percy's misadventures during a water shortage.  He tries to stay clean but ends up the dirtiest he's probably ever been.  And children just seem to love the idea of Percy's being covered with chocolate.  The second story is called Salty's Secret and is about how well Salty relates to those troublesome trucks.  Hint:  \\"Yo ho ho and a bucket of prawns, the tiller spins and the captain yawns.\\"<br /><br />The final story tells how Percy and Harold become friends though at first it seems as if just the opposite is about to happen as Harold starts to take the mail delivery over from the stranded Percy.<br /><br />This little book with its tape is an excellent way to both increase listening skills and practice `reading' a book.

Written by the legendary Frank Asch this charming book has captured my kids' hearts.  Okay, and mine too.<br /><br />*Goodnight Horsey* is the story of a little girl who, in the process of going to bed one night, changes the usual order of things --water, story, kiss, lights out-- and asks her father to give her a \\"horsey ride\\".<br /><br />Her father then, page by page, changes into a horse while she becomes an Indian Princess.  First dad's hands and feet become hooves.  Then his ears grow long and he grows a tail and mane eventually becoming a horse retaining only his good nature and glasses.<br /><br />Giddyap, the princess says, they ride \\"as fast as the wind\\". It is lovely how various pieces of furniture are changed into elements in woods as they play.<br /><br />When the little girl finally hears that it is time for bed everything begins to convert back.  Her dad, still partially a horse, brings her the usual cup of water and begins to read her a goodnight story.  But this time instead of her dad giving her a kiss, he falls asleep (worn out one assumes and the little girl gets the opportunity to take care of him.  She pulls a blanket off her bed, covers her father with it and gives him a kiss.  Goodnight, she says to her slumbering dad.<br /><br />A charmingly sweet bedtime story.	2005-06-02

As a mom of two emerging readers (one 3, one 5) I have done alot of research into how children learn to read and this summer I am in hot pursuit of books that will help them practice.<br /><br />One of the key skills that appears over and over in the literature is the ability to get 'clues' as to what is going on in the story from the pictures that accompany the text.  This is one of the reasons I like this book.  Without words, it allows my youngsters to practice their pre-reading skills of analyzing and interpreting what pictures mean.<br /><br />The other reason, of course, is that this book is simply delightful.

That said, my children and I don't get what all the hoop-la is about.  Sure, the pictures have that artistic 'grittiness' that one often sees in photos hung in galleries, but really, how many young children find that style appealing!?!<br /><br />In particular, in this book (as compared to Toban's &#34;Dig-Drill, Dump-Fill&#34;) the photographs don't even seem that inspired.  The cat lying on the car hood is just that; a tabby on car's hood.<br /><br />Two stars- Some pictures are interesting but definitely take a look at it in the Library before purchasing.	2005-05-27

(See note below.)<br /><br />One of the key skills that appears over and over in the literature is the ability to get 'clues' as to what is going on in the story from the pictures that accompany the text.<br /><br />This is one of the reasons I give this wordless book by Tomie dePaola five stars. It gives children the opportunity to practice their skills at `interpreting' and analyzing pictures.  The first reason, of course, is that this book is so much fun. The drawings are expressive and funny and my kids can't seem to get enough of this wonderful story about a woman in hot pursuit of delicious pancakes.<br /><br />[Also good are Mercer Meyer's wordless books.]	2005-05-27

Using watercolor style drawings and simple text it reminds parents, and teaches young children, that 'machines' come in a variety of forms and that some machines use gas to fuel them while others use food.<br /><br />Equipment shown includes: construction equipment, a simple lever, a child's wagon, pulleys and gears (block and tackle), a jackscrew, bicycle sprocket, car, sewing machine, old fashioned hand blender, bicycle, typewriter, clock, fan, skate, vacuum cleaner and more.<br /><br />Generally nice, the only drawbacks for very young children are that they will not have a clue as to what gears are.

They obviously loved the experience because they were inspired to produce this Caldecott winner.<br /><br />Though the book was written with African-American children in mind, I believe all children can benefit from reading it.  Each number is accompanied by a two-page grayscale drawing.  The lack of color may be a problem for younger readers.  My 3 year-old son, for example, was not interested in a second read-through.  My 5 year-old daughter however was intrigued by how African culture (grantedly of the late 1960's) was different from our own.  The counting was not of particular interest to us but all of the other aspects of non-urban African life were.<br /><br />Pictures depicted are snowy Kilimanjaro, a children's game called Mankala, coffee trees, mothers carrying their babies on their backs (which we now do in the US), savanna animals, styles of dress, Nile river fish, busy market stalls, musicians and their instruments, and, at last, a storyteller entrancing young listeners.<br /><br />My only complaint is that there is not more to this book: more beautiful drawings; and more explanations of the activities that are depicted.  Still a nice book for children who seek an introduction to the broader world.	2005-05-24

I agree however with 2 previous reviewers that there are some illustrations missing and that the wording is cumbersome to read outloud.<br /><br />By missing illustrations, we mean that not every picture of the trilogy of bowls, chairs, and beds (big, medium, little) is shown and I think this makes it difficult for small children to follow.  This oversight seems particularly odd considering that Ms. Brett could have included the missing actions in the usual side-bar pictures that she is renown for.<br /><br />Also problematic (but overcome by the patient parent) is the cumbersome wording that refers to the bears not as momma, pappa, and baby bear, but \\"great, huge bear\\", \\"middle-sized bear\\", and \\"little, small wee bear\\".  Perhaps it parallels the original telling of the story, but to me and at least one other parent, it made if hard to read outloud.<br /><br />That said, my children (3 and 5; boy and girl) give this a definite thumbs up as an excellent addition to your bookshelves.	2005-05-24

Everyone else seems to adore this book so I guess I have lost my sense of humor because I just don't like this particular version-- at least not for the 3 and under set.<br /><br />My first objection stems from the use of bug spray by the 'old lady' to get rid of the fly.  She is shown sitting on a couch surrounded by cans of depleted insecticide while spraying more in her mouth.  Rather than find this funny, it scared me to think that some child might get a notion to copy this activity.<br /><br />Then second is my objection to boiling a cat and chasing a dog with the same intent.  Now most children wouldn't do this so that's not a problem but I still don't like the idea of introducing this weird concept to my little boy.  (My son asked me if we needed to keep our cat inside and safe from the neighbors - hmmm.)<br /><br />The funny part of all of this is that I don't mind when the old lady just pops the animals down her throat.  Go figure.  In any case, Nadine Westcott is a good story teller and her artwork is clever, but I still have to give this book two stars because of the above reservations.<br /><br />[A `Thought You Should Know' review]	2005-05-23

(There is text at the end which describes what the equipment is called and what it does.)  When she found it of no interest past the second reading I was not surprised--she is sort of a 5 y.o. girlie-girl.<br /><br />However, my 3 y.o. son didn't like it either.  After he found out what the equipment did, he lost interest and went back to playing with Thomas and Friends.<br /><br />That said, the photos are striking and gritty and I can see where some children would be attracted to this book.

It is a nicely photographed book but not one I would think appropriate for anyone over 3 years of age.  Certainly my boy and girl,  newly 3 and 5 respectively, were uninteresting in it.<br /><br />Perhaps this is because they are already familiar with these animals (kodiak bear, penguin, hippo, zebra, polar bear, sea lion, lion, parrot, elephant, panda, and giraffe) and found nothing new about the presentation.

The pictures are colorful and interesting and would hold a young child's attention.  I, myself, particularly like that they have a wheelchair as one of the ways to transport oneself.<br /><br />However, this is supposed to be a beginning reader.  The publishers'/author's themselves say that the Level A books are \\"for emergent readers...\\" with sentences that are short and simple-- which is true.  Many of the pages have just one word:  Boat, train, skates, wagon, bus, etc.<br /><br />The problem with this approach, however, is that a single word is not a complete sentence and the words they have chosen to illustrate are not ones that a beginning reader is likely to encounter again in the near future.  Thus, if they learn these difficult words they will not have any practice to reinforce that knowledge.<br /><br />Summary:  Though this book is not a good beginning reader, it might be okay for a baby or toddler that likes the idea of `going'.  For a better reader try the Margaret Hillert series which are based on commonly known fairytales such as Tom Thumb.  Or, of course, there is Dick and Jane.<br /><br />Pam T~	2005-05-14

I see that there has been a great deal written pro and con about this book.  Let me then say just a little more in its favor as well as say why I am buying a second book for my family.<br /><br />In its favor:  We have quite a few baby/toddler/preschooler books on our shelves but this remains one of my favorites for the first year.  The main reason is it's readability.  It is easy to read and reread-which is something first-time moms tend to do (or at least it's what I did).  In particular, I was absorbed by the milestones; alternately pleased or concerned as the months came and went.  But what fun to be able enjoy this new aspect of life with my babies.<br /><br />Book 2 Project:  One of things I did as the months passed was to write down when my children reached their milestones.  I am buying another book in order to copy my remarks so that I will have one to give to each of my children so that when they have their own babies they can compare and contrast their children's development with what is written in their personal books.<br /><br />Summary: not all of the information in What to Expect is without controversy.  Personally, I don't think that there is anything wrong with the family bed and extended breast feeding.  We did one but not the other.  In any case, my advice would be to not let any single book be your only source of information.  Read, read, read.  Go to the library with your newborn.  A good habit to develop for later on.  Include a healthy dose of Brazelton, Sears, Leach and even Spock in your diet.<br /><br />And don't be afraid to add this excellent book to your shelves.<br /><br />Pam T~	2005-05-12

My take is a little different however.  As a mom with two young children (38 months and almost 5) I am constantly looking for books of all sorts to read to them.  I particularly like books that my kids love enough to memorize on their own.<br /><br />In this light, Drummer Hoff is a complete hit.  The drawings are so intense and interesting that my son brings the book to me all the time... or did.  Now that we all know it by heart we take turns reciting it as we play on the lawn.<br /><br />And while it is true, as some have noted, that it does not have an obvious beginning, middle, and end, it does still tell a story.  And this book serves its purpose the same way many of the old rhymes do.  It teaches diction, vocabulary and memory skills:  all of which are early reading aids.<br /><br />This mom and dad give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Pam T~	2005-04-29

The story had a cute plot and it kept my children's interest.  \\"Missing Mittens\\"  (which was all about even and odd numbers) had a clumsy rhyme and it  wasn't nearly as good.  This book about comparing-and-contrasting sizes is different still.  It has too few words and virtually no plot.  Take a look at the sentences from the first *3 pages*:<br /><br />\\"I am big.\\"<br />\\"I am bigger than you are.\\"<br />\\"I am the biggest bug by far.\\"<br /><br />Not much plot development there, and while the pictures detail  more activity, it is insufficient for young readers/viewers.<br /><br />On the bright side the `summary' pages are good.  They show the 3 bugs currently under discussion (small, smaller, smallest, for example) in juxtaposition which makes it easy to talk about the concepts.<br /><br />So I would say that if you are willing to compose a story to go along with the pictures you can use this book to successfully teach your children about relative size.

My kids find the retellings of classic tales interesting, and the fact that they can 'read' the story themselves, works to build their confidence.<br /><br />This little book is written for beginning readers.  It is at the Kindergarten Reading Level:  AR 0.8.  The book contains 60 vocabulary words; 296 words total.<br /><br />The story follows Tom's adventures as various sorts of creatures mistake him for a meal.  Tom is rescued from each situation and ultimately ends up with a king that treats him kindly; offering Tom an ornate chair and a mouse complete with saddle to carry him.  Tom appreciates these things, but ultimately decides that he must return home where he is warmly welcomed by this parents.<br /><br />The sentences are better than those of Dick and Jane, but the story of Tom Thumb is definitely not completely explained by the text, so unless your child is familiar with the story you should read or tell them the full version beforehand.<br /><br />The artwork by Dennis Hockerman is nice and all-in-all this little book is not a bad purchase for a beginner reader if you can get it at a reasonable price.<br /><br />Recommend for practice. No down side except that children soon move on and are ready for more exciting reading material.	2005-04-19

It covers time by relating the hours of the day to a little boy's activities: waking up, meals, going to school, playing, going home, story time, nap time, bath time, going to bed, etc.  [If you are wondering about the early morning hours, they are spent frolicking with some friendly dream-monsters that dance and caper about.]<br /><br />The book focuses only on the `hour' but I think for a start that is perfect.  After a child can read the hours reliably they can move on to the half-hour, quarter hours, etc.<br /><br />Each hour in this book is given a page which demonstrates not only how that hour is spent but both a digital and conventional (analog) representations of the time. The artwork is colorful and sweet and my only real complaint is that I wish they had separated the pictures of the analog clock from that of the digital clock because it makes it hard to `test' whether a child can read the traditional clock.  (Digital seems so much easier for some reason.)<br /><br />As with all of Mr. Murphy's books there are suggestions for how to teach time at the end of the book as well as various practice/exercise ideas.  In addition, in this book, the author has a recommended reading list of three other books about time:  Clocks and More Clocks by Pat Hutchins; My First Book of Time by Claire Llewllyn; and Train Leaves the Station by Eve Merriam.<br /><br />You might also try a video called Rock N' Learn: Telling Time that has been useful in reinforcing the concept of reading clocks around our house.<br /><br />NOTE:  As for the age recommendation, I think this book would also be good for a younger child.  With my just turned 3 year old we discuss just how time passes and how we have certain activities that we do at the same time each day.	2005-04-14

One of the things that early childhood educators say is important for young children is to be exposed to poems and other rhythmic literature.  And it is, they tell us, helpful for kids to learn to recite.  It is for these and other reasons that I really, really like this book.  Not only is the artwork fun and `cleanly' charming, but the topic is interesting to children and the words are just repetitive enough to make it a great read... and a great recite!<br /><br />For example, we will be out fooling around in the yard and someone will simply yell, \\"Is the trash truck full yet?\\" and the rest of us (including hubby) will shout yes or no; and then we will be off reciting the whole piece.  What better evidence than that and the constant calls for `again, again' can you provide to prove that a book is good.<br /><br />Note:  The other commentator  was correct.  I think that the age ranges are incorrect.  I would think 6 and under would be more appropriate.	2005-04-14

If you do `Organic', then you probably already know Rodale Press and their penchant for searching out and finding the best possible authors.  With Sally Jean Cunningham they certainly have a hit the jackpot.  She writes so clearly and with such joy that you would think she was a Rodale herself.<br /><br />To give you an idea of what her style is like, in the introduction,  Sally Jean illuminates the three harvests that she personally derives from her garden.  The first is what you would expect, healthful vegetables and beautiful flowers; the second however is \\"satisfaction and peace of mind\\".  And the third, she says, is the experience of getting to teach to others the techniques and secrets  that she has learned over a lifetime of experimentation in the garden.<br /><br />It would be very difficult to outline all that she teaches.  Giving the chapter headings would only be misleading, but suffice it to say that she covers companion planting, french intensive/raised gardening, organic soil building and pest control (which happily includes how to train dogs and children to stay out of the raised beds-LOL)  And this in the first few chapters.<br /><br />From there she covers `\\"good guys\\" or those beneficials we'd all like to see dancing about our blooms, the inclusion of perennials amongst the seasonal throng; and design elements, such as arbors, creative mulch, creative garden design, etc.<br /><br />Of continual use to me over the years are the sections at the end of the book where she goes veggie by veggie describing friends, foes, growing essentials, spacing, feeding, harvesting tips and problems one is likely to encounter.<br /><br />She also has some summary charts for Beneficials (insects) and plants they like; plants and the pests they may repel; as well as several pages on \\"Preventing Pest\\" problems in the first place.<br /><br />Personally, I have only 3 gardening books at home and this is one.

(I don't assume that they will take to a book the first time.)  Further, my daughter, who is the sensitive sort, was bothered by the fact that the coyote wanted to eat poor little borreguita.<br /><br />We love \\"Bringing the Rain to Kapiti Plain\\" by Verna Aardema but that book has more of a rhythmic cadence that this book lacks and perhaps that is why it was not a hit in my house.<br /><br />That said, you can see from the other reviews that other children loved it.

It is just wonderful and my kids (boy and girl; now 3 and 5) ask for it at least 3 times a year (and I know we would read it even more often if we owned a copy).<br /><br />Principally, this is a story all about waiting for dinner to arrive.  Little Vivian has been patient but now toys can no longer distract her, which is when Mom steps in to exercise a little imagination.  She asks Vivian what she will say when the door bell rings and they open the door.  Vivian answers, \\"Hi Pizza man\\".  Mom then asks what she will do if it's not pizza man, but instead pizza woman.  Real silliness ensues when the question becomes what will she say to pizza cat/dog/duck/cow/snake/dinosaur.<br /><br />The pictures are rich, fun and exotic (by Ponder Goembel).  Pizza Duck has jewelry, ear rings and a turban: very grand.  Pizza Snake wears 3 bow ties and a bowler hat.

This book however has never been a favorite and I am not exactly sure why.  Perhaps it has something to do with the pictures.  As someone noted previously some of them are darkish.  In addition, I would also say that some have parts that are out of focus, while others just have a strange color contrast to them.<br /><br />That said, this Barney book covers a *typical* farm day with activities such as milking, feeding the animals, and picking vegetables.  It covers familiar farm places and animals:  home, barn, rooster, horse, hay, cows, hens and eggs, tractor, corn, scarecrow, and vegetables.  It just doesn't do it in Barney style and I would suggest that you just give this one a pass.	2005-03-01

Except for one brief description, which is probably for parents, it has one simple sentence per page, such as \\"In the early spring, a ladybug lays her eggs on a leaf.\\"<br /><br />I can not speak to the difficulty these sentences might present to newer readers as my children are not reading yet, but the book does contain the following words:  aphid, cranefly, larva, mealybug, pupa, robberfly and beetle.<br /><br />The story takes us through the seasons:  from early spring where a ladybug is flying away from a leaf where she has laid eggs; to late spring where an emerging larva soon begins devouring aphids.  This larva soon changes into a pupa from which a new ladybug emerges.  This summer beetle then goes in search of food and has some adventures in which she barely escapes being lunch to a warbler and a praying mantis.  Other bugs are eaten by the way.  I mention this because some children might find this distressing.<br /><br />Finally, the ladybug looks for a mate.  Nothing objectionable for children here, in my opinion, and the next page shows our beetle laying her own eggs.  Then everyone hibernates over the winter.<br /><br />Overall a nice story about the life of a ladybug.	2005-02-28

This dictionary by Dorling Kindersley is just what a childs reference book should be.  It is sturdy and brightly attractive and my 4 year old daughter often asks me to sit down with her and just look at the various pictures and tell her what word goes with them.<br /><br />Beyond that I have found it to be a mommy life-saver because this same child --and now my son-- will ask me what something means and I find myself at a loss as to how to explain the word in simple enough terms.  Wa-La, the DK Illustrated dictionary.  Their explanations are short and perfect; and although it is not a comprehensive dictionary (you will not find words like impugn and insolent) it is certainly the best one that my hubby and I have found on the market.	2005-02-27

This book is so well suited for bedtime  that all I can add to the other 79 persons who praised it  (4 or more stars) is that Fox and Dyer are geniuses.<br /><br />\\"The stars on high are shining bright--<br /><br />Sweet dreams, my darling, sleep well...<br /><br />Good night.\\"	2005-02-25

And what makes it even more fun is that below the poem there are 4 to 5 objects that your child can search for.  My children loved this when they were younger and now that they are older we search for other objects that are less visible.<br /><br />A great introduction to poetry and with Barney, Mother Goose and I Spy--what more can a parent want.	2005-02-25

This is an attractive book that combines lift-the-flaps with textures.  The combination is appealing to my young toddlers, but I have to say that it is not the sort of book I leave out for them to play with unsupervised.  I've had others constructed like it and the flaps just don't stay attached (if you know what I mean).<br /><br />The story begins when an adorable baby mouse in diapers starts to seek his friends:  a pink salamander behind a bowl of smooth cherries; a brown mole behind a pot filled with scratchy sand; a butterfly behind silky flowers; and a black skunk behind a watering can of shiny water.  The story ends when his friends seek him and find him behind a rough basket.<br /><br />These are all elements that small people can relate to and I would say that if you are looking for a sweet non-Barney, non-commercial kind of gift that it would be a good choice.	2005-02-25

The poetry may not be Shakespeare or even Jack and Jill, but it hardly matters.  There is something about the colors, shapes and animals that youngsters cannot get enough of.  My almost 3 year old son, for example, loves this book. He asks for it every night, and we have owned this book for over a year now.<br /><br />For myself, I particularly like that there are other things in the drawings to talk about.  For example when ovals are discussed, there is a a red bird (Cardinal) and storm clouds.  In the circle pages (there are 2 pages per topic) there are many kinds of vegetables to point out.<br /><br />Overall a good beginners book for shapes, and though we have now moved on to hexagons, my son and daughter still enjoy this book.	2005-02-25

For example, Barney's *shiney* vest, what was actually in Barney's lunchbox (yummy grapes, apple, sandwich, etc.) and the fact that there were 3 scoops of ice cream on the cone (1,2,3).<br /><br />Simply a nice little educational book.	2005-02-24

I have used this book as a reference for over 20 years, and have used Mel's methods in the sands of Florida, the gumbo of Texas, and now the 'barely there' soil of Northern Virginia.  And what have I gotten... production and ease!<br /><br />Based in part on the French Intensive method of gardening, you pretty much can avoid the inherent soil problems of where you live and grow veggies and flowers with little weeding and grunting.<br /><br />Ideas in this book include:<br /><br />How to prepare the soil (fertilizers, conditioners)<br /><br />How to put together raised beds and other support structures if you want them<br /><br />A guide for popular vegetables<br /><br />-- how and when to plant them, including how to start seeds<br /><br />-- the what-fors of watering<br /><br />-- common pest and disease problems<br /><br />In my opinion this easy to read book is a gardening staple good for all levels of experience.	2005-02-24

Unlike the show, however, I found that these stories are not very nice.  For example, in \\"Charles Stands Tall\\", Charles is humiliated for being small and shy.  My kids (3 and 5)  were distressed by the story line particularly about the part where Charles is bullied and may fun of.  Page 29 sums it up well.  \\"Charles did not cry until he got off the school bus.\\"<br /><br />Likewise in another chapter, a beaver named Doris is called `fat' and `too big'.  When she is nicknamed \\"Tubette,\\" the teacher does nothing about the bullying but instead allows the children to carry on and giggle at Doris' expense.  Perhaps others will think this is alright because her family steps in and offers her support in the way of diet and exercise, but to me this is just too mean spirited.  Plus, I don't like the message at the end where the main bully compliments Doris on her efforts and says,  \\"(s)oon you will be nice and thin like me.\\"<br /><br />This might be great for some kids, but I can't recommend it.	2005-02-01

Not only is some of the artwork gruesome, but the story fails to deliver anything close to the original message of how gold (or make-substitution-here) is not the end-all of life.<br /><br />In Well's version, Ruby tells her little brother about an 'ancient' Max (Midas), who instead of turning everything into gold with a touch, turns everyone into dessert with his laser eyes.  Mom is zapped.  Dad is zapped, and there is no sign of regret until sister is changed into a slice of cake.  Then, without explanation, there is a sudden change of heart.  (I guess one can only conclude that it was okay to zap mom and dad but not sis.)<br /><br />The text is not the only problem though.  The pictures of Max and his blood-red eyes are strange.  Supposedly laser light, the emanations stream down in arches, not in straight lines.  It looks more like Max is leaking blood from his eyes.  Yeech.<br /><br />Can't recommend it.	2005-02-01

A carpenter, a juggler, a football player, a dog-walker, an artist, a barber, a conductor, and gardener are the people your child will meet when reading this book.  The scenario is as follows:<br /><br />Who uses this? the author asks.  The print is in large letters.  On the following page is an item such as a hammer.  On the following set of pages there is a picture of a carpenter building a home, followed by a picture of a little girl building something with wood, nails and a hammer.<br /><br />I said in my title that this was a good book but maybe not an excellent purchase.  The reason I think this is because after a few reads I think it might become obsolete.  My 4 yo knew all of the items and people except for the baton the conductor uses and soon lost interest.  My almost 3 y.o. still likes it however after many reads because of the pictures and because he is still learning about jugglers and such.  So I guess, it depends on your child and what they like and whether they have any siblings or friends who could use the book later.  Hope this helps.	2005-01-04

While the artwork is delightful, the rhymes are clumsy, and worse, the premise just is not very interesting.  At least, finding out what happened to the cow's utter-mittens did not engage my kids (almost 3 and 5).<br /><br />On the plus side, the book did give my almost 5 y.o. and myself a place to start talking about even and odd.  And the way that the artist showed the pairs of mittens and the missing mitten in outline made it easy to point out what the story was taking about.<br /><br />But I'd give this book a pass unless you are desparate to find an edutainment introduction to even/odd numbers.	2005-01-04

The `reading-literacy' project was given solid funding by the government and Ms. Adams has done a superlative job of surveying the literature and coming up with reasonable conclusions.<br /><br />That said, there is a problem.  And the problem is that \\"Beginning to Read\\" was written for bureaucrats.  The straightforward language we might expect from an educator and researcher is therefore made obscure, obtuse, and overly `officious'.  [No doubt pleasing to the edu-crats.]<br /><br />For example, (from page 413; the summary):  \\"It is because of the process of comprehension consists of actively searching the overlap among words for syntactic and semantic coherence that reading depends so critically on the speed and automaticity of word recognition.\\"<br /><br />[Or, in other words, reading comprehension depends on speed and automatic word recognition so that the nascent reader can make use of syntax and semantics. ]<br /><br />Not incomprehensible in it's original form, Adam's verbiage is awkward and somehow embarrassing for a book that is supposed to be about `reading' and `comprehension'.<br /><br />Three Stars.  A comprehensive survey of current and past literature, this book  attempts--and in my opinion succeeds-- in reconciling the phonics versus whole language camps.  However, expect a slog of it.  [Unless of course you are an edu-crat in which case the officiousness will sound very convincing indeed-lol]<br /><br />Anyone else interested in this topic but with less time might find the same information in a `tastier' format in the following books:  Mem Fox's \\"Reading Magic\\"; and the slightly less digestible \\"Raising Lifelong Learners\\" by Lucy McCormick Calkins.<br /><br />Pam T.	2004-07-31

First of all, instead of the girl on the cover, we have a skeleton; and second, we have half the number of pages as listed above.<br /><br />That said, my girlie-girl has come to really like this book.  I find her sitting alone, gazing through it with an inquisitive look on her face.  [How cool is that!]<br /><br />The book labels lots of body parts --internal and external-- and discusses how we're different on the outside.  It has given us a means of discussing bones and what lungs and hearts and such do.  Sort of an invisible man for preschoolers.<br /><br />We've found nothing 'gross' in the texts and it is the only book I've found thus far that is on a simple enough level. (Of course, I skim over some details to keep it easy.  We'll add those in later as she becomes more sophisticated.)<br /><br />Four stars because there could be even more.  Touch and feel taste-buds, for example.	2004-07-27

(DORA THE EXPLORER)	Books	2	14	17	N	N	Book is colorful, but lacks read-aloud-ability	We love Dora, but these Simon Spotlight\Nick Jr. books lack read-aloud-ability.<br /><br />Since my daughter and son are 4 and 2-years respectively, they love Dora and Boots, and I have bought several of these little books but always with pretty much the same experience:  I have to invent parts of the storyline and/or ignore some of it.  For example, in this book the crew comes upon a ladder with no rungs.  Like in the television version the rungs are hidden in the forest and need to be found and counted.  No problem.  However rather than showing Diego, Dora and Boots climbing the ladder after their successfully reconstructing it, we are shown two pages of them sliding down a zip cord.  For young kids this is a discontinuity.  They need to see them climb the completed ladder.  It is a stupid bit of editing in my humble opinion.<br /><br />There are other examples of similar unreadability and my advice is to get these at the library, or if you must own, we really like Little Star.	2004-07-15

We LOVE Bear, but we don't love this book.  The story line is very specific but not anywhere as good as the plot in the TV episode &#34;Potty Time&#34;.<br /><br />First, the flaps are uninteresting.  In one Ojo merely moves her hands to her crotch (one supposes to indicate that she has to 'go'.  And in another, Ojo holds Snowbear up higher.  Boring for me and my 2 year old daughter.  [There is also a pull tab which in one case lowers a stool to the ground, and in another lengthens TP hanging off a roll.  Wow!]<br /><br />Second, where there is innovation, it is difficult to use.  There is a wheel which makes it look as if water is running in a toilet & in a sink where Ojo is washing her hands- the mechanism is difficult to use, even for me.<br /><br />Perhaps this is book is just age inappropriate for us....	2002-02-15
