It has no redeeming qualities of any kind, and has no real reason for being. I have no idea why a book such as this is needed to introduce the minor Episode II character Luminara Unduli. Even if such a novel is needed, this is definitely not a good entrance for any character. <br />  To begin with, the book has no plot whatsoever. An attempt at plot was made, which revolves around a planet of apparently minor significance that, through an obscure and utterly nonsensical series of alliances, will destroy half the Republic if it decides to secede from the galactic government. A group of corrupt business people decide that destroying the galaxy's government would be good for business, and so they set out an a laughably unsophisticated plot to get Ansion to withdraw its membership. Two Jedi Knights and their Padawans (Obi-Wan, Anakin, Luminara and her apprentice Bariss) are sent to stop the plot before it can unfold. If it sounds like you have heard this before, it's because you have. The plot is totally unoriginal, and actually manages to be worse than the cut-and-paste plots of some other novels based around the same idea.  <br />  Anyway, the Jedi wander around the planet in their efforts to stop the secession. As time goes on, they become more and more irritating. They have completely interchangeable personalities, and are totally inconsistent in how they are portrayed. Despite little sentences here and there that remind us that Bariss is to be considered \\"by the book\\" at all times, and Anakin is supposed to be reckless, they never assert these aspects of themselves at all. <br />  Also, I never cared at all about the characters. None of them was the least bit engrossing. It takes some BAD writing to butcher Obi-Wan to the point where I wouldn't blink if he were to catch a blaster bolt, but after reading Approaching Storm I really would not mind at all if he were to die tomorrow. <br />  All of the characters behave eratically at best, changing their standards of right and wrong on a regular basis. The Jedi get angry whenever someone tries to provoke them, obsequious and unremarkeable cripples that they cure go around and tell them everything you never wanted to know about an unimportant planet. In one absolutely atrocious scene a diplomat tells them he does not believe in the Force, so the calm and collected Luminara basically says \\"I find your lack of faith disturbing,\\" while dumping glasses of water on his face. While this is going on, the same Obi-Wan Kenobi that found Han's rejection of the Force so funny in A New Hope is featured in this book silently cheering Luminara on... <br />  The cultures they visit are completely ... and unbelievably stereotypical for any planet in a sci-fi novel. You have your primitive race, your tech race, your nomads, and your usual assortmant of miscellaneous creatures. None of the cultures have any memorable qualities, and many [read: all] of them seem to be in the book just to take up pages.<br />  The writing itself is also unbelievably bland and unimaginative. Not only does it manage to be completely unengrossing, but at times during the book I could not shake the feeling that I was reading a travel brochure. I guess that this book would have to be classified as character-driven because so much of it focuses on the characters involved without driving the plot at all, but for a character driven book to have nothing but uninvolving, interchangeable, and totally forgettable characters is ludicrous and shows a total lack of focus for a book.<br />  Do not buy this book for any reason. I cannot stress that enough. If you want a Star Wars book, get Star by Star. In spite of its dark atmosphere (or perhaps because of it) it really is a good book that is worth every penny of the price. As for The Approaching Storm, it always gives you the feeling that SOMETHING is approaching, but never threatening. The Storm never actually arrives, and the book never actually delivers. Save your money or buy Star by Star. Believe me, Approaching Storm is not worth buying.	2002-02-20
US	49862818	R3AFFIUDBX7UBR	0345446100	108368651	2: Edge of Victory II: Rebirth (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, No. 8)	Books	3	10	12	N	N	Nothing special in a galaxy far, far away.	Edge of Victory is a descent adventure book, but will not live up to its predecessor in the two book series. The plot centers on Anakin, again, but it also includes Kyp Durron, and the New Republic's lack of trust for the jedi. The story begins as Borsk Fey'lya orders the arrest of Luke Skywalker. Luke and his wife Mara go into hiding, with Mara's illness coming back again, harder this time. This is not really a part of the book, but it's pretty clear it will be important for the story line of the New Jedi Order. <br />  Jaina Solo and Kyp Durron's plot is actually quite interesting, probably the best big part of the book. It centers around a new Yuuzhan Vong shipyard that is far larger than even the Death Stars of old. They enlist the help of a few others in the Republic military in an effort to knock out the weapon before it becomes operational. While the &quot;surprise&quot; ending to that plot is a little bit incredible and not particulary interesting, the parts leading up to it are very well written and the book becomes quite difficult to put down during those sequences. <br />  Anakin, meanwhile, has gone off with his old friend Tahiri in search of supplies (Corran Horn follows them the whole time, but his part in the book has been reduced to rattling off little lessons that Anakin needs to learn).This part of the book was moderately interesting, but the ending was extremely disappointing and a bit inconsistent. The buildup to it was just not worth the trouble. When you consider that their little side trek could just as easily have been removed from the entire book without damaging the plot much it becomes apparent that Keyes wrote it either to take up space or because he was forced to.     <br />  Han's morality lessons with Jacen were remarkeable only for their incredible lack of impact on anything. Joined by Leia, those two characters did almost nothing for the entire book, and their arguments rapidly became trite. I found their whole subplot boring and unimaginative. Their dialogue (especially noticeable with Han) was off, never really capturing their characters, and they had little impact on much of anything. <br />  Even with its flaws, Rebirth still does deliver things that make it worth buying for dedicated fans of the series. For one thing, its plot does seem to be very important. Many of the characters change during the course of the book, and for that it is worth reading. Nen Yim's (the shaper adept from the first one) plot was actually very interesting, and occasionally humorous. The character interactions (with the exception of Han/Leia/Jacen) were very good, and despite the disappointing ending on Givin that part of the book is worth sitting through. <br />  It is clear that Rebirth is intended to be a Rubicon for many of the characters in the Universe. Luke's &quot;great river&quot; may be seen as a metaphor for irrevocable decisions that several of the characters are forced to make. Their actions during such sequences are quite interesting. In spite of this, only people following the NJO should pick up the book. It fails to deliver the plot and generate interesting enough characters to justify picking up for someone who is only mildly interested in the series. <br />  If you have not yet started reading the NJO, pick up Balance Point or Vector Prime. Maybe even read Conquest just to see if you like it. If you don't, save some money on this one. If you do, great. Pick up Rebirth, too. You won't get a great read out of it, but you will advance the plot for the next series of books to follow.	2001-08-01

This is kind of an interesting book for anyone who is really, REALLY interested in all that is mysterious in North America. Unfortunately, I found the book to be too centered on the United States and Canada, with little mention of anything in Mexico. This was quite disappointing, as I had picked up the book in large part to try and find out about some of the Mayan and Aztec sites in the region. Also, many of the entries were far too brief. Sometimes the lack of information was almost criminal, with little explanation for why the site was included in such a survey. If you are looking for a book that covers all of the US and Canada, this would be a good book. If you require a more in-depth analysis of a SPECIFIC area or type of site, then there are better books out there. I would recommend A Natural History of the Unnatural World for a humorous title (it never takes itself too seriously). This one is one to be left on the shelf for most people.	2001-05-15

Edge of Victory, like its name sake, managed to be on the very edge of victory. I was VERY tempted to give this one a five star rating. It had a remarkably  engrossing style that felt both fluent and fluid. At times it was VERY hard to put down. The two or three different plots kept me wanting to find out what had happened to another character. <br />Nonetheless, Edge of Victory had a few flaws that prevented it from being a triumph. Despite a TINY character development section in the early going, the first few chapters were painfully slow. This is kind of a shame since the later chapters managed to be so exciting. The lack of development actually did not cripple the book, as you actually manage to care about most of the characters. I was genuinely affected by Master Ikrit and his small bit of the plot, even though the reasons behind his actions were sometimes a bit muddy.<br />Edge of Victory is an EXCELLENT book that belongs on the shelf of every Star Wars fan. Keyes created what is probably the best of the NJO series with a flamboyance that is difficult to match, and a style that managed to be fast paced and engrossing in the later chapters. A book that is well worth reading, I have no hesitation in recommending this book to everyone with even a passing interest in the NJO.	2001-05-13
US	49862818	R2VVGOA9X4ZSO2	0812550706	401439625	Ender's Game (The Ender Quintet)	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Not bad. Not great, but not bad.	Ender's game is a VERY well written book about a six-year old prodigy who is selected by the government to become a soldier. Though he is an outcast at school, he excels in his new home where a series of games are designed to teach the children how to fight a war against the mysterious &quot;Buggers&quot;. As Ender and his friends begin the fight, they face trials beyond anything they could have imagined in their old, mundane homes on earth.<br />  Attacks on the plot are very much unfounded. There ARE six-year old geniuses. Many of them grow up playing chess and become grandmasters. Some work on mathematics, though these people typically lose much of their talent as they grow older. Many focus on music. It is not outlandish to think that child prodigies could be turned into soldiers, if they were made to focus on that subject.<br />  As the book goes on the differences between civilian and military life are made clear to the reader. The tactics and strategies that Ender uses are all believable and powerful. The characters, for the most part, are very good. Yet a serious knock on the book remains that removes the book from a fifth star-Ender's intelligence is often variable. Some problems exist on the school (which is deep in outer space) that make it obvious that the school is not what it appears. Though these problems are later explained away, it appears that Ender did not catch them immediately. If Ender was so intelligent (he took physics and trig. when he was six) why did he not realize that something was amiss? For someone who took physics (or, indeed, had basic logic at his command) why would he not have noticed these obvious problems with the station? Ender also does not realize that the &quot;game&quot; he plays is actually real, and not a simple simulation.<br />  This flaw prevents Ender's Game from becoming the classic that it really should be. Nonetheless, it is an excellent book that definitely deserves serious attention, and should be read by anyone even remotely interested in Science Fiction or Military Tactics.	2001-05-02
US	49862818	R1DC0GMCC6HU71	0553578731	253987847	Star Wars: I, Jedi	Books	1	8	18	N	N	Sorry, Mr. Stackpole, but you are not a Jedi, yet.	Every now and then I have the displeasure of reading a book that could have been so much more than it was. I, Jedi is one such book. Although I agree with some other reviewers who say that the character development (and they mean character development singular, as there is only one real character) was good, I must disagree with them on how good it was. Yes, Corran is a well developed character, but I never cared at ALL about his wife, Mirax (who forms the basis of the entire plot). I found Elegos (Corran's servant) highly annoying and inconsistent.<br />  Corran's enemies are TRULY moronic. Especially the Dark Jedi that have teamed up with Admiral Tavira (no explanation is given for this). Think about it. If you were a part of an immensely powerful group of Dark Jedi who were in many ways better at fighting than Luke's band, why would you ally yourself with a rogue imperial with exactly ONE Star Destroyer and a tiny armada of smaller ships? Why would you not merely take the galaxy for yourself?<br />  Corran also does some REALLY stupid things. For one thing, he places a &quot;Cubit Zarchonia&quot; in his lightsaber as a focusing crystal, settling for second best. Seeing as how the crystals must be perfectly aligned in order to keep the weapon from exploding upon activation, you would think that he would be smart enough to find a real diamond (he also says that they're pretty easy to find, in the Star Wars Universe).<br />  I found the plot to be very weak at times. Mr. Stackpole had to bend over backwards to put Corran into the Jedi Academy Trilogy (which, incidentally, I liked MUCH more). Unfortunately, in doing so, Stackpole changes the meaning of some well written scenes from the classic. He also changes the personalities of many of the Jedi from self-sufficient, strong-willed characters into mere observers who had little to do with the plot (Luke, in particular, is victimized).<br />  Corran is also unbelievably good at doing certain things. He is able to outgun Rogue Squadron in an inferior fighter craft, and is able to do incredible things that make little sense. He can waltz through hordes of enemies without moral compunctions of ANY kind, but he cannot fall in love with a woman other than his wife (that scene also made little sense)?<br />  I found Corran's moral code to be inconsistent at best, and found it to be a boring side-track from the rest of the book. I cannot believe how polarized the views on this book are. Many people really liked it, so you might also. If you DO decide to get the book, don't say that I didn't warn you. For the thinking part of the population, this is a horrible book. Buy almost anything else, instead. I would particularly recommend the very trilogy that was so badly butchered by this monstrosity (Jedi Academy, by Kevin Anderson), The Courtship of Princess Leia, or the Heir to the Empire Trilogy. If you have an IQ higher than that of Dilbert's Pointy Haired Boss, you'll thank me later. By the way, look at the front cover and see the X-Wing that is missing a laser cannon, it reminds me a lot of the book, except that the book was missing a plot, instead.	2001-05-01
US	49862818	R312IVKRPR10C	0345435397	595671727	Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter (Star Wars)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Well written but ill concieved.	First of all, Shadow Hunter is a very well written book. The characters were all well thought out, and they each had unique personalities. They all made decisions that made sense, and they all managed to get the reader to care about, and understand, them. <br />Unfortunately, Shadow Hunter's premise detracts from its over effectiveness as a novel. First of all, the idea of having Obi-Wan enter in his own cameo was poor, because Obi-Wan could NOT kill-or even see-Darth Maul. I am left wondering why the author chose to enter him into the novel. In addition, the constraints of having to work so closely in line with the Phantom Menace and its plot force the author to make more concessions in Shadow Hunter's own plot. For instance, the ending managed to seem dissappointing in large part because I was expecting a surprise finish. Instead it appeared to be an almost completely generic bit that left me feeling cheated. Indeed, the four star rating I gave it might have been a bit high, but I will give the author the benefit of the doubt in this case due to the ambitious premise of the book. Otherwise, it may have fallen to a three.<br />Make no mistake, Shadow Hunter is a very good book. However, I would not recommend it for people who need good plots in order to understand a book. For those people, I would instead point out the Heir to the Empire series. For people who like strong characters, this might be the right book to choose. A must read for Darth Maul fans, it nonetheless falls short of the average fan's expectations.	2001-05-01
US	49862818	R2WLP9LRFH2V5	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	5	2	3	N	N	GREAT book	First of all, let's get some things clear. There IS a &quot;deeper&quot; meaning to The Lord of the Flies. In fact, there are dozens. Second of all, Golding was an English schoolmaster who understood how children behaved. The idea that he was not qualified to write about children's behavior is ludicrous. One reviewer is partially correct when he states that children rarely attack each other. They rarely attack each other IN THE PRESENCE OF AUTHORITY. Finally, society could have developed with human nature the way that Golding presents it because human brains were developed to allow us to interact socially with other humans. Society would have then been made up of fifty to a hundred people, and authority would have been present, too.<br />Having said all that, the only reason why you could not like this book is if you absolutely did not understand it. The Lord of the Flies might not have changed my life, but it really was a GREAT book. Its symbolism is poignant, clear, and powerful. The message the book gets across is wonderful.<br />This dark, somewhat disturbing book is absolutely worth reading, and a copy belongs on the shelf of every serious reader. Each time I have read it I have come up with new meanings that I missed the previous time and it never gets old.<br />If you know how to read it, it is definitely NOT boring. Be prepared for a wonderfully written, powerful book about the darker side of human nature.	2001-04-25

The Naked and the Dead is far and away the best book that I have ever read. It makes me question why back in High School they made us read All Quiet on the Western Front. The Naked and the Dead blends the voice of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest with the message of All Quietand the symbolism of the Lord of the Flies. It then adds a reasonable plot and understandable (if bizarre) characters.<br />The book places a platoon of soldiers on the fictitios, Japanese-held island of Anopopei during the Second World War. As they move about the island on a perilous scouting mission, the reader is made to understand, symbolically, the evils of war. In a reasonably engrossing writing style.<br />Make no mistake, this is not the best book for everyone. It deals with VERY mature themes like sex, war, prejudice, and violence. People who's reading comprehensions are not &quot;up to snuff&quot; will find little here but an average plot and an incomprehensible tangle of words. Basically, if you can't BREEZE through The Lord of the Flies, you'll waste your money with this one.<br />In answer to other criticisms, Mailer is NOT anti-semitic. Many of his characters are, but they are clearly not protagonists. It is clear that Mailer is writing about anti-semitism, but that he does not believe in it. Goldstein (a Jew)is by far the most engrossing, understandable character. He is the only one in the platoon blessed (or perhaps cursed) with feelings of empathy towards others, with a decent personality. He is the only character who is not a womanizer, a murderer, or an evil person.<br />Goldstein is made a Jew for a reason: Mailer needs to show his readers the evils of prejudice, rascism, and ethnocentrism.<br />Mailer's symbolism is matched only by his voice, which comes through easily and demonstrates Mailer's incredible talent.<br />Yet Mailer's words force the reader to come to grips with his own nature. They advance powerful views on war, futility, good and evil. An absolute JEWEL of a book, the Naked and the Dead belongs on every serious reader's shelf. It is difficult for a book like this to be thought of as being UNDER rated given its rave-reviews. Having read it, I think that it may be the most under-rated book of all time.	2001-04-25

It moved at a glacial pace,  particularly during the opening parts of the book. Also it forgot about  incredibly important parts of the book. It never adequately explained what  happened to Vergere, a Jedi Knight who caused a panic when she disappeared,  and while the book made a huge deal about how these fast starships are  organic, it is later shown that this has very little to do with their  performance; even going so far as to explain that the ship has a modified  hyperdrive. The enemies were unconvincing, the plot pretty weak, and the  character interaction poor. I do enjoy foreshadowing, but not when it takes  hundreds of pages to develop. I also found out why his Hugo and Nebula  winning book was entitled &quot;EON&quot;. . . because it must have taken  an eon to develop. Another thing that bothered me was that the galaxy was  never really in any danger. And while the characters (who included Obi-Wan  and Anakin Skywalker) are often faced with life or death decisions, you  never really care if they live or die. A sub par book, read the Jedi  Academy Trilogy, or Heir to the Empire instead.	2000-07-07

Dark Tide 1 (Onslaught) was hands down Michael Stackpole's best work yet. Dark Tide II (Ruin) was only a so-so follow up to it. The writing style seemed to lose some of its fluidity since the earlier book in the series,  and character introductions seemed a tad sloppy. Also, characters like  Jaina Solo bothered me because the idea that a veteran pilot like her would  have to go through the debate about the merits of using proton torpedoes  against fighters was ludicrous. Despite the fact that the book is dedicated  to Star Wars fans, I found that it also seemed written down to us in a  manner that was condescending and borderline insulting. Simple devices and  debates had to be gone over again in detail. Since this is a sequel, it  would have been better if he had merely assumed that the people reading it  had also read some of his earlier work (which at times he appeared to do,  hence the lack of descriptions of ANY characters). I had almost grown to  respect Stackpole for the changes he made in his writing since the X-Wing  books, but now I see that too many of them from Onslaught were merely  mistakes.	2000-06-19

Brian Jacque writes about Fantasy in which animals are personified to the extreme. The writing is quite good, but extremely taxing  to read. Indeed, only readers who are returning to the series will be at  all able to follow mole speech without going over it a few times, and the  intricate language of hares seems little better. The story itself is quite  good, and the only thing separating this novel from a fifth star is the  surprising, and uncharacteristically sloppy introductions for so many of  the characters. If you like the other novels of Redwall buy this book. If  you have not read any of the others, perhaps Redwall, or Mossflower would  be a better place to begin.	2000-06-19

I don't carewhat your target audience is, but you should always show SOME respect for the reader. The plot wasn't too bad, actually, and the characters were depicted reasonably well. The book falls upon its face when you start to look at it more closely. Characters do things for little or no reason on every other page, ALL of the characters showed an incredible amount of indecisiveness that damages their credibility. I am tired of hearing what Obi Wan and Qui Gon are thinking, and why. A good writer wouldn't have to tell me, I would just understand them from the way they were talking and the way they did things.  The ending was just a travesty! A [cough] cliffhanger ending like that was OBVIOUSLY designed to make you buy the next book in the series. If you are under ten, buy the Junior Jedi Knight series.

Sienar was a very good character, but his &quot;friend&quot; Tarkin was missed by the dialogue and the goals. Anakin  Skywalker seemed a tad off, as did Obi Wan. I liked the Blood Cutter, and  the idea of the planet, but the book really should have talked more about  what happened to Vergere and the far outsiders. The mystery of Vergere was  one of the more engrossing parts of the story, but you never find out what  happened to her and what she learned. The entire idea of the Jedi Temple  was badly bungled as well. Also, the idea of super fast, organic ships  wasn't terribly original, and the ending was extremely dissapointing. A few  original characters and ideas save this from dropping lower on my scale,  but you should wait for the paper back, or read Dark Tide: Onslaught  instead.	2000-05-19

The writing tended to have a good,  text bookish feel, and the entire thing felt very well researched and well  designed. The pictures were nothing special, but they did show me what a  K-wing looked like for the first time, and they matched the text reasonably  well. The authors were even willing to sit through the Koornacht Cluster  Trilogy to write this book, which can either be taken as dedication above  and beyond, or sheer stupidity. If you aren't the greatest Star Wars fan in  the world than you might want to try another book, but for the person who  wants to know everything this is great.	2000-04-08

It eliminates the porblem that previous books had with having too many characters. It also develops all the characters reasonably well, particularly Wedge and Janson. Janson's sense of humor was equalled only by his single mindedness. Wedge  feels like a person in this one, with a distinctive character and a sense  of humanity. People who do not know the original trilogy should be warned  that the descriptions of the characters is rather sparse, particularly when  describing Hobbie. I liked how Iella was introduced partway through the  book, which kept her from becoming a clone of another woman, Cheriss.  Though the tactics were still rather flawed and overly simplistic, the  overall plot wasn't too bad. This is a good book for just about anyone who  likes Star Wars books, and a must have for any fan's shelf.	2000-04-02

The stories are pretty hit or miss, with many  dull, slow, boring ones thrown together with a couple of diamonds in the  ruff. Some of the stories also might be hard to understand for the casual  fan. I would recommend Tales from Mos Eisley Cantina, or Tales from Jabba's  Palace instead.	2000-04-01

It started off boring and ended with a dissappointing conclusion. Even though I love Jacen and Jaina, this book really never made me care for either one  of them. They seemed stuck up, snooty, and were constantly whining. A  friend that they meet, Lusa, is essentially a glorified centaur. This  really bothered me, because in Star Wars you would think that an author  could manage to think of some half way original creature. Everyone acter  uncharacteristically, particularly Luke, who seemed depressed and self  centered. Han and Luke's purpose in the story was pretty forgetable, and  the bits with Chewie in them were truly abysmal. If I didn't reserve the  one star rating for books like the Black Fleet Crisis, or I, Jedi, then I  would have rated this book that way. Buy The Courtship of Princess Leia, or  Tales from Mos Eisley Cantina instead. You will thank me later.	2000-04-01

This is the first book in the X-Wing trilogy that had a somewhat feasable plot. I was a little uncertain as to where Isard got all of her TIE Defenders, and the pilots to fly them. There are still too many characters  to keep track of well. Also, characters who return from the dead seriously  bothered me, particularly in the end sequence.

Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of the best in Fantasy. True,  there are a few problems with the plot, and a few indiscrepencies along the  way, but it is only with repeated readings that we spot those.

The action sequences (when there were any) were terrible. The plot was pretty improbable, but occasionally I found the plot to be half way decent, kind  of like those old B movies. The problem was that some of the characters  acted inconsistently, or they failed to act in character. Leia in  particular bothered me, she was incredibly indecisive.

This is a book that is well worth reading as long as you aren't expecting a book that is good as the previous ones. Most of the stories aren't half bad, though they don't interweave the way the ones in the Cantina, or  Jabba's Palace did. Bossk's tale was one of the more interesting ones, but  a dissappointing ending prevents it from being something better. The other  stories usually have somthing that keeps them from being great, and take a  much longer time to read than the ones in the previous books.

I disliked Vuffi Raa because the thought of the all powerful alien droid decided to team up with a smuggler (or allow himself to be won in a sabbac game like property) is  ridiculous.

It had the plot, the characters (Luke, Leia, and a woman named Halla) but something about this book didn't add up. First, there was the print. It felt like I was reading The Cat in the Hat! Second, once they  got on the planet, they meet a cast of cartoonish, happy-go-lucky  characters including the Yuzzem, an extraordinarily strong species that  Luke can somehow understand. It's a book that is truly based on  coincidence, so far as the plot goes, and does a poor job of detailing Luke  and Leia. They seem off as characters. It also bothered me at how easily  Luke is able to battle Vader, and the plot inconsistensy that allows  Vader's arm to bleed. I am aware of the fact that the book was written  before Empire, and long before RotJ, but it still bothered me. Also, Leia  is able to battle Vader, for a time. The book does do a reasonable job of  showing Luke's budding force talents, but this is not enough to justify the  atmosphere that the book is written in. Also, the book starts by having  Leia desperate to get to a conference on a world interested in joining the  Alliance, but that mission is totally forgotten by the end of the book! The  author doesn't even bother to bring us back to the planet they were flying  to in the first place. If this book had been a little more spit and  polished, it could have been great. But it isn't, so it ain't.	2000-03-31

What can I say in this book's defense? Leia is well done, and becomes more human when she begins to question the politics in Coruscant. She manages to be a reasonably well developed character. Even though her plot was descent,  the ending was terrible, nullifying all the development in the world. I was  also annoyed at how the talks between her and Nil Spaar dragged on in the  first book of the series.<br />Here's the fun part! Horrible characters were  created just for this book, like Plat Malar and General A'baht. What in the  world is a K-Wing? TRULY uninspired combat sequences (when there were any).  Incompetent people on both sides who act illogically and for no apparent  reason. Luke does virtually nothing for the entire book, and even though  his plotline EVENTUALLY ties in to Leia's it is still not worth reading  about. Han is taken out of the trilogy early on and fails to make a  reappearance. Lando and the droids' plot was quite possibly the STUPIDEST  Star Wars plot EVER (he finds an alien spacecraft and floats around while  Lobot cusses out the obnoxious, snooty Artoo and Threepio). ALL of the main  characters were SOOOOO badly out of character it's not even funny, and none  of the plots tied together. This was especially infuriating because it  would have been SOOOO easy to tie Lando's boring side trek into the rest of  the plot (brings vagabond into the battle, tips the balance in favor of the  Republic). None of this happened.<br />DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. If you want a  good Star Wars story, buy virtually anything else out there. Especially  Heir to the Empire, the Jedi Academy Trilogy, or The Courtship of Princess  Leia.	2000-03-31

The tactical aspect of the books were the worst depictions of  battles in Star Wars I have ever had the displeasure of reading, and most  of the time there never even was any fighting. Why is Han taken from the  trilogy so early? Why do I care if Luke finds a mother that isn't even his?  Why should I plunk down my hard earned money to pay for a book that fits so  nicely in a trash can or a bonn fire? <br />Buy Heir to the Empire or the Jedi  Academy trilogy instead.

Every now and then I have the displeasure to find out what happens when a writer publishes something that with a little touch up could have been a lot better. The New Rebellion is one such book. The plot was there, the  enemies were there, but something is missing. The plot involves yet another  Dark Jedi trying to kill everyone in the New Republic by putting a bomb  into every droid off the assembly line. It sounds okay, but as the book  goes on you realize how impractical this plot is. Kueller is a reasonably  frightening, if callow, enemy. He does everything right up to the point  when someone tries to stop him. Then he seems to shut down, and allow  himself to be slain. <br />The climaz was rather well done, actually, but the  rest of the book felt like it was just taking up space. Maybe the book was  about a hundred an fifty pages of information crammed into 300. The writing  also felt dry at times, like the author knew that the book wasn't turning  out properly, but didn't know how to fix it. Indeed, it feels like Rusch  knew what the beggining and end of the book were going to be, but didn't  have a clue how to connect the two. <br />If you can put up with pieces of  dry, boring writing here and there, you can find some fun in this book.  Otherwise, you should read the Jedi Academy Trilogy, or The Courtship of  Princess Leia.	2000-03-29

Unfortunately, these dogfights are  not very exciting, and the tactical element is BADLY flawed. The Rebels do  incredible amounts of damage, striking with all but total impunity at the  Imperial ships. This is especially noticeable when a single Calamari  Cruiser takes on a Super Star Destroyer towards the end and forces it to  retreat. The book had its moments, however, like the infiltration and  covert elements of the story. These were generally well written and  compelling, and they were the most exciting parts of the book. Also, the  attacks on the ending are unfounded. Anyone who scored a 7 on an IQ test  will be able to understand what happened, and I think that the way the  ending was setup throughout the book was artistic. Attacking the final  sequence because it doesn't tell you EXACTLY what happened (it MERELY  implies it throughout the entire book) is like saying that an author cannot  write: &quot;&quot;Very well, we will settle this with a coin toss.&quot;  The coin tumbled through the air.&quot; because the author never said that  anyone flipped the coin! The reader is expected to have passed a second  grade reading comprehension test. IF you liked the other X-Wing series  books, then this is a good book. If you did not(or did not pass that  Reading Comp test back in grade school), then this is best left on the  shelf.	2000-03-29

While it was only a little more plausible, I felt that it had a nicer writing style than the other classic. It had its moments, like when he first found  Friday, or went sailing around the island. I also thought that it had far  too much speaking and far too little action. Despite his having enough  ammunition to stave off the entire U.S. Army for a month, he hardly ever  fired a shot. He was rarely in much danger, and &quot;god&quot;  continuously grants him things that make his survival a hundred times more  easy. It often skips sections when he is in the most danger of starving,  like when he says that he would not get any food from his crops until the  third year of his imprisonment, and two pages later is eating corn he grew.  This leaves the reader wondering what he ate the entire time that he wasn't  eating corn. <br />Even with all of its failings, I found Robinson Crusoe an  endearing character. I was rooting for him to survive the whole time. There  were also stretches here and there where the book was hard to put down.  Even so, I would recommend that you should think about what you want in a  story before you buy this one. There are better books out there, like  20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.	2000-03-29

It is well written, powerful, captivating, and puts the Hardy Boys to shame. Holmes solves mysteries in a believable (if difficult) fashion  that never fails to grip someone from start to finish. The stories are so  well written, in fact, that when Sherlock Holmes &quot;died&quot; fans  responded by rioting in the streets of London. The Queen insisted that  Conan Doyle bring back his famous character, and so here he is. While we  might not be willing to riot in the streets if Holmes died today, we can  still feel loyalty towards the famous character, and the legacy that Conan  Doyle left behind in these books.	2000-03-29

What possible reason did you have of creating him as a character? Whould it not have been easier to use Kyle Katarn? Kyle is a Jedi, like Corran, he  has a cocky attitude (Though usually doesn't come across as being pompous).  He is a much stronger jedi than Corran is (he can actually PICK SOMETHING  UP using the force). He is also pretty easy to marry off to Jan Ors (Who,  incidently, like Mirax, is a pilot). So, why not simply reuse Kyle, I find  him much more easy to understand than Corran, plus he isn't so stupid as to  put a Cubit Zarchonia in his lightsaber (YOU, incidently, are the one who  can't spell, Mr. Stackpole).	2000-03-28

It combines a short book with illustrations that vary from strong to below average. It expands on the Dark Forces series of video games, and follows Kyle Katarn from his  days as an Imperial agent to becoming one of the most trusted agents of the  Alliance, to his days as a Jedi Knight.<br />The book had its moments, and  most of the illustrations did the games, and the Star Wars universe credit.  Unfortunately, there were some problems with the story (the sequence on the  asteroid was a bit questionable so far as realism goes), and the drawings  sometimes referred to the wrong pages. The book is better than its sequel,  Rebel Agent, but comes up short when taking on the finale to the series,  Jedi Knight. Buy that one instead, it isn't hard to figure out what's going  on, particularly if you have played the game.	2000-03-28

It is by far the best of the trilogy, which began with Soldier for the Empire. The novella is generally pretty good,  connecting chapters (levels in the game) pretty well, and developing on Jan  and Kyle properly. The plot is not too bad, and the illustrations are  great. The drawings alone make this the best of the series, but the plot  thickens as a bonus. Still, the novella fails to improve on some of the  other books failings. The long and drawn out lightsaber battles in the  movies and the game are shortened to just a few paragraphs in length, if  that. Maw's duel with the young Kyle lasted no more than three sentences,  and Selonia somehow manages to lose a battle she clearly has the upper hand  in. While not quite as dissappointing (or as humorous) as Gorc's demise in  Rebel Agent, the battles are still far too short for their own good, and a  character who ends up dying early is developed almost as fully as Jan and  Kyle are. Still, this is probably the best of the series, and a fine ending  the trilogy. If you don't have the other two, buy this one first to see if  this is the kind of book you want. It won't be very hard to catch on to  what happened in the others, and the money you save if you don't like it  will be worth it.	2000-03-28

His combat sequences are customarily slow, and lack the cutting edge necessary to make a really strong book. Stackpole finds a really strange need to make sure that  everything blows up in a different way, and spends paragraphs describing  what happens to a ship after its been hit by enough firepower to knock it  out of a battle. This I found rather boring, I can just imagine what  happens AFTER the ship gets hit. I also felt that Stackpole's efforts to  humanize the characters lacked something. I never really felt attached to  any of the characters other than Wedge. I found it difficult at times to  identify with Hobbie and Janson, not to mention the horde of characters  developed just for the books. The rebels are able to take down capital  ships without being touched by their guns, which raises the question of why  the Empire spent so much money building them to let them get destroyed by  snubfighters and their commanding officer's ineptitude. The Imperials are  typically stupid and underdeveloped, even Isard. Their tactics are weak,  and their motives are often questionable. Despite all this the book did  have some redeaming qualities. I liked the plot, and Stackpole gets the  technology in Star Wars, even if he hasn't mastered the tactics or  characters. I felt like he was afraid to write about Luke, Leia, Han, and  the others for fear of damaging their characters by not understanding them.  When he finally writes about the main characters, he writes mostly about  the characters that have been written about by other authors.	2000-03-28

A strong introduction, intermediary, and conclusion help make this book the greatest. Its villain, Grand Admiral Thrawn, is one of the greatest  villains ever created. He is frightening, cold blooded, and has terrific  eccentricities that make him more believable. What is most unusual, and  impressive about him is that he is INTELLIGENT. This is something that is  far too often overlooked when you read other novels. You actually grow to  respect him as the book goes on. You really have to read the books in order  to understand this respect, you respect him as a person, as an adversary,  and as an equal. His strategies are believable, well thought out, and  understandable. Some fellow readers even would go so far as to say that  they found themselves rooting for the Grand Admiral. The characters from  the movies are all there, believable as ever. Luke, Han, Chewie, Lando, the  droids, and Leia are all well portrayed, as well as several other  characters who you might have noticed in the backgrounds. None of the  intertwining plot lines ever even borders on confusing, and you are always  on the edge of your seat. When I first read this book, it was the first  Star Wars book I ever read. I went up to read the first few chapters, and  &quot;woke up&quot; hours later, having finished the book's entirety. You  can read any one of the trilogy as a single novel, or as part of the  greater picture. It is never difficult to catch on to the characters, or  their trials as they battle for control of a galaxy far, far away.	2000-03-28

Unfortunately, it is still smarting from  some of the problems that authors of this series refuse to correct. It  still has too many characters, presented to early to keep track of  properly. In fact, at some points even late in the book I could not  remember what species a character was! Its battles seem either too fast or  too slow, like when a Star Destroyer is reduced to ash in just a few short  pages, or when dogfights that should have lasted a few seconds at the most  drag on for quite some time. This problem, however, is not exactly the  author's fault, as the amount of information required to track multiple  ships in three dimensions is often difficult to compress. The major enemies  are still failing flight school, Isard included, and the Rebels often  inflict enormous casualties at very little cost thanks to impractical  scheming, luck, or a combinations of both. Even so, the plot was by far the  best from the X-Wing series, and compared to say, Wedge's Gambit, the other  problems don't show up as often.	2000-03-28

It combines all of the failings of the other books with a boring and unbelievable story. I didn't enjoy Tycho Celchu's problems dealing with the squadron's newest  droid (who in many ways is a clone of C-3P0). I also felt that the lack of  realism was mostly due to the complete stupidity of the Imperials and the  grossly imbalanced casualties that are handed out during battle. Has anyone  else played TIE Fighter, or X-Wing Alliance? There is more to blowing up  capital ships than flying in and lobbing proton torpedoes at maximum range.  The dogfights seemed slow and detracted from the very real threats to the  Republic by becoming so character driven. Corran (as usual) was rather  annoying, particularly when he drew attention away from the main  characters, and the major plot. This is one of the weaker ones of the  series, buy The Courtship of Princess Leia, or The Bacta War instead.	2000-03-28

This entire trilogy is amongst the best books ever written in the Star Wars universe. The characters continue their saga with great new locations (and a few that were mentioned briefly in the movies), enemies and allies.  The plot is generally convincing, and sticks to the tried and true Star  Wars universe. Kevin J Anderson is certainly a very good author, who  portrays the entire area faithfully. He obviously thought out this series  well before he wrote about it.	2000-03-28

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a book about an insane asylum in the mid part of this century. It is told in a distinctive style that lets you identify with the insane people (along with a few that are not quite so  crazy). You can genuinely feel the power in certain events, like when Chief  Bromden looks out the window for the first time. The reader is always on  the edge of his seat, waiting for something else to happen. Everyone I  recommend the book to gets something a little different out of it, which is  why this is such a tough review to write. You really have to read the book,  because there is no real way I can explain it to you. I would strongly  recommend the book to anyone who loves a good story.	2000-03-28

For those of you who are unfamiliar with the series, they collect short stories about characters who you may have seen in the backgrounds of the Star Wars  setting that they focus around. I loved the way that many of these tales  revolved around events that happened in RotJ, or reflected what happened  following the movie. This book had several very strong tales, including  that of Yarna D'Al Gargan, Bib Fortuna, and my personal favorite, the tale  of Malakili. The stories were kept short, but not to the expense of either  plot or character development. None of the stories were particularly  boring, but for some of them you have to be &quot;in the mood&quot;. Still,  the major stories in this are just great, and well worth keeping on your  bookshelf as a light read.	2000-03-28

The first person perspective in Star Wars is truly awful because as an author you cannot expand to include several of the characters. Corran (The main character) is always absent in the critical moment, like when he was conveniently gone when the Jedi apprentices  defeated the spirit of a fallen Dark Jedi. I understand that Stackpole was  forced to dance around the plot of the Jedi Academy Trilogy, but he fell to  his knees doing it. Also, Corran's enemies never make any sense, like when  a group of all powerful dark Jedi decide to aid a rogue imperial admiral  who has one Star Destroyer and a midget of an armada, rather than siezing  galactic power by themselves. Finally, while the characters are often in  danger, the New Republic is never in any trouble, which limits the scale of  the book. Buy the Jedi Academy Trilogy, by Kevin Anderson instead.	2000-03-19

TRULY uninspired combat that is made up for by a fragmented story line that never quite adds up. A terrible ending sequence, poor set up, and Han taken out of the action makes this trilogy not worth buying. In addition, if you are buying this  book and not the others in the trilogy, then be warned: Before the Storm  does not have a traditional ending. In fact, I'm not sure that its ending  tied off ANY loose ends. I kept expecting that something would come in the  next page or two that would salvage all fifteen hundred pages of the  trilogy, and it never came.	2000-03-19

The sequences with Anakin, and Jaina add to their characters. The only thing that I missed was Jacen and Like's  continuing debate about whether or not to reform the Jedi council. I was  surprised by Stackpole's faster, cleaner, neater depictions of combat, and  of his apparent mastery of the ground (after that idiot Corran decided to  put a cubix zarchonia into his lightsaber). I must say that though I have  not enjoyed many of his previous books, I am looking forward to X-Wing 9(?)  with Jaina as a member of Rogue Squadron.	2000-03-19

It took some time to set up, but once it got going it became an excellent novel. The book's major new enemy has great potential in the future, and acts as a clear foil  to the ususal band of characters that follow the storyline as it unfolds. A  must have for any Star Wars bookshelf.	2000-03-19

The dogfights are often long and drawn out, unfortunately, due to the innordinate amount of data that is required for the reader to be able to track just two ships in three  dimensions often makes them seem slow. Also, for some reason the authors of  the series find some inexplicable need to find a new way for every ship to  blow up. The series also suffers because of too many characters. A squadron  is made up of 12 pilots, plus support staff. Often many of these pilots  never do anything but sit in the briefing room. Also, the handling  characteristics of the different ships are often mismatched. This was  particularly noticeable when an X-wing manages to outrace an A-wing. The  Imperial commanders must never have graduated from flight school, and their  tactics match such a profile. This series had a strong idea, but an  incredibly poor execution.	2000-03-19
