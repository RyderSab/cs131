They had teamed up to track down a serial killer who brutally tortured his victims before killing them. They respected each other and worked well together. However, the case took a lot out them and they started to drift apart.<br />Several months have passed since this horrifying case. Carol Jordan has been promoted and now she is Detective Chief Inspector and in charge of her own group of detectives in the town of Seaford. They are currently working on a case involving a series of arson fires happening around town. Jordan's squad is reluctantly investigating the case until one person dies. Jordan shows them no mercy and works them hard in finding out who is responsible of creating those fires. She will take this case very personally before, during, and after the suspect is arrested.<br />When we first met Dr. Hill in THE MERMAIDS SINGING he was heading a task force studying the viability of using profilers in police investigations. It was decided that the project is a go and Tony is training a special group of police officers in investigative profiling techniques. The author introduces each one of the students and explains the reason why they decided to become profilers. One day Dr. Hill gives them an exercise involving the unsolved disappearances of several teenage girls all around the United Kingdom. Tony invites Carol to the class to see if she would lend her technical expertise to the class discussion. Most of the students take this project as regular assignment but one of them sees it as much more. She analyzes every single aspect of their disappearances and tries to find a unifying factor. What she discovers is so outrageous that she discusses it in the class. She is ridiculed but undeterred. It is not until someone in her class is brutally murdered that Tony decides to do his own investigation.<br />The reader learns the identity of the kidnapper and killer earlier on in the book before any of the other characters. We learn why he is how he is and why he does what he does. McDermid evens spends the time in giving developing the characters and learning what they are thinking to some of the victims before they are brutally murdered. It might be considered to be a bit sadist but just because they are characters in the book it does not mean that they cannot be disposable. Some readers might be upset with this but it helps to strengthen the plot.<br />Tony Hill, Carol Jordan and the students all have a personal stake in bringing the murderer to justice. He thinks that he is invincible. Eventually at the end of the book there is a showdown and the bad guy is stopped. The villain is one of the most evil characters in books right now probably second to Hannibal Lecter. The author opens the possibility of bringing this character back. It will be a pleasure to learn about the repercussions of this book in her next Tony Hill/Carol Jordan booked called THE LAST TEMPTATION. Even if the villain does not return it will be nice to find out what happened afterward even if it is only a few sentences.	2002-08-26
US	53045954	R9SCPXWCUMZDX	0786230142	214350841	Austin City Blue	Books	4	9	10	N	N	Zoe rhymes with Joe	Jan Grape is best known for writing short stories and editing mystery anthologies. AUSTIN CITY BLUE is her first novel and hopefully, the beginning of a promising new series.<br />Zoe Barrow is a member of the Austin Police Department currently assigned to working desk duty at her local precinct. A few days ago she was attending a sports event at a local arena when she heard the call requesting police backup. Officer Barrow went to the scene and found two officers wounded at the hand of a single perpetrator. When the suspect starts to make a move she shoots him even though she is not aware of his identity. A few moments later she learns that he was Jesse Garcia the man responsible of putting her husband in a coma.<br />Zoe does not trust her feelings. She is not sure if she shot Garcia out of doing her duty or just plain revenge. It does not help that she is confined to office work and the people at Internal Affairs are getting on her case. She manages to get distracted from all that when Avery Peppard, a friend of her husband, comes to her asking for help. He believes his wife is having an affair with a cop and that they are plotting to kill him. She does not know what she can do for him so she helps him find Jason Foxx, a private detective, to help him. It is not until an informant with a connection to Peppard is found murdered in a motel room that Zoe decides to get involved.<br />Ms. Grape writes a good novel that is heavy in character development. Zoe is a conflicted woman who is torn between what she knows and what she believes. She loves he husband very much but he has been in a coma for a long time. She is attracted to Foxx but does not want to betray her husband. The story is fairly good with several red herrings placed throughout the novel. The author leaves the door open for another book and it will nice to learn more about the life of Zoe.	2002-08-26

That is not the case with this collection. <br />Some of the stories, such as Lawrence Block's A BONE IN THE THROAT and Judith Kelman's ERADICUM HOMO HORIBILUS, involve characters seeking retribution after events of many years have passed. Other stories such as Joan Hess's CAVEAT EMPTOR, involve a woman who is taken advantage of and decides to get even in a deadly manner.<br />There are two stories that seemed misplaced in this book and they are Mary Higgins Clark's POWER PLAYS and Phillip Margolin's ANGIE'S DELIGHT. Granted they are two great authors but neither one of their stories could qualify as murder for revenge. The editor does treat us with a poem by Shel Silverstein titled THE ENEMY that talks about different ways of killing someone. Borrowing the title of Joan Hess's short story and buyer beware. The book's title is misleading and it might not be what you are looking for. Most of the stories are good but they just seem out of place in this collection.	2002-08-26

I read it	This collection of short stories is written by some of the best legal thriller writers around and Scott Turow edits the book. Unfortunately most of the stories are formulaic and very predictable. The book is good as a tool to discover authors one might have never read and hopefully finds one who is a great novelist. The best stories in this collection is Marcia Muller's Sharon McCone case KNIVES AT MIDNIGHT and the underrated master of the mystery short story Ed Gorman with THAT DAY AT EAGLE'S POINT.	2002-08-26

She is a writer for Lone Star Monthly and she has been obsessed in learning the truth about her father's death. For the last twenty-eight years she has spent her spare time investigating her father's alleged suicide at the expense of her job and her family. In Mary Willis Walker's latest novel Molly will finally learn the truth.<br />While covering a Texas bill for concealed weapons registration Molly sees Olin Crocker. Many years ago he worked as a sheriff and was in charge of investigating the alleged suicide of Vernon Cates. Molly believes that her father's death was murder and that Olin was paid off to look the other way. Molly also has a personal reason for loathing Crocker and it will be made clear further in the novel. This has motivated her to finally learn the truth once and for all.<br />The book has a second plotline involving Austin's homeless population. For the last few months Molly has been writing articles about the people she has met and trying to put an eye on the problem. One of the individuals she meets is Sara Jane Hurley who is better known as Cow Lady in the homeless circles. Cow Lady has kept to herself reciting Mother Goose rhymes. She spends the night under a deck and one day she learns overhears a plot to spray nerve gas in the Texas legislature before the concealed weapons bill is passed. Cow Lady does not know what to do and eventually tracks down Molly and asks for her help.<br />The reader gets to know a lot more about Molly than they did in THE RED SCREAM and UNDER THE BEETLE'S CELLAR. We learn why she became a writer, what drives her, and finally the truth about her father. Molly idolized her father for many years but in the end she will find out that he was just an ordinary person under extraordinary circumstances. Only time will tell how she will feel. The book's two storylines crowd each other and makes it feel like a tennis match. The nerve gas story seemed more like filler and the people involved do not seem real. It is good that the author brings social issues to her novel and that is what she should have focused on.	2002-08-26

He contacted several well-known and respected Floridian writers to participate in an unusual project. Each one involved would provide a part of a novel written chapter by chapter by a different author. Columnist Dave Barry began the novel by introducing us to a manatee named Booger, and then another author would continue the story.  Carl Hiaasen had the daunting task of taking all the loose ends provided by all the participants and creating a plausible conclusion to the story. This project has not been seen in several decades since Agatha Christie and other mystery writers worked on a similar type of storytelling. <br />During the last few years groups of authors have worked on similar projects like this and given their profits to charities. The problem is that some of these writers are not interested in writing a good story but finding a way to trip up the writer that is supposed to continue the plot. The only thing those authors share in common is the genre that they write. NAKED CAME THE MANATEE is better by the connection this particular group of people shares.<br />Most of the authors who worked on this book have lived in Florida for a long time. They know the area, its people and its customs and implement them in the story line. Some of the authors, such as Elmore Leonard, Dave Barry, and Carl Hiaasen, are funny in their own right that is perfect for this story. These authors know how to write a funny story and they can get away with it in this book. As a special treat for some of the book's readers is that some of the writers include their series characters in this novel. Among those making an appearance are Lee Standisford's John Deal and Edna Buchanan's Britt Montero.<br />Overall this novel is about a manatee that gets involved in a plot to discredit Fidel Castro. It is not Booger's fault. He just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time just like some of the other characters in this story. NAKED CAME THE MANATEE is not meant to be taken seriously so just sit down and enjoy the ride.	2002-08-26
US	53045954	R2ET89XRYUZS65	0515124524	343392598	Hot Chocolate	Books	4	6	8	N	N	A bit too sweet	This collection of short stories is about women who share personal insecurities but decide to do something about it. The authors of this anthology take their main female characters and transform them from wallflowers into seductresses. The other thing these stories have in common is the use of chocolate as a plot device serving as some sort of key point in the story.<br />The sweetest story (no pun intended) of the group is Lori Foster's TANGLED SHEETS. Sophie Sheridan is a business owner who goes to the Winston Tavern every day after work for a cup of hot chocolate. She is attracted to bar owner Cole Winston and she is comfortable with their friendship. She would like to go one step further but she does not want to jeopardize what she already has with Cole. She pretends to have a twin sister named Shelly and she uses this alter ego to do the things that she wishes that she could do as Sophie. If things do not work out she can go back to her safe routine. Cole is intrigued and attracted to Shelly but he is in love with Sophie. He is a bit hesitant around Shelly but when he learns about Sophie's deception he will give her a Valentine's Day she will never forget. Nice and sweet stories for a rainy day.	2002-08-26
US	53045954	ROU05MJV7IBKI	0446610453	224791004	My Scottish Summer	Books	3	3	5	N	N	No great Scots	Four romance novelists got together to write a short story that shows the beauty of Scotland. These stories involve clueless women who get their foot stuck somewhere and gets help out of their predicament by a long-haired highlander. At first they cannot stand each other and near the end of each story fall madly in love.<br />None of the four stories give a feeling about Scotland. It relies heavily on stereotypes and the lack of scenic pictures in the book does not help at all. One gets so upset with the female protagonists that the visual imagery of the their location gets lost in the text. One of the most poorly edited stories in this anthology is Connie Brockway's LASSIE GO HOME. Devlin Montgomery is helping American Toni Olson to find a kidnapped dog by giving her a ride on his motorcycle. Dev is physically attracted to Toni in her jeans and her seductive cowboy boots. One night they are staying in a room where they wind up playing strip poker. Toni has apparently lost her pants and is about to lose another hand. Devlin is staring at her thinking, `If he won another hand, what would he ask her to shed - shirt or fantasy-inducing boot?' My question is the following, have you ever taken off your jeans while still wearing cowboy boots? It is near to impossible without having them removed first.<br />There are probably better stories that bring the essence of Scotland into their plot but this is not one of them. This book might seem like a good idea at the time but apparently too little time was given in the making of it.	2002-08-26

Most of the stories are complex and it only creates confusion to his readers. Some of the stories are very disturbing in which we get inside the minds of madmen, such as the lead characters in ASHPUTTLE and BUNNY IS GOOD BREAD. The first story involves a kindergarten teacher who takes revenge out of something that happened in her childhood. The other story shows the evolution of a serial killer with the help of good old dad.<br />This collection of short stories is mainly for Peter Straub loyalists who enjoy reading his work. His novels are much better than his short stories. Try THE HELLFIRE CLUB or GHOST STORY for a real fun time.	2002-08-26

Sierra is book smart, loyal and no nonsense. She controls her boss, Vincent Gambuzzo, by hinting to her (non-existent) familial connections to a New Jersey Mafia boss known as `Big Moose' Lavotini. Ms. Bartholomew's books are filled with funny situations, a great supporting cast and a nice, cozy mystery. The author never makes her characters demeaning or condescending but after writing those fun books the writer decides to get a bit serious this time.<br />It is December and Christmas is just around the corner. Vincent Gambuzzo has lost the club during a poker game and is then accused of killing one of the players. Sierra is exploring her relationship with Detective John Nailor wondering if she has finally found true love. She is unhappy with the club's new management after changing its name to Big Mike's House of Booty that she decides to stage a walkout with the other dancers. Just when everyone needs her to help Vincent and save the club she has to fly to her hometown of Philadelphia to deal with a family emergency. This event will demonstrate how strong Sierra can be with herself.<br />In STRIP POKER, Sierra Lavotini has matured as a character after her adventures in the previous three books. We get to appreciate how she interacts with her entire family throughout their personal crisis and see the love that they share with each other. With the sole exception of Sierra's kooky neighbor Raydean, the comedy in this book is not so strong but that is all right. We get to see a major change in Sierra's life at the end of the novel making us wish that the next novel comes out soon. I guess it is time to read Ms. Bartholomew's other two novels that introduces Maggie Reid. It should be good.	2002-08-26

It was nice of the author to lead one of the supporting characters to take the limelight in order to expand their literary universes. Most of the time the only thing we learn about the secondary characters is what the series hero let us know about them.<br />Ten years ago someone who wanted to frame Whitey Dane, the local crime boss, killed the Randolph family in their yacht. The Looking Glass Man (as the readers know him) failed in killing Seth Randolph and made a crucial mistake in framing Dane. The boy is in the hospital being watched by his mother, who was divorced from Mr. Randolph, and by Detective Phillip Lefebvre who has made it his mission to save the boy. The two have made a friendship and confide in each other. When Lefebvre learns about a crucial mistake the Looking Glass Man made, he is left wondering if someone from his own police department could have been the murderer. Crucial evidence disappears and Seth is found murdered in his hospital bed. The police suspects Lefebvre was involved but he has now disappeared.<br />A decade has passed and a Cessna plane has been found in the forest. It contains the body of Phillip Lefebvre who apparently was killed by a tampered airplane. Frank Harriman gets the case and learns about the resentment the police force had on this disgraced officer. Dane is also interested in learning what has been going on. He is not happy that someone framed him for a murder he did not commit and wants to learn the truth.<br />Harriman is relentless in his investigation and his wife Irene lends him a helping hand. Frank learns about people who had a connection to Lefebvre and will help him in the investigation. The Looking Glass Man is panicking and he will do what it takes to prevent the truth from coming out even if it includes murder.<br />This book pales in comparison to Ms. Burke's previous novel, BONES, which one the Edgar Award for Best Mystery Novel. The book is a good read and it provides something new to Irene Kelly fans. The story told through a different point of view.	2002-08-26

All the stories are independent from one another. The only thing that links them all together is a Christmas theme.<br />The best story out of the four is Sherrilyn Kenyon's LOVE BYTES. It is story of two co-workers who are attracted to each other but their own personal insecurities keep them apart. Adrian is Samantha's supervisor and office relationships are discouraged. It is not until one of them is down and the other tries to cheer him up that their love blossoms. The story is nice and sweet even though there are some loose ends by the end of the story. This collection of novellas is fine as an escape after a bad or rough day but that's about it. It is not Masterpiece Theater	2002-08-11

Dr. Hill leads the National Criminal Task Force and together working with DS Jordan they are going to investigate a series of torture murders occurring in the northern town of Bradfield.<br />The author lets us go inside the serial killer's psyche by starting each chapter of the book with a sample of the murderer's diary. It might have been insightful for the book's readers were it not for Hill's analytical reports. McDermid provides all the excruciating details of the Doctor's writing as it is being presented to the cops investigating the case. Were it not for Val McDermid's other superb novels, one might be turned off by this book.<br />As a whole, the book is slightly above average. The author does a good job with her characterization of Carol Jordan and Tony Hill making us wish for more. They both have some issues that the author develops well. The mystery was good while it started but the ending seemed to be abrupt and anticlimactic. Hopefully, THE WIRE IN THE BLOOD will be better. After all, Val McDermid is still one of my favorite authors.	2002-08-11

Someone is targeting the dancers at the Tiffany Gentlemen's Club in Panama City. At first the police think that Sierra's nemesis, Marla, is trying to stop the competition by killing Venus Lovemotion and Frosty Licks. Sierra is not convinced that even though she hates Marla's guts she does not think that she is responsible and will do her best to find out.<br />This book is even more fun and the author provides more information about Sierra mainly why she moved from Philadelphia to work at Panama City. In DRAG STRIP we met one of Sierra's four brothers and here we meet another brother. He helps Sierra work the case by pretending to be Little Moose Lavotini, a well-known mobster. As far as Sierra knows she has no relation to Moose Lavotini but she uses this `familial' connection to help her control her boss, Vincent Gambuzzo, and to put fear at the person she believes to be the killer. She provides a unique touch to her investigation and at the same time helps her police boyfriend, Detective John Nailor. The book is filled with many laugh out loud moments and provides a nice twist at the end of this book. STRIP POKER is going to be a lot of fun.	2002-08-11

The author brings back Alex McKnight and the small town of Paradise located in Michigan's northern peninsula. McKnight is a former cop who retired after being injured on the job. He tried his luck as a private detective but after the incidents in the previous novel he just wants to put himself together and enjoy his life. Everything changes with a hockey game.<br />Vinnie LeBlanc, a friend of McKnight, drafts him as a goalie for an over-thirty hockey league. It is shortly thereafter that he meets Lonnie Bruckman, a player from the opposing team, who is physically abusive and stoned in drugs. They get involved in several altercations leaving neither of them in good condition. One night he meets Bruckman's girlfriend, Dorothy Parrish. She wants to hire McKnight in trying to get away from the abusive relationship and start a new life. He agrees to let her spend the night in one of the cabins he rents and to discuss it in the morning. The next morning she disappears.<br />When he confronts Bruckman he finds out that he did not kidnap his girlfriend. He is also searching for her because she took something that was not hers and he wants him back. Alex gets into it very deep when he learns that Bruckman is not a threat but someone else.<br />Hamilton knows how to write an entertaining story and he does a decent job here. There are certain parts in the book that did not make sense such as McKnight's involvement with the case. He could have let the cops do their job but instead he gets personally involved. The supporting characters are strong and interesting. A COLD DAY IN PARADISE is one of the best novels from a few years ago. This next work comes close but not quite.	2002-08-11

They were trying to arrest Tom Grayson on terrorism charges but things went drastically wrong. Tom and his then-pregnant wife, Gale are holed up inside a church trying to escape the police. When the police decide to storm the building Tom shoots himself and leaves Gale as a grieving widow.<br />Time has passed since the tragic event and Gale is moving up with her life. She is still living in the same village working as a writer and taking care of her daughter, Katie Pru. Her peaceful life will be shattered when Katie Pru's baby sitter is found murdered in a village road.<br />Chief Inspector Daniel Halford and Detective Sergeant Maura Ramsden are sent to Fetherbridge to investigate the murder of Lisa Stillwell. The main reason they were assigned to the case is because they participated in the failed arrest of Tom Grayson. They both have serious misgivings after they are convinced that Gale was innocent of her husband's crimes. They also remember the locals and the locals remember them. Hopefully, they will be able to solve the case quickly but that will not be the case. There is a lot of resentment with New Scotland Yard regarding their attack on the town and some of the townspeople hate Gale Grayson.<br />Ms. Holbrook does an excellent job with this novel by not creating flat characters. All of the major players are well-developed and they evolve as the story goes along. No one had a reason to hate 22-year-old Lisa Stillwell but as the investigation ensues we learn that that is not the case. The story is complex and well-structured with a satisfactory conclusion to the story. The author is clearly influenced by the works of P.D. James and her books do not disappoint.<br />Teri Holbrook's novels have been nominated for several awards, more recently an Edgar-award nomination for THE MOTHER'S TONGUE. The author knows how to structure a good story and hopefully we will see more of her Gale Grayson novels in the future. Her books deserve the highest possible recommendation.	2002-08-08

After her debut in Nancy Bartholomew's MIRACLE MILE, she is back to make us laugh and smile in her latest mystery. In DRAG STRIP, Ruby Lee Diamond has recently moved out of her parent's house in Wewahitchka to work at Panama City. Sierra takes Ruby under her wing and shows her the ropes of her profession.<br />In order to promote his gentleman's club, Vincent Gambuzzo sends Sierra and Ruby to the local drag strip to pose with the drivers competing at the day's races. While working there Sierra sees Detective John Nailor in the hands of another woman (the nerve!) and he is doing everything he can to avoid bumping into her. During that same day she overhears Ruby arguing with someone and then being beaten to death. Sierra arrives too late to stop it and the killer manages to escape. It affects her really hard because she saw Ruby as a friend and she is unable to confide in John Nailor since he is on the run from the cops. Lavotini is not going to take it sitting down and she will do what it takes to find out the truth. In the end she will be involved with religious zealots, organized crime and family secrets.<br />Ms. Bartholomew has another winner with this second book in the Strip series. Sierra is a likeable character who is smart, resourceful and is grounded by the unconditional love given to her by her friends and family. There is a lot of humor written in this book that does not divert from the main storyline. An exotic dancer was murdered and there is a killer tracking Sierra to try and find out what she knows. Several scenes could have been insulting if written by other authors but Nancy Bartholomew is a class act. She never belittles her characters and her books are a joy to read. It will be a pleasure to continue reading her next book in the series, FILM STRIP. She writes good and light books meant to be enjoyed and not taken seriously.	2002-08-08

The stories are all top notch and it stays with you after having finished them. Some of the best stories are THE CASE OF THE PIETRO ANDROMACHE by Sara Paretsky where she departs from writing a story in the first person and tries something new with one of V. I. Warshawski supporting characters; Loren Estleman's I'M IN THE BOOK which is a good starting point for readers not familiar with his character, Amos Walker; and Barbara Collins's SEEING RED about a woman who has a very bad day.<br />My favorite story out of this whole collection is Ed Gorman's THE REASON WHY. It is a story of a twenty-year class reunion in which a couple of students have been keeping a secret since high school graduation. They receive a threatening letter saying that they must confess to their crime. It is a very powerful and moving story. If you do not care for the authors involved in the project at least try Gorman's short story.	2002-08-05

GALLOWS VIEW is the first novel that introduces Peter Robinson's creation of Inspector Alan Banks.<br />Women are being terrorized in the small English town of Eastvale by a peeping tom who likes to stare at women while they undress. There has also been a series of robberies affecting this small town but the police start taking notice when they find the body of Alice Matlock. The police cannot help themselves to wander if this was the work of outsiders or if the peeping tom passion has gotten to be deadly. Inspector Banks is in charge of the case and is working together with Dr. Jennifer Fuller to try to help him understand the mind of the voyeur and to see if there is possibility that he could be dangerous.<br />This book is a police procedural that does not carry a lot of surprises or revelations. What makes this book great is how the author takes what could be considered an ordinary day in the life of a police officer and make it interesting. Inspector Banks has some personal problems and he is attracted to the doctor. He wants to yield towards temptation and he knows it would not be right. The author does a good job also in showing life in a small town by showing the townspeople and involving them in the story. He adds everything from a camera club meeting all the way towards two teens heading into a life of trouble. <br />As a first novel, it is a very good book and helped in the understanding of Inspector Banks. There are quite a few of the author's work that follow this novel and it will be a pleasure to continue reading them in the future.	2002-08-05

Holly's other relatives are not happy with her appearance since she now owns most of the Randall Estate. They want her dead and make it look like an accident in order to get their hands on the money.<br />If you have not read any of Tom Savage's novels you are in for a treat. Things are not what they seem. This book has its requisite twist and turns with a surprise ending. Unfortunately most of his novels carry the same formula. If you have never read his novels you will enjoy this one, if you read him before the surprise will be lost on you.	2002-08-05

Under false pretenses the murderer visits each victim's apartment, offers to sketch them at no cost and later slays them and poses them as famous paintings such as The Mona Lisa and The Birth of Venus. This monster shares a special connection with radio psychologist Teri Fields. The killer would call her when she was doing her show and taunts Dr. Fields by describing the murders and providing clues as to the relationship shared by the killer and the radio host. Detective Amiel `Touch' Benson is on the case and he will be relentless in the case. He starts to fall for the good doctor and it might endanger his career in the Los Angeles Police Department. Had he been shot this book's readers could consider it a mercy killing.<br />This is one of the worst novels ever written and published. How did this book make it over the transom? The author makes up too many rookie mistakes to have a serious career as a crime novelist. He overwhelms his main character with so many quirks and personal problems that he has no credibility as a character. He has two eyes of different colors; he is separated from his wife who suffers from extreme bipolar disorder; his boss hates him; he is in love with his partner, Detective Amanda Blaine; he is an alcoholic; he lacks judgment by getting intimately involved with his main witness of these deaths; and he got his nickname for his success at playing touch football. Yeah, right.<br />The plot of this book reads like a bad eighties television movie. The way the author describes a crime scene you would expect the cops to be able to solve it before lunch. What the author does is drag it on and on probably to fulfill his quota of book pages. He makes sure that his characters get plenty of sex and he tries to build everything up to a big shocking ending that does not surprise anyone. The writer uses a plot device that is so overused that it should be banned from any new mysteries or crime novels. If you have read Don Passman's THE VISIONARY, Edna Buchanan's NOBODY LIVES FOREVER or Sidney Sheldon's TELL ME YOUR DREAMS, among others out there, then you probably read all you need to know about the subject. There are better novels out there, keep searching.	2002-08-05

Both Lily and Shana are still traumatized by the events and they both disagree as to who raped them. Lily wonders if she has made a mistake now that there is a relentless cop investigating the case.<br />Nancy Taylor Rosenberg does a good job in applying what she knows in this novel. She has worked in law enforcement for many years and has dealt with sexual offenders. The victims and situations felt real as well as the emotional trauma Lily feels for her action. The novel reads like a Lifetime movie but it kept my interest.	2002-07-23
US	53045954	R3SVTHDIEXRX48	0316693200	309666534	2nd Chance	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Nice try	This book marks the return of Lt. Lindsay Boxer, Medical coroner Claire Washburn, San Francisco Assistant District Attorney Jill Bernhardt and Crime scene reporter, Cindy Thomas. In 1ST TO DIE, these four professional women band together to stop a serial killer targeting newlyweds during their honeymoon. As a group they were able to solve the crime and in turn become the closest of friends.<br />In this second book of the series, The Women's Murder Club (or the Margarita Posse, as they call themselves) join forces in stopping a serial killer targeting African-Americans. What at first seems to be a series of random hate crimes turn out to be something more sinister. There is a self-righteous serial killer calling himself Chimera who is killing the relatives of African-American cops. When Chimera shoots Lt. Boxer's boss, the gloves come off and the Women's Murder Club is back in business.<br />This book is weaker than the first novel. In the first book the authors focus on Lindsay Boxer who was feeling suicidal after learning she had a rare blood disease. There was very few details provided about the lives of the other three members of the group outside of their jobs with the sole exception of a confession given by Jill. In this current novel, Lindsay's condition is now in remission and she is stronger than ever. The character development of the other three is still slow. One of them gets good news that later becomes bad, one of them starts to date a witness to Chimera's crimes, and the last one gets her life threatened by this serial killer.<br />The book has its requisite twist and turns and it is a quick read. What would enhance this novel is if there is a change of viewpoint in each one of the novels. Lindsay told the story in books one and two. Let someone else take the reins in the next one. Just something to consider for the next time.	2002-07-21

He contacted several mystery writers asking for what they considered to be their best story as well as the best story they have ever read. The response was overwhelming and the editor collected some of them in this book...<br />In the first volume of this anthology the adage `less is more' can be applied to the best stories in the collection. Some of the best include Ed Gorman's EN FAMILLE and Joan Hess's ANOTHER ROOM. Ms. Hess's choice for best short story is Judith Garner's TRICK OR TREAT. It is about four pages long and one of the scariest stories ever written. It is not because of what happens in the story but what may happen. A sample of good writing is when the author forces the reader to use their imagination in order to create their own ending. There can be different interpretations but each one is precious. The imagination is a powerful weapon. The least favorite story in this book is Harlan Ellison's TIRED OLD MAN. The problem with this story is that Ellison describes the incident that inspired his story creating a carbon copy with fictional characters. Who wants to read a story twice?	2002-07-21

She is working with the Canadian police in a task force identifying motorcycle members bodies involved in a big gang war in Quebec. During the course of her work, she recovers the bodies of two bikers who have been missing for over ten years. While digging them up she discover the leg bones and skull of an unidentified young girl. The only clue Tempe has is an implant found in the girl's skull.<br />Once the girl's identity has been established Tempe discovers that the girl's other bones were found in South Carolina. How did a missing girl from South Carolina wind up in Quebec? Where was she killed? Tempe will learn the truth in the death of this girl and learn about a moment of hubris by the main bad guy in this book. Naturally, this book would not be anything if Dr. Brennan's life was not threatened. You can be sure it does.<br />It is clear that the author spent a lot of time and research in writing this book. There is more information on blood spatter techniques, motorcycles, and biker gang hierarchy to intimidate the amateur. She uses a lot of her forensic anthropology expertise with her alter ego, Dr. Brennan. There are several cases that the doctor works on that come together in a moment of serendipity. It is too much to let the reader rely on coincidence and leaps of logic in order to enjoy Ms. Reichs's novels.	2002-07-21

She does not preach but provide a few things that could go wrong when executing someone guilty of capital murder. In this novel she introduces Louie Bronk, a self-confessed serial killer, who in the next few days will be executed for a crime he might have not committed.<br />Molly Cates is a crime writer for Lone Star Monthly from Austin, Texas. She has recently published a true crime book chronicling the life of Louie Bronk and the murder of Andrea `Tiny' McFarland. As she prepares to follow-up with this story she is being deterred by the victim's husband as well as her boss no to proceed with the story. A few days later two people related to the McFarlands are brutally murdered. If this was not bad enough Bronk confesses to dozens of murders except the McFarland one. He has found religion and he is not going to confess to something he did not do. Molly hates to look like a fool after everything she went to write her book so she is determined to find out the truth. Everything she believed about the case will be shattered and she will do what she can to make things right.<br />Mary Willis Walker has a winner with this book. This is her first book in a series that will be a pleasure to continue to read. Her character development is very strong by showing everything she can reveal about Molly, warts and all. There are times when Ms. Cates is not sure about what she is doing that the author reflects on her weaknesses and her insecurities. This makes her appear more real to the reader and more appealing. THE RED SCREAM is pure enjoyment and hopefully her other novels will be just as good.	2002-07-16

Austin is taking a working vacation at the Black Sea after his previous adventure in BLUE GOLD. <br />While taking a test flight on an experimental plane he sees a television crew about to be attacked by a group of Cossacks. Doing his best Mighty Mouse impersonation he goes and saves the day. He will later learn what this attack had to do with a stolen American submarine and a tsunami that destroyed part of a small Maine town. NUMA will once again try to save the planet by having Austin team up with a former Russian enemy in trying to prevent a Russian mining magnate from creating a catastrophic terrorist act. <br />This book is a pleasure to read because the author brings back everything that is familiar to his fans. The authors make good use of well-known supporting characters from Clive Cusslers Dirk Pitt series. They include everyone from NUMA chief Admiral Sandecker all the way to computer expert Hiram Yaeger. There is a lot of action and humor throughout the novel and at times it can be educational. If you are not familiar with how tsunamis are formed you will be by the time you finish this book.<br />The villain in this work is stereotypical and one wishes that there were more character development in the story. The ending to this novel seems a lit bland after everything that happens here. The book can be entertaining if you do not over think it. Sit back and enjoy the reading experience.	2002-07-15

This book is not a sequel but a new standalone novel that includes a pair of characters from THE QUIET GAME. Before the story begins the author warns the reader to prepare for a wild ride and he is not kidding. Iles does this by creating a noir novel and placing it in The Twilight Zone.<br />Geologist John Waters is living a somewhat comfortable life. He lives in Natchez, Mississippi, has a successful business and a loving family. The only thing that is troubling him is that his wife is reeling from two previous miscarriages and the Environmental Protection Agency is looking hard at some of the work Waters has done. They are all regular problems that eventually will be solved. His life as he knows it will change one afternoon during his daughter's soccer game.<br />While watching the game he is entranced by Eve Sumner, a young real estate agent working and living at Natchez, who leaves Waters with a sense of deja vu. She sends him a signal only known to him and a former lover named Mallory Candler. What make this even stranger is that Mallory died from a brutal assault and rape that happened in New Orleans ten years ago. What is Eve Sumner's relationship with Mallory? When he finally meets up with Eve he is going to be flabbergasted with what she tells him. She reveals things that only Mallory and Waters could know and once she explains how she knows it will blow his mind.<br />Everything John took for granted is questioned and he becomes so obsessed with Eve that he is willing to give up his family to be with her. It is not until his family is threatened that he starts to put his life together. Things get worse when Eve's body is found strangled in a motel room and all the evidence points out to Waters. He is going to have to prove his innocence while trying to save his family from a clever trap.<br />Iles takes a complete departure from his previous writing style in writingthis novel. There is a lot that can be said about this book that will spoil the reader's enjoyment. Suffice it to say, there are some clever twists in this novel that will keep readers guessing. You will want to read this book quickly in order to appreciate its thrills.	2002-07-15

Forensic archaeologist Lindsay Chamberlain is in the town of Merry Claymoore, GA working with a group digging an old Indian site. Her work is briefly interrupted when the local town sheriff asks for Lindsay's expertise. The town recently uncovered the bones of a child and they needed to identify it. In order to promote good relations with the local townspeople Lindsay agrees to help. During the course of her novel the investigation will lead to a deep family secret kept hidden for several decades after the discovery of a more contemporary body.<br />What makes this book a joy to read is that Lindsay is not an amateur detective, she is an archaeologist. She is a professional who knows how to do her job and is able to see what others might overlook. She makes it look natural without going through any giant leaps in logic. She has a strong circle of friends that keep her grounded and the reader gets to see her day-by-day job at the archaeological site without making it seem boring. She knows how to keep it interesting by making it look like an ordinary thing.<br />Beverly Connor is probably one of the most overlooked mystery novelist around. Lindsay Chamberlain holds a lot of promise and hopefully her next novel will be just as enjoyable as this one.	2002-07-09

OPEN SEASON introduces Wyoming Game Warden Joe Pickett, a good family man with a strong moral compass. No matter what obstacles are put on his way he will do whatever it takes to put things right.<br />As the novel starts the body of Ote Keeley is found on Pickett's backyard. Keeley has been a thorn on Pickett's side for quite some time since he humiliated him while performing his job. The game warden has been made fun of due to this incident and nobody will let him forget it. Beside the body of Keeley there is a broken ice cooler and it seems that Ote wanted to show Joe something before he was shot.<br />During the course of the investigation several other bodies of people close to Keeley turn up dead. The main suspect is in critical condition at the hospital after a police shoot-out. Pickett is not convinced that they have their man so he decides to perform his own investigation. During his work he will find that his family, his job and his life are all in jeopardy.<br />Box does a superb job in keeping Joe Pickett real by introducing us to his family. They all love each other and will do anything for each other. They all share the same worries and struggles that plague the mind of this family man. If someone comes after his family, he is not going to show them any mercy. Joe's oldest daughter, Sheridan, has been hiding a secret since the body of Keeley was found and she will be playing an important role in the book's conclusion. <br />There are no easy answers in this novel. The conclusion of the case will bring a lot of unintended consequences to the small town in Wyoming that will probably linger in his future novels. If you like the novels of P. J. Parrish and Steve Hamilton you will certainly enjoy C. J. Box's debut novel.	2002-07-09

Now with the passage of time the USSR is nothing but a distant memory and the former republics are fighting hard to keep their independence. Reading Martin Cruz Smith's novel now gives a unique perspective to life in this foreign land.<br />We are introduced to Russian Homicide Detective Arkady Renko who is investigating a triple homicide in Gorky Park. All of the victims were shot and they were intentionally disfigured in order to prevent identification. The only clue left on the scene were a pair of ice skates worn by one of the victims that belonged to actress Irina Asanova. Renko must deal with petty bureaucrats, crooked politicians, the KGB as well as his own personal problems with his own wife.<br />Irina knows more than she is telling the detective. Renko is smitten with her and he is not confident about his feelings. The other major player in this novel is an American furrier named John Osbourne. This businessman has strong connections with Soviet officials and it is believed that he is also a KGB informant. Several Russian officials are protecting him but Renko is not to be dissuaded. He will do what he needs to do in order to get to the bottom of this mystery.<br />Cruz's work is very powerful and strong in character development. Each one of the three major characters has a story to tell and the author does a great job in developing each one. It is a story of heartbreak and broken dreams and definitely one of the best novels ever written about Russia.	2002-07-09

The Russian is angry with Mercer for foiling his plan in VULCAN'S FORGE. He was forced to flee from Russia but not before stealing several Top Secret documents pertaining to Cold War plans. CHARON'S LANDING is one of the plans.<br />This latest scheme involves creating the biggest man made disaster in recorded history making the Exxon Valdez spill seem like spilt milk. Kerikov enlists and bankrolls a radical environmentalist group without telling them of his hidden agenda. The Russian is also teaming up with a group of Middle Eastern mercenaries for reasons that will be made clear later in the novel.<br />Mercer gets involved in this debacle through unforeseen circumstances. Together with a group of friends he witnesses a shipwreck that was not meant to be found. Kerikov in his haste orders everyone killed in order to prevent them to ruin his plans. Had he left them alone Mercer would have not been involved and therefore there would not have been any novel.<br />This book was a major disappointment compared to his previous novel. There is a lot of action, humor and suspense but the author went a bit overboard. There were several scenes of graphic violence in this book that seemed to be a bit gratuitous. The author can accomplish this better if he lets the reader's imagination take flight. We do not need a play by play action. Anyone who reads CHARON'S LANDING as their first Du Brul novel might be leery of trying his other novels. Only time will tell.	2002-07-09

Several ships have disappeared near the island of Hawaii including a NOAA ship where Mercer would have been part of the crew if not for prior commitments. In that ship is Mercer's mentor's daughter Tish Talbot. She is the only survivor of that shipwreck and there are people who want to kill her. Out of a sense of obligation Mercer becomes her bodyguard until he can figure what is going on.<br />In the island of Hawaii a civil war is beginning to brew. Takahoru Ohnishi is one of the most powerful men in Hawaii. He controls the cops as well as several government officials and is currently bankrolling a coup attempt. Ohnishi is a racist who wants to break out of the United States in order to give Hawaii its own independence and be able to do business with the Japanese. The reality is that all of this is a diversion to what is really happening in the Pacific Ocean. It is a Russian top secret plan that has been set into motion fifty years ago and it is now coming to fruition.

The neighbor's daughter, Evelyn is missing as well as Annie, her grandchild. If they do not show up within the next few days the neighbor will lose her house which she put into collateral in a child custody bond. Evelyn's former husband will be glad to collect and he has not made it a secret. Stephanie will try to do what she can since she is a bounty hunter and not a detective.<br />What have we learned from the other seven novels? Stephanie has bad luck with cars, she is always way over her head, and there is a skip tracer who always manages to make Stephanie look like a fool. This novel is no different. There is little emphasis put in Evelyn's story in order to make room for Stephanie's misadventures. The ending of this novel seemed to be rushed and the story does not have a clear resolution as to why Evelyn disappeared. The story that Evelyn gives Plum sounds a bit bogus and unconvincing.<br />Anyone who has read Ms. Evanovich's previous novels will read this book no matter what anyone else says. It is just that it is about time for Stephanie to grow as a character and be able to do something that is important and meaningful to her besides Tasty Kakes and sex. There is much more that the author can explore with this character and hopefully it will happen in the future. It is time for Stephanie to be involved in a case with very high stakes whether they are personal or emotional. She is always bumbling until she gets the job right. Why not let her do something that she can be proud of? Maybe it is just wishful thinking.	2002-07-08

Meridian Airlines is the worst airline in the world. The author amalgamates airplane passenger's worst nightmares into this fictional airline making them glad that they are not on this flight. The ticket counter people are poorly trained, the airline stewardesses are rude, and the pilots are so inexperienced they should not even be flying yet.<br />On Meridian Flight 6, everything that can go wrong goes wrong and most of the crew could care less. There are only two sympathetic people on this flight. Co-pilot Garth Abbott is trying to make sense of Captain Phil Knight's erratic behavior and stewardess Janie Bretsen is trying to control head stewardess, Judy Jackson who is acting very rude and almost injured a child. Ms. Jackson hides in the cockpit in order to avoid an assault by outraged riders. <br />Dr. Brian Logan is one of the passengers on this flight. He is on this flight as a last resort because no other flights were available to take him to his destination. Several months ago, Logan's wife was on a Meridian flight and she was having complications with her pregnancy. She begged for the plane to land in order to go to a hospital but the crew refused. She died during the flight and now Logan is involved in a multimillion lawsuit against the airline. The events on this particular flight will force him to lead a mutiny against the captain in order for them to reach their destination safely. The problems on this flight are numerous to mention.<br />Nance uses his novel as a forum to regulate airlines by offering comments and suggestions throughout his characters. Some of the passengers on this flight have a unique story or reasons to be on this flight. The author does not develop them at all deciding to mash everything at the end of the book. Mr. Nance does know how to write an airplane thriller but it is very hard to relax with this novel. The outrageousness of this flight was a bit too much and can easily rise anyone's blood pressure with this airline's negligence. Do not give up with this author; try any of his previous novels like HEADWIND and BLACKOUT. They are better novels.	2002-07-08

FBI Agent Pendergast needs to investigate the site before the building owner destroys it. He enlists the reluctant aid of archaeologist Nora Kelly to survey the site. What she uncovers is a slaughterhouse of human victims used in some mad experiments by 19th century Dr. Enoch Leng. Dr. Leng was studying a way to prolong human life by experimenting on other people regardless of the consequences. Later the characters will be asking themselves, was Dr. Leng successful?<br />A few days after the grisly discovery was done someone is continuing the work the Doctor left behind. Several victims have been attacked and mutilated the same way as the bodies found at the construction site. Pendergast is left with a quandary. Is there someone copycatting Dr. Leng's work or is Dr. Leng doing it himself? Once the truth is revealed it will have terrifying consequences to Pendergast and the rest of the world.<br />The authors of this novel know how to entertain its readers. Preston and Child know how to create action and suspense by having the reader guess with the characters as to what is being unfolded. Several characters from other novels make their return appearance in this book giving it a sense of familiarity to the authors' fans. The plot in this book is a bit predictable and there are several clues provided throughout the novel. The ending is a bit anticlimactic when one expects there to be more to the story. Despite all this, the authors fulfilled their objective which is to entertain.	2002-07-08

What makes this phenomenon so unique is the size, weight and properties of the object. The existence of this mysterious rock has been unknown for millions of years until it was discovered by Nestor Masangkay. For some reason while the scientist is studying the rock a bolt of lightning hits and kills him. It will be a while before anyone expresses any interest to what happened in Isla Desolacion in Chile.<br />Palmer Lloyd is the seventh richest man in the world. Whatever he wants, he gets. It does not matter what he has to do in order to get it. He will buy out, outbid or steal in order to fulfill his wishes. He is interested in the meteorite and he wants it no matter if it creates an international incident. Palmer hires a troubleshooter who in turns hires a group of disgraced professionals who see this mission as their last shot at redemption. The doomed crew will go to Chile, get the rock, and then get involved with a mad captain of the Chilean navy. The story has a lot of action and suspense but it is all for naught. The story does not finish with this novel that has an ending reminiscent of the Twilight Zone or R. L. Stine novels.<br />Out of all the Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child novels this one is definitely the weakest link. The characters are complete stereotypes that we do not learn much about until it is too late. Some of the characters previous acts are put into question that are not particularly cleared up. Sam MacFarlane had a falling out with Nestor Masangkay in the past and the story is not clear. The ending is open-ended leaving a chance for a sequel to pop up. It might answer some questions or not, only the authors will know. Try reading their latest work THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES. It makes up for this one.	2002-07-08

It is 1952 and the Miranda warnings are still about two decades away from being implemented. Albert Jay Smalls is being sustained by the police in suspicion with the strangling murder of a child named Anna Lake. The homeless man has been seen in the vicinity of the victim at the park so the cops take him in for questioning. The police have twelve hours to find evidence against Mr. Smalls or be forced to let the suspect loose. Detectives Jack Pierce and Norman Cohen are responsible for interrogating Mr. Smalls. They are both convinced that they have the right man but when morning comes their lives will be irrevocably changed.<br />Thomas H. Cook knows how to attract reader interest by creating this haunting story. The murder of a child will always affect everyone around including the cops investigating the case. Pierce and Cohen have a personal stake in solving this murder. The author demonstrates this by going inside the main characters psyches and showing what is inside. Cook enhances the experience by introducing other people that have a tangential link to the crime. Among them is Eddie Lambrusco, a garbage man, who is forced to work on a night his daughter is sick and home alone; Chief Burke is at the hospital keeping a deathwatch over his drug-addicted son; and a petty criminal is running a fencing operation. All these characters have a purpose within the novel and the author does an excellent job in integrating the stories into its satisfying conclusion. THE INTERROGATION is a good novel that should not be missed. It is no wonder that Thomas H. Cook is one of the best mystery novelists of the United States.	2002-06-17

They lie and trick them and get drunk and stoned during business hours and they find ways to screw their customers.

DS Peter Diamond is sent to investigate what appears to be a cold case since the bones have been buried there for over two decades. He is not confident that he will be able to solve the mystery but he is going to try. Joe Dougan, an American English professor, is visiting Bath to fulfill his literary quest. He is so obsessed with literature that he is trying to track down the former home of author Mary Shelley where Frankenstein was supposed to be written. He is relentless in his quest and he attracts unwanted attention. Somebody has been hiding a secret for over twenty years and he is willing to kill in order to keep it a secret.<br />Lovesey knows how to entertain the reading by bringing in humorous characters that are acting some form of stereotype. The author also provides several red herrings that are meant to distract the police. When the story reaches its unexpected conclusion one can appreciate how well the author structure the plot by leaving no loose ends. Peter Lovesey's book was fun to read.

Tempe will see a gruesome scene that is only going to get worse. She will be facing an apocalyptic cult that might have a hold on her sister, Harry.<br />There is not much to say for this novel. The author relies heavily on coincidences as well as plot conveniences to tell the story. Every single body that this doctor investigates in the book will be related to the Montreal arson investigation. The author makes sure that Tempe meets all the principals in the case so that she can solve the crime. If one wanted something this simplified, they would just watch MURDER, SHE WROTE.

In Lincoln Rhyme's latest novel he is helping the FBI and the INS to track a hired killer and human smuggler known as `The Ghost'. Rhyme tracks the assassin to a Chinese freighter that is bringing two dozen illegal aliens to the United States. When the Ghost finds himself cornered he blows up the ship and manages to escape. He does not want any survivors and kills anyone he can find. The lucky ones manage to pass by the Ghost and escape to Chinatown. The killer cannot let them live and he will use every single connection he has to kill them.<br />At first the Ghost's motivation for killing the undocumented survivors is elusive. It does not make much sense throughout the story. It is not until the end of the story that Lincoln Rhyme and his assistant, Amelia Sachs, pulls a rabbit out of the hat and manages to explain everything. Deaver brings in his trademark twist that gives the book its satisfying conclusion. The author does a good job with his characters by adding more dimensions to them in each particular book. The focus in this novel is with Amelia who is concerned about Lincoln as well as her health. She befriends one of the refugees who helps her come to terms with some of her issues. Deaver always brings something new to his series that is always appreciated. One should also try Deaver's stand alone novels like A MAIDEN'S GRAVE for the serious reader or THE DEVIL'S TEARDROP for fans of the hard boiled mystery. Whatever the case, it is always a treat.	2002-06-10

Sometimes it is good to read a short story anthology to familiarize yourself with authors who might not be on the best seller list. Most of the stories are fairly average and do not really stick out. <br />The best story in the collection is John L. Breen's Four Views of Justice. The author takes a page from Faulkner and writes a story told by five separate characters all in the first person. Mr. Breen pulls it off brilliantly. Other short stories to watch out for are 'The Bad Boyz Klub' by Doug Allyn and 'The Oath' by Marilyn Wallace.	2002-06-07

He is desperately searching for his daughter who has gone missing for several weeks now. He had hired Jay Becker, Patrick Kenzie's mentor, to find Desiree. Mr. Becker does his job and when he is ready to report to Mr. Scott he disappears. Trevor kidnaps Angie and Patrick since they were not taking his calls or accepting any new cases. He tells them that he is dying and he needs to see his daughter one last time. Mr. Scott believes that Desiree is still grieving from the death of her mother as well as her boyfriend so that she alienated herself from her family. He also tells them about Jay's disappearance. Patrick and Angie are intrigued and take the case. They forgot only one thing. Just like in most mystery novels, the client does not tell the private investigators the truth and that is just the case here.<br />What follows is a roller coaster ride that sends Kenzie and Gennaro to a cult, a fraud scheme, and warped family values. These two classic characters are witty and a joy to read. Lehane takes them out of their Dorchester neighborhood in Boston and sends them to sunny Florida. They hate it because they do not know anybody in town. It will make the job of finding Desiree and Jay a bit harder but they manage. Once they find Ms. Stone the reader learns that she has a lot of issues with Daddy. She will do whatever it takes to get even. This novel had one of the best endings in which all the villains get their just desserts. You cannot help yourself in rooting for Angela. Patrick then decides what to do with the crooks with a devious plan.<br />This book is second best to GONE, BABY, GONE, and it is highly recommended. Bubba even makes an appearance on this novel before having to spend a year in jail.  He is always a hoot. If you have never met Bubba Rogowski now is the time. You do not want him to come over to your house to introduce himself.	2002-06-06

Things get a bit worse when it appears that a popular rock singer is the next victim of the killer the press has dubbed Guess Who. When it turns out that it was not the singer but somebody else the town council demands results from the local police department.<br />Mr. Malone does an excellent job in telling this story. He pays attention to every single one of his characters and each one of them brings an element to the plot. The characters range from the politician who is obstructing justice, the policewoman who wants to be there for her Chief but also there for her niece, and the news reporter who loses her job after one of her stories prove to be false. The reader gets to know each player in this book intimately and gets to laugh and cry together with the protagonists. The plot is well executed and a joy to read. Malone does not concentrate solely on the Guess Who killer but also on the town's day to day. The author has a great grasp of language and makes the story interesting at all times. This is my first Michael Malone novel and it will not be my last.	2002-06-06

Clara knows of only five people who would want her dead and she is going to track each one and make sure they are dead. They took her last chance at happiness and she is not the forgiving type. Nobody is going to get on her way.<br />Lucas Davenport is back and ready for action. He faced Clara once before and he is ready to do it again. After all these years he still remembers her. He knows and understands how this hitwoman was created and all he feels is sympathy for her. He wants to help her because he does not want anyone else to get hurt. Clara does not care at this point as she relentlessly tracks her prey.<br />In the thirteenth novel of the series, Sandford appears to be taking the books to a new direction. Davenport's boss is leaving the police department and wants him to join her; Del and Sherrill have minimal roles in the book; Weather is pregnant and engage to Lucas; and Davenport is now investigating crimes outside of Minneapolis. The story's conclusion is disappointing. It almost appears that the author is trying to clean the slate with regards to his main character. Hopefully, this will be a change for the better but only time will tell.	2002-05-29

He is losing his recollections of his wife, so before it disappears in the black waters of his mind he will find out what really happened.<br />Parker writes a touching and heartbreaking story that touches every one of his characters.

One thing leads to another and Dr. Reinhardt starts to hit Rachel. Marty says he could not take it anymore and goes to her defense. The story is purposely ambiguous at this point leaving the reader to wonder, what really happened?<br />Ellis relies on the first-person present tense to relate the story. In this case this is Marty Kalish's story. The only thing one can't help but wonder -is he telling the truth? Is there a real relationship between Rachel and him? Is he a stalker? These are the questions readers ask themselves as they try to unravel the story.<br />Marty is subsequently arrested and he goes into the trial. It is here where the reader gets to learn more about the life of Mr. Kalish as well as his personality. He is arrogant and full of himself for which the reader will feel little sympathy for him. The case then has its requisite twist and turns until it's final conclusion.<br />Ellis won the 2002 Edgar Award for Best First Novel. The story is a noble effort with this type of narrative; however there are other authors who pull it off successfully. The first is Tom Savage's VALENTINE and SCAVENGER; the Grand Mistress is Agatha Christie with the classic works ENDLESS NIGHT and THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD.

Klaus Felsen has just been recruited by the SS to go to Portugal and try to acquire wolfram (tungsten) from the Portuguese mines to ship to the Third Reich. The Nazis will use this metal to reinforce their armored tanks and to make bullets. The plot takes several decades to relate and it flips back and forth to the story line. One has to be fully determined to read the entire novel in order to see the relevance but by then one does not really care. The conclusion is disappointing when one has great expectations for this work.<br />The author concentrates too much on visual imagery that he forgets the story. Several of the scenes were redundant and the characters have no real depth. They will be portrayed one way at the beginning of the novel only to have them do a complete one-eighty on their personalities. The best example of this is the way Coelhos daughter is portrayed  from an innocent teenage girl to a rebellious child. Where did that come from? The author should concentrate on writing one story and sticking to it instead of making it up as the story goes. The book is a big continuity problem with no end in sight.	2002-05-25

The rest of the book is just a pleasure read. The kidnapper is easy to figure out. He is smart and resourceful always ready with a backup plan. He makes sure by the end of the novel to leave Ms. O'Dell with a small gift forcing the book to go into a sequel.	2002-05-25

According to him he has not lost any case where the defendant was innocent and he has won every case where the defendant was guilty. Judge Leopold Rifkin feels that Antonelli needs a lesson in humility so he gives him a pro bono case.<br />Johnny Morel is accused of raping his twelve-year-old daughter, Michelle. The prosecution's case is weak and the chief prosecution witness is the girl's drug-addicted mother. Joseph wins the case but everything here is far from over. Several years later, Johnny is found murdered and his wife is the chief suspect. Antonelli does not defend her and she winds up serving a prison term. After she is released from serving her sentence she is found shot dead in the home of Judge Leopold Rifkin.<br />Buffa does a great job with character development and he keeps the story line moving. The Morels have a deep connection to the judge and unbeknownst to Antonelli, he also shares a connection with the victim. As Buffa's first novel it is a great start. One can see why he was nominated for his last paperback, THE JUDGMENT, an even better work.	2002-05-15

She receives a call from a Mr. Houratanian who demands to speak to her partner Mike. Meg has not heard from Mike in days and is afraid to learn what he has cooked up now. In order to distract herself from her thoughts she offers to help. The caller lets her know that his son has been kidnapped and he does not want to involve the police. Once she arrives to the scene she discovers that the police had already arrived and Mr. Houratanian has no idea what is going on. He says that no kidnapping has taken place and that all this was a mistake. Meg should have just ignored the situation but instead she decides to put her two cents and try to figure out what is going on.<br />Ms. Songer's character is very annoying. The author considers herself to be the next Virginia Woolf by having us learn everything through Meg's stream of consciousness. The reader is expected to catch up and the heck with everything else. One of the most perplexing scenes involve her mentioning a character named Josh. It is not until sixty pages later in the book that we learn that Josh is her stepson. Is it so hard to say `my stepson, Josh' when first introducing him.<br />The title of the book is misleading. It is not until three-quarters of the book that any reference is made in using Meg Gillis as a lure. The Bait here is getting people to purchase her book.	2002-05-15

A Pennsteel helicopter has crashed with a private plane right over Alpine Valley, an amusement park. What makes this bad is that Dana was talking on her cell phone to her client who was in the helicopter. What makes it even worse is that her two daughters were at a field trip at the amusement park.<br />She wastes no time and rushes to Alpine Valley to look for her children. Once she ascertains that they are fine she gets to work. Dana starts collecting evidence and taking pictures of the site for the class action lawsuit Pennsteel is likely to face. There is someone who does not want her to succeed and it will do whatever it takes to stop her. The story gets intense and has an O. Henry twist at the end of the novel.<br />When the story reaches its resolution the author uses the novel as an editorial for class action lawsuits. She writes how big companies are forced to make budget costs in order to pay for lawyers defending them in all kind of lawsuits. Ms. MacDougal makes some interesting points but all this rhetoric loses the entertainment value the book might have had.	2002-05-15

He took a temporary job as a deputy in order to continue his law enforcement career. During one of his patrols he finds the body of a black man that was lynched approximately thirty years ago. Most people in town want to keep the past buried by making him a John Doe; Kincaid wants to identify the victim and give him justice.<br />This is the first novel for the sister team of P. J. Parrish. Their main character is a conflicted young man with a strong sense of responsibility. Deputy Kincaid is going to explore Black Pool's dark history in order to find out the hidden facts. He will defy the town's authority and discover the truth even if it costs him his life. Once he starts there is no turning back.<br />The authors do a great job with characterization. They show the town's diversity by including the town's rich white people all the way to the poor African Americans. There are times that they go overboard showing the community's racism that it almost falls into a stereotype. One dislikes the characters before one even knows them. The story is thought provoking and a good start to the series. DEAD OF WINTER follows DARK OF THE MOON and does a good job of it.	2002-05-15

Once she finds who the culprit is, she is back in business and the manhunt begins. Eve is afraid that the murderer is going to target her husband, Roarke.

There are times when the plot gets a bit intense but the author knows how to make it fun. You can bet that Eve will find Julianne. You can be sure that there will be a showdown near the end of the book that will have the reader cheering.<br />J. D. Robb (a.k.a.

Eve lets Peabody, her aide, work a cold case; the reader gets to see a personal side of Dr. Mira, the police psychiatrist; and we get to see more of Eves past as well as her relationship with her Irish soul mate and husband, Roarke. There are times the book gets to be mushy but that is one of the reasons one enjoys Ms. Robertss sci-fi, romance, police procedural series. The other reason is the humor she puts with Eves relationships with the supporting characters.

According to federal law - at least in the book - if an account has been inactive for more than seven years the money gets transferred and becomes property of the United States government. While performing his job, Oliver finds a three-million-dollar account belonging to a Martin Duckworth. After careful research he discovers that Mr. Duckworth is dead and there are no heirs to be notified. Who is going to miss the money? When he confides to his brother what he found Shep, an agent from the Secret Service, discovers him. Shep agrees not to report them if they give him a cut of the profits.<br />After careful planning to cover their tracks Ollie transfers the money to an offshore account and all hell breaks loose. Rogue Secret Service agents shoot Shep and the Caruso brothers are running for their lives. When Oliver checks the balance in the account he finds there are three hundred and thirteen million dollars stashed instead of three million dollars. The Caruso brothers go to Florida, the last known address for Mr. Duckworth, and try to figure out what happened. Meltzer brings in a ridiculous conspiracy involving computer viruses, fraud, and Disney World. Was it so hard for the author to come up with a fictional theme park?<br />If you have read one Brad Meltzer novel you have read them all. They all have the same formula and except for some slight deviations they all turn out to be the same. A young and naïve professional discovers a conspiracy. Instead of reporting it they decide to investigate and find out that it is something way over their heads. Anyone they get close too gets hurt or dies.

In the previous novel we learn that Quincy's daughter, Amanda, is in a coma after a car accident. The circumstances involved in the accident are explained in the first chapter of the book. There is someone with a vendetta against Quincy and he is going to destroy anyone close to him. He manipulated the situation to cause her daughter to die in the car accident and he is planning for his next victim. Quincy is not convinced with the accident ruling and hires Rainie Conner who is now working as a private investigator. She works together with Quincy trying to save his surviving daughter, Kimberly. <br />The story is predictable, character development is weak, and the killer's victims should have worn a bull's eye on their foreheads. The reader knows which characters are going to die and the author just drags it on and on until the the merciful release is done. Here is an example. There is a conspiracy involved in the Quincy vendetta and one of them is this girl. She calls the conspirator who tells her that she is being watched by a private investigator hired by Rainie. She asks what should she do and he tells her not to worry. He is going to messenger her some chocolates for her to offer the investigator. 'Just sit down with him, tell him you know what he is doing and offer him a chocolate. If he does not take one make sure you eat one of the chocolates'. 'Are they poisoned?' she asks. 'Of course not!' he says. Suffice it to say she believes him and you can guess what happens next. <br />If you want to read a better novel with a similar plot device try Dennis Lehane's PRAYERS FOR RAIN. The mastermind is much cleverer than the one in this book. He does not insult the reader's intelligence, something Ms. Gardner might not be aware that she is doing. THE THIRD VICTIM is her better work.	2002-04-23

Just as they were getting ready to depart EuroAir Flight 42 is told by ground control to stand by. One of the stewardesses finds out through a friend at the terminal that the Greek authorities are preparing to serve an international arrest warrant on one of its passengers, former U. S. President John Harris. Capt. Craig Dayton does not like what is about to transpire so he creates an international incident by taking off from the runway without air traffic control clearance. <br />Peruvian president, Alberto Miraflores has evidence that Harris ordered the death of Peruvian citizens while being president of the United States. Using the World Court system he manages to get a warrant that will force every country to extradite John Harris for the torture and deaths of Peruvian citizens. The president is unaware of giving the orders and retains the legal services of Jay Reinhart, an expert in international law. The flight crew races around the clock trying to find a safe place to land while Reinhart uses his legal expertise to figure out how to quash the World Court subpoena and find out the truth as to what happened in Peru. <br />Inspired by the news coverage of the extradition hearings for former Chilean Dictator Augusto Pinochet, Nance shows what can happen when a government goes too far in trying to punish foreign leaders. Every aspect of this book has been thoroughly researched in order to make this a realistic courtroom drama. Nance knows how to attract reader interest with his novels and this one is no exception. It is an edge of your seat thriller combined with a courtroom drama. What more could you ask for?	2002-04-23

In order to be able to make sense of it all he hires psychiatrist Claire Daniels to help him understand what happened. They uncover a conspiracy involving many players as well as a personal vendetta by one of them.<br />I read and enjoyed most of David Baldaccis novels except this one. The story dragged on for too long and I felt things could have resolved in fewer pages. There is too long a gap between characters and there were several setups in the novel which were a little too convenient. The book in itself has no ending. There is a conversation between Web and his psychiatrist in which he feels that he was betrayed. So he storms out. Will there be a sequel? Probably. Hopefully Baldaccis next work will be better and stronger. For anyone who has not read this author before I strongly recommend THE WINNER and THE SIMPLE TRUTH.	2002-04-23

One night he is asked to come to a restaurant where a massacre had just taken place. He noticed that things were not what they seemed. There were no stray shots taken in the restaurant and every single bullet used had hit a target. He is convinced that this was not a random act of violence and he tells the police that this appears to be a contract killing. The shooter enjoyed the carnage and had no compulsion on murdering innocent bystanders. <br />One of the victim's relatives is convinced that his son was the target and he is prepared to pay Milliken one million dollars for the identity of the killer. Milliken refuses the offer but gives him the number on someone who might be able to help. Roy Prescott is a former cop who does not play by the rules. He will do whatever is necessary to track this killer and make him pay for his crime. <br />The cat and mouse game is very intense for the first half of the book but afterwards the story begins to flounder. Prescott is relentless with his investigation. He manages to track the killer, taunt him and humiliate him. He treats the killer as a little boy hoping that he will make a mistake that will cause his undoing. When Prescott fails the first time he decides to find out who hired the killer in the first place. It is at this point when the story weakens. At the pace the story was going the reader is not interested in finding out the why of the massacre, they are just interested in Prescott capturing the killer. When the author tries to explain the circumstances of the crime the reader feels cheated. There are no clever surprises or cliffhangers. There is a showdown at the end of the novel but by then all the participants are prepared. They know what to expect and perform what they are supposed to do. Once the character's purpose is fulfilled the author has no more use for them and just lets them die. There isa strong sense of finality in the book that does not leave many options for the surviving characters.	2002-04-23

It was her testimony that fingered DellaVecchio for the crime and sentenced him to life in prison. His attorney, Brenna Kennedy, sets him free after she finds indisputable DNA evidence proving that Carmen could not have committed the crime. Harnett is shocked by the revelation and begins to question everything that she went through.<br />Psychologist Jim Christensen is hired by Teresa to try to find out the truth in her fractured mind. She has not fully recovered from her injuries and is still suffering from partial amnesia. She is not confident with her memories and wonders if it has been tampered. Christensen is not convinced on her recollections and believes that she is hiding what really happened eight years ago. During the sessions Harnett confesses that for the last few days she has received threatening phone calls from someone who is not DellaVecchio but who knows the most intimate details of her rape. She is scared and afraid that she will be attacked again. It is not until she finds her old journals that the truth is slowly revealed. There is a conspiracy that cannot afford for Harnett to remember what is in her confused mind. They will do whatever it takes to make sure the truth never comes out and to silence her permanently. <br />Smith gives his book an interesting approach. Just when you think the story involves one thing it turns out to be something unrelated to the original situation. The twists and turns will keep the reader guessing until it reaches its satisfying conclusion.	2002-04-23

While working on the documentary he meets Ettie Washington, a septuagenarian who lived in that New York City area for most of her life. They get together for several days a week where Pellam records Ettie's memories of life in Hell's Kitchen. One day on his way to see Ettie, John witnesses her building being engulfed by flames. Ettie manages to escape but gets arrested shortly thereafter on suspicion of arson and insurance fraud. The police have strong circumstantial evidence against Ms. Washington and they plan to indict her for the death of one of the building's tenants. Pellam is not convinced of her guilt and he will do everything in his power to prove her innocence.<br />During the course of his investigation he meets several characters that show life in Hell's Kitchen. Carol Wyandotte is a pessimistic social worker that does not have any hope for the youth living in that area. Roger McKennah is a real estate developer who wants to replace the tenements with new buildings. Sonny is a pyromaniac who is burning buildings all over Ettie's neighborhood for some mysterious motive that will be made clear later in the novel. There are other secondary characters that help bring the book to life, everything from Irish gangs to male prostitutes. Everyone has a story to tell and they make sure John hears all about it.<br />Jeffery Deaver (or William Jefferies) gives a bleak portrait of this infamous New York area. There is a sense of hopelessness and despair shown throughout the book. It has an interesting plot and it was just recently nominated for an Edgar Award for Best Paperback Mystery Novel. The author's work had certain twists and turns that surprised me as a reader. I strongly recommend this book but be warned, it is a downer. Hopefully the next book I read will lift my spirits.	2002-04-10

This book is like going back to an old friend and getting once again reacquainted. This is one of Nevada Barr's best novels and I recommend it to anyone discovering Ms. Pigeon for the first time.<br />In Ms. Barr's latest novel, Anna returns to her job as the District Ranger for the Natchez Trace, a gorgeous scenic route that goes from Memphis, Tennessee to Natchez, Mississippi. She encounters the same managerial problems she had with her staff in DEEP SOUTH and encounters another dead person. The body belongs to Doyce Barnette, brother of Raymond Barnette. Raymond is the town mortician as well as the leading candidate for new sheriff. Raymond is more concerned of his political aspirations instead of his brother. He is very secretive and does his best to impede the investigation. Anna has her hands full dealing with poachers, her married boyfriend, as well as someone trying to kill her. <br />I strongly recommend you read DEEP SOUTH before reading her latest work. There are some spoilers in HUNTING SEASON that might spoil the other Natchez Trace Anna Pigeon mystery. They are both good.	2002-04-08

SILENT JOE is his best novel and I am glad that it got the Edgar nomination for Best Novel of the Year.<br />This is the story of Joe Trona, a young man working as a jailer and as a jack-of-all-trades for Will Trona, his adoptive father as well as a local politician. When Joe was a baby his father physically disfigured him by throwing acid on his face. Due to the physical abuse he is separated from his family and put in a group home. Several years later he makes the acquaintance of Will Trona and his wife and is adopted shortly thereafter. Joe is very happy with his life, he has a job he likes, owns his home, and loves his family. Unfortunately at the beginning of the novel, his adoptive father is murdered right in front of him and he is going to do everything in his power to find out whom had his father killed and what was his motive.<br />Mr. Parker does an excellent job in showing Joe's innocence and naivete. This does not make the main character any weaker but stronger. He is always true to himself and will not do anything that it is out of character for him. He is trustworthy and very loyal. In this book there is a lot of supporting characters that help enhance the story line. This book is well written and I hope to see more of it in the future. I hope the author decides to bring Joe Trona back in a new novel or a short story. For someone who did not like Parker's previous work, I am looking forward to his next book.	2002-04-08

I have no complaints about the main characters. I was able to catch up as to who they are and their motivations. The problem was that this book was overly hyped to me and I just could not see what was so great about it.<br />Private Investigators Lydia Chin and Bill Smith are sent to Hong Kong in order to fulfill a bequest made to them by Grandfather Gao. They feel that there is something more to this mission that they are being told and find out that they are right. When they arrive to Hong Kong they are caught in the middle of a kidnapping case where two different groups are claiming responsibility for the actions. It appears that Harry Wei's nanny kidnapped him for reasons only known to her and later to the reader. Lydia and Bill will do everything in their power to rescue Harry even if it involves them getting involved with Chinese Triads, smugglers and tongs.<br />The story focuses on culture shock as Lydia Chin comes to China for the first time after living most of her life in Chinatown. We see the prejudice that Chinese people have on foreigners. This is not something exclusively Chinese but it is something we are seeing almost everyday in the news for other parts of the world. The author's descriptions are very vivid where it is easy for the reader to visualize the scenery. This book has its requisite twist and turns and the book had my attention. I just did not think it was that great. Hopefully I might change my mind in the future after I read some of S. J. Rozan's other works.	2002-04-08

This premise sounds good unfortunately this is not the plot of the novel.<br />This is the story of three people: Rick Beanblossom, a scarred news producer who hides his deformed face behind a mask; Andrea Labore, a reporter from Channel 7 news who wants to become its newest anchorwoman; and Dixon Bell, the local weatherman who lives exclusively for the weather and is never wrong about his forecasts. Their lives intertwine as they work together in the newsroom and in the investigation of a serial killer that is murdering young professional women each time the seasons change. The story is complex and it encompasses several years.<br />Each one of these characters is carefully described and we get to see their strengths as well as their weaknesses. One of them is arrested for the Minnesota killings and another one is trying to prove his innocence. There are no clear-cut answers in this book. The reader does not know if the television weatherman is the killer or just the perfect patsy. This work is a character study more than a murder mystery. It works well with this book however there are times when it can become real tedious. This book lets you use your imagination for the book's resolution. Consider yourself warned if the paperback copy written at the rear leads you to read THE WEATHERMAN. You might be disappointed at the beginning but the plot becomes interesting.	2002-04-08

I will be sorry to see her go but I can understand what the author wants to accomplish. In this latest adventure, Jane is retired from the guide business and just wants to be a happy housewife with her husband, Dr. Carey McKinnon. She is a one-woman witness protection program who knows how to hide people permanently and lead them to work new lives. She is `retired' but just like in the Godfather movies just as she gets out she gets dragged back in. In this case it involves Rita Shelford, a former hotel cleaning lady who is now running from the mob.<br />Bernie \\"The Elephant\\" Lupus has just died. He worked as a mob banker who does not use paper. He relies on his expansive photographic and eidetic memory to remember bank accounts and passwords. The mob is panicky because the only person Bernie ever trusted was Rita and they want to know what she knows and try to get some of their money back. After some false starts, Rita finds Jane and asks for her help. Unfortunately so does Bernie. News of his demise was greatly exaggerated.<br />Jane travels all over the country trying to hide Bernie and Rita. They also came up with the plan to take all of the mob's money and give everything away to charity. Once the mob finds out they will do whatever it takes to protect their interests. There is a lot of suspense and action in this story. You do not have to read previous novels to understand this one but I guarantee that once you read BLOOD MONEY you will try to find her other adventures. Thomas Perry's other novels are just as good and I suggest you give them a shot.	2002-04-08

The characters are realistic and down-to-earth where one can easily identify with them. Sara Linton works as a pediatrician in a small town in Georgia. She is also the town's coroner who is going to have a very busy week. She discovers the mutilated body of Sybil Adams in the local diner and a few days later finds another victim placed in the hood of her car. What makes this case a little more complicated is that her ex-husband, Jeffrey Tolliver, is the town sheriff who is investigating the assaults.<br />One thing that makes this work interesting is the inclusion of Lena Adams, the sister of the first victim. Lena works for the sheriff as a police deputy and she is going to have a hard time with this case. During the last couple of years she has withdrawn from her twin sister and had not talked much to her. It took her death to show how much her sister's death affected her.<br />All of the major characters are hiding either a personal secret or a weakness that helps to enhance the story line. During the week that the case takes place several of the characters will go though some life altering changes which in the end will improve on their lives. The identity of the serial killer is predictable once you get to know who are the characters in the book. BLINDSIGHTED is a good debut for a promising new author and I will be looking forward to her next book.	2002-04-08

The first third of the book is interesting but afterwards it all goes downhill from there. At the beginning of the book we meet Alicia, Havana's best bicycle hooker. She is a professional who has mastered the con and just goes through the paces looking for her next customer. She seduces her victims by riding her bicycle near their cars and when she catches them staring, she moves in for the kill. She has an `accident' and the victim immediately rush to her aid. Alicia takes pride in her work and she has her routine down pat and we get to learn how she works. We see how she prepares for every scenario, how her mother helps her daughter, and how she always refuses taking money from her clients. \\"What kind of girl do you think I am,\\" she tells her escorts. She knows of better ways to get paid and we see it throughout the book. Alicia is happy with her life and she hopes one day to make the big score when she lands a rich man. Her life (and the reader's) changes once she meets Tom King. This is when the story begins to fail.<br />Mr. King is a con man who is trying to get Dutch interests to give him money to excavate Cuba's oceans. When things are going well for him he finds Alicia. Apparently he has studied Alicia before and he knows what she is all about. He lets her become the latest victim and he gets to see up close and personal how she works. He later offers her a deal, which she accepts, and it will help her do more for her craft and earn more money. It is not until Mr. King's employer dies that the comedy of errors begins. Alicia goes way over her head and participates in a fake kidnapping to disguise an accidental death. Chavarria spoils what he created with Alicia's character and it spoils the story. It was like reading a cross between THE CRYING GAME and WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S. Everything is resolved at the end and the status quo is brought back at a high cost. It was a promising start that just went astray.	2002-04-08

Melina and Gillian Lloyd are identical twin sisters who decide on a lark to switch places for one night. Melina is supposed to escort former astronaut Chief Hart to a special dinner honoring him. One of the sisters escorts him and they have a wonderful time, however, when the night is over one of the twins is brutally murdered.<br />Ms. Brown insults the reader by lying throughout the book when it does not even enhance the plot. One does not know if the twin is the right twin or if the twin is the twin pretending to be the twin pretending to be the twin. See how confusing this gets? If the author was honest with her readers or at least make the main character a bit ambiguous then the novel might be enjoyable.  Unfortunately, the author lies about the main character's identity that at the time it is actually revealed one does not even care. The characters are flat and caricatures of what they are supposed to be. There is a second story within the novel involving a cult who are kidnapping children born out of artificially inseminated mothers. The story is a bit ludicrous as well as disappointing.<br />	2002-03-25

One day one of the prisoners is brutally killed by persons unknown. The accused is Lincoln Scott, a Tuskegee airman, who was a victim to the murdered man's taunts. Hart is given the duty of defending Scott in a military tribunal held inside the prison. This case is going to be very important to Hart since it is going to affect everyone involved at the camp.<br />Katzenbach does an excellent job with characterizations. You get to know every prisoner involved and get to know a little about his life story. The courtroom drama was well executed and I liked the way everything turns out at the end. You can appreciate how hard Katzenbach researched his material for this novel. He made the P.O.W. camps interesting and I got to learn a lot about the Tuskegee airmen. These were African-American pilots who were trained to fly and protect bombers. These men did not get the credit they deserved and they got a bum rap. I am glad that know they are being honored and getting the recognition they so rightfully deserve. This book should be considered one of Katzenbach's best novels. I hope he writes more historical thrillers in the future.	2002-03-25

I regret having read them in disorder but I recommend this novel for anyone interested in learning how V. I. got started. Although this is the third novel in the series it tells a lot.	2002-03-22

They all have rules and regulations that at first might seem logical but then they border at the inane and ridiculous turning this into a horror novel. It shows what may happen with people who become power hungry and how rules that are meant to control can also destroy. The Welches do their best to fit in the neighborhood but then discover that they might be trapped there forever if they do not do something. The Bonita Vista Association have severe penalties for housing infractions.<br />I enjoyed this novel even thought there are several graphic scenes involved. This book is not for the squeamish. If you like this novel, I strongly recommend his previous novel THE STORE. It also has an extreme message but it is something small business owners can identify with.	2002-03-20

I applaud Mr. Bernhardt for all the charity work he has done in the last few years by editing projects like LEGAL BRIEFS and NATURAL SUSPECT whose proceeds go to charity. I am sorry that this novel in his JUSTICE series does not have my praise.<br />Ben Kincaid is lured from his private practice to work for the Apollo Consortium. He is supposed to be very smart but no matter how smart he cannot see that he is being set up to take a fall. Second, he finds a 'dead' body in his office, leaves for five minutes and then the body disappears. I will not spoil it for those who have not read this book but farfetched does not even cover it. The dead body was a member of something called 'The Kindergarten Club' which is related to a rash of murders ocuring in Kincaid's town of Tulsa, Oklahoma.<br />At the end of the novel, just like Jessica Fletcher, he solves every piece of the puzzle and yet he took his time in finding out that he was being treated like a fool at his new firm. Thank goodness this was not a permanent predicament. I hope that there are better JUSTICE novels in his series.	2002-03-19

She has been working on the network for several years making obituary segments of newsmakers before they die. This helps them to be prepared at a moment's notice and not to have scrounge for material when the newsmaker officially passes away. Laura wants to move ahead and work as a producer for KEY second highest-rated news magazine, Hourglass.  In the story there is a murder mystery as well as a subplot involving a dead pool in which the person who predicts which celebrity will die next will win a lot of money. <br />The story is a bit forced there is no smooth transition from one scene to another. The author tries to hard in creating red herrings as well as planting clues. One things that the deaths in the book is about one thing when in reality is about another. She wants the reader to be suspicious of everyone and being a bit obvious about it. This book will not deter me in trying her other novels (this one is my first), however, Ms. Clark should let the story take its course and not spoil it with unnecessary details.	2002-03-18

She quits her job in Houston and becomes a legend in the bounty hunter field. Most suspects who jump bail do not want to be caught by her. She is relentless and does not give up easily.<br />In the first book of the series, Flannigan is hired to find Parker Dann who is accused of killing a little girl in a hit-and-run accident. Dan has no recollection of the events and he feels that he is being railroaded so he flees. Flannigan finds him hiding in North Dakota and brings him in during one of the worst blizzards in history. As she apprehends the bail jumper she is not convinced of his guilt. She takes a chance to investigate and what she finds will give chills on one's spine.<br />Dixie is very entertaining in a serious sort of way. She loves her family even though sometimes they get on her nerves. My main problem with this book was that it involves the killing of two sisters. It is not gruesome but it is not something I would enjoy reading from a first-time author. The book makes good use of its humor without it being slapstick. Ms. Rogers also makes good use of the supporting characters such as Brew, Hooch, and Ski. I will probably read RAGE FACTOR and CHILL FACTOR in the future.	2002-03-18

She fought the attacker and escaped from the clutches of `The Boogeyman'. Twenty years later, she is working as a police officer who is always looking behind her shoulder waiting for `The Boogeyman' to assault her again. This is the synopsis we get at the back of the book, however the story is completely different.<br />An ex-husband wants vengeance against the woman who divorced him. As he begins to plan he learns that his ex-wife is being targeted by a serial killer and decides to use this to his advantage. He studies the killer's methods and tries to emulate them when it comes time to kill her and therefore commit the perfect crime. The police will concentrate on the serial killer and ignore the ex-husband who already has an alibi. As it is with most of these novels it does not turn out that way thanks to the quick thinking of Officer Osborn and the police.<br />The serial killer story is what takes center stage in this book. `The Boogeyman' is only important at the beginning and at the end. The plot of the story takes place in twenty-six hours that does not give enough time for character development. Mr. Prescott should have done the serial killer story exclusively, that story was good. C. J.'s boogeyman turned out to be something flat and I think he could have done something better had he written this novel knowing that there would be a sequel. Fans will be disappointed on the way things turned out in this book.	2002-03-18

Brazil wants to use his journalism skills in order to help the police department and with the blessing of his boss, Judy Hammer he creates the Trooper Truth web site. He uses this forum to talk about Virginia history and to talk about law enforcement. All it does is create more trouble than this book is worth.<br />The governor of Virginia is putting stringent laws to the island of Tangier in the coast of the state. The people from Tangier want to become independent of the state. A lot of confusion is created in this book for its characters as well as the readers. There is a lot of play of words, a comedy of errors and some slapstick humor.<br />This book is meant to be a satire but I think it fails miserably. There were very few scenes that were funny. There is also a cameo appearance by Kay Scarpetta, which seems to be a token for the faithful reader. I do not know what else to say since I do not have any constructive suggestions for this book I just hope to enjoy Ms. Cornwell's next novel and forget about this one.	2002-03-18

On the last day at his job, two co-workers are found dead in their office in what appears to be a murder-suicide. The new district attorney is not convinced and decides to investigate. He arrests Joel Friedman, an associate at the law firm, who was last seen arguing the day before with one of the deceased. Daley decides to help his friend since he believes that there is more to this case than meets the eye and he is right.<br />This is a good debut for a promising new author; the book has its twists and turns but nothing that I would consider to be predictable. The law firm is full of suspects and they have lots of secrets to hide. It is when the reader passes through each level in the case the author appreciates the novel more. There is a lot of character development and it is an intriguing case. The novel is slightly long but it was not a turn-off. This book is for fans of the courtroom drama, it goes to every aspect of the trial from opening statements all the way to the verdict. I found the ending to be good, a bit unexpected but entertaining. I am looking forward to read INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE in the future.	2002-03-18

John Rebus is a complex character who is battling his own personal demons. He is an Edinburgh Detective Inspector who is a recovering alcoholic and who is trying to reconnect with his daughter, Sammy, after many years of separation.<br />In this novel, Sammy is a victim of a hit-and-run and is currently unconscious in the hospital; a gang war is brewing and seems that the Yakuza might be involved; and an elderly man is being investigated as a Nazi war criminal. Rebus is trying to save Karina, a Bosnian refugee who is working as a prostitute in the streets of Edinburgh. Rankin does an excellent job with characterization giving depth to all the supporting players involved in the story. He focuses on their strengths as well as their weaknesses and does a great job in showing irony on several occasions.<br />The author knows how to structure the story. He makes use of flashbacks without warning the readers. It helps one to appreciate the then as well as the now. The story is not linear and it helps one to understand the motivation of most of the characters. I enjoyed my first John Rebus novel and I hope that all the others are as good as this one.	2002-03-10

Ray does not know what to think about the money and he is afraid that his respected father was a crook.<br />My last foray with Grisham was with THE BRETHREN. I thought it was one of the worst novels I ever read. This novel is slightly better but it still falters. The story goes through several unrelated threads that do not fit right. Ray thinks that the judge won his money gambling and the reader spends too long reading about it and not getting anywhere. We find very late in the game where the money came from but by then the reader does not really care. Any Grisham addict will read this book but this is not his best work. I consider THE TESTAMENT to be his latest good novel.	2002-03-05

She is a whistleblower who broke a fraud scheme within her former company but later was hired by the GAO to work as a regulator. It is in her position within the agency that she starts to uncover a conspiracy involving the Chinese government.<br />The story does not end properly with this novel. It seem the story will continue in Shelby's next novel. This might disappoint some people, others might not care. My main problem with the novel was that I thought the conspiracy and the assasination attempt came up a bit too easily. Once they find some evidence, something happens to nullify it.<br />Ms. Ryder saves the day several times and as a civilian she makes law enforcement seem inept. She finds the clues quicker than the police and she does a better job of defending herself than the Secret Service. She gets to see the face of the Handyman up close and personal. Now there are two women who know who he is (the first being GATEKEEPER's Hollis Freemont, who has a short and unsatisfying role in the novel) they will probably team up and try to bring him down in the future.

One, all the proceeds from this book goes to help breast cancer charities; second, except for two of the authors, I had read previous works from the participants and have enjoyed every one. Each author contributes a chapter and then passes it to another author to continue the story. They all did a great job and made it interesting to see how they reacted to some outrageous plot threads put in the story. The story is definitely farfetched but it was fun. I applaud Laurie King for writing a decent final chapter to the mess provided by the other authors. All threads were tied and everybody could breath a sound of relief. I am not claiming this to be great literature but I thought the concept was a good idea and it all goes to a worthy cause.	2002-03-01

She is also having doubts with her affair since meeting Ned's wife, who through unforeseen circumstances and coincidence winds up being Francie's tennis partner in an important tournament. Roger finds Francie's love nest and he has decided that he wants her dead but just like any other criminal, he does not want to get caught.<br />After doing some thorough research he decides to manipulate Whitey Truax into committing a crime in which his wife will turn out dead. Just like any other book things do not turn up as planned and all of Roger's scheming have gone done the tubes into a predictable conclusion. Roger thinks he is too smart and that he has planned for every eventuality and this book shows that is not entirely true.<br />In reading this novel I was expecting a story similar to A SIMPLE PLAN by Scott Smith. This story has too many coincidences that tempted me to stop reading the book.  This is my first Peter Abrahams novel and I will try to read him again in the future. He does a good job with characterization but to me the plot fizzled. There were some loose ends that were not clarified and there were at least two characters in the book that I found to be redundant to the storyline. I do not think removing them would have made any difference but that is just how I feel.	2002-03-01

Lawyer Judy Carrier is tired of working with torts and contracts that she wants to try something new. Pigeon Tony is a friend of someone very close to Judy that she is willing to work pro bono for him. Pigeon Tony admits to killing Carluzzi but not of murdering him. He was working on a sixty-year-old vendetta against Carluzzi whom he blames for killing his wife and daughter.<br />The story relies too much on flashback and after a while you get tired of reading about it. There is also a family feud between the Lucias and the Carluzzis that make the Hatfields and McCoys seem tame in comparison. It is fairly obvious what the outcome of the trial will be. There is some humor in the novel, which did not do much for me. The only other novel I read by Scottoline was MISTAKEN IDENTITY. I thought this was a better novel and I strongly recommend it. I also suggest LEGAL BRIEFS, a mystery anthology. It has a Lisa Scottoline short story that I just found hysterical. I might not like this novel but I still like her work.	2002-03-01
US	53045954	RM6EGQ3N5CDN3	0446610178	794635347	The Sky Is Falling	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Predictable	Dana Evans is a television anchorwoman who is investigating the killing of Gary Winthrop, the last surviving member of the Winthrop clan. This family was considered America's royal family. Unfortunately, all five members died in tragic accidents within the last year. Dana thinks that all of this is too coincidental and she uses her resources to learn the truth.<br />Mr. Sheldon does a good job creating several character dynamics with Dana by including Kemal. Kemal is an eleven-year-old she rescued from Sarajevo who lost his arm during the war. Kemal is afraid that Dana is going to reject him and send him back; Dana is afraid that she is doing a bad job as a mother to Kemal and is afraid that Children Services is going to whisk him away. This is the only good subplot in the novel; everything else in the story was superfluous. Nobody is willing to talk bad about the Winthrops and those who do wind up dead... The motives came out of left field making something complicated out of something simple. It made me feel that the more complicated the story line, the more plausible it can be. This book is a quick read. I have read two other novels by this author and none of them have really satisfied me. The book is only good if you need time to kill.	2002-03-01

I am sure I would have appreciated this novel better had I read previous 87th precinct novels. This is the first time I meet the characters from the squad and there were some chapters I had to reread in order to understand what was going on, particularly the death of Steve Carella's father.<br />The case begins with a gruesome discovery at the town zoo's lion cage. Five lions are having Cassandra Ridley for breakfast. Most of the zoo's territory falls on the 87th precinct; however, the victim's leg winds up reaching the 88th precinct where Fat Ollie Weeks works for the police department.<br />In the course of the investigation they learn that Ms. Ridley was working a pilot for Mexican drug runners. Inadvertently, she was also involved with counterfeit money, which brings the Secret Service to the mix. There is also a death involving a book salesman who also plays a part in this caper.<br />I cannot be too critical about this novel since this is my first McBain novel out of over fifty. I think I would have preferred to learn more of the series regulars before having started this novel. I do not intend to give up with this author since I am sure he has other good novels.	2002-02-20
US	53045954	RNQFYK6EL5G17	0446527378	607227823	The Judgment	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Well-deserved Edgar nomination	In the first paragraph of D. W. Buffa&#8217;s novel, defense attorney Joseph Antonelli states that he hated Judge Calvin Jeffries. He considered him to be one of the most evil men he has ever met. The only reason he is attending the funeral of this murdered judge was because people was seeing this as an affront to the American judicial system.<br />A homeless suspect is arrested and later commits suicide in his cell. Case closed. Three months later a second judge is killed in a similar way and circumstance. Everybody thinks that this is a copycat killer but Antonelli is not convinced. He has his own suspicion as to what really happened and he intends to use it as a defense for his client.<br />Buffa does an excellent job with character development. One gets to know Joseph so well that we can&#8217;t help but root for him. Elliot Winston also plays a role in this novel. He is a former law associate of Antonelli who &#8216;wronged&#8217; Judge Jeffries and is now serving time in a mental institution. Finally, there is the character of Judge Jeffries. He is already dead by the first page but one can&#8217;t help but feel revulsion toward this man. Jeffries was a self-serving megalomaniac who loved to ruin people&#8217;s lives.<br />The novel is a story about revenge. How it was done, why it was done, and who had it done. It will give you chills down your spine once you learn the truth. I was a little sad at the ending but I can understand the circumstances in Buffa's writing as to why he did what he did. It is one of the best mystery novels I have read in a while and I am glad it received an Edgar Award nomination for best novel.	2002-02-19

It has been eight years since the death of Dr. David Beck's wife, Elizabeth. He is still grieving after all this time and has not moved forward in his life. On the day of a very special anniversary he receives an anonymous e-mail. In it he gets a hyperlink that takes him to a web cam in an anonymous city. He is shocked when he sees his `dead' wife on the screen.<br />He is now searching for the truth about what happened eight years ago. A serial killer now serving time in Death Row allegedly murdered his wife. There is a group of people who do not want him to learn the truth so they try to frame him for murder and try to find out what he knows.<br />The novel has a lot of action and it is very intense, however, the ending seemed to be a little bit abrupt after all that has happened. The other problem I had with this particular book was that it reminded me of Greg Iles' latest novel, DEAD SLEEP. The stories parallel one another and one just needs to make several substitutions to get the same plot. This book is hard to read in several days, one has to read it constantly in order to find out what happens next. I liked it but I was prejudiced after having read Iles' novel.	2002-02-19

Burke is an ex-con who escaped from New York and is now trying to live a life in Portland, Oregon as B. B. Hazard. He is hired to find a missing girl who left her family's home without a trace. While performing his investigation he learns about the darkness this new city offers. The girl's father seems a bit too overeager in finding his daughter. One is ready to think the worst of somebody and one finds that he is but for the wrong reason. The book's resolution was a surprise to me. <br />This novel is very hard-boiled and not for the kids. It took me a while to get to grasp the meaning of this book since it is something I am not used to read. Vachss knows his material as stated in his biography. He shows the dark side of humanity and it is not always pretty. This was my first Burke novel. I might try to read FLOOD in the future in order to gain a better understanding of this character.	2002-02-17

Most of her clients feel that there is something fishy going around in the company since they were doing the job of two or more people. Liza's other concern is that her husband has disappeared for over a year and he is always on her mind. She starts her investigation and is shocked what she discovers.<br />The author overwhelms the reader with too much information. We always have to know what Liza is thinking and why she is thinking it. She also puts a lot of suspects on the plate so that one goes, \\"he did it\\", \\"no he did it\\", \\"no she did it\\". Every time she gets close to the truth, somebody dies, gets mugged, or their houses broken into. She wants to make Liza a strong character but after a while I just found her pathetic and I just finished the book. I was slightly surprised with the ending but that was it.<br />There were two main things that really bothered me with the novel. The first is that there is a big, loose thread involving the guilty person's son and I would have liked to see that resolved. The second thing was that there is a scene where Liza finds a doll filled with fifty thousand dollars in thousand dollar bills. The largest denomination of dollar bill available in the United States is the hundred-dollar bill. The thousand and five hundred dollar bill have been discontinued for almost twenty years. One can say that this story could take place during the sixties or seventies, but with all the musical references added to the book plus the use of the Internet it is highly unlikely. This novel was poorly written and the fact checking was just nil. Ms. Anders might be a popular author but not with this novel.	2002-02-17

His books are enjoyable to read without becoming a cozy. I have read several short stories with John Francis Cuddy and I also read one of her previous novels. I enjoy his stories but I cannot say that they are memorable. <br />Cuddy's latest case involves the death of Woodrow Wilson Gant, a prominent African American divorce attorney, who gets gun downed from his car. His passenger is the mysterious blonde woman, who was drunk and oblivious to what happened. Once she wakes up and sees what happened she flees leaving the reader curious as to her identity. The accused turns out to be a racist bigot by the name of Alan Spaeth who threatened the lawyer after a messy divorce. Cuddy may not like the guy but he finds too many coincidences that prove that Spaeth is innocent.<br />There are too many characters involved in this novel. Everybody has a story. Some of their stories were touching and others were funny. Someone suggested to me that it almost seemed that Cuddy was trying to become Columbo visiting suspects continually until the truth is revealed. At the beginning of the novel, Gant's killer said three words to his victim before he died. If one is attentive to the book one can easily find out whom the murderer is. The mysterious woman with the blonde wig was a different story. There were several red herring candidates but at least when her identity was revealed it was not something out of left field. This just a comfortable read and I plan on reading some of his other novels in the near future.	2002-02-14

She is working for a contractor who is being pressure by the bank to pay off his loan because the bank suspects him to be involved in a fraud. He has made his payments on time and has not had any previous problem with the law, however when he does his own investigation he notices that the conservatories (greenhouses) he has put up have just vanished. <br />Kate's friend, Alexis, also has a problem. She has been conned out of 5,000 pounds from a real estate scheme and she wants Kate's help. What makes this a bit unique is that the two cases are somewhat related to each other as the story moves along. The story is full of twists and turns and a lot of action. I am sorry this was a quick read but I just love her work.<br />Kate is a firecracker. She is ready to go at bat for her friends and does not like to leave any stone unturned. She is resourceful and she knows how to kick butt when the time comes. If you want to get on her good side, you do not serve her substandard Chinese food. You might regret it.<br />McDermid knows how to tell a good story and it is great to know that her earlier novels are just as good as her most recent work. I highly recommend A PLACE OF EXECUTION if you still have not read it. It is her best book up to now bar none.	2002-02-11

Before he dies he wants to make sure that all his affairs are in order. His biggest regret was losing the love of his life, Lily Talbot. Eight years ago, Furlong received a picture that showed Lily and another man in an uncompromising position. Feeling betrayed, Jay broke off his relationship Lily without giving her a chance to explain. Furlong recently discovered that the picture was a fake and that this lie has caused him the love of his life. He hires Amos Walker, a Detroit Private Investigator, to find out who was the instigator that wrecked his chance at happiness.<br />Amos Walker is a riot. He does not take guff from anyone and he has a quick mind that helps him with his detective job as well as coming up with great one-liners. Estleman explores most of the aspects in the life of Jay Bell Furlong. He introduces several of his relatives and acquaintances and shows how he affected each of their lives. He does not make Furlong to be a saint but he does a great job in developing him as a character.<br />The plot is well done and I did not feel lost at any point in this book. I have read some of Estleman's short stories and none of them have been very memorable to me, however I digress with his character of Amos Walker. This is the first Amos Walker novel I read and it will not be my last. One reason I consider him a winner was that I was able to understand the character without having read any of his previous adventures. I have read some novels that take readers for granted and assumes one knows everything about their main series character. This particular author does not do that and for that I am grateful.	2002-02-09

Since then I have read at least one novel from two of her series characters, Kate Brannigan, a private investigator and Lindsay Gordon, a former journalist. KILLING THE SHADOWS is a stand-alone mystery and fairly entertaining.<br />The main character in her novel is Fiona Cameron, a college professor who used to work in conjunction with the police by doing geographic profiling of crimes. She quit working with the police after they ignored her advice and used another expert. The other professional hired entrapped a sexual homicide suspect and caused that all the evidence against the accused be thrown out of court. <br />A self-righteous serial murderer is killing several crime novelists. He takes heinous scenes from their works and tries to imitate as close to the novel as he can. Fiona gets involved in the case because her boyfriend is a world-famous thriller author and she fears he might be targeted. Cameron also feels a sense of personal responsibility due to several aspects in her past that are revealed earlier in the book. There are two subplots involved in this novels that help enhance the character personalities in this book. One involves a sexual homicide that occurs early in the book and a serial killer who is terrorizing tourist in Toledo, Spain<br />One factor in McDermid&#8217;s book that I enjoyed was the inclusion of excerpts of the victim&#8217;s work before they were executed. I also learned something I did not know about Agatha Christie.<br />The killer&#8217;s motivation for the authors&#8217; murders was unconvincing, but I did not particularly care. Val McDermid is one of the best authors I have experienced in a long time. I intend to continue to read her novels as her books become more readily available.	2002-02-08

They are involved in a case involving kidnapping and stolen stamps. This case will affect Brock because aspects of his past are going to be involved in this affair. <br />There are times in the story when the plot gets to be a bit confusing. The author takes a lot of time bringing out all the players involved. It is not till the end of the novel that we see how one person was manipulating most of the characters. It is not clear exactly one happens but the author puts his effort. We get to see the characters as they are as well as how they pretend to be in other people's company. We get to learn a little bit of Brock's past and we get to see a bit more of Kolla's character. <br />I preferred Maitland's previous novels to this one. The story here is good but I think THE MALCONTENTA was better. I am looking forward to reading SILVERMEADOW as soon as it becomes available in the United States.	2002-02-06

Inspector Banks is sent to investigate a beating death outside of the English pub areas. Everything seems cut and dried at first since the victim was a renowned racist who was seen arguing with a group of Pakistani youths. If it were that simple there would not be a novel.<br />The book focuses on hatred and drug dealing. Inspector Banks is having major personal problems that at times might hinder his investigation. This is my second Inspector Banks novel (PAST REASON HATED being first). I intend to continue reading the series because I have heard many positive things about the character in other novels. This book was good but not as good as the one I previously read.	2002-02-05

Elvis does his best to investigate at the risk of losing his P. I. license, his life and his girlfriend.

She is hired by a newspaper to find out who hacked into their computers and filed a story that was not meant to be published. It involves the checkered past of Wink Wynkowski, a basketball promoter, who is trying to lure a professional team to move to Baltimore. Shortly after the article is printed, Wink is found dead of an apparent suicide. She does her best in trying to find answers to this death as well to other related ones that occur later on in the novel. She will be surprised to what she discovers.<br />Tess is also investigating an assault case on her uncle. He leaves her a greyhound that everybody is looking for. The Greyhound storyline was a bit disturbing. We learn about illegal dog racing as well as other activities that would shock just about anybody. I do not wish to spoil it for anyone but it was very troubling. <br />The author piques ones interest in learning about the problem some of these greyhounds have after leaving the track and later being adopted by a loving family. Ms. Lippmans love for dogs is evident in these pages.<br />I liked reading about Tess and plan to do so in the future, however, I plan on reading her first novel, BALTIMORE BLUES before going any further.

I take this book to be a prologue for the miniseries and I hope to enjoy the program. It is irrelevant to me who &#8216;really&#8217; wrote the diary since the idea of the book is to explore the mind of one of the haunted house&#8217;s owners.<br />In 1907, Ellen a naïve, young woman marries John Rimbaud, an oil tycoon. She decides to keep a diary to explain the feelings she shares for her husband and her new life. We discover that he is a cruel man who likes having affair with other woman. He does not care for other peoples&#8217; feelings and does whatever he wants. He wants to show how powerful he is by having the biggest and most elaborate house that will later become Rose Red. He is aware that he is desecrating an Indian burial site but he just doesn&#8217;t care. Even when weird things start happening he becomes indifferent. Only when it directly affects him is when he starts to worry.<br />Ellen explores in her diary several things including her hidden sexuality, the dark arts, her plotting for revenge, and her rapport with the house. For reasons that are later explained in the diary, men are getting killed and women disappear in the ever-expanding house.<br />Overall, I think the writing was good. I had a problem with some of the words used that I do not think were used during the 1910s and 1920s. I am not a lexicographer but maybe I am just mistaken. It is an interesting story told but just like in any other diary it is completely one-sided. It would have been interesting if Dr. Reardon had unearthed some addendum material to include in the book to support or deny Ellen&#8217;s writings.	2002-01-27

Her commanding officer gives her and her partner instructions to go investigate an alleged suicide at a posh health spa. When Kathy starts to investigate she finds inconsistencies with the suicide finding and suffers from obstructions of justice brought by the staff of the spa. When Kathy starts creating waves she is yanked off the case by her commanding officer.<br />Kathy decides to visit Brock. Since their work together in the previous novel they share a mutual respect for each other. Kathy tells Brock about the case and her concerns and he decides to join the spa in order to find information.<br />Kathy grows in this novel after the foolhardy way she worked her previous case. I like that the author is taking his time in exploring her characters as he did with DS Kolla this time. He describes her home as well as her neighbors and introduces a possible love interest for Kathy. Brock is still mysterious and in every book we get to know a little more about him but not much about his personal life.<br />The supporting characters are rather diverse but very interesting. Everybody seemed to hate the dead victim and everyone had an opportunity to kill him in one way or another. It is interesting in this book how one person can affect a whole group of people in ways that affect them indirectly. The story is very involving till the very end.<br />My only complaint in this book was Kathy herself. There were several characters that were hindering her investigation that she should have arrested for obstruction. Maybe the English have a different way of doing things than the Americans or perhaps the author thought it would have served no purpose. No matter, I enjoyed this novel and am lookingforward to reading THE CHALON HEADS.	2002-01-26

He believes that this will outrage the American public and that it will make it easier for him to run for President and to replace the CIA director with someone he can trust and manipulate. In the end he fails and cuts his losses to fight another day by having his co-conspirators killed.<br />In SEPARATION OF POWER, three weeks have passed. Thomas Stansfield, the Director of the CIA, has died of cancer. His hand-picked successor is Dr. Irene Kennedy. Mitch Rapp, a covert-op, is still trying to find out who set him up in the last novel. He knows the identity of the assassin hired by the senator who killed Mitch's only link. The story gets into it when the assassin is slated for termination in order to silence her.<br />The story takes a lot of twist and turns with its action and intensity. When things start going real bad, a rabbit is pulled out of the hat. I enjoyed this novel and was glad to see that the bad guy finally gets his comeuppance in a well-deserved manner. I am glad that Flynn spread this story line into two novels because it the story flows better instead of feeling cramped. Flynn's first two novels have some of the players involved in his latest work, but it is not essential to read in order to enjoy the novel. I strongly recommend one read THE THIRD OPTION before reading SEPARATION OF POWER. You might be disappointed the way the previous novel ends but this latest one really makes up for it. I am looking forward to Vince Flynn's next novel and I hope he creates a new story arc for his political thrillers.	2002-01-22

I had trouble knowing who Cole was in the earlier book but after reading this one things starting falling into place.<br />Elvis Cole is an L.A. Private Investigator who collects Jiminy Cricket as well as other Disney memorabilia. He is hired by Ellen Lang to find her husband and child. He learns that Ellen Lang's husband is dead and that a drug lord has kidnapped her son. The criminal will give the son back to his mother as soon as he gets back the cocaine that Mort allegedly stole from him, Another problem that Elvis faces is that Ellen has disappeared.<br />What follows is a lot of shooting and fighting in the search of Ellen's son. I was not convinced by Crais' characterization of Ellen. She has a lot of emotional problems and low self-esteem that after a few days with Joe Pike (Cole's partner), she is a stronger woman. Cole is [cynical] who likes to live for the moment and finds the humor in anything. Pike is just Pike. He is the strong and silent type who is ready to go into action into a pinch without hesitation. Who cares about the consequences?<br />The Elvis Cole novels seem to be a good series to start when one wants to give their logic circuits a break.	2002-01-21

There are several mishaps and comedy of errors that force Dortmunder and his gang to steal the emerald several times. <br />This is my second Westlake novel; the first being THE HOOK. I was not won over by Dortmunder in this novel; one reason could be that I was thinking of OCEAN'S ELEVEN while reading this book. I might try to read another Dortmunder story in the future but I just could not get into this one. I am aware that the book is a comedy but I did not find it funny.	2002-01-20

In this case, there is an extensive Internal Affairs investigation to bring Scully down. Shane's hand is forced and he investigates his former partner. He uncovers a conspiracy in the LAPD as well as the mayor's office.<br />If you do not try to look for logic in the story you might enjoy it.

He recently divorced his second wife and is now trying to put his life back in order. He joins a men's group and lies to the group telling them that he is a private investigator. Shortly thereafter he is hired as one and someone from the group asks him to track his wife whom he suspects of cheating. Seems easy enough until Turner's client is found dead. Sam knows it could not have been the wife since he has been tracking her all day. It is not until he investigates the case a bit further and finds out that his client was a victim of a serial killer.<br />This book appears to be the beginning of a new series. The main character is trying to get back on his feet and he is helping everyone he can. He turns from a nobody into a somebody in a short time. He now runs a detective agency with the help of acquaintances he has made along the way. They help him as well as each other. Most of the supporting characters are looking for a meaning to their lives and Sam helps to provide it. POET IN THE GUTTER is an excellent start for a promising new author.	2002-01-19

Detective Constable Ben Cooper is assigned to the case where it seems that the girl's parents are indifferent to their missing daughter. The townspeople are not much help, particularly Harry Dickinson who finds Laura's shoe and then her body.<br />Cooper is trying hard to fight his father's ghost, a cop killed on duty, as well as other personal demons. He is teamed-up with Detective Constable Diane Fry, a newcomer to Cooper's police precinct. She is ambitious, headstrong and manages to take the case away from Cooper. They are opposites in personality and there are moments of friction between them in deciding how to investigate the case. <br />It is a good start to what seems to be a promising new series. I would like to see a deeper exploration of Cooper's jealousy toward Fry. The ending in the book seemed a little forced. The guilty are charged and sent to jail but it almost seems like an afterthought. There is a theme of friendship and loyalty between two of the townspeople but I did not feel it while reading the novel. The book mostly explores the personalities of Cooper and Fry as well as the alienation they both feel with their lives. On another side, Laura Vernon's parents have a lot of secrets and it does not help that the townspeople do not like these newcomers in their village.<br />I liked this book and I am looking forward to reading DANCING WITH THE VIRGINS, Booth's next novel.	2002-01-16

She is surprised when she is teamed up with David Brock, a hotshot from Scotland Yard, who has been in the news lately for solving notorious cases. The author throws a few red herrings in the plot but in the end everything turns out right with the world.<br />I appreciate that the author split the book in two parts. In Part One, Maitland teams up Kolla and Brock in the first book of his series. He comes up with a reason to team them up and investigate the crime. It is not until Part Two that we learn the real reason that Brock wanted to meet Kolla. Kathy is not happy at first, but later understands the reasoning.<br />I liked the characters on this novel and am planning on trying to read the other three books in the series. The characters are fresh as well as human. Kolla is having an affair with a married man and she does not like it. There is still more to be learned about Brock.

When I finished reading the book I had to take a breather to take in everything that happened in this story. It is thought provoking and disturbing. <br />It is December 1963. George Bennett, a newly promoted inspector, is sent to Scardale, a small hamlet in England, to investigate the disappearance of 13-year-old Alison Carter. Since this is Inspector Bennett's first case, he hunts high and low trying to find the whereabouts of the missing teenager. Everybody in town is very protective and they do not make the investigation easy for the police. They do not volunteer any information and one gets the feeling that everybody in town knows something that we do not. After a week's investigation, the police find evidence that suggests that Alison was raped and murdered. <br />Shortly thereafter, an arrest is made. The suspect is convicted and punished even though he claims to be innocent. Alison's body was never found but they still managed to find the suspect guilty. This could easily have been the end of the book but it is only the first three-quarters of the novel.<br />In the last quarter of the book thirty-five years have already passed. Catherine Heathcote, a journalist, manages to get George Bennett, now retired, to participate in a true crime book about the murder of Alison Carter. He agrees and collaborates in the writing of the book. It is not until the last possible moment that Bennett asks Heathcote not to publish the book. During a recent visit to Scardale he uncovered some new evidence that brings a whole lot of questions regarding the crime. He refuses to say anything more regarding the case.<br />Heathcote, not easily swayed, investigates. Her discovery has serious repercussions to a lot of people involved in McDermid's work. This is what make the book great and why I put it in my highly recommended list.	2002-01-11

In NEEDFUL THINGS, Stephen King decided to end an era by making this book the last of the Castle Rock series. In the last decade of so, he has focused on a new series called The Dark Tower. Most of his latest novels have had some sort of crossover with the Dark Tower (HEARTS IN ATLANTIS, which is available in paperback). His latest novel is BLACK HOUSE that is a collaboration with Peter Straub. Mr. King let it know that some Dark Tower questions would be revealed in that book so I decided to reread The Dark Tower again by starting with THE GUNSLINGER.<br />This novel tells the story of the last of the gunslingers, a group of warriors similar to the Jedi knights in Star Wars. He is a man with a mission and it is the search of the elusive Man in Black. This story is similar to the errant knights stories (i.e. Don Quixote, El Cid, among others) from centuries ago. Our hero will walk in search of the Man in Black, going through old towns seeking help and will also meet Jake, a boy from the planet Earth. This is the beginning of the series and just like any beginning the reader will be left with questions. The main problem that I had was that I read this book about 15 years ago and I forgot a lot of details. I might try to read the series again before I tackle BLACK HOUSE. It might help me appreciate the novel even better.	2002-01-08

In Denise Mina's latest novel she recaps the sequences of her previous novel and reveals who the killer was in that book. Some questions that I had from GARNETHILL were explained here.<br />In this latest work, Maureen is working for a woman's shelter and trying to gain control of her life. She investigates the death of Ann Harris, a former client from the Scottish center, who was found beaten to death in London. As in most mystery books, things are not quite what they seem and Maureen is way over her head.<br />I enjoyed this book, learning a bit about domestic abuse and women's shelters. Mina has a way with words while describing characters and locations. I only suggest to anyone who is unfamiliar with Mina's work to start with GARNETHILL before beginning EXILE. You will feel richer for it.	2002-01-07

Westlake includes a lot of new authors who have not yet published their first novel. I had trouble following some of the stories after reaching their conclusion (GHOSTS by David Beaty), but others show real promise for the future.<br />One of my favorite stories is MOTEL 66 by Barbara D'Amato. It is a fairly short story that packs a lot of suspense and intrigue. The story takes place at different points in time (1971, 1985, and 1999) in which two events that happened in 1971 come full circle in 1999. There is no real ending to this story except for the one in the reader's mind. This is what a good short story should be like. It should leave the reader wondering what will happen after all the stories secrets are revealed. Another one of my favorites is WRONG NUMBERS by Josh Pryor.<br />There are some other good stories in the anthology written by Dennis Lehane, Shel Silverstein and Jeffery Deaver.	2002-01-05

Her main character is Maureen O'Donnell, an emotionally battered woman, who is trying to gain control of her own life after recuperating from a nervous breakdown months before. She is working on a dead end job that she hates and found out recently that her lover, Douglas, is married. That day she decides to get drunk before going home to bed. When she wakes up the next morning with a hangover, she discovers Douglas tied to a chair and with his throat slit.<br />Maureen has very few people to stand up for her. The police are having trouble believing her story and are suspicious of her actions. She is estranged from her family due to an incident in her past as well as having an alcoholic mother. Ms. Mina does a good job relating O' Donnell's dysfunctional family showing the family dynamic and how everybody is willing to think the worst of Maureen without giving her the benefit of the doubt. Douglas was a doctor where Maureen was recuperating from her breakdown and having an affair with him. The whole book shows how the main character does not wish to become a victim and fighting tooth and nail for it. She becomes very defensive about her past and tries not to take any guff from anybody. She becomes so frustrated with everybody that she decides to do an investigation herself.<br />The main problem I faced with the novel is the resolution of the crime. I am not spoiling the book, but the problem I had was with the culprit (or guilty party) involved in Douglas' murder. There was no satisfying, clear-cut explanation for why that character committed its actions. It left me with several questions that will not be answered in this book. I think that this is something that makes GARNETHILL a better book. It forces one to focus more on Maureen O'Donnell's character than with her surroundings or supporting cast.<br />I am looking forward to read Ms. Mina's second novel, EXILE.  This book marks the return of Maureen and hopefully it might answer some of the questions I might have from this book.	2002-01-01

The first half of the book had me interested, but midway through the stories, my passion for them waned.<br />My favorite story in the group was the first one (BLIND LEMON by Doug Allyn). It was a moving story in which two strangers reunite ten years later after getting their friend killed. Due to guilt as well as fear, they both go their separate ways trying to escape the tragedy. They see each other at a bar where one of them is performing. The story was very poignant and heartfelt. I wish Mr. Allyn success with his other works.<br />My main disappointment was with Jonathan Kellerman's THE THINGS WE DO FOR LOVE. It was a good story and it could have been a surprise to the reader. Unfortunately, it is in a book about mysteries. If things seem a little too ordinary three quarters of the book, then there must be a twist somewhere in the end. I think this story would have worked better in an anthology of love or family stories, as well as in a magazine guided towards women.<br />It is good to read short stories every once in a while to discover new and promising authors. As I previously stated, nothing really stands out in this particular anthology, however, I recommend the 1998 as well as the 1999 Best Mystery stories. You will find some pleasant surprises in them.	2001-12-30
US	53045954	R1NSY2YYZHK9G1	0671047329	644541461	The Third Option	Books	4	9	11	N	N	The beginning of a major storyline	In THE THIRD OPTION, Vince Flynn brings back his character of Mitch Rapp, whom he made famous in TRANSFER OF POWER. In this novel, Rapp is sent to assassinate a German citizen by order of the President of the United States. It is a top-secret mission for which the President will have total deniability should be Mitch be exposed to the situation. Things do not go quite as plan and Mitch manages to escape from Germany without being caught.<br />Flynn exposes a Washington conspiracy in which certain individuals want to embarrass the President as well as the CIA. The head of the CIA is dying of cancer and the Senate and the House of Representatives are discrediting his chosen successor. The action in this book is taut and suspenseful. I enjoyed it.<br />The author brings backs characters from his previous works and have them play important roles in the novel. He is preparing them up for the continuation of the storyline, which I assume will be reflected in SEPARATION OF POWER. This story does have a self-contained beginning and end, but some readers might not like that the main villain does not get his comeuppance. I think it is important just to meet the character, see what he is capable off and hope that he gets his `just desserts' in the next book.	2001-12-26
US	53045954	RK1TJIGM113CW	0395939151	389303269	The Best American Mystery Stories 1999	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Thought-provoking stories	I enjoyed this collection of the best mystery stories published in 1999. There are some familiar authors in this book such as Phillip Margolin, Lawrence Block, and Jeffery Deaver. These authors stand out for themselves so I will not comment on them but make note on the overlooked authors.<br />My two favorite stories are SACRIFICE by L. L. Thrasher and OUT THERE IN THE DARKNESS by Ed Gorman. The first one involves a mother's extreme measures to protect her daughter's innocence. It is L. L. Thrasher's first short story and an excellent one at that. The story is heartbreaking but it makes you think twice of how precious innocence is to a child. Ignorance is bliss but the truth here is very dangerous.<br />OUT THERE IN THE DARKNESS involves a group of poker buddies who stop a burglar from robbing their house. They decide not to call the police but to handle things themselves and try to get information from the criminal. Everything then backfires and the four friends are now fighting to stay alive. One of the themes here is the danger of becoming a vigilante and the consequences one must pay.<br />Overall, most of the stories in this collection are good and I recommend it as an aperitif before trying out a novel by one of the authors. I would like to make also an honorary mention with SAFE by Gary A. Braunbeck. It will make you think twice about cleaning houses.	2001-12-24
US	53045954	R37GFBSKDN23GB	0312874529	871471826	Retribution: A Lew Fonesca Mystery (Lew Fonesca Novels)	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Welcome back, Mr. Fonesca	Early this year I was pleasantly surprised when I read VENGEANCE by Stuart Kaminsky. I was expecting a short, quick and probably forgettable novel. Boy, was I mistaken. The characters are very down-to-earth trying to find some happiness with their lives. All the characters have a point of weakness (alcoholism, loneliness, anger, among others) that they are trying to conquer in their lives day by day. The main character in this series is Lew Fonesca, a process server who is now living in Sarasota while trying to escape his former life in Chicago. He is trying to move forward ever since the accidental death of his wife Catherine. Through his work, he meets a lot of people who later become his friends as well as allies.<br />In RETRIBUTION, most of the characters from the previous novel returns including Adele, a runaway who was the main focus in VENGEANCE. In this book a few months have passed. Adele is living a happier life, going to school, and winning prizes in writing competitions. A reclusive author (a la J. D. Salinger) befriends her and tries to help her with her writing. A few months later, Adele runs away from the author's house, stealing all his unpublished works and threatening to destroy every single page slowly. Fonesca is on the case because he is truly concerned about Adele. He cares for her and also has a support network of friends that also cares for Adele. The bad news is that most people of the people Adele encounters during her escapade are winding up dead. Lew is going everything that is necessary to bring Adele back to safety as well as bring more stability to his life.<br />My only complaint about this book is the self-righteousness of Adele's character. She refuses to tell anyone why she is doing what she is doing until the very end. Her behavior was a little extreme and I would have liked to read more about the circumstances that led to her actions. All this is explained in about two pages of text which leaves the reader a bit in the lurch. <br />For everything else, I like the Lew Fonesca series and I intend to continue it as long as I can. I am also going to try to read  Kaminsky's other works to see if I feel the same way about his other series characters.	2001-12-22
US	53045954	R3PMJ85I88NZUW	0395835852	937603272	The Best American Mystery Stories 1998 (The Best American Series)	Books	4	6	6	N	N	A nice read	Doing a review on an anthology is not easy since there are a multitude of stories written by several authors. This book comprises a collection of the best mystery stories of 1998. Sue Grafton was right in saying most of the stories are crime novels, which is precisely what they are. I was pleasantly surprised by two of the stories, CHILD SUPPORT by David Ballard and SECRETS by Janice Law.<br />In the first story, the author takes a simple child custody story as told by the point of view of the father. He then gets into an extraordinary circumstance that jeopardizes his relationship with his son. What makes this story interesting is that it is narrated by the ex-husband, leaving the reader with the preconceptions left by the storyteller. One must remember a lesson given to us by Agatha Christie in some of her books. It is never to take the narrator's story as face value. It is not till one reaches the end that one gets the rest of the story.<br />SECRETS was another delightful surprise. It is a revenge story several years in the making. Its main theme is the power of motherhood and the extremes that they will go in protecting their children.<br />Another interesting aspect of this book is a story by Stuart Kaminsky called FIND MIRIAM. It is an abbreviated version of his novel VENGEANCE. I assume he wrote the short story before he decided to make it a novel. It takes a genius to implement that same story in a novel and I think Kaminsky pulls it off.	2001-12-21
US	53045954	R3B1NTNYQ1Q1HF	0451183339	177360042	Precipice	Books	3	4	5	N	N	I wished I liked it but I did not.	I really wanted to like PRECIPICE, but no matter how hard I tried I just did not like it. Most of the characters are not whom or what they claim to be and we know that the protagonist is portraying someone she is not. All it did was confuse me more and more and made it hard for me to enjoy it.<br />The only other book written by Savage that I have read is VALENTINE. That novel really kept me guessing and I enjoyed it from beginning to end. (I, however, am not interested in seeing the `movie'). I have SCAVENGER in my pile of books to read and hopefully I will like that one better.	2001-12-18
US	53045954	RI682LWM2Q6QH	0345446976	693427296	24/7	Books	2	4	6	N	N	24/7 fails on so many levels	The book starts when a last-minute contestant, Dana Kirsten, arrives at Vassa Island to participate in the latest reality show called 24/7. In this game contestants are stranded on an island that is totally surrounded by hidden cameras as well as cameras the contestants wear at all time. Every three days, the viewing public would vote one person of the island. If any contestant acquires any 'safety stones' during the game, he or she gets to remove 10% of the vote already accumulated for every stone collected. The last person standing will win two million dollars and their heart's desire. <br />The problem starts when everybody who is not a contestant drops dead AT THE SAME TIME, due to an ebola-like virus that every contestant is infected with. At that moment, a garbled computer voice identifies himself as CONTROL. It states that the game is in play and that every day at noon, a contestant will be killed at the end of each viewer vote. The remainder will get a 24-hour vaccine that will help them live for another day.<br />In my opinion the book is a royal mess. There are too many characters involved, too many unrelated situations, too much implausibility. Where can one find a virus that works at precisely twelve o'clock? Where were the producers of the show while this was going on? How come nobody had a clue that the 'safety stone' games were going to be dangerous? Didn't the game builders figured there was something dangerous with the sets they were constructing? When did everybody figure out that Zodiac signs were involved?<br />There were too many scenes that were skipped or ignored. There were too many settings that were a little too convenient. The author wants to show how extreme voyeuristic television has become but he rarely talks about the viewers. The only time we know about the viewers is when the find which of the 638 cameras will show a contestant stripping. How is the public going to be ashamed with voting somebody for death if we don't get to see howthey vote? <br />There is so much more I could say about this book but I am going to stop here. If you want to read about a fictional reality show, I recommend the Richard Bachman (a.k.a. Stephen King) novella, THE RUNNING MAN. Forget about the Schwarzenegger movie. The message from the book is not the same as in the film.	2001-12-16
US	53045954	R37HNC4JY8YFUL	038097729X	432838089	Paradise Lost (Joanna Brady Mysteries, Book 9)	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Magnificent	This one of my all-time favorite series. One of the reasons that I appreciate this series is that I have read the first book in the series, DESERT HEAT, first. I liked it so much that I managed to read every other book in the series in sequence getting to know each of the main characters well. One reason the series is good is that an ordinary woman (Joanna Brady) becomes an extraordinary woman (Sheriff Joanna Brady) by circumstances beyond her control, but still finds the time to become an ordinary woman (a loving mother to her daughter, Jenny as well as newlywed wife to her new husband, Butch). PARADISE LOST is my all-time favorite book in this series. (...)<br />In this novel, a time of a month and a half has passed since DEVIL'S CLAW. Joanna and Butch are back from their honeymoon in France and are now adjusting to married life. During a Girl Scout camping trip, Jenny (Joanna's daughter) and her tentmate find a body of a woman, while Joanna is eight hours away from town attending a Sheriff's convention as well as attending the wedding of Butch's friend. Later, Jenny's friend is killed in a hit-and-run accident and that's when things start to get dicey.<br />Joanna Brady has matured gracefully from a grieving policeman's widow to Sheriff of Cochise County in Arizona. She is no longer a neophyte and knows how to give orders and get things done. It is always a pleasure to see her friends, Maryanne Maculyea, Jeff Daniels, Kristin, among others. These characters also change as each book comes along and one is always wondering what's going to happen next. I was disappointed that Angie Kellogg did not make an appearance in this book but it is the richness Ms. Jance gives to all her other characters that makes it a special series.<br />(...)	2001-12-16
US	53045954	R1KOXX3N5RLKC3	0684849046	754969196	The Deadhouse	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Did not enjoy it as much as I did  her previous works	The book starts with a `staged murder' of an abused wife in order to fool her dangerous husband. Unfortunately, a few hours after he is arrested, his wife is strangled and thrown into an elevator shaft. The question is: Did the husband have a backup plan to kill his wife?<br />I will not spoil the book, but I was unhappy with the story itself. It is good to familiarize myself with the characters that I left behind in COLD HIT, however, the story is not really about them. It involves an abandoned hospital, located in Roosevelt Island, where very sick immigrants would be taken in order to die. Lola Dakota (the aforementioned wife) has an interest in this place that will be made clear at the end of the book. There are conspiracies, hit-and-runs, and old secrets involved in the mystery of the abandoned hospital. <br />Alexandra Cooper (Fairstein's protagonist) goes through the paces to solve the problem in this book but I think it would have preferred it had this book not been part of the series. I enjoyed Cooper in the other books and I suggest you try them.	2001-12-14

On the day she holds an important party for him in his honor, he makes an abrupt departure. He leaves on her doorstep a diary written by his former wife that is dedicated to their son, Nicholas. Matt leaves Katie a note asking her to read this diary in order to understand why he had to leave party so quickly.<br />I listened to the unabridged audiobook version of this book. Granted I had a cold, but I was left crying like a baby after listening to this heartbreaking story. The story as written by Suzanne was very emotional and her deep feelings and thoughts are beautifully portrayed in this work. It does explain a lot but I would think that someone as `wonderful' as Matt would have tried to talk to Katie at some point. If my review makes me a sap for liking it, so be it.	2001-12-13
US	53045954	RNO4Q6KIHS1NR	0385334834	51290485	Writ of Execution	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Too convoluted	WRIT OF EXECUTION begins right where MOVE TO STRIKE ends, and all I was left with when I finished was a big `huh?'. <br />In the latest in the Nina Reilly series, Ms. Reilly helps a jackpot winner who does not wish to be identified because she is afraid of being found by her harasser. If this were the only primary story in this book I would probably had given it a higher rating. However, Perri O'Shaughnessy also includes in this book a casino fraud, a personal secret her client is hiding, a mystery illness, an unstable killer and gambler who wants what is \\"rightfully his\\", a teenage boy suffering from leukemia and finally, Nina's relationship with her detective, Paul Van Wagoner.<br />There were too many things going on with this story that at the end I did not care how everything turned out. I probably would have more empathy with the leukemia patient if he did not appear only sporadically in the book.<br />Will this book deter me from reading the next O' Shaughnessy book? Probably not. Their other books are still good. I strongly recommend INVASION OF PRIVACY and MOTION TO SUPPRESS.	2001-12-12
US	53045954	R37J4EDO3BZZZF	0399147357	486821945	Dead Sleep	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Excellent novel	With the exception of BLACK CROSS, I have read every Greg Iles' novels. DEAD SLEEP is one of his best books ever written right after 24 HOURS and THE QUIET GAME.<br />In his latest novel, his main character is Jordan Glass, a professional photographer and journalist. During the past year and a half she has been taking unnecessary risks in her job and losing focus of her life. Thirty years ago her father went missing while working as a photojournalist during the Vietnam War and a year ago, a serial kidnapper based in New Orleans, kidnapped her identical twin sister. She left behind two kids and a husband and up to that point the FBI had no clues as to her whereabouts.<br />While trying to put her life together, Jordan goes to Hong Kong to work on her dream project, publishing a book on her pictures of weather phenomena. A friend of hers encourages a visit to a museum where she can see some beautiful watercolors on display. During her sightseeing she can't help but wonder as to why everybody in the building was staring at her. It is not until she sees an exhibit titled `The Sleeping Women' when her life is torn asunder. This particular exhibit involves several paintings of nude female models that appear to be dead in the pictures. Jordan's sister is one of them. This takes her on an nightmarish ride in which she works with the NOPD and the FBI in trying to find the person responsible for those pictures and as the fate of her sister and the other missing girls. It seems each portrait represents a missing New Orleans woman kidnapped during the same time frame a Jordan's sister.<br />The story is very suspenseful and it kept me up until the wee hours trying to finish this book. I really enjoyed the characters in the book. My only complaint with the book involved the identity of the painter. I thought his reason for his madness was a little clichéd in mystery novels. Do not let this stop you, it is still a great book.	2001-12-10

Decker manages to solve the case but he's left with an uncomfortable resolution. After being caught, the guilty party does restitution and then six month later goes to a summer camp for troubled rich kids. It is then that he is killed together with his therapist. Naturally, Decker feels that this is retribution from the cohort who may also have been involved in the act of vandalism. Lets just say that it does not turn out that way.<br />The second plot in the book is of more interest that involves Decker's youngest stepson Jacob. Since the beginning of Kellerman's Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus series he has been troubled due to certain circumstances in previous novels. He is now a recovering drug-addict who is trying hard to make amends for everything he's done. The bad part about it in this book is that he is familiar with the players involved in Peter's case. Something he is not to thrilled about. In the end he manages to help the police solve the case and have some one-on-one time with his stepdad. They talk in the end and it end in a funny note. In essence I liked the book and I recommend it.	2001-12-07
US	53045954	RFRKVBYY5AYBI	0312976437	810705234	A Dangerous Road	Books	5	6	6	N	N	A Dangerous Road, An Excellent Book	This book is one of the best novels I have read this year and has the well-deserved distinction of having been nominated for the Edgar Award for best mystery. The Bottoms by Joe R. Lansdale is good but I consider Ms. Nelscott's novel to be better.<br />Her main character is Smokey Dalton, a jack-of-all-trades who also finds work as a private investigator in Memphis, Tennessee. We learn that he was a former school classmate with Martin Luther King, Jr. and he is as happy as he can be living his life. Unfortunately, his world is about to be turned upside-down when he meets Laura Hathaway, who flew all the way from Chicago to look for him. It seems her mother left Smokey an inheritance for $10,000 and she wants to know why her mother willed him that money. He later discovers that Laura has a lot of questions regarding her mother and she hires Dalton to investigate. What Dalton discovers is a sinister connection with Ms. Hathaway that will change their lives forever.<br />The story takes place during the late sixties when Martin Luther King was active with the sanitation strikes occurring in the South. Dalton experiences prejudice, hatred, violence and turmoil throughout the entire book which in the end will only make him stronger.<br />Ms. Nelscott does an excellent job in developing this character that keeps the reader entranced to the plot. There is also a story of a little boy whose mother abandoned him and his brother is contributing to his possible delinquency by involving him as a drug courier and making him cut school. Dalton does his best to try to save this boy.<br />There is so much I would like to say about this book, but it is better if you read it and make up your own minds. You will be glad you did. I am also looking forward to reading Smokey Dalton's next book SMOKE-FILLED ROOMS which is now available.	2001-12-06
