Eric Romstead would be the first to admit he didn't know everything there was to know about his father.  Hell, he hadn't even seen the old man in four years.  But when he's told by police that his father was killed in a drug deal gone bad, he knows full well that isn't the real story.<br /><br />Man on a Leash by Charles Williams is an exciting, suspenseful murder mystery told as a third person narration.  Williams consistently employs detailed descriptive passages that serve to draw the reader right into the action packed plot as it swiftly unfolds.  Moreover, Eric Romstead, his murdered father Gunnar and key supportive characters are well fleshed out and realistically depicted.<br /><br />This is a fine example of mystery writing.  A compelling story with realistic characters told in straightforward fashion.  You can't ask for more than that.  Highly recommended.	2005-09-29

In it, the lives of key family members are laid bare as the years and decades go by. <br /> <br />Ninety-five year old Thomas Henry Oliver is the patriarch of the clan.  Known simply as Oliver or, at times, The Old Man, he manages to overcome his hardscrabble origins in rural Ohio to accrue great wealth in the New Orleans of the early 20th century.  With little formal education, Oliver achieves remarkable success in business seemingly through sheer willpower and a dogged brand of toughness. <br /> <br />Oliver's two daughters Anna and Margaret both display a sense of entitlement when it comes to their father's money.  But in other aspects of their lives they couldn't be more different.  Anna believes in the importance of hearth and home and later on in the book becomes hyper-religous in very disturbing ways.  Margaret is wild and promiscuous, seemingly incapable of bringing focus to her own life. <br /> <br />The fourth of the major characters in The Condor Passes is Robert Caillet, a poor Cajun youth Oliver takes on as his protege.  He eventually marries Anna and thereby becomes Oliver's heir apparent.  Quite pathetically, Robert's personal life becomes defined by his insatiable need for sexual encounters with many women. <br /> <br />The Condor Passes is a 4 star effort.  There's much to enjoy in this powerful tale of one family's triumphs and tragedies.  A provocative, engaging read.	2005-09-21

The legendary Frederick Forsyth uses his considerable storytelling skill to relate this short but powerful tale.  A young RAF fighter pilot becomes lost in the fog on his way home for the Christmas holiday.  Just as he is about to run out of fuel, another plane miraculously appears and guides him to safety. <br />The Shepherd is a very well written, haunting short story.  One that would have made an excellent episode of The Twilight Zone or perhaps Alfred Hitchcock's old series.	2005-09-07
US	48738119	RYVOY4DFJBJAQ	0743403533	383165877	The Nominee	Books	4	1	1	N	N	An engaging, fun read.	Few fictional characters score as high in the category of likeability as does Jack Flynn, The Nominee's main character and sometime narrator.  Jack is an investigative reporter for The Boston Record, New England's most respected daily newspaper. <br /> <br />Two major storylines dominate the narrative of The Nominee.  Lance Randolph, the governor of Massachusetts, has just been nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General.  Jack has reason to believe Randolph has a secret in his background that will scuttle his Senate confirmation and is waiting for the right moment to go to press with what he knows.  Secondly, when Jack's close friend Paul Ellis, the Record's CEO, becomes a homicide victim, Jack takes it upon himself to identify the murderer, thereby placing his own life in jeopardy. <br /> <br />This highly readable novel has many interesting subplots which serve to flesh out Jack's persona.  Like his on again, off again relationship with the lovely Elizabeth Riggs, a reporter for a rival Boston paper.  Furthermore, author Brian McGrory's writing style is quite engaging, consistently displaying an unselfconscious brand of wit throughout. <br /> <br />A solid 4 stars for this second novel in the Jack Flynn series.  It's a great follow-up to McGrory's equally engaging first effort, The Incumbent.	2005-09-06
US	48738119	RUAPGB77I0DAA	0375726772	338943192	State of Siege	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Great on many levels.	In the part of the world once known as the East Indies, The Republic of Sunda, a former Dutch colonial outpost, struggles with its new found independence.  Unfortunately, the ruling government is both corrupt and ineffectual, setting the stage for civil war. <br /> <br />Steve Fraser, a British engineer completely disinterested in the nuances of internal Sundanese politics, finds himself right in the middle of the military conflict.  In typical Eric Ambler fashion, he becomes the novel's unlikely protagonist. <br /> <br />State of Siege is a remarkable work of fiction.  In it, Ambler touches on a number of geopolitical issues without clubbing the reader over the head with dogma.  Moreover, neither the government nor the rebels are presented as being morally superior to the other.  Both are shown to be seriously flawed entities.  In other words, rather than romanticizing the conflict, Ambler presents it with realism. <br /> <br />The narrative is taut, fast paced and compelling.  Quite an achievement especially when one considers that well over 50% of the story unfolds entirely within the confines of a single  building.  Originally published in 1956, State of Siege contains a number of important messages remarkably relevant to today's international scene.  Highly recommended.	2005-08-28

Eight stories which originally appeared in Black Mask magazine between 1923 and 1933 are reprinted in this delightful and highly readable book.  The featured stories are:<br /><br />-Three Gun Terry by Carroll John Daly<br /><br />-Bodies Piled Up by Dashiell Hammett (reprinted elsewhere as \\"House Dick\\")<br /><br />-Hell's Kettle by Erle Stanley Gardner<br /><br />-Sal the Dude by  Raoul Whitfield<br /><br />-Rough Justice by Frederick Nebel<br /><br />-Frost Flies Alone by Horace McCoy<br /><br />-Gundown by Paul Cain (originally titled \\"Murder Done in Blue\\")<br /><br />-Blackmailers Don't Shoot by Raymond Chandler<br /><br />These stories all exemplify the tough guy, shoot 'em up style of crime fiction that made Black Mask the popular literary outlet it was for so many years.  Editor Tom Nolan introduces each work with a short, candid biographical sketch of its author and some very brief comments about its fictional protagonist.  With the exception of Gundown by Paul Cain, each story stars a recurring or serialized character.<br /><br />In most cases, the plotting is less than airtight but all eight stories are fast paced and action packed.  The most engaging is Hell's Kettle by Erle Stanley Gardner.  It features the hardboiled Ed Jenkins who is quite adept at using his fists or a handy submachine gun when the situation arises.  Remarkably enough, Jenkins is also a master of disguise and a fluent speaker of unaccented Cantonese.<br /><br />This book contains a considerable amount of interesting information on the history of Black Mask magazine.  Published between 1920 and 1951, Black Mask enjoyed a heyday between 1926 and 1936 under the able editorship of Joseph Thompson Shaw.  Nolan points out how Shaw actively cultivated the writing talent that gave the magazine its enviable reputation.<br /><br />The Black Mask Boys rates 5 stars.  Highly recommended to pulp fiction fans and to those interested in learning about the historical underpinnings of the genre.	2005-08-27

Raymond Chandler, Jim Thompson, William Campbell Gault, Cornell Woolrich, Jonathan Craig and James Ellroy are each represented by one of their works.  Also included is a short but hard hitting preface by Mr. Ellroy.<br /><br />Each of these stories was filmed as a half hour TV show and aired on the cable network Showtime in 1993.  Immediately after each story is presented in its original form, it is followed by the teleplay used to adapt it to the TV format.  In all cases, there are substantive differences between the original and the adaptation.<br /><br />The book's subtitle: Six Noir Tales Told for Television is a bit misleading.  Story number 2, The Frightening Frammis, was written by the legendary Jim Thompson, one of noir's grandmasters.  Now I suppose it could be argued as to what is noir and what isn't.  But this particular story (and it happens to be a good one) just does not fit the noir mold.  Instead of the brutally stark and gut wrenching take on reality that is noir's stock and trade, The Frightening Frammis is rife with slapstick comedy and other way over the top devices.  Interestingly, the accompanying teleplay simplifies the narrative quite a bit and in doing so eliminates much of the over the top material.<br /><br />The most intriguing short story in this collection is the final one, Since I Don't Have You by James Ellroy.  It unfolds over a two day period in the Los Angeles of 1949 and has as supporting characters two real life figures, Howard Hughes and gangster Mickey Cohen.<br /><br />Fallen Angels is definitely a worthwhile read.  It's particularly interesting to see how screenwriters must both add to and subtract from the original work of others to create a final product suitable for TV or film.	2005-08-20
US	48738119	REJNRA8T0O8CB	0679723226	2859176	Double Indemnity	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Wonderfully entertaining.	H.S. Nirdlinger (Don't ya just love that name?) is a very unfortunate individual.  After all, his wife Phyllis and his insurance agent Walter are complete strangers to each other at the story's onset.  Yet within the first few pages, the two of them are earnestly conspiring to rub Nirdlinger out for a big insurance payoff. <br /> <br />This delightful book, a novella really, has two aspects to it.  On the one hand it's a noir crime story that oh so explicitly reveals the human capacity for heartlessness, cruelty and greed.  At the same time, it's in many ways a black comedy wherein cleverly laid criminal plans wind up backfiring in the most ironic ways. <br /> <br />In any event, Double Indemnity is an outstanding work of fiction.  The plot is a nifty one and the dialogue is smart and engaging.  Moreover, Cain's detailed descriptions of the inner workings of the insurance industry lend authenticity to the narrative. <br /> <br />Double Indemnity is great fun.  Read it.  You won't be disappointed.	2005-08-14

The multiple ramifications of long held family secrets that fester and repeat themselves permeate The Underground Man and give it its backbone.  As a ferocious wildfire engulfs the eastern outskirts of the oceanside community of Santa Teresa, California, author Ross Macdonald leads us through a complex maze of dysfunctional relationships involving members of three intertwined families.<br /><br />The narration is provided by hardboiled PI Lew Archer as he seeks to return Ronald Broadhurst, a six year old kidnap victim, to the arms of his frantic mother.  Of course, as with all Ross Macdonald novels, the case at hand only represents the tip of the iceberg.  Archer, ever the tenacious investigator, finds that a series of unhappy events ocurring in the distant past has culminated in little Ronny's abduction.<br /><br />Fast paced and compelling, the narrative of The Underground Man is artfully written.  Macdonald employs countless descriptive phrases that are deliciously original and extremely....well, descriptive.  The dialogue is engaging and authentic sounding.  And the many characters are sketched out in a way that gives them a realistic feel.  As for the plot, it's an intricate one.  Ross Macdonald novels are never otherwise.  Artful, challenging and satisfying, The Underground Man is an excellent example of Macdonald's best work.	2005-08-13

Each of its 17 chapters is a compelling mini masterpiece of storytelling.<br /><br />The title character is a young financially challenged mother who is forced to fend for herself in the decidedly unfriendly milieu of Depression era Los Angeles.  After considerable struggle and plenty of hard work, Mildred eventually becomes a successful business woman.<br /><br />But while Mildred is achieving economic independence, her daughter Veda, a precocious 11 year old at the novel's onset, matures into a hateful, greedy young adult who makes her mother's life a living hell.<br /><br />Author James Cain has offered up a virtuoso performance in the writing of this wonderful novel.  Chapter 1 is pure genius.  It starts off with images of perfect domesticity; a husband doing yardwork and a wife decorating a cake.  Then it suddenly spirals downward into the abyss of irretrievable family break-up.  Each subsequent chapter is masterfully built on the one before to paint a vivid picture of Mildred's world as she wends her way through the obstacle course that is her life.<br /><br />Mildred Pierce is a gripping, page turner of a novel.  An enthusiastic 5 stars.	2005-08-08
US	48738119	R1CFCZE5CAAMQ	0553297422	131345277	The Deceiver	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Secrets of a spy.	The Deceiver by Frederick Forsyth is a collection of four novellas all featuring Sam McCready, a veteran agent for the British Secret Intelligence Service.  It's the waning days of the cold war and the SIS has made the decision to scale down its field operations.  Consequently, McCready is targeted for early retirement.  As a colleague argues before the powers-that-be to allow Sam to stay on as an active operative, four of his most interesting cases are reviewed one by one.    Pride and Extreme Prejudice takes place in 1981.  Sam is handed the task of obtaining a top secret volume of classified military information from a high ranking Soviet army officer who is cooperating with the CIA.  The turnover is to be made in East Germany.  There's just one problem.  The West German agent Sam has hired to make the pick up is a desperate man who will surely bring the mission to a disasterous end.  A smartly told, suspenseful and satisfying tale of cold war intrigue.    The Price of the Bride also unfolds against the backdrop of the cold war.  A colonel in the KGB defects to the CIA choosing to do so on British soil.  As the compelling narative unfolds, doubts are raised as to the Russian's veracity.  Sam McCready is there to skillfully ferret out the truth while the plot twists and turns almost to the breaking point.  An intricate chess game of a story.    Novella number three is entitled A Casualty of War and takes place mostly on Cyprus.  It revolves around a sinister collaboration between Libya's Colonel Qaddafi and the IRA.  A series of terrorist attacks are to be carried out in England and McCready must act swiftly to prevent them from happening.  The detailed descriptions of how terrorists and counterterrorists ply their respective trades are quite fascinating.    And lastly, A Little Bit of Sunshine has McCready visiting a tiny British colonial outpost in the Carribean.  This novella differs from the other three in that it unfolds more as a whodunit with comic undertones than as a conventional spy story.    All in all, The Deceiver rates 4 stars.  Fans of international thrillers will doubtlessly derive considerable enjoyment from reading it.	2005-08-03

The Postman Always Rings Twice by James Cain is a seminal work of the noir genre.  Gritty and emotionally wrenching, this book unapologetically exposes the dark underbelly of human nature.   <br /> <br />When waitress Cora Papadakis and aimless drifter Frank Chambers first meet, the mutual animal attraction is powerful.  So powerful, in fact, the two of them conspire to do away with Cora's husband, a hapless Greek immigrant. I don't think it would be giving anything away to say things end badly for all concerned. <br /> <br />A short novel with plenty of dialogue, The Postman Always Rings Twice is a very quick read.  Interestingly, the passage of time has served to alter reader perception.  The sex scenes, deemed positively scandalous when the book was first published, are rather tame by today's standards. Nevertheless, you will not want to miss this viscerally intense classic.	2005-07-24
US	48738119	R36DOPN0A4KK9M	0679733124	952003400	Wild Town	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Web of deception.	The unlikely protagonist of Wild Town answers to the name Bugs McKenna.  An ex-cop and an ex-con, Bugs cannot stay out of trouble because of his hair trigger temper and his inability to cut the other guy any slack.  Another major character is Lou Ford, the sinister lawman introduced by Thompson in his 1952 classic work, The Killer Inside Me.  As pointed out by Robert Polito in the definitive Thompson biography entitled Savage Art, Wild Town is neither a sequel nor a prequel to The Killer Inside Me.  It's best to think of the two books as presenting the Lou Ford character in alternate universes.    Bugs drifts into West Texas' Ragtown and soon meets up with deputy sheriff Ford, who strongly suggests he accept the job of house detective at the Hanlon Hotel.  The owner of the hotel is Mike Hanlon, a wealthy oilman who became paraplegic in an industrial accident.    Wild Town is a relatively short book, yet there are a number of intriguing subplots.  And Thompson wastes no time in introducing them.    -All is not well between Mike Hanlon and his wife, giving Bugs   and the reader reason to believe murder is in the air.  -Bugs find himself attracted to school marm Amy Standish who just   happens to be Lou Ford's fiancee.  -The Hanlon's auditor is an embezzler and its general manager is   a world class alcoholic.  -Bugs becomes a recipient of an anonymous blackmail threat.    All of this and more plays out under the watchful eye of the omniscient Lou Ford.    Perhaps the strongest aspect of Wild Town is the very engaging dialogue.  Especially the fake hayseed utterances of Ford as he dominates and intimidates one and all.  Another strong feature of Wild Town is its depiction of hotel life.  You'd be hard pressed to find an author more capable than Jim Thompson when it comes to describing the inner workings of hotels.    What keeps this from being a really great novel, at least for me, is the tendency for many of the characters to do things which are....well, out of character.  Of course, that particular criticism is a bit unfair.  I suspect it was Thompson's intention to have these characters act in unforseeable ways so as to purposely keep the reader completely off balance.    I would rank Wild Town high among Thompson's second tier novels.  As you read this entertaining book, remember to expect the unexpected.	2005-07-15

But fate steps in and one of the men dies of a heart attack and has to be buried at sea.  But that's only the beginning. A couple days after reaching their destination on the Texas gulfcoast, the other man is brutally murdered. <br /> <br />At this point Rogers finds himself very much in demand.  Not only is he wanted for questioning by the police and the FBI, he is pursued by a gang of violent criminals. <br /> <br />The Sailcloth Shroud is a fast paced, well crafted mystery that unfolds very smoothly.  Author Charles Williams skillfully tells this interesting tale using Rogers himself as first person narrator.  One can't help but be impressed by the seamless incorporation of flashback scenes as a device to aid in the storytelling. <br /> <br />An engaging satisfying read.

But when it came to compiling his memoirs of military life, he chose to recount his experiences in the pre-war peacetime army, both stateside and overseas in the Philippines. <br />This book is the author's autobiography covering the years 1935 to 1939 or ages 16 to 20, when he served as an enlisted man first in the Army Air Corps and later in the cavalry. <br />Since Charles Willeford was a natural born storyteller, it's no surprise Something about a Soldier is an easy and interesting read.  Through dozens of anecdotes related by Willeford in his patented deadpan style, a funny but not particularly pretty picture emerges.  Senseless bureacracy, out of touch officers, mindless work and counterproductive regulations all conspired to make the author's experience during those years a less than satisfying one.   <br />But there were a couple positive aspects to this time in Willeford's life as well.  He had plenty of time to devote to improving his mind through reading.  And he enjoyed a very active sex life thanks to the always available prostitutes, camp followers and other willing women that were part of Willeford's military experience.  Though to be honest, many of the sexual exploits described sound less than appetizing. <br />Something about a Soldier is an entertaining and well written memoir.  The anecdotes recounted reveal a lot about army life and many of them are pricelessly funny.  Worthwhile reading for all Charles Willeford fans.	2005-07-09

This extremely fast paced story traces the activity of Gerry Kells, gentleman gangster, as he plies his trade in and around Los Angeles.  There are no heroes in this novel.  Only thieves, gamblers, gunmen, blackmailers and corrupt political bosses. <br />Kells is present in every scene.  If he's not being beaten up, he's doing the beating.  If he's not being framed for a crime, he's doing the framing.  Fast One is pulp fiction in its toughest, most socially irredeemable form.  An action packed, fun read.  But one that doesn't quite live up to the hype.  Unfortunately, the new Blackmask Online edition has an inordinate number of typographical errors that are irritatingly distracting.	2005-07-02

Everyone has heard of David Berkowitz, the \\"Son of Sam\\" killer who terrorized New York for over a year in the 1970s.  But few would recognize the name Craig Glassman, a very average everyman who just happened to occupy the apartment immediately below Berkowitz and wound up playing an instrumental role in his capture. <br /> <br />In Off the Wall, Charles Willeford gives the reader an interesting take on the severely deranged Berkowitz and his claustrophobic, delusional existence.  He does this by juxtaposing descriptions of the killer's life with descriptions of the life lived by his neighbor, Glassman. <br /> <br />Readers familiar with Willeford from his many fictional works will recognize certain aspects of his writing style here.  Like his matter-of-fact, but thorough, descriptions of everyday things such as food, clothing and furniture.  Generally speaking, this true crime book is not as engaging as Willeford's fiction.  The  reason for this is rather obvious.  Because Off the Wall deals with a very real, tragic crime complete with many real life victims, it would be disrespectful and out of place for the author to employ the cynical, iconoclastic and irreverent point of view that usually characterizes his work and in fact has become his trademark. <br /> <br />Off the Wall gives an informative and frightening look into the life and mind of David Berkowitz.  Definitely a worthwhile read, but one which does not afford Willeford the opportunity to display the unique talent responsible for his reputation as a great writer.	2005-06-27

In I Was Looking for a Street, Charles Willeford (1919-1988) tells in straightforward fashion what his early life was like.  Orphaned by age 8 and a rail riding drifter by age 13, Willeford's childhood was a tough one.  But there isn't an ounce of bitterness in this memoir.  Instead of cursing his misfortune, Willeford sees each setback he endured, no matter how terrible, as a learning experience.    With a minimal amount of sentimentality, Willeford tells how the middle class life he was born into rapidly evaporated when tuberculosis claimed both his parents and, a few years later, the Great Depression thrust his beloved grandmother Mattie into poverty.  He goes on to compellingly describe his life as a \\"road kid\\" among the hobos and tramps who hopped freight trains in a never ending journey to absolutely nowhere.    Fans of Willeford's novels and short stories will definitely want to read this short but amazing autobiography.  Told with the author's trademark matter-of-fact style, the anecdotes contained in I Was Looking for a Street are quite interesting and reveal a lot about the origins of Willeford's unique worldview. Highly recommended.	2005-06-25

The plotting is less than air tight, but that's easy to forgive in view of the stellar success author Cornell Woolrich achieves in setting mood and creating suspense. <br /> <br />Helen is about 19 years old, so we are told.  Pregnant and alone with exactly 17 cents to her name, her situation is dire to say the least.  But Fate steps in and through a confluence of highly unlikely circumstances associated with a horrible train wreck, she is given the opportunity to assume the identity of another young woman.  Now she and her newborn son can live a life filled with love, security, wealth and privilege. <br /> <br />But happiness obtained dishonestly comes at a terrible price.  Inevitably, Helen, now known as Patrice, is forced to confront her past.  As the reader stands by helplessly, Helen is pulled into a downward spiral of depravity from which there is no escape. <br /> <br />Except for the prologue and the epilogue, I Married a Dead Man is narrated in the third person.  Yet it is told completely from Helen's perspective.  The reader sees, hears and knows only what Helen sees, hears and knows.  This has the effect of allowing the reader to experience the fear and terror Helen faces right along with her.  Woolrich has written this novel in a style best described as haunting, almost surreal.  Suspense permeates each chapter as we know that, ultimately, disaster is unavoidable.  We just don't know how or when it will manifest itself. <br /> <br />Darkly moving, with a palpable aura of impending doom that is skillfully sustained from beginning to end, I Married a Dead Man is a great novel.  Highly recommended.	2005-06-21

To refer to Nick Chalmers of Pacific Point, California as a troubled young man would be completely understating the case.  The truth is he's guilt ridden to the point of being suicidal.<br /><br />Private eye Lew Archer, whose newest client is Nick's mother Irene, is determined to unravel the complex web of events that has brought Nick to the wretched mental state in which he now finds himself.<br /><br />The Goodbye Look serves up plenty of typical Ross Macdonald fare as the narrative, an exceedingly complex one even by Macdonald's standards, unfolds.  Three families, the Chalmers, the Truttwells and the Swains are plagued by a series of intertwined tragedies that have played out over 25 years and more.<br /><br />As Archer traverses much of the southern California landscape steadfastly trying to sort out this sordid saga of murder, larceny, infidelity, parental malfeasance and hidden identity, the reader is drawn into Macdonald's world.  A world where the sins of the father's are invariably visited upon the children and one's destiny is determined before one is old enough to have any say in the matter.<br /><br />Enhancing this book's interest quotient is the fact that Archer himself becomes an active participant in the ongoing soap opera when he engages in sex with a married woman.  Not just any married woman, but one who has, as it turns out, played a key role in the mystery Archer seeks to solve.<br /><br />As is the case in most Lew Archer novels, the dialogue and descriptive prose are first rate.  However, The Goodbye Look is not quite as strong as some of Macdonald's other work because the plot is so twisted that its unravelling raises as many questions as it answers.  Readers, particularly those who are already Ross Macdonald fans, will enjoy certain aspects of this book.  For example, a scene where clues are found by viewing a decades old home movie is particularly well written.  But overall, The Goodbye Look ranks a notch or two below the author's best work.	2005-06-17

The identity and motive of the would be assassin, immediately killed by the Secret Service, is a complete mystery.  As Jack works feverishly to find out the real story behind the shooting, he runs into a number of obstacles, most of them put in place by the government itself. <br /> <br />The incumbent of the book's title is President Clayton Hutchins, a man who has risen to the office of Commander-in-Chief without ever having been part of a nationally elected ticket.  Because of this unusual circumstance, he has never been fully vetted by the press and therefore could harbor some very dark secrets.  Could something like that happen in real life?  Well no, of course not.  But within the fictionalized world McGrory has created in this book, it makes sense. <br /> <br />I hate being a quibbler but there are two minor mistakes that bothered me.  In chapter 9, Jack is boarding a plane on the west coast at 9 a.m. when he receives a text message on his pager from a colleague in Washington, DC.  On reading the message, Jack comments to himself that it is only 6 a.m. in Washington.  Please correct me if I'm wrong, but if it's 9 a.m. on the west coast, isn't it 12 noon in Washington, not 6 a.m.?  It had already been established that Jack is a sophisticated traveler, acutely aware of time zone differences because of newspaper deadlines.  He'd have never made a 6 hour miscalculation like that.  And in chapter 17, as someone has already pointed out, McGrory has Jack exiting National Airport looking for a cab.  Two pages later hehas Jack driving away from the same airport in his own car.  These are unfortunate glitches which are surprising to find in a book that is otherwise well edited. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, I highly recommend The Incumbent. I found it to be a deftly plotted political thriller, satisfying and full of wit.  I look forward to reading other books by Brian McGrory.	2005-06-14
US	48738119	RWYP79MO1P69L	0060724226	195929310	The Hot Kid	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Law and disorder.	The Hot Kid is yet another example of Elmore Leonard doing what he does best.  Creating fascinating characters and then giving them plenty of authentic sounding dialogue to further enhance their appeal.  Prohibition era Oklahoma is brought to life in the pages of this delightful novel of cops and robbers.  The Hot Kid of the book's title is Carl Webster, a youth with nerves of steel, who becomes a Deputy U.S. Marshal working out of the Tulsa, Oklahoma office.  Carl likes the idea of bringing bank robbers to justice and in fact he's very good at it.  If some folks want to refer to him as a living legend, well who is he to argue?    Another Oklahoman by the name of Jack Belmont is about the same age as Carl.  Jack decides to pursue a career as a bank robber despite the fact his father is a millionaire oilman.  Sadistic and not very bright, Jack assumes the role of nemesis to the vain but heroic \\"Hot Kid\\".  Recording much of the action is Tony Antonelli, a reporter for True Detective magazine.  Tony is into his work so completely, the two cents a word he receives as payment is merely icing on the cake.  One has to believe he'd happily do the same work for free.  There are plenty of other interesting characters as well.  Like Carl's taciturn father, Virgil.  He's a proud veteran of the Spanish-American War who just can't quite figure out how his son came to be such an unreluctant object of hero worship.  And those beautiful, brazen gun molls, Crystal, Louly and Heidi.  Why their presence alone makes the book worth reading.    The Hot Kid is great entertainment.  If you like quirky characters and great dialogue, this is the book for you.	2005-06-08
US	48738119	R1XRZVTCEDG4LC	1842324209	433906440	Death Under Sail	Books	3	7	11	N	N	Hopelessly outdated.	Roger Mills is a physician and yachtsman.  One fine September morning while at the tiller of his boat, The Siren, Dr. Mills is murdered.  Shot through the heart at close range.  The suspect list is a short one as there were only 6 others on board at the time.  All of them the good doctor's invited guests. <br /> <br />Death Under Sail is one of those terribly clever British  <br />\\"drawing room\\" murder mysteries. You know the kind of book I'm talking about.  Someone is murdered early on and then an investigator with amazing powers of deduction is called upon to identify the perpetrator from amongst a finite collection of suspects. With said investigator usually revealing his or her findings in the course of a lengthy monologue at the novel's long awaited conclusion.  The supersleuth in this particular case is known by the name of Finbow.  Ian Capel, a friend of the victim, narrates the story and plays the part of Watson to Finbow's Holmes. <br /> <br />Finbow is a great believer in the role of psychology in crime solving and that's all well and good.  Unfortunately, the type of psychology he uses is based on totally unproven stereotypic beliefs regarding gender, age, occupation and, above all else, social class. <br /> <br />C.P. Snow (1905-1980) mentions in the book's introduction that he was 26 years old when he wrote Death Under Sail.  So this novel dates back to 1931 or perhaps slightly thereafter.  Now this brand of \\"whodunit\\" may have been quite the rage back then, but there is very little in it to appeal to the modern reader.  In other words, it flunks the test of time. <br /> <br />Death Under Sail is just too formulaic to distinguish itself from a host of similarly constructed detective novels.  Finbow and the rest of the characters are never fully developed.  And the entire narrative comes off as more of an exercise in mental gymnastics rather than a living breathing novel designed to engage the reader in any meaningful way.  This book is of historical interest only.  Those reading it for the type of enjoyment the author intended will be disappointed.	2005-06-04

Waltz into Darkness transports us to a time long ago, to the year 1880.  Louis Durand is a wealthy but lonely New Orleans bachelor who, early in the narrative, marries a comely young woman named Julia Russell.  But Louis and Julia are essentially strangers to each other.  Their courtship, such as it was, has taken place entirely by mail.  The first days of their marriage are quite blissful.  But then author Cornell Woolrich masterfully introduces ever increasingly unsubtle hints that Julia is other than she presents herself to be.  By the time Louis realizes he has made a terrible mistake in taking Julia as his wife, it's too late.  In the blink of an eye, he is removed from, what is to him, paradise and thrust into a hellish nightmare.  And that's just the beginning.  There's much, much more.    Waltz into Darkness is written as a third person narration.  By using an arcane sounding, flowery prose and incorporating a number of melodramatic embellishments, Woolrich expertly recreates the kind of writing one would expect to find in a Victorian era romance novel.  And his use of the element of suspense is no less than magnificent.  Time and time again he brings the reader right up to the heart pounding brink only to then pull back so the suspense can build once more.    This book is superbly crafted and shows what a virtuoso novelist Cornell Woolrich was.  Highly recommended.	2005-05-31

For many people, mention of the name Sam Spade quite understandably conjures up an image of Humphrey Bogart.  But Hammett had in mind a detective with a very different type of physicality.  His Sam Spade is tall and blond.  To look at him is to see a \\"blond satan\\". <br /> <br />In any event, the fast paced plot of The Maltese Falcon revolves around a mad race for possession of a priceless statuette, the falcon of the book's title. <br />Three supremely greedy thieves vie for sole ownership of the bejeweled bird.  They are: Brigid O'Shaughnessy (if that's her real name) the seductive femme fatale.  The well spoken, gluttonous Casper Gutman. And Joel Cairo, the effeminate \\"Levantine\\". <br /> <br />An unwary Sam Spade finds himself suddenly thrust into the midst of this unholy trinity's machinations as he seeks to find out who killed his partner in a shooting that takes place between the first two chapters. <br /> <br />Hammett's writing is extraordinarily strong.  He has a unique way of structuring his sentences in a simple yet elegant fashion.  The story itself is complex and far from spiritually uplifting.  Murder, greed, deception and double-crossing suffuse the entire narrative.  And the hardboiled Sam Spade, though certainly not satanic, is no Boy Scout to be sure. <br /> <br />The Maltese Falcon is arguably the book that brought the hardboiled crime novel into popular acceptance.  It's an American classic and a must read.	2005-05-26

Because it incorporates so many of the elements Macdonald held near and dear to his heart.  These include:  <br /> <br />-Family tragedies that repeat themselves over the generations. <br />-Unexpected familial relationships between characters.   <br />-A young person's journey to claim a birthright unfairly denied.   <br />-The notion that one's destiny is largely determined at birth, if not before. <br /> <br />The book starts out with Lew Archer being summoned to the  Woodland Hills home of Keith Sebastian and his wife Bernice.  Their 17 year old daughter has run away and they want Archer to find her without involving the police.  Archer soon learns that the girl is traveling in the company of a 19 year old delinquent named Davy Spanner.  What's more, it appears that they are planning to commit a very serious crime against Sebastian's boss, the fabulously wealthy oilman Stephen Hackett. <br /> <br />Archer wends his way up and down much of the California coast steadfastly seeking to unravel the truth behind the shocking series of events that rapidly ensue.  The fast paced narrative unfolds quite smoothly as one unexpected complication after another is brought to light. <br /> <br />And Macdonald's prose is first rate. Whether depicting the scenic landscapes of the California coastline or the changing face of American society as it reflects the turbulence of the 1960s, the writing is remarkably deft and descriptive.   <br /> <br />Thoroughly engaging, suspenseful and rich with surprise, The Instant Enemy ranks among the finest novels written by Ross Macdonald.  Do yourself a favor and read it.	2005-05-19

A Swell-Looking Babe contains material that many readers will find to be outside their comfort zone. To be more specific, the book has an underlying theme of Oedipal love which, in places, gets a bit graphic. <br /> <br />Much of the narrative takes place in the Manton Hotel. Bill \\"Dusty\\" Rhodes is the lone bellboy on the graveyard shift.  His dream of pursuing higher education has been put on hold because he has to work to support himself and his disabled father. Dusty's mother is deceased but her memory lives on in a  very unhealthy way in his mind. <br /> <br />One night a stunning woman, the swell-looking babe of the book's title, checks into the Manton.  Her name is Marcia Hillis and she reminds Dusty of dear old Mom.  Or could it be that it's not Marcia herself but rather it's the sensual response that Marcia arouses that makes Dusty think of his mother? <br /> <br />Rounding out the cast of characters are Bascom, the night desk clerk who may have a checkered past, and Tug Trowbridge, a crude racketeer who makes the Manton his home.   <br /> <br />The plot is a cleverly crafted one with a number of unexpected twists.  Suffice it to say that a serious crime takes place with young Mr. Rhodes unwillingly playing a central role. <br /> <br />A Swell-Looking Babe is worthy of a 5 star rating for a number of reasons.  It has great dialogue.  Thompson has his characters speak in ways that are well nuanced and authentic sounding.  The narrative unfolds smoothly even though it is at times difficult to determine whether something is actually happening or merely being imagined by the main character, Dusty Rhodes.  Rather than detracting from the novel's effectiveness, this blurring of the border between the real and the surreal serves to enhance reader involvement. Moreover, Thompson does a great job of describing what it's like at night in a hotel whose best days are behind it. <br /> <br />Few writers would have dared to pursue the Oedipal theme to the extent that Jim Thompson did in this book.  In doing so, he took a risky path which will undoubtedly turn off some readers.  <br />A Swell-Looking Babe is a fine example of Thompson at his iconoclastic best.  Well worth reading.	2005-05-16

Ross Macdonald was in top form when he wrote The Zebra-Striped Hearse.  I found this engaging Lew Archer mystery to be an incredibly compelling page turner of a novel.<br /><br />The narrative begins with ace PI Lew Archer being hired by Mark Blackwell, a wealthy, puritanical, ex-army colonel.  Blackwell's daughter Harriet has taken up with a penniless artist named Burke Damis.  And quite naturally, Dad does not approve.  So he hires Archer to look into Damis' background.<br /><br />Archer's subsequent investigation takes him to a number of different locales in California, Nevada and Mexico and proves to be quite fruitful.  He learns a number of disturbing things about Mr. Damis, including the fact that Damis is not his real name.<br /><br />But that's only the beginning.  Archer and the reader eventually learn that nothing is at it appears.  As the suspenseful plot unfolds, a hidden web of intrigue, deception and family dysfunction is skillfully unmasked.  And ultimately, the multifaceted plot all comes together at the stunningly effective conclusion.<br /><br />The Zebra-Striped Hearse is a prime example of Ross Macdonald at his very best.  An enthusiastic 5 stars.	2005-05-13

The Doomsters starts off with private eye Lew Archer being paid an early morning visit by an escaped mental patient named Carl Hallman. Archer notices that Carl is deeply troubled and confused yet surprisingly well spoken.  It appears that Carl's father, a very prosperous former state senator died 6 months earlier.  The death certificate says it was a heart attack.  But Carl has his doubts. <br /> <br />As Archer is drawn into the case, he gets to meet the members of Carl's very dysfunctional family.  There's his beautiful, long suffering wife, Mildred.  His not so brotherly brother, Jerry.  And his seductive sister-in-law, Zinnie.  Rounding out the cast of characters are a shady MD and a pot-bellied sheriff for whom Archer takes an immediate dislike. <br /> <br />The Doomsters is a skillfully told story of greed and betrayal.  Carl Hallman is a victim.  That much is clear from the very first chapter.  But the full extent of his victimization only comes out at the book's surprising conclusion. <br /> <br />With great dialogue, vividly descriptive prose and a fast paced narrative that unfolds smoothly, this novel is a real treat.

Someone in the British Defense Ministry is funneling top secret military information to the Soviet Union.  John Preston, a British intelligence agent of considerable skill, is handed the rather daunting task of finding out who is doing it and why.    Meanwhile, in Moscow, a diabolical plot is being hatched to bring Communist rule to the British Isles using the most nefarious of tactics.    Frederick Forsyth masterfully interweaves these two storylines using a narrative style that is detailed to the nth degree.  The Fourth Protocal is highly suspenseful and filled with unexpected plot twists.  Moreover, Forsyth dares to employ the unusual and somewhat risky technique of using a real life historical figure as one of the main characters....in this case the notorious double agent Kim Philby.    The Fourth Protocol is an extremely engaging, well crafted and meticulously researched cold war thriller that does not disappoint.  It ranks right up there among the genre's finest.	2005-04-24
US	48738119	RYU6W7KQ2IVY3	0553235168	67746697	Trouble Follows Me	Books	3	7	7	N	N	Loose lips sink ships.	This wartime story of murder and betrayal was written by Ross Macdonald early in his literary career.  Before he completely found his voice as a novelist and when he was still known by his given name of Kenneth Millar.    Ensign Sam Drake, an erstwhile journalist, serves the dual role of narrator and protagonist.  Chapter one finds Sam on shore leave in Hawaii.  It's February, 1945.      As Sam and his fellow naval officers enjoy themselves at a party, one of the female party attendees is found dead.  Is it murder or suicide?  And if it's murder does it have anything to do with matters of national security.  These questions continue to plague Sam as he travels stateside.     In typical Ross Macdonald fashion, the plot takes a very complicated trajectory.  Black white racial discord, the 1937 rape of Nanking, fine nuances of cryptography and the Tiajuana sex trade all have a part to play as the convoluted narrative unfolds.    Fans of Ross Macdonald will certainly want to read this early entry in the Macdonald canon.  The richly descriptive brand of prose the author is famous for can be found in abundance.  But much of the dialogue in Trouble Follows Me is stilted and generally lacks the zing found in many of the later Lew Archer mysteries.  Moreover, there is too much reliance on coincidence to suit me.    Suffice it to say that Trouble Follows Me is an easy, interesting read that fails to satisfy in the way that Macdonald's later novels do.  But the hint of greatness soon to come is there.	2005-04-15

The Hot Spot is narrated by Harry Madox a rootless drifter who arrives in town one steamy summer day.  He takes a job as a used car salesman.  But why go to the trouble of working for a living when the town's bank is so poorly guarded? <br /> <br />You see, Harry is not above stealing and he's not above having an affair with his boss' tramp of a wife. But when he falls in love with an innocent young girl he makes himself vulnerable and sets himself up for a precipitous descent into a world of inescapable torment. <br /> <br />The Hot Spot is a well plotted, engaging tale that has a very smooth narrative flow.  Charles Williams has written this novel using a style of prose that is richly detailed and remarkably descriptive.  And he unashamedly structures the story around a main character who is largely unsympathetic. Harry Madox is a thief and what one would generally refer to as a lowlife.  Ironically, it is the one decent aspect of his persona, his genuine love for another human being that does him in. <br /> <br />This is a powerful and moving book that is hard to put down.

The lion's share of the narrative of this superbly crafted mystery unfolds in Washington, D.C., circa early 1970s. Deke Lucas makes his living by uncovering waste, fraud and abuse for various governmental agencies.  And he's very good at what he does.  So good in fact that Frank Size, a syndicated columnist of considerable reknown, lures him away from his latest governmental post to investigate a very intriguing news story.    It seems that one of the U.S. Senate's rising stars, an Indiana Democrat named Robert Ames has abruptly resigned his office amid rumors of his having taken a $50,000 bribe.  Since Ames and his wife are millionaires many times over, the incident makes little sense. Moreover, the ex-Senator seems to have fallen completely under the control of a sexy young woman named Connie Mizelle.    As Deke Lucas attempts to get to the root of what has befallen Robert Ames, a number of deliciously interesting complications are revealed.  Written with abundant wit, this fast paced, action packed story is filled with unexpected twists and delightful surprises.    If You Can't be Good is a great example of Ross Thomas at his best.

The unlikely protagonist in The Horse Latitudes is a former drug dealer by the name of Danny DiMedici.  Danny is an avid swimmer and, curiously, is also an authority on the civilization of the ancient Mayans.  His smart, stunningly beautiful wife, Lauren, has left him and he has yet to get over the hurt he feels.  But now he learns that Lauren has gone missing and her stylish beachfront home is a grisly crime scene. As Danny wends his way through Southern California's not so hidden subculture of drugs and sex, searching for Lauren, the narrative takes on a surreal, otherwordly quality. And author Robert Ferrigno's frequent use of flashback sequences serves to enhance the surrealism.   Add in a mad scientist searching for the fountain of youth and a matched pair of pea brained, muscle bound hitmen and you have a novel which is genuinely bizarre.  Ferrigno's writing is quite skillful at times.  I particularly liked the supporting characters, Karl Steiner and Jane Holt, the odd couple detective team assigned to the case.  But ultimately, I found myself less than fully satisfied because of the way the plot unfolded.  The storyline resolves itself in the latter third of the book in a lame and seemingly random fashion.  The Horse Latitudes is an interesting and, at times, engaging work of fiction.  But the disappointing, unsatisfying ending spoiled it for me.	2005-03-30

Ricky has somehow managed to win hundreds of thousands of dollars in one fast and furious night of gambling at the tables of a Las Vegas casino known as the Mint.  No one comes by that kind of luck honestly.

Consequently, there is never a dull moment in the entire book. <br />Mr. Lucky is a hugely entertaining novel. The explosive first chapter grabs you by the throat and after that there's plenty of page turning action to keep you interested.  Read this book.  You will enjoy the experience. <br />	2005-03-20

Instead, a very conscientious lawyer by the name of Bill Gunnarson serves the dual role of narrator and crime solver. <br />What starts out as a rather mundane case involving serial burglaries becomes increasingly complex and engaging as murder and kidnapping are added into the mix. <br />As in all Ross Macdonald novels, The Ferguson Affair is steeped in human tragedy stemming from the effects of ill-fated relationships and family dysfunction years in the making.  Macdonald's grand theme seems to be that the past will dictate the future and that an individual's ability to alter his pre-determined destiny is extremely limited. <br />The Ferguson Affair gets 5 stars from me because of its intricately constructed and engaging plot, its highly descriptive and imaginative prose and its very compelling and moving character sketches. <br />Ross Macdonald took his craft quite seriously and the results of that are apparent in the pages of this remarkable book. Do yourself a favor and read it.	2005-03-16

As he did to magnificent effect a few years earlier in The Criminal, Jim Thompson utilizes the unusual technique of multiple character first person narration in The Kill-Off.  This fascinating book consists of 12 chapters and each chapter is narrated by a different individual.  The Kill-Off's considerable strength lies in Thompson's remarkable ability to reveal each narrator's internal life using realistic dialogue and vivid introspection.  Thompson is not satisfied in just demonstrating these characters' superficial warts and blemishes.  No, Thompson goes far beyond just that.  He skillfully reveals the gaping wounds in the psyches of his characters so as to allow the reader an unobstructed view into their claustrophobic and often hideous lives.  The novel's plot revolves around the death of a town's resident busybody.  Of course the purpose of plot in a book such as this is merely to serve as a lattice on which the various character sketches can be hung.  Consequently the danger is that too much plot will get in the way.  And that's what makes The Kill-Off only a very good novel as compared to The Criminal which is a great novel.  The plot of The Criminal is an extremely rudimentary one. This has the advantage of allowing the reader to get to know the characters without worrying too much about the plausibility of specific events and plot devices.  The plot of the Kill-Off is a somewhat more complicated one and as such diverts the reader's attention from the book's main strength, its wonderfully and richly drawn cast of characters.    Jim Thompson's unique ability to brazenly and unapologetically reveal the ugly side of human existence is very much at work in this little known and underappreciated book.  Well worth reading.	2005-03-10

There's one unusual thing about Billy. Prior to joining the force, he studied philosophy at the graduate level.  That background gives him an interesting introspective voice that is put to good use in relating the book's unfolding narrative. <br />Guilt ridden and depressed over the imminent move of his ex-wife and beloved daughter out of state, Billy is beginning to exhibit behavioral changes.  He no longer sleeps very much and he foolishly takes risks, some of which could be interpreted as suicidal. <br />Called upon to investigate the murder of Mae Richards, the mother of one of LA's most notorious drug kingpins, Billy recklessly decides to use his position to pursue agendas at odds with his sworn duty to uphold the law.  As a result, some very disasterous consequences develope. <br />With a number of interrelated subplots, including one about a Hollywood celebrity suspected of having killed his wife, Murder Book succeeds in grabbing onto and holding reader interest.  Moreover, there are plenty of surprise plot twists and well crafted action sequences that add to the novel's substantial appeal. <br />This is an intelligently written crime novel which dares to feature a protagonist who, though very articulate and insightful, is a seriously flawed human being.

Missionary Stew by Ross Thomas is a wickedly irreverent satiric novel that is both fast paced and hilarious.  There are two main characters, Draper Haere and Morgan Citron.  Haere makes his living in the world of politics.  He's not a politician himself.  Rather he operates behind the scenes to advance the agendas of politicians he works for.  Morgan Citron is an investigative reporter who has been traumatized by a rather unpleasant 13 month stay in an African jail and is conflicted about returning to work.  An incident of some sort has ocurred in a Central American country.  The details of this incident are sketchy, but it seems that whenever someone learns what has happened, that person winds up dead.    Haere's current client is Baldwin Veatch, the governor-elect of California and a presidential hopeful.  Haere has reason to believe that the incident being covered up constitutes an embarassing scandal for the sitting President.  Therefore, if he can expose the secret, his client's chances of becoming President will be greatly enhanced. So, Haere hires Citron to use his investigative skills to unravel the mystery.  The plot of Missionary Stew is exceedingly complex.  As the narrative advances, the reader learns of all manner of complications.  Playing key roles are: a redneck Floridian drug runner, the CEO of a National Inquirer type tabloid who happens to be Citron's own mother, a corrupt Central American general, as well as various and sundry members and ex-members of the intelligence community.  Suffice it to say that the book's characters are all very interesting and delightfully eccentric.  Moreover, the dialogue is quite snappy and has an understated wit about it that is genuinely entertaining.  If you like your political novels to have byzantine plots, quirky characters, clever dialogue and cynical points of view, by all means read this book.  You'll love it.	2005-02-14

It's a gangster tale told by a gangster.  And not just any gangster at that.  Ralph Cotter is evil incarnate.  He's an amoral criminal who kills in cold blood.  But unlike most other murdering thugs, Cotter is a cultured, educated man.  His Phi Beta Kappa key is probably the last thing he ever came by honestly. To make everyone aware of his intellectual superiority, he freely uses five dollar vocabulary words and regularly makes obscure references to the classics.  Following a harrowing escape from a prison work farm, Cotter shacks up with a slutty gun moll named Holiday.  It doesn't take him long to find corrupt police officials he can blackmail into doing his bidding.  And his charming demeanor allows him to become romantically involved with the obscenely wealthy daughter of an ex-governor.  Is the plot of Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye a believable one?  Of course not. I doubt it was meant to be.  This is an allegorical novel. A fairy tale for adults, if you will.  The novel's strength lies in its ability to convey certain truths about human fallability through the very detailed and astute introspection of the repugnant but fascinating narrator.  Both Cotter and the book itself have an overpowering audacity that makes for very compelling reading.  Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye is an original work of crime fiction that embraces the noir tradition and takes it to a whole new level.  Highly recommended.	2005-02-10

Together with his friend Ronnie, he owns a low rent construction outfit.  Plus he has a beautiful and smart fiancee named Nancy Cuellar.  When Marissa Hardin, a wealthy customer's wife, is brutally murdered, Lackey becomes the police's prime suspect. This despite the fact the physical evidence indicates he didn't do it.  Meanwhile the real perpetrator, a severely disturbed ex-con, is left free to continue his murderous ways.    Prime Suspect is a well constructed novel about a man's victimization as a result of circumstances beyond his control.  Author A.W. Gray has infused this book with a healthy amount of ironic, sometimes dark humor and the looming presence of the sadistic killer establishes a palpable sense of menace.  The characters are realistically drawn and the plentiful dialogue is both believable and engaging.    I found this book to be an interesting read.  Its strongest feature is the richly drawn cast of characters.	2005-02-07

Ross Macdonald is best known as author of the Lew Archer series of hardboiled detective novels.  But he also wrote a few Lew Archer short stories. The Name is Archer consists of 7 of these stories. <br />The writing in all 7 stories is first rate.  Each of the narratives flows along smoothly.  Macdonald consistently uses a very descriptive brand of prose that quite effectively brings  the reader vivid images of what is happening as Lew Archer tackles the very worst of what humanity chooses to dish out.  Ever the cynic, Archer delivers some very funny wisecracks, a number of which are priceless. <br />As for the plots of the individual stories.... well suffice it to say that some are better than others. One of the best is story #3, The Bearded Lady.  In it, Macdonald covers many of the themes that can also be found in his novels.  These include: jealousy, greed, betrayal, infidelity and the consequences of having an inadequate father figure. <br /> <br />Any fan of hardboiled crime fiction will undoubtedly derive enjoyment from reading this book. <br />	2005-02-03

As an investigative reporter who is not shy about getting involved in the uglier side of life, Quinn, the protagonist of Dead Man's Dance, is no stranger to humanity's dark underbelly.  But when he has to investigate the brutal murder of his own stepfather, his protective veneer of professionalism and objectivity is entirely stripped away. <br />Dead Man's Dance is a well crafted murder mystery populated with a host of interesting characters.  Readers know from the onset of the narrative that the killers are two frighteningly creepy hired guns named Hugo and Rick.  The novel's mystery therefore revolves around the identity and the motivation of the person who has paid them to kill. <br />As Quinn pushes forward in his search for the truth he becomes aware that events occuring 3 decades in the past, some of which involve him personally, have led to his stepfather's killing. <br />Robert Ferrigno is a very talented novelist.  The story is nicely paced and quite engaging.  And the characters are well fleshed out and interesting.  I look forward to reading other books by this same author.	2005-01-30

Hack Bohannon quit his job as deputy sheriff after 14 years on the force.  Now he makes ends meet by boarding other people's horses on his ranch.  But whenever there's a mystery to be solved Hack reluctantly pulls out his private investigator's license and returns to police work.  Bohannon's Book consists of 5 previously published mysteries, all of which feature Hack Bohannon.  Rugged, taciturn and all business, Bohannon posesses deductive skills that are almost Holmesian.  All of the stories take place in the vicinity of Hack's ranch on California's central coast.  Author Joseph Hansen consistently uses a very descriptive brand of prose which quite effectively lends realism to the people and places he writes about.  And Hack Bohannon is a literary creation with considerable appeal.  Of the stories in this book, the first one, Tango Bear, was my least favorite.  The ending spoiled it for me because it did not fit with the rest of the narrative.  The other 4 stories were significantly more satisfying. I found Snipe Hunt, Witch's Broom, Merely Players and Death of an Otter to be well crafted, engaging whodunits with narratives that unfold against a very believable backdrop.	2005-01-22
US	48738119	R3FVE4QDCY47TC	0884961699	345115518	Self-Portrait: Ceaselessly into the Past	Books	4	14	14	N	N	An author's introspection.	This slim volume is comprised of 21 short nonfiction offerings from Ross Macdonald, with the overwhelming majority dating from the 15 years between 1964 and 1979.  One is a transcript of an interview given by Macdonald.  The remaining 20 are essays that were written as magazine articles, book forewords and the like.  Because this is a collection of individual works written over a number of years there is a certain amount of repetition and redundancy.    Three essays are devoted to one of Macdonald's lifelong passions, ecologic conservation.  The rest of the book, however, is devoted to writers and writing.  The topics addressed include: the history of the American crime novel starting with Poe, the function crime fiction fulfills to society, the author's relationship to his best known character Lew Archer, an analysis of Hammett's Sam Spade as he appears in the Maltese Falcon and the critical importance of narrative unity in crime novels.  It is on the latter point that Macdonald found himself at odds with Raymond Chandler.    But by far the most compelling theme to be found in this book is the profound relationship between Macdonald's early biography and the fiction he created.    When Macdonald was 4 years old, his parents separated.  He rarely saw his father after that.  And, perhaps even more disturbingly, he went on to spend his formative years being shuttled like a hot potato from the household of one relative to that of another.  This horrid childhood took quite a psychological toll on the young Ross Macdonald, who was then known as Kenneth Millar.  It is therefore no coincidence that so much of Macdonald's fiction revolves around dysfunctional families and absent or inadequate fathers. And Macdonald in Self-Portrait: Ceaselessly into the Past spells this out in no uncertain terms.  He freely admits that his books are, in the final analysis, a means for him to work through the lingering effect of his unhappy early years.    How sad it is to realize that the many entertaining stories Ross Macdonald brought to an appreciative readership were in fact born as a result of the torment experienced by a lonely, traumatized child.	2005-01-16

The Cold War Swap is the very first of an impressive number of novels written by the legendary Ross Thomas.  In it, the recurring characters Mac McCorkle and Mike Padillo are introduced. <br /> <br />McCorkle runs an American style bar and grill in Bonn, West Germany.  Padillo, his friend and partner is a covert agent for an ultra-clandestine U.S. intelligence agency.  Over the years, Padillo has frequently been called upon to carry out some very dangerous missions on behalf of the agency he works for.  On most occasions, McCorkle remains in Bonn covering for his friend while asking no questions.  But this time McCorkle gets involved in Padillo's undercover world and does so in a big way. <br /> <br />The Cold War Swap is a tongue-in-cheek send-up of the espionage genre.  With plotting that is somewhat less than airtight, Thomas gives us a rather complex tale of cold war intrigue where double crossing is a hazard encountered with frightening frequency. <br /> <br />Told as a first person narrative from McCorkle's perspective, The Cold War Swap just brims with the urbane brand of humor Ross Thomas novels are famous for.  An entertaining read, witty and fast paced.	2005-01-08
US	48738119	R2RYGT6QVERZDI	0030574862	889886395	Fadeout	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Impressive.	Joseph Hansen manages to fit a remarkable amount of storytelling in this relatively short novel.  Fadeout is the story of an intriguing investigation.  Yet it is so much more than that.  Seemingly without effort, Hansen also succeeds in giving the reader a very revealing look into the inner life of the investigator.    Fox Olson of Pima, California has disappeared and is presumed dead.  Mr. Olson is many things.  Husband, father, local radio personality, writer, painter and erstwhile politician. He also owns a $150,000 insurance policy from a company known as Medallion Life.  Dave Brandstetter is a claims investigator for Medallion Life and it is his job to find out what really has happened to Fox Olson. As Brandstetter interviews the policyholder's family and acquaintances he learns that things are not as they appear.  The ostensibly happy life Fox Olson seemed to be enjoying was anything but that.      All is not well with Dave Brandstetter either.  You see, Dave is a homosexual and his life partner of more than 20 years has recently died of cancer.  Dave is just now trying to learn how to live again.  In giving us the Dave Brandstetter character, Hansen has done a very remarkable thing, at least as far as detective fiction is concerned.  Though proudly gay, there is nothing about Dave that would lead anyone meeting him in a professional setting to suspect he is anything other than heterosexual.  His speech, his clothes, his mannerisms, everything about him speaks to a mainstream orientation.  But since the reader is aware of Dave's homosexuality, the way in which Hansen has him relate to women, other gays and homophobic individuals he encounters in the course of his work is quite interesting indeed.  Moreover, Hansen includes a number of scenes between Dave and the people in his own life which very tellingly expose the pain and anguish he carries within.      One cannot help but notice the similarities of Hansen's writing style in Fadeout to much of the work of Ross Macdonald.  Both writers use a highly descriptive type of prose that is very effective.  Both delight in exploring the geographic and sociologic diversity California has to offer.  Both make use of long held family secrets to provide key plot twists.  And both feature toughminded protagonists who steadfastly seek out the truth.    Fadeout is truly an impressive literary effort. Word for word, this book delivers as much value to the reader as any work of fiction out there.	2004-12-30
US	48738119	RNKL8KEUHZ3CK	188594151X	28764778	Strangers in Town : Three Newly Discovered Mysteries	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A Ross Macdonald sampler.	Strangers in Town contains 3 previously unpublished detective stories by Ross Macdonald.  Story #2, which is also entitled Strangers in Town, and story #3, The Angry Man, both star Lew Archer, the fictional PI most identified with Macdonald. Story #1, Death by Water, on the other hand features an investigator named Joe Rogers.  The introduction, written by editor Tom Nolan consists largely of biographical facts about Macdonald with special emphasis on his time spent in the Navy during and just after WWII.    Death by Water (1945) is a very well written, cogent, straightforward murder mystery...with nothing hardboiled about it.  A perplexing death is explained using a certain forensic finding.  I was able to spot this critically important clue a mile away because I had read The Blue Hammer just a couple of weeks before.  And it so happens that the same forensic finding appears in that 1976 Lew Archer novel as well.  (Not to mention the fact that the writers of CSI Miami had latched onto the same gimmick and made it their own in a recent TV episode.)  In any event, for what it is, Death by Water is first rate.    Stangers in Town (1950), in contrast, very much belongs to the hardboiled genre.  In it, Lew Archer works to exonerate an African-American youth accused of a brutal murder.  Archer's investigation brings him into contact with organized crime members and some other interestingly shady characters. The plot is a bit contrived, but overall, Stangers in Town is an engaging read.    The eventful narrative of The Angry Man (1955) unfolds over just a very few hours time and addresses themes and subject matter Ross Macdonald is famous for having specialized in.  Namely, dysfunctional families with long held secrets, seductive females, all consuming jealousy and greed intense enough to kill for.  Vintage terrain for both Lew Archer and Ross Macdonald.    Overall, this book rates 4 stars.  Worthwhile reading for all Ross Macdonald fans.	2004-12-29

When one of his lowlife clients, a drug pusher named Sonny Starr, is murdered, Bino suddenly finds himself at the center of a major federal investigation.  This entertaining novel is populated by a number of colorful characters.  Besides Bino himself, there's Karen Allen a sexy FBI agent, two ruthless redneck criminals named John-boy and Buster, a bookie known as Half-a-Point Harrison and many more.  But author A.W. Gray is at his best writing action scenes.  Particularly well done is a segment describing a store robbery as it horrifyingly unfolds.  Bino is a quirky, irreverent book that does for the city of Dallas what Elmore Leonard's fiction has done for Detroit.	2004-12-29

In this skillfully written tale of murder and intrigue, Ross MacDonald manages to \\"out Chandler\\" Raymond Chandler.  It's Southern California, circa 1950, and hardboiled detective Lew Archer finds himself traversing the same landscapes Chandler's Philip Marlowe does in The Big Sleep, High Window and The Long Goodbye. <br />The plot of The Drowning Pool is complex enough to be interesting without being convoluted or forced.  Greed, blackmail, homosexuality and family dysfunction all play roles in advancing the nicely paced narrative.  Thrown in for good measure are seductive women, a number of action scenes and a Lolita like teenager named Cathy. <br />MacDonald's very descriptive prose is quite effective.  And there's plenty of memorable dialogue.  My personal favorite: \\"Your reminiscences fascinate me. May I take notes?\\" <br />You'd be hard pressed to find a more satisfying example of noir crime writing.  An enthusiastic 5 stars.	2004-12-17

Most of us would probably think of that as a pretty nifty way to make a living.  However, Mike has a less enthusiastic take on the subject, describing his job as \\"Better than laying linoleum. But just.\\" <br />As the narrative to Shooting Script begins we learn that Mike is a bit depressed, primarily because of his relatively recent, painful divorce.  But his life is beginning to change for the better.  You see, he has just sold a two hour cop show pilot to one of the networks and stands to make a considerable sum of money as a result. <br />Unfortunately, there's a fly in the ointment.  Fellow New Yorker, Nicholas Stavros claims that he is the true originator of the idea behind the pilot and is threatening to sue Saldinger for plagiarism. So when Stavros winds up murdered, the police naturally think Mike has something to do with it. <br />Gordon Cotler has done a wonderful job in creating this delightful novel.  The characters are hilariously drawn and there's plenty of Hollywood insider humor.  But the best thing about Shooting Script is the seamless way the narrative unfolds.  Cotler advances the story very skillfully.  There are many interesting situations but none are gratuitously thrown in.  Rather, each plays a key role in the construction of the book's interesting and suspenseful plot. <br />This novel should be required reading for all would be mystery writers.  It's a textbook for how to smoothly relate a story while maximizing reader interest.  Highly recommended.	2004-12-13

The coastal town of Santa Teresa, California and the isolated desert community of Copper City, Arizona.  Chapter 1 finds veteran private eye Lew Archer at the Santa Teresa home of copper magnate Jack Biemeyer and his wife Ruth.  He's been hired to locate a potentially valuable painting that is missing from their residence.  It doesn't take long for Archer to establish that the Biemeyer's flower child daughter, Doris, and her art student boyfriend, Fred Johnson, have something to do with the painting's disappearance.  But the case takes a much more serious turn when, later that same night, the art dealer who originally sold the painting to Ruth Biemeyer is bludgeoned to death.  This intricately plotted mystery is less a story about stolen artwork or even murder than it is a study of family secrets reaching back over more than a generation.  Lost love, jealousy, dysfunctional relationships, homosexuality and substance abuse all play a part in the interesting narrative that unfolds in the pages of this novel.  And the ending is a really great one.  Well constructed and compelling, The Blue Hammer is first rate storytelling.  Well worth reading.	2004-12-07

Early on in this intriguing but stylistically odd book, a British cabinet officer known only as \\"our man\\" stabs a woman to death.  Harry Fielding witnesses this act and has the presence of mind to photograph it as it occurs.  Harry is what is known as an understrapper.  That's a colloquialism for a small time crook who supplements his income by hiring himself out to the British intelligence service.  The novel's narration is provided by Harry himself and consists largely of short,choppy sentences that betray no emotion.  The storyline is both interesting and engaging for approximately the first half of the book.  Then any semblance of narrative coherence all but disappears.  A series of subplots are introduced and individually showcased in a way that makes the book excessively disjointed.  A chapter in which Harry finds himself driving a truck in war torn Bosnia seems particularly out of place.  Davison's writing style is too clever for its own good because it keeps drawing attention to itself rather than the story it's supposed to tell.  Crooked Man gets a marginal 3 stars from me because the initial plot is a good one.  But, overall, I would not recommend it.	2004-12-01

British engineer Nicholas Marlow accepts a position in the Milan office of a machine tool manufacturing company known as Spartacus. Since Spartacus' products are used in the production of munitions, Marlow has access to information of value to those engaged in espionage. <br />A bit naive, Marlow is rather easily sucked into the cloak and dagger intrigue endemic to that time and place and rather unfortunately incurs the wrath of Mussolini's secret police. <br />Cause for Alarm is an engaging spy novel that has a smooth narrative flow.  Moreover, Ambler's detailed knowledge of his subject matter is quite apparent.  A solid 4 stars for this early contribution to the genre.  Well worth reading.	2004-11-27

While driving from L.A. to Sacramento, ace private eye Lew Archer stumbles upon a city known as Las Cruces where sordid secrets abound. Archer is a card carrying member of the hardboiled school of criminal investigation.  He's a tough customer who can take a beating as well as render one if necessary.   <br />Early in the narrative, a truck driver is murdered.  As Archer seeks to solve this particular crime, he soon learns of a complex web of betrayal and deceit which binds together a number of Las Cruces' citizens. <br />This novel is about the seemier side of life. Illicit sex is a recurring theme, as are greed and jealousy. <br />MacDonald uses a highly descriptive type of prose, much of which is quite artfully written.  And there are several distinct subplots which are all tied together at the story's dramatic conclusion.  Though I found the narrative to be more convoluted than necessary, I have no trouble recommending Find a Victim to anyone who likes their mysteries hardboiled.	2004-11-23

Savage Art is a truly remarkable work of scholarship.  In it, Robert Polito meticulously separates out fact from the considerable amount of mythology that surrounds Jim Thompson's life.  Since so much of what Thompson wrote is autobiographical in origin, a knowledge of Thompson's very unusual life history helps the reader better appreciate his work.  So it is not at all hard to argue that this is not only a well written and fascinating biography, it is an important one as well.  Polito explains, in exacting detail, how Thompson's life and consequently his writing was influenced by the interpersonal and societal forces he encountered as he matured.    To put it another way.  Jim Thompson's worldview was shaped, nurtured and, some would say, warped by his life experiences.  He then took this unique worldview and used it to interpret the self same experiences which formed it. The result is Thompson's very significant contribution to 20th century American fiction.  Dark, disturbing books inhabited by sad, desperate characters trapped in hideous circumstances.  These are novels that boldly explore areas that would otherwise be unexplorable.  Savage Art is very much a monumental achievement.  Essential reading for Jim Thompson fans.	2004-11-17

The narration is provided by the main character Jim Asher.  Jim is a California surfer who has a lot going for him.  He's young, good looking, charming and of above average intelligence.  One day, Jim decides he'd like to get involved in Republican politics.  So he presents himself to the campaign headquarters of Edward Winston, a Michael Huffingtonesque candidate for U.S. Senate.  Owing to a fair amount of luck and a brashness even he didn't know he had, Jim rapidly becomes a mover and shaker in the rough and tumble world of California state politics.  Seduced by the sex, money and power his new found career provides him, Jim does some unethical and completely illegal things to put himself at the top of the political heap.  Thereby setting himself and his allies up for a precipitous fall.  This book has much to recommend it.  It's filled with humor and has a smooth narrative flow.  The outrageousness of modern campaign tactics and political maneuvering are captured quite well.  Sure, some of the situations described are a bit over the top.  But it could also be argued that there are other places where author Tom Lowe did not go far enough in lampooning his subject matter.  Spin is an engaging novel that presents a laugh inducing insider's view of what politics and politicians have all too sadly become.	2004-11-17

Bukowski rather coarsely but fairly convincingly puts the lie to the conventional wisdom that honest work is an enobling experience.   <br />In Post Office, Henry Chinaski reluctantly accepts employment first as a letter carrier and later as a postal clerk.  You see, Henry has three expensive hobbies: drinking, fornicating and visiting racetracks.  Without the steady income the post office provides, he would not be able to maintain his chosen lifestyle.  So he compromises his principles and becomes a working stiff. <br />Using a number of illustrative vignettes, Bukowski brings to life the mind numbing drudgery and utter humiliation that comes part and parcel with many, if not most, jobs.  For so many people, work is a trap, a collosal burden that saps their humanity.  And this book does a beautiful job of showing just that. <br />There's also plenty of funny, irreverent material about the women in Henry's life.  Some of whom he rather flippantly refers to as shack jobs. <br />Post Office is politically incorrect, vulgar and frequently offensive.  But it is genuinely funny and a lot of truth can be found in its pages.    <br />	2004-11-11

If I had to summarize Dying to Meet You in one sentence, I'd have to say it's a case study of one man's descent into madness.  Lowell Marshall was an acclaimed concert pianist.  But tragically, arthritis has crippled his hands and he can no longer play. Now, at age thirty-five, he has no prospects for suitable employment.  What's more, his marriage is rapidly deteriorating.   Lowell decides to seek solitude in a country cottage.  A dank, dismal place with no electricity or running water.  There he finds an old photograph.  Taken well over one hundred years before, it's a portrait of an attractive young woman.  Lowell becomes enchanted with this mystery woman from long ago and his mood immediately improves.  Soon thereafter, he meets Rose Ballater, a seventeen year old girl who lives on the farm next door.  She bears an uncanny resemblance to the young woman in the picture and Lowell becomes convinced he and Rose are soulmates.  Dying to Meet You is an engaging tale with a narrative that unfolds smoothly.

In it, Carl Hiaasen skillfully interweaves several plot threads each riotously funny in its own right. <br />With a hurricane ravaged Miami as backdrop, the author uses a large cast of colorfully bizarre characters to expertly lampoon life in South Florida. <br />Found among the many subplots are the following: <br />While on his honeymoon, New York ad man Max Lamb is abducted.  Not by space aliens but by a scary hermit called Skink, who happens to be a former Florida governor.   <br />As she searches for her missing husband, Bonnie, Max's bride, meets and becomes attracted to Augustine Herrera.  Augustine is one of the book's more normal characters.  That is if you overlook the fact he enjoys juggling human skulls for relaxation. <br />Two hapless con artists named Edie and Snapper take up residence in a stranger's hurricane damaged house with plans to collect the sizable insurance payoff. <br />A corrupt building inspector named Avila is a devoted follower of Chango, a santeria god who seems to require increasingly exotic species of animals for sacrifice. <br />And there's much, much more. <br />Stormy Weather is great satire.  Filled with the most outrageous dark humor imaginable, it just drips with cynicism.  Another outstanding comic novel from the warped but nimble mind of Carl Hiaasen.	2004-11-06

Acting on an impulse, one of them, Andrew Neville, inexplicably stabs the other to death. After commiting this horrendous act, Neville feels no remorse whatsoever.  Remarkably enough, he then proceeds to take for himself everything the dead man had possessed.  His beautiful wife, his child, his home and even his career. <br />The story is told from the point of view of the killer, making it that much more horrifying.  Added in for good measure are a grubby private eye and a frighteningly creepy groundskeeper.  <br />Author Ron Faust makes good use of an elegant brand of prose that works quite well.  Particularly when it comes to describing nature and outdoor scenes in general. <br />Split Image is a daringly different type of book.  Disturbing and captivating at the same time, it makes for a great reading experience.	2004-10-28

This Boston based novel is a straightforward whodunit that is well written, cleverly plotted and easy to read. The narration is provided by attorney Brady Coyne.  An important client of his, Judge Chester Popowski has been threatened with blackmail.  When the blackmailer is murdered, Coyne finds himself high up on the police's list of suspects. <br />Author William Tapply is obviously a keen observer of human behavior.  The characters in Client Privilege are depicted in a realistic fashion, complete with flaws and frailities. Moreover, the plentiful dialogue rings quite true. <br />Client Privilege is an enjoyable murder mystery written with lots of insight into the human condition. A solid 4 stars.	2004-10-24

Meet Me at the Morgue takes place in Pacific Point, California, a seaside town just south of Los Angeles.  Four year old Jamie Johnson, the son of one of the community's richest men, has been kidnapped.  The ransom is $50,000.  Howard Cross is the narrator of this well written novel.  He's a local County Probation Officer who suddenly finds himself at the center of the investigation.  This book has much to recommend it.  As an investigator, Cross is most definitely hard-boiled.  But MacDonald wisely keeps Cross' tough guy persona in check so as to make him a more likeable protaganist.  The narrative is compelling and flows quite smoothly.  Believable dialogue and great descriptive passages both add to the novel's substantial appeal.  Meet Me at the Morgue has only one flaw.  And that's what prevents me from giving it 5 stars.  One of the crime's perpetrators, a man named Art Lemp, is inexplicably tied in to a completely unrelated subplot.  This, unfortunately, constitutes too much of a coincidence and thereby detracts from the story's otherwise masterful construction.  But, all in all, I'd have to say Meet Me at the Morgue is a prime example of crime fiction as it was meant to be.  Highly recommended.	2004-10-22

The Porkchoppers by Ross Thomas is a very well plotted and cleverly written novel about the labor union movement.    Sixty-two year old Don Cubbin is the national president of a large, unnamed union.  Election time is drawing near.  And his opponent is the much younger Sammy Hanks, Don's former protege.  Both men have serious flaws.  Don is an alcoholic and Sammy has a tendency to fly into uncontrollable temper tantrums at the most inopportune times.  Each candidate has an election team that wants its man to win no matter what the cost. And there are some very powerful outside forces that seek to influence the election outcome.  The Porkchoppers is teeming with a large number of interesting supporting characters. Like Truman Goff, a produce manager at Safeway who moonlights as a paid assassin - to name just one.  Written with abundant wit, this novel gives the reader an eye opening insight into the rather dicey world of labor union politics.    I found The Porkchoppers to be a highly entertaining work of fiction. Read it, you'll be glad you did.	2004-10-16
US	48738119	RFBW6HMUFGRZG	0345470265	952096959	Bad Blood	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Cluttered.	As risk manager for a very busy Denver hospital, Vicky Lucci has an extremely hectic work schedule under normal circumstances.  But lately, Vicky's job has gotten even more complicated.  You see, several patients have recently been transfused with the wrong blood and it's unlikely the cause is merely accidental.  First let me say what's good about this book.  The Vicky Lucci character is very thoroughly fleshed out.  The reader gets to learn quite a bit about her from the things she does and from the extensive amount of introspection the author has written for her.  She comes off as a believable human being complete with a number of imperfections.  Now for what is not so good about this book.  First of all there are way too many characters.  Some are introduced, never to be heard from again.  And a number of Vicky's fellow hospital employees are impossible to differentiate from others with similar jobs.  Moreover, the narrative is cluttered with too many subplots, most of which are never satisfactorily resolved.  Vicky eventually finds out who is responsible for the mismatched blood but only after a frustratingly prolonged sequence of largely unrelated events.  My overall impression is that Bad Blood would have benefited from tighter editing.  A more streamlined version would have been better.	2004-10-07

The year is 1986, the place Washington, D.C.  Sixty year old counterterrorism expert Booth Stallings is hired by persons unknown to deliver a $5 million bribe to a troublesome Filipino rebel leader. <br />But Stallings does not see himself as a mere delivery boy.  He'd much rather get his hands permanently on the 5 million.  Knowing he'll need some help and after consulting with his lawyer son-in-law, he takes on as partners Artie Wu and Quincy Durant.  Two lifelong friends who know their way around both the Far East and other people's money. <br />By the time he gets to Manila, Stallings finds that he has four partners, not two.  You see, a con man named Otherguy Overby and an ex-Secret Service agent named Georgia Blue have cleverly insinuated themselves into the mix. <br />Out on the Rim is an entertaining and complex tale of intrigue.  There's plenty of double crossing and lots of unexpected alliances turn up.  In fact, about two thirds of the way through, the complications start to get a bit out of hand.  And that is the book's main flaw. <br />Written with wit and urbane humor, Out on the Rim is deliciously engaging.  But the number of twists and turns could have been 50% less without detracting at all from the fun.	2004-09-25

This short book is a collection of essays which explores the phenomenon of original paperback novels, with special attention paid to the lives and works of the three writers mentioned in the title.  James Sallis explains how each author's individual demons influenced his writing.  And he demonstrates how each of the three used the medium of pulp fiction to create novels which shatter the reader's preconceived notions of reality while unapologetically exposing the ugly side of human existence.

In this the 4th installment of the Tony Valentine series, James Swain expands his horizons by incorporating subject matter related to international terrorism.  A wise move.  Because, let's face it, after a while the different ways of cheating at cards begin to sound very much alike to readers not intimately familiar with the gaming life. <br />Loaded Dice takes place in Las Vegas, the site of the first Tony Valentine novel, Grift Sense.  And some of the same colorful, interesting characters introduced in that book reappear. <br />There are a number of engaging subplots which simultaneously unfold over a very short period of time.  Tony uses his brains, brawn, agility, computer skills and marksmanship to save the day on several occasions.  Not bad for a guy who, in one more year, will be eligible for Medicare. <br />This is a very entertaining, tightly written novel.  And like Swain's 3 other Tony Valentine books, it is extremely readable.	2004-09-17

He becomes convinced that if he leaves his voluptuous tramp of a wife, Mildred, and takes up with the waif-like, angelic Doris, he will at long last be able to escape his hellish existence. But he soon discovers that redemption is not that simple. <br />Cassidy's Girl is about the dark, depressing lives of a group of alcoholics inhabiting a rundown neighborhood bordering the Philadelphia waterfront.  It is a no holds barred study of people whose lives are simultaneously fueled and poisoned by alcohol.  Goodis describes how this community, of sorts, functions.  Acts of friendship alternate with acts of violence.  Love and affection coexist side by side with hate and betrayal. <br />Goodis' portrayal of the frustratingly hopeless environment in which the characters find themselves is vivid and expertly drawn. The plot, however, is not as compelling as it might have been.  Instead of flowing smoothly, the narrative has a herky-jerky quality with events occurring seemingly at random. That is to say the motivation behind the actions of key characters is many times unclear. <br />Cassidy's plan to rescue Doris and himself is, as you would expect, eventually ruined.  But the cause of this ruination is not just fate or inevitability.  Cassidy himself makes conscious choices which directly lead to his own defeat. <br />Cassidy's Girl is classic noir.  Unapologetically downbeat, it fearlessly explores the ugly, hopeless side of life. Proceed at your own risk.	2004-09-06
US	48738119	R3G7APUSNPMLIZ	0679740147	618493179	Heed the Thunder	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Exceeds expectations.	Heed the Thunder takes place in rural Nebraska over a period of several years starting somewhere around 1910.  Civil War veteran Lincoln Fargo presides over his extended family with the help of his God fearing wife, Pearl.  As the story begins, their daughter Edie Dillon and her young son Robert arrive from Oklahoma to live with them.  It seems that Edie's husband has deserted her and Robert, leaving the two of them in dire financial straits.  Readers familiar with Thompson's early life will recognize the autobiographical underpinnings of this book.  Young Robert Dillon is a stand-in for the author and Edie is a dead ringer for Thompson's mother, Birdie.<br /><br />First published in 1946, Heed the Thunder predates the many dark, disturbing, noirish paperbacks that would secure Jim Thompson his status as a cult hero.  Because it is billed as \\"perhaps the most mainstream of Thompson's novels\\", I was expecting it to lack the tough edginess one usually associates with Thompson's work.  I was wrong.  Here are just three of the many examples of brutality and depravity to be found in this book:<br /><br />A dishonest preacher is unceremoniously tarred and feathered.<br /><br />A misbehaving schoolboy receives a harsh beating and is permanently disfigured.<br /><br />There's an incestuous affair between cousins.  As shocking then as it would be now.<br /><br />Heed the Thunder has a large cast of very interesting and richly drawn characters and several intriguing subplots that unfold as the narrative progresses.  There is much humor of the kind that will remind readers of Mark Twain.  Like when an impoverished lawyer makes a name for himself by bringing a lawsuit against God.  And there's plenty of social criticism, especially when it comes to the subject of inhumane working conditions.<br /><br />In fact, there's so much material here, Thompson could easily have written Heed the Thunder as a 600+ page epic. Instead, he wisely opted to keep the length down to half that.<br/><br />This novel gives an intriguing account of life on the plains of Nebraska in the early years of the 20th century.  The hardscrabble lives lived by most of the characters are presented in an unvarnished manner.  The humiliating poverty, the appalling ignorance and the inescapable cruelty which pervaded everyday existence are all unapologetically exposed.  All in all, this is an intriguing and substantive book which forshadows the frighteningly disturbing, brutally stark type of novel which would soon become Jim Thompson's trademark.	2004-09-05
US	48738119	R1IMPTR1GFGO9G	0679733132	631405199	The Alcoholics	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Subpar for Thompson.	The legendary Jim Thompson has a well deserved reputation as a great writer.  Gripping, compelling and unforgettable, a number of his books rank with the very best of 20th century American fiction.  The Alcoholics, I'm sorry to say, is not one of these books. <br />The narrative unfolds over a one day period on the grounds of El Healtho Sanatorium, a rehabilitative facility for alcoholics. <br />The plot itself is rather flimsy, so the book's success or failure rests firmly on the shoulders of its characters and the things they think, say and do. <br />By and large, Thompson has populated The Alcoholics with characters who are way over the top.  Exaggerated caricatures of real life personality types.  There's Dr. Murphy the suicidal psychiatrist, Miss Baker the sadistic RN, Rufus the overly zealous orderly and an assortment of strange alcoholic patients.  Quite frankly, I found only Josephine the uneducated but highly capable cook to be of any interest at all. <br />Thompson's best work can be found in the realm of the noir.  That is to say in those books where he takes real life and mercilessly exposes its hidden, dark underbelly.  When he tries to create surreal characters and settings, as he does here, the end result is far less satisfying.	2004-08-31
US	48738119	R1NZ9BV2MD2O9A	0312960727	74048659	Prime Candidate	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Smoothly written.	Prime Candidate by Gordon Cotler gets 5 stars from me because it delivers what it's supposed to deliver, and then some. <br />The main character and narrator is Jock Caprisi, an ace newspaperman, who has recently become a media consultant.  His client is Mort Beaufoy, the senior senator from New York.  Distinguished and statesmanlike, Beaufoy is obviously modelled after the nonfictitious Daniel Patrick Moynihan. <br />Standing in the way of Beaufoy's re-election to a fourth and final senate term is a primary challenge from sleazy and corrupt Congressman Herb Turnbull.  The aggressive but alluring Ms. Poppy Hancock is Turnbull's campaign manager and a key character in this very well written novel. <br />Prime Candidate begins with just 8 days to go before the primary election. Caprisi's worst nightmare suddenly becomes a reality when the body of an attractive young woman is discovered in the backseat of Beaufoy's car. <br />Using the skill and connections developed during his years as a reporter, Caprisi snaps into action to exonerate his client of any wrong-doing as time rapidly runs out. <br />This book is smartly written and has a very smooth narrative flow.  Moreover, Jock Caprisi is a very appealing character.  A native New Jerseyean, Caprisi is a natural born cynic.  But Cotler wisely does not overdo the cynicism to the point of  making him obnoxious or irritating. <br />Prime Candidate is a first rate murder mystery made all the more interesting because it unfolds in the midst of a hotly contested political race.  It is witty, suspenseful and satisfying.  Read it, you'll be glad you did.  <br />	2004-08-30

But my oh my what a punch it packs.  Fourteen year old Josie Eddleman has been raped and murdered.  The accused is 15 year old Bob Talbert, Josie's schoolmate and neighbor.  Is Bob innocent of the crime?  Probably.  But then again, maybe he isn't. Thompson never completely resolves this question because this book is not a whodunit.  In fact, it is not a conventional novel at all.  Thompson has divided The Criminal into 14 short chapters.  Different characters involved in the case each serve as first person narrators in one or two of these chapters.  There's Bob himself, Bob's father, Bob's mother, the DA, an investigative reporter, the defense attorney, etc.  Thompson very skillfully has each narrator give their own perspective on the case while at the same time providing breathtaking insights into his or her own life.  This book is a real treat.  Page after page contains great dialogue and vivid introspection.  Seemingly without effort, Thompson addresses a wide variety of interesting and important themes.  The Criminal is a masterful work of fiction.  It's the kind of book that reminds us how powerful writing can be.	2004-08-27

He's really a Soviet spy, one of an elite group of agents groomed since childhood to infiltrate key institutions in the United States.  But something has changed.  His recent assignments bear little or no relation to the national interests of the USSR.  And to further complicate matters, there is a continual barrage of news from Moscow pointing to the Soviet Union's imminent disintegration. <br />As a result, Ash does not know whom to trust, where to take his orders from or where his loyalties should lie.  He falls for a girl named Jennifer, the host of a call in radio talk show.  But can he really trust her?  Could the FBI or even the KGB have sent her his way? <br />The Last Spy is an intriguing novel which captures the all consuming paranoia that is an unavoidable occupational hazard for any undercover agent.  It has a sufficient amount of suspense and there are several very clever plot devices. <br />All in all, this is an intelligently contructed spy novel which most readers should find quite entertaining.	2004-08-25

Written with sufficient surrealism to easily accomodate a supporting character that happens to be a talking dog, there just isn't anything here to engage the reader's interest. <br />The main character, Todd Kent, is an early incarnation of Roy Dillon, the young L.A. con artist Thompson so masterfully brought to life in The Grifters.  But that's where any similarity between the two novels begins and ends. <br />The Golden Gizmo is a real clunker.  Sometimes even great writers like Jim Thompson will step up to the plate and strike out.  Not recommended.	2004-08-21

The Shark Infested Custard by Charles Willeford is hard to categorize, even harder to review and impossible to forget. <br />It's about four young men who are the best of friends.  Four average guys who happen to be extremely shallow, selfish and misogynistic.  To put it more bluntly, they're sleazeballs pure and simple.   <br />Most of the action takes place in Miami.  It's the 1970's. Larry is an ex-cop, Hank a pharmaceutical detail man, Eddie a pilot, and Don a silverware salesman.  All four are tenants of Dade Towers, a singles only apartment complex.  Life for them could not be better, especially when it comes to having plenty of promiscuous sex. <br />Willeford divides the novel into four parts. <br />Part I is narrated by Larry.  In it, Hank makes a knuckleheaded bet with the other three.  He stands to win $60 if he can pick up a woman at a drive-in movie. What starts out as a comic romp turns to tragedy as two people wind up dead before the night is through. (As an aside, this part of The Shark Infested Custard  has since been republished as a stand alone short story entitled Saturday Night Special in a Willeford collection called The Second Half of the Double Feature, 2003). <br />Hank narrates Part II.  He describes an ill fated affair he has with a mystery woman named Miss Jannaire.  It's wickedly funny, and like Part I, has a killing in it. And there's an unexpected twist at the end which Alfred Hitchcock would appreciate. <br />For Part III, Willeford goes to a third person narration.  By this time, Larry and Hank have moved out of state for career advancement.  Eddie is shacked up with a rich widow who bores him to tears and Don has moved back to the suburbs to be with his wife, a woman he detests with a passion.  This portion of the book is primarily about a harebrained scheme Don has developed to escape from his spouse. <br />In Part IV, the narration is once again provided by Larry.  The Four Musketeers have been reunited and they celebrate their friendship and their overall good fortune.  But there's a shocking ending which will leave you slack-jawed. <br />No one writes like Charles Willeford.  The Shark Infested Custard is filled with riotously funny observations presented in deadpan fashion.  The four main characters are truly remarkable literary creations.  I think it's their complete and utter ordinariness that makes their selfish, antisocial behavior all the more disturbing. <br />This is a book like no other.  Funny and shocking at the same time.  Read The Shark Infested Custard.  I can guarantee you will not be bored.	2004-08-19

Mr. Paradise pretty much signs his own death warrant the minute he informs Montez, his man friday, that there's been a change of plan.  He's decided to bequeath the house to his granddaughter and not to Montez as he had previously promised.  But Chloe wasn't supposed to die too.  That's Chloe Robinette, a call-girl and Paradiso's favorite playmate.  She wasn't supposed to have been there when the hitmen Montez hired came a calling. <br />Frank Delsa of Detroit Homicide is the lead detective assigned to the case.  Frank is a seasoned investigator who displays a presumably rare lapse in professionalism when he becomes involved in an affair with Kelly Bart, Chloe's lingerie model roommate and a key witness to the crime. <br />This book is a great example of the kind of smart, hip crime writing Elmore Leonard does better than anyone else.  His famously pitch-perfect ear for dialogue has never been more acute than it is here.  And the reader is introduced to an entertaining and diverse collection of really dumb criminals who keep doing inexplicably dumb things.  As the narrative unfolds, Leonard adds in a number of nice touches.  Like a flashback scene where Delsa and his late wife, also a cop, confront a pair of thugs in a parking lot. <br />If there's anything wrong with this book, I couldn't find it.  It's great to see that Leonard still has the touch that has made his writing so distinctive and beloved.  Mr. Paradise ranks right up there with the Dutchman's best novels.  Old fans will love it.  For readers new to Leonard, it's a great place to start.	2004-08-17

From the prolific pen of legendary crime writer Elmore Leonard, Mr. Majestyk is a short, straightforward action adventure novel with a touch of romance.  Vince Majestyk is an Arizona melon grower who rather unwisely incurs the wrath of a professional killer.  It's a story of cat and mouse that rapidly changes to one of cat and cat. <br />This is a solidly written novel, which I'd have to characterize as a lesser work of the Leonard canon.  The dialogue, as we've come to expect from Leonard, rings very true.  Quirky characters and off the wall situations, staples of the author's best fiction, do not play much of a role here. <br />Mr. Majestyk is an easy, enjoyable read.  But it is not the unique brand of writing that accounts for Elmore Leonard's stellar reputation. <br /> <br />	2004-08-13

In it, Freemantle skillfully interweaves several interesting and distinct plot threads.  This motivates the reader to keep going on to the next chapter in order to find out what is happening on a wide variety of fronts.  Secondly, there's lots of introspection.  And by that I mean the thought processes of the characters are revealed in stark detail.  Consequently, the reader is made privy to exactly why characters say and do what they say and do.  This technique adds an extra dimension to the narrative, making it much richer than that usually found in similar works of fiction.  Moreover, the lead character, Claudine Carter, is well fleshed out, as are many of the supporting cast. Freemantle deserves praise for taking the time to give us characters that come off as real people and not just unidimensional stereotypes.  By way of warning, I should mention that Mind Reader's subject matter is a bit gruesome, at times graphically so. Some readers might find that aspect of the book disturbing.	2004-08-13

The narration in this fascinating gem of a novel is provided by the main character, Collie.  Collie is an escaped mental patient and as such he is homeless, friendless and directionless.  Quite by chance, he makes the acquaintance of Fay Anderson, a young widow who drinks too much.  Fay introduces him to an associate of hers, an ex-cop and two-bit swindler known only as Uncle Bud. <br />Uncle Bud has plans for a crime which will make all three of them rich.  Now Collie may be certifiably insane but he is not stupid.  He sees Uncle Bud for what he is and initially steers clear.  But because he is attracted to Fay and because he has no place else to go, he changes his mind and, against his better judgement, agrees to become part of their hopelessly doomed scheme. <br />Reading After Dark, My Sweet is much like watching a train wreck as it unfolds.  You want to cover your eyes but you can't. Thompson's writing is just too compelling. He masterfully takes the reader on a relentlessly downward spiral into complete and utter chaos while simultaneously introducing unforseen surprises every step of the way.  <br />This is a great novel.

A palpable feeling that the ending is not going to be a happy one. <br />There's plenty of dialogue in this novel and, interestingly, it at times takes on a rat-ta-tat-tat rhythm similar to what one would find in a David Mamet screenplay.  <br />The Out is Death is a classic example of pulp fiction.  It is an interesting read but it doesn't have the intensely gripping quality of Jim Thompson's The Grifters or David Goodis' Shoot the Piano Player.  Two great noir novels whose subject matter and underlying theme are quite similar to this one's. <br />The Out is Death is good, not great. A solid 3 stars.	2004-08-06
US	48738119	R12JKNVNKFSTOU	0449221180	512657531	Native Tongue	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Laughs on every page.	Native Tongue is a way over the top, hysterically funny satire of life in South Florida. <br />With incomparable skill, Hiaasen spins a whopper of a tale in which a grandmotherly but militant environmentalist fearlessly takes on a Mr. Francis X. Kingsbury, the very shady owner of a third rate Disney World wannabe theme park. It seems that Kingsbury's insatiable desire for real estate developement threatens to destroy the ecology of a segment of Florida's Atlantic coast. <br />Another character, the environmentally conscious Joe Winder (serving as Carl Hiaasen's alter ego) is an investigative reporter whose career is on the skids. In fact he has sunk so low that he now finds himself working in public relations at the aforementioned theme park.   <br />This book is overflowing with delightfully funny characters both human and animal.  For example, there's Pedro Luz, the steroid addicted chief of security who is impervious to pain and oblivious to the ravages his drug use is causing his body and mind. There's Joe's girlfriend, Nina, who makes her living in the phone sex industry. And not to forget Bud and Danny, two dimwitted burglars who are recruited to kidnap the two sole  <br />surviving blue-tongued mango voles and live to regret the day they ever got involved in such an assignment.  On the nonhuman side of the ledger can be found Dickie the Dolphin, a theme park attraction who unfortunately is prone to becoming amorous toward humans of either sex. <br />Skink, the reclusive roadkill eating ex-governor and state trooper Jim Tile, Skink's guardian angel are two recurring Hiaasen characters whose appearance in this book is most welcome and adds greatly to the fun. <br />Native tongue is a pricelessly funny satiric novel whose outrageous situations and off the wall characters are supremely entertaining.  Moreover, Hiaasen's ear for dialogue is pitch perfect.  This is one funny book.  Do yourself a favor and read it.	2004-08-05
US	48738119	R1RAR3CO4I86ZL	0892964510	149571034	Voodoo, Ltd.	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Convoluted, but in a good way.	The book's title, Voodoo, Ltd., derives from a mispronounciation of Wudu, Ltd., a London based detective agency run by two Americans, Artie Wu and Quincy Durant.     Early in the course of this smartly written dark comedy, a wealthy German businessman with the improbable name of Enno Glimm hires Wu and Durant to locate a pair of British hypnotists who have suddenly gone missing in Southern California. Glimm suspects that the hypnotists are about to blackmail Ione Gamble, a Hollywood actress-director, who has been charged with murdering her ex-fiance. Which is to say that Voodoo, Ltd. is the granddaddy of all shaggy dog stories. And what an entertaining one it is!     Before descending onto the Los Angeles scene, Wu and Durant hire three former colleagues to assist them. They are; Booth Stallings a 65 year old counterterrorism expert, Georgia Blue, a statuesque former Secret Service agent who has spent the last five years in a Manila prison, and Maurice Otherguy Overby, an adventurer with dubious ethical standards. Together, these five very colorful and supremely resourceful characters use every trick in the book to solve the mystery while at the same time making sure that one or more of them doesn't double cross the others.    This is a deliciously witty, irreverent novel. Believable? Not for a minute. It's not meant to be.    It is meant to be a hilariously funny, over the top, comedic novel. And by that standard, it is an overwhelming success. Read Voodoo, Ltd., you'll love it.	2004-07-30

Not The Survivor's Club. Lisa Gardner has served up a gourmet meal with this one.  <br /> She has taken the time to give us an intricate plot which unfolds in such a way as to maximize suspense while keeping the reader engaged. Furthermore, the characters are richly fleshed out, thereby making both them and the story interesting and believable. <br /> And for the more serious minded reader, The Survivor's Club delivers an ample amount of social commentary without being preachy. <br /> This is one great novel. Suspenseful, well constructed, thoroughly engaging, substantial, and at times a bit frightening. The Survivor's Club has it all.	2004-07-28
US	48738119	R2FH2YVBCI3LWI	0375700315	288988780	The Nothing Man	Books	4	2	4	N	N	No exit.	The Nothing Man gets a 4 star rating from me because in it, Jim Thompson takes on subject matter that 99% of writers wouldn't dare go anywhere near.   This very unusual novel is narrated by the main character, Clinton Brown or Brownie.  Brownie is a wounded war veteran who is glib, exceedingly flippant and good at his job as a small town newspaperman.  But Brownie carries with him a terrible secret.  One which I won't divulge here. It's a secret so horrible to contemplate it causes him to drink nonstop and renders him fully capable of committing brutally violent acts to prevent others from learning what it is.  It's rather clear that The Nothing Man was written as a portrayal of one man's descent into madness and not as a realistic crime novel. Still, the plot is too contrived to suit the very real emotional territory being explored. And that is the book's main flaw.  Thompson wrote many books that outshine The Nothing Man, but relatively few of them can match its uninhibited daring.	2004-07-25
US	48738119	R1AF6MFJE8NFQL	0385234902	13741218	Red President	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Richly detailed and suspenseful.	In The Red President, Martin Gross tells the story of a closeted Communist who becomes a contender for the highest office in the land.  Intricately plotted and well researched, this novel gives the reader a look at the inner workings of the CIA and the KGB at a point in history that would turn out to be the waning days of the Soviet Union.  Though not quite as jarring as The Manchurian Candidate, to which it will undoubtedly be compared, The Red President is a suspenseful, action packed Cold War thriller that does not disappoint.  It's safe to say that spy genre fans will find this book highly entertaining.	2004-07-19
US	48738119	R6UMRFGBXBHZZ	0345463234	500157568	Sucker Bet (Tony Valentine)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Lots of action, plenty of laughs.	First of all, let me report some detective work of my own.  At the end of chapter 25, Tony Valentine cites an anecdote which fans of the late Dashiell Hammett will undoubtedly recognize.  It's a close variation of the famous &quot;Flitcraft story&quot; told by Sam Spade in the Maltese Falcon (the book, not the movie).<BR>The rest of Sucker Bet is, however, quite original. In this the third installment of the Tony Valentine series, author James Swain takes us on a hilariously over the top joyride through South Florida.  <BR>The story is a gutsy one.  Complex and full of surprises but at the same time not overly convoluted.  The plot starts off with Tony Valentine investigating a dishonest blackjack dealer at a low rent Indian casino in the Everglades. But that's only the beginning.  Before long, Tony finds he's become involved in a gangster's scheme to make millions from the outcome of a college basketball game.<BR>A lot happens along the way.  Tony is attacked by alligators.  He exposes a clever way of cheating at blackjack.  His beloved neighbor Mabel is taken hostage. And his ne'er do well son, Gerry, cuts short his honeymoon to help his Dad out.  <BR>Swain introduces us to a number of really interesting and colorful characters.  Candy Hart, the redheaded hooker who falls for her client.  Splinters, the Cuban limo driver who doubles as a hitman. Bobby Jewel, the 400 lb bookie and many many more.  But perhaps the most unforgettable supporting character is Mr. Beauregard, the ukulele strumming chimpanzee who is smarter and more insightful than most human beings.<BR>Sucker Bet, like Funny Money and Grift Sense before it, is remarkable for its &quot;readability&quot;.  Page after page and chapter after chapter just flies by.<BR>James Swain is obviously a talented writer. It'll be fun to see what else he has in store.	2004-07-14
US	48738119	R116SJKJ25Q0P5	067030607X	797941804	False Front	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Competent but uninspired.	Paul Silver is a veteran newspaper reporter whose career is in the doldrums.  Out of the blue, he receives a tip that could make him a star.  A prominent Senator is suspected of selling state secrets to the Soviet Union and the FBI has him under surveillance. Of course, things are not as they appear and Silver is drawn into a nasty game of cloak and dagger that places him in real jeopardy.<BR>I'm giving False Front 3 stars because, though fairly predictable, the plot is mildly interesting.  Also the book brings to light the very real rivalry between the FBI and CIA.<BR>There is, however, little else about False Front to cause one to recommend it.  Except for the last 25 or so pages, the narrative is slow paced and frequently verges on being boring.  The dialogue is stilted and not at all convincing.  Accounts of the inner workings of the newsroom do not ring true.  And the same can be said for other descriptions of places and institutions.<BR>Overall, this is a very mediocre novel.  The best thing I can say about it is that it helps the reader appreciate other books where the writing is compelling.   <BR>With the number of political thrillers out there that are so much better, I wouldn't recommend bothering with this one.	2004-07-11

The Magician's Tale is a very well constructed murder mystery that does not disappoint.  The captivating plot unfolds in such a way that I'm sure most readers will have trouble putting the book down. I know I did.  <BR>But this novel has a number of great things going for it besides its very strong plot.  Photojournalist Kay Farrow is the protagonist and narrator.  Her character is extremely well fleshed out and quite believable.  And her voice is a remarkably convincing one.  So much so, it's hard to believe The Magician's Tale is the work of a male author.<BR>Another very positive aspect is the attention to detail. Be it the ins and outs of the photographer's craft or the sights and sounds of San Francisco, an abundance of nicely detailed description is provided.<BR>There is a fair amount of sexual content, much of it on the kinky side.  However, since it is presented in an inoffensive, nonexploitative manner, it serves to enhance rather than detract from the overall storyline.<br />Written with imagination and skill, The Magician's Tale is a fascinating, page turner of a novel.	2004-07-09

The main character is Lew Griffin, an African-American PI with an eclectic literary taste.  Griffin is shot by an unknown sniper as he exits a bar one evening.  He survives but the recovery process takes nearly a year. A year during which he is handicapped by blindness and a loss of sense of time.<BR>This novel is first and foremost a study of Lew Griffin the human being. It examines his relationships with others as well as how his early experiences have influenced his present attitudes and behavior.  The mystery or crime aspect of the novel is a secondary consideration.  Sallis sparingly drizzles in information about Griffin's shooting, including how organized crime and a white supremist group may be involved.<BR>The frequent use of obscure literary references is overdone.  If you are able to understand all of them, then you, my friend, need to get out of the house more.<BR>Quite frankly, I found this book disjointed and hard to follow.  I didn't enjoy it.	2004-07-05

For the princely sum of thirty dollars a week, Eddie provides background music in a rundown dive.  He figures that if he has nothing, nothing can be taken away from him.  And if he stays in the background, like so much wallpaper, no one will ever bother him.<BR>Eddie's strategy for living works quite well.  That is until an untimely visit from his hoodlum brother triggers a cascade of events that threaten his very life.<BR>Shoot the Piano Player is a short allegorical novel that is dark and unapologetically downbeat.  Deceptively simple in its construction, there's a lot of truth about life contained within its pages.  If you take the time to read this book, you will learn more about what makes human beings tick than you ever would by reading any ten psychology texts put together.  An enthusiastic 5 stars.	2004-07-03
US	48738119	RR09FBTF65LUM	0394757688	849452523	The Long Goodbye	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Arguably Raymond Chandler's best novel.	The Long Goodbye is a novel with lots of meat on its bones.  The plot is engaging and complex, the characters are all extremely colorful, the dialogue is superb and the descriptive passages are in a league of their own.  Chandler also provides us with an abundance of social commentary while exploring a number of important themes.<br />One of these themes is the nature of friendship.  At the start of the book, Philip Marlowe, a well established literary character notorious for being a cynical loner, finds a friend.  The friend's name is Terry Lennox and he's what could be described as a lovable lush.  When Terry confesses to committing a brutal crime, Marlowe is unable to believe his friend could ever be capable of such a thing and, against all odds, looks to vindicate him.<br />Along the way, Marlowe meets Eileen and Roger Wade, an unhappily married couple who belong to roughly the same privileged social circle as Terry.  A fabulously successful writer of romance novels, Roger is also a tormented alcoholic.  A good deal of the book is concerned with examining the Wades' dysfunctional marriage.<br />This is a wonderful book, full of insight and bursting with humanity.  It is a marvelous showcase for Raymond Chandler at the height of his literary powers. Highly recommended.	2004-07-02
US	48738119	R31UWI3BJ48074	0671023187	590280047	Term Limits	Books	3	3	6	N	N	An overly contrived premise.	First of all, Term Limits by Vince Flynn does have some good aspects to it.  For example, it contains a discussion of how the CIA has come to depend on technological information gathering while neglecting development of human assets on the ground. Anyone who owns a TV or occasionally reads a newspaper knows that now.  But in the 90's, when this book was written, that information was not common knowledge.  So Flynn obviously did his homework, at least to some extent.<BR>Unfortunately, whatever merit Term Limits might have is completely overshadowed by the novel's very preposterous premise.  Flynn would have the reader believe that a small band of former navy SEALs would be so enraged over the federal government's unwillingness to balance the budget, they would resort to serial assassination as a means of getting it to do so.<BR>The idea of a balanced federal budget is an abstract and sterile concept.  It's just not the kind of issue that would engender the degree of passion necessary to motivate people to kill.  Term Limits is flawed as a work of fiction because its premise is way too far-fetched.	2004-06-26

Written by pulpmaster Jim Thompson, Bad Boy is a collection of autobiographical vignettes that focus on his early life.  As other reviewers have pointed out, many of these stories contain obvious exaggerations and embellishments.  Poetic license, if you will.<BR>The first 25% of the book, the part that deals with his early childhood, is just plain bad.  Reading it is like watching The Little Rascals.  Which is to say it gets old very quickly.  If the entire book were like this, it would only rate one or two stars.  <BR>However, Bad Boy becomes somewhat more interesting as Thompson reaches his teen years and begins to try his hand at different part time jobs, learning important lessons along the way.  Especially engaging is his account of hotel life from a bellhop's perspective.  And later, as he describes his experience as an itinerant oil field worker in West Texas, we are treated to glimpses of good insightful writing.<BR>Overall, this book is a disappointment.  Not surprisingly, the few good parts are almost always found where Thompson tells it like it is, or rather like it was.  The places where he forgoes the embellishments and plays it straight.  After all, though fiction is often best when it sounds like fact, the reverse is seldom the case.	2004-06-15

Charles Latimer is the unlikely protagonist in this classic work by legendary spymaster Eric Ambler.  Latimer is a university professor turned moderately successful crime novelist.  While visiting Istanbul, he learns quite by chance that the body of a career criminal named Dimitrios has recently been fished out of the Bosphorus.  Latimer becomes fascinated by the extent and international flavor of Dimitrios' &quot;rap sheet&quot; and takes it upon himself to retrace the archcriminal's travels over the preceeding 16 or so years.  <BR>This project takes Latimer from Turkey to Greece, from Greece to Bulgaria, from Bulgaria to Switzerland, from....well you get the idea.  At each stop along the way more disturbing information about Dimitrios is revealed.  Before long both Latimer and the reader come to appreciate what a sinister, ruthless snake Dimitrios must have been.  To reveal anymore might spoil the fun.<BR>Written with understated wit, A Coffin for Dimitrios is well crafted, entertaining and, dare I say it, educational.  Originally published 65 years ago, it holds up remarkably well. This is one novel of international intrigue you will not want to miss.	2004-06-15
US	48738119	R26SIKG05KJXJ9	0375701966	115989267	The Moviegoer	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Challenging and complex.	If a novelist, any novelist, could put down on paper an exact representation of human thought, he or she would automatically be elevated to the very pinnacle of the literary world.  But because language has limitations, this very desirable circumstance is, unfortunately, not possible.  Walker Percy has nonetheless tried valiantly to do this very thing.  In The Moviegoer, the reader is made privy to the articulated thoughts of Binx Bolling, a young New Orleans stockbroker. Binx explicitly tells us he is on a search.  A search for something outside the everyday things that make up his life.  Something that will ultimately give his life meaning and thereby fill the emptiness in his heart.<BR>Of course, there really isn't anything outside everyday existence that can measure up to what he is seeking.  The meaning of life, if indeed there is any, can only be found in the everyday things Binx regards as completely unfulfilling.  This existentialist outlook is the underlying theme of The Moviegoer.<BR>The plot (if that's even the right word) is a minimalistic one that very much suits this novel of the mind. Binx himself provides the narration.  In doing so he affects a very formal, unnatural manner of speech, in which words like &quot;thenceforward&quot; and &quot;eschatological&quot; can and do appear.<BR>The Moviegoer is a challenging work of fiction which gives the reader an authentic, nuanced description of life among New Orlean's upper class.  Many readers, if not most, are likely to be turned off by its slow pace and seeming wordiness.  A thoughtful, thought filled novel, not for everyone.	2004-06-10

When he is offered the unlikely assignment of exposing cheating on the pro bass fishing circuit he is justifiably dubious.  But he can't afford to turn down the generous fee.  That's how Double Whammy begins.<BR>This is an extremely funny, way over the top dark comedy where the body count and the laughs quickly start piling up.  But what is it that distinguishes this book from the many other Florida based comedic crime novels that have become so popular in recent years?  Two things, the unrelenting humor and the off the wall characters.<BR>Many books are episodically funny.  And by that I mean there may be a funny situation every 40 or 50 pages.  Double Whammy is genuinely funny all the way through.  Everything that happens is outrageous and the outrageousness steadily increases as the story unfolds.  Few would argue with the observation that Carl Hiaasen's writing displays a take no prisoners tone when it comes to satirizing life as lived in the Sunshine State.<BR>There are more hilariously warped characters in this book than you can shake a fishing rod at.  To mention just two of the more colorful ones:  There's Skink, a roadkill eating recluse with the perfect white teeth of a TV news anchorman. And, my personal favorite, the Reverend Charles Weeb, a profane, sleazy, televangelist whose love of real estate far surpasses his love of any known diety.<BR>Double Whammy is a withering satire that pulls no punches. Its nonstop humor is both biting and original.  If you appreciate writing that isn't afraid to explore the less admirable aspects of what it means to be human, by all means, read this book.  You will enjoy the experience.	2004-06-08

Two Native American women, Sandra Moore and her sister Karen, have been killed in a very grisly fashion.  Robert Payne is a private eye and former FBI profiler who is asked to consult on the case by Cindy Rhodes, a local policewoman.  As it happens, Cindy's husband, David, is the main suspect.<BR>A similar crime had occurred in the same locale nearly a hundred years before and the author, Ed Gorman, cleverly juxtaposes the current investigation with the one that took place way back then.  A remarkable juggling act to be sure.<BR>Some interesting twists are revealed as the plot unfolds and Payne ultimately brings the guilty party to justice in a dramatic showdown at the book's conclusion.<BR>That's the good part.  Now for the bad.<BR>Quite frankly, I find Gorman's writing style, at times, irritating.  Despite the grisliness of the subject matter, he tends to frequently lapse into a type of maudlin prose that has a smarmy earnestness about it.  Most of this out of place sentimentality gains expression through the musings of the lead character, Robert Payne.  This causes Payne's personality to come through in an unflattering manner, as that of an idealistic Pollyanna.<BR>Hawk Moon is an engaging, interesting tale, marred by stylistic choices that detract from its effectiveness.	2004-06-02

As the author explains in the introduction, The Dark Frontier was meant to be a parody of the brand of adventure thriller he enjoyed as an adolescent but came to find rather silly when he reached adulthood.<BR>That Ambler's tongue was firmly implanted in his cheek while writing this novel is quite obvious from the outlandish premise.<BR>Henry Barstow, a mild mannered, straitlaced scientist, sustains a blow to the head which renders him unconscious.  He then awakens as a different person.  He is now Conway Carruthers, an Indiana Jones type action hero.  Barstow as Carruthers travels to a fictitious Balkan state where he helps revolutionaries overthrow the government, squelches a nascent atomic weapons program and pines for the love of an evil countess. All the while risking his life at every turn.<BR>Some insightful social and political commentary can be found in the midst of this intentionally bad novel.  And it's interesting to read Ambler at the beginning of his literary career.  But, since the writers and the writing being parodied, have been long forgotten, it's difficult for the modern reader to fully appreciate the book's intended comic nature.<BR>Overall, I would characterize The Dark Frontier as a decent first effort by a young writer who would go on to accomplish great things. However, I would only recommend it to diehard Eric Ambler fans.	2004-05-31

I had already read the sequel, Funny Money, and quite frankly, had found that book to be rather mediocre.  Grift Sense, I'm pleased to say, is much, much better.<BR>This very entertaining book grabs your interest on page one and holds it to the very end.  Most of the action takes place in Las Vegas and Swain has succeeded in conveying the unique feel of that intriguing place.<BR>Perhaps the most amazing aspect of Swain's writing is its remarkable readability.  Both the dialogue and the narrative portions flow so smoothly, the reader can't help but keep turning pages.  Where this novel differs from the weaker Funny Money is in the critically important areas of character developement and plot construction.  Grift Sense has several well defined characters, each with a number of interesting and many times colorful attributes.  And the plot unfolds in a way that really engages the reader's imagination.<BR>My only gripe about this otherwise appealing novel concerns the way in which the crooks manage to rack up big winnings at the blackjack table.  If this method worked in the real world, it would be used all the time and the game of blackjack would rapidly become unprofitable to casinos.<BR>Grift Sense is a lot of fun to read.  I'm looking forward to seeing how the third Tony Valentine adventure, Sucker Bet, stacks up against the first two.	2004-05-27
US	48738119	R4CD84FTF0LOD	0394757661	284972551	Playback	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Impressive style redeems weak plotting.	First published in 1958, Playback is the last of Raymond Chandler's seven Philip Marlowe novels.  Most of the narrative unfolds, not in Marlowe's home city of Los Angeles, but in a small resort town near San Diego.  A mysterious redhead named Betty Mayfield is in some kind of trouble and Marlowe takes it upon himself to bail her out.  This despite the fact the exact nature of Miss Mayfield's difficulty is only belatedly revealed to Marlowe (and the reader) at Playback's conclusion.  Few would say this novel ranks among Chandler's best.  It could, however, be argued that Playback is very much \\"vintage\\" Chandler for a number of reasons.  The author's well known knack for delivering insightfully descriptive prose is alive and well within its pages.  Furthermore, there's plenty of great dialogue including Marlowe's delightfully cynical quips that never cease to entertain.  There are also a number of highly memorable vignettes written strongly enough to stand alone completely divorced from their context within the novel.  On the negative side, Playback is also true to Chandler's characteristic inattention to narrative unity.  In Playback, as in a number of the author's other works, there is an almost deliberately perverse failure to tie the various plot elements together in a coherent fashion.  To Raymond Chandler, atmosphere was everything, plot, in many cases, a rather unimportant afterthought.  A worthwhile read for fans of hardboiled crime.	2004-05-25

I've read most of the ones that are available to the general public and have been very impressed by his writing.  Iconoclastic, original, unflinching, unsentimental and nonjudgemental are just a few of the adjectives I would use to describe Willeford's very distinctive brand of story telling.  Pick-Up is no exception.  But this is a very strange book even for Willeford.<br />I think the strangeness derives from the fact that Pick-Up is really two different books contained within a single cover.  The first half describes in raw, realistic detail the hopeless, despairing and desperate, lives of a man and a woman, both alcoholics, barely surviving in post World War II San Francisco. Hard hitting and unapologetic, this is the best part of Pick-Up.<br />Then, about half way through, a completely different novel emerges. The second half of the book consists of one man's account of his first hand experience with the criminal justice system.  And by that I mean jail, the courts and forensic psychiatry. Except that the criminal justice system as described here bears little resemblance to any such system found in the United States or anyplace else.  People, places and events in this part of the book are presented in a surrealistic fashion.  A jarring departure from the book's very authentic first half.<br />Also, the ironic humor which characterizes most of Willeford's other novels is missing from this work.  I say that not as a criticism but rather as a warning to potential readers who, seeing Willeford's name on the cover, may be expecting some good laughs. No, Pick-Up is not that kind of book. Humor would definitely be out of place.<br />Fans of Charles Willeford will enjoy this book, as I did.  People who are not yet familiar with his work would be better served by first reading a few of his other novels and the short stories contained in The Machine in Ward Eleven. It's easier to appreciate Pick-Up by being able to view it in context, as part of Willeford's overall literary output.asier to appreciate Pick-Up by being able to view it in context, as part of Willeford's overall literary output.	2004-05-16
US	48738119	R2WTR8ZYKNQAV0	0440152399	12945359	The Gargoyle Conspiracy	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A pleasure to read.	The Gargoyle Conspiracy is an exciting, suspenseful international thriller that does not disappoint.  Ahmed Bel Jahra is a ruthless, cold blooded terrorist operating under the sponsorship of the Libyan government.  His goal is to make a name for himself by assassinating the American Secretary of State.  All that stands in his way is one man, Simon Hunter, a counterterrorism agent for the State Department.  Marvin H. Albert has created a truly remarkable story which unfolds in a very skillful manner.  The narrative switches back and forth from Bel Jahra's intricate preparations to Hunter's dogged pursuit of the would be assassin and his accomplices.  In the course of this masterfully told tale, the reader is taken to many interesting locales all around Europe and North Africa and is introduced to a number of fascinating, believable characters.  Mr. Albert has done his homework.  That is to say the material presented is extremely well researched. This results in The Gargoyle Conspiracy coming off as frighteningly realistic.  This well constructed, satisfying novel is far too good to remain out of print. It deserves to be reissued and widely read.	2004-05-15

An astounding amount of research went into producing this very informative book.  Richard Reeves has given us a detailed view of the Nixon presidency starting with the first inauguration in January, 1969.  Oddly, except for a very brief epilogue, the book ends in April, 1973 with the resignations of Haldeman and Erlichman.  This despite the fact that Nixon would remain in office more than 15 additional months before resigning himself.  President Nixon: Alone in the White House consists of a chronological compilation of events occuring during Nixon's tumultuous tenure.    The well documented facts presented in this book leave the reader with the following impressions:  On the positive side. Nixon was an extremely knowledgeable politician with a very sophisticated understanding of geopolitics.  He had a clearly defined vision of America's place in the world and was not afraid to take bold steps to enhance the country's position of power on the world stage.  On the negative side.  Nixon, the individual, was petty, vindictive, distrustful and self delusional.  He was very much a loner who spent an inordinate amount of time by himself.  As chief of staff, Haldeman's primary function was to prevent Congressional leaders, Cabinet members and White House staff from getting in to see Nixon.  It appears that the only adviser who had unfettered access was Henry Kissinger. Furthermore, in the Nixon White House, there was no need for the likes of Karl Rove or Karen Hughes.  When it came to public relations and building up the President's image, Nixon handled all of that himself, in microscopic detail. And we find in Nixon a man whose moral compass was more than slightly askew. The Watergate break-in, which ultimately led to his downfall, was only one of a number of illegal or unethical acts sanctioned by Nixon to gain advantage over his political adversaries.  President Nixon: Alone in the White House is a valuable resource for understanding the Nixon presidency.  Anyone readingthis book, no matter what their level of knowledge about Nixon might be, will be guaranteed to learn new things about this fascinating, enigmatic figure.	2004-05-10

The High Window is a fast paced, intricately plotted story inhabited by an abundance of interesting and colorful characters.  Once again, Raymond Chandler has succeeded in painting very vivid pictures of the various locales depicted with his unique brand of highly descriptive prose. A relatively short novel, The High Window is packed with page after page of interesting twists and turns, memorable characters and sharp dialogue.         Hard-boiled detective Philip Marlowe is, as always, hard drinking, wise cracking and supremely self confident. A walking, breathing paradox, he adheres to a very high minded code of honor when it comes to protecting client confidentiality yet is not above tampering with evidence.  What starts off as a rather mundane search for a missing rare coin quickly becomes much more complex. Murder, blackmail and the psychological abuse of a vulnerable young woman all play a role in the compelling plot. This novel should appeal to all fans of detective fiction as well as to those who appreciate good writing regardless of subject matter.	2004-05-09
US	48738119	R30LF2XLG2ACG6	0394758277	283946848	Farewell, My Lovely	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Outstanding.	This is a great novel for so many reasons.  The dialogue is clever without descending into cuteness.  The supporting cast of characters is a truly fascinating one. The descriptions of places are vivid.  Be they the homes of the obscenely rich or rundown slum dwellings.  The intricate plot unfolds in a way that really holds the reader's interest with a couple of nice plump red herrings thrown in for good measure.<BR>As always, Marlowe himself is tough as nails and completely hard-boiled.  Except that towards the end of the book, he surprises us by becoming sentimental.  This uncharacteristic sentimentality is not directed toward either of the two female love interests. But rather toward a tall, violet eyed boatman named Red who helps Marlowe in his hour of need. You really have to admire Raymond Chandler for knowing just when to interject the unexpected.<BR>I would love to give Farewell, My Lovely 5 stars, but I have to deduct 1 star.  The reason?  I can't for the life of me understand what the killer hoped to gain by commiting murder in the first place.<BR>If Mr. Chandler were still alive, I'm sure he would address that particular concern in the manner of a college professor talking to a kindergartener.  I can just imagine him saying: \\"Reality is not straightforward.  Only in the world of fiction are motives clearly defined and unambiguous. My writing is meant to reflect real life.\\" {From The Big Sleep (1939)- \\"It had the austere simplicity of fiction rather than the tangled woof of fact.\\"}	2004-05-02

That particular skill comes in very handy when he returns to Atlantic City to avenge the death of his friend and former partner who has been murdered while investigating a blackjack scammer known only as \\"the European\\".  A great starting point for a detective story if there ever was one.  Unfortunately, Funny Money fails to make the most of this terrific premise.<BR>Before I list my criticisms, let me first say that James Swain deserves credit for writing a book that is extremely readable.  Chapter after chapter just sails by.  Also, the Tony Valentine character is well nuanced with a number of interesting attributes.<BR>Most of the other characters, I'm sorry to say, are not nearly as well developed, making it hard for the reader to get a feel for them.  In fact, some of the crooks are nothing more than one dimensional stereotypes.<BR>The story itself seemed to be cobbled together rather haphazardly with little attention paid to smooth plot developement.  And since so many of the characters, from the casino owner on down, are involved in something shady, the reader rapidly loses interest in finding out which of the multiple rip-offs resulted in Tony's partner's untimely death.<BR>Funny Money provides a rare look into the fascinating world of casino gambling.  There are a number of clever lines and some of the situations are entertaining.  But ultimately, the book disappoints because of a failure to use interesting, believable characters to tell an engaging story.	2004-04-27

Originally published in 1939, The Big Sleep is the first novel to feature fiction's legendary private eye, Philip Marlowe.  The book starts off with Marlowe visiting the majestic estate  of dying millionaire, General Guy Sternwood.  As the General hires Marlowe to investigate a bookdealer who is extorting him for one thousand dollars, he happens to mention that he sorely misses the company of his son-in-law, an ex-bootlegger, who has inexplicably disappeared. A very fast paced and eventful search for the truth ensues, during which Marlowe encounters many colorful characters.  Topping the list are the two wild Sternwood daughters, Carmen and Vivian.<BR>The Big Sleep contains subject matter considered racy by 1939 standards.  Specifically, pornography and homosexuality both play key roles in advancing the story.  Chandler's writing is no less than masterful.  The dialogue snaps, the descriptive passages are vivid and the complex plot comes together at the end.<BR>There are really two main characters, Marlowe himself and the city of Los Angeles.  Marlowe is a loner and if he is not an alcoholic, he could easily be mistaken for one.  Always ready with withering put downs, he is a world class cynic who paradoxically adheres to a high minded code of honor.  Los Angeles is portrayed as a dreary place, often rain soaked and in the throes of serious growing pains.  The claustraphobic, shattered lives of many of its inhabitants made all the more grotesque by the coexisting wealth and glamor.<BR>The Big Sleep has earned its reputation as an American classic and definitely qualifies as a must read.	2004-04-18

If you are easily offended, do not read The Grifters. In this classic example of pulp fiction, Jim Thompson takes us on a cruel and hideous journey through a few weeks in the life of Roy Dillon, a practitioner of the short con working in Los Angeles.  Thompson's writing is raw and unflinching.  No holds are barred, no topic is taboo.  He has created a fascinating portrayal of society's criminal netherworld in a way that is thoroughly engaging even as it dares you not to avert your eyes. Reading The Grifters is a powerful, visceral experience that stays with you.	2004-04-09
US	48738119	R2VA1F16EI1XS0	0688169716	189768883	Split Images	Books	5	12	12	N	N	This book delivers the goods.	At the beginning of Split Images, two Detroit natives meet in Palm Beach after one of them has shot a Haitian burglar. Robbie Daniels is a multimillionaire industrialist fascinated by guns. Walter Kouza is a former Detroit cop with a well deserved reputation for being trigger happy.  Walter is flattered that a rich guy is even interested in talking to a working stiff such as himself.  So when Robbie offers Walter a job as his personal chauffeur he accepts the position without much hesitation.  As it turns out, Robbie is really a psychopath who has been reading too many spy novels.  He has come to think of himself as some sort of international assassin and believes that Walter's background in law enforcement will be helpful as he pursues his human quarry. The two other main characters in this darkly funny story are Bryan Hurd, a detective in Detroit Homicide and Angela Nolan, a freelance journalist.  The two of them are on to Robbie's plan and work to foil him and Walter before the plan can be carried out.  Bryan and Angela also become romantically involved with each other in a subplot very germane to the overall structure of the novel. Elmore Leonard is in top form here.  The dialogue is realistic, funny and plentiful.  The bad guys are believable enough to be interesting but unbelievable enough so you don't have to feel guilty when some of their murderous antics make you laugh.  The action takes place in both Detroit and South Florida and Leonard pulls off the changes in locale with ease.  The plot is developed in a very skillful manner and there is an unconventional ending which some might find shocking. I have to agree with the reviewer who said he didn't understand why Split Images isn't better known.  This book is a prime example of why Elmore Leonard's reputation as a great writer is well deserved.	2004-04-06
US	48738119	RH2QO9COL4INM	0679722580	262981597	The Continental Op	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Engaging stories, beautifully told.	The key to Dashiell Hammett's greatness is found in his unique writing style.  His sentences flow effortlessly across the page.  Many imitators have come and gone but none have matched his smooth yet jarring prose.    The Continental Op, or operative, is that nameless San Francisco detective whose personal life away from the job, if indeed he has one, remains the greatest mystery of all.  Edited by Steven Marcus, this delightful book is a collection of seven short stories all of which feature the title character.   Every story contained in this volume is first rate. Each drips with delicious descriptions of greed, deception and betrayal and each is skillfully constructed so as to maximize suspense. Read this book. You will not be disappointed.	2004-04-03
US	48738119	R7JC4YKQ0EV39	0425178552	40123285	Wake Up Little Susie	Books	3	7	7	N	N	A workmanlike effort that lacks punch.	This murder mystery contains all the necessary elements.  A clever, likeable investigator who does double duty as narrator.  A clearly delineated sense of time and place.  An intriguing murder with a number of potential suspects.  And a surprise ending which, if not entirely convincing, is at least plausible on some level.    Sam McCain is a 23 year old private eye who also happens to be a lawyer.  He loves the small Iowa town in which he grew up and where he still lives.  Almost everyone is fond of Sam and his only discernible vice is that he smokes too much.  When a woman's body is found in the trunk of an Edsel, Sam is pressed into service to find the killer.  As the investigation unfolds, there are many scenes which serve to evoke the feel of life in smalltown America in the 1950s.  Moreover, author Ed Gorman gives us a fair amount of good natured humor and the occasional moment of poignancy.    For me, two words sum up the mood of this novel, breezy and nostalgic.  Gorman has done a competent, workmanlike job in writing this book.  Somehow though, after turning the last page, I felt vaguely unsatisfied.  It was as if I had completed a tasty meal and still felt just as hungry as I was when I started.  Or as the precocious Sam McCain might have put it, \\"I guess nostalgia isn't what it used to be\\".	2004-03-30
US	48738119	RE89T9F70HWGE	0679722653	704025106	Woman in the Dark	Books	5	0	1	N	Y	A timeless tale, well told.	Woman in the Dark is a 76 page novella and should be judged as such.  Holding what is essentially a long short story to the same standards as a full length novel is both unrealistic and unfair.  Character development and intricacy of plot both must necessarily play diminished roles under the restrictive novella format.    The principle characters, Brazil and Luise, are two very interesting literary creations.  Hammett gives the reader several hints as to their respective backstories, but much is left unsaid.  It therefore falls to the reader and his or her imagination to flesh out the details as to how these characters have come to find themselves in the circumstances described in this novella.    Think of Woman in the Dark as you would a radio play.  Not everything is presented clearly so you are forced to use your imagination.  Such participation on the reader's part carries with it its own type of satisfaction.  Read Woman in the Dark and appreciate it for what it is.  A timeless tale of love and jealousy told in crisp, unadorned language. Highly recommended.	2004-03-25
US	48738119	R18MBRUVQB49OG	039475767X	10448117	The Little Sister	Books	3	7	10	N	N	There's a lot here to enjoy.	Before reading this book, make sure you have a large blackboard and plenty of chalk. At least half a dozen different colors.  Because that's what you'll need to diagram out the plot of The Little Sister.  Keeping straight who's who and who did what to whom and why will give you plenty to do as you read and reread the pages of this Philip Marlowe mystery.  Now I know what you're going to say.  With Raymond Chandler, it's not about the story, it's about atmosphere.  True enough.  But I still have to believe that the reader's enjoyment is greatly enhanced if the writer has provided a coherent plot as a framework for displaying literary dexterity.  In other words, the story itself isn't all important, but it is somewhat important.<BR>As I see it, there are no less than four ways to view this novel.<BR>The first way is as a murder mystery. A young woman from Manhattan (Manhattan, Kansas that is) hires Marlowe to find her missing brother. His subsequent search does eventually locate the young man but not before a drunk and a grifter are both murdered with an ice pick to the vicinity of the medulla oblongata. What is the motive behind these grotesque slayings? The motive is the urgent need to find a particular photograph. A photograph that shows two people sitting down to dinner in a restaurant. I'm not kidding.<BR>The second way to view The Little Sister is as an affectionate sendup of noir crime writing in general and Dashiell Hammett's Maltese Falcon in particular. This might explain why the complications are endless and so very difficult to follow. Perhaps Chandler felt the need to exaggerate the number and degree of plot twists in order to make a satiric point.<BR>Thirdly, The Little Sister is a withering look at Hollywood and the recognizable types who dwell within.  Second rate actors, self important talent agents, ambitious starlets, jaded actresses and befuddled studio heads are all lampooned to one degree or another here.  I found this aspect of the book to be highly entertaining and would have liked to have seen it emphasized even more.<BR>And lastly, this book can be taken as a view into the mind of a man slowly losing his grip.  This Marlowe is world weary, tired.  He's lonely and exasperated.  Chandler has Marlowe questioning his own sanity for continuing to pursue his chosen profession.<BR>Marlowe's investigation takes him to many places in and near Los Angeles.  A seedy hotel, a rundown boarding house, the police station, and a working movie set to name only a few.  Chandler brilliantly describes all locales with an amount of detail that serves to set the exact mood he wants to convey.  Marlowe's steady output of cynical quips, some spoken, others only thought, are first rate and at times absolutely priceless.  It is a tribute to Chandler's originality, as well as his keen wit, that readers never tire of this ongoing patter.<BR>The Little Sister has a lot to recommend it. I just don't think one should have to work so hard to be able to follow a storyline.  And oh yes, be sure to read The Maltese Falcon first.	2004-03-22
US	48738119	R2OIEJ286MWZYL	1930997353	984710140	The Black Mass of Brother Springer	Books	5	15	17	N	Y	Thoroughly original.	This off beat novel takes place in the segregated South of the 1950's.  In it, Charles Willeford tells the improbable tale of Sam Springer, aka Brother Deuteronomy.  For $20 cash, Springer simultaneously purchases both a certificate of ministerial ordination and an appointment as pastor of a 100% African-American church in Jacksonville, Florida. Two problems. First of all, Springer is a white man who by his own admission knows very little about black people.  Secondly, he is an atheist who knows and cares nothing about religion.  Despite these two handicaps, Brother Springer takes to his new found position like a fish to water.  Within a very short period of time, he organizes a citywide civil rights protest while also setting about the task of seducing the beautiful young wife of one of his congregants. That in a nutshell is the story of The Black Mass of Brother Springer.<BR>Charles Willeford loves to take on sacred cows. And in this book, he takes on the most sacred of all cows, religion itself. He also skewers segregationists and racists in general by comically revealing their warped sense of reality with their own words.  A fairly courageous thing to do in 1958, the year this book was originally published.  A time when the civil rights movement had barely begun.<BR>This novel has much in common with other works by Willeford.  It is funny, sometimes in a lighthearted way, sometimes in a very dark way.  It is extremely irreverent and at times it is quite disturbing, even shocking. It is not politically correct nor is it ever dull.  Willeford often likes to punctuate his fiction with sudden unexpected acts of violence. There's some of that here but it's minimal when compared to many of his other novels.<BR>James Sallis quotes the author in the book's introduction as to his secret for successful writing.  Willeford said that only when he stopped caring what others thought of his work was he able to write in earnest.  In other words, Willeford put down on paper onlywhat he genuinely felt without regard to how the reader might perceive it.  Only by this means, he believed, would the truth have a chance of coming out.<BR>As mentioned before, there are disturbing aspects to this book.  To me the most disturbing is that there isn't a single African-American character who is not hoodwinked by Springer despite his being a very foolish man and an obvious charlatan.  I don't know why Willeford chose to write the book this way or whether he ever explained this choice in his 30 years of life after The Black Mass of Brother Springer was first published.<BR>Nevertheless, this is an unforgetable work which entertains while educating and challenging the reader.  Isn't that the very definition of great literature?	2004-03-13

This international thriller takes the reader on a roller coaster ride that doesn't stop until the very last page.<BR>If, as many believe, The Day of the Jackal is the greatest novel of international intrigue ever written,  The Devil's Alternative cannot be far behind.<BR>Maxim Rudin is the President of the USSR and General Secretary of the Communist Party. He's having a very bad year. Not only is his health failing but his country faces an impending famine.  His enemies within the Politburo are plotting to oust him from power even as a group of Ukrainian nationalists plan murder and mayhem to embarrass the regime.  The US President, Bill Matthews, has come to the realization that only a massive infusion of American grain can prevent a starving Soviet Union from starting World War III.<BR>Superimposed on this backdrop are a number of other interesting subplots. These include a forbidden romance between a British intelligence officer and a Russian woman and the maiden voyage of the largest oil tanker the world has ever seen.<BR>Forsyth seamlessly weaves together all plot elements in a way that captures the reader's imagination and holds it at gunpoint.  Throughout the book, there are a number of genuinely surprising twists which are really quite remarkable to behold.<BR>The meticulous attention to detail that characterizes all of Forsyth's writing is very much alive and well here.  It's hard to imagine the scope and depth of research that went into bringing this book to life.<BR>The Devil's Alternative is a monumental achievement. Highly recommended.	2004-03-10

Chandler's Philip Marlowe is the prototype for all the hard-boiled private eyes who have come down the literary pike after him.  Marlowe is never fully dressed unless he has a cigarette dangling from his lip.  Always ready with cynical quips, he consumes distilled spirits the way the rest of us take in oxygen.  And when it comes to solving a case, Marlowe never bends the rules.  No, he ignores the rules completely.<BR>The Lady in the Lake starts off with Marlowe being hired by a business executive, who wants to locate his missing wife. She's described as being quite a handful.  Young, blond and two times a maniac.....klepto and nympho.  Within about two days, Marlowe runs across two dead bodies and finds that a death ruled a suicide 18 months before is really a covered up murder. The plot contains many unexpected twists and turns that serve to keep the reader interested and very curious about what is going to happen next.  If I have any criticism of this book at all, its that a couple of the many plot devices seem a bit contrived.<BR>In describing people, places and things, Chandler does not spare the adjectives.  His remarkable prose provides very vivid images of what is happening and thereby allows the reader to be transported right into the narrative.  <BR>So, do yourself a favor and read The Lady in the Lake.  You'll find out why Raymond Chandler's stellar reputation is so richly deserved.	2004-03-03

Mobtown by Jack Kelly is a well researched crime novel set in Rochester, NY during the summer of 1959.  Kelly does a great job in conjuring up that particular place and time.      Early on in Mobtown, the novel's protagonist and narrator, Ike Van Savage PI, is hired by Vicky Petrone, the beautiful wife of a local crime boss who has reason to believe her husband wants to kill her.  As the investigation unfolds, Van Savage finds out there may be a connection between this case and two other cases he has on his plate.  One a series of arsons, the other an adultery investigation.  Eventually, Ike and the reader both learn in piecemeal fashion that Vicky has a very interesting past that she had failed to voluntarily reveal.    My problem with this otherwise appealing book centers around the way in which the various plot threads are ultimately tied together and resolved.  Without giving too much away, I will only say that the novel's surprise ending is less thsn satisfying. The guilty party who is finally brought to justice is someone who in the real world would lack the means, motivation and street smarts necessary to carry out the complex web of crime the author has described.     Jack Kelly is obviously a talented writer. A less contrived, more convincing plot, would have made Mobtown a great crime novel.	2004-02-23

That is when he's not engaged in more legitimate endeavors like carpet cleaning or picking cucumbers.  Nancy is a risk taking party girl with a mean streak a mile long.  The Big Bounce is largely about the odd relationship between these two rather unsympathetic characters.  Nancy wants to use Jack to pull off a big heist.  Jack pretty much just lives from day to day.  The words loyalty, ambition and commitment evidently are not part of his vocabulary.<br />Elmore Leonard's talent for writing realistic dialogue is well represented here.  As is his signature habit of populating his books with quirky characters.  The plot is somewhat on the thin side and a few of the scenes appear to have been added in for padding.  The Big Bounce is an easy and amusing read.  But not one of Leonard's best efforts by a long shot.	2004-02-13

As a huge Charles Willeford fan, I try to read everything by the master I can get my hands on.  Taken as a whole, this collection of 25 short works does not come up to his usual high standards. Six or 7 of the included works do qualify as compelling reading. An unfinished novel entitled &#34;The First Five in Line...&#34; is vintage Willeford. It has wonderful character sketches and  insightfully predicts the current phenomenon of reality TV. Too bad it was never completed. Also among my favorites is &#34;The Man who Loved Ann Landers&#34;, a short story consisting of a series of letters by a delusional lumberyard owner to the well known syndicated columnist.  It is hilarious and very well crafted. Unfortunately, too many of the other stories miss the mark by lacking sufficient substance to make for a satisfying reading experience.  The Kafka inspired &#34;Everybody's Metamorphosis&#34;, which is apparently intended to be a satire of literary criticism, comes off as just plain tedious.  Exactly the opposite of what one expects from Charles Willeford.	2003-12-17
