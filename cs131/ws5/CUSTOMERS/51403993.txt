This thriller is a sequel to Concept of Justice, where we first met Marty Lovett, a 74 year old man whose sordid past came back to haunt him.  This time around, Marty shows that not only did he not learn his lesson, if anything, he becomes even more ruthless and conniving in his pursuit to get away with crime, and cover it up.<br /><br />Mr. Custer intricately weaves a very interesting tale filled with suspense, mystery, mayhem, and intrigue.  This sequel is more graphic, and a bit more violent that its predecessor, but that only makes for better reading.  His knowledge of the setting is evident, and his expert story telling is compelling.<br /><br />For anyone who thinks that they can \\"get away\\" with crime, or wrong doing, this book should teach them otherwise.  Justice will be done, but in what form?  For Marty Lovett, it was bizarre, yet deserved.  This is highly recommended for all.	2005-08-06

Nick Seven, the retired CIA agent we met in the critically acclaimed Memories Die Last, once again thrills us with further intrigue and action from the Florida Keys. This time, his fianc&eacute;'s brother leaves a mysterious call just as he's murdered for no apparent reason.  As CIA agents surprisingly pop back into Nick's life, the mystery, and the danger deepen. Once again, the war on terror invades the idyllic life that Nick and Felicia are trying to carve out for themselves.<br /><br />One of the nice surprises on this book is that just when you think all is well, and the ends neatly resolved... BAMM!  There are a few surprises left for you and the characters. Corruption, assassination, killers, drugs, the underworld, and industrial power all drive this tale with page turning fervor.<br /><br />Tim Smith once again proves his talent as a writer.

'Mr. Hate' takes us into the world of \\"snuff films\\", and the grisly realism compels you to turn the page, time after time.<br /><br />The story weaves an intricate plot that comes together in a surprise ending that not only did you not see coming, but shocks you to the very core. More than a venture into the disgusting and gruesome, this book proves once again that Mr. Vinson knows how to grab you by the throat, break your heart, and sigh for breath after he's done with you.<br /><br />For anyone who enjoys the likes of Stephen King, or Dean Koontz, this is a must read!	2004-10-27

Anyone who is familiar with Mr. Vinson's works knows that although he has written full length book-long stories, (MR. Hate, Deflector), his forte is the short story, particularly if the series of stories is tied together by a central theme.  Passports to Hell completes the trilogy of such books, making a fitting bookend to Skeletal Remains, and Bloodlines: Legacies of Madness.<br /><br />The unique thing about this book is that the central theme story is so captivating, you almost hate to be distracted by the interludes that riddle it.  But that quickly gives way to the thrill, the shock, and yes, even revulsion that engulfs you. \\"Ravaged\\" will gross you out, but in the end will be one of your favorites.  After reading \\"Boils\\", you will never look at one of your pimples the same again. \\"The Dead Sea, indeed..\\" is reminiscent of the `Flying Dutchman', but the eeriness will leave you shaking with chills.<br /><br />I could go on and on, but the real flavor of this suspense/thriller can only be appreciated first- hand.  That Mr. Vinson has established himself as a premier horror/suspense writer cannot be denied.  I anxiously await the next release from his prolific and powerful pen.	2004-10-26

This book accurately and vividly details the life of the common soldier in the Union army during the Civil War.  You follow along with Nathan Clark as he lives through the travails of Antietam, Fredricksburg, and Gettysburg.  The story is rich with the description of armies on the march, great battles, and the longing for loved ones.<br />Mr. Filegar, aside from being a promising new author, has also been deeply involved in Civil War re-enactments for years, and this is obvious from his writing.  Nowhere, have I seen a better, more thorough description of camp life.  He has captured the essence of the everyday life of the common foot soldier and set it before the reader to delve into.  The humor, the tragedy, the frustration, the hardships, and even the victories overcome you with an emotional impact that leaves you wanting more.<br />The subtitle of this work is \\"Book One\\".

The opening pages of this spellbinding book set the stage for the brutal terror that kills wantonly in order to maintain immortality.  The graphic, repeated rape of Elysia may turn some off in its savagery, but rest assured, this is not pornographic, but rather, realistic.  Her struggle to find freedom and love tears at your heart, only to be snapped back to trepidation with the onslaught of the demon's murderous fury.  The demon who is her very own mother.<br />This book is written in a style very reminiscent of the master, Stephen King. It could be said that it is Fire Starter, Carrie, and Misery all rolled into one.  Very recommended for fans of the horror/suspense genre.	2003-12-11

This is a very well written story about a confederate soldier returning home only to find more troubles.  His family's home has been lost to Yankees, his brother is missing, and the War, it seems, is not over for some people.<br />As Matt Culhane struggles to put his life together, he is drawn into love with a northerner, and the conflict between freed Negroes and those who continue to try to keep them down.  This book keeps your interest from chapter to chapter, and at the same time moves your emotions as you feel the turmoil of the characters involved.<br />This is a must read for anyone who enjoys Westerns, or stories of the Civil War, but more importantly, we should all take a close look at what took place during those times.  Over a hundred years have passed since the Emancipation Proclamation, Civil War, and Reconstruction, and still we as a nation have not won the battle to maintain human dignity and the right to equality.

Solano, who he raised as a son, is urging him to pass on the Datura basket and let him become the Keeper of the Pathway.<br />But this cannot be.

You really come to not only know the characters, but feel their pain as well. This is a page turner in every sense of the word.

The first thing to say about this powerful book is that it is not your typical Science Fiction.  In fact, forget about sci-fi altogether in this book.  Sure, there are myriads of worlds throughout the galaxy, with space flight and incredible futuristic weapons and technology.<br />And that's where it ends.  There are no alien races, no \\"beam me up\\", no bizarre surreal worlds.  This is a war story.  This is the story of one man's journey into hell, and he takes you along with him in emotional and heart-gripping trepidation.  This war could be any war... the intergalactic one of the story, or any of the countless wars that have plagued human kind since the dawn of time. This could take place today, here and now.  The same fears, exaltations, dangers, hopelessness and unrelenting guilt that those who fight in war are vividly portrayed, casting a lesson for all of us.<br />Written in a very militaristic style, you are there as Chase Aarons goes through basic training and moves up the ranks as a warrior, as you experience one ferocious battle after another.  The language and tone are pure military, making the read incredibly real.  Mercifully, the author included a glossary of military acronyms for the reader to refer to.  Any one who has ever been in the military will identify with the style, and story of this book.<br />This is not light reading.  This is gut wrenching and tear- jerking.

This book reminds me of the movie \\"Creepshow\\" of a few years back, where several of Stephen King's short stories were tied together with a running theme.  In this case, the tying theme is a severely haunted house that serves as a meeting place for three would-be horror writers, hosted by three very ominous and unsettling dark hooded figures.<br />There are five different stories presented herein, and each of them is horrific, bloody, and spell-binding.  Each is VERY interesting in its own way, and each is different in its thrust.  This book is not simply a gore factory, although it is not for the squeamish.  The descriptions are fantastic, the characters instantly identifiable, and the tension imminently grabbing.<br />Mr. Vinson writes with the real world in mind, as he repeatedly immerses you in the frightening world of a varied cast of characters.  To those who would complain that its too gory, I would say that even Stephen King said that when given a choice, he'd go for the gore every time.  Mr. Vinson's style is quite reminiscent of King.  I have no hesitation recommending this book	2003-03-04
US	51403993	R3UCZ9ERWS3GFD	1592861288	465205597	Desert Sunshine	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Entertaining, and fun�	This is the first book written by Reece Daniel, and he is to be commended for his effort.  The story of a modern day Arizona Ranger going back in time to 1882, where he is again an Arizona Ranger, is a nice twist.  I like time travel stories as well as westerns, so this fits the bill.<br />The story is generously laced with good descriptions and attention to detail; the comedy of the main character adjusting to life of over 100 years ago is great. The relationship of Native American spiritualism and Christianity is nicely portrayed, and there is plenty of action, too. I especially liked Waddie... the drunken side-kick.<br />Predictably, the main character almost gets caught in on of those \\"space-time continuum\\" paradoxes, but it all works out, and the end leaves you thinking there may be a sequel in the works.	2003-03-03

All Nick Seven wanted after he retired from the CIA was to live a normal life, running his restaurant/bar in Key Largo.  He had almost been able to live with the loss of his love, killed years ago, by his arch enemy, Lavender.  But the past wouldn't let him go. Was Lavender really dead?  And worse, he no longer knew who he could trust.  When his re-assembled \\"team\\" started to fall apart, he had to face the unthinkable.<br />This is a very well written story that is really almost two stories in one.  Just when you think all is well that ends well, you and Nick are drawn in once again, into some unfinished business.  Could he survive one more time? And could he protect Felicia, the Barbadian beauty he had come to love?<br />I just wish the book was longer... I wanted more!  Hopefully, Tim Smith will continue to entertain us with many more stories of \\"Lucky\\" Nick Seven... the newest member of heroes to join the ranks of Dirk Pitt, and Ben Gannon.	2003-02-23

This is a story about a woman's routine life turned upside down by the appearance of an ex-con, and an old boyfriend.

The book has very likeable and believable characters, and a fast moving storyline that makes this a delight to read.  Don't let its poetic, feminine title fool you.

She would listen avidly and write them down, promising herself that these wonderful stories would live on.  This book is the result of that endeavor.  It is a very well written collection of anecdotal remembrances told with rich country dialog, wit, and wisdom.  The hilarious antics will make you laugh and soon you find yourself yearning for more.  This is a terrific book for anyone, especially those who remember, and long for, simpler times. Mrs. Rapier has captured the spirit of the man, and the times.
