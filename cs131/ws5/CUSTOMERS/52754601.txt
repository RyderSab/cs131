While I count my Blessings for having not gone through a divorce myself, in fact I don't even have children yet either,  but I'm still praying that maybe one day I can, someone very close to me  recently has suffered through the pain of a divorce and now she faces life  as a single mother of three children. So when I heard about this book, I  just had to check it out because I so wanted to be  better able to  understand what she is going through so I could then help her better. Now  that I've read the book, the best compliment I can give Sheila's beautiful  and insightful book is that I want to give a copy to my friend. You know,  we all have sisters and girlfriends in this very situation and it is so  important for us all to be there for one another, so please read this book  and then share what you've learned. I know the book has certainly helped me  and I pray that it can help my friend too. <br />Lily of the Valley Carnie,  author, Chi Gung: Chinese Healing, Energy, and Natural Magick	2000-07-16

The characters are all great and well-balanced, the plot is totally fun, and best of all, well, even though it's just a novel, it really hits the truth of what it's actually like being a mutant or a person with special powers and gifts. The book focuses on Rogue and Wolverine and how they deal with being new and young super heros. <br />Sure, some of you might think the idea of super powers is nothing other than comic book and cartoon stuff (after all, that's what the X-Men are most known for) but the totally cool thing is that if you dive into some of the magical esoteric arts like Chi Gung, Shamanism, Wicca, Voodoo, Christian Mysticism, Kabala, and even the lives of Saints and Mystics in virtually all faiths, you'll see that perhaps, just perhaps, this fun book actually has more truth to it than fiction. I guess that's why I love this book so much because it really shows how much of a personal struggle it really is to be blessed with certain unusual gifts. Reading this book gives you a clearer perspective on whether or not you would really find having super powers or mutant abilities to be a blessing or a curse.<br />Lily of the Valley Carnie, author, Chi Gung: Chinese Healing, Energy, and Natural Magick	2000-07-15

I am so incredibly happy, I just bought Denise's new book on losing those last 10 pounds and it is truly wonderful. I am currently in week one but I have already lost 3 pounds and golly, I am so excited. Denise is a gifted  writer and you can really see her passion for health and exercise in her  book. You know something, she really cares about all of us and it is so  beautiful, because as you read, you can sense her love. She has created an  incredibly fun way to lose weight, consisting of eating small meals every  few hours as well as by exercising regularly. One of the fun things I love  doing is what she calls Fidgit-cizers where you simply do any kind of  exercise, such as squats, while you brush and dry your hair or do any other  common chore. This is not only a great program for dropping weight, it's  also a total blast.<br />Lily of the Valley Carnie, author - Chi Gung: Chinese  Healing, Energy, and Natural Magick	2000-05-02

It has a simple country-styled design  with just a few lines to jot down or sketch your feelings of gratitude, but  you know something, I found all the space I needed because for me, even a  single word fills my heart with memories of love and that's where I think  gratitude really lives. This is a fun book and a neat tool of  self-expression and self-awareness. For me, and I imagine for you too, the  book gently guides one deep within to our own smiling soul. I love the  books soft color and gentle designs and I guess that's one of the reasons  why it's fun to carry around in my crazy-quilt purse, ready to be pulled  out beneath a lazy willow or on the banks of a bubbling creek.

John is not only a wonderful soul but he has done a beautiful job of expressing his thoughts on how we can all  learn more about the principles of living a truly powerful and blessed Christian  life. He also does a wonderful job of sharing ideas about other religions  such as Buddhism and Taosim. As a Shaman and a Chi Gung master, I use  slightly different terms than John does regarding some aspects of  spirituality, however, we both speak the same language of the heart as it  is expressed through the Holy Spirit. I highly recommend John's book to  anyone interested in learning some beautiful ways to tap into some of the  hidden secrets and mysteries of Catholicism. John's book has taught me some  beautiful ways to open myself up to the Blessings and Gifts of the Holy  Spirit. As a healer, I have personally experienced many similar stories to  what John talks about and I feel honored to have learned some of his  traditions and also to know John personally. He is a wonderful man and a  great author who really knows how to touch your soul.<br />Lily of the Valley  Carnie, author, Chi Gung: Chinese Healing, Energy, and Natural Magick	1999-11-16

It is extremely well written but beyond that, I felt drawn to it because is shows so clearly how we all can see things quite differently even though we're looking at the same thing. That perspective has helped me in my healing work as a Shaman. I also liked the  characters, even though some of them I didn't like as people, because they  gave me the opportunity to share emotions and to grow from that while  reading.

James has some wonderful books available and while they don't always tell you actually how to do the specific training (there are books out there that actually do, by the way),  you know, in a lot of ways, that's what shamanism is all about, working  with the edge or periphery of things, in other words, figuring the levels  of grayness out for youself. Most importantly, when reading any of his  entertaining books, it's kind of neat to realize that his concepts are  indeed accurate. So I say, read this book, enjoy it, let your mind wander,  and who knows, with the right training, you just might find yourself in  Shambhala someday.

As one of the world's leading practioners of Two-Spirit Shamanism and Chi Gung, as well as being an author (Chi Gung: Chinese Healing, Energy, and Natural Magick), I've  found that in my line of work it is vital that I built my body to it's peak  perfection. I specialize in using the bodies energy (called Chi in Chinese)  to help work with and heal plants, animals, and people. Using this energy  (it is related to Tai Chi, Accupuncture and Yoga - and for those of you who  lift weights, you could think of it as the pump - only in this case, you  not only use it to build muscle but also to increase your health and to  even heal others), I have successfully worked with cases involving  migraines, insomnia, infertility, severe trauma, strokes, paralysis, and  even ovarian cancer. By developing my body, I have been better able to help  my Chi to flow so that I could use my skills in the life and death  situations I am frequently faced with in my line of work. Arnold's book is  wonderful and we are all very blessed to have such a man as a teacher, a  role model, and an author.<br />Reading Arnold's book can change your life. It  sure has changed mine.

What John has done with his book is to tap into one aspect of healing, specifically, back pain, and he shows how the mind can indeed help you to take responsibility and help to heal yourself.

I really enjoyed this book and I found it extremely helpful. As a Chi Gung master, International Healer, and author (Chi Gung: Chinese Healing, Energy, and Natural Magick), I live a life where it is extremely important to have access to any tools one needs in order to help others. I have found that the more I allow myself to be truly me, the more miracles and sychronicities I see in my life. When we open our eyes and accept ourselves, life truly becomes blessed and wonderful.<br />I work as a healer 24 hours a day with plants, animals, and people and in order to do that, I have to listen to my intuition so that I always end up at the right place, doing the right thing, at the right time, with the right tools. And by doing this, I have been able to literally save lives. What I'm trying to say here is that John's book is incredible because it shows the reader that we don't have to give up things in order to help others or lead a fullfilling life. In fact, quite the opposite can be true. By using what we have as tools, we can find ourselves living lives of great spiritual growth and with unlimited opportunity. <br />Buy this book. It will give you a fresh perspective on the way you look at your own happiness and success. It's not what's out there that matters, it's what is inside of yourself. But when you realize that, then you can open yourself to using any tools that you need in order to achieve your dreams. While it might seem strange to many, by finding out what you truly want and then getting it, you can then learn what really makes you happy and then with that happiness, you can change that emotion into internal energy (Chi) so that you can help make a difference. Therefore, a person can indeed live a life that fullfills both their material and spiritual needs.	1999-02-02

It reminds all of us that life can turn in an instant and that we have to deal with what we have. We all are simply who we are, doing the best we can, with what we have, and that's what I see  this book as being all about. As an international healer and author (Chi  Gung), I see the suddeness that changes can bring in a person's life and  Bret's book is all about that. I think that books like this can truly show  all of us just a little bit about who we can be when we must. You may or  may not like the story or even the pacing but going beyond that, there is a  lot to be said here that we all need to periodically remind ourselves of.  Read this book, it is a wonderful novel.	1999-01-21

As a Chi Gung master and Author (CHI GUNG: Chinese Healing, Energy, and Natural Magick - L.V. Carnie) I would like to highly recommend this unique book to anyone interested in the healing arts. Donna has written a truly fascinating, readable, detailed book that explains a variety of exercises and philosophies that anybody can use to help increase their energy levels. Her presentation of material flowed from topic to topic and I found the book not only enjoyable to read but also fun to just flip through while scanning specific treatments.

As a Chi Gung practioner with over 30 years experience, a Shaman, and an Author (CHI GUNG: Chinese Healing, Energy, and Natural Magick), I would like to share that I think that this book is truly  wonderful. It gently teaches a different perspective on Tai Ji, a view that  encourages relaxation, spontanaity, and love. This book is about truly  living in the moment and embracing life with a smile. Sure, there are a lot  of purely technical books out there but I think that many of them actually  miss the whole point of what Tai Ji or the healing arts are all about. What  this book shows is that Tai Ji can be about having fun as you twirl in the  moment with the wonders of childhood. Buy this book. It just might give you  a fresh perspective on life. And with that, you can look at any challenge  from a new angle and that's where creativity comes in. That is how this  book has helped me to save the lives of others in crisis situations.	1999-01-03

Well, Luisah definitely walks her walk. She is a skilled and blessed practioner of the healing arts of Voudou and I highly recommend her book to any healer of any discipline. Luisah has tremendous gifts as a storyteller and anybody interested in learning the healing arts would gain wonderful lessons by sitting at her feet and listening to her tales and poems of magick.

This book is much deeper than any other self-help type book that I have ever read. The material is fresh and the perspective is totally unique. It is a right-brained styled, easy to read and  understand book. The secret to  the book seems to be that the exercises only appear to be simple. In  actuality, they are able to improve the skill of not only the beginner but  also the advanced student and even the master. In fact, the secret behind  this book seems to be its very simplicity because the book shows how  mastering the basics is really the key to success in any field from  business to professional sports.<br />This is truly a wonderful book. Lily is  a knowledgeable and understanding teacher who knows how to present and  teach advanced topics using simple exercises and concepts. All that the  reader needs is an open mind and patience.<br />Many of the advanced  techniques might be unfamiliar to the average reader but Lily's stories and  examples are detailed and if the reader is open-minded, it is easy to sense  the genuiness and authenticity of what she says.<br />The 100 or so exercises  consist of apparantly simple activities such as breathing and meditation  but as  any skilled practitioner in any field knows, it is the repeated  practice of the basics which leads to mastery.<br />One of the unique elements  of this book is that Lily reveals the skills of a full Chi Gung program  ranging from the beginner to the master. She openly stresses the basics and  only apparantly alludes to some of the most advanced skills, but in  actuality, she carefully weaves a pattern of writing that teaches the  reader the proper skill development at the proper time for their personal  situation. In other words, if someone is not ready to learn a skill, the  section may confuse them but when they are ready, they will see the lessons  jump off the page even though on first reading they may have seemed hidden  to the closed minded. If the reader reads carefully and takes the book as a  whole, the lessons for any level of attainment are indeed revealed.<br />This  book contains wonderful philosophical insights that can really help anybody  if one is willing to open their mind. Concepts such as visualization,  softness, and adaptability are shown to really work.<br />The book even gets  into some really advanced subjects like communicating with animals, healing  others, and picking up someone's thoughts. The neat thing is that Lily  shows how we all do that to some degree but she shows actual concrete  exercises anybody can do to increase their skill to their belief level. In  other words, Lily shows that the only limitations are actually  yourself.<br />Whether a person is a beginner or a master with decades of  experience, anybody can find life changing lessons in this book. In fact,  on the back cover two world renowned masters of chi kung, Wong Kiew Kit and  James MacRitchie, talk about how they feel the book can help anybody at any  level of experience.<br />I have looked at hundreds and hunderds of Qigong  books and out of all of those, this book is the perfect chi kung book for  anybody to have in their personal library because it shows things that no  other chi kung book in print reveals. It shows the Westerner how to adapt  the principles and lessons of Chi Gung to their lives.<br />I have practiced  chi kung for over 20 years and I highly recommend this book to everybody.  The information in the book changed my life. It helped me to realize that  it's not just the words in a book that are important but also the shape and  size of the book, the color of it, and even more importantly the hidden  information that is between the lines. This book itself, regardless of the  words it contains is a literal example of Chi Gung. Just holding this book  fills me with energy.k as a  whole, the lessons for any level of attainment are indeed revealed.<br />This  book contains wonderful philosophical insights that can really help anybody  if one is willing to open their mind.
