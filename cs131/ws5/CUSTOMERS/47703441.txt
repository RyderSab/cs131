It is -  presumably - a largely autobiographical work about a young South African (himself) leaving his native Cape Town for the UK in the hope that a life in London may finally wrest from him his ultimate destiny: to become a poet. The book brilliantly exposes the mind of this sensitive and somewhat listless youth, who searches for identity and meaning through a rare mix of poetry, computing, and a host of miscarried love affairs.<br /><br />Coetzee is a master of erudite objectivity, suspending outside judgement in a stream of succinct observations. His narrative runs its course with hardly an extraneous word, and, although the themes are often somber, he maintains an undercurrent of optimism. The result is both satisfying and memorable.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended. Read it and enjoy.	2005-07-29

To his most simple minded students he broadly taught on how not to hurt others and how to avoid suffering. To his more advanced students, he gave teachings on the 'emptiness' of all phenomena. To his most advanced students, however, he gave his highest teachings, namely methods and wisdom allowing the student to directly experience the nature of mind itself. These teachings are today known as the Tibetan traditions of Dzogchen and Chagchen (Mahamudra). They are tantric, i.e. the transform mind and 'weave' dharma into people's lives, and they are something completely different that the Therevada (Thai or Southern) Buddhist schools.<br /><br />(I am not even sure that all of the tantric teachings were ever fully written down, perhaps in many cases they were simply transmitted orally from teacher to student in a continuous chain up until now. But they are certainly in a very real and contemporary way part of modern Buddhism, in fact, they constitue Buddhist teachings of the highest possible level).<br /><br />The 'mahasiddhas' were the Indian yogis who carried the highest teachings on the nature of mind, ie. the tantric transmission which today only exists in Tibetan practice lineages, such as the Kagyu or Nyingma schools. And this book presents the stories surrounding these legendary figures.<br /><br />Because of the seemingly supernatural powers which come along with understanding fully the nature of mind, the mahasiddhas developed unusual abilities, some of which are represented in this book. However, the point of the book is not to show magic and miracles, nor was this the point of the mahasiddhas' work. The Buddha himself almost never carried out miracles because they are normally not conducive to the spiritual development of people. So, they were in a sense a by-product.<br /><br />I hope that gives an idea of the background onto which these accounts should be seen. And it is a very good and interesting book, especially for Buddhist practitioners.nt of people.

It is written in a simple style and refrains from deeper philosophical discussions, which is a good idea in order not to alienate the reader and discourage future Buddhists (raw Buddhist philosphy can get very involved if it is not coupled with practical advice). The Buddha emerges as a person of flesh and blood, not unlike ourselves, and the anecdotes and allegories are excellent. Read it and enjoy.	2005-06-27

I like the idea of the book, i.e. of presenting the philosphy of the Buddha in a both historical and contemporary light while drawing parallels to modern and ancient philosophers of the West. I also liked the personal touch (the story of the young author's struggle to find his place in the world and as a writer, etc) but sadly this part of the story gets hopelessly lost towards the middle of the discourse in a morass of socio-historical-political discussions that are all over the place and gives new meaning to the expression 'went off on a tangent'.<br /><br />From a Buddhist point of view the book is fairly accurate (most will forgive a slip or two), and I like the idea of portraying the Buddha as a man of flesh and blood. It does not detract anything from the value of his teachings, on the contrary. It is a in a sense a shortcoming the book that the author is not a practicing Buddhist, because he lends power to the idea that the Buddha was concerned about all sorts of socio-political-philisophical issues that I believe was of lesser importance to him. Despite the profundity of the teachings, I believe he was always searching for practical ways to work with mind in order to help beings rather than occupying himself with this sort of high-flying philosophical discourse.<br /><br />My suggestion would be to cut the book down to half, retain the personal parts, and focus more on the Buddha than on all sorts of history and extraneous philosphy that seems largely irrelevant to the thrust of the story.	2005-06-08

This book is a largely a transcript of some of the most important teachings he gave to Western students.<br /><br />Rinpoche present a traditional view, leaning heavily on the teachings of Gampopa's 'Jewel Ornament of Liberation', although he does present these in an easily understandable format (which is not always the case with Gampopa himself).<br /><br />The book is a lucid and very accurate account of the most important teachings of Vajrayana and Mahayana Buddhism. I think the material should be accessible to most, although be advised that it is always best to receive a 'living' transmission from a living lama.<br /><br />Also beware that Rinpoche cuts straight to the chase and does not package and gift-wrap the Dharma for the Western mind in the way that other excellent teachers - such as Ole Nydahl - do. Some things may be hard to swallow. But rest assured that there is still a lot of wisdom to be found in his words.	2005-05-25
US	47703441	R325R05WIDB6O6	0312424671	602974929	Small Island: A Novel	Books	1	19	40	N	N	Mediocre to poor at best	Sometimes I just don't get why novels become best sellers. This book is to me just plain poor, and this is why: The characters are not - perhaps with the slight exception of 'Queenie' - likeable or even interesting and they live lives of destitution and emotional decreptitude. Who feels good about reading about that? Books should elevate you to a higher level, either morally, emotionally, spiritually, or in some other way. This one is just plain depressing.<br /><br />But there are other problems. I honestly thought that the fashion ofr writing in dialect went out with 'Huckleberry Finn'. It's plain painful to read all the 'Jamaicanisms' and I don't see the point of continuously corrupting the English language. Perhaps a page or two, OK, we'll let it pass, but half of the book. No thanks, folks. It's repetitive, dull, and annoying.<br /><br />And then we come to the ending. For this I would like to quote the excellent James Gardner, who wrote the fine book 'The Art of Fiction'. He said something to the effect that some literary shortcomings must be attributed to 'a defect in the character of the writer'. I am sorry to be so harsh, but I think this must be the case here. After painstakingly mapping out racial tensions and abuses for pages on end, what does the main character do when she has a coloured child? Is there perhaps a dim hope of reconciliation, with the child as a symbol of better times to come?<br /><br />NO!!! She chickens out and gives it away to a black family! Even her pathetic, emotionally constipated and cuckolded husband is ready to give the kid a chance. But Queenie has come to the conclusion that black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet. In the 21st century that is the saddest of all conclusions in a book about racial inequality.<br /><br />This book just doesn't cut it. So unless you want to be depressed, read something else. Almost anything else.	2005-05-23

But that statement alone does not adequately account for his qualities, since many a Nobel laureate has churned out books that are hard work to read and often coolly intellectual. Jorge Amado is the exact antithesis of all that, and Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands shows the full span of Amado's remarkable mind. He is a story teller of the highest possible caliber with an imagination that bubbles over with delightful tales and a cast of characters of which you just can't get enough. I was sad to come to the last page of this book, and I am surely to read this superb novel again.	2005-02-27

But here is one point: part of the beauty of this masterpieces is that it - like all great works of art - functions on many levels. You can look at it as a criticism of Imperialism, as many have, although nowadays this traditional viewpoint seems stale. You may enjoy it for its masterful use of the English language; in fact, I can think of no better 'classical' tale form except perhaps that of Moby Dick. You may be startled by a short passage that strikes you as profound in its psychological richness. You can marvel at the strange character development where both Marlowe and Kurtz somehow remain elusive. And there is much more to ponder if you open your mind and simply allow the words to feed your imagination. Read it slowly, deliberately, and enjoy. It is doubtless one of the strangest works of English literature ever produced but perhaps also one of the best.	2005-01-25

The parallel plots of an early-1900s expidition, a modern scientist looking for fossilized pollen, and the ill-fated mission of some German war-ships converge nicely at the end, and that is structurally a very effective ploy. But you arguably have to wait a long time for it, and in the meantime there is a lot of rather dull character development. The 'modern' (1970s) part of the novel revolves around a rather average American woman scientist. Why not make her flamboyant, strong, hotblooded, sexy, or at least SOMETHING to make her come alive? She is just not exciting, sorry. The Victorian part of the plot boasts Elsa, who is a much more interesting person, but again predominantly rather dull. The most interesting character is perhaps the mentally disabled sister Alice. At least there is something unusual about her. Should cut the novel down to half length and inject some excitement.	2004-07-18

Scott Fitzgerald has been showered with praise and celebrated as one of the great authors of the century, and deservedly so. His language is remarkable because he uses quite an extensive vocabulary with the utmost precision, and is able to create vivid characters with a few succint phrases, a few strokes of the artist's brush. However, there are two things that strike me as odd in this novel: the &quot;prologue&quot;, that is, the first few paragraphs, which must have been written after the rest of the novel had been completed. This is a strange and ambiguous opening, and I am not sure that it is very good. And secondly the ending itself, because closure is brought about by introducing an accident (Daisy running over Tom's mistress). Somehow this is not satisfactory, at least not to me, because it avoids a final confrontation between the characters. Here Fitzgerald may as well have sent down a bolt of lightning to kill someone! People's fates in literature should be decided by themselves or by some other character, not by something beyond anyone's control. Why? Because that negates that character is fate and action; in fact, EVERYTHING in a novel should stem from character.	2004-04-19

It seems impossible that anyone could have survived trekking over the Himalayas in winter with no equipment other than a few rags for clothing. The rest of the book is a remarkable eyewittness account of Tibet and especially Lhasa just before the time of the Chinese invasion. Harrer paints a vivid picture of a lively and colourful Forbidden City (Lhasa), and his great love of the country and its charming people shines brightly through. Towards the end Harrer becomes a personal tutor of H.H. the 14th Dalai Lama and his account of his relationship with the only 14 year old leader of Tibet is endearing and touching. I enjoyed the book very much not only because of the topic matter but also because of Harrer's honest, tough, and yet deeply respectful and caring attitude toward Tibet and its people.	2003-11-03

It covers all the island's most fascinating aspects, including its geological history, the question of the origin of the Rapa Nui people, flora and fauna, and of course, most importantly, the archeological remains. The writers illustrate how a complex interplay between the natural environment and human behaviour created the island's unusual prehistory, including the demise of the statue cult. Although there are still many unanswered questions about the moai (giant statues) this book gives the qualified answers or at least suggestions as to how these things came to be. It wisely leaves behind all sorts of pseudo-scientific theories and bases its discussion on real archeological evidence, of which there today exists a substantial amount. The only unfortunate thing about the book is the slightly misleading title.	2003-08-27

It is strongly recommended that you study this and other books as much as possible before any visit to Easter Island, since it will give you a much deeper travel experience (for a lot of detail, specifically regarding the Rano Raraku quarry site, the rongorongo script, and local legends, have a look at another excellent publication, Routledge's 'The Mystery of Easter Island').

There are some good observations and proof of the use of solar astronomy in the orientation of many Ahu (Easter Island ceremonial sites), demonstrating clearly that the ancient Islanders knew something about astronomy. There are not, however, any wild and crazy theories, nor does the author elaborate or speculate at any length on the significance of these findings. In this sense the book is relatively dry.<br />One final important remark: This book is published by EI Foundation, a non-profit organization supporting the conservation of Easter Island and its amazing archeological heritage. It is also relatively old in layout and style, since the Foundation seems to me focused more of scholarly issues than in the area of marketing, which seems to me fair enough.	2003-07-11

Unfortunately the book is full of quite a lot of nonsense, including some very poor dialogue, and combined with the hard-nose realistic style, the end result is rather frigid. But my chief complaint is this: When someone calls his book 'Brazil' it should be safe to assume that the author has something important and truthful to say about the country. Updike's Brazil is stale and stereotypical, and none of the characters are even remotely believable as Brazilians. He misses the most important point about Brazil althogether: Its people are warm, caring, both passionate and compassionate. None of this comes through.

The book focuses on the exploration of the region as well as the wars, including that of Napoleon fighting the Mamelukes, and how he later was ousted by the English and the Turks. There are also many vivid and detailed descriptions of various tribes on the lower Nile, and, as always, Alan Moorehead has an instinct for colour, detail, and action.

It includes lots of fine illustrations, including photos and drawings, depicting the most important sites. It is definately a must-read for visitors to the island, or just for anyone interested in Easter Island and its strange history.<br /><br />I fancy the image of Katherine Routledge as a kind of female Indiana Jones. Certainly she was adventurous for a woman of the early part of the century; just getting to the island in a yacht ranks as a mildly swashbuckling achievement. There are also some references in the book that she had already been to East Africa, perhaps before the turn of the century, although I have been unable to find further information on this.	2002-11-22

In this book he recounts episodes from his fascinating vocation, mostly from around WW2, but the book is also a heartfelt memoir of a life long relationship with a dear friend and colleague. The stories include some excellent commentary his journalistic approach, and give a glimpse of his fantastic writing career, developing from a mildly uninspired Australian schoolboy into one of the finest documentary authors of the 20th century.<br /><br />Alan Moorehead has the uncanny ability to keep the reader's eyes glued to the pages. He is enormously satisfying and enjoyable to read. He must have been a person of great compassion and intelligence, and I imagine him being moved by a unflinching desire to search for and faithfully report the truth.	2002-11-22

I like the story, although it is not as dynamic as I would expect, knowing that the auther is John Irving. Generally I am a big Irving fan, and I think that 'A Prayer for Owen Meany' and 'Son of the Circus' are fantastic books, maybe even modern classics. This one doesn't quite measure up, it's just too rough around the edges. Still, it's enjoyable - just don't expect the same quality (but it puzzles me why Irving would release such a book when it is clearly so much less of a literary effort....??)	2002-07-26

It is a very worthwhile read.<br />Alan Moorehead is the best writer of documentary literature that I know of. He is a joy to read: informative, funny, entertaining, but still a shrewd intellectual with a profound understanding of history. I particularly enjoyed the exploration part, which brings to life such larger-than-life characters as Livingstone, Stanley, Burton, Speke, etc. These early explorers make even the most intrepid modern daredevils look like couch potatoes.<br />While reading some parts of the book one cannot help but draw parallels to current events. Many of the events recounted could as well have happened today - including horrific savagery in Central Africa, and moslem fanaticism in the Sudan. Perhaps we have not really come very far in 150 years.	2002-07-02

In the interim she tells of a life of horse racing and flying, including rescue missions, game scouting, and elephant hunting. Her stories include such personalities as Denys Finch-Hatton and Baron Bror Blixen (oddly, both were also intricately connected with the life of Isak Dinesen).<br />Beryl Markham writes a beautiful narrative, and seems to master a wide variety of literary techniques. The book ranges from poetic passages that appear conceived from a great height, to fast-paced, parge-turning hunting sequences. It is thoughtfully and very professionally structured. It seems strange that only a single work should emerge from an author of such remarkable ability.<br />Also remarkable is the fact that Kenya (or East Africa) has produced such a string of excellent women authors, e.g. Isak Dinesen, Beryl Markham, and Elspeth Huxley. Surely there must be something in that country that inspires creativity.	2002-06-25

This book is a vivid account of his life in Kora (Northern Kenya) and his lifelong dedication to nature conservation in Africa. The book is full of fascinating stories about lions, including the shooting of the movie Born Free, while he also paints an interesting but somewhat unflattering picture of Joy. This book is well worth the read for anybody interested African widlife. Sadly George Adamson was killed by marauding bandits close to his camp in Kora only shortly after publishing this book.	2002-06-11

I think this idea is fundamentally correct. It also contains other useful observations, generally derived from a physiological investigation of the hand and arm, how the various muscles perform various movements, etc. Many of these are also valuable.<br />To me the best part of this book are the diagrams of muscles, bones, and pictures of the resulting types of movements. I think sooner or later every pianist needs to look into these things. Also good are the ideas on how to improve practicing efficiency. Not all of them are applicable to all people, but certainly most will find at least some of them useful.<br />On the negative side, I find that the semi-mathematical approach taken (proving and disproving theorems) does not add much to the book. I suppose at best it gives some structure, but it also confuses the reader (at one point he manages to disprove both SITTING LOW and SITTING HIGH at the piano, so that leaves the student with ... exactly WHAT option???).<br />The idea in this book is not new. In fact, all of HANON, Cortot, Donanhyi, and others, advocate the same method of practice - if you read the instructions under the exercises. Donanhyi (the Hungarian virtuoso) produced a ton of nasty exercises to strengthen exactly the extensor muscle group. What IS new is the physiological reason for practicing in this manner, and this is something worthwhile knowing.<br />Overall I think the book may be useful for beginning to intermediate (adult) students that have very specific finger strength problems, or more advanced students that want to know more about the anatomy of the hand and arm.<br />I do, however, think that the price of this book is outrageous. It should be no more than 15 dollars. Also I think the title is misleading. Although it is potentially useful it does not contain a miracle cure for technical difficulties.es.	2002-06-10

In any event, it is solid in the sense that it provides some basic finger exercises that are still useful and presents some basic good advice. The commentary is probably quite correct but generally does not really reveal anything new, neither in content nor in presentation. Perhaps the best part of the book are the illustrations of various hand positions. At the end there is also a perhaps historically interesting article by Paderewski. For finger exercises, I think Hanon is better and more complete, and for a method as such, have a look at Seymour Bernstein's '20 Lessons in Keyboard Choreography'.	2002-06-10

This book is a classic, and for a good reason. It provides an excellent framework (for students at all leves) to achieve finger independence and dexterity. Part One essentially is 5-tone exercises, while Part Two continues with scale studies, and double stops. Hanon himself proposes that the whole volume be played through daily (after familiarizing oneself with the material). For most this is a bit over the top, but certainly 15-20 minutes a day will do all pianists a lot of good. Don't forget to read Hanon's comments carefully and follow his instructions.

Alan Walker tells the story of Liszt convincingly and captures the readers imagination. Enormous amounts of research has gone into this book - this is evident - but Walker avoids academic-style writing, and the book should attract a wide audience. However, for anyone interested in the nitty-gritty, there are plenty of footnotes and references. Perhaps the jist of the book is the depth and warmth of Liszt personality. Walker also succeeds in rectifying & correcting some of the myths sorrounding the legendary pianist.<br />Perhaps the only small minus is that Walker seems to fall in love with his subject. I suppose this is bound to happen. There is no disputing Liszt's impact on piano history, but still see such works as the Transcendental and Pagannini Studies as on slightly outside the core of the piano literature of today, while for example Chopin's Etudes are still right at the center. As a composer, I think Liszt is still more flash than content, although the technical challenges are enormous.	2002-05-10

All the pedaling examples are supported by score extracts, showing the exact suggested pedaling, and the various composers are discussed at length with regards to pedaling style &amp; performance practices. Remember that using the pedal (although it sounds simple!) is something not mastered well by many pianists, and it can be enormously effective in generating a wide spectrum of tonal effects.

On the rich backdrop of the African bush, Kuki tells of her life of adventure, including the colourful characters that became her family and friends.<br />Most memorable in the book are her heartbreaking experiences of losing her husband and her son, these events being vividly portrayed at length. Her valiant struggle to live through these tragedies and carry on with her life lends to us a sense of hope in the face of great adversity.<br />It would not be fair to compare this book to 'Out of Africa' and other classic African tales, since it is more a personal account of a life rather than a literary effort. The best part of the book is clearly the chapters on the death of her son, which are terribly moving, and at times chilling in their attention to detail and their realism. A little bit of criticism: sometimes her habit of packing a lot of adjectives into her sentences can make the book a bit tiring to read, and makes her style at times a bit mannered.<br />Overall the book is the account of a remarkable life. It is well worth reading, especially for Africa-philes.	2002-03-18

Gardner's fundamental principle is to view all fiction as a 'fictional dream', and this leads to a lot of very useful advice and criticism. He goes on to discuss various more philosophical as well as practical, technical issues in a superbly informative and entertaining manner, with lots of excellent examples from very good literature.

Dover, Mineola, NY 11501, Us)	Books	3	3	4	N	N	A picture to match the music	A worthwhile and interesting book. It is a most useful thing is to put a face on the names that are so well known, and to see how different the great masters were, not only musically, but physically. The only unfortunate thing is that there are only a one picture of each, could have been interesting to see some younger pictures, a greater variety, etc. of some of the more famous names.	2001-05-11

This book contains a methodical and straight-forward instruction in the key principles of expressive piano playing, and the fundamentals are the best that can be found in modern piano literature. The salient point is that Mr. Bernstein uses simple and effective means to demonstrate how to achieve control. In addition, it is noticable that a section on the piano mechanism itself is included. This is something that most pianists and teachers have very little knowledge about - but they certainly should! We can thank Seymour Berstein for his efforts, may he continue to produce excellent piano instructional literature.	2001-05-04

There are a few problems. Firstly, the references are organized poorly, I would like to have seen listings under for example 'piano technique', 'interpretation', 'biographies','piano history', etc. Instead it is just one very long alphabetical list with some limited cross-references at the end that are not practical to use. Secondly, a lot of references are to quite obscure. Finally, there is no advice at all, it is purely a listing, and thus no value is added by the author. I think the idea of the book is excellent, but it needs revamping!	2001-04-29

I am biased, having spent time in Kenya, but even so it must carry universal appeal for all. It is in essence a bittersweet love story, a search for the most meaningful life. But also remember that this is a far cry from the reality of 'Baroness' Blixen's life in Africa - the truth is much less romantic. None the less, it is a pity that Karen Blixen never received the Noble Prize for her work, even though Mr. Hemingway thought she should have - in place of himself!	2001-03-28

It is a good reference and interesting read - at times.  The only drawback it is not very well written from an English literature point of view, it could definately be smoother, although there are lots of interesting descriptions and discussions. The second drawback is that Mr. Dubal is a die hard Horowitz fan, perhaps a little too much. No body can argue against Horowitz qualities, but it needs to be toned down a little in a book of this nature.	2001-03-28

For the advanced student, it should be relatively basic. It is very well organized, and presents many fundamentals of piano technique. My biggest problem with the book is that it is a little dry, i.e. does not really inspire. For that, turn to Neuhaus and Bernstein. I also strongly disagree with the concept of the 'hand drop' technique (by pure gravity alone). This is nonsense, nobody plays like that, although they might THINK that they do  - which is altogether something different!	2001-01-07

One is Neuhaus' 'The Art of Piano Playing', and the second is this one. Mr. Bernstein not only demonstrates a profound understanding of the challenges facing all aspiring and accomplished pianists, but provides invaluable advice on how to tackle all of these. It is an absolute must. You won't regret it - I learned more in 2 hours of reading that in months, perhaps years, of practicing.	2001-01-07

It should in fact be standard reading for all piano students and professionals alike, and even to some extent qualifies as a reference on artistic piano playing. It is excellently well written, entertaining, funny, inspiring, and very educational. It is well worth reading many times, since the profundity of some of the advice given actually needs digestion and experimentation at the piano to fully grasp. It is a crime that this book is out of print.	2000-12-11

The content relates much to the method of analyzing scores for the purposes of understand structures, and aiding memorization. There are other sections as well, which are mildly more interesting. To get true and solid advice, go for Art of Piano Playing by Henrich Neuhaus.	2000-12-11

Some of the suggestions are common sense, but it certainly helps to read these things every so often. I strongly believe that Ms. Bruser's method works. In fact, it is not so much a method, as some advice on how to practice in a different, more enjoyable, and more effective manner. I do believe - also from experience - that a lot of hours spent practicing are wasted if not accompanied by the right mental (and physical) approach.	2000-12-11

It contains everything from the physiology of the inner ear, the brain, to Beethoven, and the theme from the Pink Panther; scattered facts with no coherency what so ever. It presents no new facts, and not even any new ideas. The author never asks himself the question 'Why is this important?' For example: It is mentioned that the reason why an interval is dissonant is because it falls within a socalled 'critical band' of hearing. That might be interesting trivia, but does it add anything to our understanding of music? I think not. At one point the author writes 'Fortunately you don't need to understand the brain to be able to use it'. Exactly! So what is the point of this book? Music is an emotional and spiritual experience. The author has once and for all proven that looking for musical enlightment via a pseudo-scientific discourse as impossible as trying to locate the human soul by brain surgery, and as meaningless.	2000-10-05

Anyone who tries to play Chopin or has an amibition to do so, should read this. It goes straight to the heart of Chopins entire musical philisophy, and gives not only insight into the artist himself, but solid and sound advice on practicing, technique, and interpretation.
