I was not sure that I would enjoy reading this book when I selected because I wanted it to be at least slightly believable. The story is about a young girl named Alanna who wants to become a knight.

After reading the frist book I could not wait to read the read the next one. I have been getting the books from the public library, I had been waiting a while to get it and I though I was going to pull my hair out waiting. I read it in two days because I was so hooked on it. I do think that Tamora Pierce could have left out the romance but it does show that Alanna does have a loving side. If you enjoyed the first book I do encourage you to read this but if you haven't read the first one I do suggest to start with the first one because it can become slightly confusing.	2002-02-24

After reading the first three books in the Lionness series  and I was sick of waiting to get the fourth from the library,I began to took for more books by this author. I came across this series and brought the first three home. One thing that I stress to everyone is that if you haven't read all of the Lionness series or you are planning on reading it DO NOT READ THIS BOOK! The book is set right after Alanna's adventure so it ends up telling how the last lionness book ends!<br />The book is about a girl named Kel (Keladry or Mindlan) who is determinded to become a knight. After the discovery that Alanna is a girl they decide that if a girl can keep up with everyone the boys then she has just as much right to be a knight. Unfortunately Kel has been put on probation. She is not an official Page, but if the training master thinks that she is good enough by the end of the year she can become and official Page.<br />I was slightly sceptical when beginning this book because I did not think that anyother book could measure up to the Lionness Series. Boy was I wrong!	2002-02-24
