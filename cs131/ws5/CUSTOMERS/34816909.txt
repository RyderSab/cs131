Hundreds of Questions You'd Only Ask a Doctor After Your Third Martini	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Enormously intelligent, entertaining and funny.	This is a very clever, entertaining and enlighting book and it also happens to be extremely witty in it's delivery, all the more likely therefore that you will absorb what it has to teach. It is packed to the gills with all manner of information that amounts to vexing, medical quandry, the kind of stuff we have all been perplexed by and never really had a satisfactory answer to or indeed dared to get an answer to!<br /><br />It's basic premise is to explore and explode myth and overcome the tiresome influence of embarassment and politeness in getting answers to questions so long deemed silly and rude.<br /><br />It's a truly fascinating book and we all know we would never have asked the questions in the book without emerging a little pink in the cheeks!<br /><br />Only one problem remains in a society still influenced by victorian values, how to read a book with such a title on public transport? I suggest a temporary cover of innocuos wrapping paper!	2005-08-26

E F Benson's characters are just sublimely and achingly funny, it seems with Mapp and Lucia he was aiming to scrutinise and satarise the nosensical heirarchy and rivalry of bored and over privelaged upper middle class folk.<br /><br />This aspect of the British Class system was one he knew well and which was breathing it's last in the times in which Mapp and Lucia live, witness the somewaht irritating coldness with which the Ladies treat their Maids, Drivers and Shop staff.<br /><br />Lucia is the dominant character, lithe, fashionable and razor sharp while Mapp is clumsy, mumsy and opts for bulldog tactics.<br /><br />The two appear in many novels, Lucia more often and one cannot help wonder if she was based on a Lady whom Benson was ever so slightly in love with, but here they meet for the first time, as Lucia moves to \\"Tilling\\" for the summer in Mapps rented out home \\"Mallards\\". The array of colurful charcters they surround themselves with and draw into their delighfully bitchy and cunning war agaisnt each other, are of equal delight, of particualr note are Quaint Irene and Georgie. Perhaps seen as little more than bohemian in their day but doubtless these characters would now be seen as obviously Lesbain and Gay; with the former being in love with Lucia. A daring inclusion in Benson's time but subtle and beautifully inclusive one.<br /><br />Fans of these deliciously naughty pair should see the 1986 TV series which is available on DVD. Geraldine McKewan (of current Miss Marple fame)is petite, pretty, acid and simply perfect as Lucia while Prunella Scales (Cybil of Fawlty Towers) brings Miss Mapp to dusty, dowdy and bullish life! Excellent stuff!<br /><br />The series was filmed in Rye in Sussex, home town of Benson, it used many locations close to his home (Lamb House), such as the lovley houses of Watchbell Street (My favourite being No 11 which was used as Godiva's house) and \\"Twistevens\\" shop on Mermaid Street, actually a Tea Room in reality.<br /><br />WELL WORTH A VISIT! Literature fans may also wish to know that Lamb House was once home to American novelist, Henry James before Benson's time. One can also visit Benson's Grave in the town. Benson was Lord Mayor of Rye for a while and the river \\"Tilling\\"-ton flows through the town.ns may also wish to know that Lamb House was once home to American novelist, Henry James before Benson's time.

This novel is pacey, racey, interesting to a fault and truly frightening at times.<br /><br />I adored the fact that it incorporates so much \\"actual\\" fact and historical development as part of it's foundation; amazingly it does so from several distinct points in time and weaves these times together in such a way as to make them both stand alone events and intimately connected happenings.<br /><br /> The style is part modern chiller, thriller in the style of Rankin, Herbert and King but equally there is the feel of the complex gothic horror genre about it and echoes of complex old style detectice novels in styles such as Shelley, Stoker, Christie and Conan Doyle. Amazing that one novelist could incorporate so much detail, so much pathos and drama and so much of other genres while creating one that is also entirely her own. Cracking stuff and a novelist to watch, this was my first exposure to her work and I am certainly keen to see more.	2005-07-29

It is difficult not to muse on these ideas in much the way the Author must have in the creation of them. The ideas presented here are worthy and sensible and the book speaks as much of connection and barrier dissolution as it does of the creation of new barriers, developing \\"split\\" factions and the dangers of this way of life. The book is kind of half modern commentry and half cautionary tale, and it is much needed for the Western fashion for barrier dissolving and increasing the pace and speed of life has also created the loopholes which lay in waitng for exploitation by our detractors and enemies.<br /><br /> I didn't feel, as some reviewers patently did, that the oversight of presenting the developing world view, was in anyway devisive; moreover it feels like a deliberate exclusion and a necessary follow up book must surely come from this.<br /><br /> Essentially I felt Freidman's work more a philosophising of modern life more than a fact finding mission. I wonder if the Authors critics and detractors have missed this point and mistaken one journey for another?<br /><br /> Whatever you think, this book may well have started a process that the way of life it describes has left no room for, that is the opportunity to stand back and question the pros and cons, for this reason it is an important and perhaps revolutionary work.	2005-07-24

I could not help but to read this book as an uniniated but interested foriegner and my intial feeling was that it had the appearance of being another cheap, brash listing expose which takes wounding jibes at the rich and famous because as targets they are rather in the position of sitting ducks. Not so however, what I found was an author who essentially has a problem with the myriad of ways these people undermine the essential qualities, culture and gratifacation of what is to be American. This is not to say I agree with all he said nor all his chosen candidates.<br /> Still, what he does appears to be reasoned, honest, pride driven and is delivered in a non-evangelical way.<br /> As a person \\"outside of the loop\\" but interested because our countries have perhaps the closest bond of any two nations on the planet, I was heartend that someone cared enough to stick their neck out and see beyond the hype. Even if, like me, you do not agree with all the assessments here you cannot help but to allow this thought provoking work to challenge or enrich your own thought processes and assessments.<br />If the reviews here on the Amazon site form a concensus, then he has done an overall good a job as I felt he had.<br />I wonder if the Author would care to fix his gaze on the UK next time? We too need some intelligent expose like this aimed at Government, The Royal Family and the Celebrity culture.<br /> A very worthy and brave book which should become an essential historical reference even if the opinion formed is a little wild at times.	2005-07-21

Modern readers approaching Austen for the first time are often underwhelmed by the events and the pace of the drama, not entirely difficult to understand given that we need to have our drama so upfront we can smell it these days! Equally just about anything goes in drama today.<br /><br /> There are few taboos and drama reaches us in a multi media fashion. In Austen's time taboo and social order was a plenty and well structured, men and women had distinct roles as did the classes. Society was subtly cruel and unforgiving in it's snobbery and comment upon this was unwelcome. Place these novels in that context and you will love them for Austen is clever and subtle at her sending up and fun poking at this order. Her novels have a sense of justice in which the good triumph and the underhand and sly come undone, whatever their class or station. These kind of novel conclusions seem simple and ideal but it is how she sends up the social order of her time that is her true writIng gift, her tongue was always wedged firmly in her cheek and she can astound, even today, with her wry wit and biting sarcasm. An excellent book and representation of her career.	2005-07-17

Thomas was a skilled and lyrical writer and captures much of the musicality of Welsh speaking people in his works. While he is interesting to read it can be a trail for those not familair with Welsh culture, particularly now as the Welsh culture he speaks of is pretty much dead and gone. His musical poetic skills are brought beautifully to life when he reads to you and this is the only way to \\"do\\" Under Milk Wood, written as a play for radio but essentially an elongated poem of early 20th century Welsh life as Thomas himself knew it. Contrary to some beliefs expressed in reviewing this item, the play is complete, all the complex and strange villagers are present as are their stories.<br /><br /> What Thomas does best is to guide your imagination into his world and this set allows you to experience his work in the best way read by the man himself.	2005-07-11

The book follows the lives of three beautiful and unique women whose complex lives seem to be studied and dissected by a vicious stalker and serial killer.<br /><br /> It is dramtically tense, enormously emotive and even desperately depressing. One cannot deny the strength of characterisation, the pace and emotional intensity of the plot and the staggering awkwardness of peicing the evidence together to reveal and catch the killer. One feels enormously anxious, paranoid and mistrusting of some, and at times all, of the subsidury characters, in much the way the women do as their lives disintergrate. In all a very clever novel but a sad comment in part that such plots with huge resonanace to modern life, sit at the uncomfortable junction between being informative narration and parasitic entertainment.<br /><br /> I don't feel entirely comfortable with novels that describe such hidious crime, particularly crime towards and agaisnt women, and yet something about this kind of work draws to me to feel it has some educational role. That I find at once enlightning and terrifying, maybe that is the best we can hope for in such work.

This book is based on a mass observation, sociological study carried out in England immediately after WW2. It focuses on the dairy entries of 5 random individuals, 2 women and 3 men, all from different backgrounds, walks of life, parts of Country and age groups. The entries offer a fascinating insight into the life and times of Post War England, an often overlooked period in history which saw continued poverty and austerity, political disillusionment and the beginnings of radical social changes and beliefs that the war had begun and which gathered momemtum at this time, forming the foundations of the modern UK.<br /><br /> Real, engaging, utterly fascinating and compelling. You love and sometimes loath the participants, B.Charles is quite a hostile, fascist and snobbish antiques dealer. My personal favourite was Maggie Joy Blunt, a modern single girl trying to make her way in the world as a writer. Really fasicinating social history.	2005-07-01

Woolf's work is always more of a journey than a read and as such, as with all journeys, you need to stop and take stock along the way to make sense of your experiences, digest what is and learn to love and to appreciate it. The simplist and tiniest of actions are examined in microscopic detail so as to capture the finer feeling of the moment and what it is to be alive, here this concept is fully realised juxtaposed against terrific loss and the emotion of carrying on into newer less certain times and with assumed constants gone.<br /><br /> Enriching and beautiful. Once you reach her pitch, Woolf is a joy to read.	2005-07-01

Although there would be some difficulty in using this book in the US, some drugs do not share exact trade and official names, the problem would be minimal as even those drugs named differently are done so very subtly.

An enormously engaging and highly explanatory work which details ancient greek religious beliefs and the works of the major playwrights and poets alike.

What is remarkable is these stories really were the first kind of documented evidence of humanity making sense of it's exsistance, purpose and meaning. A phenomena which has been occuring in revised and multi-cultural forms ever since.<br /><br /> The Myths are surprising, intelligent and familair at once, they are remarkable informative and have much contemporary resonance.

This novel speaks with cultural clarity of the attitudes and actions of a large portion of the US, some of which still persist today. The point of the novel is to explore the awakening of a child's mind in understanding the adult world and being guided on the truth and deceptions of humanity by a pivotal and herioc parental figure. Slowly paced, it beautifully reflects the dangerous pace of rotting minds and attitudes in the depression era, the story of Tom Robinson's court case and treatment by the majority of the Townsfolk is beautifully reflected by the Children's treament of and fascination with, Boo Radley. The Finch's are a fine family and you will ache for a Father like Atticus.

Anyway I bought it for her and we read it together. I can see why it captured her imagination and had the class captivated, it really is a lovely little book and written in the classic style of good Children's literature. I remember the Author in her other guise as an Actress, a career in which she is extremely accomplished, her writng skills are every bit as good and honed, this dear little book has a lot to tell Children about being unfraid of individuality. The central characters, a Penguin and an Eagle, are unhappy living the life they are supposed to and try and find the life they want instead. I pray the rights are never sold to Disney, they would ruin it's subtle sentiment with syrup and silliness.

I was drawn to this novel because I had been asked for the author's Childrens work by my Neice and was very impressed with it's tyle and integrity. If an Adult wants to read a book for Children and enjoys it, it bodes exceedingly well for the Author.<br /><br /> The fact that I am also familair with the Authors work as an Actress intrigued me further, in England she was in a long running tv comedy series about a female surgeon with an acid tongue and biting wit, \\"Surgical Spirit\\". She was also recently the Baroness in the West End production of, \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\".<br /><br /> As a first novel this is a powerful beginning and will attract fans of Minette Walters, Patricia Cornwell or Lynda La Plante.<br /><br />Focussing largely on the underhand goings on in a high flying marriage, it has forensic character study and gripping plot development. A really intelligent and engaging read, I hope Ms Macauliffe continues her writing career, she really has a sound and engaging aptitude for it.	2005-06-12

And it is wit with a dark, naughty and twisted edge which does not have to work hard to illustrate it's point, it does exactly what you would expect of the title and why would you look if you felt as though you would be offended?<br /><br /> I believe this kind of base, juvenille humour is needed by us all at time's. The hilarity of the forbidden and taboo subject is intensely and achingly funny sometimes. Surely everyone remembers wanting to howl with laughter when being heftily scalded as a child?<br /><br /> To ignore we have such base instincts is to deny being human and assume superiorty over ones peers, quite hilarious in itself really, it is afterall, JUST A BOOK!<br /><br /> This book is wickedly funny and a huge \\"pick-me-up\\" with no real malice intended! To the book's detractors and disapprovers I say, Lighten up folks! NO ACTUAL CATS WERE HURT IN THE MAKING OF THE BOOK!!	2005-04-12

Mr Slater is a genius and I believe his cookery philosophy is also immensley important since he preaches about the physical and mental health benefits of putting love and care into food.<br /><br /> He is a culinary genius and he is extremely funny too, a very engaging and witty writer. Fans of his cookery work should also check out his Autobiography, \\"Toast\\", a VERY enjoyable read!	2005-04-08

A first glance I expected to find a garderner's manual in minature, but not so, I should have known better knowing Phaidon as I do.<br /><br /> A fabulous little book which chronicles fabulous and famous gardens worldwide, ancient and modern, tropical to traditonal, endlessly interesting and inspirational even it does not give planting and planning tips and shcemes.<br /><br /> I know I'm British and gardening is in my blood but this delightful little book has universal appeal!	2005-04-02

If you have known or know Leicester, Leicestershire or Rutland then you must have this book!	2005-03-20

The ideas within are varied in both decorative style and plausibility. However you cut it some the ideas just look cheap and silly and are really not worth the effort.<br /><br /> A good proportion of the ideas are for those on a tight budget, so it is a very useful book for young people going it alone for the first time or those studying design and wanting to explore some different ideas for their portfolio.<br /><br /> The projects are very bargain basement though and this shows with some of them, the \\"Cowboy Chair\\" and \\"Spacebed-head\\" are truly ridiculous and awful!	2005-03-19

Many of the author's detractors have commented on his lack of focus on Lesbianism, feminism, race and class differences. But then surely the book aims to present a potted history of British gayness in the 20th century, to that end all the famous names are here, Quentin Crisp, Radcliffe Hall etc. I don't think you can be critical of what this book fails to take into account, to me it seems to be a book aimed at normalising gay life for a straight and uninformed audience (the book evolved at a highly interesting time for the political climate in Britain, 1997, the end of 18 years of Conservative rule and the possibility that the new socialist Government might overturn the vile and comtemptable section 28, instigated by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980's and responsible for the marginalisation of gay life for over a decade; the legislation of 28 legally encouraged homophobia).<br /><br /> It seems Jivani is trying to speak to the uninitiated and try to repair some of the damage of section 28. I for one am glad he avoids the class issue, it is an issue that so easily obscures the point of British history texts and it would here for he is trying to speak of the commonality of gay experience in spite of class or race. On the subject of race, yes it is not highly explored here but Jivani is a gay asian man and as time goes on I have every confidence he may yet give us a book on that subject. This book is a really informative read and I wish some of it's gay readership were not so ready to judge it harshly, think of it's intended task first; please.	2005-03-19

This is a highly sensible and helpful text that aims to address a lot of the dietry and digestive problems that have become a common part of modern day life. Don't assume it is about loosing weight, the word \\"diet\\", seems to have come to mean that and yet it so much more of an embracing word. This is just a good book about the most sensible kind of medicine, food and good food at that.<br /><br /> It should be in every home and in every Doctor's consulting room right next to their prescription book!	2005-03-19

The story essentially centres on the competition between two men for love of one woman, but ultimately each of them abuses her with their own notoins of ownership. It seems to focus on the nature by which we can kill those we love with strangulating beliefs of ownership and imposing standards of behaviour which kill the spirit of the being we direct them at.<br /><br /> Given that \\"ownership\\" was a strong theme in Victorian marriage, this book was being ultimately brave but it seems the audience at the time of it's release, revelled in it's horror form a gothic point of view, a hugely popular novel movement at the time.<br /><br /> It has taken time and changes in attitudes to see the themes beyond the story. This book still has enormous contempary resonance and is a disturbing but important read.	2005-03-18

Because it makes such a striking and frankly beautiful change to here of the later generation dealing with contempary issues. So often it is the belief that sex and sexuality are not the remit of the older genrations and if they are then we don't want to hear about it. Juska blows that myth with bold and engaging work, her narrative is strong and delicious and her journey life affirming and beautuful. It is the only book I have ever read that has made look forward to my twilight years!	2005-03-18
US	34816909	R35C7JIQS3AIB8	0714839841	612893177	The House Book	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Another winner from phaidon.	In the best tradition of the phaidon culture books, this one explores architectural styles.<br /><br />It covers most periods and is eclectic in terms of style and the cultural heritage of the buildings. It also manages to present a huge time span of works, though the focus is on the boom years of architectural styles and changes (from the Victorian era onwards).<br /><br /> Inspires plans for lots of day trips for culture vultures or indeed travels abroad. Very interesting, I imagine there was not quite the struggle to overcome snobberies with this book as there must have been with this books family members, Art, Modern Art, Fashion and Photography.	2005-03-16

Again a story of a downtrodden orphan, Sophie and he journey to freedom and potential with the aid of her BFG, Big Freindly Giant. The pair don't exactly start off on the right foot, but exploration, learning, laughter and love ensue. A lovely book which was actually written for Dahl's dear Grandaughter, Sophie who is now the very beautiful supermodel Sophie Dahl, (YSL Opium perfume ad a few years ago/ and famous for not being extremely thin like most models!) who says dreams like Roald Dahl's don't come true!	2005-03-13

I don't quite know how Phaidon manage to do it but they do.<br /><br /> They take highly contentious subjects which are celebrated and villified in equal measure and condense then into an accesible book form which is essentially an \\"all you could want to know\\" format.<br /><br /> This should cheapen the subject and attract heaps of critiscm, but it doesn't, it invites access to the uninitaited and invites all round praise and no accusations of watering down important subjects.

Dorothy Parker was a great writer and a great social observant who now gives us a clear window into the past. Her wit is biting and at it's best in this collection, favourite reads are for the individual to decide, however, for me, as well as cheering me up with her razor sharp observation and almost cruel wit. Parker also saddens me for her wit must have been based on the cynacism of one who viewed her life as overindulged and wasted by circumstance, as a wealthy woman and as a woman in her time. Reading her is alawys like laughing with a red hot tear in your eye, for her work is as much an insight into her soul as it is to her lifetime and lifestyle.	2005-03-12
US	34816909	RUFTEDYBF7NHA	0140374248	893523493	James and the Giant Peach	Books	5	2	2	N	N	My first reading "love".	I adored this book when I was a child, I begged my Dear departed Grandmother to buy me it for my birthday and, as always, she didn't let me down! It is a magical an entrancing tale for children but tinged, as Dahl always is, with a frightening darker side. But this is Dahl's magic at it's best, it proves Children can handle the horror and indeed need it, to develop a sense of themselves in a cruel world. Generations of Kids have loved this stuff!<br /><br /> There are not too heavily disguised tales of overcoming oppresion, fighting prejudice and triumphing over evil doing in this book; all excellent themes for young minds to explore and they can do so in a world that is fantasticly entising and not in the least dull.<br /><br /> James has a magical journey of escape from tyranny and finds love in great and different friends. It's a lovley, lovely book, don't just buy it for a Child, buy it for yourself!	2005-03-12

Essentially a collection of tributes from a wide ranging slice of the actresses peer group, all of whom adore her and admire her skill terribly. I really enjoyed learning a little more about Dame Judi, as famous as her face is, she is afterall still somewhat enigmatic. The writing is varied because of it's shared authorship but as such makes the book more challenging.<br /><br /> This is not a celebratory style that would work for anyone famous, the very fact it focuses on Dame Judi makes it more than tolerable. Had it been other stars it may not have been so easy to take nor to read. But it is lovely, like a few days in the company of Lionel and Jean (As time goes by).	2005-03-12

Nash's work is too often regarded as light and meaningless; admittedly some of the work is very much \\"of it's time\\" now, but it is largely rich, diverse, insightful and wonderfully clever.<br /><br /> The rhymes are complex and intriguing and form great volumes of biting social comment. They are deliciously constructed and achingly funny at times.<br /><br />Yet he seems to be an almost forgotten \\"Children's\\" poet, even if this were the case, are not some writers for Children so good as to far exceed the virtues of those who write for adults?<br /><br /> Rhold Dahl, J K Rowlins, Lewis Carrol and E Nesbitt spring to mind, Nash needs also to be on that hallowed list.<br /><br /> He really should be regarded as an American National treasure!	2005-03-12

This book celebrates the life of British actor John Thaw through the eyes of actress Shelia Hancock, who also happened to be his wife for 28 full years. I expected this book to be sad and greif stricken but there is only appropriate levels of sadness here. Hancock celebrates her husband's life with extraodinary candor and sensitivity. She leaves no stone unturned but in doing so is not muck raking nor commercialising her loss. She is every bit as brave and gutsily excising of her own greif and pain. I think Sheila really HAD to write this to tie the threads of her enormous loss together, John had put himself out on limb to be with her and she had done the same to keep him, on more than one occassion. In loosing him to cancer she had to find a way to explain the loss to herself and to John's public, he was a terribly adored actor and regarded as a national treasure. She explains everything beautifully here and I hope it helped her as much as I and others have enjoyed understanding them both in her work.	2005-03-12

These books are absolute, cast iron and definitive insights into the movie world, whether Actors, Directors or Producers.<br /><br /> To call it a dictionary is almost to do it a major diservice.<br /><br /> Thomson aims to give a well crafted slice of punchy prose for each entry and somehow manages to capture the very essence of each persons attributes and skills (or lack of!)<br /><br /> He has a way of describing people that is worhty of a moments contemplation and leaves you half feeling that that is ofcourse the perfect description and wondering why you could not have thought of it yourself. Even his more unflattering entries are spot on, often I had just bumbled along thinking someone's work reasonable ok, that is until Thomson had me evaluating the person in awe and being regretful for what I had missed or wondering how I had managed not to notice such a weighty lack of effort or ability. Brilliant, just brilliant.	2005-03-05

Well researched, easy to use, perfect for the the seasoned cook or novice alike. She even advices you on what to buy in the way of cookware, a big boon to many a wedding list!<br /><br /> It is a touch evangelical, Delia is always prone to giving you advice like a stern School Marm (so it feels like something you have to do rather than might do!) and this is reflected in her slighty dry, bossy and occasionalyy dreary writing, think cooking with a St Trinian's Head mistress if you have never seen Delia on TV. But I have to hand it to her, if you follow her recipes to the letter YOU WILL NOT GO WRONG!<br /><br /> Just curtail the cookware shopping list or do as she says and get a MUCH bigger Kitchen!	2005-03-04

The hard fact is you have to cut the fat, increase the fruit and vegatables and do some working out, it's the only safe way to lose weight and improve your health.<br /><br /> And to anyone who thinks it has no side effects the most immediate is the worse!

The first book in this series was not nearly as good as this one! Matt James, the author of both and extremely good garden designer really hones his craft in this book.<br /><br /> The books are essentially about amalgamating the concepts of gardening and design, so Matt not only aims to give you knowledge of plants, shrubs and trees, but also asks you to consider how you might use them, how they can fulfill your gardening and lifestyle needs. He designs everything from the slighest balcony of a flat to sizeable victorian terrace gardens. The principles are of use outside of the UK, people want a natural life in urban spaces the world over and this demonstrates our innate need for the outdoor life! I note this page asks for applicants for Matt's next graden makeover TV series and I would encourage anyone outside the UK, who is looking for a garden design and makeover, to apply. This Bloke REALLY knows what he is doing and what he is taking about and his writing style reflects his personality well, (at least if his TV self is real!) he is passionate but relaxed and easy going. Maybe I'm biased too but I think British Gardeners are amongst some of the best!	2005-03-04

Matt James, the author is a gardener who specialises in constructing interesting and functional small urban garden spaces.<br /><br /> He really encourages you to think about what you want from your space in terms of both design and planting. He considers notions like tranquility, entertainment, screening, wildlife encouragement. He will ask you to consider planting and it's effects both short term, seasonally and long term (it made me rethink what a wrongly placed silver birch might be doing to my foundations!) A sound little book, I would urge to get hold of the TV series if you can, to bring his ideas to life. Great for any City dwellers seeking greenery.	2005-03-03

This book is by far his best work and is filled with restless longing and dissapointment, a sexually journey of mass comparison and appeal.<br /><br /> These are not so much \\"gay\\" novels as incredibly important \\"modern\\" novels, this book has the hallmark of a classic.	2005-02-28

It is without doubt that Ms Hughes is great historian, knows her subject as well as it is possible to do and has researched Elliot thoroughly from a range of complex and interesting sources.<br /><br /> I would have personally expected the book to be a little tidier and to have greater flow and life than it does. I was not looking for sensation and fibs, Elliot's life was unconventional enough to set the pages alight; but they are instead rather damp. Still you cannot fail to learn much of this great Woman and the inspiration for her great works, from this weighty work.	2005-02-28

It picks up William's story from precisely the point at which you leave it in \\"The Road to Nab End\\".<br /><br /> The early part of the story I found interesting, it certainly demonstrates that poverty in the early 20th century England was a nation wide issue, amongst the working classes; you could mistakenly believe it just effected the north had you only read the first book. William's journey through education and on to Oxford University, delighted me. But the book is politics heavy and if the history of the Labour movement is not your cup of tea, then you might find you lose your way a touch with this book. Keep on though, it is worth it, it just lacks the evocative magic of it's for runner for the most part. It does cleverly highlight pre-WW2 politics. Some of the early stories capture the old magic, particualry William's cyclehunt for his lost love in driving snow!	2005-02-26

I simply wanted to learn more about the ladies life, work and add shine to my memories of \\"Nan\\".<br /><br /> While I was not looking for cheesy and sickly sentimental representations of Miss Roger's life, I did not expect to find the book to be so scathing, critical and frankly, bitchy.<br /><br /> It was nasty to the point of horribly dismissive and cruel. The photography is lovely, it could not fail to be, she was a beautiful woman. The written word here is just mean and spiteful and it assumes all her achievements to be accidental folly or ruthlessly aquired.<br /><br /> Morley has such an axe to grind, but why he does is best known to himself since he never discloses the source of his disdain.  I hope no author is as cruel to the memory of his Father, the British actor Robert Morley, as he is to Miss Rogers. The only postive thing about this book is that you won't want to buy a Morley book again, and he has produced many on other stars.<br /><br /> Biographers can be hard to take at best, making a living by picking over the lives of others so disrespectfully, when they do so nastily it just smacks of the worse kind of envious resentment and inadequacy. As a boigrapher, Morley is as awful as Andrew Morton, the awful man who picked over Princess Diana's life both before and after her death. These people are like verbose vultures.	2005-02-26

We have been nagged and nagged by our 9 year old neice to supply Tracey Beaker books at every Birthday and Christmas Celebration since she was 6. Like the good Uncle and Aunt we like to be, we have obliged each request, but this year I was encouraged to read to her from the books and I have to say I can see why children cannot get enough of Tracey and the kids from the, \\"dumping ground\\". Tracey is one of several unwanted children living in a London care home in contemporary times, the care home has the dubious title of \\"dumping ground\\" from the children and most hope to be adopted some day or to be rescued by a dashing and heroic parent.<br /><br /> This is no orphan Annie story, what makes this dear little girl and her friends stories, so thoroughly addictive to Children (and the odd Adult!) is the boundless energy and creativity of her imagination, the ultimate defensive tool of the hurt child.<br /><br /> The books are clever, sweet, mischevious and subtly moral.<br /><br /> The children clammer to resolve their pain and enjoy their lives and the staff try very hard to make the \\"dumping ground\\" a well run and loving home and family.<br /><br /> The books have a lot to say about caring, sharing and the importance of loving family (whatever form that might take) alongside not shying from the damage done to these children and their own capicity to overcome it. The books manage to mingle sentiment and morality into a non judgemental frame that doesn't induce immediate boredom and balking in Children.<br /><br /> We have only one problem now, being nagged to buy the accompanying TV series on DVD, Thank you awfully BBC!, having said that whenever I have taken a peak at the show it is terribly good!	2005-02-18

It's all must do's and must buys and must have's. Don't get me wrong, she is a cracking cook and I gaurantee that if you follow one of her recipes to the letter YOU WILL NOT GO WRONG. She just rather saps all the fun out of cooking. If you fancy cooking with  a feisty British woman who does not mind if you dip in a pinky and taste every now and then, then I suggest Nigella Lawson, it's like the difference between painting with Salvador Dali or doing a paint by numbers class; wickedly good fun!	2005-02-18

It captures an essential and sedate sense of Britishness long since lost and it is written with sad eye on the changes to come almost as if it anticipates them. This seems to be why the author takes such intense pleasure in the ordinary and brings such events to life, vividly, with huge empathy and comfort. There are elements of it's purpose and philosophy in the film version, but the film is much more dramatic and by and large bares no resemblence to the novel.<br /><br /> Being British, and having had family who survived the Blitz and the horrors of WW2, this book brought me to tears often for it must have captures the price paid for war, so eloquently.<br /><br /> The books emotive power lies in it's solid sense of it's time and in the sense of all that is to change. It's pleasent sense of ordinary, comfortable and uneventful plodding is strangely powerful.	2005-02-17

I revisted this book very recently, it chronicles the tale of a 20th century British Family trying to live live life as it was lived a the end of 19th century. A good proportion of Britains housing stock hails from the Victorian to pre WW2 periods, so it was not difficult to find a house suitable to be transported back in time. The family had a real struggle with all aspects of daily life, cooking, cleaning, entertainment, peronal hygiene and worst of all for the females, the clothes (moreover the loathed and dreaded corset!).  A marvellous historical resource for children, particularly if you can get hold of the TV documentry as well. It was originaly shown on Channel 4 in Britian to mark the the millenium. I am pretty sure Amazon uk has it on DVD, for the intersted.	2005-02-17

One of the may \\"relatives\\" of the original \\"Art Book\\", this is possibly the most accesible of the collection. The photographic image is after all, an art form we can all identify with and one which most of us regularly utilise and interact with.<br /><br /> The layout follows the same gentic coding as the previous books, which is a tried, tested and highly sensible a-z format, exploring a wide range of artistic schools as it wades through the alphbet.<br /><br /> The chosen works are stunning and like any good gallery plan, aims to stir a vast range of human emotion and experience.<br /><br /> My only problem with this book, and it is more a criticism of the genre really, is that page after page of same artisitic medium (however diverse the pictures may be) renders it a little lack lustre, but then however beautiful a picture may be one cannot escape the basic premise that the image is more about good fortune than good work;however skilled the cameraman/woman.<br /><br /> While I would undoubtedly recommend this book, it is the quieter child of the family and you won't want to visit it as often as it's more vibrant siblings.	2005-02-17

All this family of books do likewise but with this book it seems so much more important to get that structure absolutley right, and they have.<br /><br /> Like the other members of it's family it has an a-z approach and takes in a vast array of genres, suprising just how diverse 20th century art is. The only problem, as always, is that those on display have to be limited, so naturally some works and even some artists do not appear. I would not allow that to be off putting, this little family of books gets bigger by the year so I feel assurred that the unrepresented will not stay so for very long!	2005-02-17

There is even a handy glossary of terms so you can ponder the meaning of \\"expressionism\\" and \\"dada\\" to your hearts content.<br /><br /> This is a great work and to boot has achieved the nigh impossible. Inspite of it's reach and wide appeal the art world doesn't codemn it nor treat it with characteristic snobery! Indeed it seems to be widely accepted as a book which has demystified the art world and helped to take the barriers to it down, with considerable dignity.<br /><br /> It is a great book for students, creative professionals and the mini sized version is perfect for cultural high days and holidays! Mine has been to Tate Modern, London, The MOMA New York and The Louvre, Paris, without raising a single contempt filled eyebrow.	2005-02-16

A wonderful resource and superbly edited by Ms Drabble to not only meet the founding principles of this work (which first appeared in the 1930's) but also to consider the ever changing parimeters of what good and great literature is, a highly subjective notion at best.<br /><br /> The title almost does not do this work justice, it bestows it with a crusty old British acaedemic image. You almost imagine having to blow the dust off it before you can begin! But it is so much more rich and diverse than this and should not be avoided by those made nervous by it's title; it is not the untouchable work it sounds like it may be.<br /><br /> If literature is a love of yours, whether by author or genre, then you will find this brilliantly informative. Don't be put off by this being such an enormous book, it needs to be, it will become a dear and chubby friend in no time!	2005-02-16

I enjoyed this book immensley, it tells the story of a working class woman's life from Bristol, England; from her childhood to retirement and beyond. It is the author's own story and it is both richly illustrated and candid. Most striking is it's social representation of both working class British life, the role of Women and the huge changes they faced during the course of the 20th century.<br /><br />  Joyce, the main character, is spirited and unable to find her true purpose. Her life follows a standard expected pattern and she beautifully tells of the both the joys and agonies of her limited choices.<br /><br /> A spirited woman is centre stage throughout, having brushes with independence, politics, career development and the calling for which she had the greatest gift, writing.<br /><br /> Joyce Storey joined a writing group in her retirement and the novels (for this an amalgum of three books) came from her work in the group.<br /><br /> The Author is now deceased which for me adds poignancy and hope to the novel, while Joyce comes late to her calling; at least it comes!	2005-02-15

One cannot stress enough how important the work is, not only in terms of it's strong statement agaisnt racism and facism, but also in terms of it's fragile beauty.<br /><br /> The tragedy of the novel is in it's exposed privacy, the emerging spirit of a developing and intelligent young woman and the sense it gives us of a thousand similair stories never told and lost forever.	2005-02-15

She had either great artistic insight and intigrity or a bratish desire to boost of her wealth.<br /> I didn't reach a conclusion having read this book, but then maybe she was doing a bit of both and wanted to keep us guessing? I found the book enormously entertaining and informative if a little disrespectful of it's subject.<br /> One cannot help but to consider that this disrespect and the virtual anonymous space she occupies in history, might be very different had she been Peter and not Peggy.<br /> A great read for modern art lovers, a fairly good one for anyone else.<br /> Though it cannot be helped nor altered, it is a book very heavy on characters, plot, and at times, weighty information; which can be very offputting and confusing.	2005-02-15

But you would have to be a very ardent fan to stick with this book, it does not have the richness of language nor the skill of emotional story development to bring any of the material to life.<br /><br /> Mr Acorah is a very interesting man and doubtless a very nice man but he is not a writer, this in itself need not be a problem had the editorial and production team on this book done him justice. They simply don't and as such commit this book to a hard core fan purchases only. A shame really, it had all the potential of a bestseller for the RIGHT reasons.	2005-02-14

This a great tribute to perhaps the most influential design institute of the 20th Century.<br /><br /> The story of it's development, philosophy, success and untimely end is perfectly chronicled here.<br /><br /> The expert, novice and vaguely interested would find this book useful. It's a superb acaedemic source and an important catalogue. Bauhaus still influences design today and should also be regarded historicaly as yet another victim of the Nazi regime.	2005-02-13

This book is essentially an acaedemic text, but it is written with great knowledge, narrative and empathy for it's subject matter. So much so that it is not at all the chore that would usually be the remit of acaedemic works.<br /><br /> There is, as with all such texts, no need to read it cover to cover. But each chapter has narratives which is so engaging as to tell the facts, the emotions and the bare tragic bones of each story.<br /><br /> It is a brilliant historical catalogue of a much ignored and now largely forgotten people, of great use to students of all ages. Equally a very engaging social read.	2005-02-13

Most striking by far is the harshness of past societies in which the poor were virtually ground into the dirt and totally at mercy of commerce.  Yet still the love and joy of these kindly, caring and sweet natured people shines through, it took a great deal to make them lose all hope. One cannot help but to think that these poor and hardworking forbares made more than a little of the muscle in the British national psyche.<br /><br /> The Authors journey is one of love, loss and curiousity, his intelligence is meant for better things than the dust and grime of cotton mills but so hard worked are his people and he that this realisation is a long time coming.<br /><br /> Highlights characters are Grandma Bridget and the lovley Aunts he visits in Summer. Quite a journey and very much a joy to read.	2005-02-12

The first chapter of this book is by far the most difficult, the central character is cruelly duped, assaulted and murdered and she is just 14.<br /><br /> What follows is the journey of she and her family as their pain and anger begins to undo and disintergrate them and then slowly, inch by inch, bring them back to each other with power and integrity.<br /><br /> The journey is one of agony, dissapoitment, guilt and redemption as the central character strives to build her new world and free those she left from the pain of her loss.<br /><br /> After the agony of chapter one I thought I could not go on with this book but it is more than worth sticking with.<br /><br /> And surely this is the Authors intention, not, as he been suggested by many, to sensationalise child murder. But to profile and ease the journey. What better way for us to consider the horror of such an event than to placed in postion of emapathy. This book does just that superbly.	2005-02-12

Much has been said about his book, it's plot and premise.<br /><br />The thing most reviews seem to miss is how importnat this book is in demonstrating the emotional world of Aspergers Syndrome. Too often this condition, and I use that term for want of a better one, is dimissed as one in which the individual lacks normal emotional responses. I feel this work demonstrates the inaccuracy of that stance, Christopher, the central character does not lack emotion at all, moreover he expresses it differently. His responses to his sense of emotion are primal and honest. It does not seem that he is wrong so much as incapable of developing cynicism, \\"normalisation\\" and manipulation. He has honest, earlier sensibilities.<br /><br /> And all this coexists with a blindingly hot intellect.<br /><br />It seems almost to be a blissfull mode of being and the question is raised, if it is not the rest of us who so smugly assume we are developed correctly, who may have the \\"special needs\\". Christopher has much more a sense of honesty about his own internal world and his relationship with it afterall.<br /><br /> This is great book with simple and powerful insights, even if you know nothing of Aspergers, you will after this and you will probably wonder, as did I, what is so wrong with this anyway?<br /><br /> Christopher is an infuriating delight and hear lies the premise I believe the Author wants us to most explore, \\"is Christopher so different and if so why and if there are whys, are they wrong?\\".<br /><br /> I have a dear friend who wrote a book on this subject, in respect of her x-boyfriend; \\"Loving Mr Spock\\" by \\"Babara Jacobs\\" In her book she prefers to call people like Christopher, emotionally \\"different wired\\" and I really see that after reading this book. It is not a matter of a difference that needs correction so much as difference that needs socially assimilating and needs learning from.	2005-02-11

Worth a look nonetheless, for it is the genre of these books which is so amusing and intelligent. I get so tired of this notion that by acknowledging the purile, wicked and taboo we somehow become all of those things ourselves and worse still, evil. These books encourage us to see the natural and lighter side of wicked and intrusive humour. Far healthier to do so than claim not have such thought or feeling because it's inhuman, it is very much so human! What better way to develop greater understanding of your own mind than through humour?<br /><br /> Incidently, to any detractors of this theory, no actual little fluffy bunnies were hurt in the making of these books!	2005-02-11

Don't be to eager to dismiss this book as superficial, for females only or aimed at the fashion/ art set. It is a well researched and knowledge packed directory into the ploitics and social history of fashion and beauty, throughout the entire 20th century.<br /><br /> It would be of immense value to students of 20th century history, women's studies as well as an invaluable and pictorial journey for children exploring the recent past.<br /><br /> The layout is well structured and the photography, art and fashion plates are breath taking.<br /><br /> Even if just a coffee table book, it's far more engaging than the average trendy photo album.	2005-02-11

I read this book during a trip in the USA, not because I was missing England, heck no I was glad to be seeing the back of blighty for a while! I read it because I was intrigued by the amount of Americans I met on my trip who beautifully and politely, seemed to find ME endlessly interesting.<br /><br />I would not have gained such interest at home had I walked down Oxford Street stark naked!<br /><br /> Mr Bryson helped me to understand why the difference is so and why it is so captivating. He did this from both the perspective of being a fascinated and enthusiastic American and an eccentric and repressed Brit, for he truly is a blend of both. The fascination our two countries have for each other is based as much on our similarity as it is our differencs and yet the similarities and differences are always bedfellows.<br /><br /> A great example of this is the sheer volume of Americans prepared to identify themselves as \\"Anglophiles\\", I love the US with equal passion, as I know do most of my kinsmen, and yet I find that hard to say to other Brits; it just seems overly expressive and un-British somehow, and I know it would be recieved with embarressed indifference! Particularly if I dared to suggest I was an Americophile! Weirdly, again, this is as odd as it is completely understandable!<br /><br /> While in the states I noticed the cheeriness of your national psyche, the confidence, the interest in people, the strangeness of local customs and the comfort to be gained in enjoying the differences and becoming part of the \\"different\\"<br /><br />This was exactly Mr Bryson's experience in reverse in this book, it is an exquisitely funny, deliciously evocative and sentimental journey through my homeland and I have to say he, for me, captures the essence of Britian and Britishness perfectly. He made me howl at our insanity, cringe at our emotional indifference (bourn largely out of inbred embarressment) and swell with a tearful sense of pride that was overwhelming at times. It put my journey to the US and feelings for my home land, into crystal clear perspective.<br /><br /> He gives a wise and decisive voice to the odd and quirky specialness of our two nations relationship.<br /><br />This surely signifies the awesome power of Mr Bryson's pen.US and feelings for my home land, into crystal clear perspective. <br /> He gives a wise and decisive voice to the odd and quirky specialness of our two nations relationship. <br />This surely signifies the awesome power of Mr Bryson's pen.	2005-02-11

In Andy Riley we have a great homourist who preys on the human weakness of finding frivolity in the taboo, this book is is demonically funny.<br /><br /> It feels like a fun poking into realms we ought to not find fun, human nature makes such things irresistably amusing! think being angrily told to stop giggling by a red faced and enfuried, windbag of a teacher!<br /><br /> This is also a very clever book for if we do not address a taboo with humour then we do not address it period and thus increase it's hallowed, untouchable status.	2005-02-11

It is beautifully structured, expertly researched and the recipes are not only catatonia inducingly yummy but Nigella's dialogue about them is as sintilating and seductive as ever she is.<br /><br /> What I liked so much also was that she had tried to include a wide denomination of festivals and feasts. Not all are featured, obvoiusly, the book would take eons to produce otherwise. For my own part I was a little dissapointed that Diwali was overlooked (the Hindu festival of lights) largely becuase I live in a part of Britain which has a huge Diwali festival and I have always wanted to make some of those lovely savoury and sweet nibbles (I'll research what actress and cook Madhur Jaffrey has on this and report back!) Nonetheless I was enthralled with the reach of her knowledge and it was every bit as intriging to find out about feasts I have never been to as it was to salivate on food ideas. Even slime soup is georgous and Children will love the gorily named menu!<br /><br /> Feast is a great cook book and won't gather dust in your Kitchen. Nigella's food is always sumptious and utterly delicious, check out her ham cooked in Coca Cola - sublime!<br /><br /> Just for the record, to my American cousins who may not be able to figure the lumping together of Thanksgiving and Christmas, I suspect it is because the traditional British Christmas Lunch is incredibly similair to the US Thanksgiving Dinner. Another hit from Nigella and I don't think it will spend anytime in the shadow of her other works.	2005-02-07

Nigel Slater is a renowed TV and published Chef in my country.<br /><br /> His work is consumed with all the gusto of those who are considered his wise contemparies. If you are not familair with him he is every bit as inspiring and knowledgable as the wonderful Nigella Lawson, (How to be a Domestic Godess).<br /><br /> Here he tells us of his childhood in 1960's Birmingham (UK) and each stage of his development is either a delicious recipe or a daliance with some foul tasting horror. His delicious writing being every bit as adept at tale telling as it is at sorting a dinner party for 12.<br /><br /> The story is passionate and animated as the boy becomes the man, struggling to understand what life has dealt him and trying to express emotions through culinary creation.<br /><br /> This novel is an accurate, social historic depiction of England in the 1960's. A pre-diverse culture England which was still shaking off the last remains of Victorian values and which had yet to let Migrant cultures permeate.<br /><br /> Nigel stirred my emotions and memories often here, being a British child of the same decade, this is not to say you will not find enjoyment here if you don't identify with his world.<br /><br /> The themes are powerful and fairly universal, though the upbringing and world of such repressed emotion, cast iron secrets and children being seen but not heard is very British, the experience of loss, marginalisation, anger, grief, emerging sexuality, rebeliion and the wicked step parent are all here.<br /><br /> And always there is the food, each chapter begins with his  feelings for a foodstuff (the chapters are small and punchy and feel like a seductive and greedy secret, \\"I'll just have one more before I put it down!\\") and this is exquisitely played off against his feelings for a time, place or person.<br /><br /> This book is really worth a shot, it has done biography in a different and inspired way, it also feels and tastes, bittersweet; a comfort and sad lonely tale all at once.	2005-02-07
