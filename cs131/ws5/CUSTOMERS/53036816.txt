US	53036816	R2Y7A0H0Q10O7T	0399152938	648470787	Marker	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Terrific page turner	If you're a fan of medical mysteries, this is a must read. Robin Cook is on top of his game as he brings back the Pathology team of Jack Stapleton and Laurie Montgomery to solve the cases of mysterious deaths of apparently healthy patients (sound familiar, doesn't it). That's not to say Cook resurrects old material - sinister health insurance companies and medical procedures are a big part of this novel, but the author has the talent to breathe new life into old plot lines. The sub plots of Laurie's medical problems and the \\"bad guy\\" (one hell of a nasty nurse) are anything but distracting. Not wanting to spoil the ending for anyone, but chapter 24 has got to be one of the most exhilarating pages Cook has ever written.  Perfect summer time entertainment.	2005-06-10

It's been pretty predictable that neither Spencer or Hawk EVER lose a fist or gun fight. Until now. Never mind Hawk is shot in the back - as he so aptly puts it: \\"Not supposed to get shot\\". Mortality, and age, is rearing it's ugly head at the 2 superheroes, and Parker is honest enough to deal with it.	2005-04-24

That in itself is worth an extra star or two. My only \\"problem\\" with the book is at the end: I almost said out loud \\"That's it??\\" Not quite the ending I was expecting. Other than that, Trace is a fast paced, enjoyable read and it seems that Dr. Scarpetta is coming out of her funk. Maybe next book will focus on HER, rather than Lucy, Marino, or Benton - all minor characters.	2004-10-31

Mr. White \\"seems\\" to be a rather pitiful fellow, but all is not what it seems to be. In this novel, the good guys can turn out bad and vice versa. Told from each character's perspective, the story weaves not so much a mystery thriller, but rather an insight on personal pains, demons, and redemption.	2004-05-16

I liked the way each chapter is from one of the characters point of view - it gives the reader different perspectives of the same scene. Very, very fast read - a change from past Thomas Cook novels. Only minor problems are characters: one is WAY over-the-top (the bad guy), while another is under-developed (the heroine). Otherwise, a terrific book for a short weekend.	2004-05-02

The reader was impressed at the writing skill and depth of the writer - the book HAD to be read slowly to appreciate the nuances he brought to the story, however gruesome the topic. Now he goes and writes something completely out of style: a book that grabs you from the first chapter and doesn't let you go until the final page. Great writing, as usual, but much more fast-paced than in the past. Terrific book.	2004-05-01

US	53036816	R3KSP3ZVS3VC89	0399150897	362587713	Blow Fly	Books	4	0	2	N	N	Better than I expected	After reading the brutal reviews posted here, I expected much worse. What I like about this series is how the characters grow, both in age and emotion. Lucy started out as a computer geek little girl and now she's gone through the FBI, DEA, got promoted, got fired, and winds up the strongest characacter in this installment, teaming up with partner Rudy (interesting duo). Even Marino is on Lucy's payroll. This series so far, as in real life, has resulted in a weary and troubled Kay Scarpetta getting tossed out of Virginia and banashed to consulting work in Florida, Marino and Lucy sharing a deep, dark secret that can never be exposed to Kay, 'the wolfman' waiting to be executed on death row in Texas, and two seriously nasty serial killers. I won't give away any plot details - this is a very interesting read. If you've gotten this far in the series, this is just another good installment - the next one should shed light on the untied knots at the end.	2003-11-01

He somehow thinks the way to solve this problem is to grow phallic shaped mushrooms. In order to grow these mushrooms, one needs a supply of maggots. In case you have not guessed yet, maggots come from dead things. <br />This is the only book I have ever read that made me sick to my stomach. That alone deserves 5 stars, but it also is a very different and interesting read. Not for the faint of heart.	2003-10-05
US	53036816	ROGBI417OMZ9Q	0804108218	773952520	Chicago Loop	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Dark	Having read Chicago Loop a few years ago, I felt compelled to offer my 2 cents due to the overly negative reviews posted here. It is a very good book by a great author, dealing with sexual desires and thoughts that some might find disturbing. I get the idea that this is what the author intended, and the hellish ride through the main character's psyche as he descends into the depths of despair and depravity is a hell of a good read.   Having been written in 1990, it must have been shocking to some at the time - now it would be considered &#34;a bit&#34; twisted, but not overly so.  If you can get through Joyce Carol Oates &#34;Zombie&#34; and enjoy the read, this will be a cakewalk.	2003-10-05

My first choice was Angels and Demons and the similarities between both works are glaring, to put it mildly. Don't get me wrong, it's quite an enjoyable page turner (although at times I felt like throwing the book against the wall and screaming \\"ENOUGH!\\"), but the story stretches credibility to the breaking point. Like Da Vinci Code, Brown is very informative about Christianity and you do learn a great deal that you might not have known before - like the origins of that strange pyramid on the back of a dollar bill. Another plus is the very interesting plot twists at the end of the book that make reading it worthwhile.	2003-10-05

You already know what the story is about - the film should be interesting. My main problem is the believability of the killer and how things are TOO neatly tied up at the end. Aside from that very minor flaw, this is a must read for anyone interested in fine writing of any genre.	2003-09-20

He quit the Secret Service after killing his partner to save his own skin,  an act that causes Billy to lose all self esteem he previously had. He believes himself, perhaps rightly so, a coward, a loser, and a worthless piece of garbage. The reason he doesn't kill himself, i believe, is to rid himself of this burdon he decides is his 'raison d'etre'. <br />Doesn't sound like a pretty good cop (not really a cop, more of an unpaid 'advisor'). WRONG. He still posesses great investigating skills. You kind of like this character in spite of himself: his being funny at the wrong time, telling jokes to relieve pressure situations, talking in his Irish brogue for no apparent reason, speaking to people over their intellectual powers without insulting them. <br />This second book in the Billy Tree series involves the lynching of a black man some 50 years in the past and the repercussions today. Excellent writing - the kind you have to read a bit more slowly than normal to appreciate to gift that David Wiltse posseses.	2003-09-20

To play devil's advocate, it can also be perceived as a concocted Utopia, where everyone is delighted to be taken hostage by terrorists who, of course, are not what they seem to be. Not to go any further, Bel Canto is a very enjoyable read, exploring areas that were unknown to me, namely opera. The epilogue may have been the author's way to tie things up neatly, but it makes absolutely no sense in terms of the character development in the previous chapters. It detracts from the book rather than sums thing up.	2003-04-04

This is essential, because if you're trying to catch a mouse, you may have to lie in wait for long periods of time - or in the case of 'Pursuit', spend lots of time establishing you are someone you are not in order to catch your prey. This is typical Perry, paying attention to detailed real life situations of people who make livings either killing poeple of making them disappear. An excellent, if somewhat violent, read.	2002-01-27

It is highly entertaining, the characters are portrayed so well that you get to 'know' them after a while. The story itself is great: a small town in Maine that's going downhill fast; the hero runs the run-down local diner: a loser in most things material but a possible winner in the most important thing of all. I won't spoil it for those who have not read it by getting into plot details. My only minor complaint is that I kept on reading the dialogue as spoken words in a film. I suppose that's what you get for doing so well to familiarize the reader with the characters. It WOULD make an interesting film, with Kevin Costner as the forlorned hero, Wilford Brimly as his dad, etc, etc.  Very good read, I'll look for other Russo works at the local library.	2001-08-04

More to the point, 'A Painted House' is a nice little story that, if written by anyone  but John Grisham, would be just that: a nice little story. The problem with Grisham is that he must live up to his monumental reputation and give us a story with enough plot twists and turns to make you spend the night turning pages. Not this time.

It's been a very entertaining journey so far, and 'Death Benefits' does not disappoint. Perry's writing skills are still at the top of their form - Here's an example from early on in the story:<br />  Stillman sat down and squinted up at the waiter for a few seconds as though the two of them were at a poker game and the waiter had just raised. The waiter held a tiny pad in the palm of his hand with a pen poised over it. Stillman said,&quot;Can your bartender make a real mai tai?&quot;  <br /> &quot;Old-fashioned kind?&quot; asked the waiter, now assessing Stillman with veiled interest.  <br /> &quot;That's right,&quot; said Stillman. &quot;The old-fashioned kind.&quot;  <br /> &quot;Two mai tai old-fashioned kind,&quot; the waiter announced, and put a strike mark on his pad that could not have been a Chinese character, then spun on his heels and went off. It seemed to Walker that the pad must be for appraising the customers, and Stillman had scored high.<br />The characters are believable and, of course, as with every Perry novel, you learn something new in case you decide to embark on a life of crime. I knew the 'surprise' last quarter of the novel before the characters figured it out, but no big deal. It's a definite page turner. Read it!!	2001-02-11

Having read almost all in the Spenser series, this latest installment is,  of course, a must read. Very interesting plot that falls a little short due  to 1) Lack of Hawk, 2) No gourmet wizardry, 3) Too many references to  Coca-Cola, 4) Minimal fisticuffs. It also seemed to me that the  Susan/Spenser relationship was sweetened a bit much by the pair literally  crying over the phone about how much they missed one another (Spenser's  away on the case).

It always amazed me that a movie hasn't been made out out this great story line: Hit-man on the run, young female FBI agent and Mafia hit-men on his  trail. What fascinated me was the detailed picture that Perry paints on the  need of a person in a business such as the 'Butcher's Boy' to blend into  the background and, by all means, NOT get noticed: what clothing to wear, what food and drink to order at a restaurant, how and where to walk.

Michael Tolkin, who wrote the novel in which the movie, 'The Player', is based, does a masterful job of writing. This tragic-comedy takes place, for the most part, in the mind of the &quot;hero&quot; of the novel. His thoughts, doubts, worries, and questions (MANY questions) make this an fascinating insight into the mind of a very troubled man. The supporting cast include his former lover who wants nothing more to do with him; his caring brother, who is repeatedly referred to as &quot;Lowell, who is a homosexual&quot;; his pain-in-the-ass parents; and the attractive airline representitive hoping to dissuade a lawsuit.
