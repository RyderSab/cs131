It contains substantial poems by notables such as David Shapiro (\\"A Burning Interior\\") and Kenneth Irby.  It is weighted toward Language Poetry and New York School, and short of the mediocrities that normally populate this series.  If you believe that poetry should be intellectually and artistically challenging, not just inane anecdotes told in warmed-over, flat, clichd language, this is the book for you.  It might be the most avant-garde anthology marketed toward  an essentially middle-brow public.  I hope this time it makes the connection.	2004-08-29

This early Koch is particularly refreshing.  Koch died in July of 2002 and has published many volumes of poetry, and this work brings us back to his literary origins.	2002-11-25

A few are slightly longer essays on key figures like Williams and Spicer.  What is amazing is how often Sorrentino is right.  His style is vigorous, his judgments firm.

His task is to uncover the mystery of his parents disappearance years before in Shanghai.  There is an air of unreality from the very first page, stemming from the narrator's simultaneously self-aware and self-deluded consciousness.  We don't believe for a moment that he is a &quot;detective&quot;; that is, he models himself after a fictional detective and his way of being a detective seems entirely literary.  Ishiguro designs each sentence to reveal this paradox of the clueless detective, who never perceives himself the way everyone else sees him.  He is almost autistic in his social skills!  <br />The novel can be either tedious or spell-binding, depending on one's perspective.	2000-10-02

While Ashbery is a difficult poet, his prose is reader-friendly; this book, then, provides insight into Ashbery's own unique poetic sensibility, as well as into the poets and writers he has chosen.  <br />This book provokes thought about issues of literary value. Why does Ashbery find supposedly &quot;minor&quot; figures more inspiring of his own writing?  Are his arguments for the value of these figures ultimately convincing?  Do marginality and eccentricity have an intrinsic value for him?  Before reading this book I did know something about Laura Riding, Raymond Roussel, and John Clare; the other writers came as revelations to me.  I am not convinced that every figure treated is of equal interest, but I am fascinated by Ashbery's own responses to these practically unknown &quot;cult authors.&quot;	2000-10-02

I share his concern for the future of reading, but found this book rather heavy-handed and  platitudinous--though I wouldn't dismiss anyone who loved it either. The  problem for me is that Bloom never stops to develop his insights in a  useful way; the approach is scatter shot and the tone pretentious.
