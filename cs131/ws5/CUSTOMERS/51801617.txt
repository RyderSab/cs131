Janet Malcolm's \\"Reading Chekhov: A Critical Journey\\" (2001) - a brilliant little book undeservedly maligned by some reviewers - sent me straight back to the book store for a biography of Anton Chekhov. I can report from this trip that the largest bookstore in South East Asia does not carry one single biography of Chekhov!<br /><br />Instead, I found \\"Anton Chekhov: A Life in Letters\\" (2004). And I did not regret it one bit. The book is the fullest collection of Chekhov's letters in English translation to date and contains 370 selected letters reproduced in full. It comes with a chronology of Chekhov's life, a very readable, splendid short introduction, suggestions for further reading, a helpful list of correspondents and four very useful maps. An index at the end of the volume assists in, among other things, finding references to stories and plays in Chekhov's letters.<br /><br />According to the editors, this book is also the first uncensored edition of Chekhov's correspondence in any language. Chekhov, a physician by training, called the facts of life by their name and took life's mishaps with a sense of humor. Later editors, more prudish and therefore considerably more boring, simply cut out what they called \\"rude language.\\" Only after Glasnost, in the 1990s, the official portrait of Chekhov as a \\"decorous and refined gentleman with a stick, who never permitted himself to use racy language and who was rather pious and sickly, with little interest in women\\" (xv) was beginning to be revised.<br /><br />The editors point out that Chekhov \\"may have hidden himself in his literary works, leaving it up to his readers to puzzle out his point of view, and he may have had an aversion to talking about himself in public, but in his letters he could be surprisingly outspoken at times,\\" (xxxv) and so it happens that his correspondence reads almost like the autobiography he always declined to write.<br /><br />Chekhov's letters illustrate why he is perhaps Russia's best-loved writer: \\"The qualities which first endeared him to Russian readers back in the 1880s are the same ones which explain his appeal today. He wrote no vast novels in which he attempted to solve the problems of existence [that would be Dostoevsky] or fathom the forces of world history [Tolstoy in \\"War and Peace\\"]. He had no particular axe to grind about how people should live their lives, but, like the good doctor that he was, he had a superb ability to diagnose what it was that prevented people from finding happiness and fulfillment and a unique talent for pinpointing it in a clear-sighted way that was a the same time immensely gentle and compassionate. He also had an infectious sense of humour and an unerring sense of life's ironies, which prevented his writing from ever becoming too portentous or sentimental.\\" (xxxvii)<br /><br />The photo used for the cover shows a pensive Chekhov with a slightly mischievous smile playing around the corner of his mouth. Almost as if just then one of his famous quips had crossed his mind: \\"Medicine is my lawful wedded wife, and literature is my mistress. When I've had enough of the one, I can go and spend the night with the other.\\"st endeared him to Russian readers back in the 1880s are the same ones which explain his appeal today.

US	51801617	RQMJK00C69SR2	0918172020	302629952	In Praise of Shadows	Books	5	140	149	N	N	Wabi Sabi - not to be confused with "wasabi"	The Japanese have an aesthetic concept called \\"Wabi Sabi.\\" This term consists of two words. \\"Wabi\\" literally means \\"poverty,\\" but in the aesthetic context it stands for simplicity; \\"Sabi\\" is literally \\"solitude, loneliness,\\" and for aesthetic purposes it means something like natural impermanence. Wabi Sabi encourages, as one observer put it, a profound feeling of inner melancholy, and an appreciation of quietly clear and calm, well-seasoned and refined simplicity.<br /><br />Andrew Juniper's \\"Wabi Sabi: The Japanese Art of Impermanence\\" summarizes the concept by saying that \\"the term wabi-sabi suggests such qualities as impermanence, humility, asymmetry, and imperfection. These underlying principles are diametrically opposed to those of their Western counterparts, whose values are rooted in the Hellenic worldview that values permanence, grandeur, symmetry, and perfection. ... Wabi-sabi is an intuitive appreciation of a transient beauty in the physical world that reflects the irreversible flow of life in the spiritual world. It is an understated beauty that exists in the modest, rustic, imperfect, or even decayed, an aesthetic sensibility that finds a melancholic beauty in the impermanence of all things.\\" (pages 2 and 51)<br /><br />In order to appreciate Junichiro Tanizaki's 50-page pamphlet \\"In Praise of Shadows\\" it helps to keep the concept of Wabi Sabi in mind. While many people would object to Tanizaki's anti-modernist view of art (and call it \\"reactionary\\" or \\"nationalist\\"), it is in fact a contemporary take on an ancient aesthetic concept that favors obliqueness (shadows) over brightness, weathered naturalness over functional novelty, the crude over the polished, and - ultimately - irrationality over rationality.<br /><br />Tanizaki's essay contains good examples of Wabi Sabi, and a few peculiarly funny ones that reek of Zen humor: \\"one could with some justice claim that of all the elements of Japanese architecture, the toilet is the most aesthetic. Our forebears, making poetry of everything in their lives, transformed what by rights should be the most unsanitary room in the house into a place of unsurpassed elegance, replete with fond associations with the beauties of nature.\\" (page 4) To a Western reader this sounds like unmitigated satire. But it is not. Tanizaki is serious about this stuff.<br /><br />In sum, I find \\"In Praise of Shadows\\" a very entertaining illustration of an important Japanese aesthetic concept, written by one of the most important Japanese authors of the 20th century. I bought the Leete's Island Books edition of the text, which I review here. Later I found that exactly the same translation is contained in Phillip Lopate's collection \\"The Art of the Personal Essay.\\" It may be better value for money.<br /><br />Of course, aesthetics are always a matter of taste. Speaking of which, \\"wasabi\\" - if you recall the title of this review - is Japanese horseradish.forebears, making poetry of everything in their lives, transformed what by rights should be the most unsanitary room in the house into a place of unsurpassed elegance, replete with fond associations with the beauties of nature.\\" (page 4) To a Western reader this sounds like unmitigated satire.

Firstly, it dares to compare Simonides of Keos, a Greek poet of the 5th century BC, and Paul Celan, a 20th century poet who wrote in German. Secondly, it dares to apply economic ideas, in particular those of Karl Marx, to explain poetry.<br /><br />What connects Simonides and Celan? They share a sense of alienation and an acute awareness of the limits of what \\"is;\\" and they are both masters of composition and language. Anne Carson points out that she chose to look at two men at the same time because the attention devoted to one enhances the attention devoted to the other: \\"Sometimes you can see a celestial object better by looking at something else, with it, in the sky.\\" (viii)<br /><br />A particularly fascinating aspect of both poets' work is their preoccupation with nothingness and negation. \\"Negation links the mentalities of Simonides and Celan. Words for 'no,' 'not,' 'never,' 'nowhere,' 'nobody,' 'nothing,' dominate their poems and create bottomless places for reading.\\" (9) It is exactly these bottomless places in their poems, invisible to the cursory reader, that Anne Carson knows to locate.<br /><br />Anne Carson divides the book into four chapters. In the first chapter, \\"Alienation,\\" Carson uses analogies from the sphere of economics most extensively. She explains how the changing economic situation of poets in the fifth century BC accounts for the fact that Simonides was considered the stingiest person of his time (in addition to being one of the smartest). The \\"economy\\" in the title of the book refers to the actual life of the poet as a recipient of gifts and money, and to the act of composing poetry. The \\"unlost\\" in the title is a more complex idea and hints at the themes of negation and nothingness explored in the other three chapters.<br /><br />In chapter two, \\"Visibles Invisibles,\\" Carson discusses Simonides' philosophy of art (\\"the word is a picture of things\\") and how painting a picture relates to \\"painting\\" a poem. \\"Simonides is Western culture's original literary critic, for he is the first person in our extant tradition to theorize about the nature and function of poetry.\\" (46) Carson goes on to show how Simonides and Celan use grammar to \\"render a relationship that is ... deeper than the visible surface of the language,\\" (52) and how both poets' \\"language has the capacity to uncover a world of metaphor that lies inside all our ordinary speech like a mind asleep.\\" (58) She points to the exact locations in the poems where poetic language indicates an invisible \\"reality\\" beyond the reality of ordinary speech, where poetry arises from words and the (visible) surface of language reflects a deeper (invisible) truth.<br /><br />Chapter three studies Simonides' epitaphs. \\"No genre of verse is more profoundly concerned with seeing what is not there, and not seeing what is, than that of the epitaph.\\" (73) Epitaphs are inscriptions on graves. Simonides was the most prolific composer of epitaphs in the ancient world, Carson tells us, and set the conventions of the genre. \\"Tears of Simonides\\" were the byword for poetry of lament used by Catullus. Epitaphs have two economic aspects: the economics of remuneration and the economics of composition, as the poet has to use his words economically to fit them on the grave-stone. Epitaphs are also related to the visible and the invisible because they connect the living with the dead: \\"The responsibility of the living to the dead is not simple. It is we who let them go, for we do not accompany them. It is we who hold them here - deny them their nothingness - by naming their names. Out of these two wrongs comes the writing of epitaphs.\\" (85)<br /><br />Chapter four, \\"Negation,\\" focuses our attention on the fact that \\"nothing\\" needs close thought. \\"The word lends itself to scary word play, to unanswerable puns, to the sort of reasoning that turns inside out when you stare at it. Simonides and Celan are both poets who enjoy this sort of reasoningand who orient themselves toward reality, more often than not, negatively.\\" (100) Negation is a very powerful tool, and Carson wants our attention for the difference in implied meaning between, say, \\"Life is suffering\\" and \\"Nothing is not painful among men,\\" as Simonides phrased it. Negation is also something uniquely human because a negative is a verbal event, \\"a peculiarly linguistic resource whose power resides with the user of words.\\"(102) When you say \\"this is not that\\" you need to put something present (\\"this\\") and something absent (\\"that\\") on the screen of your imagination. \\"The interesting thing about a negative, then, is that it posits a fuller picture of reality than does a positive statement.\\" (102) Carson then shows with examples from Simonides' and Celan's poetry how much beyond the factual these poets can express by not saying \\"something\\" but \\"not nothing.\\"<br /><br />\\"Economy of the Unlost\\" is truly brilliant whenever Anne Carson dissects a poem because she brings to the task both her qualities as scholar of classical Greece and modern poet. I do not always agree with the way she employs metaphors from economics, but I take it that she uses the terms introduced by Karl Marx to point my attention to noteworthy aspects of the poetry even if by today's standards these terms have turned out to be incorrect. When Carson claims, \\"what is striking in Marx's analysis of the issue is this insight: that to value a piece of work is to price the mortal span,\\" (107) then she and Karl are obviously mistaken. A doodle produced by Bill Gates during a meeting would definitely fetch a higher price than a doodle by yours truly done in the same mortal span of time. But these are quibbles of an economist; they should not detract from my praise of Carson's work.<br /><br />The bottom line is: this is an outstanding work that brings the best of academic scholarship to the interpretation of poetry. It deserves every of its five stars.t of reasoning and who orient themselves toward reality, more often than not, negatively.\\" (100) Negation is a very powerful tool, and Carson wants our attention for the difference in implied meaning between, say, \\"Life is suffering\\" and \\"Nothing is not painful among men,\\" as Simonides phrased it.

You may soak in the tub while skimming through this slim volume. There's no pretense at scholarship, no bibliography, no footnotes.<br /><br />The selection of philosophers for this volume reflects the \\"Western canon.\\" Conspicuous by their absence are Confucius, Buddha, Lao-tse and - if I may dare categorize them as philosophers - Mohammed and Jesus. Being an American author, Bergman included his compatriots John Dewey, Ayn Rand and W.V.O. Quine. Ayn Rand in particular is a uniquely American phenomenon. I have never come across her name in any European anthology of philosophy. Had Bergman been a European, he would have probably replaced the three American philosophers by Karl Popper, Martin Heidegger and - I am pushing the limit of the definition for \\"philosopher\\" again - Sigmund Freud.<br /><br />But never mind, for a quick refresher in Philosophy 101, this is a quite pleasant read. When painted in such broad strokes as here, it is really striking how little interest Anglo-Saxon philosophers had in metaphysical and religious questions when compared to their continental European counterparts.<br /><br />Bergman presents his philosophers in chronological sequence from Thales and the pre-Socratics to Quine. The only hiccup occurs when he places the 18th century philosopher Rousseau not after his contemporaries Hume and Kant, but after Hegel and Marx who lived in the 19th century.<br /><br />Each of the philosophers has his own chapter with a short summary of his life, an introduction to a few basic ideas and a number of quotes from the philosopher's works. All of this is very basic, but you would not expect much more from a book you are invited to read in the bathroom.	2005-02-05

It is also the story of how self-interest, not surprisingly, overrides the general interest; how the United States, home to some of the largest oil and gas multinationals and the world's premier carbon dioxide emitting nation, sided with the Carbon Club; how Australia, the world's largest coal exporter, joined forces with the United States.<br /><br />The Kyoto Protocol will come into force on 16 February 2005. It has been ratified by more than 55 of its signatory countries. The United States, led by George W. Bush, however, walked out on the agreement in March 2001.<br /><br />The fact of global warming is hardly disputable. The five hottest years recorded since 1880 were 1998, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2001, with 1998 having been the hottest. Whether the warming effect is man-made is still subject to discussion. But a full three quarters of scientists working in the field of climate change make the burning of fossil fuels responsible for the recorded increase in temperature.<br /><br />The emission of carbon dioxide could be easily reduced if power could be economically generated by photovoltaic solar energy (PV). However, Adam Smith's invisible hand won't do the job in this particular case. It is a Catch-22 situation because PV will only be economically viable if the PV cells are mass-produced, but they are not mass-produced because people can't afford today's expensive PV products. This is a situation where government would have a proper role to fulfill - to jump-start a process that would help the common good where the mechanics of the market do not work. But unfortunately most governments do not care to do that.<br /><br />Already in 1997, Leggett notes, \\"every country had its companies lost in skepticism about climate change. But in the USA the scale of the collective denial was unique.\\" (264) Eight years later it is not much different. This denial comes at a cost, though. Not only the cost of becoming more and more isolated from global trends and losing the moral authority the USA enjoyed after Roosevelt and Truman established the country as a world power, but also an economic cost. State of the art ecological cars that really sell are not made by GM or Ford these days, but by Japan's Toyota. World-class oil companies with a comprehensive environmental policy are not ExxonMobil and ChevronTexaco of the US, but BP and Shell of Europe.<br /><br />Jeremy Leggett, by the way, founded his own company to promote and sell PV technology after he realized, with a certain bitterness, that his lobbying efforts to get emission limits agreed were not getting anywhere.ntry had its companies lost in skepticism about climate change.

US	51801617	RFLGRDTNLOIPJ	0142437654	719680984	Fragments (Penguin Classics) (English and Greek Edition)	Books	5	22	34	N	N	A new look at The Obscure	What we know of the work of the pre-socratic Greek philosopher Heraclitus are a few fragments, which are collected here in a new, free verse translation by the poet Brooks Haxton. Nothing is known about Heraclitus, the man. Many things are elusive and ambiguous in the surviving fragments of his work. His moniker is \\"The Obscure\\".<br /><br />Where obscurity asks for interpretation, intuition is a good guide. Where language creates obscurity, poets are supremely gifted guides. Poets have a unique talent to explore the many facets of language, to scan the many meanings and references of a word, to add and enlighten where scholars - almost always better versed in history, philosophy and grammar - tend to move cautiously on a well-trodden, narrow path.<br /><br />Good examples for this would be Anne Carson's translation of the fragments of Sappho, titled \\"If not, Winter\\", Stephen Mitchell's translation of the Book of Job, and Bill Porter's (he writes under the name of \\"Red Pine\\") translation of Lao-Tzu's Taoteching (Dao De Ching). Brooks Haxton's translation of the fragments of Heraclitus ranks in the same league.<br /><br />Brooks Haxton's translation is clear and uncluttered. It highlights the uncompromising thrust of Heraclitus' thought. Heraclitus, it appears, had a very toughminded logic peppered with quirky humor: \\"If everything were turned to smoke, the nose would be the seat of judgment.\\" (Fragment 37). He respected knowledge of the knowable, but made fun of people who claimed to know the unknowable: \\"Pythagoras may well have been / the deepest in his learning of all men. / And still he claimed to recollect / details of former lives, / being in one a cucumber / and one time a sardine.\\" (Fragment 17).<br /><br />An example of the qualities of the translation: Brooks Haxton translates Fragment 122 as \\"After death comes / nothing hoped for / nor imagined.\\" Charles H. Kahn, a scholar of Greek philosophy, translates this as \\"What awaits men at death they do not expect or even imagine.\\" These two translations are different in where they lead our thought. Haxton's \\"after death\\" makes us think \\"so what about BEFORE death?\\" Kahn's \\"what awaits\\" leads us to think \\"so WHAT does await us at death?\\" The difference in emphasis is important. Haxton's Heraclitus points us to our lives NOW, whereas Kahn's Heraclitus points us to the metaphysical nature of death. Heraclitus is neither a metaphysical philosopher nor a mystic. \\"The eye, the ear, / the mind in action, / these I value\\" says Fragment 13. Therefore, Haxton's translation is an improvement over the older, already very good and formally correct translation. Haxton \\"adds value,\\" as my banker colleagues like to say.<br /><br />James Hillman wrote an interesting introduction to \\"Fragments.\\" He explores what he calls his notion of \\"Heraclitus the psychologist.\\" That may not go down well with traditional scholars of Greek philosophy, but it is an intriguing aspect worthy of exploration nonetheless.<br /><br />One reviewer complained that a psychologist wrote an introduction to this edition. While I do agree that psychologists may not be the best people to comment on the details of Greek philosophy, they are -like it or not - among the foremost interpreters of \\"reality\\" in our modern world. In that respect, Hillman adds another - very contemporary - dimension to the interpretation of Heraclitus, and I welcome that. After all, Hillman is not a New Age fuzzy pop-psychologist. Nor does he interpret Heraclitus as a predecessor to New Age thinking. On the contrary, he comments that in Heraclitus there is \\"no sloppy emotionalism either. Heraclitus would hardly be found among enthusiastic revivalists or holistic healers of the New Age. 'Dry, the soul grows wise and good' ([Fragment] 74). 'Moisture makes the soul succumb...' ([Fragment] 72), which I have understood to be a warning against drowning in easiness. Comfortable, complacent, content - these soporifics extinguish the fire of the soul.\\" (Foreword, xv).<br /><br />To sum it up: In this Penguin paperback we have the most easily accessible modern translation of the fragments of Heraclitus on the market, and I recommend this book of less than 100 pages to anyone interested in philosophy and the history of human thought. Heraclitus influenced Plato, Aristotle, Marcus Aurelius, Montaigne, Nietzsche, Heidegger and Jung. His ideas also bear some striking resemblance to early Chinese Taoism. Coincidentally, Lao Tzu - the earliest philosopher of this school - lived in the same 6th century BC as Heraclitus.oreword, xv).<br /><br />To sum it up: In this Penguin paperback we have the most easily accessible modern translation of the fragments of Heraclitus on the market, and I recommend this book of less than 100 pages to anyone interested in philosophy and the history of human thought.

US	51801617	R3ONSJPYB7WQ04	0156005743	369043297	A Book of Luminous Things: An International Anthology of Poetry	Books	5	88	91	N	N	An anthology of epiphanies	To call this excellent collection of poems an \\"international\\" anthology is a bit presumptuous. The bulk of the poems were written by poets whose native language is American (88), Chinese (53), Polish (35) or French (16). The selection, however, aptly reflects the geographical stations in the life of the Nobel Prize winner of 1980, Czeslaw Milosz. Born in 1911, he lived in Poland until 1951 when he emigrated to France. In 1960, invited by the University of California, he moved to Berkeley where he lived and worked until his death in August 2004. During the Second World War he lived in Warsaw, writing for the underground presses - which probably explains why only one German poem (by Rilke) appears in this book. To put this in perspective: poetry in German ranks on the same level as Inuit poetry here, one poem each.<br /><br />But never mind. After swallowing my national cultural pride, I admit that \\"A Book of Luminous Things\\" is my favorite anthology of poetry. By a wide margin. Milosz did not simply compile a \\"best of\\" collection; he created a very personal, intimate book. The poems collected in this anthology are as much about the joy of living as they are about the awareness that old age may bring. What they teach are attention to the particular and appreciation of the transitory. Milosz's proposition for the collection was to present poems, \\"whether contemporary or a thousand years old, that are, with few exceptions, short, clear, readable and, to use a compromised term, realist, that is, loyal toward reality and attempting to describe it as concisely as possible. Thus they undermine the widely held opinion that poetry is a misty domain eluding understanding.\\"<br /><br />Milosz titled the last chapter of his anthology \\"History.\\" At first, I found it a strange choice to conclude such a personal book with a chapter of poems that for the most part deal with the inhuman crimes perpetrated in the 20th century. A strange choice in particular because the preceding chapter titled \\"Non-attachment\\" would have given the book a final note of calm and serenity. Eventually, however, I considered the last chapter quite appropriate for a poet like Milosz who was committed to realism and political activism. As much as Milosz may have admired the attitude of non-attachment - illustrated with ultimate skill by the Chinese poets in this anthology - the formative experience of his life were the unspeakable deeds of cruelty committed by Germans in his home country.<br /><br />A Book of Luminous Things begins with a very short chapter titled \\"Epiphany.\\" Epiphany, Milosz explains, is an unveiling of reality. What in Greek was called 'epiphaneia' meant the appearance, the arrival, of a divinity among mortals or its recognition under a familiar shape of man or woman. Epiphany thus interrupts the everyday flow of time and enters as one privileged moment when we intuitively grasp a deeper, more essential reality hidden in things or persons. This definition of epiphany informs Milosz's understanding of realism. It is in fact an understanding that goes back to Heraclitus in European intellectual history and to Chuang Tzu in Chinese intellectual history - although admittedly the poems in this anthology are more easily accessible than most of the fragments of Heraclitus and Chuang Tzu.<br /><br />It is difficult to praise this book highly enough. Indirectly, surreptitiously it is a wonderful portrait of the old Czeslaw Milosz who was in his mid-eighties when he compiled it. It is also an intimate guided tour through poetry, with introductions to every chapter and short, illuminating comments on almost every poem. It is full of unexpected discoveries, especially when it comes to some contemporary female poets like Wislawa Szymborska (1923- ; Nobel Prize for Literature 1996), Denise Levertov (1923-1997), and Anna Swir (1909-1984). And finally, A Book of Luminous Things is one of the most impressive and inspiring documents of the plentiful harvest that can come with experience and age:<br /><br />THE GREATEST LOVE (by Anna Swir)<br /><br />She is sixty. She lives<br /><br />the greatest love of her life.<br /><br />She walks arm-in-arm with her dear one,<br /><br />her hair streams in the wind.<br /><br />Her dear one says:<br /><br />\\"You have hair like pearls.\\"<br /><br />Her children say:<br /><br />\\"Old fool.\\"at can come with experience and age: <br /> <br />THE GREATEST LOVE (by Anna Swir) <br /> <br />She is sixty.

Sarah, his owner, keeps him in the house to protect him from the neighbors' dogs. She is worried what they would do to Vincent who is so different. But Vincent is sad because he wants to play in the park, chase cats, and do what dogs do.<br /><br />So one day, after Sarah went to school, he sneaks out of the house and strolls down the road. Soon, he is surrounded by dogs who stare at him. \\"Uh, oh!\\" he thinks, \\"now I have a problem\\". But no. The dogs actually admire him, and they want to have a colorful fur, too. So Vincent opens a shop where he paints the other dogs blue, red, yellow, striped, or chequered.<br /><br />Meanwhile Sarah keeps looking for him. She sees all kinds of strangely colored dogs in the streets and decides to follow them. Then she finds Vincent and they are reunited.<br /><br />Charmingly illustrated, this story book by the young Frenchman Pascal Biet can be read as a very gentle satire on the fashion industry. But mostly, it is about a little dog with whom kids can identify. He is a sweet-tempered creature, a bit insecure about whether he will be accepted by the \\"normal\\" dogs, but eventually gutsy enough to give it a try.	2004-09-21

A short poem is shorter than a sonnet. It has less than 14 lines.<br />Armitage selected almost exclusively English and American authors' poems for his anthology, and most of them wrote in the 20th century. He begins with the short poems of thirteen lines, like Emily Dickinson's &quot;After great pain, a formal feeling comes&quot;; and he ends the book with Don Paterson's &quot;On Going to Meet a Zen Master in the Kyushu Mountains and Not Finding Him (for A.G.)&quot;. The latter consists of nothing but its elaborate title (plus the dedication, of course). Which is not only apt, but also funny.<br />My personal favorites in this anthology are: &quot;The Winter Palace&quot;, Philip Larkin's gruff ode to ageing; Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska's hilarious &quot;Bodybuilders' Contest&quot;; William Carlos Williams' literally sweet and delicious &quot;This is Just to Say&quot;; Mexican poet Octavio Paz's exemplary and witty &quot;Example&quot;; Robert Frost's &quot;Fire and Ice&quot;; and Carol Ann Duffy's &quot;Mrs Darwin.&quot;<br />Some short but sweet quotes from my favorites:<br />From scalp to sole, all muscles in slow motion.<br />The ocean of his torso drips with lotion.<br />The king of all is he who preens and wrestles<br />with sinews twisted into monstrous pretzels.<br />(from: Bodybuilders' Contest)<br />7 April 1852.<br />Went to the Zoo.<br />I said to him -<br />Something about that chimpanzee over there<br />  reminds me of you.<br />(Mrs Darwin)<br />The shorter the poems get, the wittier they tend to be:<br />Siesta of a Hungarian Snake (by Edwin Morgan)<br />s sz sz SZ sz SZ sz ZS zs ZS zs zs z<br />To a Friend is Search of Rural Seclusion (by Christopher Logue)<br />When all else fails,<br />  Try Wales.<br />As all anthologies, this one, too, is an invitation to read more by the poets that surprised or touched me, or that simply made me chuckle or guffaw. My only complaint in this respect is that Simon Armitage provided only the most basic of information: the year of birth and - should the case be - death of the poets. I found that an anthology gains tremendously from an editor's comments on the poems or the poets. In particular if the editor is an experienced poet himself.laint in this respect is that Simon Armitage provided only the most basic of information: the year of birth and - should the case be - death of the poets.

Great poets have their weak moments, but they tend to produce only the occasional bad line - say, for example, when William Wordsworth, one of England's greatest poets, wrote the unintentionally bawdy &quot;Give me your tool, to him I said.&quot;<br />Very bad poets, however, &quot;are perpetrators of a unique and fascinating kind of writing. Unlike the plainly bad or the merely mediocre, very bad poetry is powerful stuff. Like great literature, it moves us emotionally, but, of course, it often does so in ways the writer never intended: usually we laugh.&quot;<br />This book is dedicated to those writers, mostly from the 19th century, who excelled at very bad poetry with astonishing consistency. Those who were blessed, if that is the word, for their entire career with &quot;a wooden ear for words, a penchant for sinking into a mire of sentimentality, a bullheaded inclination to stuff too many syllables or words into a line or a phrase, and an enviable confidence&quot; that allowed them to write despite absolute appalling incompetence.<br />Here we find the awful metaphor (&quot;the dew on my heart is undried and unshaken&quot;) and the tortured rhyme (&quot;Gooing babies, helpless pygmies,/ Who shall solve your Fate's enigmas?&quot;) next to one of the most unappetizing titles for a love poem ever (&quot;I Saw Her in Cabbage Time&quot;).<br />Some of the most hilarious effects are created by the attempt to dramatize the pedestrian, as in the &quot;Ode on the Mammoth Cheese&quot;, aptly subtitled &quot;Weighing over 7,000 pounds&quot;:<br />We have seen thee, queen of cheese,<br />Lying quietly at your ease,<br />Gently fanned by evening breeze,<br />Thy fair form no flies dare seize. (there are five more delicious stanzas)<br />Not quite as riotously funny, but interesting as a phenomenon of the 19th century, is the preoccupation of very bad poets with death. It produced tasteless marvels of what the editors labeled &quot;tabloid verse&quot; like:<br />Oh, Heaven! It was a frightful and pitiful sight to see<br />Seven bodies charred of the Jarvis family;<br />And Mrs. Jarvis was found with her child, and both carbonized,<br />And as the searchers gazed thereon they were surprised.<br />Another favorite of very bad poets is the use of bizarre words in blissful ignorance of their meaning or the common readers' associations. One of the most talented in this respect was one Amanda McKittrick Ros, &quot;a writer with a gift for (as she puts it) 'disturbing the bowels.'&quot; To her we owe the following lines written on the occasion of her visit of Westminster Abbey:<br />Holy Moses! Have a look!<br />Flesh decayed in every nook!<br />Some rare bits of brain lie here<br />Mortal loads of beef and beer<br />Some of whom are turned to dust, [only some?]<br />Every one bids lost to lust.<br />The editors' favorite worst poem ever written in the English language bears the title &quot;A Tragedy&quot; - which, indeed, it is. But I don't want to spoil the fun by quoting it here. My own favorite is an excerpt from &quot;A Pindaresque on the Grunting of a Hog.&quot; Nothing describes the voice of a very bad poet better than the sounds this animal makes:<br />Harmonious Hog draw near!<br />No bloody Butchers here,<br />Thou need'st not fear.<br />Harmonious Hog draw near, and from thy beauteous Snowt,<br />Whilst we attend with Ear<br />Like thine prik't up devout,<br />To taste thy sugry Voice, which hear, and there,<br />With wanton Curls, Vibrates around the Circling Air,<br />Harmonious Hog! Warble some Anthem out!<br />Pindar, by the way, was the most famous lyric poet of ancient Greece. He lived in the 5th century BC and saw himself as a poet dedicated to preserving and interpreting great deeds and their divine values.<br />Another famous ancient Greek author (&quot;Sing, o muse, the wrath of Achilles ...&quot;) inspired a very bad poet to what is perhaps the worst line of poetry ever written without satiric intent: &quot;Now, Muse, let's sing of rats.&quot; In fact, the poet changed the last word from the original &quot;mice&quot; to &quot;rats&quot; because he found &quot;rats&quot; more dignified.poet changed the last word from the original &quot;mice&quot; to &quot;rats&quot; because he found &quot;rats&quot; more dignified.	2004-05-06

Barbara Tuchman is a captivating storyteller, and it speaks for the quality of her narrative history of France in the 14th century that the book remains in print after 25 years.<br />The red thread that runs through her book is the folly, pride and irrationality of behavior that she sees as characteristically human: \\"For mankind is ever the same and nothing is lost out of nature, though everything is altered,\\" as the quote from John Dryden says on one of the first pages of the book. The title itself reflects this philosophical position: the 14th century as a distant mirror for the 20th century. To be honest, I found this a bit far-fetched. The two centuries do not share that many similarities. Of course, human nature as such has not changed in the course of six centuries, and the madness of the two world wars is comparable to that of the Hundred Years' War (1337-1453). But the 20th century, for example, saw no epidemic like the plague that killed off more than one third of the population; on the contrary, the discovery of penicillin in 1928 and its application as an injectable drug in 1941 improved the chances of surviving a serious illness dramatically. More importantly, the 20th century did not see the first signs of disintegration of an established political order that would later give rise to a new one (the replacement of feudalism by the nation state); on the contrary, democratic states successfully withstood the challenge from totalitarian systems.<br />Where the book really shines, is the narrative. Barbara Tuchman gives a vivid and detailed picture of life in the 14th century, in particular the life of the nobility. She does not leave out the scandals or the slaughter of battles, the machinations of nobles greedy for power and the suffering of the peasants. Her style is descriptive and detailed. She does not simply tell that, say, realism was the desired effect of miracle plays and mysteries staged for the populace in the 14th century, she shows it in unforgettable detail: \\"When John the Baptist was decapitated, the actor was whisked away so cunningly in exchange for a fake corpse and fake head spilling ox blood that the audience shrieked in excitement.\\"(311/312) Her style is also not without the occasional wink at the reader. A fine example for her subtle sense of humor is the list of possessions of the Duc de Berry (famous for the illustrated book \\"Les Tres Riches Heures\\" he commissioned): \\"He owned one of Charlemagne's teeth, a piece of Elijah's mantle, Christ's cup from the Last Supper, drops of the Virgin's milk, enough of her hairs and teeth to distribute as gifts, soil from various Biblical sites, a narwhal's teeth, [and some more unique curiosities]\\"(427).<br />While I found the story telling absolutely captivating, there are two things about \\"A Distant Mirror\\" that made me choose four rather than five stars. One is the lack of analysis, the other Ms. Tuchman's occasional lapses into pop psychology.<br />The peripheral role of analysis in the book is perhaps a consequence of her narrative style. While Ms. Tuchman feasts on descriptions and details, she does not really want to dwell on the technicalities of changes in technology (other than those in the art of battle), medicine and economics, or on theories that try to put these developments in a broader perspective. At its worst, the reluctance to use analytical tools produces a kind of historical mysticism: \\"Times were to grow worse over the next fifty-odd years [after 1400] until at some imperceptible moment, by some mysterious chemistry, energies were refreshed, ideas broke out of the mold of the Middle Ages into new realms, and humanity found itself redirected.\\"(581)<br />The lapses into pop psychology happen when Ms. Tuchman generalizes; for example, when she concludes, \\"Human beings of any age need to approve of themselves, the bad times in history come when they cannot.\\"(451) Or when\\"pride and folly\\" become driving forces of history, because \\"Vainglory, however, no matter how much medieval Christianity insisted it was a sin, is a motor of mankind, no more eradicable than sex.\\"(577)<br />On the whole, though, \\"A Distant Mirror\\" is a pleasure to read, and I am sure the book will continue to find readers who enjoy the colorful and vivid stories Ms. Tuchman unfolds about the \\"calamitous\\" 14th century.n \\"pride and folly\\" become driving forces of history, because \\"Vainglory, however, no matter how much medieval Christianity insisted it was a sin, is a motor of mankind, no more eradicable than sex.\\"(577)<br />On the whole, though, \\"A Distant Mirror\\" is a pleasure to read, and I am sure the book will continue to find readers who enjoy the colorful and vivid stories Ms. Tuchman unfolds about the \\"calamitous\\" 14th century.	2004-04-26
US	51801617	RJEN9DDLNOJKE	0451528573	435162028	The Song of Roland (Signet Classics)	Books	5	88	89	N	N	The slaughter and glory of battle	The Song of Roland is the most famous of the &quot;chansons de geste&quot; (songs of deeds) of the Middle Ages. It provides a fascinating view into the spirit of warriors of that time and their motivation. The Song of Roland gives an idealized picture, of course, and if we can believe the historians, the medieval knights never lived up to their chivalric ideal.<br />The Song of Roland is not commonly included in the canon of must-read classics. Except in France, maybe. I assume the reason is that people in our time do not trace back their roots to the feudalism of the Middle Ages, and that they consider the chapter of chivalry closed after Cervantes's satirical portrait of knighthood in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. In one respect, however, this gory tale of slaughter, martyrdom and revenge is very contemporary. It illustrates the mindset of crusaders who see the world in terms of Good and Evil, and the language they use to incite contempt of the other party.<br />Apart from its historical value, the Song of Roland is also worth reading as literature - as an outstanding example for the heroic epic and as a piece of art whose &quot;simple yet elevated style and tone of high moral purpose&quot; (R. Harrison) is reminiscent of the Old Testament.<br />The three most easily available translations of the Song of Roland in the market are:<br />W.S. Merwin's 1963 prose translation with introduction, re-published in paperback by Random House's &quot;Modern Library&quot; in 2001 (ISBN 0375757112). His nine-page introduction is a succinct but sufficient overview of the historical events of AD 778 that became the basis of the Song of Roland. The translation stands out for its readability, and Merwin's choice of modern English makes the descriptions of violence even more direct and graphic: &quot;And Oliver rides through the battle, with his spear shattered to a stump, charges against Malun, a pagan, breaks his gilded shield with the flowers painted on it, knocks the eyes out of his head and brings his brains tumbling down to his feet.&quot; (page 43).<br />Robert Harrison's 1970 translation for Penguin Book's budget line &quot;Mentor Books&quot; (ISBN 0451528573) captures the throbbing, urgent rhythm of the verse form best: &quot;Olivier now gallops through the fray - / his lance has snapped, he only has a stump - / and goes to strike a pagan, Malsaron. / He breaks his gilt, fleuron-emblazoned shield, / bursting both his eyeball from his head - / his brain comes tumbling downward to his feet - &quot; (page 93). &quot;Fleuron-emblazoned&quot; is quite enigmatic compared to Merwin's clear &quot;with the flowers painted on it&quot;, but Harrison redeems himself by choosing &quot;bursting&quot; to emphasize the violence of the attack. The big plus of Harrison's book is his 42-page introduction. He explains the logic of medieval chivalry, why cruelty coexisted with sensitivity, and butchery with prayer. One interesting concept is the medieval &quot;ethos of success,&quot; or in other words the idea that the outcome justifies the means: When a knight killed another knight it was the will of God that this had happened, no matter by what means. Make the opponent trip and chop off his head - see, God is on your side. Harrison goes to quite some length to introduce the instruments of war, the armor and weapons, which is very helpful since the main body of the Song of Roland is about the glory and slaughter of battle.<br />Glyn Burgess's 1990 translation for Penguin Classics (ISBN 0140445323) is the most recent translation of the three. He stays closest to the form of the original, which gives his translation a certain wooden inflexibility but also a not entirely unbecoming pathos. His translation of Olivier's attack on Malun is quite telling: &quot;Oliver rides through the thick of the fray; / His lance shaft is broken, only a stump remains. / He goes to strike a pagan, Malun; / He breaks his shield, wrought with gold and flowers, / and smites both hiseyes out of his head. / His brains come spilling out over his feet;&quot; (page 72) While the use of &quot;wrought&quot; and &quot;smite&quot; sounds a bit old-fashioned, &quot;spilling&quot; is an excellent choice. Burgess added a 19-page introduction to his translation. It focuses mostly on the literary qualities of the Song of Roland; for the first-time reader of the Song of Roland, Harrison's introduction is more helpful. The additional value of the Penguin Classics edition lies in an Appendix with about one third of the original version of the &quot;Chanson de Roland&quot; - the key passages of the work in Old French.<br />While all three translations have their pros and cons, I tend to recommend Harrison's book over the two others. It strikes a good balance between the clarity of Merwin's prose translation and the wooden feel of Burgess's more literal verse translation. In addition, it impresses with its useful introduction and its unbeatable value for money.eyes out of his head. / His brains come spilling out over his feet;&quot; (page 72) While the use of &quot;wrought&quot; and &quot;smite&quot; sounds a bit old-fashioned, &quot;spilling&quot; is an excellent choice.

It provides a fascinating view into the spirit of warriors of that time and their motivation. The Song of Roland gives an idealized picture, of course, and if we can believe the historians, the medieval knights never lived up to their chivalric ideal.<br />The Song of Roland is not commonly included in the canon of must-read classics. Except in France, maybe. I assume the reason is that people in our time do not trace back their roots to the feudalism of the Middle Ages, and that they consider the chapter of chivalry closed after Cervantes's satirical portrait of knighthood in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. In one respect, however, this gory tale of slaughter, martyrdom and revenge is very contemporary. It illustrates the mindset of crusaders who see the world in terms of Good and Evil, and the language they use to incite contempt of the other party.<br />Apart from its historical value, the Song of Roland is also worth reading as literature - as an outstanding example for the heroic epic and as a piece of art whose &quot;simple yet elevated style and tone of high moral purpose&quot; (R. Harrison) is reminiscent of the Old Testament.<br />The three most easily available translations of the Song of Roland in the market are:<br />W.S. Merwin's 1963 prose translation with introduction, re-published in paperback by Random House's &quot;Modern Library&quot; in 2001 (ISBN 0375757112). His nine-page introduction is a succinct but sufficient overview of the historical events of AD 778 that became the basis of the Song of Roland. The translation stands out for its readability, and Merwin's choice of modern English makes the descriptions of violence even more direct and graphic: &quot;And Oliver rides through the battle, with his spear shattered to a stump, charges against Malun, a pagan, breaks his gilded shield with the flowers painted on it, knocks the eyes out of his head and brings his brains tumbling down to his feet.&quot; (page 43).<br />Robert Harrison's 1970 translation for Penguin Book's budget line &quot;Mentor Books&quot; (ISBN 0451528573) captures the throbbing, urgent rhythm of the verse form best: &quot;Olivier now gallops through the fray - / his lance has snapped, he only has a stump - / and goes to strike a pagan, Malsaron. / He breaks his gilt, fleuron-emblazoned shield, / bursting both his eyeball from his head - / his brain comes tumbling downward to his feet - &quot; (page 93). &quot;Fleuron-emblazoned&quot; is quite enigmatic compared to Merwin's clear &quot;with the flowers painted on it&quot;, but Harrison redeems himself by choosing &quot;bursting&quot; to emphasize the violence of the attack. The big plus of Harrison's book is his 42-page introduction. He explains the logic of medieval chivalry, why cruelty coexisted with sensitivity, and butchery with prayer. One interesting concept is the medieval &quot;ethos of success,&quot; or in other words the idea that the outcome justifies the means: When a knight killed another knight it was the will of God that this had happened, no matter by what means. Make the opponent trip and chop off his head - see, God is on your side.

He stays closest to the form of the original, which gives his translation a certain wooden inflexibility but also a not entirely unbecoming pathos. His translation of Olivier's attack on Malun is quite telling: &quot;Oliver rides through the thick of the fray; / His lance shaft is broken, only a stump remains. / He goes to strike a pagan, Malun; / He breaks his shield, wrought with gold and flowers, / and smites both hiseyes out of his head. / His brains come spilling out over his feet;&quot; (page 72) While the use of &quot;wrought&quot; and &quot;smite&quot; sounds a bit old-fashioned, &quot;spilling&quot; is an excellent choice.

The title seems to suggest that the author is an argumentative dissenter - and the reader by implication too, since he seems to enjoy this kind of literature.<br />Then, why read a collection of essays that are for the most part over 70 years old?<br />Firstly, for the clear style and the straightforward logic of Russell. He does not beat about the bush: &quot;My own view on religion is that of Lucretius [a Roman philosopher of the first century BC, author of &quot;On the Nature of the Universe&quot;]. I regard it as a disease born of fear and as a source of untold misery to the human race.&quot;(24). This statement sums it up nicely for Bertrand Russell; and as expected, Russell's answer to the questions in the titles of the essays &quot;Has Religion made useful Contributions to Civilization?&quot; (1930), &quot;Do we survive Death?&quot; (1936), and &quot;Can Religion Cure our Troubles?&quot; (1954) is a resounding NO.<br />Secondly, as a warning how overly optimistic we tend to be when it comes to improving human beings by scientific means. Today, some people think that humans can be genetically &quot;improved&quot;. In the 1930s, some people - including Russell - thought &quot;that hatred and fear can, with our present psychological knowledge and our present industrial technique, be eliminated altogether from human life.&quot;(45) Well, three quarters of a century later we still live in a time of hatred and fear.<br />Thirdly, for the often unusual and surprising angle from which Russell looks at the seemingly familiar. Take the Renaissance and the French writer Michel de Montaigne (1533-1592), for example. The common view is that the Renaissance was the first major step on the way to the rationalism and individualism of the Enlightenment, and Montaigne is perceived as the model of the skeptical, questioning, self-reflective intellectual of that time. Russell, however, noticed that &quot;moderns do not always realize to what extent the Renaissance was an anti-intellectual movement. In the Middle Ages it was the custom to prove things; the Renaissance invented the habit of [merely] observing them.&quot; (120) The most perfect example for this anti-intellectual type was &quot;Montaigne, who allowed himself also an intellectual holiday in the shape of hostility to systems and deductions.&quot;(120)<br />Fourthly, because Russell is a worthy heir to the tradition of optimistic materialism going back to David Hume (1711-1776), and because, at his best, he displays the common sense and simple wisdom that does not wear off with the years: &quot;To live a good life in the fullest sense a man must have a good education, friends, love, children (if he desires them), a sufficient income to keep him from want and grave anxiety, good health, and work which is not uninteresting. All these things, in varying degrees, depend upon the community and are helped or hindered by political events. The good life must be lived in a good society and is not fully possible otherwise.&quot;(75)<br />Interestingly, the man who wrote these words about the good life, was judicially declared &quot;unfit&quot; to teach philosophy at the College of the City of New York. A 50-page appendix to the book explains how this happened and provides an interesting case study how - already in 1940 - a vocal minority of ideological extremists in the United States used its influence to push its agenda.f the skeptical, questioning, self-reflective intellectual of that time.

This edition (ISBN 01400595447) comes in a larger format with 32 beautiful colored illustrations of Persian miniature paintings from the 16th and 17th century, and an essay on the history of the miniatures that points out the influence of Chinese painting on Persian graphic arts (an interesting subject in itself). The other edition is the Penguin Classics edition (ISBN 0140443843), which is identical to this edition but lacks the illustrations and the essay on Persian graphic arts. The illustrated, larger sized edition is definitely worth the slightly higher price, in my opinion.<br />A reader who is familiar with FitzGerald's classic \\"re-creation\\" - \\"translation\\" is a term that is too weak in this context - will be surprised at the defiant materialism of Omar Khayyam's quatrains in Avery's literal translation stripped of the poetic spark of FitzGerald's work.<br />For example, while the Victorian gentleman Edward FitzGerald chose to translate Omar Khayyam's praise of simple joys and poetry in his famous \\"A Book of Verses underneath the Bough, / A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread - and Thou / Beside me singing in the Wilderness - / Oh, Wilderness were Paradise enow!\\", Peter Avery gives us not only a more literal translation (#98) but also a much more worldly (and spicy) version of the same theme:<br />If chance supplied a loaf of white bread,<br />Two casks of wine and a leg of mutton,<br />In the corner of a garden with a tulip-cheeked girl<br />There'd be enjoyment no Sultan could outdo. (#234)<br />In his introduction, Peter Avery points out that the ruba'i (quatrain) was the favorite verse form among intellectuals, \\"those philosophers and mystics in eleventh- and twelfth-century Persia who were in some degree non-conformists opposed to religious fanatism, so that they have often been called Islam's free-thinkers.\\" And a free-thinker Omar Khayyam was. He did not believe in the cardinal Muslim tenet of the resurrection of the body after death, and he suggested that drinking wine was better than worrying about abstruse religious theories and dogmas. In an instance that must have been particularly enraging for orthodox Muslims he turned the argument for future rewards in paradise on its head by thinking it through to its logical end:<br />They promise there will be Paradise and the houri-eyed,<br />Where clear wine and honey will flow:<br />Should we prefer wine and a lover, what's the harm?<br />Are not these the final recompense? (#88)<br />(the \\"houri-eyed\\" are beautiful girls, by the way)<br />In another slyly funny (and self-critical) quatrain, Omar Khayyam pushes his skepticism and blunt honesty even further:<br />A religious man said to a whore, \\"You're drunk,<br />Caught every moment in a different snare.\\"<br />She replied, \\"Oh Shaikh, I am what you say,<br />Are you what you seem?\\"(#86)<br />Peter Avery's translations stress the worldly, materialistic side of Omar Khayyam, which is rooted in his conviction that nothing lasts but the joys experienced in the present moment. What I missed in Peter Avery's translations, though, was the joy Omar Khayyam must have felt when he created a new quatrain to remind himself to seize the day, to change his state of mind (that's a polite way of describing \\"to get drunk\\") or just to invent a polished metaphor or rhyme. FitzGerald captured this redeeming poetic beauty of Omar Khayyam's work so well that his rendition of the Rubaiyat remains a benchmark true to the spirit if not the letter of the Persian poet:<br />And that inverted Bowl they call the Sky,<br />Whereunder crawling coop'd we live and die,<br />Lift not your hands to It for help - for It<br />As impotently moves as you or I.<br />(while Avery translates with the intention \\"to give as literal an English version of the Persian originals as readability and intelligibility permit\\":)<br />The good and evil that are in man's heart,<br />The joy and sorrow that are our fortune and destiny,<br />Do not impute them to the wheel of heaven because, in the light of reason,<br />The wheel is a thousand times more helpless than you. (#34)<br />Buy this edition for the invaluable introduction, for the contrast to FitzGerald's rendition, and quite simply to get a feeling for Omar Khayyam's blunt honesty; but do buy a book with FitzGerald's version, preferably the out-of-print edition with English novelist A.S. Byatt's introduction (\\"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\\", ASIN 0965231240).<br />And lest anyone should think Omar Khayyam was only a frivolous, inebriated hedonist, here are two of my favorite quatrains from Peter Avery's and John Heath-Stubbs's book:<br />If the heart could grasp the meaning of life,<br />In death it would know the mystery of God;<br />Today when you are in possession of yourself, you know nothing.<br />Tomorrow when you leave yourself behind, what will you know? (#5)<br />It is we who are the source of our own happiness, the mine of our own sorrow,<br />The repository of justice and foundation of iniquity;<br />We who are cast down and exalted, perfect and defective,<br />At once the rusted mirror and Jamshid's all-seeing cup.

This is a book of rather peculiar interpretations of Omar Khayyam's &quot;Rubaiyat&quot; in the famous translation by Edward FitzGerald. Mr. Yogananda takes the 75 quatrains of the first translation of 1859 and adds to each a paraphrase, an &quot;extended meaning&quot; and what he calls &quot;keys to meaning.&quot;<br />The purpose of this book, however, is to illustrate Mr. Yogananda's beliefs with the poetry of Omar Khayyam, not to explain or comment the quatrains.<br />Quatrain number 52 is one of the most materialistic, even fatalistic, of Omar Khayyam's poems:<br />And that inverted Bowl we call The Sky,<br />Whereunder crawling coop't we live and die,<br />Lift not thy hands to It for help - for It<br />Rolls Impotently on as Thou or I.<br />(in the standard 101 quatrain-edition of Edward FitzGerald this poem is number 72 and reads more correctly: &quot;And that inverted Bowl they call the Sky, / Whereunder crawling coop'd we live and die, / Lift not your hands to It for help - for It / As impotently moves as you or I.&quot;)<br />Mr. Yogananda paraphrases it as &quot;Sun, Moon, stars, and planets pass athwart the sky as though in a slow celestial dance. Their movements correspond to the decrees of the Cosmic Law. Their changing configurations are choreographed, like the events in our lives. The stars and planets themselves can no more choose how they will affect us than we can select our own karmic destinies. Look not to the stars, then, for help if you would change your lot. Look to God. He it was who made you and all the stars. He it was who first determined the workings of karmic law.&quot;<br />God and &quot;karmic law&quot; figure prominently in Mr. Yogananda's interpretations of the other quatrains, too. However, the connection between the poems and Mr. Yogananda's interpretation is in all cases very flimsy and arbitrary. In Omar Khayyam's quatrain about the indifference of nature towards human suffering it is definitely far-fetched to claim that he wanted the reader to look to God and remind him of the &quot;karmic law&quot; when he wrote this poem. Rather, it seems the opposite was the case.<br />Omar Khayyam asks many questions about life and life's meaning in his quatrains. Mr. Yogananda claims to have all the answers. I prefer to stay with the questions and find my own answers.

In fact most people only know Omar Khayyam for the 101 individual quatrains translated and arranged by Edward Fitzgerald in 1859. Fitzgerald's work was more than an ordinary translation, one critic wrote, it was so inspired that some people believed it was an English poem with Persian allusions.<br />Omar Khayyam writes about the fragility and transience of life,<br />Oh threats of Hell and Hopes of Paradise!<br />One thing at least is certain - this Life flies;<br />One thing is certain and the rest is Lies;<br />The Flower that once has blown for ever dies. (#63)<br />and about the inspiration to be found in wine and friendship:<br />A Book of Verses underneath the Bough,<br />A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread - and Thou<br />Beside me singing in the Wilderness -<br />Oh, Wilderness were Paradise enow! (#12)<br />In his best moments he rises above what some critics saw as cynical lament and reaches an appealing state of amused resignation:<br />Myself when young did eagerly frequent<br />Doctor and Saint, and heard great Argument<br />About it and about: but evermore<br />Came out by the same Door where in I went. (#27)<br />The world of Omar Khayyam - Islamic Persia in the eleventh century - demands some explanation to fully appreciate the poetry. Unfortunately, my edition (Peter Pauper Press, White Plains, NY, 1991) did not contain footnotes to the quatrains and only the shortest of introductions. Scholarly comment is often indicated for key words in poetry. Take the word &quot;wine&quot;, for example. It is interesting to be reminded that the subject of wine was inflammable because wine and drunkenness were prohibited by the principles of Islamic law. However, &quot;wine&quot; can also be interpreted as a metaphor referring to spiritual or romantic intoxication.<br />Bottom-line: I recommend to enjoy this book with a glass of full-bodied Italian red wine of the sort the Italians like to call &quot;wine for meditation.&quot;n red wine of the sort the Italians like to call &quot;wine for meditation.&quot;	2004-01-04

His friend the cricket knows how to play the music that inspires Gerald to dance like John Travolta in his best days. Gerald is transformed because \\"we all can dance ... when we find music that we love.\\"<br />\\"Giraffes Can't Dance\\" is my personal favorite among Max's books. The story is familiar to many kids who go to kindergarten and learn that their peers can be picky about who belongs to the pack and who does not. In the book, the exuberant illustrations of Guy Parker-Rees take the sting out of Gerald's initial rejection by the other animals. Watching the Rhinos rock'n'roll and the lions \\"dance a tango that was elegant and bold,\\" balances Gerald's sadness. The emphasis of the story is on Gerald's joyful transformation, anyway. Just read Gerald's jubilant \\"I am dancing! Yes, I'm dancing! I AM DANCING!\\" with enough liveliness and watch the kids identify with a flying giraffe. After all, the lesson is that you can excel and enjoy who you are even if, at first, the world does not play your tune. With a little help from his friends, Gerald finds out that \\"sometimes when you're different you just need a different song.\\"<br />Let me add one short paragraph on Gerald's helpful friends, the cricket and the three small bugs that are hiding on every page. These four little fellows are an ingenious device to soften the impact of the emotional story. Kids are in love with details; once they know what to look for, they will tirelessly search for the bugs and the cricket, and point them out to you. Hint: play dumb and they will have a party.	2003-12-29

A shopping center carries his name, a subway station, a school, a hotel, and even the business class of Singapore Airlines has been branded &quot;Raffles Class.&quot;<br />It comes as a bit of a surprise, then, that the city of Singapore features prominently in only one short chapter in Nigel Barley's &quot;In the Footsteps of Stamford Raffles,&quot; which is the title of the English edition I have read. Penguin Books has probably realized that the title &quot;The Duke of Puddle Dock&quot; (a moniker evoking Raffles's humble background and high ambitions) is a bit unfortunate when it comes to marketing this hybrid between a travel book and a biography.<br />By far the largest part of the book deals with Indonesia. Barley interweaves accounts of his travels with biographical pieces about Raffles and Sukarno, the first president of Indonesia after the country became independent after World War II. Barley quotes extensively from the primary biographical material he used for the book. Both the &quot;woven&quot; structure and the long quotes make it difficult for the reader to really become engrossed in the life of Raffles. Perhaps Barley wanted to create some distance between the modern reader and his 18th century subject. In this case, however, the distance becomes such a gap that it is easy for the reader to lose interest in the book itself.<br />The Raffles who emerges from this book is most of all a man longing for recognition; a paternalistic officer of the British East India Company, good natured, benevolent, optimistic, learned, not very good at handling opposition, but very open-minded about what he sees in the Far East. Humanistic and dedicated to accumulating knowledge, he is not even thwarted by the loss of three of his four children or of all his treasures. When the ship on which he wanted to return to England sank off the coast of Sumatra, he lost his entire natural history collection: &quot;One hundred and twenty-two cases of 'curiosities' were destroyed as well as all Raffles's papers. It was enough to break most men. But, as always, his greatest comfort was the love shown by his former subjects. The morning after their return to Bengkulu he began to redraw the maps he had been working on for years and sent locals into the forests to begin collecting specimens anew.&quot; (255) When Raffles finally returned to England and died at the age of 45, he left almost nothing. &quot;Raffles had been unusual in spending freely on science and learning and had never stinted on creature comforts and hospitality, signs not of love of luxury but rather largeness of spirit.&quot; (264)<br />Barley is an entertaining writer with a fine sense of humor. Had he devoted more space to the historical background of the late 18th century and England's emerging imperialism in South East Asia, I would have enjoyed the book even more. One thing to remember from this book, though, is definitely Barley's description of the Durian, a local fruit beloved by Singaporeans for its taste and prestigious price: &quot;the fruit like a football-sized conker, whose taste is halfway between caramel and swamp-water, with an after-whiff of rancid armpits.&quot; (135)and twenty-two cases of 'curiosities' were destroyed as well as all Raffles's papers.

It is a big misunderstanding. The book does not denounce globalization as such, but only the way the IMF mismanaged the economic crises that erupted during the process of globalization. Stieglitz is quite clear about this: &quot;I believe that globalization - the removal of barriers to free trade and the closer integration of national economies - can be a force for good and that it has the POTENTIAL [in italics in the original text] to enrich everyone in the world, particularly the poor.&quot; (ix)<br />Stieglitz criticizes in his book the dogmatic, ignorant and impatient approach of the IMF to managing crises and system changes. The Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 and the reforms in Russia in the 1990s provide him with his case studies. What emerges from these case studies is that the IMF<br />(1) tried to apply a &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; model to all countries (essentially blindly applying the lessons learned in Latin America in the 1980s, which was that crises are caused by loose monetary policies and imprudent fiscal policies);<br />(2) privatized at all cost, even when there was no regulatory structure in place;<br />(3) deepened the crisis of the real economy by enforcing a monetary contraction (which reminds me of the practice of applying leeches to cure a patient suffering from a high fever - state-of-the-art medicine in the 18th century but absolutely counterproductive);<br />(4) was partially responsible for the onset of the Asian financial crisis through the enforcement of excessively rapid financial and capital market liberalization;<br />(5) ignored matters of sequencing by blithely assuming that once property rights were established all else would follow naturally &quot;including the institutions and the kinds of legal structures that make market economies work&quot; (73).<br />Eventually the IMF's mismanagement of economic crises is a result of the dominating role of market fundamentalists in the IMF who believe that markets by and large work well and that governments by and large work badly. Which is very ironic because the IMF was conceived to deal with situations where markets failed and global concerted action was called for (the prime example being the Great Depression of the 1930s).<br />Stieglitz's book is important because it stresses that local conditions and market imperfections have to be addressed before liberalization and privatization can take place; he argues for controlling the pace and the sequencing of opening an economy to the forces of international market economics, not for protectionism; and he does not share the hostility against multinational companies felt by most opponents of globalization. But these fine points are lost on most readers, even the Newsweek journalists who recently alleged that &quot;Joseph Stieglitz, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, argues that developing countries should have looked to protectionist Asia countries, such as Japan and Korea, as their models for development and not thrown open their economies prematurely to ravages of multinationals.&quot;<br />Bottom-line: an eye-opener about the ideology ruling the IMF, not an in-depth study of globalization, but well worth reading.; (73).<br />Eventually the IMF's mismanagement of economic crises is a result of the dominating role of market fundamentalists in the IMF who believe that markets by and large work well and that governments by and large work badly.

In Iran (what once was Persia) Saadi is revered as one of the foremost poets of Persian culture. His works are part of world literature and have inspired Western authors like Diderot, Voltaire, Hugo and Balzac. Goethe included adaptations from Saadi in the \\"West-Oestlicher Divan\\". In the United States, Ralph Waldo Emerson addressed a poem of his own to Saadi.<br />\\"The Orchard\\" is entirely in verse (epic metre) and consists of stories illustrating the standard virtues recommended to Muslims (justice, benevolence, spiritual love, humility, resignation, contentment, education, gratitude, repentance and prayer) as well as of reflections on the behavior of dervishes and their ecstatic practices.<br />Saadi of Shiraz organized the book in 10 chapters, one chapter for each virtue. It turns out that this edition of \\"The Orchard\\" contains only the first 4 chapters. Amazon is not to blame for saying that this edition contains \\"Books I and II\\" of \\"The Orchard.\\" The dust cover makes the same claim.<br />Surprisingly for a work of world literature, there is no complete translation of \\"The Orchard\\" in print. The web boasts a complete translation, which turns out to cover all 10 Chapters but omits substantial parts of each chapter. Islamic mystics do not sell well in English speaking countries after 9/11, so there may not be a good comprehensive translation soon.<br />The Persian language of Saadi of Shiraz apparently is not easy to translate. His prose style, we are told on the highly recommended website \\"[...]\\", is simple but impossible to imitate, flowing quite naturally and effortlessly. Its simplicity, however, is grounded in a semantic web consisting of synonymy, homophony, and oxymoron buttressed by internal rhythm and external rhyme.<br />However, there is nothing that cannot be translated (with the unavoidable distortions for sure - all translators are traitors of the text). There have been excellent translations of Chinese Tang Dynasty poets, why should there be no good, enjoyable translations of a Persian poet of the stature of Saadi of Shiraz? At the moment though, there is virtually no translation I could recommend.<br />The translation by Mirza Aqil-Hussain for this edition of \\"The Orchard\\" is clumsy and often opaque. It appears to cling too closely to the original and lacks the creative freedom necessary to make an ancient text accessible and enjoyable for modern readers. Also, an introductory chapter on the background of Saadi of Shiraz and the tradition of Persian Sufi writing is sorely missing from this edition.<br />Here are some examples to illustrate my point:<br />When Mirza translates \\"The skin of the date is full of sweetness / But when you remove it, there is a stone within\\"(12) the choice of verb (\\"remove\\") is not only uninspired and dull, the translation also does not help the reader grasp the meaning of the image. In another translation on the web these lines read \\"His verses are like dates encrusted with sugar - when opened, a stone is revealed inside.\\" And a short explanation tells the reader that \\"stone\\" is meant to allude to \\"truth,\\" as in \\"a kernel of truth.\\"<br />Another telling example is Mirza's translation of the beginning of a story: \\"I have heard that in the days of Hatim / There was a fleet-footed fumy horse in his stable\\"(119). This passage reads in another translation \\"Hatam Taei possessed a horse whose fleetness was as that of the morning breeze.\\" From the glossary to this story I learn that the original Persian must have said that the horse was as fast as \\"smoke.\\" Mirza's choice of \\"fumy\\" was probably inspired by \\"smoke,\\" and the f-f-f alliteration most likely refers to the sound of blowing, or of a horse running very fast. These are very intelligent choices for a translation. However, in the end the image of a \\"fleet-footed fumy horse\\" is rather awkward in comparisonto the more freely chosen \\"morning breeze.\\"<br />Shiraz of Saadi used \\"smoke\\" because later in the story the fast and beautiful horse literally goes up in smoke. It is being sacrificed as a welcome meal to guests who came to admire the horse, because the host has no other meat to offer and values generosity to his guests higher than the possession a very precious horse (which is the morale of the story). Maybe the most appropriate translation would have been \\"Hatim possessed a horse as swift as vanishing smoke.\\"<br />Bottom line: to enjoy the fruits from this orchard we need to take a different road.on to the more freely chosen \\"morning breeze.\\"<br />Shiraz of Saadi used \\"smoke\\" because later in the story the fast and beautiful horse literally goes up in smoke.

The book is excellently researched, well documented (60 pages of notes accompany 300 pages of text) and profits from a wealth of experience gathered &quot;on the ground.&quot;<br />The main thesis of the book is that many big Western companies substitute a blurry, optimistic picture of a vast potential market for a balanced view based on hard data. When it comes to China, wishful thinking replaces critical distance and realistic assessment.<br />One thing that &quot;The China Dream&quot; explains very clearly is the extent to which two economies in China exist parallel to each other. One is the old socialist economy that is protected from change and the market forces. The other is a vibrant, export -oriented economy of manufacturing plants that assemble goods under the management of mostly Taiwanese and Hong Kong companies. The latter is the poster child for China, but the former continues to gobble up the people's savings to churn out the products that the planners want to see. Stripped of the success story of the export-oriented manufacturing companies, China's economy looks like a disaster waiting to happen.<br />Studwell is not a China-basher. He admires the stamina and determination of the small entrepreneurs in China who manage to hold their ground against a rapacious bureaucracy, the lack of credit from state-owned banks and the dumping strategies of pampered state-owned enterprises.<br />Earlier reviewers have criticized &quot;The China Dream&quot; as biased and uninformed (no CEO interviews). Having worked in China for three years, my impression is that Joe Studwell has a very solid grasp of the economic and political realities in the People's Republic of China, and that there is no point in listening to the rosy projections of CEOs and foreign luminaries who were &quot;toured about in government limousines and fed an endless diet of spurious statistics&quot;(255).<br />In a nutshell: This book is absolutely recommended reading for anyone who wishes to work in China or just wants to know what to make of all the praise lavished on a socialist developing country.of CEOs and foreign luminaries who were &quot;toured about in government limousines and fed an endless diet of spurious statistics&quot;(255).<br />In a nutshell: This book is absolutely recommended reading for anyone who wishes to work in China or just wants to know what to make of all the praise lavished on a socialist developing country.	2003-10-30

I found it uninspired and dull. After the enjoyable volume about India in the same series, this contribution was a real letdown.<br />For the most part, Mr. Haw wrote a political history of China with the obligatory excursions into Confucianism, Daoism and Buddhism (and, I have to say, a very apt comparison of Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhism on page 87). Chinese literature is not mentioned in a single line - not even the world-class poetry of the Tang era. Apparently, the author wrote a &quot;cultural history&quot; of China before this book and incorporated part of it here. How can that be?<br />The condensation of about 3,600 years of Chinese civilization into 250 pages does not serve the subject well. Generalizations and vapid statements abound. Causes of developments are rarely explained, and more questions arise than are answered. For example when Haw writes about the south of China during the Song dynasty around AD 1000: &quot;The south of China, formerly sparsely populated and poorly developed, had by this time advanced to a much higher economic level, largely as a result of considerable settlement by Chinese from the north.&quot;(113) Advanced, by what means? A much higher economic level, what is that exactly? What is &quot;considerable&quot;? Why does settlement advance an economy and how?<br />Economics are not the strength of Mr. Haw. Sometimes he misses obvious links - for example the interrelated economics of tea and opium in the Opium Wars, so well explained in Simon Winchester's &quot;The River at the Center of the World.&quot; At other times he rehashes the babble of local Chinese newspapers, like the assertion that &quot;China will almost certainly become the world's largest economy during the next decade.&quot;(248) I did the math when I heard this fairy tale for the first time while I worked in Shanghai. If China grows by 7% every year, and the US by 2.5%, China's GDP will reach 19% of the US GDP in 2010. In 2032, China will have reached 50% of the US GDP. Please send me an email to get the calculation on an EXCEL sheet if you don't believe the numbers.<br />The author seems a bit infatuated with Communist propaganda, too. The Tian An Men massacre is the &quot;Tianan Men Incident&quot; - it does not get any more politically correct in the PRC than this. Even more embarrassing is the fact that he trumpets the party line by saying that soldiers killed in self-defense (&quot;it seems likely that troops were attacked with petrol bombs and possibly other weapons before they opened fire&quot;(199)) and then sets off 400 killed civilians against &quot;some 600 military fatalities&quot; (199).<br />Another favorite idea of the Communist regime in China, which Mr. Haw parrots, is that &quot;the general level of education in China is probably still too low for any genuinely democratic system to be successful: as many as a quarter of the population remain illiterate or semi-literate.&quot;(199) In reply to that I can say that there are democracies that continue to function even if more than HALF of the population do not participate in the process of voting, i.e. remain politically illiterate or semi-literate.<br />Finally, Mr. Haw is one awful storyteller. How can anyone NOT elaborate on a summary description like this: &quot;In 1870 there was a dreadful incident in Tianjin, sparked off by the stupid behaviour of the French consul, as a result of which he and his assistant were murdered by a mob...&quot;(170)? Give me the details, pleeeease!<br />To illustrate my point, here is the bland version of the Silk Road's impact on Rome (Stephen G. Haw, China, 2002: page 84): &quot;The Silk Road, along which Chinese silks reached Rome, was the major channel of communication between the Far East and the West throughout the Han dynasty.&quot;<br />Here comes the spicy version: &quot;The story of the western world's fascination with China dates back more than 2,000 years and it began with a product that still symbolizes the relationship - silk. The Chinese fabric spun into sensual, thin gauze first became familiar in Rome around 50 BC. Cleopatra, mistress of Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, and queen of Egypt, was among the first to promote a fashion for transparent dresses in the exotic fabric. Despite the outrage of sartorial conservatives - the writer Seneca railed against the wearing of such dresses in the Roman capital, 'clad in which no woman could honestly swear she is not naked' - by the end of the fourth century, silk was a universal accoutrement in civilized society throughout the empire.&quot; (Joe Studwell, The China Dream, 2003: page 3).dates back more than 2,000 years and it began with a product that still symbolizes the relationship - silk.

This goes very much against the left-wing academic belief in the evil effects of globalization and the power of predatory multinational companies (as propounded, for example, in Naomi Klein's recent \\"Fences and Windows\\"). De Soto implies that the governments of developing countries are largely responsible for the sorry state of their economies. And he thinks that the impact of multilateral institutions (like the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund), multinational corporations, and charitable donors (including the development funds from Western governments) is limited. This can be construed to be an argument for reducing payments to developing nations. Which is also why De Soto is popular with the conservative establishment and found Maggie Thatcher and Richard Nixon among his early supporters in the 1980s.<br />However, there is a twist to De Soto's argument in \\"The Mystery of Capital\\". He is not a laissez-faire economist who wants the economy to self-regulate itself. Quite the contrary - it is the government that has to take action and implement and enforce the legal structure. In his opinion, the government should even legalize the existing illegal property arrangements. In the end, he argues, this is just what was done in the United States to very positive effect in the past when U.S. law gradually integrated extralegal arrangements to bring about a peaceful order. De Soto is not a die-hard capitalist, and he does not view capitalism as a credo. Much more important for him are \\"freedom, compassion for the poor, respect for the social contract, and equal opportunity. But for the moment, to achieve these goals, capitalism is the only game in town. It is the only system we know that provides us with the tools required to create massive surplus value.\\"(228)<br />The big achievement of De Soto's work lies in demonstrating the value of a functioning legal system and good governance by actually calculating how much time and money is needed to set up a simple business in a developing country. In \\"The Mystery of Capitalism\\" De Soto puts a price tag on the potential economic prosperity that a country could enjoy if it had a working system of enforceable property laws. The legal system and its enforcement were so much taken for granted in developed Western economies that economists never calculated their value in terms of money. De Soto identifies the cost of red tape and ineffective laws. Then he goes on to try to calculate the untapped savings that lie frozen in illegal property: \\"The value of savings among the poor is, in fact, immense - forty times [!] all the foreign aid received throughout the world since 1945.\\" Even though one might question some assumptions in the calculations, the dimensions of the untapped potential are mind-boggling.<br />\\"The Mystery of Capital\\" illustrates that De Soto is a gifted writer and a charismatic salesman of his ideas. He makes such a forceful, cogent argument that his message threatens to blot out the voices of other economists who justly complain that property-titling alone will not bring prosperity to developing countries and that he is selling a simplistic universal solution to many different, often culturally specific, obstacles to capitalism.<br />Not least because of the controversy it has created, \\"The Mystery of Capital\\" is a very important and influential book.

But one thing that we do learn from Borges is what a pleasure it is to be able to find beauty in poetry (and prose). Borges was an amazing man - he was almost seventy when he delivered these six lectures, and he did it without the help of notes since his poor eyesight made it impossible for him to read.<br />For Borges, poetry is essentially undefinable. It flows like Heraklit's river - the meaning of words shifts with time, and readers' appreciation changes over the years. Poetry as he understands it is a riddle because it is beyond rational understanding; it is 'true' in a higher (magical) sense. And what is true in a higher sense remains unfathomable, a riddle: &quot;we KNOW what poetry is. We know it so well that we cannot define it in other words, even as we cannot define the taste of coffee, the color red or yellow, or the meaning of anger, of love, of hatred, of the sunrise, of the sunset, or of our love for our country. These things are so deep in us that they can be expressed only by those common symbols that we share. So why should we need other words [to define what poetry is]?&quot;(18)<br />Metaphors, according to Borges, are the core of poetry, closer to the magic source of words than any other artistic means of expression. Metaphors are so powerful because for him &quot;anything suggested is far more effective than anything laid down. Perhaps the human mind has a tendency to deny a statement. Remember what Emerson said: arguments convince nobody. They convince nobody because they are presented as arguments.&quot;(31)<br />My favorite lecture is the fourth, 'Word-Music and Translation.' It is a real gem. I will not quote Borges on how word-music can be rendered in translation; just a short quote to illustrate how magnificently language can be translated by an inspired translator of genius. When Geoffrey Chaucer in the 14th century translated 'ars longa, vita brevis,' (art is long, life is short) he chose a stunning interpretation with 'the lyf so short, the craft so long to lerne.' Borges comments that here we get &quot;not only the statement but also the very music of wistfulness. We can see that the poet is not merely thinking of the arduous art and of the brevity of life; he is also feeling it. This is given by the apparently invisible, inaudible keyword - the word 'so.' 'The lyf SO short, the craft SO long to lerne.'&quot;(62) One small word, and it makes all the difference.<br />And since I prefer translations true to the spirit over translations true to the letter, I was pleased to learn from Borges that all through the Middle Ages, people thought of translation not in terms of a literal rendering but in terms of something being re-created.<br />I do believe that these lectures speak of the wisdom of Borges; not in spite of, but because of the contradictions in the text. Here we meet a man in full; a man who stresses the irrational in poetry and the immediacy of experiencing it, yet proves by his own example how the experience of poetry grows with the plain, rational knowledge about poetry that we gather over the years. Borges is also a man who lives in literature. He finds new beauty in poetry because he continues to change every day.

Borges comments that here we get &quot;not only the statement but also the very music of wistfulness. We can see that the poet is not merely thinking of the arduous art and of the brevity of life; he is also feeling it. This is given by the apparently invisible, inaudible keyword - the word 'so.' 'The lyf SO short, the craft SO long to lerne.'&quot;(62) One small word, and it makes all the difference.  <br />And since I prefer translations true to the spirit over translations true to the letter, I was pleased to learn from Borges that all through the Middle Ages, people thought of translation not in terms of a literal rendering but in terms of something being re-created.<br />I do believe that these lectures speak of the wisdom of Borges; not in spite of, but because of the contradictions in the text. Here we meet a man in full; a man who stresses the irrational in poetry and the immediacy of experiencing it, yet proves by his own example how the experience of poetry grows with the plain, rational knowledge about poetry that we gather over the years. Borges is also a man who lives in literature. He finds new beauty in poetry because he continues to change every day. And this is perhaps the most inspiring message of his lectures: people who continue to enjoy changing with the new things they learn 'turn not older with years, but newer every day,' as Emily Dickinson phrased it.	2003-06-11

In fact, most psychologists would agree that it is virtually impossible for a person to understand his or her own motivation - and consequently that it is not possible to understand the full scope of motivation of another person. Therefore it would be asking too much from this book to give an answer to the question why we do what we do.<br />What the book does is summarize findings in the psychology of self-determination and intrinsic motivation, the main fields of research of the author, who has published two books on this subject previously.<br />Deci starts from the position that individuals have something that can be called a &quot;true self,&quot; and that people wish to act in accord with this &quot;true self.&quot; They wish to be autonomous (authentic) rather than controlled. If they act autonomously (authentically), they are self-motivated. If they act autonomously, they also respect others because the &quot;true self&quot; wishes to be related to others (a point on which Aristoteles would have agreed, and Thomas Hobbes would have strongly disagreed). Deci assumes that human beings are cooperative by nature, rather than competitive.<br />The &quot;true self,&quot; of course, is an artificial construct, a theory. And even if we assume that there is such a &quot;true self,&quot; it is conceivable that there are people whose &quot;true self&quot; is competitive as well as people whose &quot;true self&quot; is cooperative. Some people may simply enjoy open confrontations whereas other people may abhor disharmony and clashes. Deci's book is mostly silent about such issues of personality, and his assumption that the &quot;true self&quot; is expressive of human connectedness is just that - a very general assumption.<br />Deci's book builds on the theories of an American school of psychology called &quot;Humanistic Psychology.&quot; One of the most important proponents of this school was Abraham Maslow (1908-1970) who pioneered the concept of &quot;self-actualization,&quot; a technical term for what Nietzsche once called &quot;becoming who you are.&quot; Maslow's book &quot;Motivation and Personality&quot; (1954) is still well worth reading.<br />So, what does this book tell us if it does not tell us why we do what we do? It tells us - quite convincingly - that control is always second-best to autonomy. Deci's core thesis is that &quot;self-motivation, rather than external motivation, is at the heart of creativity, responsibility, healthy behavior, and lasting change,&quot; (9) and that &quot;social contexts that support and affirm people's perceived autonomy and perceived competence enhance intrinsic motivation, while social contexts that diminish people's perceived autonomy and perceived competence undermine intrinsic motivation.&quot; (81)<br />This is not exactly rocket science, but it gets interesting when Deci delves into the details of what &quot;autonomy support&quot; means - not permissiveness, but being clear, consistent and setting limits in an understanding, empathic way. He spells this out on about twenty pages in Chapter 10 titled &quot;How to Promote Autonomy,&quot; and I would love to make these pages required reading for parents and managers.<br />In the nature-nurture debate, Deci's focus lies on the nurture side: &quot;Although the social context is ENORMOUSLY important in affecting people's motivation and behavior, people's personalities ALSO affect their motivation and behavior&quot; (184; italics are mine). In fact, Deci is largely silent about matters of personality, or defines it simply as &quot;autonomy orientation,&quot; whereas he discusses the impact of the social context at length.<br />I am very much a fan of humanistic psychology, which has seen its heyday in the 1960s. It conveys important insights into the impact of &quot;nurture&quot; on human beings. But the assumptions of humanistic psychology about what constitutes human natureappear quite unfounded in the 21st century. To make claims about human nature without recourse to genetics, evolutionary theory, twin research, or the biochemistry of the brain is rather futile. In this respect &quot;Why We Do What We Do&quot; is definitely behind the curve (to make up for this I recommend Matt Ridley's &quot;Nature via Nurture: Genes, Experience and What Makes Us Human&quot; (2003) - popular science writing at its best and quite an education).re appear quite unfounded in the 21st century.

They won't find the answer here.<br />\\"What went wrong?\\" is the question asked by the other side, namely the Muslims in the Middle East who saw their relationship with the European \\"infidels\\" reversed in the course of one millennium: \\"At the peak of Islamic power, there was only one civilization that was comparable in the level, quality, and variety of achievement; that was of course China. But Chinese civilization remained essentially local, limited to one region, East Asia, and to one racial group. It was exported to some degree, but only to neighboring and kindred peoples. Islam in contrast created a world civilization, polyethnic, multiracial, international, one might even say intercontinental.\\"(6) Bernard Lewis's short book outlines the reasons behind this reversal without going into too much detail.<br />If I read the book correctly, the seed to the decline and fall of Muslim power was contained in the early success of Islam - the pride and arrogance that comes with the notion of infallibility and superiority, and consequently the unwillingness to learn from the \\"infidels.\\" A second important reason appears to be the religious fervor of Muslims: the secularization that is the basis for Western success was from the beginning pre-empted in the Muslim world by the early successes of Muhammad. What Muhammad, the religious leader, did became the law; and this law was divinely ordained, superior and inflexible.<br />The broad strokes of his narrative are probably the reason for some of the negative criticism the book received from other historians. But all things considered, \\"What Went Wrong?\\" is an excellent introductory text. It reads like a thriller for someone who is not familiar with history from a Muslim point of view. For that reason alone it deserves its status as a best-seller.s a best-seller.	2003-05-03

With a light touch and in mischievously entertaining fashion, the book plays with the fundamentals of the way we understand ourselves: rationality, identity, reality; in sum, all the ways in which we construct coherence from chance, or something from nothing.<br />Luke Rhinehart, the author (in fact, the real author's pseudonym) and narrator of the book, is the ultimate unreliable narrator. Luke's actions are largely dictated by chance. He writes down alternative actions and then tosses dice to determine which action to take. The result, he claims, is freedom to live different sides of his personality. As an author, for example, he lets the dice decide what he should write in his fictional autobiography with the title \\"The Dice Man\\" and what not; and the dice decide when he should lie and when not. Consequently, he announces on page one that he is the author of \\"the lovely first-rate pornographic novel, Naked Before the World\\" only to reveal much later in the book that the dice ordered him not to write about this piece of fiction in \\"The Dice Man.\\" Too bad, dear reader.<br />The book works not only as a send-up of the psychoanalytic profession and the counter-culture of the late 1960s, it also succeeds at creating its own twisted reality - as attested by all the readers who felt that their view of the world had been profoundly changed by this novel.<br />It is ironic that \\"The Dice Man\\" has a cult following while the book makes fun of the cult of Dice Living created by the fictional Luke Rhinehart. In a sense the cult following includes the real author himself who produced a couple of sequels to this book. The irony should not come as a surprise, though. Authors who are seriously unserious run a high risk of creating ironic side effects. One of the earliest examples is the Daoist philosopher Lao-Tse (born BC 604). He blissfully ignored the irony in his \\"Dao De Jing,\\" a book that declares in the first sentence \\"the Dao that can be told is not the real Dao\\" and then goes on for some 5,000 words to explain what the Dao is.<br />In sum, \\"The Dice Man\\" is recommended for readers who are willing to suspend the sense of their own importance for the sake of enjoying a fictional world, and to tolerate an alien system of morality for the time it takes to read this original and amusing satire.ed by the fictional Luke Rhinehart.

In the mid-fifteenth century the social rise of the merchant brought with it an aesthetic of expenditure, and \\"the art of Flanders like the art of Venice celebrated the triumph of worldly goods.\\" (124) She describes at length the emergence of book manufacturing and trading in Europe, because \\"nowhere is the interrelatedness of cultural innovation and shrewd financial exploitation of a new market opportunity more strikingly illustrated than in the emerging book trade.\\" (128)<br />One of the most interesting points she makes appears almost as a footnote. It is the fact that the conspicuous consumption of the European Renaissance is in imitation of the lavish splendor of the rulers of the Muslim Ottoman Empire. \\"Ostentation and authority went hand in hand; to be ostentatious was an important part of being considered a figure of civic worth.\\" (72) To show one's wealth meant to show one's power. Pursuing this idea a bit further, one could argue that the initial spark for the phenomenon of conspicuous consumption in Renaissance Europe came - as so many other things - from the Muslim East.<br />The next question would be, how come this initial spark fired Europe's development but fizzled in the area where it came from? This is largely the story of how innovations are made and spread, and how the European 'newcomers' in the Renaissance caught up with and overtook their Muslim competitors (and models). For this story of comparative economic history, one has to look elsewhere, of course. It is not the focus of Lisa Jardine's book - which is not meant as a criticism.<br />However, there is one minor gripe I have with \\"Worldly Goods.\\" The book is very good at arguing its case, but I felt a bit overwhelmed by the sheer amount of evidence supporting the book's rather uncontroversial, straightforward theses. For my taste, the main ideas of the book are not revolutionary or provocative enough to sustain the long narrative.<br />Overall, \\"Worldly Goods\\" is a successful hybrid of art history and economic history. Maybe art historians will grumble that the book does not paint the full picture of Renaissance Art (it does not), and economic historians will complain that it does not fully explain the mechanics of the rise of capitalism in Renaissance Europe (it does not). But there are other books for that. \\"Worldly Goods\\" delivers what it promises: a cogent and undogmatic study of the influence of economics on Renaissance art.has to look elsewhere, of course.

Norse settlement in Greenland, for example, became impossible because of the cooler temperatures after the 13th century. Famine in rural areas throughout the Middle Ages was also an undisputed consequence of sudden weather shifts. The damage done to the Spanish Armada in 1588 by two savage storms is patently climatic in origin, too.<br />In most cases, however, the climate is just one - mostly minor - factor out of many that contributed to the occurrence of major historical events like the French Revolution, for example. Fagan rightly calls climatic change &quot;a subtle catalyst.&quot; Finally, if we look at historical developments that unfolded over centuries - like the Renaissance or the making of modern Europe - the influence of the climate does not explain anything.<br />A book like Fagan's &quot;The Little Ice Age&quot; is most interesting for historians who examine grass roots history, such as the daily lives of farmers and fishermen in the Middle Ages. At first I thought the climate would provide answers for economic historians, too. But as Fagan shows, the human response to deteriorating weather differs widely from region to region. The conservative French farmers stuck to growing wheat, which is notably intolerant of heavy rainfall, whereas English and Dutch farmers diversified their crop (and became much less vulnerable to bad weather). The weather alone does not explain this development. Obviously, an economic historian who is interested in the question &quot;why are people better off in this country (or region, society, etc.) than elsewhere?&quot; has to look to other factors than the weather when he seeks for answers.<br />So far, the climate has been a footnote in World History. Nonetheless, this footnote can be quite interesting, as &quot;The Little Ice Age&quot; shows. The book is divided into four parts. Part One describes the Medieval Warm Period, roughly from 900 to 1200. Parts Two and Three describe how people reacted to the cooling weather, and how devastating climatic changes are for societies whose agriculture is at subsistence level. Part Four covers the end of the Little Ice Age and the sustained warming of modern times. All four parts make for fascinating, sometimes even disturbing reading; and for the reader new to the field Fagan offers the basic explanations of the effects of oceanic currents and air pressure on the climate in Europe.<br />Bottom line: A good introduction to the subject aimed at the general reading public. It largely exploits earlier literature on the subject, however. And while asking very broad questions, the book bases its answers on a narrow range of data mostly pertaining to northern Europe.not explain this development.

Although the anthology contains one passage by a Malay, and two passages by Japanese authors, it has proved impossible to include any passage written by a Chinese.<br />The book is out of print now, which is probably due to the undramatic and mostly descriptive nature of the travellers' accounts. Someone who has never visited Singapore or did not live in the city will find many of these snapshots of Singapore a bit dull and repetitive.<br />However, this anthology contains three true gems in terms of literary and entertainment value:<br />(1) The excerpt from Alfred Russel Wallace's description of his visit to Singapore, which is full of finely observed details, and recounted with humane warmth and gentle irony. By the way, as the compiler notes, it was in Singapore that Wallace commenced his momentous natural history explorations of the Malayan and Indonesian region that led to the co-formulation with Charles Darwin of the Theory of Natural Selection. Wallace's overview of Singapore's social structure, written in 1862, is the finest such description to be found in the book. He wrote that<br />few places are more interesting to a traveller from Europe than the town and island of Singapore, furnishing, as it does, examples of a variety of Eastern races, and of many different religions and modes of life. The government, the garrison, and the chief merchants are English; but the great mass of the population is Chinese, including some of the wealthiest merchants, the agriculturists of the interior, and most of the mechanics and labourers. The native Malays are usually fishermen and boatmen, and they form the main body of the police. The Portuguese of Malacca supply a large number of the clerks and smaller merchants. The Klings [a Malay term for Indians from Telinga] of Western India are a numerous body of Mahometans [Muslims], and, with many Arabs, are petty merchants and shopkeepers. The grooms and washermen are all Bengalees, and there is a small but highly respectable class of Parsee merchants. Besides these, there are numbers of Javanese sailors and domestic servants, as well as traders from Celebes, Bali, and many other islands of the Archipelago.<br />(2) A passage from the Japanese journalist Tatsuki Fujii's book \\"Singapore Assignment\\" (1943) in which he fumes at what he sees as the signs of British imperialism. For example, he was of the opinion that \\"the poverty of the people increased the longer the British remained in Malaya. The slums of Singapore were world famous and in the midst of all this poverty and filth, the British lived in oblivious splendor.\\" This is in nice contrast to the observation of a British press baron, Lord Northcliffe, who visited Singapore in 1921 and was \\"surprised to find the Chinese living in palaces and the English in very modest houses. The best motor cars are occupied by Chinese - notably the only Rolls-Royce.\\"<br />(3) A six-page extract about the Raffles Hotel from the travel book \\"North of Singapore\\" (1940) by the British civil engineer and travel writer Carveth Wells. It contains one of the best jokes of the anthology, which goes:<br />It is just as well to know what you are buying, especially when you buy anything with Chinese or Japanese lettering upon it. The wife of a prominent diplomat once bought a very elaborate ricksha, in which she insisted upon riding when doing her downtown shopping. Her husband begged her not to use it, but she insisted until he translated the Chinese lettering which was written prominently but decoratively on the sides andback of the ricksha: 'I am a first-class prostitute.

Historical understanding of the Middle Ages is essentially a 20th century phenomenon.<br />Being anything but dark, the Middle Ages were the time of two fascinating Chinese Dynasties, the Tang (618-907) and the Sung (960-1279) both remembered as \\"China's Golden Age;\\" the time of the rise and dominance of Islam in the Middle East (7th-10th century); the Mongol conquest of the largest empire in history (13th century); the blossoming of the Maya civilization (600-800); and the emergence of the first large trading system in the world connecting China, South East Asia, India, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean.<br />The Middle Ages are particularly fascinating because during this time the seeds of today's world system were laid. The answer to the question \\"Why did the civilization of the Western world become so powerful and dominant today?\\" is hidden somewhere in the (not-so) Dark Ages.<br />To paint the story in very broad strokes, after the fall of the Western Roman Empire Western Europe up to the 12th century was, in terms of culture and scientific know-how, a backwater to the civilizations of China and the Islamic Middle East. Beginning in the 12th century however, scientific know-how for commercial and practical purposes was gathered little by little, and trade helped to accumulate wealth in Southern Europe. Indian mathematics arrived in translation from the Arabic in Europe in the 13th century, and \\"Arabic\\" numbers began to replace Roman numerals. The crusades, which began in 1199, exposed Europe to Asian knowledge in papermaking, navigation and medicine. All in all, the transfer of know-how was so substantial that it is quite justified to say that Western Europe at the end of the Middle Ages was deeply in debt to the Islamic world - and not only as a conduit for Chinese and Indian know-how.<br />Commerce and curiosity appear to have driven Europe towards the Renaissance, whereas China's Confucian scholar-bureaucrats in their disdain for commerce ensured that invention and research did not translate into \\"baser\\" products than those needed for statecraft (military and administration).<br />Jeff Hay's \\"The Middle Ages\\" is a textbook with short excerpts from history books - popular and academic - as well as from primary sources like Boccacio, Marco Polo or the great Muslim traveller Ibn Battuta. The excerpts are preceded by a one-page summary of the main theses expounded in the excerpt - very useful for someone who just wishes to browse.

Monsters!\\" I said, \\"No, Max. There are no monsters. They're all asleep. The monsters make night-night when it gets dark. Just like you.\\" Not much use.

Max thinks that is rather funny, and he laughs out loud at their antics.<br />The morning after introducing \\"One Hungry Monster\\" (and its nine friends) to Max, he inquired eagerly, \\"Papa, monsters?\\" And dad said, \\"Yes, Max, you can see the monsters. I get you the monster book. But don't forget to eat your breakfast . . .\\"<br />I love this book!	2003-02-06

Max is two and a half years old, and he is very tolerant of his dad's monkeying around. To judge by the looks I got when I guffawed, it seems that most parents regard reading children's books as a serious matter.<br />Anyway, kids have a great sense of humor, and they will enjoy it when you chuckle while reading this book to them. The little monkeys of the title are five clumsy but well-intentioned, lovable creatures that mess up the house while trying to please their mom. That is probably what happens to many two or three-year-olds who hope to do the right thing and end up spilling the milk when they try to assist mom. Enthusiasm combined with clumsiness can produce some rather chaotic results. \\"Five Little Monkeys with Nothing to Do\\" teaches parents and kids to see the funny side in such mishaps.<br />Recommended for parents and children alike.	2003-02-06

A koan &quot;will mercilessly take away all our intellect and knowledge,&quot; as one Japanese Zen teacher put it. Philip Kapleau finds a gentler phrase: &quot;One of the great virtues of koans is they get us to think, not in an analytical way, but with our complete mind.&quot; (page 27)<br />One of the most famous koans is the question, &quot;What is the sound of one hand clapping?&quot; Another one, in the form of question and answer, is &quot;Does a dog have Buddha nature? - Answer: Wu&quot; (very good as an answer, and very funny once you've got the inside track).  In Philip Kapleau's book &quot;Straight to the Heart of Zen,&quot; the reader encounters some examples of less famous koans.<br />The book presents 11 koans, arranged and edited from taped speeches of the 88-year old Philip Kapleau, one of the foremost American teachers of Zen Buddhism. The audience of the speeches were students with a solid background in the subject. For this reason the book is not, in my opinion, an easy introductory text.<br />My patience with doctrine and jargon is very limited, so I found myself skipping some paragraphs in the book every once in a while. But there are true jewels in this book, too. My favorite jewel is the illustration of a koan with the poem &quot;The Snow Man&quot; by the American poet Wallace Stevens (1879-1955). The koan is called &quot;Layman P'ang's Beautiful Snowflakes&quot;:<br />When Layman P'ang took leave of Yakusan [a famous Chinese Zen master (745-828)] on a snowy winter day, Yakusan asked ten students to escort him to the temple gate to bid him farewell. The Layman, pointing to the falling snowflakes, said, &quot;Beautiful snowflakes - they fall nowhere.&quot; One of the students asked him, &quot;Where do the flakes fall, then?&quot; The Layman slapped him.<br />So where do they fall, then? Here's Wallace Stevens's answer:<br />One must have a mind of winter<br />To regard the frost and the boughs<br />Of the pine-trees crusted with snow;<br />And have been cold a long time<br />To behold the junipers shagged with ice,<br />The spruces rough in the distant glitter<br />Of the January sun; and not to think<br />Of any misery in the sound of the wind.<br />In the sound of a few leaves,<br />Which is the sound of the land<br />Full of the same wind<br />That is blowing in the same bare place<br />For the listener who listens in the snow,<br />And, nothing himself, beholds<br />Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is.<br />But then again, one should not take it so seriously after all:<br />now then, let's go out<br />to enjoy the snow . . . until<br />I slip and fall!<br />(Basho, 5 January 1588)nter<BR>To regard the frost and the boughs<BR>Of the pine-trees crusted with snow;<br />And have been cold a long time<BR>To behold the junipers shagged with ice,<BR>The spruces rough in the distant glitter<br />Of the January sun; and not to think<BR>Of any misery in the sound of the wind.<BR>In the sound of a few leaves,<br />Which is the sound of the land<BR>Full of the same wind<BR>That is blowing in the same bare place<br />For the listener who listens in the snow,<BR>And, nothing himself, beholds<BR>Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is.<br />But then again, one should not take it so seriously after all:<br />now then, let's go out<BR>to enjoy the snow . . . until<BR>I slip and fall!<br />(Basho, 5 January 1588)	2003-02-03

Lewis	In a nutshell, this book argues that the religious view of the world yields the better answers to the question \\"how should we live?\\" than the materialistic view of the world.<br />In one sense the book is right. Human beings search for a meaning in their lives. The evidence is undeniably there that people who have found a \\"meaning\\" live psychologically healthier, happier, more fulfilled lives (except for the fanatics). And religion does indeed provide certainty and a \\"meaning.\\"<br />To prove its argument, the book cites the example of the lives of C. S. Lewis and Sigmund Freud. The religious view of the world is represented by Lewis, the materialistic view of the world by Freud. Lewis's life was unhappy until his conversion to the Christian belief; Freud remained an agnostic all his life, and his life was mostly unhappy. Lewis the believer faced death with equanimity; Freud the agnostic dreaded death until the end. Consequently, the book implies, the religious view of the world is more conducive to a life well lived than the materialistic view of the world.<br />All of this sounds very neat, but there are a number of fallacies in Mr. Nicholi's argument:<br />It is not true that the utility of the religious view of the world in comparison to the materialistic view of the world can be proven by citing the example of C.S. Lewis on the one hand, and Sigmund Freud on the other. The comparison of two other individuals would yield the opposite result: Martin Luther, a prominent proponent of the religious view of the world, for example, was a difficult, troubled individual; David Hume, a prominent proponent of the materialistic view of the world, however, was a sanguine, balanced and happy person. Adam Smith (of \\"Wealth of Nations\\" fame) reported Hume's death to a friend with the words, \\"he died in such a happy composure of mind, that nothing could exceed it.\\"<br />It is not true that Sigmund Freud represents the materialistic view of the world. Psychoanalysis is not really scientific in the sense that its hypotheses are testable (the \\"unconscious\\" is a particularly blatant example of this); in its practical application psychoanalysis has a strong aspect of what the Germans call \\"Seelsorge\\" (caring for the soul) - the traditional domain of priests. In fact, psychoanalysts for the most part carry the banner of their own particular \\"religion.\\"<br />Finally, it is not true that a religious view of the world is necessarily conducive to mental sanity (health). There are quite obvious exceptions. The young men who flew the planes into the World Trade Center, for example, were devout believers but, in my opinion, not \\"sane\\" in the common sense of the word. It is also not a matter of which religion a person believes in. Even the devout belief in the Sermon on the Mount did not prevent certain televangelists from acting outside of the commonly accepted norm of behavior.<br />Bottom-line: A sample of two specimens usually does not provide the correct answers to important questions. But two specimens can be helpful to illustrate a foregone conclusion.y scientific in the sense that its hypotheses are testable (the \\"unconscious\\" is a particularly blatant example of this); in its practical application psychoanalysis has a strong aspect of what the Germans call \\"Seelsorge\\" (caring for the soul) - the traditional domain of priests.

[...]\\"<br />The funniest thing about my copy of the book was that someone who had borrowed it from the library before me had not realized that Lapham had written his \\"Rules of Influence\\" as (sarcastic) advice for sycophants and brownnosers. This unsuspecting reader dutifully marked with an orange highlighter sentences like \\"the first impression is also the last impression, which is why it is important to always wear clean shoes,\\" or \\"seek out the acquaintance of people richer and more important than yourself and never take an interest in people who cannot do you any favors,\\" or \\"Money attaches itself to velocity.

His comment that \\"anyone who spends time working in China eventually comes to doubt even basic facts,\\" sums it up nicely. Ironically, though, his own book abounds with facts. Some of these should be taken with a generous pinch of salt (see the probing review by \\"Brian\\" dated March 10, 2002, for some examples).<br />In China statistics are for the most part propaganda. Even if the newspapers \\"uncover\\" that huge amounts of money have been embezzled, these figures have a function as propaganda; the purpose is to remove certain people (who fell out of favor) from their office. Sadly, the result of the mismanagement of information is that nobody in China, and least of all the so-called planners, knows what is going on. The only way to find out what is \\"real\\" in China is to go there and see for oneself.<br />Jasper Becker's book is a good place to start exploring because he has been a first-hand observer since 1985, when he went to Beijing as the China correspondent for Hong Kong's South China Morning Post (at that time still a reputable, sufficiently independent newspaper). Becker has been fired by the paper in 2001, and I tend to regard this as a sign of integrity.<br />\\"The Chinese\\" is a valuable primer on the bureaucratic origins of the present People's Republic of China, the mandarins' (and Communist cadres') venerable tradition of living off taxes levied on the peasants, the charming ways how to please superiors by cooking the books, and the various instances in which the bureaucratic system failed to perform. Becker shows how the problems of the present originated in the history of China, and highlights the similarities between the Communist rule today and the feudal Emperors of the past.<br />Becker does not go as far as one of the most infamous critics of Communist China, the Taiwanese writer Bo Yang. He wrote a bestseller entitled \\"The Ugly Chinaman\\" and thinks that there is something wrong in the Chinese national character and at the very heart of Chinese culture: \\"Chinese culture, he delighted in telling everyone who came to see him in Taipei, was nothing but a vat of putrefied soy sauce giving off a horrible stench: 'Even if one were to place a fresh peach in a soy sauce vat full of putrescent brine, it would eventually turn into a dry turd.'\\" But any reader will come away from Becker's book with the uncomfortable and disturbing feeling that much in China is rotten to the core, and the prosperity of the coastal cities - foremost Shanghai where I worked for three years - may be built on very shaky ground.<br />\\"The Chinese\\" is comprehensive, informed, critical, and less polemic than \\"The Coming Collapse of China\\" (2001) by Gordon G. Chang, who worked as a lawyer in Shanghai.

It creates a sense of self; it makes fast decisions; it interprets the past; it imagines the future; and yet it is a deceiver of the smartest kind.<br />Let's face it: seeing is not believing. It is the other way around. People usually see only the things they believe in.<br />According to Morgan D. Jones, once we believe something, our favorite mode of operation is to jump to conclusions: &quot;Failure to consider alternatives fully is the most common cause of flawed or incomplete analysis. In other words, we must learn how to keep an open mind - one of the most difficult things we human beings can do.&quot;<br />Morgan D. Jones's book has two parts: (1) a short introduction into the way we habitually think, and the strengths and weaknesses of this process, (2) fourteen &quot;tools&quot; how to address the weaknesses and improve the process of thinking. It is a practical primer on decision-making, a hands-on manual how to structure one's analysis and keep an open mind for alternatives. In short, it tries to teach how to get away from a purely instinctual analysis of a problem to a structured analysis that will, hopefully, yield better results.<br />Bottom-line: lots of value for your money, in particular if you are convinced that you are the most rational decision-maker in town (you'll buy an eye-opener).	2002-10-28

This one is no exception. The &quot;new Asian emperors&quot; of the title are simply the heads of family-owned conglomerates in South East Asia. The Asian financial crisis of 1997 has de-mystified many of them. There is no need to glorify or demonize them; they are smart businessmen who have learned how to prosper in a difficult environment.<br />&quot;The New Asian Emperors&quot; is one of the most easily available books about the way the Overseas Chinese conduct business in South East Asia, and why they are as successful as they are. In a nutshell, the main factors of their success (in the business school jargon called &quot;competitive advantages&quot;) are: (1) a network that provides reliable, informal information in an environment where information is hard to come by, (2) a strong work-ethic and mercantile mind-set, (3) high savings rates combined with the tendency to re-invest savings, (4) a short-term profit outlook with highly liquid assets, (5) an intuitive decision-making style well adapted to the &quot;informational void&quot; of Asia.<br />I think this book gives a lot of helpful suggestions as to why the Overseas Chinese dominate the economies of countries as diverse as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Singapore, even though the Overseas Chinese are minorities in each of these countries except Singapore. Two things in particular make them more successful than most indigenous entrepreneurs: their work ethic and the way they cope with the lack of information. &quot;Overseas Chinese, especially those in Southeast Asia, left China as coolies to work for Chinese and European traders, plantation owners, governments and semi-governmental authorities. They worked hard, lived extremely frugally and saved money until they could strike out on their own [...]. Once the[y] gained some degree of prosperity, they often moved into property-related businesses, and then into any business deemed profitable.&quot; Developing countries often have weak legal systems, lax enforcement of the law, changing policies of the government and a fast-changing economic environment with few reliable available data. Successful Overseas Chinese maneuver in this hazardous business climate by forming close networks of peers, tapping government information by all means available (to put it politely), by acting fast on qualitative rather than quantitative information, and by following-up small successes with more substantial investments in the same area. They don't &quot;go boldly where no-one has gone before&quot;; their success is based on their preference for familiar, regional business ventures.<br />The book also provides information about the weaknesses of the classical family businesses of the Overseas Chinese: their lack of formal organization, their decision-making focus on the patriarch, their local strength and inexperience in the international arena, the lack of resources devoted to brand development - to name just a few.<br />While it is informative, the book still needs some serious editorial work. Headlines that should refer to the ensuing paragraphs are sometimes out of context, the text is repetitious in various instances, and the part about the cultural roots of the Overseas Chinese is at times vacuous. What, for example do we learn from a sentence like &quot;Taoism focuses on the paradoxical duality of all nature, and gaining an understanding of nature through knowledge of that duality and its implications&quot;? If I replace &quot;Taoism&quot; by &quot;Christianity&quot;, &quot;duality&quot; by &quot;Trinity&quot;, and &quot;nature&quot; by &quot;God&quot;, the sentence reads: &quot;Christianity focuses on the paradoxical Trinity of God, and gaining an understanding of God through knowledge of that Trinity and its implications.&quot; This is a sentence that correctly describes one facet of Christianity, but does it help our understanding of Christianity? You guessed the answer.<br />The weakest part of the book is the section about the philosophical and cultural roots of the Overseas Chinese. It is called &quot;Confucianism +&quot; with the &quot;+&quot; standing for Buddhism and Taoism. While Confucianism plays an important role for the work-ethic of the Overseas Chinese, its tenets could as well have hindered the Overseas Chinese from being economically successful. Confucianism is essentially a philosophy for rulers and bureaucrats, and it looks down on the profit motives of merchants who tend to be wary of bureaucrats and their taxation power. It exalts peasants (who stay in their place, can be taxed easily and forced to serve in the army), and it delegates the unruly and evasive merchants to the lowest class in the Confucian system. In this respect, a few explanations are required as to why the stay-at-home Confucian Chinese did not prosper and the Overseas Confucian Chinese did.<br />As an economist I was duly impressed by one quote of an Overseas Chinese tycoon who said to his son: &quot;'Remember that you are responsible to your ancestors, not just to yourself. Our ancestors are not honored by compromise; they are honored by responsible behavior and hard work.'&quot; This quote reminded me very much of Max Weber's thesis in his seminal work &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot; (1904/05). Weber, a German economist and the father of sociology as a science, showed that the Protestant ethic was one of the necessary - but not sufficient - elements for the development of Capitalism in modern nations. Something similar seems to be going on among the Overseas Chinese. It seems that the &quot;practical&quot; Confucian ethic embraced by the Overseas Chinese is, at least in certain respects, quite similar to the Protestant ethic that fuelled the development of a capitalist society. Unfortunately, the book does not elaborate on this subject.<br />Bottom line: There are many morsels of insight in this book, but it needs a much better organization to be enjoyable. The explanations for the success of the Overseas Chinese are convincing, except for the cultural/philosophical ones. Some more anecdotes to illustrate the anlytical points would have been helpful.

US	51801617	R3GHR3OTZ2C6YO	1585790435	508514017	Seven Deadly Sins: Common Reader Edition	Books	4	22	27	N	N	What seven sins and the pursuit of happiness have in common	Sins are definitely out of fashion. The last time I came across the Seven Deadly Sins of Envy, Pride, Covetousness, Gluttony, Sloth, Lust and Anger, it was in a glossy Singaporean magazine for the trendy crowd. Under each of the headings it featured big cars, expensive condos, the current \\"IN\\"-nightspots, the newest restaurants, fashionable jewelry, designer clothes and so on. The word \\"sin\\" may have made monks and Victorians tremble; but we just shiver in anticipation of the latest thrill. Alain de Botton captures this change in attitude perfectly in his 5-page afterword: \\"[Today] our concerns are of a different order. We worry about whether we are cheerful or depressed, fulfilled or low in self-esteem. We worry about happiness, not sin and virtue.\\"<br />\\"The Seven Deadly Sins\\" have originally been published in 1962 by The Sunday Times, and authors from England have written all seven contributions. The book does not rank the sins in any order (rankings are a very American obsession, and it seems the English have not been infected yet in the early sixties). However, it is very fitting for our democratic society to begin with ENVY, Angus Wilson's contribution, and to end the book with ANGER, W. H. Auden's contribution. Envy is the quintessential democratic \\"sin.\\" Alain de Botton reflects that \\"envy comes from comparison and [...] the habit for everyone to compare themselves to everyone else is a particularly modern, democratic one.\\" People envy only those who they feel themselves to be like: \\"There are few successes more unendurable than those of our closest friends [and] it follows that the more people we take to be our equals, the more we will be at risk of dissatisfaction.\\" Which explains why a society of equals does not automatically lead to more happiness for its individual members. Anger is also a very democratic \\"sin\\" because anger tends to arise from a sense of entitlement: \\"We aren't overwhelmed by anger whenever we are denied an object we desire, only when we believe ourselves entitled to obtain it\\" (Alain de Botton). A sense of entitlement comes with democracy: we are not just in pursuit of happiness, we assume we are entitled to it.<br />Wedged between the highlights of Wilson's and Auden's articles are contributions by Edith Sitwell on PRIDE (a tongue-in-cheek confession to the \\"virtue\\" of pride), Cyril Connolly on COVETOUSNESS (a very funny short story about obsessive greed), Patrick Leigh-Fermor on GLUTTONY (an indigestible, rambling piece of writing - skip this part of the menu!), Evelyn Waugh on SLOTH (\\"Sloth is the condition in which a man is fully aware of the proper means of his salvation and refuses to take them,\\" the state of rejecting the \\"spiritual good\\" which - in modern parlance - leads to depression, the contemporary cousin of sloth), and finally Christopher Sykes on LUST (a fine example of British common sense).<br />If we worry about happiness, not sin and virtue, why should we read about \\"The Seven Deadly Sins\\" at all? Why worry about the \\"good\\" when we can go out and have \\"fun\\" instead? The answer is: the \\"good\\" is about the value we attribute to our lives looking forward and looking back, the \\"fun\\" is just living it. In general, we are bad at \\"just living\\" or \\"living in the moment.\\" but experts in reflecting on the past and planning for the future. It is a smart decision to build on our expertise and put some meaning into our lives to make looking back and forward more enjoyable. After all, the good life and the happy life are complementary, not mutually exclusive. Alain de Botton points it out just so well: \\"If we listen to pre-Christian philosophers, there is never a conflict between happiness and goodness. For Socrates, the sinful man is at the same time the miserable man, the good one the happy one. It's only with the arrival of Christianity that a conflict starts to appear and that, unwittingly, it starts to seem as though being good is dull and not likely to lead one to happiness, while sinfulness is bad, but actually rather fun.\\"fulness is bad, but actually rather fun.\\"	2002-10-10

Almost one hundred years later, Gavin Young visited the same places as Conrad. He tracked down the remaining traces of the people who became the inspiration for Conrad's protagonists in his novels. Young visited Jakarta, Borneo and Celebes Island in Indonesia, traveled on a cargo-ship from Singapore to Bangkok, and saw both cities with the eyes of Conrad.<br />Young's account is rich in detail and local atmosphere. His narrative moves leisurely, and his observations of the present merge gently with Conrad's world of the end of the 19th century. Young knows how to evoke the atmosphere of South East Asian cities - here, for example, the waiting-hall in Jakarta harbor: \\"I doubt if there was a square yard of empty floor-space. Standing, sitting, squatting, some lying full-length, propped against hillocks of bags, boxes and baskets of woven leaves, they chatted and laughed, ceaselessly offering each other small, thin cigarettes that filled the thick, humid air with sweet, clove-scented smoke.\\" And every once in a while he shares some arcane but interesting facts with the reader: \\"Makassar [a town on the island of Celebes, Indonesia] profited greatly from Singapore's rise in importance as the halfway trading station between West and East. Trade boomed in every island commodity from pearls and sea slugs to copra, sandalwood and the famous macassar oil which Victorian gentlemen plastered on their hair, obliging their wives to protect the backs of their armchairs with white cloths called antimacassars.\\"<br />Unfortunately, Penguin Books used the smallest font size I have ever encountered in a pocket book to squeeze the narrative on 300 pages. I found the reading extremely tiring.<br />The book will send me back to re-read \\"Almayer's Folly\\" and to give \\"Lord Jim\\" and Joseph Conrad's early stories a try.

That is what I like about poetry. It tolerates different points of view, a multitude of interpretations. A poem, or its translation, is never 'right', it is always the expression of an individual reader's experience at a certain point in his or her life: \\"As no individual reader remains the same, each reading becomes a different - not just another - reading. The same poem cannot be read twice.\\"<br />\\"Nineteen Ways of Looking at Wang Wei: How a Chinese Poem is Translated\\" contains a simple four-line poem, over 1200 years old, written by Wang Wei (c. 700-761 AD), a man of Buddhist belief, known as a painter and calligrapher in his time. The book gives the original text in Chinese characters, a transliteration in the pinyin system, a character-by-character translation, 13 translations in English (written between 1919 and 1978), 2 translations in French, and one particularly beautiful translation in Spanish by Octavio Paz (1914-1998), the Mexican poet who received the 1990 Nobel Prize for literature. Paz has also added a six-page essay on his translation of the poem.<br />Wang Wei's poems are fascinating in their apparent simplicity, their precision of observation, and their philosophical depth. The poem in question here is no exception. I would translate it as:<br />Empty mountains<br />I see no one<br />but I hear echoes<br />of someone's words<br />evening sunlight<br />shines into the deep forest<br />and is reflected<br />on the green mosses above<br />Compared to the translations of Burton Watson (1971), Octavio Paz (1974), and Gary Snyder (1978), this version has a number of flaws. My most flagrant sin is the use of a poetic first person, the \\"I\\", while the original poem merely implies an observer. The translation reflects what I found most intriguing in the original text. First of all, the movement of light and sound, in particular the reflection of light that mirrors the echo of sound earlier in the poem. Secondly, the conspicuous last word of the poem: \\"shang\\"; in Chinese it is a simple three-stroke character that today means 'above' (it is the same \\"shang\\" as in Shanghai ' the city's name means literally 'above the sea').<br />This is a very simple poem. The simplicity is deceptive, though. What looks very natural, still wants to make a point. The point is that looking is just one thing, but being open to echoes and reflections is what really yields new and unexpected experiences. Wang Wei applies the \\"mirror\\" metaphor in a new way in his poem. This metaphor was very popular in Daoist and Buddhist literature, and says roughly that the mind of a wise person should be like a mirror, simply reflective and untainted by emotion. Wang Wei seems to have this metaphor in mind when he mentions echoes and reflections in his poem. A Buddhist or a Daoist, for that matter, would also recognize the principle of \\"Wu Wei\\" (non-action) here: nothing can be forced or kept, everything simply \\"falls\\" to you and will be lost again. In this sense, a person cannot \\"see\\" (as in the activity of seeing); a person can only be \\"struck\\" by the visible (as in being illuminated - the \\"satori\\" of Zen Buddhism).<br />\\"Nineteen Ways of Looking at Wang Wei\\" is a light, unscholarly book - and I mean this as a compliment. It is a pure pleasure to read the different translations together with Weinberger's lucid comments. Weinberger has a wonderful sense of humor to accompany his analytical mind; and he is allergic to pomposity. He enjoys mocking the pompous. This is what he has to say about one translator's misguided efforts to rhyme Wang Wei's poem: \\"line 2 ... adds 'cross' for the rhyme scheme he [the translator] has imposed on himself. (Not much rhymes with 'moss'; it's something of an albatross. But he might have attempted an Elizabethan pastoral 'echoing voices toss' or perhaps a half-Augustan, half-Dada 'echoing voices sauce').\\"<br />In the translation of Chinese poetry, as in everything, Weinberger notes, nothing is more difficult than simplicity.<br />Simplicity is particularly difficult for certain academics, it seems. A professor, who had read Weinberger's comments on Wang Wei's poem in a magazine, furiously complained about the \\"crimes against Chinese poetry\\" Weinberger had allegedly committed by neglecting \\"Boodberg's cedule.\\" Weinberger later discovered that this cryptic reference was to a series of essays privately published by professor Peter A. Boodberg in 1954 and 1955 entitled \\"Cedules from a Berkeley Workshop in Asiatic Philosophy\\" ('cedule' is an obscure word for 'scroll, writing, schedule'). \\"Boodberg ends his 'cedule' with his own version of the poem, which he calls 'a still inadequate, yet philologically correct, rendition ... (with due attention to grapho-syntactic overtones and enjambment)':<br />The empty mountain: to see no men,<br />Barely earminded of men talking - countertones,<br />And antistrophic lights-and-shadows incoming deeper the deep-treed grove<br />Once more to glowlight the blue-green mosses - going up (The empty mountain...)<br />To me this sounds like Gerard Manly Hopkins on L S D, and I am grateful to the furious professor for sending me in search of this, the strangest of the many Weis.\\"toss' or perhaps a half-Augustan, half-Dada 'echoing voices sauce').\\" <br />In the translation of Chinese poetry, as in everything, Weinberger notes, nothing is more difficult than simplicity. <br />Simplicity is particularly difficult for certain academics, it seems.

US	51801617	R31OJJPHEUUHVZ	0880016310	148864781	Letters to My Son on the Love of Books	Books	2	4	4	N	N	Literary mountaineering with a two-year-old	In a nutshell, this is a book of close reading exercises and personal reflections disguised as a long letter to a two-year old boy.  It discusses three novels (Stevenson's Treasure Island, Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, Thomas Bernhard's The Loser) and one poem (T.S. Eliot's The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock) in some detail. Not exactly the kind of bedtime reading a two-year-old enjoys.<br />I appreciate the idea of the book and the intention behind it, but the weaknesses of the book are substantial. Most obvious is the irritating discrepancy between the author's attempt to appear talking to his two-year old son while at the same time penning sentences like \\"In Italy, Holden's transgression is a precursor of 1968, a sort of protest ante litteram, a proto-desecrator of the system, of the social values of his day.\\" That is heady stuff for a two-year old, but definitely good material for an essay in the culture section of the weekly magazine for which the author writes. The tone of the book is that of a well-meaning but somewhat patronizing teacher. There is a strong \\"you-shouldish-ness\\" in the book, which erupts every so often in sentences like \\"You should treasure the good books, and throw away the ones which are not good.\\" Not that this was a very sophisticated suggestion - but there are very few original ideas in the book, anyway. Mr. Cotroneo spends a lot of time recounting the story lines, which is admittedly a bit boring. At other times he indulges in some personal, and nonetheless widespread, prejudices against popular culture (\\"If it happens that the latest and most stupid hit record brings to your mind a fragment of Heraclitus, then it will mean that, on the cultural side, you have nothing to worry at all.\\"), against professionals (\\"And remember, even lawyers, economists, and physicians can only be good lawyers, economists, and physicians if they have truly learned how to read a great poem. If they can't, they're only hacks, extremely mediocre ones.\\") and against small towns (\\"You are also struck by the measured quality [of life in a small town], from which a Baudelaire, a Radiguet, a Wilde, or a Hemingway could never have been born.\\"). All these rather snooty statements combine to bring him across as more sententious, arrogant, and condescending than he probably is.<br />I am convinced Mr. Cotroneo loves his son no less than I love my own two-year old son. But what is the little guy to think of a father who boasts that \\"at the age of fifteen I was reading Joyce, T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land, and much more,\\" but claims at the same time that he has \\"no intention to make you [his son] into a literary mountaineer?\\" Mr. Controneo is all good intentions but sets a bad example himself by name-dropping Joyce, Dante, Augustinus, Borges and many other famous literary luminaries. Why, if he does not want his son to go climbing at such altitudes, does he point out the highest peaks?<br />The redeeming aspects of the book are the author's protectiveness of his son and his professed wish for the boy to enjoy what he does without having to feel forced to excel at it: \\"When you are older you will have to learn a lesson that The Loser can teach you: you must have passion and generosity of spirit to love the things that you do, without trying to obtain a result whatever the cost.\\" When he grows up, his son will also come to understand that his father's \\"Letters to my Son\\" can be read for the most part as a monologue in which his father explains what made his life meaningful, what shaped him, and what he thinks is important in life. Very few fathers care to do that, and the little guy is privileged to have such a father. I just wish his father had not packaged all this in the form of an exhortative letter full of contradictory messages.gainst small towns (\\"You are also struck by the measured quality [of life in a small town], from which a Baudelaire, a Radiguet, a Wilde, or a Hemingway could never have been born.\\").

Usually the answer lies somewhere in the middle. The best translations aim to be true to the spirit without violating the letter more than necessary.<br />David Young, a poet himself, hopes to be true to the spirit of the five poets from the Tang Dynasty (AD 618-906) while at the same time trying to create poetry in a different language and period. The impulse that lies behind his book is to rescue the poets \\"from the often wooden and dogged versions of the scholars\\" and to recreate the beauty and dignity of the poetry in a language used by an American poet at the end of the 20th century. The results are marvelously readable, beautiful translations that I enjoyed more than any other translations of Chinese poetry I have read before or since.<br />Preceding the translations, Young has written a short introduction to each of the poets. These include a discussion of the special qualities of the poets' works and a selection of recommended translations by other English authors.<br />The five poets represented in this book are (1) Wang Wei, a devout Buddhist and the Chinese poet of landscape par excellence who wrote poems of a deeply religious sensibility; (2) Li Po, the Chinese archetype of the \\"bohemian artist and puckish wanderer,\\" a poet beloved for his Taoist unconventionality; (3) Tu Fu, China's greatest poet according to a widely held view because of his technical brilliance and \\"vigorous poetry that manages to transcend unhappiness and melancholy by its enormous range and immense humanity\\"; (4) Li Ho, a poet usually not ranked with the Big Three because he is too innovative and defies classification; and (5) Li Shang-yin, who has a reputation as a decadent versifier but, as Young shows, is a \\"human and humane artist who feels deeply and sees deeply into mysteries of our common existence.\\"<br />One of my favorite poems in this collection is \\"Returning to my cottage.\\" It is a good example of Wang Wei's ability to capture stillness and movement in a landscape, to balance observations of things distant and close by, and to create from these images an atmosphere of serenity tinged with sadness. It is a good example for David Young's style of translation, too:<br />A bell in the distance<br />the sound floats<br />down the valley<br />one by one<br />woodcutters and fishermen<br />stop work, start home<br />the mountains move off<br />into darkness<br />alone, I turn home<br />as great clouds beckon<br />from the horizon<br />the wind stirs delicate vines<br />and water chestnut shoots<br />catkin fluff sails past<br />in the marsh to the east<br />new growth<br />vibrates with color<br />it's sad<br />to walk in the house<br />and shut the door.<br />Bottom line: This is one of the few anthologies of classical Chinese poetry in which the English versions of the poems really sound like poetry. There is nothing of the stiff formality and awkwardness of most other translations that disable the lyric voice of the verses. These translations are full of the beauty and dignity of the Chinese originals.decadent versifier but, as Young shows, is a \\"human and humane artist who feels deeply and sees deeply into mysteries of our common existence.\\"<br />One of my favorite poems in this collection is \\"Returning to my cottage.\\" It is a good example of Wang Wei's ability to capture stillness and movement in a landscape, to balance observations of things distant and close by, and to create from these images an atmosphere of serenity tinged with sadness.

It takes practice. The keys must be mastered. The old score must be committed to memory. It is a skill we can forget. A little noise can make us forget the notes. The best of us is historical; the best of us is fragile. Being human is a second nature which history taught us, and which terror and deprivation can batter us into forgetting.\\"<br />In this slender volume, Michael Ignatieff argues beautifully and eloquently for a modern humanism based on the awareness of what makes us human: our ability to express our needs and our ability to remember and reflect our history. It is also a short history of ideas in the field of political philosophy, ranging from the Stoics to Rousseau.<br />The \\"needs of strangers\\" refer to \\"fraternity,\\" the most difficult of the ideals on the banner of the French Revolution of 1789. \\"Liberty, equality, fraternity\\" still determine to a large extent our modern political discussion. Michael Ignatieff asks to what extent have we achieved \\"fraternity\\" (solidarity, that is), to what extent can we achieve it, at what cost do we achieve it? On his stroll through the history of ideas he discusses the key issues of our social existence against the backdrop of political philosophy: what is our social identity? Is there a natural human identity? What happened to our metaphysical needs in the modern secular society?<br />Ignatieff is not a mystic or a dreamer, however. His views are firmly grounded in the Western philosophical tradition. For him, \\"political utopias are a form of nostalgia for an imagined past projected onto the future as a wish.\\" He is for the most part a realist who thinks we need justice (i.e. equality before the law), we need liberty, and \\"we need as much solidarity as can be reconciled with justice and liberty.\\"<br />Ignatieff's book is not light reading, in particular because the term \\"need\\" is not part of our familiar political vocabulary. Another reason is that Ignatieff is writing against the grain of our times. He speaks about our silences: our \\"silence about the meaning of death,\\" meaning our having shelved the ultimate questions; our silence about human solidarity and dignity, meaning our having relegated all responsibility for the needs of strangers to the welfare system. In our silences, he fears, we risk becoming strangers to our better selves: \\"Our needs are made of words: they come to us in speech, and they can die for lack of expression. Without a public language to help find us our own words, our needs will dry up in silence. It is words only, the common meanings they bear, which give me the right to speak in the name of the strangers at my door. Without a language adequate to this moment we risk losing ourselves in resignation towards the portion of life which has been allotted to us.\\" Or put more bluntly: if we speak only the language of profit and consumption, we will never learn to speak of what we can be as individuals and human beings.<br />For once, I fully agree with the blurb on the cover of a book: Incisive and moving, \\"The Needs of Strangers\\" returns philosophy to its proper place, as a guide to the art of being human.ieff is writing against the grain of our times.

She sorted the transcripts chronologically according to the works to which they refer and compiled them in this small volume. The result is a collection of trivia, charming chatter and gossip related to the poems, stories, plays and novels written by Williams between 1909 and 1957.<br />The subtitle of the book is quite misleading, though. An autobiography (at least in my opinion) tries to impose a certain order or direction or \\"meaning\\" on a life. This book never tries to do any such thing for the poems or the other works. Williams does not say much about how he wrote his poems or what their \\"meaning\\" should be or in which context they stand. That was rather disappointing. But then again, I should not have expected Williams to be an interpreter of his poems in the first place. As a writer he is pragmatic and straightforward, not inclined to introspection, speculation or interpretation.<br />Williams seems to work by instinct, and this method works fine for him. In one interesting example in the book, used by Williams to illustrate a point, he deletes just one line from a nine-line poem - and it is an amazing improvement. His explanation for the deletion, however, is typically bland and uninformative: \\"See how much better it conforms to the page, how much better is looks?\\"<br />What the book conveys quite successfully it Williams's unpretentious way of communicating, his often self-deprecating humor and the ease and pleasure with which he looks back over his almost 50 years of writing. Williams has a mischievous streak in him, too. He enjoys risking a small scandal by putting on the record his thoughts at a poetry reading in Wellesley where the college girls \\"stood on their heels and yelled ... the girls ... my god I was breathless, but I said do you really want more and they said yes so I read what Floss [his wife] knew they would like. They were so adorable. I could have raped them all!\\"<br />\\"I Wanted to Write a Poem\\" is definitely not a must-have book. I have picked out some (but not all) of the raisins I have found in a book that was, overall, quite plain and trite. And it left me with a feeling that the 73-year old Williams is simply a nice, elder gentleman with a sense of humor, a bit of unobtrusive posturing and an easygoing, mostly sanguine temperament. At a certain point in time he must have reached that desirable and pleasant state in which he decided to take himself not too serious anymore.  My favorite quote in this context comes from his wife: \\"Psychiatry? He used to say, 'I'm nuts and everybody knows it,' and let it go at that.\\"would like. They were so adorable.

It does not work on almost every level.<br />First of all, it is supposed to be a satire. According to my dictionary a satire is \\"a literary work in which human vice or folly is attacked through irony, derision or wit.\\" Unfortunately, I could not find much irony, derision or wit in the novel. It trudges along, and its deliberately scientific language and formality do not create any satirical effect at all.<br />Secondly, the novel wants to educate and satirize at the same time. It was quite confusing and tiring for this reader to figure out when to take a fact at face value and when to assume that it was made up. Education goes well with gentle wit and straightforwardness. Satire works best when something is exaggerated and distorted (in this respect, satire is similar to caricature). Blending the educational and the satirical is bound to be difficult. There are examples of a successful blend (take Chapter 6 of Julian Barnes's \\"Flaubert's Parrot\\"), but not in this book.<br /><br />Thirdly, structure. The novel is not - as the blurb claims - \\"a magical blending\\" but rather a messy blunder. It sags under the burden of distracting, long-winded side-stories. The storyline is burdened by deviations into the life of two rapists, an illegitimate granddaughter of Freud, and Mr. Eiffel (of Eiffel Tower fame). For what purpose? What is the joke? I don't get it.<br />Fourthly, characterization. Satire needs a target worth of derision. Since Freud is no longer on the pedestal on which some academics have put him, he does not really qualify as a target. And what about his disciples? Yes, definitely worthy targets. But then the author should have built up at least one fully developed character that deserves ridicule. He failed to do so, however. The narrator and the characters of the book are quite bland and one-dimensional.<br />There is never a moment in which the book achieves the magic of fiction, which is to suspend the reader's belief in the fictional nature of what he reads. The beauty and power of fiction, in this reader's opinion, lie in its manipulative power: to make us believe (paradoxically) that the fiction we read is \\"real\\" although we know it is fiction. Yes, I want to be deceived! In particular by a book where the theme of self-deception (an excellent choice for the theme of a novel, by the way!) figures so prominently.<br />Bottom line: a very unsatisfying, annoying and tedious book.e magic of fiction, which is to suspend the reader's belief in the fictional nature of what he reads.

It has been translated into English as &quot;Mozart: Portrait of a Genius&quot;. Sadly, the translation is out of print.<br /><br />Norbert Elias was a sociologist by profession. Looking at the life of Mozart, he asked what influence did the society in which Mozart grew up have on his development as an artist. Elias did not try to explain the nature of genius in the terms of sociology. He tried to put Mozart's genius in perspective. The German title of the book made this quite clear: &quot;Mozart. Zur Soziologie eines Genies&quot;, which translates roughly as &quot;Mozart: Sociological aspects of a genius&quot;. The charm of the book really lies in the fact that Elias did not try to explain away the mystery of genius.<br /><br />As a small extra for anyone who has ever wondered why so many important composers came from German-speaking countries (Bach, Haendel, Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms, Schumann, etc.), whereas France and England produced few composers of the same stature during this period, Elias's essay has a neat, little theory which provides some answers. It also warms the hearts of economists, by the way.	2002-05-22

He discarded his worldly ties and set off in search of enlightenment.&quot;<br />In 1983, Ma Jian left Beijing to wander through China's rural countryside. For three years he drifted through the bleak Western provinces, the rich Southeastern part of China and through Tibet. He was 30 years old at the time. He intended &quot;Red Dust&quot; to be an account of his finding himself in the loneliness of the journey. It turned out to be the story of his disillusionment not only with Buddhism but also with the ideas he held about the advantages of the simple life. In the end he finds that he wants to give up his solitary wandering and needs &quot;to live in big cities that have hospitals, bookshops and women.&quot;<br />&quot;Red Dust&quot;, published only in 2001, is a starkly realistic portrait of rural China at the beginning of the economic liberalization initiated by Deng Xiaoping in 1979. No Westerner would have been able to describe the life of the common people in the impoverished inner provinces of China as precisely and straightforward as Ma Jian. It is a world that is invisible to Western visitors, even if they speak Mandarin. In that sense, &quot;Red Dust&quot; is not required reading for the average traveler in China. But I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the &quot;hidden&quot; life that the majority of the Chinese really live.<br />&quot;Red Dust&quot; stands out for its unflinching realism and its intimacy with everyday life in China, just as Mark Salzman's &quot;Iron and Silk&quot; (1986) stands out for its sense of humor, Simon Winchester's &quot;The River at the Centre of the World&quot; (1996) for its knowledge and entertaining anecdotes, and Peter Hessler's &quot;River Town&quot; (2001) for its lyrical descriptions of the landscape and its endearing sympathy with the Chinese people.	2002-04-27

Naipaul is a man of strong opinions, and they are often politically incorrect. He is the man who once, infamously, called the Third World the \\"turd world.\\" This book is about one of his early forays into the turd world. I imagine that it did not please the Indian Tourism Board to read that India is \\"the world's largest slum\\" or that Indians are \\"a withered race of men.\\" Not surprisingly, the young Naipaul - just barely into his thirties when he wrote this book - got labeled as a reactionary and a lapdog of the former colonial power in India.<br />Naipaul's bluntness produced a scandal and much misunderstanding. At closer inspection, however, his unflinching look at unpleasant realities (beyond his politically incorrect asides) reveals a man who is deeply troubled by what he sees. When he writes he transforms his anger into lucid, detailed observations. It is a stylistic attribute that also defines his later travel writing about India (\\"India: A Wounded Civilization,\\" 1977; \\"India: A Million Mutinies Now,\\" 1991) and about the predominantly Muslim countries of Asia (\\"Among the Believers: An Islamic Journey\\", 1981; \\"Beyond Belief: Islamic Excursions Among The Converted Peoples\\", 1998).<br /><br />In this early book published in 1964, his working method is revealed in more detail than in the later books. Naipaul decided to write about the flagrantly visible things whose existence is being denied, and about those personal experiences that are fresh and not worn out by having been described by other authors of travelogues.<br />The themes of the first four chapters can be summarized in the words poverty, caste, defecation, and failure. But Naipaul being Naipaul manages to transform the squalor of the world he observes into clean, cold and lucid prose. His language is, for the most part, that of a surgeon who feels neither contempt nor pity when he dissects. Naipaul writes that the \\"sweetness and sadness which can be found in Indian writing and Indian films are a turning away from a too overwhelming reality; they reduce the horror to a warm, virtuous emotion. Indian sentimentality is the opposite of concern.\\" This explains why Naipaul's apparent detachment is so misleading: for Naipaul unsentimental description is - quite unexpectedly for the reader - a way of showing concern.<br />Naipaul is most effective when he is sarcastic. His book sparkles with rhetoric fervor when he quotes Gandhi on the squalor and shortcomings of India and points out that Gandhi's observations are still valid today. Chapter 3, \\"The Colonial,\\" depicts the colonial's view of India. Incidentally, the colonial happens to be Mahatma Gandhi, and Naipaul quotes extensively from Gandhi's early writing. It starts with a quote just below the Chapter heading: \\"Well, India is a country of nonsense.\\" Naipaul effectively turns one of the founding fathers against his successors who, in Naipaul's opinion, let the country rot in its stagnancy. Naipaul feels that India undid Gandhi: \\"He became a mahatma. He was to be reverenced for what he was; his message was irrelevant\\"; and that \\"his failure is there, in his writings: he is still the best guide to India. It is as if, in England, Florence Nightingale had become a saint, honoured by statues, everywhere, her name on every lip; and the hospitals had remained as she had described them.\\"<br />When Naipaul writes about Gandhi, he also characterizes his own way of seeing and writing: \\"He looked at India as no Indian was able to; his vision was direct and the directness was, and is, revolutionary. He sees exactly what the visitor sees; he does not ignore the obvious. He sees the beggars and the shameless pundits and the filth of Banares; he sees the atrocious sanitary habits of doctors, lawyers and journalists. He sees the Indian callousness, the Indian refusal to see. No Indian attitude escapes him, no Indian problem; he looks down to the roots of the static, decayed society. And the picture of India which comes out of his writings and exhortations over more than thirty years still holds: this is the measure of his failure.\\"<br />Bottom-line: opinionated and brilliant as most of Naipaul's writing, surely not a balanced portrait of India in the early 1960s, but definitely a must-read for anyone trying to understand Naipaul, and a good case-study how easy it is to misunderstand the intentions of a writer or how easy it is to use quotations out of context to malign someone.ings and exhortations over more than thirty years still holds: this is the measure of his failure.\\"<br />Bottom-line: opinionated and brilliant as most of Naipaul's writing, surely not a balanced portrait of India in the early 1960s, but definitely a must-read for anyone trying to understand Naipaul, and a good case-study how easy it is to misunderstand the intentions of a writer or how easy it is to use quotations out of context to malign someone.	2002-04-20

Naipaul's \\"An Area of Darkness\\" about his first journey to India, I felt that I needed a more balanced view of the country. This book was just what was called for.<br />\\"A Traveller's History of India\\" was written by a historian from Sri Lanka with an English education. He knows how to give a good overview of the various cultural influences that met and merged in India. His narrative is chronological. It is the best way to illustrate the growth, glory, decline and disappearance of vast empires. It also serves well to refute the Naipaulian idea that there is something particularly evil about the Muslim influence in India. The Islamic believers who invaded India in the 7th century AD shared many things with the Aryan invaders 1500 BC or the Christian invaders in the 18th century AD: they all came, conquered, prospered and some of their influence continues until today. The Aryans brought the caste system and Sanskrit literature; the Muslims built the Taj Mahal, and gave birth to the Urdu language; the Christians built railroads, left a working legal system and administration, and English as a common language that was understood in the whole subcontinent.<br />In one aspect, however, the Islamic invaders were more ruthless than the others. No other invading culture erased a religion as barbarously as Islam uprooted Buddhism in India: \\"The conquest of Bihar [in 1202 AD] saw the systematic destruction of all the remaining Buddhist monasteries and the wanton slaughter of all the monks. [...] The ruthless fanaticism of the new conquerors led to the complete disappearance of Buddhism from the land of its birth.\\"<br />On the other hand, the Muslims exported the decimal system and the symbol zero from India to Europe, both of which later played a crucial role in the development of Western science.<br />Sinharaja Tammita-Delgoda strikes a fair balance between the failures and the successes of the cultures that came to play a role in India. And he has a fine sense of irony when it comes to the impact of the English on India. He notes that the Indian nationalist movement which began in the mid 19th century had its origins in a common identity and a new sense of purpose instilled by the new political and social ideas carried with the English language; and he observes that the discoveries of many British scholars who made it their life's work to unearth the story of India's ancient past gave Indians an important sense of their own identity and a feeling of pride in their past.<br />I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this history of India. My greatest delight - and inspiration to do further research and reading - were succinct portraits like the one of Babur (1483-1530 AD), who was not only the founder of the Muslim Mughal empire but also \\"one of its most fascinating and attractive personalities. A poet and a man of letters, he was also an adventurer of iron nerves and powerful determination. A keen diarist, he recorded his experiences in his memoirs, the Tuzuk-i-Baburi, which are an important source for the history of the period. These memoirs speak of a tremendous zest for life, a man of boundless energy and optimism, a dedicated drunkard and a wholehearted sportsman and polo player. They also reveal an artistic nature of great sensitivity and refinement. Wherever he went Babur laid out Persian gardens, and his memoirs are full of references to the beauties of nature. Cold-blooded and ruthless at times, he was also capable of great generosity and chivalry, and his memories are laced with that rare quality - an endearing sense of humour.\\"sense of irony when it comes to the impact of the English on India.

Meet a protagonist on a pilgrimage through various stages of insanity. Experience that his insanity feels quite sane sometimes. Think about a world where a slaughterhouse becomes a sanctuary. Ask yourself if you would not choose to live in the fourth dimension where time is timeless and death has no dominion if you had seen the senseless slaughter of war. The planet Tralfamadore may be the sane alternative to the planet Earth.<br />\\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" is a fine novel in the tradition of satire and unconventional, innovative writing, best represented by classics like Jonathan Swift's \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" and Laurence Sterne's \\"Tristram Shandy\\". The book can be hilariously funny, but it is deadly serious about dying. In my opinion, the recurrent comment \\"so it goes\\" is just one of the ways in which the anti-hero and the narrator of the book deal with the horror and absurdity of dying.<br />Vonnegut's style is fluid, and the short paragraphs of the book make for easy reading. It is really very enjoyable from a pure \\"reading experience\\" view, despite the non-linear structure and the parts that read like a weird fairy-tale.<br />Of course, there is no moral in the book. What is the morality in war? Violent death makes no sense. Violent death is as absurd as life gets. And absurdity invites laughter. It's the only way to deal with it short of going insane or joining a cult that has All The Answers.<br />And Dresden, this doomed city - how neatly Vonnegut's description of its deceptive, dreamlike splendor summarizes his book: \\"The Americans arrived in Dresden at five in the afternoon. The boxcar doors were opened, and the doorways framed the loveliest city that most of the Americans had ever seen. The skyline was intricate and voluptuous and enchanted and absurd.\\"absurd.\\"	2002-03-25

First of all, the poems consist of ideograms, the so-called &quot;characters&quot;. Vikram Seth's introduction to his book &quot;Three Chinese Poets&quot; has a good example how a Chinese poem looks in the original characters and in pinyin translation, and how a literal, word-by-word translation would sound: &quot;lonely, close, brushwood, door/ vast, face, falling, light/ cranes, nest, pine, tree, everywhere/ men, visit, wicker, gate, few/ tender, bamboo, hold, new, powder/ red, lotus, shed, old, clothes/ at the ford, lantern, fire, rise/ everywhere, water-chestnut, picker, return home.&quot; The freedom given by the lack of grammar stands in stark contrast to the rigid structure of the poem. It consists of eight lines with five Chinese characters in each line. The lines 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 end with rhyme words. Lines 3 and 4 have an identical grammatical word order, as have lines 5 and 6. Also, the images of the poet are symmetrically arranged. In line 1 a closed door stands in contrast to the vast expanse of line 2; line 3 sets the cranes everywhere in contrast to the few visitors of line 4; line 5 sees new powder against the old clothes of line 6. Only lines 7 and 8 do not contain contrasting images but rather an evening scene that reflects the evening scene of lines 1 and 2. Within this finely crafted structure the poet expresses a feeling: loneliness.<br />A translator has two options: to stay true to the Chinese characters and the structure of the original poem, or to stay true to what he feels to be the poetic message of the poem. It is essentially the same problem that a piano player faces when interpreting a sonata by Mozart or Beethoven. Seth chooses the conservative path of staying very close to the original, as he explains in his enjoyable introduction: &quot;I should mention that the poems in this book are not intended as transcreations or free translations, in this sense, attempts to use the originals as trampolines from which to bounce off on to poems of my own [great image, by the way, for the arrogance of some translators]. The famous translations of Ezra Pound, compounded as they are of ignorance of Chinese and valiant self-indulgence, have remained before me as a warning of what to shun. I have preferred mentors who ... admit the primacy of the original and attempt fidelity to it.&quot;<br />Fidelity, however, is not all it takes to make a translation succeed. Sometimes the much lamented and maligned &quot;freedom&quot; of a translation yields better results. This is the case here. Let me compare two translations of a poem called &quot;Moonlit Night&quot; by the Tang Dynasty poet Du Fu (712 - 770 AD) to illustrate my point.<br />Seth translates: &quot;In Fuzhou, far away, my wife is watching/ The moon alone tonight, and my thoughts fill/ With sadness for my children, who can't think/ Of me here in Changan; they're too young still./ Her cloud-soft hair is moist with fragrant mist./ In the clear light her white arms sense the chill./ When will we feel the moonlight dry our tears,/ Leaning together on our window-sill?&quot;<br />For comparison, here the &quot;transcreation&quot; by David Young from his book &quot;Five T'ang Poets&quot; (1990): &quot;Tonight/ in this same moonlight/ my wife is alone at her window// I can hardly bear to think of my children/too young to understand/ why I can't come home to them// her hair must be damp from the mist/ her arms cold jade in the moonlight// when will we stand together/ by those slack curtains/ while the moonlight/ dries the tear-streaks/ on our faces?&quot;<br />Seth's translation keeps the eight-line structure and the rhyme words in lines 2, 4, 6 and 8. He does not give a pinyin (character-by-character) translation of the original poem. Therefore I cannot judge how true to the original his choice of words is. I would assume Young takes more freedom with the words. Young also breaks up the 8-line structure of the poem into a 3-3-2-5-line structure. In doing so he tries to highlight the train of thought of Du Fu: wife, children, beauty of wife, yearning for reunion.<br />The success of Young's translation lies in his bringing out the pain and longing of the poet who is separated from wife and children. This is where Seth fails. How pale is the pain of separation in &quot;and my thoughts fill with sadness for my children&quot; in comparison to &quot;I can hardly bear to think of my children&quot;; and how old-fashioned does it sound to end a poem with &quot;leaning together on our window-sill&quot; rather than with the poignant &quot;while the moonlight dries the tear-streaks on our faces&quot;.<br />The best ancient Chinese poems pack a tremendous amount of emotion into a tight and formal structure. In this they can be compared to Shakespeare's sonnets. These Chinese poets are no lesser poets than Shakespeare is. Translating their poems, the success of the translation must be measured by the extent to which the emotion can be released without destroying the sense of structure in the original poem. Seth's translations with their stress on formal structure and literalness stifle the full emotional impact. The translations focus on the original structure rather than the truth about the human condition that the poet wants to convey to the reader. This is where Young's freer translation yields much better results.<br />The only objection one might raise against Young's translation is that it is reminiscent of a modern poet like William Carlos Williams. But I'd rather have Du Fu's substance in a modern structure than Du Fu's admirable craftsmanship at the expense of the impact his words have on my heart. His emotions are timeless - let them shine through with the help of a little &quot;transcreation&quot;.g also breaks up the 8-line structure of the poem into a 3-3-2-5-line structure.

It is also a book about a friendship that came to an unexpected and painful end.<br />\\"Sir Vidia's Shadow\\" has been widely criticized for being petty and revengeful. Unexpectedly though, it is not. In a very Naipaulian way, Paul Theroux turns his feelings for Naipaul and his sense of loss into detailed description, and in this imitation of Naipaul's style the book is much more a tribute to Naipaul than a work of slander.<br />\\"Sir Vidia's Shadow\\" is at its best when Paul Theroux balances the human weaknesses of Naipaul with his strengths as a writer. For example, when he reminisces, \\"I was a young man in Africa, trying to make my life. He was one of the strangest men I had ever met, and absolutely the most difficult. He was almost unlovable. He was contradictory, he quizzed me incessantly, he challenged everything I said, he demanded attention, he could be petty, he uttered heresies about Africa, he fussed, he mocked, he made his innocent wife cry, he had impossible standards, he was self-important, he was obsessive on the subject of his health. He hated children, music, and dogs. But he was also brilliant, and passionate in his convictions, and to be with him, as a friend or fellow writer, I had always to be at my best.\\"<br />The book is at its worst when Thoreaux tries to analyze Naipaul: \\"I also saw that the man who dislikes children and doesn't have any of his own is probably himself childish, and sees other children as a threat. Vidia was the neediest person I have ever known. He fretted incessantly, couldn't cook, never cleaned, wouldn't drive, demanded help, had to be the center of attention.\\"<br />Naipaul comes across as a passionate, dedicated, inspiring, demanding, meticulous, wide-awake, self-confident writer; but also as an often opinionated, fastidious, haughty, dogmatic, self-important, pompous, stingy, snobbish, garrulous, cruel, misogynistic, pampered, blunt, insensitive, angry, intolerant, mean man.<br />\\"Sir Vidia's Shadow\\" is well-written, entertaining, and contains some prime examples of Naipaulian political incorrectness ('To me, one of the ugliest sights on earth is a pregnant woman') and humor (\\"He said he had once received a letter from Penguin Books addressed to 'V.S.Naipull.' It was from a man named Anthony Mott. Vidia replied, typing on the envelope, 'To A Mutt,' and began his letter, 'Dear Mr. Mutt ...'\\"). My favorite Naipaulian provocation, however, is his claim \\"that book reviews served their purpose but had no lasting value, except for the jokes.\\"nobbish, garrulous, cruel, misogynistic, pampered, blunt, insensitive, angry, intolerant, mean man.<br />\\"Sir Vidia's Shadow\\" is well-written, entertaining, and contains some prime examples of Naipaulian political incorrectness ('To me, one of the ugliest sights on earth is a pregnant woman') and humor (\\"He said he had once received a letter from Penguin Books addressed to 'V.S.Naipull.'

The simple answer is, there is no simple answer. The simplest \\"simple\\" answer is probably, we age because we live, and living wears our bodies out.<br />In order to live we breathe because our bodies use oxygen to convert food into energy. But in the process something called \\"oxidative damage\\" happens to our cells. In other words: we rust. Inevitably. The two other main reasons why bodies wear out are connected to glucose and \\"browning damage\\", and to self-repair mechanisms of our cells that fail to stop and lead to uncontrolled cell growth - what we call \\"cancer\\".<br />The three processes of rusting, browning and cancer are part of aging. They are \\"how\\" we age. But \\"why\\" do we age at all? Why don't we stay healthy for, say, 150 years and then simply drop dead? In very simple terms the reason is: aging is genetic. The genes do not care about the body after the body has served its purpose: to replicate the genes and ensure that they can replicate again. This is called the \\"selfish gene\\" theory, an expression coined by Richard Dawkins.<br />Gerontology, the study of aging, is a field of science in rapid growth. I do not claim to be a specialist; therefore I do not want to go into much detail here. Steven Austad's book explains very well \\"what science is discovering about the body's journey through life\\". He ends his book with a chapter of particular interest for women (\\"Reproductive Aging, Menopause, and Health\\"), and a chapter on our hopes of how to make the best of our ultimate genetic fate (\\"Slowing Aging and Extending Life: Remedies and Expectations\\").<br />Apart from Austad's humor - it can be both droll and dry - I have particularly enjoyed his short portraits of scientists in the field of gerontology and evolutionary biology, such as the geneticist J.B.S. Haldane, the immunologist Peter Medawar, the American scientist Raymond Pearl (who in 1938 produced the first paper analyzing the extent to which smoking reduced life expectancy, but also was of the opinion that people above 50 should forfeit their right to vote, because they would have grown too foolish), the German physiologist Max Rubner, the gerontologist Alex Comfort (who discovered the joy - and profitability - of sex), the biologist John Maynard Smith, and the two-time Nobel prize winner Linus Pauling.<br />Austad's cameo of Max Rubner is my favorite because of its psychological insight into the downside of dedication and narrow focus: \\"The first scientist to investigate the rate-of-living idea in any rigorous fashion was the German physiologist Max Rubner. Rubner could make people very uncomfortable with his Teutonic bluntness. He was noted for his long silences, punctuated with outbursts of aggressively sarcastic humor. But he was also an obsessively precise investigator of the energy contained in food and the use of that energy by animals. Like obsessives everywhere, he felt that the significance of his obsession was underappreciated by others.\\"the opinion that people above 50 should forfeit their right to vote, because they would have grown too foolish), the German physiologist Max Rubner, the gerontologist Alex Comfort (who discovered the joy - and profitability - of sex), the biologist John Maynard Smith, and the two-time Nobel prize winner Linus Pauling. <br />Austad's cameo of Max Rubner is my favorite because of its psychological insight into the downside of dedication and narrow focus: \\"The first scientist to investigate the rate-of-living idea in any rigorous fashion was the German physiologist Max Rubner.

The first sentence of the preface to his book is: &quot;The Six Thinking Hats method may well be the most important change in human thinking for the past twenty-three hundred years.&quot; Digest this and two more pages of obnoxious self-advertisement that follows. Then put the book down. After an hour continue to read the rest of the book. It is worth while.<br />Essentially, &quot;Six Thinking Hats&quot; is about improving communication and decision-making in groups. De Bono's style is accessible, succinct, well-structured and easy to follow. It is not with a certain justification that he claims that &quot;his work is in use equally in board-rooms of some of the world's largest corporations and with four-year-olds in school.&quot; Well, where is the difference, anyway?<br />What de Bono wants to achieve is to structure thinking and make it more effective. &quot;Thinking often proceeds as drift and waffle and reaction to what turns up from moment to moment. [...] Suggestions, judgements, criticism, information and plain emotions are all mixed together in a sort of thinking stew,&quot; he writes. The six &quot;thinking hats&quot; are different ways of looking at an issue that has to be decided: under the white hat one presents the facts, under the red hat one says how one feels about the issue, under the black hat one looks at the negative effects of the decision, under the yellow hat one looks at the positive effects of the decision, under the green hat one thinks of alternatives, and under the blue hat one clarifies which kind of thinking is going on. Overall, thinking becomes clearer when the different parts that go into it are brought into the open.<br />The idea of the &quot;hat&quot; has the advantage that it allows people to play with a new perspective. People who argue by criticism, for example, can remain mostly critical. But by putting on the red hat they can voice their emotions, or by putting on the yellow hat they can think about positive effects. Western thinking tends strongly to focus on &quot;black hat thinking,&quot; says de Bono: &quot;At a Western-style meeting the participants sit there with their points of view and in many cases the conclusion they wish to see agreed upon. The meeting then consists of arguing through these different points of view to see which survives the criticism and which attracts the most adherents.&quot; De Bono wants to get away from this judgmental, confrontational style towards a more open, positive, creative and playful way of discussing.<br />De Bono's model tries to make discussions more rational. It acknowledges the importance of emotions in decision-making, and tries to separate them from the facts and from the positive or negative implications of the decision: &quot;once the emotions are made visible, then a thinker is more free of them&quot;. But making the discussion more transparent and structured is not enough. De Bono's model needs a &quot;facilitator&quot;, a person who puts a &quot;blue hat&quot; on, someone who organizes the discussion and leads it.<br />In the world of business, discussions are very often about power. The &quot;six thinking hats&quot; model requires a very enlightened, open-minded &quot;powerful&quot; person to work, or very assertive, courageous &quot;less powerful&quot; persons.<br />What are the problems with power? A person in power can abuse his &quot;blue hat&quot; position, for example. Or the culture of the company can be built on &quot;black hat&quot; critical thinking, where &quot;yellow hat&quot; positive thinkers tend to become scapegoats when things go wrong. &quot;Red hat&quot; revelations of the emotions behind one's point of view or &quot;green hat&quot; creative ideas are not forthcoming when power games are being played.

H. Blyth)<br />In this small book, Hiroaki Sato has put together more than 100 translations of the most famous haiku by the Japanese poet Matsuo Basho (1644-94). He has added a ten-page introduction to the work of Matsuo Basho and his most famous poem &quot;Old Pond&quot; which, in one of the most literal translations, reads as follows:<br />Fu-ru (old) i-ke (pond) ya, ka-wa-zu (frog) to-bi-ko-mu (jumping into) mi-zu (water) no o-to (sound) [transl. Fumiko Saisho]<br />&quot;One Hundred Frogs&quot; illustrates how many riches can be mined from a single poem, and how much fun it can be to try to capture the essence of a poem in another language. It also teaches a lesson in humility: It is just as impossible to translate poetry unchanged from one language to another as it is impossible to translate anything unchanged from &quot;reality&quot; into language. Ironically, a haiku tries just that. The art of writing haikus is strongly influenced by Zen Buddhism. The mind of a Zen master, it is said, is like a mirror: it reflects reality &quot;as it is&quot; and remains unmoved. A haiku, ideally, reflects reality like a mirror. This is an impossible task, of course. The haiku does not reflect reality, it reflects the poet's interpretation of reality. In this sense, the translations in this book are interpretations of interpretations of reality.<br />The translators approach the poem &quot;Old Pond&quot; with quite different attitudes. Some take a serious approach and, for example, try to retain the 5-7-5-syllables structure of the haiku: &quot;The old pond, yes, and / A frog is jumping into / The water, and splash.&quot; [G.S. Fraser], or &quot;The silent old pond / a mirror of ancient calm, / a frog-leaps-in splash&quot; [Dion O'Donnol]. The latter translation also tries to highlight the tension between silence/calm and sound/movement that is built into the poem. In this context, it is interesting to know that Zen Buddhism does not interpret silence and sound as opposites but as extreme expressions of a unique, indivisible reality - like the north pole and south pole of a magnetized stick: opposites, yet parts of one object. There is no sound without silence. There is no silence without sound. My favorite &quot;serious&quot; translation is the version by Cid Corman, a contemporary American poet: &quot;old pond / frog leaping / splash&quot;. After thinking so much about how to translate the poem, this is a refreshingly simple solution. In my opinion, it comes closest to the Zen spirit of the poem. And &quot;splash&quot; appears to be the most reasonable way to solve the question of what is &quot;the water's sound&quot;?<br />Other translators take a more light-hearted look. Bernard Lionel Einbond translates: &quot;Antic pond - / frantic frog jumps in - / gigantic sound.&quot; Antic-frantic-gigantic is a quite amusing caricature of the seriousness of other translations. Then there is a sonnet version and a limerick version. The limerick goes: &quot;There once was a curious frog / who sat by a pond on a log / And to see what resulted, / In the pond catapulted / With a water-noise heard around the bog.&quot;<br />And others again are even more playful. One George M. Young, Jr., contributed what he claimed was a yellowed newspaper clipping from his file: &quot;MAFIA HIT MAN POET: NOTE FOUND PINNED TO LAPEL OF DROWNED VICTIM'S DOUBLE-BREASTED SUIT!!!  'Dere wasa dis frogg / Gone jumpa offa da logg / Now he inna bogg.' - Anonymous.&quot; It is one of my favorites because of its irreverence for the importance of Zen. An attitude, by the way, that is very much in the spirit of Zen.<br />The most playful translation of the poem, however, is the one that the reader can compose himself by flipping the pages of the book with his thumb: what emerges is the visual image of an ink-painted frog jumping into a pool. Without a sound. Ironic.Funny. Apt.. Funny. Apt.	2002-01-17

His name has even entered the Russian language in the term &quot;oblomovshchina&quot;, meaning backwardness, inertia. The unheroic hero Oblomov is also a very fine literary creation of a fully-fledged human being. He is a melancholy idealist, a dreamer whose temperament is such that he never begins to put his dreams into action. His tragedy is that he weighs the possible obstacles to his endeavors for such a long time that, finally, he never even starts to act.<br />Ivan Goncharov is at his best when he describes the mental processes of Oblomov that lead to his bumbling life. There is no better description of how the mind of a pessimistic person manipulates the perception of reality than in this book.<br />&quot;The Saint of Sloth&quot; is the title of a review written by the critic V.S. Pritchett for the New York Review of Books. It captures nicely the two main aspects of Oblomov's character. On the one hand, Oblomov is lazy, irresponsible, pessimistic, paralyzed, complacent, slothful; but on the other hand he is idealistic, true to himself, honest, child-like, innocent, saintly. He is ultimately a lovable human being. He does not lack wisdom, he lacks resolve.<br />As can be expected, Goncharov's book is not an action-packed thriller. On the first 50 or so pages, Oblomov barely manages to get out of his bed. A patient reader who keeps reading, however, is rewarded with a wonderfully realistic love story (including all the ups and downs), and many wise comments by the bachelor Goncharov on life, love, passion, duty and marriage.	2002-01-07

I was surprised to learn that Murakami pondered this question when writing Underground because he did not explicitly ask the &quot;Big Question&quot; in this collection of interviews. That is just as well. There is probably no general answer that fits every individual person. And Murakami, as most novelists, is less interested in the big picture than &quot;in the concrete, irreducible humanity of each individual&quot;.<br />What he found was that the degree of suffering inflicted by the Tokyo gas attack varied considerably from person to person. Not only because of the different degree of harm that a person suffered but also because of the different ways in which they responded to the lasting damage to the body and the spirit. I was surprised how well most of the people coped with what must have been a devastating experience for them. Their resilience was astonishing. But then again, Murakami gave a voice only to the victims who were willing to talk about their experience and face it. I was also surprised how few of the lives of the victims took a radically different course after they had almost been killed by poison gas. The lives of those who suffered severe physical harm were radically changed, of course, but only one of the interviewees voluntarily changed his life in a substantial way (he divorced his wife). It is amazing how strongly human beings prefer continuity rather than change. It is amazing, too, that so few pondered Murakami's question &quot;What does it mean to be alive?&quot; The most common response - and I think it is a very human response - was to try to forget the shock of the events and to go on &quot;living&quot; (I almost wrote &quot;to get back in the rut&quot;).<br />Reading Underground has other rewards, too. There is Murakami's warm, humane voice when he describes a young woman who cannot speak and is left partially immobilized from the impact of the gas. It is vintage Murakami, a bit sentimental, a bit fuzzy, a bit mystical, but heartfelt, perceptive and written with the novelist's eye for detail: &quot;I place four fingers in the palm of her tiny hand - practically the hand of a child in size - and her fingers slowly enfold them, as gently as the petals of a flower going to sleep. Soft, cushioning, girlish fingers, yet far stronger than I had anticipated. Soon they clamp tight over my hand in the way that a child sent on an errand grips that 'important item' she's not supposed to lose. There's a strong will at work here, clearly seeking some objective. Focused, but very likely not on me; she's after some 'other' beyond me. Yet that 'other' goes on a long journey and seems to find its way back to me. Please excuse this nebulous explanation, it is merely a fleeting impression.&quot;<br />Underground is also a very relevant book about Japan and the effects of the long-lasting recession in Japan on the psyche of the Japanese people. Part One of Underground consists of interviews with the &quot;victims&quot;, Part Two contains interviews with members of the Aum sect. It turns out that many sect members were highly intelligent people that &quot;did not fit in&quot;. They were &quot;nails that stuck out and got hammered down&quot;, as the Japanese adage goes. They yearned for simplicity and purity, spirituality and belief in a society that became complex and muddled, materialistic and did not contain any inherent meaning (well, modern, in a word). For the members of the sect, the subway system represented HELL (the &quot;Underground&quot;: complicated and confusing - just look at the map!), and their secluded life represented a utopian HEAVEN (&quot;The Place that was promised&quot;: simple and clear). Murakami's genius lies in showing that the Japanese people who populate these worlds are human beings, each one with strengths and weaknesses, each one a victim and a survivor at the same time, each of them trying to come to terms with the consequences of modernity in Japan.<br />Doktor Freud, you may likehim or not, answered the question in the title of this review in a memorable way: to be alive means to learn to work and love. If things go terribly wrong, you get what Murakami describes: People who &quot;work&quot; hurry to their offices as usual even while suffering from the physical symptoms of gas poisoning, and people who &quot;love&quot; deposit Sarin gas in subway trains at the behest of their revered spiritual leader. Murakami's book is, eventually, an invitation to think about what working and loving really means.him or not, answered the question in the title of this review in a memorable way: to be alive means to learn to work and love.

Chang argues that the economic and political system of the People's Republic is teetering on the verge of collapse; in 5 to 10 years after China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) the whole house of cards will finally fall, and the Communist Party will be ousted from power in an eruption of violence. In Chang's opinion, neither the economic nor the political system can be reformed; the regime in Beijing will not win time during a slow process of reform (&quot;crossing the river by feeling the stones&quot;), but just make things worse as even more money is squandered by inefficient State Owned Enterprises and the corrupt Communist Party.<br />It is usually when people get overly optimistic and write books like &quot;Dow 36,000&quot; or &quot;China as No. 1: The New Superpower Takes Center Stage&quot; that things take a turn for the worse. Therefore, we should be glad that someone provides an antidote to the euphoria. After all, China and its 1.3 billion inhabitants produce an annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of just about the size of Italy's GDP. Italy has about 58 million inhabitants - and nobody considers Italy a superpower.<br />Gordon Chang's diagnosis is to the point. His prognosis, however, is debatable. After working for three years in Shanghai, I can only underline what Chang says about the sorry state of China's State Owned Enterprises and its banks. Doing business in China requires a good portion of sarcasm, and a lot of hope that despite the flaws in the system the whole state simply cannot collapse. In the words of a former executive of ING Bank: &quot;The bad news is that the Big Four [banks] are insolvent; the good news is that they're sovereign.&quot; Chang's prognosis that China will collapse after 5 years because the country will honour its commitments to the WTO and open its economy to international competition is not very convincing. China will find ways to curb competition where it sees fit. Japan and the EU have been successful in protecting their agricultural interests for decades, and foreign banks have not managed to get a real foothold in the big Japanese market to this very day. In my opinion, the Chinese will be even more inventive in finding means to keep foreign products and services out of their country. No, the WTO is not the nemesis of Communism in China. Will the Communist Party be overthrown in a violent revolution? I would not bet on it. The Communist regimes in Eastern Europe went with a whimper (not a bang). Which will it be in China? I don't know. I don't pretend to know.<br />&quot;The Coming Collapse of China&quot; is an angry book written by the son of a man who &quot;left China before the end of the Second World War and [the son] grew up hearing him say that Mao Zedong's regime would have to fall.&quot; The son returned to China to work as a lawyer in Shanghai.

The best parts of the book are the stories in which he lets others speak for themselves, or when he pokes fun at the authorities. Unfortunately, he comes across as self-opinionated too many times.

One of the themes that attracted me to the book was the question &quot;what role does religion play in the lives of the people in Malaysia and Indonesia, where Islam is a nation-building factor?&quot; The interesting thing is that Islam played a positive, reassuring role for many of the Malays and Indonesians interviewed by Naipaul. To convert to Islam was a way to gain respect and power in societies where the economies are dominated by a minority of former Chinese immigrants with business acumen and drive to &quot;make it&quot; superior to that of the local population. In Iran and Pakistan, however, Islam had a devastating influence, and the rise of fundamentalism has shattered the hopes of people for freedom, certainty, belongingness, and self-assurance. Islamic fundamentalists are essentially utopians with a totalitarian attitude: &quot;The cruelty of Islamic fundamentalism is that it allows only to one people - the Arabs, the original people of the Prophet - a past, and sacred places, pilgrimages and earth reverences. These sacred Arab places have to be the sacred places of all the converted people. Converted peoples have to strip themselves of their past; of converted peoples nothing is required but the purest faith (if such a thing can be arrived at), Islam, submission. It is the most uncompromising kind of imperialism.&quot;<br />One of the interesting ideas in this book is that great conversions take place when the pace of change overwhelms nations or cultures that &quot;have no means of understanding or retrieving their past&quot; because they lack the education, the language, and above all the freedom to reflect on it. Given the importance of understanding one's own past in order to gain an identity,  Naipaul sees Islamic fundamentalism as a dead-end road: it denies the converted peoples an open-minded education, a free language, and independent thoughts.<br />Naipaul tries to re-create the past and preserve the present. He writes grass-roots history in his interviews, and it is amazing how many details he weaves into his narrative. His obsession with facts and details is only a logical consequence of his belief in the importance of grasping reality (past and present), but it makes for difficult reading. I felt quite overwhelmed by Naipaul's elaborate descriptions of what he saw, and, to be honest, I thought less would sometimes have been more.<br />Overall, Beyond Belief was an interesting book for me because I try to get a better understanding of Malaysia and Indonesia; and it was a real eye-opener where Pakistan was concerned.

I love his irreverent wit and the mastery of his dialogue. He is a truly gifted observer and listener. Kureishi is an interesting author because he vacillates between the self-assurance of the satirical writer and the vulnerability that is part of being human. He used to rage against the very people by whom he wanted to be loved - as if they could never love him enough. In this sense, &quot;Intimacy&quot; is his most instructive and illuminating book.<br />Gabriel's Gift is, in some ways, a re-run of his first novel, &quot;The Buddha of Suburbia&quot;, this time with a happy end for the characters. Kureishi seems to have mellowed a lot since his earlier writings, but this change has not yet translated into a new style of writing or into new ideas. Gabriel's Gift is a book that gave me the sense of the author wanting to explore his roots as an artist in order to get somewhere, but he did not quite know where (which, of course, is not the hallmark of a great novel). But then again, Hanif Kureishi is always in search of himself. It is one of his strengths. Sometimes he delivers great writing along the way, at other times he does not.	2001-11-22

In fact, the cover of the British paperback edition (which, unfortunately, you can not see here) tells the whole story: on the top half is a photograph of a youthful Churchill flaunting an urchin's grin under a flamboyant top hat; on the bottom half is a photograph of Churchill in his sixties squinting against the sun while he inspected a battlefield during WW II.<br />Churchill was a complex personality, &quot;yet the essence of Churchill, which this book has attempted to explore and to celebrate, was his heightened vitality, the terrific immediacy of his existence. Life as it was ordinarily lived was too tame for him: he needed the stimulus of constant adventure.&quot;  He was grandiose, yet had self-deprecating charm; he could remark that although we are all worms he really believed himself to be a glow-worm.<br />Graced with a benign character and a sunny disposition, he nevertheless displayed an authoritarian bent (&quot;All I wanted was compliance with my wishes after reasonable discussion&quot;) and was driven by an unabashed, egotistical ambition. His disregard for hierarchies and naval tradition was legendary: &quot;Don't talk to me about naval tradition,&quot; was his famous reply, &quot;it is nothing but rum, sodomy, and the lash.&quot;<br />Churchill's greatest gift was his &quot;alchemical power with words: by means of fiery eloquence he could transmute the dross of disaster into the gold of triumph.&quot; Rhetoric was &quot;the most powerful weapon in his armoury and he took immense trouble with it, constantly practicing: 'Winston leads general conversation on the hearth rug addressing himself in the looking glass - a sympathetic and admiring audience.'&quot; His demagogic skills and self-advertising flair served Britain well at a time when the Nazi tanks seemed unstoppable: &quot;Churchill's well nigh miraculous achievement during the dire summer months of 1940 was to convert the nation to a mystical faith in its own providential destiny. ... Courage is as contagious as cowardice and Churchill infected everyone with his heedless fortitude.&quot;<br />Churchill was a sanguine choleric, if ever there was one. His &quot;scowling sulks made his moods of sunny cheerfulness all the brighter. His charm compensated for his rudeness; his loyalty redeemed his cruelty. His fundamental kindness of heart and generosity of spirit were never altogether obscured by perennial egotism and fleeting rages.&quot; Nobody could say of his intellectual arrogance that his brains went to his head: &quot;When the mood took him he bubbled with good humour. He never stood on his dignity. He had once amazed guests by getting down on all fours under the Chartwell dining-room table and shaking swimming-pool water out of his ears like a dog.&quot;<br />Churchill could be charming and demanding, as it suited him. After he had the US safely in his camp, he rejected the advice to approach America cautiously with the comment &quot;Oh! That is the way we talked to her while we were wooing her; now that she is in the harem, we talk to her quite differently.&quot; And, a rarity among politicians, he spoke a foreign language: &quot;'Je sweeze oun frair ehnay de la Trinnity'&quot; Churchill, the Elder Brother of Trinity House, was said to have told the French ambassador who supposedly congratulated him on having such distinguished relations.<br />Piers Brendon's intention was to write a &quot;vivid, balanced, complete but miniature portrait&quot; set against the background of Churchill's career, because &quot;the vast accumulation of knowledge about Churchill is in some ways an obstacle to understanding him. Comprehensiveness impedes comprehension [and] incidental vignettes can often reveal more than reams of pedantry - Churchill's telling Stalin that he was very fond of goldfish, for example, and the dictator hospitably suggesting that he should have some for breakfast.&quot;<br />I understand that some critics may get the impression that this biography is a light-weight when they read a tongue-in-cheek summary like &quot;Winston's fate was determined by his toy soldiers.&quot;  But that's a question of style, not substance.

In fact, it is 320 pages long. You have to read it twice to enjoy it fully.<br />The two diaries are written by a 55-year old professor and his wife who is 11 years his junior. To state the facts bluntly: He is oversexed and under-equipped; she is over-equipped and loathes him. In short, they are incompatible. They have been married for more than 20 years. As long as he sticks to his books and she to her traditional upbringing and old-fashioned morality the marriage works. Then, on New Year's Day, the husband starts to write in his diary about the sexual relations with his wife, knowing that she will read it. She, in turn, begins to write a diary in the knowledge that he will read it. A game of intricate manipulation begins during which he gains some momentary fulfillment of his desires and she finally finds a surprising solution to her marriage problem. It is an empty, ironic triumph, though. But I don't want to give away the plot.<br />The title of the novel alludes to the key to the husband's diary. A key is an instrument to open something that is locked. The husband intended the key to open up the heart of his wife to his needs. This is not what happens. His diary sets in motion another process. The key opens up something unexpected in his wife, ironically and tragically.<br />The novel can be read on several levels: as a mystery novel, a classic tragedy, an essay on marriage, a study in deception and self-deception, an exercise in the use of manipulation, a deliberation on sexual politics and obsession (even though this is the most un-erotic book about sex I have ever read), a story of female liberation, or a philosophical musing about the delusions of human beings.<br />It is absolutely a five-star performance. Please note the fine craftsmanship of Tanizaki. How he manipulates the reader, and how he structures the diary entries to reflect the balance of power between husband and wife (with the husband's fading influence and health, his diary entries fade, too). Please note, too, the fine moral balance that Tanizaki strikes. You may despise and pity his characters at the same time. Tanizaki completely refrains from letting his own ethical inclinations show in his characters. It is the process set in motion by the husband's diary that gives each of the two main characters what they desire.

US	51801617	RFCP2A4SE1OOR	0140185992	125402763	The Painted Veil (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)	Books	4	133	154	N	N	Of marriage and freedom	The kernel of this novel dates back to 1895 when Maugham was twenty years old and stayed in Florence to learn Italian. He came across a story in which a &quot;husband suspecting his wife of adultery and afraid on account of her family to put her to death, took her down to his castle in the Maremma the noxious vapours of which he was confident would do the trick; but she took so long to die that he grew impatient and had her thrown out of the window.&quot; It is around this core (which is not exactly the plot line of the novel, don't worry) that Maugham developed the story of Kitty Fane, a woman who is vain, superficial and in need of appreciation. It is a story that plays in Hong Kong and China in the 1920s. Maugham knew both places from his extensive travels in the South East but, characteristically for him, he does not spill much ink on descriptions of the landscape or the natives, which is a pity. He is much more interested in his fictitious characters.<br />As always, Maugham is a master of drawing characters who possess all the self-importance, weakness, and suffering that underlie human existence. His characterizations are so sardonically true that he was sued two times over the book by people in Hong Kong, and had to change the name of Hong Kong into Tching-Yen, and the name of one of the characters from Lane (innocent enough, one would think) to Fane.<br />I was wondering why this rather obscure novel by Maugham has received nothing but glowing five-star reviews by almost exclusively female readers. The reason is that this novel is about marriage and the restraints that marriage imposes upon passion. Also, it is a classic story of a woman's spiritual awakening. Two themes that appeal to female readers to such an extent that they tolerate Maugham's biting sarcasm and his rather unromantic view of life (he is quoted as saying that &quot;habits in writing as in life are only useful if they are broken as soon as they cease to be advantageous&quot;). If there is an author who is not touchy-feely, it is W. Somerset Maugham. Marriage, he soberly concludes, is a matter of convenience. Passion, on the other hand, is a matter of inconvenience: it lurks untamed  behind &quot;the painted veil which those who live call life&quot;. What is left? Faith?

Extreme Type A personalities are characterized by a free-floating hostility, aggressiveness, competitiveness, a constant sense of time-urgency, impatience and a constant striving for ill-defined goals. Just think of a choleric person you know. Extreme Type C personalities, on the other hand, suppress strong emotions, comply with the wishes of others, lack assertiveness, avoid conflict and behavior that might offend others, they obey conventional norms of behavior and maintain an appearance of niceness; stoicism and self-sacrifice appeal to them, their approach to life is outwardly calm and unemotional, and they have a tendency to feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. Richard Carlson has something to tell both of these types. His message is: become more sanguine, more forgiving and accepting of yourself, more laid-back, unaggressive, and easy-going; be the driver, not the driven; in short, become more like a typical Type B personality.<br />Richard Carlson's 100 suggestions how to slow down to the speed of life (incidentally, the title of another of his books) and how to focus on what is important are valuable reminders and great common-sense advice sprinkled with small bits of Eastern wisdom. Carlson does not push any theories or New Age stuff at the reader; he simply says, here are some things you might try and see if they work. If they do, practice them. Practice makes the master.<br />To give an example of a typical suggestion by Carlson: if you face an angry, aggressive person, imagine the person as a tiny infant and as a 100-year old adult; it will give you some needed perspective and compassion. That's true. When I underwent military training, the recommendation was that whenever the drill-sergeant yelled at me, I should picture him naked instead of resorting to some typical Type A or Type C behavior. It worked quite well. The yelling usually stopped with the comment &quot;get that smirk off your face&quot;.tead of resorting to some typical Type A or Type C behavior. It worked quite well. The yelling usually stopped with the comment &quot;get that smirk off your face&quot;.	2001-07-24

In my experience, this is the mode of existence that is predominant among expatriates in this country. What is quite unusual about Peter Hessler is the determination with which he tries to see China through Chinese eyes (quite unlike W. Somerset Maugham in &quot;On a Chinese Screen&quot;). He learns the language, he travels hard-seater, takes the slow-boats on the Yangtze, goes hiking among the rice fields, talks with the locals. He takes note of what he sees, and he takes notes. Lots of notes. They become the basis for the abundance of details about everyday life in the city and the college where he teaches.<br />The book is an impressive document of Hessler's love for the country, and at the same time, beneath the armor of his love, there is the anger and frustration he feels about not being accepted as the well-meaning, open-minded individual that he is (almost like a missionary whose good intentions are not valued). He works admirably hard at understanding the people, the culture, and the land, but the majority of Chinese do not change their idea of who he is, and very few change their behavior towards him. His frustration at being treated as a wai guo ren (the summary term for a person from a foreign country), as opposed to being treated as an individual, is palpable.<br />I am confident that this book will find readers years from now. For the time being it provides the most comprehensive picture of city life in the rural hinterland of a country in transition. Hessler has witnessed a very traditional China that is about to disappear in the process of the economic modernization, just like parts of the river town are about to be submerged in the lake created by the Three Gorges Dam. He is not sentimental about the old customs and traditions, but there is a whiff of nostalgia and a sense of loss in his book.<br />River Town is a memoir with an ambition to be more. It is not as original, crisp and witty as Salzman's memoir, and not as erudite as Winchester's travel book. Its ambition is to be poetic and realistic at the same time. Poetic in its depiction of the land, realistic when describing life in Fuling. This makes for a somewhat uneven mixture, and I think the book would have gained if Hessler had kept his talent for poetic evocation apart from his talent for reporting. He is very good at both, no doubt. My feeling was simply that the book would have been even better, albeit shorter, if he had concentrated on just one of his strengths.<br />River Town has the potential to become a classic China memoir. Peter Hessler is a gifted observer, and a person who has great empathy with the Chinese people. He is someone who tries to understand the country from the bottom up. Very admirable.rged in the lake created by the Three Gorges Dam.

The Rough Guides have always been a good compromise between the traditional Baedeker-style travel guides my parents used and the Lonely Planet guides from my backpacking days. The chunky Lonely Planets (the volume for China has the size and the weight of a solid brick) are still unrivalled when one wants to travel in a country with bad infrastructure and few tourist facilities; but for someone who travels light and wants to visit Singapore, the Mini Rough Guide to Singapore is a good choice.<br />It is a travel guide that fits easily into a pocket but has all the information one would expect: detailed coverage of the major sights, reviews of the best places to stay, eat and drink, a brief introduction to the history of Singapore, and nine useful color maps (including one for the subway system that came in handy). One of the highlights of the guide is a six-page section with short reviews of books for further reading. It includes not only travel accounts and history books but also works of literature that touch on Singapore, among them works by Anthony Burgess, Joseph Conrad, W. Somerset Maugham, and Paul Theroux (Mark Lewis, the author of the guide, spent a year teaching English in Singapore after graduating from university during which time he regularly contributed book reviews to the Singapore Straits Times).<br />The book is very readable, well organized, chock full of useful information for the visitor, and very &quot;user-friendly&quot;. It would qualify for five stars were it not for two (minor) complaints: One is that travelling mostly on a limited time budget, I have always liked travel guides with a couple of suggestions for day tours around town (none here, unfortunately). Secondly, I feel that a squeaky clean, efficient and hyper-controlled city like Singapore really asks for more irreverence and jokes than Mark Lewis allowed himself in his book. This is a matter of temperament, of course. Or maybe the editors of the Rough Guides series thought that a travel guide is not the right place to really indulge in the joys of oddities and ironies.vel guide is not the right place to really indulge in the joys of oddities and ironies.	2001-05-31

Like Caesar, he uses simple, straightforward language, and the language reflects the character of the man who helped lead 10,000 Greek mercenaries through hostile territory: a man of clear values, determination, ambition, and a strong sense of honor. With Tacitus he shares an interest in odd details and in strange customs of foreign people: &quot;a four days' march of sixty miles took him to the river Chalus, which was a hundred feet in breadth and full of large tame fish which the Syrians regarded as gods and would not allow anyone to harm them. (They think the same way about pigeons.)&quot;.<br />Xenophon's story has an immediacy and clarity that is truly amazing given the fact that he wrote it down 30 years after the events took place, and that we read it today, almost 2,400 years later. The Italian writer Italo Calvino captured the vivid yet factual tone of the Anabasis very nicely when he remarked that reading the book today &quot;is the nearest thing to watching an old war documentary which is repeated every so often on television or on video.&quot; (Calvino's essay can be found in his collection of essays &quot;Why Read the Classics?&quot;) Although the story is a never-ending succession of visual details and action, it is never boring. Xenophon writes succinctly, sprinkles small anecdotes, portraits of soldiers, speeches, and interesting details over the text, and peppers the story with exotic details.<br />Certain passages of the Anabasis reminded me of Hemingway's &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot;. Especially in the way both authors employ visual images and celebrate the qualities of food.

As it befits the writer who does not want to hit his readers on the head with a sermon, his morality is implicit in the style in which he writes, and in the tone of his story. Xenophon is not a sufferer, nor is he a stoic. He is an officer, a professional soldier. Xenophon's morality is that of a man of action who decides on right and wrong by looking at what he needs to do in order to master a given situation: &quot;what we have to do is to surmount our difficulties like brave men, not to give in, but to try, if we can, to win honour and safety by victory.&quot; Italo Calvino sensed in this attitude a precursor to the modern ethic of perfect technical efficiency, but in my opinion, Xenophon's ethics are more informed by a sense of commitment to the men he commands and the gods he respects. Xenophon strives to do his job well in order to generate discipline, solidarity and trust among his men, which is necessary not only for surviving the hardships of the journey but also for keeping one's dignity.

The year 1963 was a watershed for Kenzaburo Oe. In 1963, his son was born with a lesion of the skull through which brain tissue protruded. Unable to decide if he should allow the child to die or agree to an operation which would leave his son permanently brain-damaged, Mr. Oe went on a reporting assignment to Hiroshima that resulted in &quot;a decisive turnabout&quot; of his life which, he says, &quot;eschewing all religious connotations, I would still call a conversion&quot;.<br />The central figure of the essays is Dr. Fumio Shigeta, a medical doctor who was in Hiroshima on the day the A-bomb was dropped. He happened to arrive in the city to take up a new post just a week before the day of the bombing. It is through Dr. Shigeta that Oe learns how the bomb victims become social outcasts, have difficulties finding marital partners, get divorced because they cannot have children, hide in shame in the back-rooms of their houses for years, and commit suicide or go insane upon learning that they are diagnosed as having &quot;an A-bomb disease&quot;. In the midst of this pain and suffering, Dr. Shigeta patiently applies his medical skills to help the victims. He ignores the stigma placed on the victims by Japanese society, and for him there is no taboo on issues like the genetic effects of the radiation.<br />Dr. Shigeta is the &quot;authentic man&quot; for Oe, a person who is &quot;humanist in the truest sense &iexcl;V neither too wildly desperate nor too vainly hopeful&quot;. A man of modesty, patience and perseverance, Dr. Shigeta appears to be the real-life counterpart of the fictional Docteur Rieux of Albert Camus's novel The Plague: &quot;When Hiroshima was attacked by radiation - the plague of the modern age - the city was not specifically closed off. Since that day . . . Dr. Shigeta took upon himself the misery of Hiroshima, and has continued to do so for twenty years.&quot;<br />More than anything he saw in Hiroshima, it must have been the example of Dr. Shigeta that made Oe realize that there was just one answer to his own personal question whether his son should be operated to live brain-damaged thereafter or be left to die. If Dr. Shigeta could bear the suffering of thousands of strangers and dedicate his life to relieving their pain, then he could bear the suffering of raising a brain-damaged son. I believe it was this realization that made Oe wake up and face his own suffering: &quot;I think it was in Hiroshima that I got my first concrete insight into human authenticity.&quot;<br />While the Hiroshima Notes are the central document of Oe's humanism, they also provide a uniquely Japanese view of the Hiroshima bombing. Oe examines the feelings of shame and humiliation in the victims, and the attempts of the people of Hiroshima to forget what he calls the &quot;holocaust of the A-bomb&quot;.  His tone is very restrained and unemotional, devoid of moralizing and anger. Any sensationalism is missing from Oe's writing. He does not accuse or explain, he simply reflects. At times, though, he gets tangled in his reflections. The most embarrassing example is his argument that the A-bomb would never have been dropped on Leopoldville in the Congo because the American decision makers wanted to drop the bomb only on a people with the &quot;human strength to cope with the hell that would follow.&quot;  This racist, muddled thesis is an absolute exception, however. A small stain on Oe's essays which shows that even a Nobel Prize winner with a conscience will get caught up in prejudices from time to time.<br />I recommend these essays to anyone who has read Kenzaburo Oe's &quot;A Personal Matter&quot; (the fictional account of the decision the author had to make with regard to his son), and to anyone who ever had to answer the question &quot;why should I rather follow one course of action instead of another when both options involve me suffering?&quot;instead of another when both options involve me suffering?&quot;	2001-04-25

Looking at the life of Mozart, he asked what influence did the society in which Mozart grew up have on his development as an artist. Elias did not try to explain the nature of genius in terms of sociology, as the subtitle of the US translation implies. Rather, he tried to put Mozart's genius in perspective. The German title of the book made this quite clear: &quot;Mozart. Zur Soziologie eines Genies&quot;, which translates roughly as &quot;Mozart: Sociological aspects of a genius&quot;. The charm of the book really lies in the fact that Elias did not try to explain away the mystery of genius.<br />As a small extra for anyone who has ever wondered why so many important composers came from German speaking countries (Bach, Haendel, Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms, Schumann, etc.), whereas France and England produced few composers of the same stature during this period, Elias's essay has a neat, little theory which provides some answers. It also warms the hearts of economists, by the way.	2001-03-23

For example, he omits the Duino Elegies because, among other things, he is not convinced they belong to Rilke's best work: \\"There's something about them that is admirable but not likeable.\\"<br /><br />Bly has a good sense for the troubled life of Rilke and the inner strength that enabled Rilke to produce his art (a situation not unlike that of Hermann Hesse, whose poems Rilke once classified as being \\"on the verge of art\\"). Despite Rilke's neuroticism, his rootlessness, and his difficult relationships, for Bly, Rilke \\"stands for toughness, freedom from self-pity, ability to work, whatever one's life situation.\\"<br /><br />Bly states that he wants to be true to the sound of the poems, but his translations are quite matter-of-fact and lose a lot of the lyrical qualities of the German original. If you are looking for a translation that captures the spirit and sound of Rilke's poetry better than Bly's efforts, try Stephen Mitchell's The Selected Poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke (also available in this fine electronic store).<br /><br />To give you an idea of the difference in quality, let me compare the translations of the first stanza of the first of the Sonnets to Orpheus. The original in German is: Da stieg ein Baum. O reine Uebersteigung! / O Orpheus singt! O hoher Baum im Ohr! / Und alles schweigt. Doch selbst in der Verschweigung / ging neuer Anfang, Wink und Wandlung vor.<br /><br />Bly translates: A tree rising. What a pure growing! / Orpheus is singing! A tree inside the ear! / Silence, silence. Yet new buildings, / signals, and changes went on in the silence. (nice try at the \\"s-s\\" sounds, but why does he drop the \\"tall\\" - a nice alliteration to \\"tree\\"? And isn't it a bit cruel to the English language to write \\"buildings ... went on in the silence\\"?)<br /><br />Mitchell translates: A tree ascended there. Oh pure transcendence! / Oh Orpheus sings! Oh tall tree in the ear! / And all things hushed. Yet even in that silence / a new beginning, beckoning, change appeared.<br /><br />To give you an idea of the genius of the second translation, consider the following: \\"stieg\\" means \\"rose\\", but \\"stieg auf\\" means \\"ascended\\"; \\"ging...vor\\" means \\"happened\\", but \\"ging...hervor\\" means \\"appeared\\". Mitchell probed the connotations of the German verbs, and pushed their meaning - within the limits of the German original - to achieve a more poignant, vibrating, powerful quality in the English translation. Also, his use of alliteration is much closer to the spirit of the German original. Unable to keep the alliteration of Oh-Ohr, he employs tall-tree and and-all. On a personal note, I very much admire the choice of the verb \\"hushed\\" with its \\"shshsh\\" sound as a translation for the most important noun in the first stanza: \\"Verschweigung\\" (a neologism built from \\"verschweigen\\" (to conceal, to be silent), and \\"Verzweigung\\" (branching)). The \\"shshsh\\" sound keeps the many \\"s\\" and \\"sch\\" sounds you can hear when you read the first stanza (in German) aloud, and it is just as evocative of the sound of wind in a tree as the German original. That is an amazing achievement.Oh Orpheus sings! Oh tall tree in the ear! / And all things hushed. Yet even in that silence / a new beginning, beckoning, change appeared.

This interpretation is oddly off-mark. \\"A Personal Matter\\" does not really examine these issues; it examines how a man avoids facing his own, quite different feelings. A sense of shame does pervade the novel, but it is an emotion that is felt most strongly by characters who think in a more conventionally Japanese way.<br />Bird, the main character of the novel, is a 27-year old man in a failing marriage. He teaches at a cram school and dreams of escaping to Africa. He is drifting through a life that has no meaning or direction (not that he bothers). The birth of his brain-damaged son forces him to face the question \\"what is the right thing to do for me?\\". He dodges the question as long as he can, plunging headlong into a drinking binge, a sexual affair, and eventually a scheme to have his son killed by a quack doctor. But the question does not go away. It is his very own personal matter. No one can help him. The question corners him (not surprisingly, several scenes of the novel prominently feature blind alleys), and finally he finds HIS answer. Or rather, the answer finds him - he did not consciously look for it.<br />More than anything that is impressive about this novel - the evocation of a stifling atmosphere, the restrained, matter-of-fact tone of the narrator, the stark realism, the depiction of the sense of shame and horror that the birth of a handicapped child evokes in the Japanese - more than all these things I admired how Oe managed to convey a sense of the unconscious humanity of the man Bird (who, after all, does not live up to any moral standards when he begins an affair while, at the same time, his wife is about to give birth in hospital).<br />The book has a very real background: In 1963, Oe's own son was born with a brain hernia. The doctors predicted that the boy would be severely retarded and gave him little chance of living any significant amount of time. Oe almost decided to abandon the boy. But before he did, he went to a memorial for those killed at Hiroshima, and there he realized that he could not take the easy way out. Today, the boy is as old as I am, and he leads a more or less independent life as an artist in Japan.chance of living any significant amount of time. Oe almost decided to abandon the boy.

One looks cross, the other one snarls. Their paws shine from the touch of thousands of hands. Many people hope that some of the lions' power (and some of the bank's wealth) will rub off on them. The two guards of good fortune even had names once. In the 19th century, the snarler was called Stephen, and the cross lion was called Stitt in honor of their resemblance to two senior managers at the bank's offices in Hong Kong.<br />This piece of trivia is part of the fun of reading Jan Morris's &quot;Hong Kong: Epilogue to an Empire&quot;. As the subtitle suggests, the main focus of the book is on the British influence in Hong Kong. This is particularly evident in the four chapters that deal with selected periods of the history of Hong Kong: (1) the 1840s when Hong Kong was founded on a barren island as the base for British drug trafficking into China, (2) the 1880s when the colony and the British Empire were at the pinnacle of their power, (3) the 1920s when Shanghai began to eclipse the city, and (4) the 1940s when Hong Kong was occupied by the Japanese and later became the refuge for Chinese (many of them entrepreneurs from Shanghai) who fled the Communist revolution in China. The historical chapters are well-researched, and Morris enjoys elaborating on the quirks of the British in Hong Kong. The historical chapters are embedded in five chapters that take a more anecdotal look at the social, cultural, administrative, and economic aspects of life in Hong Kong. The chapter on administration is aptly named &quot;Control Systems&quot;. Not surprisingly for Hong Kong, the most extensive and interesting chapter deals with business and the economy. &quot;Means of Support&quot; is a very understated title for this aspect of life in Hong Kong. It would be more fitting to call it &quot;Get rich quick&quot;. Jan Morris knows how to sprinkle delightful illustrations of Chinese industriousness and entrepreneurial talent into her tale. With a smirk she revels in the &quot;endless variety of ingenuity, given to the world by such splendid-sounding concerns as &quot;the Grand Dragon Universal Sales Company, the Ever-Rich Industrial Company, or the perhaps unfortunately named Flying Junk Industrial Company Ltd.&quot;<br />The book has only two shortcomings. One is the fact that most parts of the book have been written in 1987, and only minor revisions were added in 1997, just before Hong Kong became a Special Administrative Region of China. To understand today's Hong Kong, the epilogue to an empire ought to be appended by a prologue to an uncertain future. The other shortcoming is the effect of Ms. Morris's expatriate perspective on Hong Kong. Her point of view omits many aspects that shape the life of the Chinese who have always been the majority of the city's inhabitants. There is still some truth in William Somerset Maugham's observation in the 1920s: the vast majority of foreign residents has not the slightest notion what is happening among the Chinese masses. Yet, in defense of Ms. Morris I want to state that she writes about what she knows best - and that is a writer's job.<br />Currently Ms. Morris's book is the best work about the vibrant, greedy, contradictory, and ultimately inscrutable city of Hong Kong, a place where it seems that only the temporary is permanent (except for the constant, ubiquitous noise of jack-hammers maybe), nothing is rooted and everyone is trying to move on. There is no simple denominator for this city and its inhabitants.<br />Having lived in Hong Kong for half a year, I can recommend Jan Morris's book as an entertaining introduction to the history and character of this fascinating city. I have enjoyed her Western perspective and her sense of humor as evidenced in her illustration why the Hong Kong Chinese are opportunists of genius: &quot;When communal lavatories were first installed in Hong Kong,Chinese entrepreneurs took to sitting on them for so long that people were obliged to bribe them to come off.&quot;g, Chinese entrepreneurs took to sitting on them for so long that people were obliged to bribe them to come off.&quot;	2001-03-15

It turned out that the author may have read some books about evolutionary psychology and talked to scientists in the field, but in his book he does not discuss their findings and theses. On the contrary, The Emperor's Embrace is part of the backlash against evolutionary psychology - and it is not a convincing example of that kind of writing.<br />Masson, who received a Ph.D in Sanskrit from Harvard University and later trained as a Freudian psychologist in Toronto, starts from a laudable premise that reminds me of a bumper-sticker slogan used in motivational seminars: if you can conceive it, you can achieve it. In Masson's words: &quot;we cannot test what we fail to imagine&quot;. Very true. Scientists must come up with creative ideas before they can put them to the test. And testable they should be, as Niko Tinbergen, one of the founders of ethology (the study of animal behavior) stressed: &quot;because subjective phenomena cannot be observed objectively in animals, it is idle either to claim or to deny their existence&quot;.<br />Masson's favorite ideas which he presents in &quot;The Emperor's Embrace&quot; are: (1) animals may feel the same emotions as humans, (2) animals may be able to exercise conscious choice, (3) emotions may determine animal behavior to a larger extent than genetic disposition, (4) it makes sense to define what is &quot;natural&quot; for an animal species. He is very careful to stress that these ideas are just possibilities which science should not rule out (note the word &quot;may&quot;). To give a couple of examples from the text: (1) &quot;these are the emotions that humans would feel in such circumstances; I can see no good reason to deny them to penguins&quot;, (2) &quot;not every male lion kills cubs. Individual behavior certainly suggests, to me at least, individual choice&quot;, (3) &quot;tales of animals who form deep friendships across the species barrier ... remind us of the primacy of feelings, of the powerful forces mobilized by sorrow and love and compassion, a power that can even defy the very bedrock of evolutionary logic&quot;, (4) &quot;by and large, I think attempting to determine what is truly natural is a worthy goal. We can then always choose to alter our behavior once we know what is natural, whereas if we don't know, we will make false claims resulting in behavior that is much more difficult to change.&quot;<br />I personally think no scientist should attribute human emotions to animals because not only do I agree with Tinbergen, but also because as long as we cannot define what an &quot;emotion&quot; is in a human being we should not try in an animal. A similar argument applies to the problem of free will. Free will is a purely subjective category, a human &quot;user illusion&quot;, if you want. As long as an animal does not tell me that it thinks it has free will, I see no reason to assume it actually thinks it has free will. The primacy of emotions over genetic disposition is also an untestable thesis as long as we can not clearly separate the parts of the emotional structure of a human being which are determined either by genes or by learning (the &quot;nature or nurture&quot; debate). Finally, I think it is time to throw the word &quot;natural&quot; on the dump heap of scientific debate. There is no such thing as a &quot;natural&quot; behavior. Behavior results from the interaction of a body with its environment. The body is a very complex issue (ask biologists, chemists and psychologists) and the environment is, too (ask sociologists, anthropologists, economists, historians, etc.). It is simply not possible to determine what &quot;natural&quot; is and then base &quot;good&quot; behavior on that definition. By the way, the &quot;noble savage&quot; which results from that kind of thinking belongs to the 18th century - and there he should remain.<br/>If you like to see animals as human (they may not look like us, but they feel like us...), and if you need to convince yourself that it is &quot;natural&quot; to be a good father - another argument of the book - go ahead, read it. If you think animals should be treated on their own terms, and if you have no doubts about your abilities as a father - don't read it./>If you like to see animals as human (they may not look like us, but they feel like us...), and if you need to convince yourself that it is &quot;natural&quot; to be a good father - another argument of the book - go ahead, read it.

The letters which are collected here show why. Rilke, like Cezanne, was a man who was religious in an unconventional way. He was not interested in any particular concept of God, but in the process of discerning the divine in the sheer existence of things as they are: &quot;All talk is misunderstanding. Insight is just in work.&quot; What he admired most in Cezanne's work was his &quot;devout objectivity&quot;, the ability to let objects speak for themselves without the intellectual interference by the artist and without preconceived notions. Rilke felt that when Cezanne painted the mountain Sainte Victoire, for example, he wanted to show the essence of the mountain, the mountain pure and simple, nothing more, nothing less.<br />The German edition of the Letters on Cezanne contains an excellent afterword which quotes the philosopher Martin Heidegger who wrote, &quot;we come too late for the Gods, and too early for being,&quot; meaning we do not live in the safety of believing in the Gods any more, and we do not trust in simply being yet. Rilke was acutely aware of this state of suspension, and the collection of his letters on Cezanne gives us an idea of how Rilke as an artist intended to make sense of this life in suspension.	2001-01-16
US	51801617	R19YWO14GR7QYL	0195837851	317006935	On a Chinese screen (Oxford in Asia paperbacks)	Books	4	41	41	N	N	Notes of an Englishman in China	William Somerset Maugham was 45 years old when he went on a trip to China in the winter of 1919. Always an astute observer, he jotted down notes, elaborated them, and finally had them published as a book in London. Fortunately, this small volume is now available again as a Vintage Classics paperback in the UK (and in the reviewer's favorite Shanghai bookstore). &quot;On a Chinese Screen&quot; is an appropriate title for the book because it depicts mostly English people against the backdrop of China at the beginning of the century. In 58 short sketches, the longest of which fits on just nine printed pages, Maugham portrays English missionaries, officials, army officers, adventurers and company managers. Maugham gently mocks their narrow-mindedness and indifference towards the country in which they spend a major part of their lives. &quot;On the whole,&quot; he remarks, &quot;it made little difference to them in what capital they found themselves, for they did precisely the same things in Constantinople, Berne, Stockholm, and Peking . . . China bored them all, they did not want to speak of that; they only knew just so much about it as was necessary to their business.&quot; Their attitude towards the Chinese was one of &quot;mistrust and dislike tempered by optimism,&quot; and they did not bother to learn the language.<br />Whereas Maugham is agreeably malicious in his portraits of the English and their wives, he can get outright scathing and sarcastic when he describes the hypocrisy of protestant missionaries. The Catholics have a better standing with him, which explains why Graham Greene calls Maugham a writer of great dedication. Maugham has a healthy disregard of professedly religious people whose deeds do not live up to their words, no matter whether they are English missionaries who behave as if they were in the civil service or whether they are Chinese farmers who perform the rites &quot;like an old peasant woman in France does her day's housekeeping.&quot; Maugham's depiction of the Chinese countryside leaves no lasting impression, yet sometimes he creates images of sheer beauty: &quot;the yellow water in the setting sun was lovely with pale, soft tints, it was as smooth as glass.&quot; The focus of his observations are people. Maugham senses the human beings who peek out from behind the roles they play in the scheme of the British Empire. Though he appears to be detached from the hardships of the Chinese, one can feel the effort it takes him to stay aloof when he observes the coolies, the &quot;human beasts of burden&quot;, and remarks that their &quot;effort oppresses you. You are filled with a useless compassion.&quot; Maugham's most heart-wrenching piece is a story with the innocent title &quot;The Sights of the Town&quot; in which he tells of a so-called baby tower used by the peasants to drop unwanted babies to their deaths. Spanish nuns in the nearby town try to save at least some of the unwanted newborns by paying twenty cents for every one because, as they say, the peasants &quot;have often a long walk to come here and unless we give them something they won't take the trouble.&quot;<br />Maugham, as skeptic and acerbic as he can be, also has a great sense of humor, freshness of observation and unconventionality of comparison. Summing up his impression of an opium den, he writes it reminded him &quot;somewhat of the little intimate beerhouses in Berlin where the tired working man could go in the evening and spend an peaceful hour.&quot; Well, I would not compare opium so non-chalantly to beer but his tongue-in-cheek British snobbery is definitely enjoyable. As is his mockingly spiteful aside towards Americans whom he regards to be such extremely practical people &quot;that Harvard is instituting a chair to instruct grandmothers how to suck eggs.&quot; My favorite funny piece in the book is Maugham's explanation why democracy gets flushed down by the Western sense of cleanliness. In his words, &quot;it is a tragicthought that the first man who pulled the plug of a water-closet with that negligent gesture rang the knell of democracy.&quot; Just check it out. Even if he were not kidding, it would be a side-splitting theory.<br />Some of the things Maugham observed eighty years ago still apply. For example, &quot;one of the peculiarities of China is that your position excuses your idiosyncrasies.&quot; And you can still see people getting their heads shaved on the sidewalk by old barbers. However, I can not report that &quot;others have their ears cleaned, and some, a revolting spectacle, the inside of their eyelids scraped.&quot; In general, the life of the Chinese was as impenetrable to Maugham as were the Chinese houses with their monotonous expanse of wall broken only by solid closed doors. Only in the portraits of an old Chinese philosopher (who impotently dreams of the old and better China) and a young drama professor (who lacks any broader vision of China) we get a glimpse of the inner lives of the Chinese.<br />The back cover of the Vintage Classics paperback edition shows a photo of the middle-aged Maugham. Turning his head to the observer, he has a look of weary curiosity in his eyes and a tiny smile in the corners of his mouth - as if he wanted to say, &quot;that is how it is.

When I read this book (which was originally published in German in 1979) for the first time in the early eighties, it completely swept me off my feet. Here was an analysis that explained why I was in search of my 'true self', why I felt my achievements were 'empty', why I felt empathy for others and antipathy for myself. The idea proposed by Alice Miller, in a nutshell, was that there are children who are able to feel and ease the emotional insecurity of their mothers (the 'gift' of the title), thus gain her love but in the process deny their own desires. These children grow up to become helpers in various roles, including therapists - like Alice Miller herself. They develop sensors for the subconscious signals of the needs of others. The problem is, they subconsciously deny themselves the pursuit of their own needs, and consequently cannot become who they 'are'. Which makes them prone to the illnesses which, according to the Freudian theory, go with suppressed desires - depression and grandiosity (the latter being just a way of keeping depression at bay).<br /><br />Alice Miller's ideas are based on her experiences as a psychotherapist who practiced for 20 years, and her own self-analysis. Her reasoning draws on some basic Freudian ideas: if the subconscious is brought to consciousness, the illnesses caused by the suppression can eventually be contained; the life of a person is rooted in her childhood and childhood experiences shape who a person 'is'. In the last part of her book she adds a theory derived from her work experience: when children whose needs have been denied in their childhood grow up and have children of their own, they can 'get rid' of their pain by inflicting the pain on their own children. She calls it the vicious circle of disdain, and the handing down of destructive attitudes from one generation to the next like a chain reaction.<br /><br />How do I see 'The Drama of the Gifted Child' almost 20 years after reading it for the first time? I continue to be convinced that the general argument is true. Alice Miller captures very well the emotional consequences of denying one's own desires in the service of a person whose love is so overpoweringly important that it demands the sacrifice of one's 'true' self. Hermann Hesse's life and works provide her with excellent examples to illustrate this, by the way. On some cornerstones of her argument, however, I have my doubts now. Firstly, the idea of a 'true self', chiseled in stone if you so want, does not sit very well with me any more. Secondly, her thesis completely omits the role of fathers (quite un-Freudian, by the way), and what I saw as a refreshingly new point of view 20 years ago, looks like a major shortcoming to me now. Thirdly, having read up on some developmental psychology, I do not believe any longer that early experience inexorably shapes our lives. Finally, I think humans are so complex that there can not be a simple mechanism such as a handing down of certain attitudes: there are just too many exceptions from the rule.<br /><br />'The Drama of the Gifted Child' is a powerful book and it is worth reading even after 20 years. It is not a scientific book in the sense that it contains testable findings, it presents a practitioner's conclusions gained from personal experience.

This idea was so dear to his heart that he said the first thing he'd do if he were to rule a state was the rectification of words: &quot;Let the ruler be ruler, the minister minister, the father father, and the son son&quot;.<br />Mr. Roget surely did not think the influence of his work would go that far. But his thesaurus, available now in the second edition of &quot;Roget's 21st Century Thesaurus&quot;, is a very useful tool nevertheless. On over 950 pages it lists 20,000 words from ABACK (meaning &quot;taken unawares&quot;, which is what I was when I found this treasure in the Shanghai Foreign Languages Bookstore for the equivalent of just 3 US Dollars) to ZOOM (meaning &quot;move very quickly&quot;, which is absolutely not recommended when indulging in this book). As a decent thesaurus should do, the Roget gives you a 'meaning cluster' for every listed word. In addition, for every listed word there is a reference to the unique Concept Index at the end of the book. The Concept Index is an extension of the original idea of a thesaurus, which basically groups words according to idea. That is, the thesaurus leads you from a single word to a group of related synonyms. The Concept Index, on the other hand, shows you the semantic ocean in which the word floats. Or, to quote the editors: &quot;The Concept Index not only helps writers to organize their ideas but leads them from those very ideas to the words that can best express them.&quot; (remember: &quot;the rectification of words&quot;). How does that work? The Concept Index is grouped in ten categories. One of my favorites is called &quot;Fields of Human Activity&quot;. Under this category one finds the sub-category 'communicative', for example, which contains all the useful words for book reviews from 'abusive' to 'zany'.<br />If you love words, this is your book.

He definitely does not belong in that category. The cover of the English translation, published by the Foreign Languages Press Beijing,(not this edition) claims that his story, set in the China of 1911, reflects &quot;the sharp class contradictions and the peasant masses' demand for revolution&quot;. Nothing could be farther from the truth. There are no peasants in Lu Xun's story who demand a revolution. On the contrary, when revolution &quot;arrives&quot; in the towns, it is the officials of the crumbling Ming Dynasty in the village who try to jump on the new train first. The peasants are dumbfounded, but essentially, they do not care. Ah Q is a day laborer who lives on the odd jobs he gets from time to time in his small village. He is an optimistic, naive peasant inclined to turn his daily humiliations into imaginary &quot;victories&quot;  When he commits the mistake of confessing his love to a lowly female employee in the household of a wealthy official by saying &quot;sleep with me&quot;, he is ostracised by the whole village and forced to steal in order to survive. Finally, he leaves the village. He returns as a man with money, and suddenly gains the respect of the villagers and the local officials. Later, however, he commits another mistake. He tells that the gained the money by selling stolen goods. In the end, he is executed because the officials decide that he has robbed the house of an official.<br />Lu Xun tells the story in a very detached manner, never interfering with comments of his own. He is very sarcastic: the final chapter which tells of the execution of Ah Q is titled &quot;The Grand Finale&quot;. Ah Q is depicted as a likeable fool, stumbling through life and thrown about by chance events and his own clumsiness. The world of the village is one of pettiness, slander, envy, opportunistic cowardness, intellectual tedium, and everyday muddling through.  The revolution never has any meaning to the village, other than an interference of the balance of power, an external event to which the poor and the less poor have to adapt in order to survive. Ah Q seems to me to be a symbol for China in the early years of the 20th century: a naive peasant who dreams of great things but finally stumbles helplessly to a bitter end.<br />The cover text of the Chinese edition concludes that it &quot;was the author's sincere hope that the broad masses of peasants, victims of feudal oppression and imperialist aggression, might be aroused and rise in resistance against them.&quot; My own overall impression of the atmosphere in Ah Q's village is one of stifling inertia where everyone was caught in a net of inhibiting relationships and only looked for his own (and his family's) improvement in social status.

The two volumes of the original edition - one in red, the other in green - were an essential must-have accessory of Japanese teenage girls. They took whichever volume fitted best with their dresses along to school. The appeal to female readership is no accident. \\"Norwegian Wood\\" is essentially a love story where a young undergraduate college student, the narrator of the novel, has to choose between two girls. Both girls are scarred, though in different degrees, by tragic events, and both experience the emotional helter-skelter of adolescence. They feel confused, sad, lost, alienated, helpless, bored, angry, empty, out-of synch, and most of all, they are trying to make sense of it all.<br />What makes this novel special is the compassionate distance of Toru Watanabe, the narrator. Murakami has a unique talent of depicting emotions in a restrained manner which brings out the humane core in the often odd and unusual behavior of his characters. And he does not intrude upon the \\"world\\" of his protagonist: implausible and invented as it is, the story appears realistic and coherent. Murakami, unlike other Japanese authors, likes to include Western culture in his works. One example of this is his use of Western novels in the construction of \\"Norwegian Wood\\". Toru Watanabe, the narrator, is modeled in many ways on Jerome D. Salinger's \\"Catcher in the Rye\\", his college friend Nagasawa resembles the \\"Great Gatsby\\", and part of the novel is set in a sanatorium which hints at Thomas Mann's \\"Magic Mountain\\".<br />If you want to get a feel of the original edition, you may want to buy the paperback version published in Great Britain from amazon.co.uk which comes in two small volumes (red/green) in a box.

Changsha has the reputation that \\"there is nothing to do, nothing to buy, the people have no manners, the food is terrible and their dialect sounds awful\\" - so the book might have become very different from what it is: insightful, very funny, and full of respect for the often strange customs of traditional Chinese culture. In the best manner of innocents abroad, Mark Salzman knows how to make fun of his blunders in a very charming way. He conveys his sense of wonder beautifully, and does not pass judgment on anything he witnesses. Unlike many other authors who write about China, he is able to appreciate traditional Chinese forms of expression and self-mastery like martial arts (wushu) and calligraphy on their own terms. In his anecdotes he catches the essence of these arts: dedication, commitment, respect. \\"No matter what the quality of brush or paper,\\" explains his calligraphy teacher, \\"one should always treat them as if they were priceless.\\"<br />What Mark Salzman wrote about China some 15 years ago is not dated in many ways. Strange ideas are still being trumpeted as truths, and bureaucrats still like to harass foreigners (although humiliating unwitting foreigners is not \\"something of a popular sport in China\\" anymore; today it may even happen that a young female police officer at a police station first lectures you for half an hour on a minor transgression, but asks you out for a date right after she is finished).<br />Mark Salzman has a wonderful, gentle humor, and an admirable open-mindedness. He combines both to focus not on the ignorance of the people he meets, but on the insight which even ignorance can produce. There is no doubt that one little Chinese boy has no idea about the real Hong Kong, but being asked what he knew about this city, he answers \\"It's a big department store, isn't it?\\" Finally, let me say that I have never heard or read of a more charming and polite way of telling a Westerner that he has a big nose than in Mark Salzman's gem of a book: \\"You have a very three-dimensional face.\\"about this city, he answers \\"It's a big department store, isn't it?\\" Finally, let me say that I have never heard or read of a more charming and polite way of telling a Westerner that he has a big nose than in Mark Salzman's gem of a book: \\"You have a very three-dimensional face.\\"	2000-10-27

Some of his favorite subjects are the purposeless, non-progressive nature of evolution (and why we like to deny this fact), the unconscious reflection of social and political ideas in scientific theories, the explanatory power of Darwin's theory, and the peculiar details of the history of science (for example, why Darwin was NOT the naturalist on board of the H.M.S. Beagle). Gould's essays are always full of surprising details, telling anecdotes and witty asides. He would have made an excellent Enlightenment philosopher because he reminds his readers again and again that reason and the scientific method are powerful instruments - if one is aware of their limitations (for example, the &quot;anthropocentric bias&quot;, the belief in human &quot;specialness&quot;). Throughout, Gould highlights the human side of science, and the human creativity involved. For him, science is not a &quot;mechanical collection of facts and induction of theories, but a complex process involving intuition, bias, and insight from other fields&quot;. Gould has a gentle humor, and an infectious enthusiasm; he likes to play with words (one essay is titled &quot;Is the Cambrian Explosion a Sigmoid Fraud?&quot;), asks interesting questions, never shys away from the odd detail, and takes particular pleasure in theories that contradict common sense. Reading Gould, I get the feeling that his way of arguing could well have been the way Socrates once talked to anyone you cared to listen: ask before you accept anything as &quot;fact&quot;, and be aware of your limits. Or to put it in Gould's words: &quot;I will rejoice in the multifariousness of nature and leave the chimera of certainty to politicians and preachers&quot;.and preachers&quot;.	2000-10-12

Nothing is as  fascinating as love, unfortunately.&quot;<br />There is a bitter irony in the  choice of &quot;intimacy&quot; as the title of this short novel. Intimacy  is what love inevitably brings about, and intimacy is what ultimately  stifles love for Jay, the narrator of Kureishi's third novel. It has been  called a hate letter to the author's former partner and mother of twins,  and drew fierce criticism for its self-centered brooding and lack of  self-awareness. True, it is not a work which grows from the kind of wisdom  that looks for the golden mean. But it is a very entertaining and, despite  its serious subject, surprisingly funny book about the one human passion  that defies all common sense: romantic love. In Jay's definition, love is  nourished by beauty, mystery, pleasure, novelty - in one word:  impermanence. Jay defends his idea of the ideal love against the morality  of the majority, and it takes a sense of humor and some tolerance on the  part of the reader to enjoy his way of thinking. In his very own peculiar  way, Jay is in pursuit of happiness. He wants to live life to the fullest,  but always remains on the verge of failure because his ideal of love is so  elusive.	2000-09-12

As  with most newspaper photographs of the time, there is a stagy,  posed-feeling to it (to take an out-of-context quote from the book). The  story is told from the perspective of Christopher Banks, a detective and  one of the orphans of the title. Banks became orphaned as a boy when his  parents were kidnapped in Shanghai around 1910.  He was shipped to England,  grew up there and became a detective in the 1930s. In 1937 he travels to  Shanghai and in the midst of the fighting between the Nationalists, the  Communists and the Japanese army he tries to uncover the secret behind the  disappearance of his parents.<br />The key to the book is the narrator. He is  not what he pretends to be, and what one assumes a detective to be:  rational, controlled, and objective. Christopher Banks is the very  opposite, yet he has found ways to conceal this - even from himself. His  outside may be sturdy, but his inside is fragile. Like the doors in his  childhood friend's house in Shanghai he has two sides: on the outer side  oak-paneled with shining brass knobs; on the inner side, delicate paper  with lacquer inlays.<br />While reading the book for the first time, one is  deceived by the dull shine of Banks' story and his labyrinthine world of  memories strangely lacking in emotion and coherence. Towards the end, in  the bizarre rendering of Banks' journey through war-torn Shanghai it  becomes increasingly clear just how much the novel is filled with the  \\"words of a confused child, trying hard not to display his upset\\".<br />\\"When  We Were Orphans\\" is a compelling read as a psychological study and as an  experiment in unreliable narration. The novel is almost a case study about  how the pain of loss is denied and covered up but persists beneath the  rather formal, almost blandly pleasant lines of Banks' story. As such it is  a  masterpiece of craftsmanship.most blandly pleasant lines of Banks' story. As such it is  a  masterpiece of craftsmanship.	2000-09-12

Embedded in  the story of his journey is the history of China since the late 18th  century: the arrival of the European powers, the Opium Wars, the Japanese  invasion, the Civil War, and the years of Communist rule which culminated  in the construction of a new Great Wall - the Three Gorges Dam that will  irrevocably change the Yangtze river.<br />Winchester observes, describes, and  rarely comments. He has an eye for the right details and the odd anecdote,  and he is so well-read that he never loses the big picture. He loves the  subject of his narration, and his enthusiasm is palpable on every page -  especially when he tells the stories of the English sailors who explored  the Yangtze River. His non-judgmental, open-minded way of writing makes the  book a pleasure to read.<br />For people initiated to the ways of China there  are many moments of recognition. Take the seemingly bizarre behavior of  some village officials, for example, who claim they cannot show Winchester  an ingenious invention on which they have spent their time because the key  to the room where it is kept is lost. Of course, there is no invention at  all, they have been idly wasting their time, drinking tea and smoking  cigarettes in their offices but what a loss of face it would be to admit  it!<br />Among travel books about China, &quot;The River at the Center of the  World&quot; has no equal. It is simply the best, and most entertaining,  introduction to China at the beginning of the 21st century.	2000-08-07

Going to Great Britain was a dream she  pursued with determination against the wishes of the family of her husband,  who had departed for Great Britain before her, and against the traditional  role which her native culture saw fit for women. Adah is not so much  disappointed with what she finds in Great Britain (surprisingly, since she  expected to find the &quot;kingdom of heaven&quot; there) but with the lack  of change in her husband who neither can nor wants to question his  traditional ways. On top of that he is lazy, bad tempered, and spoilt. He  does not care for his wife, he cares for the money she brings home so that  he can slouch on the couch and otherwise follow his whims.<br />Adah brings an  interesting aspect to racism: You are only a victim if you think of  yourself as a victim. For her part, she never accepts that she is regarded  as a &quot;second class citizen&quot; because she is black or because she  is a woman. Her husband, on the other hand, wants to fit in and actually  tries to conform to the society's racist view of him. He has lost his sense  of dignity, but Adah has not. She draws great strength from her  determination to lead a better life, to get an education, to give a better  life to her children, and to become a writer.<br />The style in which the  novel is narrated is very plain and simple, just in line with Adah's  sraightforward, practically minded character. It is quite unemotional and  creates a certain distance between Adah and the reader. Beneath Adah's  tough surface, however, one can sense the pain she feels at not being loved  by her husband &quot;for what she was and not just because she could work  and hand over her money like a docile child.&quot;<br />&quot;Second Class  Citizen&quot; is an impressive portrait of human dignity under pressure,  and of the the sheer will of an individual to persist and to be what she  knows she can be.nd of the the sheer will of an individual to persist and to be what she  knows she can be.	2000-07-18

It was. Shanghai has joined the rest of the hurried world after all.<br />In &quot;Faster&quot;  James Gleick gives us a catalogue of the most visible symptoms of the  &quot;acceleration of just about everything&quot; and of our reaction to  this phenomenon. His conclusion is that our (Western) society and age  suffer from what he calls &quot;hurry sickness&quot;, and generally idolize  Type A personalities: pushy, competitive, impatient people.

Gleick's scope is wide. He is  talking about &quot;just about everything&quot; getting faster. I was  dazzled - but also distracted, even bored at times.<br />In the first and the  last chapter Gleick touches on the question of how people experience time.  This is where things got interesting for me, and where Gleick gave a nice  example why it appears as if time moves faster the older people  become.<br />If you do not believe that we live in an accelerated world, try  some very original and witty deceleration: Push the SLOW MOTION button and  read Nicholson Baker's &quot;The Mezzanine&quot; or &quot;The Fermata&quot;  by the same author. Try &quot;The Mezzanine&quot; first - you might get the  wrong impression about Baker's qualities as a writer from the latter work  (I have not really decided yet whether &quot;The Fermata&quot; is  pornography, or not...).	2000-07-17

The characters are  flat and undeveloped, and the turn of events strictly follows the logic of  suspense and surprise. &quot;Saved in the last second&quot; is one of the  favorite artistic devices of the author. Secondly: I have read the book in  one go. It takes just a few hours, and the book is almost impossible to put  down. That is an achievement in itself. One star. Thirdly: Crichton is  fascinated by technology for its own sake. He is not very interested in the  way it impacts people's feelings, their view of the world, their values, or  their social relations. However, he brings to life the ideas of quantum  theory and the technology behind medieval warfare. One more star. Finally:  The book proves one particular point in a clever way. As one of the  characters in the book claims, the driving force behind the business of  &quot;time tourism&quot; is the realization that &quot;in other centuries,  human beings wanted to be saved, or improved, or freed, or educated. But in  our century, they want to be entertained ... This is the intellectual  reality of Western Society at the end of the century.&quot; Of course, I  said, this is not true for me. Pure entertainment - not me! But let's face  it: I have spent hours reading a book only because of its entertainment  value, and I have been easily tricked into proving Mr. Crichton's point. I  am impressed. Third star.	2000-07-10

His great inspiring idea was that we can come to know the right way to live if we use our reason properly, and inquire in an open-minded, nondogmatic  way.<br />In this spirit, &quot;Ten Theories of Human Nature&quot; does not  restrict its inquiry to five major thinkers of the Western Tradition  (Plato, Kant, Marx, Freud and Sartre), but includes three ancient religious  traditions (Confucianism, Hinduism, and Christianity) as well as two  scientific thinkers (Skinner and Lorenz).<br />Each of the ten theories is  examined under four aspects:<br />(1) what is its theory about the  world?<br />(2) what is its theory of the nature of human beings?<br />(3) what  is its diagnosis of what is wrong with us?<br />(4) how can we put it  right?<br />The result is a concise, well-balanced textbook with useful  suggestions for further reading. It shows how the focus of each theory on  different aspects of human existence branches out into elaborate  (sometimes, arcane) systems of thought. It also illustrates how the  dominance of very comprehensive theories, especially religious ones, is  replaced in time by more scientific, narrow theories which increase our  knowledge about human behavior in very particular, small aspects but tend  to lose sight of larger, &quot;non-scientific&quot; issues.<br />While the  authors claim at the beginning of their book to present &quot;rival&quot;  theories, the book is actually open-minded about the contributions of each  theory to the understanding of the human condition: they are adding up,  rather than canceling out.<br />Meeting the ideas of Sartre, Skinner and  Lorenz in the context of the book was an interesting experience for me.  Surprisingly, I found that Sartre's ideas about freedom and choice could  well form the philosophical basis of the main-stream American self-help  book - a thought that any self-respecting French intellectual would  definitely hate.	2000-04-17

It speaks in plain language and tries to avoid mystical jargon. Ironically, it is also a story of self-perfection - ironically because Zen  Buddhism teaches the abandonment of the idea of a &quot;self&quot;.<br />There  are many ways one may go from this book: One of the main themes of Zen in  the Art of Archery is &quot;art becoming artless&quot;, which is also at  the core of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's bestselling study of creativity in  &quot;Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience&quot;.<br />Someone who is  interested in the spiritual qualities that (sometimes) come with the  practice of martial arts might like to read &quot;Iron and Silk&quot; by  Mark Salzman - don't expect anything holy or warrior-like,  though.<br />Zen-Buddhism is covered in countless books. One of my favorites  is Alan Watts's &quot;The Spirit of Zen&quot;.

Chatwin had  originally intended to use these notebook entries for a book on nomads. He  gave up the project but the entries reveal the man and his quest.<br />In a  way, The Songlines is Chatwin's own songline: a track which tells of what  he found on his wanderings, and what he considered worth singing.	2000-03-27
