Her first 3 are the best I have ever read. Back to this one: I loved Ewan's sensual nature, and how both were very passionate. I enjoyed the story surrounding their love affair. Many men could learn how to make love by reading Hunter's books. She is the best I have read at describing the intimacy. She writes a good story surrounding the intimacy. You can count on her to write at a mature level. I did find that \\"Ewan\\" was not an attractive name, and did not fit this smoldering, sensual, man.	2005-07-16

I am finding that past good authors have fizzled out, and I have been searching for more good authors. To me a good author writes for the mature reader, and doesn't follow the traditional plot lines. This was my first book by Goodman. I found it to be excellent. I read the negative reviews and really have to wonder about those who wrote them??  As I was reading this book, I suspected that Bria was raped. I wondered how the author would handle it? She dealt with it straight on as reallity would have. It was obvious that Bria was very effected by the rape. Luke was a very giving and considerate man. When it came to Bria, he was mostly selfless. His love and gentleness gave her back her soul! The first love scene was extreemly moving and those that followed held their own. The intimacy was boldly written and very well done. Are there any men that make love the way Luke did? Men could learn a lot from reading this story. I liked how the story didn't follow convention, like a murder that was highly suspect but no one persued their suspicions. At the end, instead of the usual story line of the female lead being in danger, it was the male lead that was in danger. And, the ending surprize was very uplifting. I, also, loved the dialogue between Bria and Luke. It was at times short and to the point. I loved how they were honest with each other and their wasn't a lot of withholding or lying. This was a very good story and I hope the negative reviews won't stop anyone from reading it. I hope Goodman has produced more good stories because I will definitely buy more of them.	2004-10-28

I am very disappointed in Ms. Hunter. Her first 3 books &quot;By ....&quot; were the best I have read. I suggest reading those 3 books that start with &quot;By&quot; you will not be bored or disappointed. They are excellent stories and very sensual. This book was boring. The intimacy was well done as Hunter does these scenes, but, I didn't care nor was I moved. I hope she didn't have just those first good stories in her because her talent was evident in her first books. Don't bother to read this one. Come on Hunter, get back on track.	2004-03-21

This book was my 4th read by Ms Brockway. I grade them from B+ to A+ this one being an A. I was moved by these flawed characters. The plot was entertaining and different from the usual. I like how Avery was first to admit his love, etc. Usually its the female. Avery was shy and without a lot of experience, he was a real man with honor, tenderness, and strength. This was a story that was hard to put down. And Brockway never lets the reader down in the intimacy department. In general, this book is very much worth reading.	2004-03-06

The first book I read by this author was \\"Kiss of the Highlander\\" and it was a 5 star story. This book was my second one and gets 3 stars for the sizzling sex and the first 1/2 of the story. The last half of the story was boring and it took too long to achieve each event. This story could have been told in 275 pages instead of 369 and been much faster paced, which would have been better. I'll give this author credit for knowing how to write love/sex scenes and depict appreciation for both male and female bodies. And, her male heros are to die for.

I was disapointed after reading &quot;Educating Caroline&quot; which was a very good story. Now, I'm not sure I should read anymore of Ms. Cabot's books. I liked the two main charactors, but the almost constant revealing of their thoughts and thinking things out was oh so boring. When they were acturally together, it was good reading. I started skipping paragraphs frequently in order to get to the good parts of them being together. The intimacy was well done.	2003-01-31

But, I like a higher intellectual, mature story. I won't read anymore by Ms. MacGregor. Added note: She writes detailed intimacy scenes which I like, but without the maturity of the writing/story to go with the love scenes, they are unmoving.

I read these books for an escape like watching T.V.  I love an author that writes for a mature reader instead of the teenager. This is a story for mature people who can handle bold, sensual and erotic intimacy that results from an attraction, desire, and (initially)unspoken love between the main characters.

Sure it wasn't realistic for the times, but who cares, it was well written. You couldn't help but really like and care about Hollie and Charles.  The sexual tension between them was so well depicted and when they finally made love, WOW!  Ms. Needham writes for a mature reader (not a teenager), and I thank her for that. The communication between Hollie and Charles, the side characters, the side issues (such as he can't read and he has an illigetimate son that he learns to love) all show what a talented author Needham is.  This is the 4th book I have read of hers and I give them all 5 stars. I love the sensuality in her stories. I am a college graduate, career woman, and in my late fifties. You can trust me when I recommend an author. Needham is excellent!	2002-04-19

The first part started out very good and was promising, THEN, it became unexciting. The intimacy was well described but for some reason was boring after the second time. Maybe there wasn't enough chemistry depicted between Rosamunde and Aric and, therefore, the well described intimacy just wasn't moving to the reader.

The story line kept me reading. It kept me wanting to know what happened next and the results. This story was written with the realities of the times, ie, the way women were treated and used. The reality that things are not always nice like the rape and the evil, etc. The sex, even when it was rough, was good for them and that's what counts. I cared about Phillippe and Aelvina, I liked them, she was strong and he was stronger, I rooted for them. Their lives were not easy. This is the reality of those times. This was not a completely tender love story (but it became one towards the end). It wasn't all nice nice. It was a MATURE story with a love that evolves and is very moving. This is one of Ms. Rice's earlier books and is better than two of her later ones that I have read. If you are mature and want to read a very well written and mature love story, read this book.	2002-03-21

This was my first and last experience with Ms. Laurens. I felt her main characters didn't grab the reader and cause you to care about them. They had no depth to them. There was too much detail involved in the conversations with servants, etc. that was boring. The intimacy was described in detail but their behavior during each act was repetitious. The acts went on for many pages but during those pages nothing new was said or done that couldn't have been covered in two paragraphs. I found that I wanted to start skipping sentences. I have never felt that way in any other book I have read. Basically the intimacy was not moving. In my opinion it needs to be moving in order to have the reader care about the characters working their lives with each other out, discovering their love, etc. Read books by Madeline Hunter if you want to know how scenes of intimacy should be written. I have read many good authors that write a mature love story. Ms. Laurens doesn't live up to them.	2002-03-15

It could of been told in 340 pages. Jos was attractive and senual character. Julianna was supposed to be so strong and intelligent yet she didn't know that during the night she lost her virginity? Didn't she see the evidence? Pretty stupid! Did the author really think the reader wouldn't question this? Does she think we are as stupid and Julianna? Julianna, also, behaved quite silly in her resistence to marry Jos.  Jos was the only reason I gave this three stars.	2002-02-04

It lacked the fun and laughter of the first two book in the series. The laughs I had while reading the first two books were the best I've had.  This story was all seriousness, and the old ladies weren't that intertaining though they were lovable.

I didn't even finish this one because it was so bad/silly. There are some very good authors that I have been descovering lately, Madeline Hunter being one.

It was like the servants were main characters with a lot of focus on them, and they were supposed to be humorous. I found the focus on them to be repititious and boring. Story was good when it focused on Annaliza and Sin. At one point, Anna is raped. The author gives a detailed account of this rape, and then it is never addressed again. Strange!

I think the first one, &quot;The Wind Dancer&quot; was the best story, and &quot;Storm Winds&quot; second best, with this one as third best. I just have to make one comment, something I found very strange in this author's writing. In the last two books of this series, the intimacy between the two main characters contained NO kissing. The author did not speak of kissing during the lust/passion/love scenes. the kissing referred to is a kiss on the forehead, a kiss on the cheek. Why was kissing not included in this author's love scenes in these two books???  It was included in the first book. Very Strange!	2001-08-09

Started out holding my interest, but as the story progressed, I became quite tired and bored with Hunter's constant opinion of Sassy as a flirt, etc.  The level of writing became intellectually simple, a story more for the adolescent population.  It was a reminder of how women were, and are still to some extent, blamed for man's lust, desire, physical reaction, etc. Men, all of us, need to be more accountable for our behaviors and feelings and stop blaming things outside ourselves.

There was too much filler of boring conversation and discriptions. If Ms. Busbee would have left out the filler stuff, she would have had a good short story. Sometimes, the story you have to tell doesn't have to take 406 pages. Also, the passion was good but lacked in discription. Funny, when everything else was described in boring detail.

Ms Mason has written much better than this. The dialogue between the characters was adolescent. The heroine was judgemental and stupid in many ways, one was that she never asked what any ones' crimes were. She and Robin didn't have a decent or intelligent conversation until the end, yet they were in love with each other. The sex was great, but lets face it there has to be something else for true love to grow. I enjoy sex scenes, but even I got board with the frequency of it. The story itself had potential but the characters being so adolescent  in their dialogue took away from it. The two star rating I gave is for the potenial of the story. To bad the characters ruined it, especially Kate. Robin wasn't quite as bad.	2001-03-22

Although this was a nice and enjoyable story, I think Warlord was  much better (which was Kenric's, Guy's brother's story). Also, Kenric in this story didn't seem to carry the persona that he had in his story - Warlord.

He is everything you don't like, but oh so sensual, you can't help falling for him along with her. Their journey, with the gambling, the buildup to sexual intimacy, the rescue of her brother, the trial, the admission of love, the almost marriage, the final marriage, the supporting characters, was VERY INTERESTING,INTERTAINING, AND MOVING. I highly recommend reading this book. My only negative comment is I would have preferred a little more detailed discription of the intimacy. But don't let this stop you! read it!	2000-12-29

They were proud and brave, and they had flaws. There was sadness and there was fun (chuckles). And, there was love. Raymond and Juliana are to be remembered. Raymond's tender respect for Juliana was moving. There should be men like Raymond now days. I found this story/the Hero and Heroine to be touching, they touched my heart. My only criticism is I would have liked the intimacy to have been more detailed. This was my first Dodd book, I will read another.	2000-12-15

I did not care for the first person narrative. I think this is what took away from the story - not knowing the thoughts and feelings of the other characters especially Reeve. Even the intimacy was on the low key side. I read a book once that the first intimacy shared by the main characters took 14 pages. It was fantastic! Wish I could remember the authors name so that I could read more of her books.	2000-11-30

Enjoyable! McNaught is a depenable author, she has many excellent reads. I gave this one four stars instead of five because the sex is not as steamy as it is in other of McNaught's books that I have read.	2000-11-27

When Matt and Meredith were together it held my interest. I cared about them. I do believe that the author used too many words to tell this story and that is why I gave it 3 stars. The middle section of this story is too wordy and Long. I was anxious to get to the meat of the story. Also, I felt a lot of anger with Mer's father and found it rediculous that he could get away with his controling behavior. I just wanted to get to the happy ending and get this book over with. I didn't care for how the negative parts were so dragged out. Read Kingdom of Dreams, Whitney My Love, and Until You. These stories are fantastic!!!	2000-11-22

I congratulate Ms Johansen for daring to take  sexual intimacy beyond the two common positions. It was well written and beautiful because both found great pleasure in the experiences with each other.	2000-11-07

I loved how Deinwald put up with her physical assaults on him. The mud fight was great! When the news came as to who she really was I was laughing aloud. They both were straightforward in their dealings with each other. I enjoyed this because it's nice to not always have the misunderstanding that usually seperate lovers. I loved it when he was the one the king wanted her to marry and he was already married to her. Get on with it, read this book.	2000-11-03

I liked the different approach of Cyrene seeking to get rid of her virginity and what that did to her. The relationshipe between Cyrene and Rene and the mystery as to who he really was and his purpose kept me reading. The authors way of telling the love/sex scenes was very poetic which was touching and moving.  I highly recomend the reading of this book. It's one of the best I have read.	2000-10-27

The traveling back and forth between 100 years ago and present time became ridiculous and silly. Wasn't very grown up intertainment. There were a few interesting parts to the story but not enough to outway the silliness. I'm quite surprised by the good ratings given by other reviewers of this book. Did they read the same book??  If you want to read a good book by Deveraux  that deals with time travel read &quot;A Knight in Shining Armor&quot; and forget this one.	2000-10-24

But you would never know it from this book. I am a Coulter fan, and I was very disapointed in The Cove. the writing/story was more for the teenage group. I knew what was going to happen before it happened, there were no suprises. I found Sally's behavior to be frequently stupid. Who would continue to mouth off when they are being hit in the face and the ribs?? She did this frequently. I finished the book because I have this thing about leaving something unfinished, but, believe me I kept counting how many more pages to go. I'm hesitant to read anymore of Coulter's mysteries. However, she is very good with historic romances. I'll just stick with those.	2000-10-12

I experienced all emotions while reading it. Towards the end I felt anger and then tears. The scene on the tournament field was absolutely heart wrenching. I fell in love with Royce Westmoreland. What a man! This was just an excellent story. Also, great stories were &quot;Whitney, My Love&quot; and &quot;Until You&quot; all three having to do with the Westmoreland men. I highly recomend all three books.  McNaught is very good, and she dares to deal with real life issues such as rape and that may not please all readers but it does me because that's the reality of life. I like my fantasy books to have reality in them. Thanks, McNaught.	2000-10-10

It was nice to read about two main characters that approached things with common sense and mature attitudes. It was delightful reading of how they grew in their knowledge of each other and their growing love. My favorite part was when Ranulf desired to please his wife in bed and sought advice on how to do this. I, also, loved how their love for each othe was finally expressed.  Ranulf was a charming character with his size, anger, humor, and gentleness. Reina was fun with her antagonist ability. I liked how they were both straightforward so that there wasn't a lot of misunderstanding between them or assumptions. The story did slow down towards the end. The ending did leave a smile on my face. Lindsey is excellent, she is one of my favorites!  I do wish that these romance authors would give a clue as to how to correctly pronounce some of the names of their characters, PLEASE!	2000-10-06

A story that makes a point that the inner person is what counts more than what you see. Great story of the rebuilding of belief in your self. Malcolm was so real, not phony in his dealings with Ariella, etc. I fell in love with him. Story has great passion and desire. Also, Ariella's inner warrior spirit - fantastic. I think this story would make a great drama - comedy movie. The training of Ariella's people was hilarious!  I did get worried if these two were ever going to have sexual intimacy. At about 3/4 way through the book, I just had to read ahead to see if and when it happened, and if after the build up, was the author going to give skimpy coverage to this event or the attention it deserved. Well, it was quite a love scene, full of passion, feelings, bonding, and all that both deserved especially Malcolm. He certainly knew how!  One negative about the story was that I found it hard to believe that Malcolm didn't catch on sooner that Rob was Ariella. This was my first reading of a book by Karyn Monk. I was impressed. I will soon read another to see if she is as good as this one says she is.	2000-09-28

However, I was disapointed.  I am a fan of Ms. Coulter, infact, she is my favorite author.  This was the first book that I've read of hers (and I have read many) that didn't totally measure up to her abilities. It was almost half way through the book before it started to get interesting. It was nice to know what became of the characters from Devil's Embrace, though not exciting. There were so many characters in this story that none other than Arabella and Kamal (they deserve the 3 star rating) seemed to get any real development. Adam and Rayna had potential but were not given the depth in development, they could of had their own book. The book finally got interesting when the story got into Arabella and Kamal, but this was the last half of the book if even that. Also, the story was less realistic than usual. Romance novels are fantasies and do lack, to a certain extent, in what the real world of love is or would be. The ending was brief and unbelievable in that after two months of pain, (Arabella thinking the relationship is over), he walks back into her life and she doesn't even question what the problem was. Oh well, not even Coulter is perfect.  As a side note: I wish all authors would give a clue as to how to correctly pronounce some of these names they use!	2000-09-25

The characters lived lives that were  realistic with their sexual laisons, etc.  I get tired of reality being  left out of romance books. Authors like Rogers who dare to include in their  stories such things as the incest the step father forced on Rowena  make  the stories more interesting.  This story has so many interesting and  shocking twist to it as the family history and relationships are revealed.   I fell in love with Lucas. He seemed to be such a senuous man.  The  relationship between him and Rowena was disturbing, erotic, and thankfully  ended positive.  I can't say enough about the twist in the stroy, these  twist and Lucas is what made this my all time favorite!!!	2000-09-18

I most enjoyed the dialogue  between the two main characters.  Their insults expressed to each other  were clever and humorous.  The sexual dialogue was blunt and  straightforward which was intertaining and humorous. These were two very  likeable and intertaining characters.  I highly recomend reading this book.   Ms. Coulter is extremely talented in the dialogue and humor aspects of her  characters!!	2000-09-12
