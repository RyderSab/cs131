Another title for this review could have been \\"Risky business\\".  It is the intriguing tale of a woman who has lived on the edge for most of her life, and who has experienced things you and I would never want to imagine.<br /><br />In a life story that the National Enquirer would have been proud to scoop, a headstrong and determined young woman named Yvonne Shilkin went against the tide, first carving a niche for herself as a singer, (a white, Australian Aretha Franklin), giving up that dream by refusing to compromise on her principles, marrying the man her mother warned her about, enduring a divorce from hell, witnessing the murder of her fianc&eacute;, and then finding love with a wonderful man, only to be kidnapped for eleven horrible days in Russia as a result of the couple's very lucrative but risky business ventures as barter/trade agents.<br /><br />Unknowingly and perhaps naively putting their eggs in the same basket with criminals and thugs, the couple's ordeal only came to a relatively happy ending thanks to a series of fortunate events, some dependable friends, a brilliant and well connected Russian lawyer and a sympathetic, ambitious and competent Russian Colonel.<br /><br />I say relatively happy, because the ordeal has had lasting effects on the author, leading to divorce, fear of victimization from the largely unpunished perpetrators, and financial ruin.<br /><br />On the other hand, the fat lady hasn't sung, and the story hasn't ended.  The author has since pulled herself together financially, found happiness with the soul mate she waited over forty years to find, and is now living with her extended family in the United States.<br /><br />This true story is simply told, and although the most brutal parts are not graphically described, what we are told is more than enough to understand the meaning of Primo Levi's words, \\"I am constantly amazed by man's inhumanity to man.\\"<br /><br />Rated 4.5 stars<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 11, 20052005 <br />	2005-10-11

Possessor of the title of Most High Academe by methods not quite orthodox, Vox is now a prisoner of his own machinations, his greatest triumphs usurped by those he once trusted.<br /><br />The hero of this book is again young Rook, the librarian-knight from book five.  Captured after losing his precious Stormhornet sky-craft while on patrol, he is sold into slavery and ends up in Vox's palace, as an assistant to Hestera Spikesap, an exciting new character with a lot going on in her kitchen and heart.  He meets the other minions of Vox - Speegspeel the goblin servant, Amberfuce the ghost-waif, and Flambusia, Amberfuce's nurse, and manages to get himself in the middle of most of the action which springs up in every chapter.<br /><br />Judging from the signs in the sky, a huge storm is brewing, which the Guardians of the Night believe will cure the stone sickness which has devastated New Sanctaphrax.  The natives are restless also, and it doesn't take much prompting to set Shrikes and Goblins against each other in a huge battle in the sewers beneath Undertown.<br /><br />There's more violence than usual in this one, and several mentions of the smell of unwashed bodies of various species.  It's also not as well thought out as the others, as major plot points happen too often by either chance or carelessness.  There are stories running concurrently that are sometimes hard to tie together, and lots of loose ends. There's even romance in the air along with the usual imaginative cast of creatures, but as usual, the illustrations truly bring the book to life.<br /><br />Not the best in the series, but packed with action and well worth reading.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 9, 2005	2005-10-09

His stories link the words \\"dark\\" and \\"funny\\" in the most peculiar ways, and this one adds \\"insanity\\" and \\"rebellion\\" to the mix.<br /><br />Someone is killing the valuable tourists and citizens of Miami, and a group calling itself \\"Nights of December\\" is claiming responsibility.  We get an inside view into this deadly but dysfunctional group of misfits, led by a brilliant but deranged tree-hugger type, and made up of a Seminole Indian millionaire, a washed up pro footballer with a drug habit, and a bumbling Cuban reject from another rebel group who likes blowing things up.<br /><br />Mix this up with the bizarre death of a local political figure, a missing Shriner, and the sacred institutions of the Orange Bowl and Beauty Pageant, and you have the makings of a great dark thriller with humorous twists throughout.<br /><br />Had I read this one first, I probably would have many more Hiaasen books under my belt, and I would heartily recommend starting your journey through his Miami here.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 3, 2005	2005-10-03

A semi-scientific, extremely funny, geeky love story emerges from chaos, which is embodied by a fad-obsessed, incompetent mail clerk named Flip.<br /><br />If you've ever entered an IKEA through the front entrance (instead of sneaking through the marketplace), you'll understand the \\"sheep\\" reference.  People walking along assigned pathways, eyes glancing downward nervously, following large black arrows on the floor, not daring to stray from the path, much less walk in the opposite direction.<br /><br />Sandra Foster works in a \\"Dilbert\\" type corporation, trying to work out what causes fads, from hairstyles to crossword puzzles.  Bennett O'Reilly works for the same corporation, studying chaos theories.  When these two get together thanks to a misdelivered package, things really start to get chaotic, compounded by the hiring of an assistant for Flip, who is (gasp) a SMOKER, and Management's efficiency meetings.<br /><br />Studying the behavioral patterns of a flock of sheep proves to be a lot harder than it looks (almost as hard as filling up a Corporation request for a paper clip) but through some coincidental occurrences they learn the secret of the wooly herd-followers the hard way.<br /><br />An enjoyably easy read, I especially liked the information on various fads at the beginning of each chapter.  Like most of the other people who've read this book, you'll probably like it.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, September 24, 2005	2005-09-24

As fate would have it, a bedraggled, injured young girl comes between him and his fiancee's plans for his future, and before he can focus his thoughts he is deeply involved in an underworld plot that he can't begin to understand, much less extricate himself.<br /><br />Colorful characters, dark humor and punny place names highlight the story, and the two really bad guys Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar are the best of the lot. The girl of course is far more important to the scheme of things than one would believe, and as the last known survivor of a family massacre, her special talent is in high demand, particularly to Croup and Vandemar's employer.<br /><br />With reluctant Richard, an Amazonian bodyguard, and a cunning con man named the Marquis of Carabas, the girl, with the unlikely name of Door, sets out on a quest to find out who wanted her family killed, and why.  Their journey takes them to a floating market that changes location each market day, through sewers, unused Underground railway stations, a monastery of Black Friars, through a labyrinth, and to an angel named Islington.<br /><br />Richard learns the hard way how to save himself from himself, and emerges from the living nightmare a much stronger and dirtier person. By the conclusion, he knows that home is where the heart is, and there's no place like home.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, September 18, 2005	2005-09-18

You'll also need to be able to translate Ebonics, understand computer jargon and to have eaten the obscure part of a large dictionary for breakfast.<br /><br />As spoofs go, this one is a pretty small book compared to the size of the reputation of the subject of the autobiography, but still manages to whole-heartedly disagree with almost everything the movie told us.<br /><br />A Guide to the players:<br /><br />Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader - Anykind Whystalker/Dearth Nadir<br /><br />Queen Amidala - Queen Mandala<br /><br />Qui-Gon Jinn - Chi-Gong Djinn<br /><br />Obi-Wan Kenobi - Kobe-San Kenbarbie<br /><br />Shmi Skywalker - Shmear Whystalker<br /><br />Yoda - Yoga<br /><br />Jar Jar Binks - Jug Jug Bling<br /><br />C-3PO - 3-CPU<br /><br />R2-D2 - R2-Me2<br /><br />Watto - W'at'o<br /><br />Seems Nadir's washed up as a Jeteye and doesn't have enough substance left to function as a bad guy, or any kind of guy for that matter, and is now reduced to telling his sorry tale via the mighty WWW dot com.<br /><br />According to Nadir, Mandala wasn't the upright, goody-goody white faced mannequin that Natalie Portman immortalized, but had pretty nimble fingers and a roving eye for young Jeteyes. Chi-Gong apparently had been ringing Ma Shmear's bells on the sly, and Kobe-San wasn't exactly a ladies man.  Jug Jug at least remains as annoying as ever, further destroying any hope of promoting the case for teaching Ebonics in better schools throughout the galaxy.<br /><br />This book is not easy reading, and is not for everybody.  Readers without a first degree in Lucas Lore will be completely on the dark side, and comprehending the phraseology is recurrently arduous, repeatedly requiring Herculean labors.  There's also a couple of chunks of inappropriate material for underage Jeteyes that don't really advance the story very much.<br /><br />If you're big on Star Wars, and spiffy with spoofs you'll probably like this one, if not, you probably won't.

Under the right circumstances, there's the possibility of blowing the earth to kingdom come, but the main focus for Ben and his secret society is discovering the secret of longer life.  As a side project, Ben is doing the \\"scientist-playing-God\\" thing, fiddling with DNA and microbe genes, and experimenting with a trusting giant octopus that hasn't been told that his reproductive days are over.<br /><br />Ben's adopted daughter Haley Walthers has been framed by the same big corporation, and when she gets a strange call from Ben, she falls headlong into a fight for her life against the psychopathic Officer Frick and his minions, who are trying to uncover Ben's secrets under the umbrella of the corporation.  What Frick doesn't count on is Haley's guardian angel Sam Wintripp, Ben's nephew, and full fledged ex-secret agent who majored in survival.<br /><br />Heavy on the action and even heavier on the science, some parts of this book will make your head spin, and some parts will have you turning the pages without breathing as the man and microbe hunt spirals out of control.  The heroics of the once wheelchair-bound long suffering hero are a tad overdone, and you can't help but think that the author had it in for this character big time.  His strength and perseverance seem endless, despite insurmountable odds, deadly enemies and a haunted past, and the romance subplot never amounts to anything much more than a plot device.<br /><br />Never-the-less, this book provides much food for thought, and should satisfy readers looking for an adrenaline fix.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, September 10, 2005subplot never amounts to anything much more than a plot device. <br /> <br />Never-the-less, this book provides much food for thought, and should satisfy readers looking for an adrenaline fix. <br /> <br /> <br />Amanda Richards, September 10, 2005 <br />	2005-09-10

Imagine my surprise while idling in the \\"Independent Reader\\" section of the bookstore, when I happened to come across a sequel to the classic original.<br /><br />The sequel starts us at the point where Charlie and his family are about to move into Willy Wonka's factory (now Charlie's of course), and in usual Wonka style he picks them up, bed and all, in a glass elevator with amazing capabilities.<br /><br />Due to an untimely misunderstanding and disagreement about falling several thousands of feet through a roof, the elevator and its unlikely astronauts are propelled into outer space, and find themselves in a weightless adventure saving the USA's commuter capsule from the clutches of the rampaging Vermicious Knids.<br /><br />This takes up most of the book, but once they are safely returned to Casa Wonka, the elderly family members succumb to the same lack of common sense exhibited by the children of the previous book, and swiftly get themselves into a little trouble by not listening to the Wonka-man's mumblings.<br /><br />Though not as entertaining or imaginative as the first, this one is full of humor and impossible but funny situations, and deserves 3.5 stars for weirdness alone.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, August 23, 2005	2005-08-23

If you haven't, you'll find it difficult to follow the exciting adventures of Thursday in the Outerworld, as she fights to save her eradicated husband, raise their paradoxical son Friday, stop Yorrick Kaine and the dastardly Goliath Corporation, foil an assassin, capture the Minotaur, bring about world peace, and win an un-winnable croquet match in the process.<br /><br />Taking a leave of absence from the Bookworld, Thursday reappears in the real world to find that the Goliath Corporation has ascended to new heights of mind control, Yorrick Kaine has inexplicably risen to power, her bosses are not particularly happy about her unauthorized 2 1/2 year absence, and she's got a downtrodden Hamlet, an amorous Emma Hamilton and a dashing Otto Bismarck to contend with.<br /><br />More than up to the task, but not quite sure how to sort anything out, she makes a deal with Goliath, visits the netherworld with vampire hunter Spike, and somehow ends up managing the local croquet team in an all-important championship match.<br /><br />One of Fforde's most imaginative novels, this one is highly recommended for fans of the Thursday Next series.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, August 20, 2005	2005-08-20

From the author of \\"Frindle\\" comes an entertaining little story about a rich kid with parents who spend more time at work than at home. They do try their best to be with him as much as possible, and make sure he has everything he needs, but it's just not enough.<br /><br />When his parents invest in a huge property in rural New Hampshire, Mark is relocated to the local school for a few months, and when he finds that the work is way below his intellectual level, he makes no effort to fit in, and behaves like a spoiled brat.<br /><br />However, when he begins exploring the new property, he makes all sorts of interesting discoveries, and overcoming his fear of the dark, he finds out that he quite likes camping and the outdoors.  Inspired by the books of Jack London, he signs up for the annual class outing, known as \\"A Week in the Woods\\", doing his online research to make sure he has everything he needs.  He also does some soul searching, and resolves to try to make friends at school and be a better person.<br /><br />This is not enough for one of his teachers, who is blinded by his first impressions of Mark, and lets this cloud his responsibilities as a teacher.  At the beginning of the week in the woods, Mark relaxes and starts enjoying himself, but things take a bad turn when the same teacher decides to send him back home for breaking one of the camp rules.<br /><br />What follows is the most exciting and informative part of the book, where we learn about survival, human nature and forgiveness.<br /><br />Recommended for ages 8-9, and kids who like camping out.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, August 16, 2005	2005-08-16

Still, I was able to follow along with the story of Charlie Bone, who has quite a few things in common with Harry Potter.<br /><br />He's got a bit of magic in him that he hasn't gotten under control as yet and he attends a special school for \\"endowed\\" children. (I dislike that term in this context) He has a couple of loyal friends to help him out and he's always in trouble as he tries to put things right.<br /><br />This time he has to rescue an invisible boy, find a cure for his bewitched uncle, catch a sorceror whom he helped escape from a painting, and battle the witchcraft of the evil Yolanda Yewbeam and his malevolent great-aunts who live in the dark side of town.<br /><br />There are quite a few characters to keep track of, and the story tends to get a little bogged down sometimes, but all in all, this book would be suitable for 8 to 9 year olds as a primer for Potter.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, August 15, 2005	2005-08-16

Thankfully, the books in this series come out much more quickly than the ones from J. K. Rowling , so I didn't have long to wait for \\"The Last of the Sky Pirates\\", the best in the series so far.<br /><br />Set fifty years after \\"Midnight Over Sanctaphrax\\" (book 3), it doesn't continue from book 4, the first chronologically in the series, which sounds awfully confusing, but actually isn't.  The Edge is a totally different place, with the mighty sky ships unable to fly, and New Sanctaphrax barely teetering on wooden supports after the dreaded stone sickness destroys the buoyant floating rocks.  The Librarian Academics have been driven underground into the sewers, where they have constructed a vast library of scientific studies, and are forced to send worthy young scholars on covert and perilous missions for training, before they complete their life's quest by studying and documenting their chosen field of nature study.<br /><br />In this book we follow the trail of young Rook Barkwater, a clever young under-librarian who is destined to become a Librarian Knight, doing research on the secret gatherings of banderbears, to whom he feels an unexplainable connection. His mission is dangerous and exciting, filled with wonderfully named, described and illustrated creatures that would otherwise defy the imagination.<br /><br />During his thrilling adventures, he meets Captain Twig, who was thought to have perished with his crew in book 3, and begins a whole new adventure to rescue Twig's friend Cowlquape from the prisons of the Most High Guardian of Night, the villainous scoundrel of this episode.<br /><br />Just as dark as the other books, but with a lot more action and adventure, I recommend this one heartily to fans of the series, but would advise newcomers to read at least books 1 to 3 first.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, August 8, 2005<br />	2005-08-09

I have no idea if the computer stuff is accurate, and if it is, it's certainly scary that people can track you with every step you make, but it makes for good reading anyway.<br /><br />The murder of a secretive uber-hacker named Bobby causes a lot of problems for Kidd and co, and it becomes a matter of life and death for them to retrieve Bobby's laptop, which contains enough dirt to bring down many major politicians, as well as Kidd, LuEllen and many more in the network.<br /><br />Fast paced, vividly detailed and extremely plausible, at least to non-techies, it makes for a quick and thoroughly entertaining read.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, August 8, 2005	2005-08-08

Unfortunately, we don't usually have the opportunity to go back and right the wrongs, but if you were by chance a newspaper columnist, you could certainly reflect on your earlier pearls of wisdom, reinforcing or shredding as the need arose.<br /><br />Telling it like it was, Michele VanOrt Cozzens reflects on a series of her articles, published back in the days when she was the PG-13 Carrie Bradshaw of Oakland.<br /><br />If you are fortunate enough to have read \\"I'm Living Your Dream Life\\", you're already on the inside track for this book, which touches on a range of topics, from home, family and friends through pets, Elvis, telemarketing, home improvement, beauty pageants, boxing, disc golf, and the Grateful Dead, among others.<br /><br />Running the gamut of emotions, the stories are about real life, and will touch chords of recognition in every reader.

However, for the dedicated few it can be richly rewarding, and we the vacationing public should be very grateful to them.<br /><br />An enjoyable read, even if you don't own or want to own a resort, and would be a very useful resort-etiquette guide for anyone considering being a guest in the future.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, July 10, 2005	2005-07-10

While Merced's marriage ends disastrously, and Gustavo fights to keep his together, Mani remains in awe of the fearsome animals that race down the Street of the Bulls in their last run before they end up on his slab, tenderly and skillfully converted to prime cuts for the waiting and appreciative customers.<br /><br />Full of local culture, nosy neighbors, steamy seduction and time honored male rituals of honor, this story is never boring, but subtly brings out the strength of the Cuban woman and the importance of family.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, July 2, 2005	2005-07-02

When Maebelle Hawkins decides to find herself a rich, handsome husband, nothing stands in her way - not common sense, not advice from her friends, not the well being of her children, and especially not the fact that the man she chooses is already married.<br /><br />What she doesn't want to accept is that Rufus Poygoode, the man she loves, is a mentally disturbed, emotionally scarred, heartless, cruel scoundrel, who is using her to avenge wrongs committed by the woman who abused him as a young man.  Rufus is a wealthy land owner and farmer, who also owns a \\"juke house\\" and brothel, and even though she is warned not to put her daughters in his care, she selfishly and blindly pursues her dream at the expense of her family.<br /><br />Once under Rufus' control, she loses all dignity, self-respect and worst of all, her family's freedom, as he uses her and her daughters to produce slave labor for his farm.  Amazingly, the entire community is aware of what is going on, but no-one does anything to assist the children, their only salvation coming when Rufus is forced to allow them to attend school.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Rufus, one of his offspring makes good use of her education, and when he goes too far by denying her college dream, she takes action to make him relinquish control.<br /><br />While the book gives every sordid detail of the harsh realities of life at the Poygoodes, it is marred by repetition and grammatical errors, and sometimes offers more information than is needed to get the point across effectively.  The ending also could have used a little tweaking.<br /><br />Obviously a writer of great talent and passion, Ms. Weaver should consider more effective editing for her next two books, which I understand are already underway.  This one is rated 3.5 stars.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, June 26, 2005re already underway.  This one is rated 3.5 stars.    Amanda Richards, June 26, 2005	2005-06-26

L. B. Matekoni's former residence.<br /><br />While following the Mercedes, Mma Ramotswe causes an accident, and this encounter leads to the introduction of an intriguing new character, Mr. Polopetsi, a man with some very useful talents and a troubled past.<br /><br />But do not think for a minute that Mma Ramotswe gets off without more than her fair share of trouble.  She is totally devastated when her ex-husband Note shows up demanding money, and she has to make the hardest decisions of her life while Mr. J. L. B.

This one takes off in new directions, and even new places, as Stephanie and her sidekicks wing out of New Jersey to tackle the casinos of Las Vegas, where even Ranger cannot tread.<br /><br />Stephanie and Ranger have been assigned to one of the most important cases in Vinnie's career, to hunt for a man who's skipped out on both his high profile visa bond and his living terror of a landlady.  Problem is, he's also made off with the landlady's daughter's dog, and that's where Stephanie draws the line.<br /><br />With pure Plumb luck on her side, she's soon hot on his tracks, and finds herself in the middle of a deadly game, with her own klutzy neck as the prize.  Deliveries of flowers fail to bring cheer, and when Ranger's associates start dropping like flies, the situation gets desperate, especially when Grandma Bella gets one of her visions.<br /><br />The one flaw is that the identity of the game's Web Master is terribly obvious to even the most casual reader of mysteries, but that doesn't detract much from the fun.<br /><br />Highly recommended to all Janet Evanovich fans.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, June 20, 2005	2005-06-21

While I was able to read \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" in two days, the sequel took me almost an entire week to complete.  It's not that it wasn't good, but it was significantly more put-downable than the first.  \\"The Edge of Reason\\" was hilariously funny in places, but had lost most of the simplicity and klutzy charm.<br /><br />I wouldn't expect or want Bridget to suddenly change for the better in just four weeks, but the opposite also applies, and I can't imagine how she lost so many brain cells in such a short period of time.  The old Bridget would stumble into embarrassing situations with alarming regularity, but this time she dives headlong with reckless abandon into increasingly more ridiculous situations, until you find the stretch a trifle uncomfortable.<br /><br />There are the usual weight swings, misunderstandings and goof-ups, but with the addition of a back-stabbing rival, a contractor from hell, a naked Filipino boy, an amorous dry cleaner, an African houseguest, Colin Firth and a nightmare holiday in \\"Paradise\\".<br /><br />I didn't much care for this Bridget, who seemed less in control of her life, making unbelievably bad decisions and being generally pathetic, depressing and helpless.<br /><br />Rated 3.5 stars.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, June 18, 2005	2005-06-18

It has a nice cover and all that, but the pages inside were a little low budget in appearance, and that psychologically made the recipes less exciting than they really are.<br /><br />Cooking definitely isn't a passion of mine, so the quickest and easiest recipes are the ones that appeal to me most.  However, without pictures of the finished product, I found it hard to choose recipes, because firstly, I want to see what I'm getting, and secondly, I really like seeing if my creation kinda looks similar to the professional one.<br /><br />One of my problems was getting some of the basic ingredients - there are a lot of capers and anchovies required - but people living in the USA shouldn't have a problem.  A lack of the various deli items and cheeses as well as the specialty bottled sauces made half the recipes impossible without substitution, but again, if you have these things close at hand you should do fine.<br /><br />The recipes are easy to follow, even though I noticed that one of them omitted to tell you when to put in a certain key ingredient, and they have cute names - nothing highbrow here.  I don't need step by step pictures, but some finished food shots would have made all the difference for me.<br /><br />Okay for experienced cooks looking for some quick recipes, but a bit underwhelming for beginners.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, June 12, 2005	2005-06-12

Recognizing a sign when I saw one, I started with the book, seeing that it was written before the movie, and things should, after all, go in their natural order.<br /><br />The first thing I had to do was go back in time a bit and try to remember my tables, when I realized that the little notations like 8st 11 were references to weight.  After spending a few moments contemplating the complexity of 14 times tables, I took out my calculator to work out that Bridget weighed 129 lbs at the first chapter.  This I thought was perfectly normal for a healthy young woman, and tried to remember if I had weighed that little at birth.<br /><br />Fast forwarding to the summary of this outrageously funny book, I can tell you that it is about the hilarious episodes that led to Bridget Jones drinking 3,836 units of alcohol, smoking 5,277 cigarettes, eating 11,090,265 calories, gaining 72 lbs and losing 73 within a calendar year.<br /><br />Laid out in the format of entries in a diary (hence the title - duh), we get the privilege of following every calamity and crisis of her romantic life (mostly pitiful), her weight swings (ongoing), her mother's midlife crisis (v.g.), her neurotic friends and their problems (numerous), her job exploits (unimpressive), her weakness for gambling on scratch cards (improvement required) and her cooking skills (non existent)<br /><br />Once you pick it up you'll want to finish it in one sitting, and I was laughing out loud without even caring that people were beginning to edge away from me. (not so good).  Just when you think you have the measure of the book, it picks up the pace in the last chapters, and turns into a madcap romp of pure reading pleasure.<br /><br />Highly recommended for everyone except males with commitment problems, those dreadful people who can eat all they want without gaining weight, and European con men.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, June 4, 2005> <br />Amanda Richards, June 4, 2005 <br />	2005-06-04

Of course, Ranger's jobs are never straightforward or well-defined, or even completely above board, and what follows is a delightful display of ineptitude and pure dumb luck, combined with that palpable tension whenever the two meet.<br /><br />Throw in a cranky little man, a fake bookie, and the case of the missing Uncle Fred, and you have the funniest adventure of the series.  Uncle Fred makes Scrooge look like a philanthropist, and when he disappears there is some concern, but not too many tears.  With Stephanie on the case, things turn deadly serious when she discovers some gristly pictures in Uncle Fred's effects, and then the bodies start showing up.<br /><br />Going through expensive cars like Snickers bars, she again proves that the only car she is capable of handling is the Buick war tank, and then there's the deranged boxer Ramirez out of jail and trying to save her soul. To crown it all, Joe Morelli is still around to twang her heartstrings and other body parts, and she's got Lula and Grandma Mazur in tow.<br /><br />Packed to the edges of the pages with humor, action and the inevitable mayhem, I'd definitely give my \\"high five\\" to High Five.<br /><br />Amanda Richards May 16, 2005	2005-05-17

With each visit, the Most High Academe has been growing weaker, and there are terrible secrets hidden within the ever-changing tunnels.<br /><br />While it is not necessary to have read the first three books, a little background is always helpful, and I would recommend reading at least book one before this one.<br /><br />A little stretched out in places, brilliant in others, the stage is now set for an incredible book five.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, April 17, 2005	2005-04-17

The said residents however include a stoned town constable, a Warrior Babe of the Outland, a lonesome divorcee, a depressed scientist, an icy shrink and a man with a talking bat; so obviously, this is not your normal everyday tale of Christmas joy and glad tidings.<br /><br />While quite an intriguing concept, there are several chapters that intentionally border on the B-movie boundary that may not appeal to all readers, but if you have a weird and warped sense of humor, you should give this one a shot.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, April 15, 2005	2005-04-16

That makes it priceless.<br /><br />My one teeny tiny little gripe is that the style of lettering used for those important ten words is different to what is being taught in nursery school.  The \\"a\\" that he learned is more like a circle with a stroke, the \\"g\\" in the book is the one with the closed loop at the bottom, and the \\"W\\" in the book looks like two overlapping \\"V\\"s.

Having miraculously survived to the sixth installment of this humorous series of misadventures in bounty hunting, the ditsy ex-salesgirl now faces her toughest challenge yet.<br /><br />This time the job seems doomed to failure from the start, as she gets assigned the task of tracking down the mysterious Ranger, an easy task if you know how to catch smoke and pin it down.  As a bonus, she's being followed by two clueless goons, bodies are turning up, and a very dangerous \\"family\\" member catches her up a tree in his backyard.<br /><br />To make matters worse, her grandmother's on the rampage - learning to drive, picking up guys, and totally messing up Stephanie's lust life - and just when you thought you'd seen it all,  she's been conned into ownership of the world's largest pooping dog.<br /><br />Throw in her arch rival Joyce, her gun toting super-sized sidekick Lula, and a new assignment to bring in a crazy homicidal maniac arsonist, and you get an idea of Hot Six, one of the most character intensive installments in the series.<br /><br />If you can control your natural inclination to slap some sense into the heroine, and get over sharing Morelli's pain by biting your lower lip, you should enjoy this one.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, April 7, 2005	2005-04-07

Like all her other assignments, this one sounds easier than it looks, and before you can say \\"pepper spray\\" things start heating up.

After book one, I jumped right to this one (because I didn't have a copy of book two).<br /><br />Stephanie Plum is, as usual, way over her head in her unchosen profession.  Untrained, uncoordinated, dysfunctional and disorganized, she's the world's most unlikely bounty hunter - a definite Sandra Bullock role if they decide to make the movie.<br /><br />This time her main task is simply to track down the town saint, a well-loved candy man with a devoted following of little old ladies, and a stable of nasty goons on the side.<br /><br />Suddenly people are shooting at her, drug dealers are turning up dead, her vehicles don't work, and her new sidekick is a former hooker with an attitude and a craving for action - once it's not too dangerous.<br /><br />Acknowledging her limitations, she calls on professional bounty hunter Ranger (part to be offered to Sam Elliot if I have a say in casting) and police officer Morelli (think Colin Farrell), her primary weakness in the romantic department.<br /><br />After all the expected twists and turns, and the unexpected twists and turns, this turns out to be a wildly funny and entertaining read.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, April 1, 2005	2005-04-01

Beneath the horsey smiles, the self-conscious snorty laughter and the other public facades, lie the real people - the repressed and the depressed, the bored and the ignored, the bullies and the blusterers, those waiting for something to happen, and those that do something about it.<br /><br />Penelope Lively carefully develops her characters, unpeeling the fragile exteriors layer by layer, never causing embarrassment, but stripping them to the bone never-the-less. From time to time she pauses to reveal the darker side, but does so without breaking the surface tension, and the story flows onwards.<br /><br />My problem with the story is that, like an enquiring mind, I wanted to know more.  I know \\"who\\", I know \\"where\\", I know \\"when\\", but the author leaves me helplessly dangling on the \\"how\\" and \\"why\\".<br /><br />This is an entertaining peek into little Laddenham, but Penelope Lively pulls the blinds before we can get a fully satisfying look.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, March 17, 2005	2005-03-17

With more of the same.<br /><br />While not so good as a stand alone (you'll be lost in time & space without the background of Book 1), this second in the umpteen-part, increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker's Trilogy tries even harder than the first to laser your funny bone.<br /><br />Seems that the thing we call (ultimately to be used-to-call) Earth is really just a mighty big supercomputer, built to work out the ultimate question to the ultimate answer, 42.  Like all expensive software however, just before it actually does whatever it's supposed to do, it crashes - in this case due to the hacker Vogons and their total annihilation programme.  Unlike your regular hard drive, two bits escape to byte another day, and we continue their story.<br /><br />In one of the many funny lines from the book, Zaphod Beeblebrox remarks, \\"I am so hip I have difficulty seeing over my pelvis\\".  This book is just as hip.<br /><br />Our heroes are aboard their Improbability Driven spaceship, when Arthur Dent happens to tie up all the computer circuits just when the Vogons are launching an attack.  Zaphod decides its time to see dead people, and with a strange twist, he and miserable Marvin, the depressed computer, disappear, while Arthur takes a tea break.<br /><br />Zaphod materializes elsewhere and immediately starts looking for the man who rules the Universe, while Marvin continues to depress and be depressed.  In my humble opinion, Marvin is the star of this book, but I digress.<br /><br />After having his sense of perspective sorely tested, Zaphod improbably conjures a happy reunion, although this leaves him sadly out of pocket.  Deciding that they should find the nearest place to eat, their ship's computer zaps them to Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe.<br /><br />From this half-way point, the book takes off on a fresh tangent of humor, floor shows, loud rock bands, talking meat, and wicked vehicles - that is, until the universe ends.<br /><br />Then the humor starts all over again.<br /><br />A very worthy follow up to the famous first.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, March 7, 2005<br /> <br />Then the humor starts all over again. <br /> <br />A very worthy follow up to the famous first. <br /> <br />Amanda Richards, March 7, 2005 <br />	2005-03-07

A fugitive, a hot chick and a manic depressive robot do not usually make for happy endings, even with a little improbability thrown in.<br /><br />The adventure continues as they learn the simple answer to the great question of Life, The Universe, and Everything, only to realize that they don't know the question.<br /><br />Going now to fix me a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, and start the second of the increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker's Trilogy.

To tell the truth, this book has been sitting on the shelf for over six months, because of all the frightening reports - why go willingly into a situation that is widely known to be addictive?<br /><br />I was hesitant to get involved, but a chorus of voices kept haranguing me to make the first step, and weakened by a lack of excuses, I succumbed.<br /><br />This is actually a very complicated book, due to the various levels of humor, from slapstick to dry one-liners, expertly delivered in an incredible fantasy setting.  After you get a basic understanding of the geography of the Discworld, and work out the meaning of \\"hubward\\", \\"rimward\\", \\"turnwise\\" and \\"widdershins\\", and that there are eight seasons, you can enjoy the relatively simple story that unfolds in the last two thirds of the book.  Beware though of the many familiar references to our own world, which are thrown in randomly to retard your progress while you stop to consider them.<br /><br />A bungling wizard (with a charmed life and one good spell in his arsenal) gets saddled as a tour guide to a naive visitor from another continent.  Unfortunately, the tourist has a lot of gold to throw around, and this leads to all kinds of unwanted attention from the dregs of society.  Luckily for the tourist, he has a very useful piece of luggage that doubles as a body guard, and is self-transporting with a built in homing device - a dream suitcase if there ever was one.<br /><br />Here there be trolls, barbarians, bandits, beauties, dragons, magic, deities, and even Death, who gets quite stressed on the job, and really needs a holiday.<br /><br />Now that I'm corrupted, I need volunteers to feed my habit.

Or that Goldilocks wore red because her mother got a great deal on a bolt of red cloth?  Or even that those dragon fights were rigged?<br /><br />Okay, I still love fairy tales, but after reading this collection, you realise that the Grimm Brothers and Anderson and the other famous story tellers wrote stories with plots that would never hold up today. They were also much too long - this little 110 page (big print) book, holds ten fractured fairy tales, taking a rib-tickling half an hour to read (slowly).<br /><br />It's a children's book sure enough, but even grown-ups (especially the young at heart) will appreciate the skewering of the cherished tales of Goldilocks, Snow White, Cinderella, The Princess and the Pea, Jack & The Beanstalk, The Frog Princess, King Midas, and more.<br /><br />This book tells it the way it really was - before those interfering writers went and changed them up to be politically correct.

Mr. Twit has the nastiest, ugliest beard known to mankind, the only thing nastier and uglier being Mrs. Twit with her glass eye.  They take pleasure in playing horrible practical jokes on each other, being unpleasant to their four pet monkeys, and catching birds to make bird pie.<br /><br />Of course, nasty people cannot be expected to come to a good end, and the monkeys craftily strategize to turn the tables on the horrible couple.<br /><br />The underlying moral here is that no matter what you look like physically, if you have good thoughts, they will shine right through and make you a beautiful person, and of course the opposite also unfortunately applies.<br /><br />Be nice to someone today and let the sunlight stream from your face.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, February 17, 2005	2005-02-18

It also skims the surface of the trauma of moving to a new city away from your friends, having a new baby in the family, and having your parents switch their traditional parental roles.<br /><br />These issues are skillfully woven into a funny context, but the book can be interpreted at a much deeper level than it first appears.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, February 17, 2005	2005-02-18

How can you resist a book that begins with \\"It was a dark and stormy night\\"?  Those seven little words can set the imagination racing in anticipation of a frightfully exciting story.<br /><br />This one is a time travel story with a sci-fi angle, except there are no confusing paradoxes or problems with the butterfly effect. As far as the author is concerned, you should just bend it a little and charge right in.<br /><br />This is also one of those rare books where the supporting characters are much more interesting than the main characters.<br /><br />Meg Murry is a very central character, but she's rather hard to like, not too bright and very whiny.  She's understandably devastated to learn that her father doesn't make the sun rise, and that the world doesn't revolve at his command.<br /><br />Her brother Charles Wallace is more interesting, as he has a fledgling sixth sense thing going on, and at five years old he not only speaks perfectly, but has his mother's permission to use the stove.  (That's a serious matter Ms. Engle)<br /><br />Their new friend Calvin O'Keefe is not fully developed as a character, and neither are Meg and Charles' parents, Dr. Murry and Dr. Murry.<br /><br />On the other hand you have Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who and Mrs Which, as well as Aunt Beast, who guide the children on their quest to save Dr. Murry.  These are really great characters, and I look forward to reading more about them in books to come.<br /><br />This is obviously the first book of a series, and judging by the ending, not the last I'll be reading.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, February 14, 2005	2005-02-15

As a suspense novel, it does a little better, but the ending drags it down considerably.  The jury is still out on the intriguing subplots, because I seemed to have missed them completely.<br /><br />If you have enjoyed other books by this author, and are having a slow afternoon, maybe this book will serve to pass a few hours, but wouldn't be the best choice if you've got other stuff on your to-read list.  It's a 2.5 star effort at best.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, February 5, 2005	2005-02-06

The book banishes all fear of the lavish use of color, clearly illustrating how color can enhance your surroundings, making a cozy nest of warmth and harmony.<br /><br />The furniture and accessories are all rustic and simple, the formula being wood, iron, stone, tile and carpet.<br /><br />If you're the Victorian or romantic type, there's no toile de joie in lavender and pink in this book, no overstuffed chairs or furniture bearing the legs of any deceased monarch. If however, you're into relaxed, simple, harmonious, rustic and durable decor, this is a good book to use as a guide.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, February 3, 2005	2005-02-04

What ignited even hotter was their passion for each other, and under the billowing smoke, they hatched a plan for a new start in America, jiggling the lifeboats all the way to New York.<br /><br />Their son Milton eventually married his cousin Tessie, producing a strangely-named son Chapter Eleven, and another child who became their strange daughter Calliope.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Calliope, the sins of Lefty and Desdemona began the awakening process of a little recessive gene which pushed its way to the nether regions of the second grandchild, forming a little extra something to Calliope's feminine format.<br /><br />Due to a half-blind doddering Doctor acquaintance, this development is overlooked for years, until more observant doctors at the emergency room make the discovery of the little flagpole.<br /><br />Referred to a specialist, Calliope tells the doctor exactly what he wants to hear, and after sneaking a peek at the medical chart, beats a hasty exit, emerging from the uncomfortable female cocoon as an uncoordinated young man named Cal.<br /><br />The story from here moves quickly, as Cal puts his Adam's apple forward (this should have been a giveaway long before) and finds himself quite literally in hot water up to his neck, until he ultimately finds his niche and learns to be comfortable with himself.<br /><br />There are many stories supporting the main theme, some of which are like \\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\\", and some more like \\"American Pie\\".  Add bootlegging, drugs, fast food and silkworms, throw in a little racism, religion, extortion and a peep show or two - and there you have \\"Middlesex\\".<br /><br />A bit hefty, but never boring.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, January 28, 2005005	2005-01-28

Of course, there are very practical reasons that Jamie was the chosen one, and after Claudia tears down his defenses, he becomes a willing accomplice.<br /><br />The story tells of their grand adventure, and how they were able to survive undetected inside the Met for a whole week.

He soon discovers that he hasn't got the testicular fortitude for recent events, and starts falling to pieces.<br /><br />Although highly implausible, full of coincidences, and overly long, the colorful characters and graphic imagery combine with the dark humor to make this worthwhile, if rather light reading.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, January 8, 2005	2005-01-09

Only this time, he's not a lawyer dabbling in torts (as per \\"The King of Torts\\"), but a journalist who takes over a newspaper in Clanton in the seventies.  He's got cheap accommodation, a couple of local characters to help him along, a rich relative, and lots and lots of good luck, all of which combine to make him a success story.<br /><br />The brutal rape and murder of a local woman sells a lot of newspapers, and his fearless coverage of the case and subsequent trial make him a lot of friends, but also some deadly enemies, particularly the secretive underworld bootlegging family of the accused killer Danny Padgitt.<br /><br />It's a pleasant enough story about the affairs of a small town and the running of a small newspaper, and covers cook-outs, drinking, families, obituaries, Sunday sermons, poker, cornbread and chitlins, as well as racism and the closing of small businesses by the wheels of progress, but it's when the lawyers and legal system are called into action that things get ugly.<br /><br />The plot thins towards the end, when people who served on the jury for the murder case start getting killed, and everybody keeps barking up a convenient tree when their reason for doing so makes no sense whatsoever.<br /><br />The ending is somewhat anticlimactic, with hints being thrown here and there in earlier chapters, and Grisham again wraps it up as quickly as possible.<br /><br />All things considered though, it's a good read, and one of his better ones in recent times.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, December 30, 2004	2004-12-30

Surprises are definitely not welcome, and he likes everything to be predictable and according to a prescribed schedule.<br /><br />On the negative side however, he's only fifteen, he's autistic, he's got more phobias than Adrian Monk, and his fractured family haven't yet learned how to cope with his illness.<br /><br />Christopher often determines what type of day he's going to have by the number of cars of a specific color that pass in a row, and when he finds the neighbor's dog impaled on a garden fork, it must have been a Black Day indeed.  The death of poor Wellington brings out his inner Sherlock, and he is determined to solve the case, working in his logical fashion, despite the objections of his father.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this investigation uncovers a lot more than the identity of the canine garden fork killer, and he is faced with several difficult emotional issues which his mind is unable to handle.<br /><br />Brilliantly told in the words of Christopher himself, this novel allows the reader a rare look into the world of autism, or as much of it as we presently understand, and shows clearly the challenges an autistic person faces on a daily basis.<br /><br />The mathematics and logic puzzles may not be for everyone, but I especially liked \\"The Monty Hall Problem\\", which I pondered for a long time before agreeing that the \\"vos Savant\\" solution is the most logical.  Now at least I know that if I were ever called up for a game show that required me to choose from three closed doors, I should cross my fingers and switch as quickly as possible, even if one third of me knows I'll still get Monty's goat.<br /><br />Eloquently told in simple language, this book is a must read for young adults and old adults alike, especially those with a penchant for a drastically different outlook on life.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, December 19, 2004fferent outlook on life. <br /> <br />Amanda Richards, December 19, 2004	2004-12-20

Stanley Yelnats (a great name whichever way you read it) is always in the wrong place at the wrong time, and this particular time, it leads him to a stay at Camp Green Lake.<br /><br />In reality, Camp Green Lake is a juvenile detention facility, with neither greenery nor a lake, run by a tough warden whose fingernails drip rattlesnake venom when she's upset.<br /><br />Like all the other inmates, Stanley has to dig himself a hole every day, starting before sunrise, and ending when a perfect five foot diameter by five foot deep hole has been dug.  Water breaks are scarce, and one always has to be on the lookout for rattlers, killer lizards, and any strange artifacts that the warden may be interested in.<br /><br />Skillfully switching from past to present, Louis Sachar fills in the background and ties it into the present, so we quickly learn than the warden is up to something, and that the character-building holes may not be what they profess to be.<br /><br />Winning the friendship of the resilient little Zero through the exchange of talents, Stanley makes an unplanned escape, and while solving the mystery, accidentally discovers that certain diets can be extremely important to survival.<br /><br />A short, well written, easy to follow novel, which can be read in one sitting.

(Both Puff and Minerva have links to the secret Elcarim Foundation, so there's bound to be trouble afoot)<br /><br />What follows is a real page turner, with singing sirens, exploding lemonade, malevolent hermit crabs and kamikaze flying fish, and that's just the beginning.<br /><br />Following the trail past ghosts and fairies, water sprites and dragons, they fly, float, fall and flee, always barely managing to keep a half step ahead of disaster.<br /><br />After riding a dragon to the Arctic Ocean, sailing a ship of ice, and finding herself devoid of human company on an enchanted island, Alexandra finally learns to release the link with the past that holds her back, and to believe in herself.<br /><br />The story ends with a disappointingly anticlimactic rescue, and a tantalizing glimpse of the Elcarim Foundation, a kind of Star Wars Council/United Nations/Hogwarts mix hidden behind a waterfall.  Sadly, we are left on a string as to the whereabouts of the mysterious bad guy Malrot - mentioned, feared, but never revealed.<br /><br />A very good start to a promising series for young readers.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, November 4, 2004	2004-11-04

It is written in simple language, and is short enough and exciting enough to hold the attention of even the most restless reader.<br /><br />The three main characters are the children of the Grace family, Jared, Simon and Mallory, who move into a dilapidated mansion, and stumble upon a world of magical folk.<br /><br />With the aid of the Field Guide of the title, which Jared discovers after solving a riddle he finds in a secret room, they begin their adventures in the faerie world, realizing that they have just glimpsed the tip of the fantasy iceberg.<br /><br />Though not a challenging read for older folk, this book provides good groundwork for future forays into the world of Narnia, Lemony Snicket and Artemis Fowl, though not necessarily in that order.<br /><br />Magically lure your 6 to 10 year olds into the world of fantasy - get them The Spiderwick Chronicles today.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 27, 2004	2004-10-28

It is however difficult to guess what other new adventures could sequentially follow, as this one seems to have thrown every possible fantasy genre plot into the pot, shaken as opposed to stirred.<br /><br />It contains almost every fictional or mythical creature ever to appear in a fantasy book - centaurs, satyrs, dryads, witches, dwarves, goblins, griffins, wolves, bears, ettins, dragons, even a phoenix, among others.<br /><br />From the beginning, readers would find it easier going if they made little notes on the characters, because the author introduces them faster than a speeding griffin, often with the depth of a trickling brook.<br /><br />It is extremely fast paced, and written in simple style for young readers, a style which may not appeal to older folk. Young fans of fantasy should however have fun reading this book, which as mentioned before has more action than should physically be able to fit between the pages.<br /><br />Careful reading will reveal a little mistake that slipped by the editors.

It seemed to me to be an expansion of \\"Lost in a Good Book\\", written to set the stage for \\"Something Rotten\\".<br /><br />Stop shaking your heads - it's a good book, filled with adventure and incidental stories, but essentially Thursday's story doesn't advance very far from book two.  She's still pregnant, Landon doesn't exist yet, and she's still hiding out in the BookWorld.<br /><br />This time, Fforde takes us through the Great Library and Well of Lost Plots in much greater detail, and his imagination is as fertile as ever, making book lovers purr with excitement as characters from great works of fiction interact with each other.<br /><br />The BookWorld is a fascinating place, where grammasites stampede around changing text, spam has infiltrated the footnoterphone system, and plot devices are sold like cheap Rolexes.  Dangerous creatures abound, real and fictional, human, animal and half bred, and the vast Text Sea can change the flow of booklife at any time.<br /><br />Thursday must overcome pregnancy limitations, the deaths of her coworkers in Jurisfiction, and insidious plots; deal with dodo rearing, training of generic characters, and saving her less than perfect book-home, and also rack her brains to defeat the memory changing Aornis Hades. The worst challenge of all is something even more terrifying - something that drives fear into the hearts of people everywhere - the dreaded computer software upgrade.<br /><br />Jasper Fforde is still very clever, but this time he's not as punny.<br /><br />Warning: Not recommended to be read without the benefit of the first two novels.<br /><br />Amanda Richards October 16, 2004	2004-10-16

There's just one drawback - and of course it's a BIGGIE - it provides an access route to the Lower Elements, endangering the fairy way of life.<br /><br />Having accidentally handed the cube on a platter to Jon Spiro, a ruthless American businessman, Artemis is faced with the challenge of his life, but he's helpless without the good folk of Haven City - plus reinforcements.<br /><br />This time, Artemis needs two strong women behind him to make him look good - the fairy of his dreams, Captain Holly Short (a Sandra Bullock/Kim Possible mix) and Juliet Butler (a Lucy Liu/Uma Thurman type).  Teamed with the dwarf digging sensation, and Haven City's resident centaur genius, Artemis still has to use every last ounce of his cunning and intellect to formulate a retrieval plan, while surprises lurk around every corner.<br /><br />Can Jon Spiro break the Eternity Code before Artemis can retrieve the cube?<br /><br />Can Artemis survive this last encounter?<br /><br />Can the LEP mind wipe make Artemis forget his friends and adventures?<br /><br />Can Artemis give up his life of crime and become a part of a normal family unit?<br /><br />The first three answers will be revealed to you as you read this book.<br /><br />The last?

Having eaten my way through the first book like a dwarf burrowing through loosely-packed earth, I found this one slightly slower going.  My new favorite genius-millionaire-criminal mastermind is now a teenager and he's not as tough and full of brass as he was in book one.<br /><br />Cut him some slack though, his mommy's back to normal, and ready to start trying to control his life, and he's just discovered that his dad is still alive, and being held for ransom by the Russian Mafiya in a nuclear submarine graveyard.  Even geniuses have their limits.<br /><br />Captain Holly Short isn't having a good time either.  After Artemis successfully procured half of the Recon ransom fund in book one, she's been given a \\"time-out\\" doing stakeouts for smugglers for the Customs and Excise Department.  It seems that someone is organizing the dim-witted goblins to do some good old fashioned gun running, and of course, our intrepid heroine lands herself in the middle of the melee.<br /><br />Opal Koboi is a new character, a pixie with talents to rival the resident geek Foaly the Centaur, and has absolutely no scruples whatsoever.<br /><br />Someone has been re-engineering laser guns to work with regular AA batteries, and Holly feels that Artemis is involved.  Artemis would rather get along with the process of rescuing his father, but after an interrogation proves Holly incorrect, they team up as an unlikely pair of secret agents to solve both problems.<br /><br />What follows is action galore, as the book accelerates to warp speed, and even Artemis is forced to be a hero, albeit a puny little one.  Each of our favorite characters from book one takes center stage at one time or the other and even Mulch becomes a leading dwarf with a pivotal role.<br /><br />The story ends with a crazy rescue plan that goes terribly wrong, until girl power again triumphs over rotten luck.<br /><br />A wonderful follow on from the first book, and an encouraging preview to the third.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 6, 2004.<br /> <br />Amanda Richards, October 6, 2004. <br />	2004-10-07

I may not be that young, but as I've been told repeatedly that I've yet to grow up, I think I can easily qualify as a \\"young\\" adult reader.<br /><br />This is a book that I had a lot of fun reading.  I even busted the code (believe me - not a hard task) and started deciphering the code at the bottom of each page.  I'm sitting here with a soft pencil, decoding like a cub scout with a secret decoder ring.<br /><br />Eoin Colfer is a genius, with a vivid imagination and a wonderfully wicked sense of humor.  He has produced a well thought out novel, nicely bound and presented, somehow combining a brilliant 12 year old millionaire criminal mastermind, a loyal butler named Butler who just happens to be a killing machine, a dwarf with a mighty forceful tunneling action, a techie wise-cracking centaur who can give Ian Fleming's \\"Q\\" a run for his money, a tough military-type girl scout fairy and her old fashioned boss, a havoc wrecking troll, and a support cast of dozens.<br /><br />It's got magic, intrigue, deception, kidnapping, blackmail, computers, weapons, code-breaking, violence, and projectile flatulence and can't be faulted for the sheer brilliance of the scheming.<br /><br />As soon as I finish my decoding, I'm off to book 2, \\"The Arctic Incident\\".

The names of his characters are again imaginative and amusing, and his concept brilliant.<br /><br />We rejoin our reluctant heroine Thursday Next, as she opposes the Goliath Corporation in a quest to restore her husband, who has been maliciously erased from the pages of history.<br /><br />Just to make it more challenging, she's pregnant, and with this new turn of events she isn't sure who the father is.  The rent is also due, and she has to contemplate doing a moonlight stake-out to make ends meet.<br /><br />\\"Simple\\" you say - but nothing's simple in Jasper Fforde's world. A multitude of strange, possibly deadly coincidences, the discovery of a new play by Shakespeare, and the little secret that the world is going to end in a sea of pink goo in a few days makes things a bit more complicated.<br /><br />\\"Is that all?\\" you ask - Nope, she's also supposed to learn how to bookjump with the Jurisfiction group, with training from the feisty Miss Havisham of Great Expectations, and venture without permission into Poe's dangerous classic poem \\"The Raven\\" to retrieve a well-lodged Schitt. She also has to battle an enemy even worse than Acheron Hades, while at the same time appearing as a defendant in a SO-1 hearing and attend a trial within a literary classic.<br /><br />It's all in a day's work for our Gal Thursday, even though she's now hearing voices in her head, but this time she's got to get lost for a while until the heat dies down, and we look forward to Mr. Fforde digging her out and dusting her off in the next episode.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, September 22, 2004	2004-09-23

It is vastly different from any of the other books, and is the one most laden with theology and imagery.<br /><br />The ruler at the time is King Tirian, and he soon has his hands full.  Lantern Waste is being destroyed, apparently in the name of Aslan, and along with Jewel the Unicorn, Tirian must get to the bottom of the mystery.  Closer investigation reveals that men from Calormen are cutting down the Narnian forest, astonishingly being assisted by talking Narnian animals.<br /><br />But there is treachery afoot, and a false prophet succeeds in confusing the living daylights out of the Narnians, until they no longer can distinguish wrong from right, or Aslan from Tash, the God of the Calormenes.<br /><br />Eustace and Jill are again summoned to the rescue, returning one year after their last adventure, but in fact over two hundred years have passed in Narnia since \\"The Silver Chair\\".<br /><br />The story rapidly advances, with the age old theme of good against evil. The most important physical place in the story is a stable, which has a lot more to it than is immediately evident.  People who believe in a supreme being see amazing things within, non-believers see nothing at all.  People and animals that pass through its humble door are rewarded according to their purity of heart, and are appropriately greeted by either Aslan or Tash.<br /><br />The somewhat abrupt ending came as a surprise to me, especially after the joyous reunions and discovery of the true Narnia, even though there had been hints casually dropped along the way.<br /><br />This is a fine book to end a wonderful series, a classic if ever there was one,<br /><br />Amanda Richards, September 17, 2004	2004-09-18

Continuing through the Chronicles of Narnia, \\"Prince Caspian\\" is the fourth novel chronologically, and the second published.  Because of the order in which the books were written, this book takes up where \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" left off, with the four Pevensies being called back to Narnia by magic, one year later in their time, but eons later in Narnian time.<br /><br />In the blink of an eye, the children are transported from a train platform, (not Platform 9 ¾), into the forests of Narnia, soon discovering the ruins of Cair Paravel, where they once ruled as Kings and Queens.  After eating enough apples to keep the doctor away for a very long time, they rescue a Dwarf from certain peril, and begin another fascinating adventure together.<br /><br />The present King Miraz is doing his best to stifle the stories of old Narnia, where animals talk, and Naiads and Dryads and Dwarfs and Fauns were a part of daily life, and becomes highly upset when he discovers that his nephew Caspian has been drinking up the folklore, thanks to his devoted nurse, who of course gets the boot shortly after that. Unbeknownst to Miraz, the new tutor is also a closet Narnia believer, who begins his \\"Introduction to Narnia 101\\" and helps Caspian to escape impending doom.<br /><br />Learning that his usurping Uncle Miraz is up to no good, Caspian flees for his life, where by good fortune he is saved by some of the same Narnian creatures he has been dying to encounter. Having established his right to the throne of Narnia, King Caspian begins his first great adventure by getting acquainted with talking animals, dwarfs and other Narnians.  Inspired by the great Centaur Glenstorm, a council of war is quickly organized, to make plans for an overthrow of the present government.<br /><br />Unfortunately, before he can warm up to the job, his runaway horse inadvertently gives the game away, and rather too soon, war breaks out.  With the magical mound known as Aslan's How as their command center, in the midst of the mysterious woods, the battle does not go well, due to inexperience.<br /><br />Playing his last hole card, King Caspian blows the magical horn, and sure enough, without a moment to spare, help arrives via the Pevensies, former Kings and Queens of Narnia, \\"located\\" by Trumpkin, the rescued dwarf.  Getting there however, was almost another adventure altogether, with boys who don't ask for directions, and don't listen to good advice.  With the appearance of Aslan, and their faith duly restored, they reach their destination late but safely.<br /><br />The boys are tasked with straightening things out, and issue a challenge to Miraz, to duel for the right to rule.  Circumstances then lead to a great and glorious battle, while the girls team up with Aslan to do some back-up work, right some wrongs, and perform a miracle or two.

There are at least two chapters that unapologetically say absolutely nothing, and do not advance the story in any way.<br /><br />Maybe I was just too impatient to get to the \\"meat\\" of the story, and got frustrated with the rambling.<br /><br />As I said, maybe it's just me.<br /><br />The characters are very Tom Robbins, especially Sissy Hanshaw, the super-sized digited ugly duckling who grew up to be a hitchhiker, model and cowgirl, the delightfully named Bonanza Jellybean, ranch boss and all cowgirl, the hygienically challenged Countess with castanets for teeth, Delores del Ruby, whip maestro and forewoman, and the Chink, pecker waving yam lover.<br /><br />Parts of the story are very similar to \\"Jitterbug Perfume\\", especially if you consider the Chink as an oriental Pan, all musky and ready to rut, and compare the Clockworks tribe to the Bandaloop, both of whom possess the wisdom of the ages and are more finely attuned to nature than the rest of us.<br /><br />Readers of \\"Still Life\\" will note that \\"O O Spaghetti O\\" makes about as much sense as \\"Ha ha ho ho and hee hee\\"<br /><br />There's a wonderful storyline here, with our thumb-tied heroine struggling to find herself, the all cowgirl ranch, and the interrupted migration of the protected whooping cranes, but alas, it was hidden amongst the rambling passages, and I almost couldn't see the story for the words.<br /><br />In my opinion, not a good beginner's guide to Tom Robbins - there are better - but still a clever concept teeming with physical and spiritual love, nature and magic, cultural differences, freedom, overcoming handicaps and of course, hitchhiking.

Jasper Fforde has hatched an absolutely brilliant concept for a story, which after a somewhat slow start, picks up nicely, and holds you tightly between its pages until the ending.<br /><br />With its clever wordplay and colorful names, the comedy meter registers on high, but the story can be hard to follow in places. It involves time travel, science fiction, inventions, detectives, cloak and dagger stuff, criminals, intrigue, deception, greed, romance, war, werewolves, extinct animals, highly evolved bookworms, and of course,literature. There's even a little sub story involving the undead and a Stoker, which looks like an \\"aside\\" until everything comes together in a rush of excitement.<br /><br />My favorite character names are Thursday Next, Braxton Hicks, Runcible Spoon, Paige Turner, Styx Hades and not forgetting Jack Schitt.<br /><br />This book serves as an advertisement for the reading or re-reading of Martin Chuzzlewitt and Jane Eyre, and even dares to question Shakepeare himself.<br /><br />In short, it deals with the theft of original manuscripts that shake the world of literature, fictional characters that disappear and reappear where they shouldn't, and throws in some Alice in Wonderland mixed with The Silence of the Lambs.  It teaches that weapons of mass destruction aren't always what they seem, and that you should never underestimate the power of Japanese tourists.<br /><br />Highly recommended for the well read.<br /><br />Amanda Richards August 20, 2004	2004-08-20

It is vastly different from \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" and \\"The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe\\", given that most of the story unfolds outside of Narnia, and it's missing the magic that permeated the first two books.<br /><br />I hasten to add here that it is a richly descriptive novel, my best description being \\"Moses\\" meets \\"The Prince and the Pauper\\" and \\"Alladin\\" in \\"Arabian Nights \\".<br /><br />Breehy-hinny-brinny-hoohy-hah, aka Bree, the horse in question does not live up to the \\"star\\" billing of the title, being a touch vain, proud and conceited and a little chicken in times of trouble, but without him there would not be a story, and Shasta (his boy, as you may have guessed)would still be a Tarkaan's slave.<br /><br />They are joined in this adventure by Aravis Tarkheena, assisted by her stable and sensible horse Hwin. Aravis is fleeing an arranged marriage to an ugly old brown-nosing Grand Vizier-designate with a humpback.<br /><br />Together they defy the odds, fight and squabble a lot, uncover a treacherous plot and finally crawl across the desert into Narnia via Archenland to help save the day.<br /><br />A grand battle ensues to satisfy the rejection issues of hot headed Tashbaan Prince Rabadash, and Queen Lucy and King Edward (of Book 2) are right in the middle of the fray.  High King Peter is off fighting somewhere else, and Queen Susan is staying out of this one, even though she more or less started it.  All our friendly mythical creatures appear at this point.<br /><br />Shasta finds his true identity, his real family, and secures his future job, and everybody lives more or less happily ever after, except Rabadash, who makes a jackass of himself.<br /><br />No story of Narnia is complete without the presence of the great and powerful Aslan, who appears in various guises throughout the story, guiding, calming, disciplining and protecting his children.<br /><br />Another compelling story for all ages.<br /><br />Amanda Richards August 7, 2004en. <br /> <br />Another compelling story for all ages. <br /> <br />Amanda Richards August 7, 2004 <br />	2004-08-08

A background check on the late great C. S. Lewis will reveal that he became a theist in 1929, a Christian in 1931, and later was awarded an honorary Doctor of Divinity by the University of St. Andrews in 1946.<br /><br /> His belief in the existence of one God, viewed as the creative source of man and the world, who transcends yet is immanent in the world, provides the foundation for the series, especially in this book and the magnificent classic &quot;The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe.&quot; (Note: definition courtesy of Merriam-Webster)<br /><br /> &quot;The Magician's Nephew&quot; tells of the creation of Narnia by the great and powerful Aslan, and the temptation of a son of Adam, by a deceiver, with an apple from a forbidden tree.<br /><br /> This is the story of Digory and Polly, two friends who, upon an accidental meeting with Magician wanna-be Uncle Andrew, find themselves in a head spinning adventure involving other worlds, magical rings, an evil sorceress, a cabby and his horse, talking animals, and a collection of fauns, satyrs, dwarves and naiads.<br /><br /> We learn about the first King and Queen of Narnia, a heroic quest, a miraculous cure, and the planting of a tree and a lamp post, both of which we will need to move on with the series.<br /><br /> Even though a slim volume, The Magician's Nephew is deceptively deep and compelling.<br /><br /> WARNING: Reading this book leads to the compulsive reading of at least six other books.<br /><br /> Amanda Richards August 1, 2004satyrs, dwarves and naiads. <br />  <br /> We learn about the first King and Queen of Narnia, a heroic quest, a miraculous cure, and the planting of a tree and a lamp post, both of which we will need to move on with the series. <br />  <br /> Even though a slim volume, The Magician's Nephew is deceptively deep and compelling. <br />  <br /> WARNING: Reading this book leads to the compulsive reading of at least six other books. <br />  <br /> Amanda Richards August 1, 2004 <br />	2004-08-01

If you had to hazard a guess at a description, you'd have to place it firmly in the comedy/ tragedy/ drama/ mystery/ romance section, or simply file it under Spark: Muriel in the Classics section.<br /><br />Narrated by the once round and central character, Agnes Hawkins (a.k.a. Mrs. Hawkins or Nancy), the story revolves around her experiences as a young widow living in furnished rooms in a semi-detached building in South Kensington.  She colorfully describes her neighbors and acquaintances, and gives us tantalizing glimpses into their little secret worlds, in which she is a trustee and confidante.<br /><br />Despite the mysterious black boxes and the lurking threat of enemies, known and unknown, our heroine manages to keep her head above water, remains a pillar of strength and finds true love among the rubble.  Thanks to her diet plan (freely given to the reader as a bonus for purchasing the book), she gains new self-respect, and reinvents herself in a new country, a far cry from her humble beginnings.<br /><br />A simple classic by an inspired writer.<br /><br />Amanda Richards	2004-07-10

What is amazing is the way he weaves so many stories into a tidy, compact little package - almost the size of a pack of cigarettes, as a matter of fact.<br />This is a story about a tarnished princess, an outlaw bomber with bad teeth, a scene stealing if somewhat undomesticated loyal servant, toads - both real and plastic, an exiled King and his \\"Oh-Oh, spaghetti-o\\" Queen, a CIA not-so-secret agent, an outraged Middle Eastern playboy, blackberries, Camels, Ralph Nader, pyramids and aliens from Argon.<br />What more could you possibly want in a book?<br />Tom Robbins has a genuine talent for words and puns, and those with active funny bones will be tickled throughout.  His casual use of words like \\"slishy\\" and phrases like \\"I have a black belt in haiku\\" abound, to be discovered with unbridled delight.<br />This is a book to be enjoyed within one lunar cycle without fear of repercussions.	2004-07-05

Having read it on the good advice of a friend, it quickly became clear that the simple, depressing and bleak cover perfectly sums up the empathy of jaded people intentionally &quot;not celebrating&quot; Christmas at a place best described as the edge of the world.<br />The first part of the book introduces you to the characters, and characters they certainly are.  Each guest has their individual demon, and hopes to use the vacation for escape and relief.  The host meanwhile, has completely lost track of his wife, who leaves the Inn at the most inopportune moment, as fast as her wobbling high heels will carry her.  The other characters provide local color, promiscuity and adultery, adding intrigue and humor to the story.<br />This is a dark and hopeless romance story, where relationships are doomed to failure. Be warned that there's no cozy happy ending amidst the supernatural twists that pop up in the story like flashes of lightning on a dark rainy night.<br />The travellers who return home are older and wiser but not gratified or satisfied.  The book closes with the enigmatic words &quot;ye all come back in the end&quot;<br />An interesting read from an outstanding author.<br />^AR	2004-06-19

It is a conveniently sized hardcover with attractive dust cover, and has excellent pictures.  It can even be used as a coffee table book.<br />With regard to the content, there are some very good ideas, but firstly, some of the items required are not easy to get, and secondly, the more complicated projects do not have enough detail in the instructions.<br />I also found that some of the projects don't look that good if you take away the fancy settings and lighting effects used for the photographs.<br />Not a bad book, but it's more for show than function	2004-01-02

The instructions are sufficiently detailed and well illustrated.<br />The downside is that it relies quite a bit on materials from craft stores, such as glass balls, foam cones, stars and balls and so on, that are not easy to come by in my part of the world.  I would have liked to have more projects that could be done with found or recycled objects.<br />The photographs however, provide the inspiration to use substitutes where possible, to try to achieve the eye catching results.	2004-01-02

(I used him as an excuse to buy the entire series)<br />This is light reading and very black humour, and you'll find yourself running through the pages quickly just to find out what dire misfortune is going to occur next.<br />The stories are all incredibly, impossibly silly and hopelessly lacking in credibility, but something about them draws you back each time.<br />You keep hoping for something good, anything good, to happen to the Baudelaires, and your hopes keep getting dashed each time.  You feel like screaming in frustration every time one of the ineffective guardians allows Count Olaf to get his hands on the children, and then you have to accept the preposterous inventions  and machinations the orphans use to get themselves out of each messy situation.<br />These books should be very popular with most young children, because they're not \\"goody goody\\" stories, about animals and fairies.  Another plus is that big words are explained as part of the story, so just maybe they'll learn something too.<br />The presentation and illustrations are very good, as is the \\"old fashioned\\" binding of the books.<br />A very nice addition to your library.
