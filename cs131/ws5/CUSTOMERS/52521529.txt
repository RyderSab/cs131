For the substance, I relied on Cliff's Notes. Later, in college, I tackled the diary in earnest, wishing that I had been more serious with it in high school.<br />Samuel Pepys would have been a member of history without his famous diary, and Tomalin's book shows us why. He was one of history's first self-made men (the sort of man whom Franklin, over 100 years later, would have approved), rising from the son of a tailor to the highest ranks of post-Restoration England. In doing so, he deftly navigates the treacherous political landscape, managing to sufficiently gloss over his republican past and ingratiate himself to Charles II. Through his careful administration of the navy, Pepys became the hero to later naval administrators. He was also a member of the Royal Society and, later, of parliament. <br />Of course, Pepys was also a scoundrel, a cheat, and shameless groper of any woman unlucky enough to be caught alone with him. Many of his exploits were captured in the diary, in which his self-fascination is rendered as disinterested, clear prose. Pepys writes about himself as a hired psychologist might write about a patient. He seems to live for more and better material for his diary; or, as Tomalin puts it, \\"Pepys the man gave Pepys the writer all the material he needed.\\" <br />Both Pepys the man and Pepys the writer are in good hands with Tomalin. She handles her subject with just the right amount of feminist disdain. She chides him for his \\"sexual assaults\\" and his overall frailties. But can there be total detachment on the part of the biographer from her subject? If anything, especially toward the end of the book, Tomalin has fallen for the very pathos she herself has created for Pepys. <br />This is a worthy biography. Anyone remotely interested in Pepys (or, for that matter, a lively and thoroughly researched history of post-Restoration England) should seek out this book.	2002-12-30

It's a hilarious narrative about life in Trinidad, during WWII. Ganesh has finished his BA in the college at Port of Spain, when he is called home to his father's funeral. Once home, he marries the daughter of a friend of his father's. Ganesh needs a profession. He tries running a small \\"institute,\\" writing, traditional Hindu massage ... he succeeds at nothing, until his aunt, \\"The Great Belcher,\\" introduces him to mysticism. As the Mystic Masseur, he becomes known throughout Trinidad. Eventually he is pulled toward politics, and thus closer to the British colonial culture that will clash with his Hindu values and eventually absorb him. <br />\\"The Mystic Masseur\\" has unforgettable characters: the-father-in-law, Ramlogan; Beharry, the \\"nibbler,\\" whose wife, Suruj Mooma, never passes up an opportunity to remind us that she \\"read to the Third Standard.\\" <br />Later in his career, Naipaul tackled the subject of colonial schizophrenia with much more somber work: books like \\"Bend in the River\\" and \\"A Way in the World\\" touch on many of the same themes as this one, but not with the priceless humor.	2002-12-23

Miguel Street is a melting pot at the ends of the British Empire, which, during WWII, is already on the ebb. Naipaul's first written and third published book tells the stories of Miguel Street's characters from the point of view of a young boy. Each of the stories are illuminating portraits of the limitations of colonial life. If you're looking for parables about poverty or racism, you won't find them here. Instead, you will find Naipaul's genius penchant for telling sad stories with great humor; and, rather than lessening the sense of the tragedy, Naipaul's humor makes it that much more impactful. Those who are also fans of Paul Theroux will recognize than the later writer used \\"Miguel Street\\" as the DNA for his \\"Hotel Honolulu.\\"	2002-12-23

Theroux's narrator is a transplanted, washed-up writer, who moves to Hawaii from London (just as did the author) to escape the literary life. He encounters a culture that is half-formed and unliterary, which the unnamed narrator, and Theroux, seems to consider both laughable and noble. These interwoven stories carve a good depiction of modern Hawaii and the expatriates who find new lives there. For those who are familiar with the author's opinions and literary travails, this book reads like an atonement; and makes for very good, and very easy, reading.	2002-10-02

After 9/11, it gained itself a whole new readership. Naipaul's first \\"Islam\\" book is a collection of opinions about the effect of Islam on what he calls the \\"converted\\" (non-Arab)peoples ... the Iranians, who woke up from history with the new knowledge of an surrounding infidel civilization, one that could not be dominated and so instead was to be rejected ... rejected, and depended upon, the Pakistanis, who threw out the rule of law that they inherited from their former British administrators and replaced it with nothing. This book also concerns itself with the Malay cultures of Malaysia and Indonesians, whom Naipaul seems to both admire and disdain. The admiration stems from their post-war economic achievements (which he attributes to their Chinese minorities); the distain stems from the short-sightedness of their \\"New Islam\\" leanings, and their iconoclastic reaction to their pre-Islamic history (which he seems to respect more than Islam ... no surprise, since they were Hindu cultures). As always, Naipaul uses the stories of ordinary people to prove what he considers Islam's cultural destructiveness, a sort of colonization no better or worse that the Western form that he experienced in his boyhood Trinidad. <br />That said, this is a great book, full of the clear-eyed truths for which Naipaul is so well known. But, as with this book's sequel, \\"Among the Believers,\\" it has to be taken with a grain a salt: Naipaul, as a Brahmin, deeply resents the affect of Islam of his marble model of ancient India. But his assessments will resonant very clearly with those who approach the subject of Islam, especially \\"New Islam,\\" with an open mind.	2002-10-02

Theroux claims it is a book of fiction, and perhaps it is. But the main character's name is Paul Theroux, and his experiences and titled output very much resemble the author's. From Cape Cod, where Theroux recounts a boyhood relationship with a secretly extraordinary uncle, to East Africa, where he teaches English to lepers, to Singapore and poetry lessons for a talentless war merchant, to London, where his career and ambition begin to soar, and then back again to Massachusetts, where his doldrums bring him into the orbit of both strangers and old friends. How closely does this narrative follow Theroux's actually life events? Who knows? Maybe VS Naipaul does.	2002-08-28

However, when he was through with these three journalistic essays, he found himself with the material (and treatments) for two. <br />The first essay is the story of Michael X, the half-Portuguese black power man from Trinidad. Naipaul writes frankly about this very complex but ultimately pathetic man. The essay became the kernel for \\"Guerillas,\\" where the details of Michael X's story, right down to the literary ambitions and the murders, became good fiction.<br />The second essay is Naipaul's very harsh look at Argentina. South America is a mystery to most North Americans, and Naipaul takes pains to highlight what he considers its lesser history. The reader is left with the sense of a society that never really stopped the foolish quest for El Dorado; one with all the of the guilt of the North American societies (Indian genocides, shameless land grabs) but none of the redeeming triumphs. Particularly astute are his descriptions of Buenos Aires, which he describes as a half-city. Despite this essay's (and the book's) title, there is very little about Eva Peron. Madonna tells that story better than Naipaul.<br />The last full-length essay is a profile of Zaire, the former Belgian Congo (now known again as the Congo). In reading this essay you will understand why many people believe Naipaul is little more than a sunburned racist. His knack for zeroing in on the pathetic aspects of societies just finding their way is sometimes overdone and in bad taste. But it is honest. I felt guilty, laughing at his anecdotes of this troubled region and its people. Naipaul could learn a thing or two from Nick Carraway, the narrator of Fitzgerald's \\"The Great Gatsby\\" ... 'Whenever you feel like criticizing any one, just remember that all the people in this word haven't had all the advantages that you've had.' It's a very simple quote, and Naipaul should take it to heart. In any event, this book became the treatment for \\"Bend in the River,\\" and people familiar with that book will find that much of its fiction is actually fact.<BR> <BR>The last essay is a word about Conrad, whom Naipaul only barely praises. After so much literary comparison, I supposed Naipaul felt obligated to write a bit of criticism. It's a postscript, and very forgettable.	2002-08-11

The narrator of this book reminds the reader of many of Graham's other characters: An upper-crust Englishman abroad -- Fowler, the Saigon-based journalist, whose friendship with Pyle, the American embassy's 'Economic AttachÃ©' becomes the tool that moves the narrative along. Parts of Graham's book, especially the sections describing the fighting between the Viet Mihn and the French, read like journalism. But most of its greatness (this is a great novel) can be attributed to Greene's masterful hand in describing the narrator's mixed feelings for Pyle, an ostensibly wholesome Harvard-brow, whose intentions are good but whose methods and assumptions are based on pure American naivety. These feelings grow more complex when the narrator's Vietnamese girlfriend warms to Pyle -- the obvious metaphor for the relative decline of British colonial power to American dynamism. Writing about these metaphors may seem cheesy, since most writers come off as cheesy when they attempt them. But Graham Greene is so skilled, and so subtle, that the little human personifications of his big ideas come off flawlessly.	2002-08-10

In the first years of post-war Japan, a time of mind-bending social change in Japan, the narrator is hoping to marry off one of his daughters - but there are difficulties that he is hard-pressed to explain. In the book's early pages (flashbacks to the prewar days) the narrator is the picture of the success: He is an artist, someone who has made a reputation creating posters and other propaganda pieces for the Imperial Japanese government. This history slowly comes to light in the narrative. The theme of the novel, and the force that propels the plot, is the narrator's reckoning.<br />Like most Ishiguro books, this book is written in the first person personal, with an unreliable narrator: It is Ishiguro's very own form, and a winning way to write a novel. Those who have read \\"The Remains of the Day\\" will recognize it. <br />I think that is one of the best novels that I've ever read.	2002-08-10

Now he is branching out and proving himself a worthy successor, if not to Conrad and Naipaul, to the Robert Kaplan's and Paul Theroux's of the world. This book essentially starts with the author's self-dare: What's the most dangerous, outlandish journey I could possibly make? How about a trip of the blood vein of the world's most dangerous and unstable region, Central Africa? This self-discussion is accounted for in the book, and it gives the book a buccaneer quality. But this is a real and honest account of what's really going on in Africa (namely in the waning days of Mobuto's Zaire, now known again as Conrad and the Belgians knew it, The Congo). It is sad to see a just how much as nation has degenerated in the 30 years since the end of colonization. But it is refreshing to see a young author treat the subject so honestly.	2002-08-10

The history of the ensuing friendship is the bedrock of this curious memoir. <br />In many ways \\"Sir Vidia's Shadow\\" is typical Theroux: Although there are the many (and well-publicized) jabs at \\"Sir Vidia,\\" Mr. Theroux comes off as hardheaded and difficult as he does in his other books. Naipaul, of course, comes off far worse. Monomaniacal, misogynistic, racist, cheap, mean, unbearably arrogant and annoying pretentious, with his old Oxford archaisms and his \\"Nye-Powell\\" Anglicization, Sir Vidia seems to be the man we always feared he was. Theroux, in fact, seems to be his only friend. Likewise, Naipaul appears to be among the author's few friends - which is the book's saddest aspect. For those who've read and enjoyed the work of both men, who've recognized how each came to affect the eye and writing of the other, it's a shame to witness egos tearing apart such an interesting literary relationship. (Theroux blames the split on Naipaul and his new wife, the insufferable Pakistani half-wit, Naira. As is often the case, the truth is less complex: Pure ego was the culpit.)<br />A few of the Theroux's points harm his premise: He chides Naipaul for literary vainglory: \\"This sort of book has never been done before. This is a new form;\\" and yet Theroux himself states that a memoir like \\"Sir Vidia's Shadow\\" has never been done. Further, he claims Naipaul's recent writing is silly and unreadable. Naipaul has never published anything silly or unreadable. Theroux also hints that he's achieved a sort of literary parity with Naipaul. He hasn't. As good as Theroux is, VS Naipaul is the finer writer; Naipaul has the bigger and better expressed ideas; and Theroux benefited more from knowing Sir Vidia than the other way around. <br />But the book is fascinating, funny and well done.	2002-07-25

After a string of mishaps and missteps, among them, marrying a \\"backwards\\" (the Indian untouchable caste) girl, the narrator turns up in London for college. This is where the novel truly begins ... on page 49 in a book that's only just over 200 pages long. Indeed, this is a book in 3rds: The Indian prologue, the time Willie spends in London and the people he meets there, and then his time in the \\"African\\" country - another of Naipaul's venerable themes. This is a book in 3rds, in which most of Naipaul's going concerns - his obsession with India, the mimicry, schizophrenia and pathos of colonial people in London, and the plight of the newly-independent nations, especially African nations - receive equal billing. <br />Paul Theroux called it \\"certainly Naipaul's slightest work, and definitely the weirdest.\\" There is some truth to this; but it's also a great point of departure for anyone interested in Naipaul. What's more, for those who don't have time to tackle his cannon, it is a workable survey of the big themes which won him the Nobel.	2002-07-21

Most foreign writers, from Dickens to Camus, have visited the US and come away with nothing good to say. It become a rote right of passage for Nobel-bound authors to visit the US, find it lumpen and lame, and then bring out a margin travel book about the experience.<br />There is none of this Naipaul's book, which, true to the title, is concerned with the Southern states. Anyone familiar with Naipaul's other travel works will recognize the form: This is not a book about the writer in a strange place; this is a book of stories about people and their experiences with home. Naipaul meets lay preachers and famous writers (Eudora Welty) and bible-thumping Southern politicans. He meets the self-described, proud \\"rednecks\\" (who fascinate him: Only a foreigner, and perhaps only VS Naipaul, could beautify these people, and in them find a sort of culture and heroic resistance in their Cat hats and beer guts). Race, religion and the tragic Southern history are the dominant themes of this book. If you read it, you will come away with a new sense of Southern history and Southern people.

Naipaul's topic runs close to the grain of the uncomfortable topics that sometimes lead to accusations of racism, a label that Naipaul has suffered. If he appears to be without sympathy for the state of many post-colonial societies (especially post-colonial African societies), he has great sympathy for the individuals in those places, not just those who were colonized, but those who did the colonizing too. The comic aspects of Naipaul's writing (of which there is precious little in \\"A Bend of the River\\") belie the deep rift that is the legacy of European colonization.	2002-06-26
US	52521529	RKIKFSXEALRBM	0679640991	357701822	The Best and the Brightest	Books	5	33	34	N	N	Required Reading	Halberstam's book's most illuminating quote is attributed to one of Walt Rostow's (the chief architect of the US bombing of North Vietnam) Harvard colleagues. After his friend departed Cambridge, to take up his position the Kennedy administration, this colleague walked into a roomful of students, and said, more or less, \\"you never sleep as well at night when you actually know people running the country.\\"<br />This book is all about the men (the best and the brightest) who mired this nation in Vietnam. It's also about other men, men like John Peyton Davies, perhaps the State Department's best Asian expert, purged from public service after the McCarthy juggernaut swept through the country. It's also about applying the wrong lessons of history to wrong problems: Kennedy and Johnson learned from Munich that nations shrink from \\"tyranny\\" at their own peril, and therefore decided to confront the \\"tyranny\\" of North Vietnam communism, which, according to Halberstam, was simply nationalism -- the extension of their colonial wars of the 1950s. Men like Davies would have realized this, and then warned against intervention; but men like Davies, ostensibly \\"soft\\" on communism, had already been run out of Washington (during the Vietnam War, Davies, the man Halberstam uses to personify the flight of those who really understood the intentions of North Vietnam, was making furniture in Peru). Men like McNamara, the Bundys, and Dean Rusk, despite their rationalism and considerable mental horsepower, didn't get this. Nor did they understand how to bring themselves (and the country) back once they'd stepped beyond the brink.<br />For all its quality and insight, the book makes a little much of the \\"establishment\\" credentials of the war's architects. It's as if Halberstam believes that, since these men came from storied Atlantic families, they were somehow doomed to err. It's likely that these credentials made these men arrogant; but I also believe that an administration filled with menself-made men, men who'd never known any family privilege, might easily have made the same mistakes as the McGeorge Bundys of the world. <br />Still, this is a remarkable book. A side note: I think this book should be required reading for the business executives of today. This is where today's best and brightest operate, and they are capable of making the same sorts of mistakes. Look at the executives of Enron and WorldCom: Just like the men of the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, they're capable of believing in their own infallibility just because everyone around them says it's so.	2002-06-26

There is great historical information in the book, and a reader gets a feel for why it is that today's Muslim societies -- especially the Arab societies -- cannot stand their current predicament. These people are used to being on top, and they're searching for what went wrong. Lewis blames history, and bad decision-making. The Ottomans, one of this arguments goes, considered the West to be so inferior, they didn't even have permanent embassies in infidel cities. Because of such thinking, the subtleties of the diplomacy, statecraft, etc., are trades they're still learning. Lewis also points out that Western seafaring, and the new trade routes to Asia it opened, really hurt the Middle East, since its principalities could no longer generate revenue from traders along the Silk Road. This represents another interesting and fresh point.	2002-05-05

You can see that sentiment from these reviews. I loved this book and was hooked from in first 5 or so pages. I've read most of McEwan's novels, and this one reads like many of them. This novel won the Booker Prize, and it deserved to win it. But that's just my opinion.	2002-03-09

He will, in the course of ten or so pages, detail the events of recent history on the person he's profiling. Or he will go back into the distant past, and recount how historical events affected the person's ancestors. As always with Naipaul, there is the sense of a lost history; and he contends that Islam, which demands (and, in Arabic, means) submission, is history's greatest colonizing force. Upon conversion, an individual's history, sacred places, language ... everything, is Arab-ized. Naipaul believes that this leads to a sort of cultural schizophrenia. He uses the story of a schizophrenic Malaysian man as a metaphor for this cultural confusion.<br />There may be truth in Naipaul's assessments. But remember that this is a man who is bitter about the Mogul invasions of India (despite being from Trinidad). Naipaul, like all of us, brings his own baggage to an issue.<br />Still, this is a really good and relevent read.	2002-03-09

There is not a region or conflict about which he does not have an opinion; and although his assesments leave the reader wanting more, they make for interesting reading. He points out diplomatic realities that few Americans would ever consider: For instance, that it makes sense for the US to maintain a divided Korea, or that there is no more natural ally of the US than Iran. Although these statement may seem counter-intuitive, Kissinger explains his reasoning thoughtfully, and in clear prose.	2002-02-28

If you've only read his travel works, it may come as a surprise that Kaplan is in fact the dean of the American neo-conservative movement. Kaplan's world view is one where the end game of western international efforts must be to preserve our institutions, rather than force them on others. Even if you disagree with him, this is a compelling and interesting book.	2002-02-28

If you're familiar with Naipaul, you will notice that it is in this book that he begins to shed the comicalness that marks his earlier works.	2002-02-28

It is also perhaps Naipaul's most autobiographical, and brazenly so. There is no attempt on the part of the narrator (whom Naipaul uses, first to explain how the colonial baggage affects his characters [characters, incidentally, whom you've met in other Naipaul novels], and then to represent the brainchild of a number of \\"unwritten\\" stories told in \\"A Way in the World's\\" pages) to distance himself from Naipaul's own experiences in Trinidad, England, and then all over the world, as the \\"voice\\" of the former colonials. This weight of this book's message comes late, making a challenging read worthwhile.	2002-01-25

This fact is easily gleaned from him interviews, his childishness re: Naipaul and his writing. It's pretty difficult to spend hours reading the work of a man who seems to hate everything. Still, if you spend enough time with this writer you will begin to see that his cynicism is a real reaction to much of what he sees on his travels. A lot of his anecdotes are tiring (The irritating American tourists ... yawn. The unsmiling Russians ... stretch.), but I think that Paul Theroux is honest about the things he sees in the world. I think most American travelers are either too abrasive or too accommodating, flogging themselves in order to appear worldlier. I don't know which is more irritating. Theroux engages in none of this. One of the surprising things about reading this writer (perhaps he and his agent schemed this up) is how refreshing it is when he sees something he actually likes and/or admires. There's a touching section in this book about the decency of a class of night school students he instructs. He also mentions having a soft spot for people he sees reading books. A piece of advice: If you ever meet Paul Theroux, feign that you're reading. And one more thing: The guy can flat out write.	2002-01-05

Contrary to the billing, this is not a travel book (although it could pass for one): This is a book and the foolishness of misplaced priorities and the danger of modern ethnic divisions.<br />If the book had been written later, Kaplan would surely have focused more heavily on Serbia and Bosnia. In this book, however, the most ink goes to Greece. I would like Kaplan to write an entire book on the subject...	2002-01-05

One of the things that floored me about Lincoln was his humble background. We've all heard about the log cabin ... the truth is even more amazing. Don't look to this book for mid-19th century America history. Don't look to it for a Civil War narrative. This book is about the decisions Lincoln made, and what he knew when he made them. I wish Donald focused more on Mary Todd Lincoln. In over 700 pages, we hardly hear a peep out of her.	2001-11-16

This is truly one on the least understood places on earth, and certainly one of the grimmest. Gourevitch, who distinguished himself on the Rwandan issue in the pages of &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;, uses a series of powerful stories (some are more like anecdotes) to bring a human sense to something so inhuman: 1.2 million people killed (most with machetes) in just over eight weeks. Don't look for any solace in this book. If you read it, you will lose sleep. You will also be a lot smarter about something that we should all know more about.	2001-11-16

It should fool no one that Grant's memoirs, written under financial pressure, and completed only days before throat cancer killed him, have become part of the American canon. If you've ever seen those upright potraits of this man, his frill-less diction and clarity will not surprise. Despite hailing from another time, this is a remarkably quick read.	2001-11-16

Nevertheless, she welds together a series of events that have convinced some in our government (among them, the hawkish Paul Wolfewitz and Donald Rumsfeld) that the 1993 WTC bombing - despite being executed by halfwits (read: the genius who attempted to collect his deposit from the truck rental company after he'd just detonated it under the WTC) - was actually planned by Iraqi intelligence. If she's correct, this nation faces a huge problem: In her book, we learn of the networks that have been ignored for too long, and about just what they have in store the United States. One hopes that she's wrong; but if she isn't, Sept. 11 is a wake up call from which we shrink at out own peril.	2001-11-16

His very best was Artist of the Floating World, followed by Remains of the Day. This book follows the career of a Shangai-raised Englishmen who becomes a detective. Like all Ishiguro's book, the narrarator has exagerated sense of formality. The sense of denial and the sort of \\"elephant in the middle of the room\\" truths that lead to great ending in Ishiguro's other books never materialize in this one.	2001-11-16

So said Adams, shortly before his July 4th death, upon being asked if he wished to elaberate on his wishes for Americans on Independence Day. Instead, he left it as \\"Liberty forever!\\" In reading this account in McCullough's new biography of Adams, you want to reach through the years and shake his hand.  I read McCullough's biography of Truman, mainly because, for a best-selling biographer, his choice of subjects was so brave. For a biographer to dedicate effort to raising the historical capital of a man who graduated from public life in such low stead is a brave thing, indeed. The same can be said for his new profile of John Adams. With his stature, McCullough could have written another Jefferson bio and received the same adoration. Instead, he boldly selected Adams. It is Adams, of all the Founding Fathers, about whom we knew the least. We knew that he was from Mass., we knew that he was the 2nd President and that his son was the 6th, but somehow details about the man never became part of the national curriculum. But rest assured, in his trademark, eminently readable and delightful way, McCullough will fill you in on the details.	2001-07-10

First, a gripe: The ...staffer who reviewed this book apparently didn't give it a thorough read. The main character was raised in Hamburg, not Vienna. What's more, she claims that <i>For Kings and Planets</i> was Canin&#8217;s first novel. Not so ... <i>Blue River</i> was. Not a big deal, but sort of like nails on the blackboard.  <br /><br /> In any event, aside from its looseness with the facts, ...review of this book is solid. Especially astute is the reviewer's point that it reads like a competently woven series of short stories. Read it. You will dig it.	2001-07-10
