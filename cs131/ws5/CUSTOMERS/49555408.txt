It seems a lot of people was quite disappointed by \\"Resurrection\\", the six and last vol. of the War of the Spider Queen series. <br /> <br />I, for one, wasn't. Becuase the ending, and what Lolth said herself exemplify what we should expect from the Spider Queen to begin with. <br /> <br />She is Chaos personified. Chaos HAS no purpose, no reason. It is what it is and that is enough, and what she had done: drawing the Demonweb out of the Abyss, renewing herself by devouring her yor'thae, the subsequent destruction and routing of her worshippers and cities, just simply the result from the glory of Chaos, of her very nature.  <br /> <br />The ultimate irony is that most readers probably felt like Quenthel toward the end of the book. But some, like me, who know what to expect from one such as Lolth, practically shiver with delight to know that all this grief and destruction was simply just a spur of the moment whim of a capricicious demon goddess. <br /> <br />That in itself is enough. <br /> <br />	2005-08-22

You might be questioning yourself after reading this tedious book.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the movie \\"The Towering Inferno\\", which was based on two novels, The Glass Inferno and The Tower, there is only one book you can read to see where the blockbuster disaster flick got most of its material: The Glass Inferno.<br /><br />With all due respect, The Tower is quite a boring book. A 125th story building went up in blaze because of some disgruntled employee. The rest of the book is basically a race against time to get the people on the top floors out. But however, somehow I didn't feel there was an urgency in getting the people out because Stern tend to focus more on the subplot of figuring the cause of the blaze. It got to the point where I said: What happened to the fire? I thought we had a building burning in here somewhere!<br /><br />In all, the movie resemble more on the Glass Inferno. The only things unique to the Tower which the movie retained was several characters: Susan Blakely's Patty Simmons and her wayward husband. Her father (who already had a counterpart in Wyndom Leroux of the Glass Inferno, in a way, Patty's counterpart in Glass Inferno was Thelma Leroux) who dropped from a heart attack after hearing his son in law was fooling around with the architect's wife, the Ramsays and the politicans. Oh yes, also the breeches buoy.<br /><br />Speaking of that, there was a scene where some girl got drunk and took off her clothes and rode the breeches buoy in nothing but high heels [...].<br /><br />Well, we are not talking about Shakespeare....but when you have something as gratuitous as that, it looked as if the author was desperately trying to liven up what was turning out to be a dull story.<br /><br />And The Tower was quite dull.	2004-12-24

Salvatore's War of the Spider Queen, Book 4)	Books	4	5	6	N	Y	Quenthel and her scourge steals the show	Lisa Smedsmen wrote part four of this six part series dealing with a band of elite drow searching for the whereabouts of their patroness, Lolth, the Demon Queen of Spiders. <br /> <br />In the previous book, Condemnation, the band reached the very realm of Lolth herself, because of the actions of a treacherous priest of Vhaeraun, the Drow was forced an early exit from the Demonweb Pits. In Extinction, the band of Drow champions decided to return to the Abyssal layer. To get there, they returned to the Underdark and have to deal with the repulsive aquatic aberrations called the aboleths in the hopes of finding the whereabouts of a Ship of Chaos. With the ship in tow, they will return to the Abyss. Meanwhile one of their numbers, Halisstra, has lost all her faith in the Spider Queen and is on a path that leads to the goddess Eilistraee, whereas Quenthel herself is beginning to express doubt. <br /> <br />What I like about Lisa Smedsmen's style is that she truly captured the underlying deceit and contempt the Drow has for each other...especially between Quenthel and Pharaun. She also put a new and compelling twist that the previous writers didn't really focus on....Quenthel and her five headed scourge. In previous books, they just hissed warnings to Quenthel, here, she carried on full telepathic conversations with them....each of the heads turn out to be as devious and sadistic as their mistress. One can only wonder if Quenthel is not shcizophrenic and these voices are really coming from inside her head and not the snakes.....Just a theory. <br /> <br />One thing that Smedsmen and the other authors still hasn't been able to adequately protray with a fresh twist was the half-demons Aliisza and Kaanyr Vhok. For some reasons, these two remain two dimensional cardboard cutouts. Kaanyr spent most of his time standing around in his armor scowling about how his plans are going while Aliisza spent her time alternating between spying on Pharuan and trying to attract Kaanyr's attention. The conversations between the two of them remain predictable and monotonous. In fact, the pair are pretty annoying. <br /> <br />Despite not much really happened or progressed in the Drows' quest for Lolth in Extinction, but Lisa Smedsmen do managed to make it a worthwhile read. <br />	2004-11-08

To set the record straight, the very first Alien movie will always be regarded as a classic instead of blatant imitators like Predator. Whereas Predator looked and feel blatantly 1980s, Alien still look like it could have been shot a year ago. Alien set the blueprint and the standards for the film of the genre, which none, in my opinion,has surpassed, much less equaled. It is a film that you watch with repeated viewing and learn to appreciate its complexity whereas its imitators (and unfortunately, sequels) relied on cheap thrills, gore, and caters to those with the attention span of a gnat. Granted, I enjoy shoot em up non stop action. Just don't compare these films to Alien as an equal. It is easier to film a shoot 'em up than to film a movie that manipulate the audience's imagination and senses.    Now, onto the book. Alan Dean Foster's novelization, compared to the film, is a bit of a let down...espcially when the film relied on stunning (and spooky) set designs. Reading the book you don't seem to get the impression that the alien is this phallic-headed double jawed skeletal monstrosity. In fact, the alien is barely described at all.    The novel is more sci-fi and less horror, and it is based on previous screenplays of films, many of the elements (and dialouge) of which was discarded in the film. Because it is not based on what was shot but what WAS written, the novel differs from the film in various key points: the attack scene of Parker and Lambert was kind of bland and straightforward, Ripley never even found her compatriot's bodies. She just realized she was the last survivor and tore butt out of there. The scene with the alien in the airlock (which was never filmed) was retained, and so was the cocoon sequence and Lambert and Ripley's altercation. All of the character retain their basic personality...with the exception of Lambert. In the film, she and Ripley were polar opposites, in the book, there was really no differentiation between the two women...she wasn't teary or hysterical.    In all, the novelization of Alien kind of dull the film. The illustrated version, if you can find it, is more accurate...and it showed how Brett was REALLY killed in the film before the Ridley Scott went editing crazy.	2004-11-05

Finally, a bio on Jennifer Jones!<br />I remember the very first time I ever laid eyes on Jennifer Jones. I was probably around 8 or 9 years old and it was the NBC broadcast premiere of The Towering Inferno. I started watching it in mid film and saw this white claded woman running through a smoke filled hallway and banging on the door.<br />Needless to say, Jones was one of the few people who actually acted in the disaster epic and I was a Jennifer Jones fan from that day on.<br />Portrait of Jennifer is a biography on Jennifer Jones, the only other bio I know of is called Star Crossed, a book on Jones and her erstwhile husband Robert Walker. But this book concentrates solely on Ms Jones herself. This is a shame. It seems of all of the stars of yesteryear, Jennifer Jones is often the most overlooked and ignored. When the New York Rockette had their first Black performer, also named Jennifer Jones, nobody made the connection. It is a shame, but this book remedied that and gave Jennifer Jones the recognition she deserves in writing.<br />The author originally contacted Jennifer Jones for her participation in the book, which the former actress respectfully declined. Thus the book is mostly from hearsay and second hand accounts....but however, the author still managed to paint a fascinating portrait of the actress.<br />Born Phylis Isley, the book traced Jones' vaudeville childhood, to her marriage to Robert Walker. She was then discovered by David O. Selznick, which lead to her Oscar winning performance in The Song of Bernadette. She and Robert Walker became the star couple in Hollywood...which ended with her marriage to Selznick and her divorce from Robert Walker. Robert Walker's life was pratically destroyed after Jennifer divorced him and ironically, it seems Jennifer's promising film career was stunted (albeit unintentionally) by Selznick, who was so obsessed with her that he limited her roles mostly to romantic leads.<br />The bio also went onto Selznick's death, Jones' suicide attempts, her marriage to her Norton Simon, and a comeback to the movies which was aborted with the tragic suicide of her daughter.<br />There are also some background info on her various movies, and fans of \\"The Towering Inferno\\" may be interested in some tidbits in the book, such as Jones provided the material for the gown she wore in the film (white silk that costed around a hundred bucks a yard...and I am talking about 1970 dollars!).<br />In any case, after reading the book, Jennifer Jones came across as most of her onscreen roles: a seemingly timid and frail woman who possesses a high degree of strength and independence.<br />I hope that she realize she still has fans out there, and I wouldn't mind seeing her in a movie again.	2004-06-26

David Strah's \\"Gay Dads\\" offers an insightful look into something that straight couples....and to some extend, Lesbian couples, often take for granted....the ability and option to bear and raise children. The term \\"Gay Dad\\", once seems to be an oxymoron, even within the Gay community itself; but the book spotlights a changing attitude among gay men toward fatherhood. It is something that IS possible, and should be embraced.<br />Strah profiled two dozen examples of gay men being father, many of which involves couples, with notable exceptions, like the gripping chapter \\"Safely Home\\". Strah (along with Susanna Margolis)detailed the problems these men faced in trying to be fathers. Each is a epic quest in itself, filled with Herculean obstacles.<br />The first obstacle is biologically and patently obvious; men can't get pregnant, and in real life, not all Wills have their Graces. This leads to many of the men in the book to adopt children, often outside of their own race. The biological barrier pales when compared to the second obstacle: being gay; which opens a Pandora's Box filled with cans of worms.<br />If \\"normal\\" straight couples are having a hard time adopting children, imagine what it is for a gay male couple. The book reveals that the process of adoption IS a bed of roses, complete with the thorns.<br />Even in the 20th century, attitudes toward men, particularly gay men, raising babies are enough to give adoption agencies and social workers pause, and not all women are willing to have their babies adopted by gay men, much less the babies' biological fathers.<br />The third obstacle, which would be interesting to see 15 years down the road, is how will the children react when they are old enough to realize their parents are not \\"normal\\"? This is a situation not helped when some of the kids are biracial and/or of a different ethnic background from their fathers. How will the world react to them and what bigotry and prejudices they will face along the way?<br />All the men Strah profiled related their own personal experiences in going through all these barriers. Strah saved the last chapter for himself and his partner. Upon reading them, a common theme ran through the book. If given enough courage, perseverance, persistence and conviction, anything is possible.<br />I recommend everyone, straight, gay, black, white, whatever, to read this book. It might be about Gay Dads but its themes of love, tolerance and understanding is universal and applies to everybody.<br />Those who are more close-minded will probably think this is a work of propaganda to promote the \\"gay agenda\\" by detailing only the good and ignoring the bad. Well, surprise!....Not all the profiles have hunky dory happy endings.<br />Overall it is an enlightening book, many of the people in it has taken steps in their lives which I can only dream about. The only gripe I have is that in trying to be as inclusive as possible of all the situations and scenarios, the chapters were rather short. Some stories are really full-blown biographies simply waiting to be explored into deeper details. Hey, who can't say the men who were profiled wouldn't go on to write their own books?<br />Ultimately, Gay Dads proves that unconditional love transcends race, gender, religion, and yes, even sexual orientation. Of course, the Sean Hannitys and Michael Savages of the world would disagree. But just see the black and white photos of the dads and their children. Look into the infinite joy and innocence in those eyes and faces. Isn't that what REALLY matters?	2003-07-03

They were an elder chinese man and his grown daughter Chi Che. Chi Che went missing one day and in an effort to track her down, Nancy (the redhead) and her two constant companions Bess (the blonde) and George (the brunette) stumbled upon a smuggling ring. The action eventually took them to Hong Kong....not before someone threw a flowerpot at Nancy, Bess was abducted, Aunt Heloise' oven exploded, and George have to undergo Oriental drag. And oh yes....Nancy's hot beau Ned Nickerson is revealed to be able to speak Chinese. How convenient.<br />Overall, this is one of the better Nancy Drew mysteries... considering that this book was written in the 1950s/60s, its depiction of its Asian characters are surprisingly non stereotypical; none of them acted like buffoons or know karate. Which is very refreshing.	2002-05-20

When Warner Bros and 20th Century Fox decided to make their own high rise disaster pic, one picked \\"The Tower\\" and the other \\"The Glass Inferno\\"; they realized they each will be making similar movies. So in a rare instance of common sense, the two studio combined resources and churned out \\"The Towering Inferno\\". Despite having the movie based on the two novels, the end result resemble more on \\"The Glass Inferno\\" rather than \\"The Tower.\\" In fact, the only thing the movie retain from \\"The Tower\\" was the breeches bouy and several characters, some of which have their own counterparts in \\"The Glass Inferno\\".<br />If you have seen \\"The Towering Inferno\\", then you will know what the novel is about. Of course, the novel doesn't have the stupid insipid dialogue the movie was saddled with. And \\"The Glass Infnero\\" ends on a brighter note that the movie.<br />As a point of interest, the building is known as the \\"Glass Tower\\", 66 stories high and equipped with a scenic elevator and a promenade room. And Jennifer Jones' character, Lisolette Mueller, who \\"enjoyed\\" a spectacular death scene in the movie, survived in the novel in her own spectacular way (she climbed down the blown stariwell BY HERSELF without help and with a kid on her back).<br />Overall, the book is good, espcially how chapters are devoted to the fire itself; describing it as \\"the beast\\", and chronicling it from its \\"birth\\" with a cotton string as its umbilical cord, and to its death....as if the fire was a living entity in itself.	2002-04-22
US	49555408	R3FCETZ5JQZ9IJ	0971438005	206222016	Armies of the Abyss: Book of Fiends, Vol. 2 (d20 System)	Books	3	12	15	N	Y	Weak follow up to Legions of Hell	Upon first glance at the long awaited and delayed \\"Armies of the Abyss\\", one get the impression that its predecessor, \\"Legions of Hell\\" has done Green Ronin rather well monentarily.<br />Unlike \\"Legion\\", this book on demons has a glossy cover, and instead of staples, it has a spine!<br />Written by Erik Mona (with contributions from \\"Legion\\"'s author Chris Pramas), whose work I have also seen on the Internet, Armies of the Abyss details the various demons for the D&D 3e game.<br />The cover featured what I assume is a balor (Type VI demon for first edition die hards). But ultimately, this book is like opening a box of chocolates and found sawdust inside.<br />The first chapter is \\"Into the Abyss\\". Unlike \\"Legions of Hell\\" where it goes straight to business and tell you what Hell is about, this tome started out with some theological drivel. After that false start, we are introduced to a brief history of the Abyss and how a race of demons, call the tanar'ri, rise up to become the most numerous and varied inhabitants of the foul plane.<br />It then goes into about Demon lords and princes and how they gain control of a layer, and introduced a layer called \\"The Howling Threshold\\" where the chaotic evil dead goes to.<br />Chapter two detailed a class called the Thaumaturge, a character who consort with demons, but it came with a price, from physical corruptions to vile rituals which must be enacted to maintain their powers.<br />The Third chapter details some of the demon princes who rule the Abyss. No stats are given, just their appearances, their area of concern, the name of their layer(s), and their domains. Erik Mona did his research on these demons, since the majority of them are mythiclogical correct, but I would much rather he detailed more of the demons listed in the second edition of Monster Manual II instead of dumb demon princes like Ipos (a demon prince concerns with actors and comedians(!)), Marbas, the lord of fetid change, Sabnach, a rat-like prince of citywalls (oh please!), Seere, Eligor, Haagenti, Raum...the list goes on. Then there is Vepar, a thinly disguised Dagon (which unfortunately was converted into a devil in Legions of Hell). The majority of these lords take the form of humans. Not much imagination here. As far as I am concern, demon lords should not be concerning with things like actors and city walls. They should be concern about building their armies, crushing their demonic rivals and be ruler of the Abyss.<br />A page is also devoted to the demons we are all familiar with from the D&D game, some under different names like Arachnadia (Lolth), Vaz'zht (Graz'zt), Zhar'Ur-Luur (Fraz-Urb'luu), Yughooragh (Yeenoghu). Strangely, Zuggtmoy was left out.<br />After the disappointing chapter on some non-descript and lame demon princes, we are treated to the various demons of the Abyss. That chapter got off on the wrong start when the first creature describe is an alastor.<br />No problem, except that Alastor has already been well established as a pit fiend devil who serve Asmodeus as executioner...not a race of demons.<br />The next one is Alrune (plural Alrunes) and Alrunes has also been described as a unique demon princess. The came the armageddon beast, and seven head and ten horned monstrosity right out of the Book of Revelations. Then came various demons, some of which are demon lords (unique demons not quite on par with the princes).<br />The book finally wrap up with new domains and spells for the thaumaturge class.<br />Overall, it is a nice book, but pales in comparison to Legions of Hells. While the cosmology of Hell in Legions of Hell is closely based on the one in the D&D game; this doesn't seem to be the case with Armies of the Abyss. Intro of the layer known as The Howling Theshold already tells us that the Abyss we all known and love is different. <br />Also another thing which characterizes the Abyss that is not given enough detail but mentioned only in passing is that the reason why demons doesn't overrun the multiverse is they are too busy fighting each other and each demon prince is convinced only he or she is capable of ruling the entire Abyss. In Mona's vision, the demons are too busy harvesting souls from the Prime rather than eating each other (there's got to be a lot of chaotic evil mortals to support all these demon princes!).<br />Oh yes, a new race of demons, called the qlippoth is introduced. But otherwise, the selection of new demons here is paltry compare to the vast legions of the Hells.<br />No doubt a second volume will emerge detailing the foul inhabitants of the Abyss.... and we will get to know classic demon lords that are mentioned but not detailed like Aseroth, Cabiri, Barbu, Aldinach, Ereshkigal, Soneillon, Gresil, Ahrimanes, Ansitif; instead of the lame selection we have here.<br />Armies of the Abyss, overall, is a little disappointing.	2002-04-20

That is what you'd probably feel after reading this tell all bio on the one and only Queen of the Palace, Leona Helmsley.<br />The book documented in fascinating details on Leona's life. Leona was born Leona Rosenthal. If would be hard to believe now, but as a young woman, Leona was extraordinarily beautiful, as documented by the photos inserts which accompanied the book. Although she wasn't born rich, she WAS born with a fierce ambition which propelled her into being a successful career woman in real estate during a time when most women are secretaries, teachers or nurses.<br />Being in the real estate business, she soon crossed path with Harry Helmsley, then married to his first wife Eve. A seperate chapter is dedicated to Harry and how he build his real estate empire.<br />Ruthless and conniving Leona convinced Harry to separate from Eve and married her. Before her marriage to Helmsley, Leona was a competitive and cutthroat woman. Now with an empire at her fingertips, her pettiness and insensitivity reaches heights higher than the Empire State Building. The book is chock full of her frequent outbursts at her employees, associates, family, and acquaintances; as well as her strange personal habits and unusual mode of operandi (her hatred for Donald Trump is also well documented).<br />The only redeeming quality it seems is Leona's motto that the customer is always right. The only people who she really give a second thought to are those who ultimately pay her bills.<br />The bio ends with Leona being sentenced for tax evasion and a final tsk tsk jab at the Queen herself.<br />The book is an entertaining read, except for the chapter on Harry Helmsley which you can skip without missing anything. And you will walk away knowing why a certain magazine called her the \\"Dungeons and Dragons Lady\\".	2002-04-17

Who haven't heard of alligators in the sewers, the woman who cooked her cat in the microwave, the hooked killer, and so on. Usually, after the story are told, there is a little caption that suggest how the legend may have started<br />As fascinating as these stories are, the book itself leaves something to be desired. Because it seems all too often, the author is either constantly doubting that this is a true story (duh!) or that he cannot believe in the gullibility of people (there is quite a liberal amount of self righteous sarcasm).<br />Okay, we got the message! Just tell us the stories and give us the facts. The book would otherwise woudl have worked more effectively in giving me the creeps. But it didn't.

Then to later years as Natalie struggled with age and the ups and downs of both her career and her relationship with her sister....culiminating to the fateful day when Lana was informed of her tragic death.<br />For James Bond fans, they will probably be interested in Lana's experience on the set of Diamonds Are Forever, revealing an affair with Sean Connery (which curiously, she did not disclose on the special DVD of Diamonds Are Forever).<br />Ultimately, this book is also as much about Lana herself as it is about Natalie.  Forever in Natalie's shadow, Lana herself never developed her own life and identity, everything in her life is connected with Natalie in some fashion and she spends virtually her entire life seeking Natalie's approval and acknowledgement. <br />This book will probably make you see Natalie Wood's films a little differently. Underneath that gamine veneer is a woman who has a fury that Hell can't match.	2002-04-06

US	49555408	R35KED2LQ9OB59	0809232685	212832324	The Complete James Bond Movie Encyclopedia	Books	3	8	14	N	N	Repetitive with glaring omissions	The James Bond Encyclopedia is what it claimed to be, an Encyclopedia of the James Bond films, which featured entries from Dr. No all the way to Licence to Kill, as well as Casino Royale (both the original and the spoof) and Never Say Never Again. A later edition included a preview chapter on GoldenEye.<br />As fascinating as reading the entries, some get a little bit repetitive. For instance, when you look up a characer's entry, and then to the entry of the actor who played him, you pretty much get the same info. Rarely do you get some background info on the actor in question.<br />And Steven Jay Rubin wasted no time trashing three of Roger Moore's movies. Especially A View To A KIll.<br />So Christopher Walken's Zorin is bland and stupid. Okay, so back it up with some facts. Grace Jones was said to be too androgynous for mainstream audiences. Perhaps his idea of mainstream is back in the 1960s, which he is seem to be stuck in.<br />He also said that no one care about the plot because no one care about Silicon Valley, and the film dosesn't explain why Zorin's monopoly on micochips will be so dangerous to the free world. Hello? Are we watching the same movie? As Stacey said, \\"He'll kill millions\\" with his man made earthquake; the danger does not lie in Zorin's monopoly, but in his plans to obtain it. <br />That said, the Encyclopedia also ommitted any mention of Chrissie Hynde and the Prentenders and their two fabulous songs \\"If There Was A Man' and \\"Where Has Everybody Gone\\" for the Living Daylights....but he was sure to mention Phyllis Cornell, who was Tania Mallet's double in Goldfinger.<br />It seems that if a James Bond Encyclopedia is to be written, it should be written by more than one person....and someone more objective.	2002-03-20

It came after the original Monster Manual, but before Monster Manual II.<br />While the monsters in the Monster Manuals are primarily authored by Gary Gygax, the monsters in the Fiend Folio are created by players of the game itself in the United Kingdom. In truth, the book is a compilation of other people's creations, and some monsters (namely from the D series) from AD&D modules.<br />That said, Fiend Folio feature some monsters that survives to this day in the 3rd edition: the slaad, kenku, githyanki, githzerai, aarakocra, achaierai, bullywug, the ever popular death knight, mephits, gibberlings, grimlocks, penaggalan, to name a few.<br />Not to mention there aren't stinkers...there are a whole bunch of monsters of questionable worth,  like the flumph, an unsually aligned (lawful good) thing that was once voted the most useless monster in AD&D, the gambado, the garbug (wasp bodies lobsters(!), forst men, tirapheg, umpleby, adherers, just to name a few.<br />There are also a few standouts like the Elemental Princes of Evil, and the nilbog (goblin spelt backward).<br />One big downer however, is the art. Although there are a few by old time favs like Jeff Dee and Erol Otus, but too many are by other artists whose style are too violently graphic and lack the fantasy feel of the first monster manual.<br />Overall, Fiend Folio is good, but not as good as Monster Manual.	2002-03-13

You don't have to know the complex order of all of the vampire books written by Anne Rice to enjoy Queen of the Damned. There is sufficient background material to keep you abreast of who is who so the book can stand on its own.<br />Basically, it seems that our old friend Lestat had restyled himself in the 20th century as a rock star, and his music somehow have awaken Akasha, the \\"mother\\" of all vampires, from her trance as an unaware alabaster statue.<br />Akasha then went on a personal mission to create paradise on earth by destroying most of the men, leaving the women in charge, and through selective breeding and conditioning would men be introduced back to \\"civilized\\" society; and she has her eye on Lestat as her consort and partner in crime.<br />Akasha also destroyed all the other vampires on earth, except for a few, whom she spared because Lestat would want them around, or because she couldn't affect them because they are as powerful as she is.<br />But standing in Akasha's way are these same surviving vampires, and a certain prohecy proclaimed to her six thousand years ago.<br />Complex and chock full of characters, Anne Rice nonetheless managed to weave it all into one coherent whole and top it off with a shattering (quite literally) conclusion. The most fascinating part of the book is the story of Jesse, herself a descendant of a vampire who uses her own psychic gifts for the organization known as the Talamasca, and the story of the red haired twins, Maharet and Mekare. These two latter are \\"witches\\" whose reputation aroused Akasha's curiousity, which inadvertendly started the race of vampires.<br />Queen of the Damned is a virtual page turner. Unfortunately, because of its length and its complexity, most of it has to be thrown out for the movie version. If you have seen the movie and have not read the book, do it. If might make you appreciate the movie more.	2002-03-13

Its reputation comes from the fact that this dungeon crawl is filled with so many diabolic traps that you probably need at least 16 people, and see who will be the last one standing. If you are not sliced or diced by the few monsters within, you will probably be crushed, thrown into a lava, turned to green slime, killed by poison gas, blown up by a gem, or worse, get soul sucked by the demi-lich at the end.<br />The fact that this dungeon is so lethal also points out its weaknesses. The fact that NO SAVING THROW ALLOWED is one of the most repeated phrases in the adventure should tell you a lot. In the end, when you do meet the main villain of the piece, it can only be destroyed by what seems to be a random set of spells and circumstances.<br />This module is best played with pregenerated characters rather than the one you have played with for a while and have grown quite attached to. Because unless the DM is kind hearted and tone it down and allow saving throws, be prepared for a high body count.	2002-03-13

Then the D series, where the players discovered that the Drow are really still in existant and in pursue of them, descended into the depths of the earth, passing through the shrine of the kuo-toa and finally, into the vault of the drow.<br />And then, to the ultimate module that started the idea that players can kill gods, Queen of the Demonweb pits, where the players go up against the Spider Queen herself.<br />Queen of the Spiders compiled all these seven together, with some extra material written to make it a more coherent whole. In the original series, I never thought why the players would go after Lolth when Eclavdra, the one who started all this trouble, worship the Elder Elemenntal God.<br />In fact, Queen of the Spider is supposed to be the climax of a series of supermodules that started with The Temple of the Elmental Evil, followed by the Scourge of the Slave Lords (which collects the 4 A series modules).<br />As for the section for the D-series, there are suggestions made to develope some of the other encounter areas noted in the underdark map.<br />I have ran this adventure twice and the hardest of all is when the players go after Lolth herself.....and despite having only 66 hit points, she is one mean arachnid, and BOTH times the party dwindle from a dozen to two or three.....and in both cases, Lolth managed to escape.<br />Even if you did kill her, a new section in Queen of the Spiders called : Fate of the Demon Queen, assure that Lolth will come back in one form or another.<br />As good as this collection is, one gripe I have is the map of the demonweb. The place consist of three levels interwoven with each other. In the original module, the levels are in diffenent color to differentitate one from another, in Queen of the Spiders, however, it is in black and white and the level so differentiated from each other not by color but by lines. It gets confusing at times. <br />Ultimately, this module has the capacity to kill off as many player characters as the infamous module \\"Tomb of Horrors\\"...except in this case, you DO get saving throws.	2002-03-03

It has surprised me that it wasn't until now that a book dedicated entirely to these fiends came out.<br />Perhaps because TSR, the former company that publishes the Dungeons and Dragons game felt the heat from over zealous Bible thumpers who think the game promotes devil worship because of its description of devils and demons. So in the second edition, in an effort to appease a population who doesn't even buy the game, they eliminate them altogether. It was only through the outcry of TSR's customers that they crawled...under psuedonyms of baatezus and tanar'ri.<br />Well, third edition, under the d20 system and licence came out and they are back with a vengeance. They are now devils and demons with a capital D and and they comes completed with pentagrams and 666s.<br />\\"Legions of Hell\\", published by Green Ronin, describe the various devils that inhabit the Nine Hells. The cosmology of the Hells is closely related to the one presented by WOTC's Dungeons and Dragons game. In this book you will meet many never before seen devils such as the Ashmede, the Enforecers of Dis, the distender, the oubliette, as well as various dukes and counts that populate the devil's noble hierarchy such as Balan, Antaia, Furcas, Lel, Hadriel and Vuall (who bears a striking resemblance to Joe Camel), also fallen celestials like Iblis and Naamah. All of them illustrated, some of which resembles creations by H.R. Geiger.<br />As good as the book is, that is not to say there are stinkers, like Nergal (some fat slob squeezed into a suit of armor surronded by flies), the Faceless (a race of devil-assassins), the four handed vierhaander, and an unhealthy amount of attention being paid to the duchess Hadriel's many minions. <br />In all, \\"Legions of Hell\\" is something which is long awaited and is finally here. Hopefully, Green Ronin's follow up \\"Armies of the Abyss\\", which will feature demons, will not disappoint.	2002-02-07

From some of the reviews I have read, it is either you'll love this book for its contents or hate it for its contents.<br />Well, infinitely sarcastic and tsk tsking in tone, Kenneth Anger compiled a fascinating, if not nauseating tome of Hollywood gossip, mysteries and scandals; accompanied by a generous helping of equally fascinating and nauseating photos.<br />Just when you think that people are so moral back in the good ole days...well, surprise surprised!!!! Here comes Hollywood, the &quot;cemetery of virtue&quot;.<br />Hollywood Babylon &quot;documented&quot;, with frenzied glee, the various scandals that rocked the film industry, and in turn the world. First we are introduced to the death of Olive Thomas, then the now infamous Fatty Arbuckle trial. These two stories basically set the tone for the rest of the book....rapes, sexual indiscretions, drug overdoses, nervous breakdowns, orgies, murders, creative suicides and so on and so forth.<br />The photos themselves are not for the faint of heart.... featuring death photos of extinguished luminaries such as Thelma Todd, Marie Prevost,Bugsy Siegel, Jayne Mansfield (and her dog!).<br />Overall, if you like gossip and scandal and loves laughing at the misfortunes of others and have a taste for the morbid, this book is a delight...a delectable &quot;box of poisoned bon bons&quot; through which you can choose and pick at your leisure...with every juicy morsel is as good as the next.<br />Otherwise....this book will probably make you nauseous.<br />A sequel, Hollywood Babylon II is not as good as THIS one. But the zinger in that tome is photos of the infamous Black Dahlia murder. But that is another poisoned bonbon for another day.	2001-12-18

Damien: Omen II is a sequel to &quot;The Omen'. The original Omen movie started out as a novel, while Damien: Omen II started out as a screenplay which the novel is closely based on.<br />The story takes place seven years later in which Damien the Antichrist is now thirteen years old, and totally in the dark about his diabolic heritage and destiny. He now lives with his uncle, who runs Thorn Industries, his second wife Ann, and his cousin Mark. As usual, anybody who steps in Damien's way to his destiny or knows his true nature is promptly knocked off in ingenious and gruesome ways. WHile a huge black mastiff lingers around Damien in the first movie/novel, now a monstrous raven hovers ominously nearby.<br />The biggest change in the novel from the movie is the Joan Hart character. In the film, she was merely just a reason for the producers to stick in another gruesome death scene. In the novel, her role was expanded. Her association switched from the David Warner character in the first movie to the archeologist Michael Morgan in the second film's prolouge.<br />Another change is Ann Thorn. In the film it is suggested that she was in league with the DEvil and was dispatched when her usefulness was over. In the book, it is not clear what her true motivation was in the story's finale.<br />Earlier editions contains photographs from the movie, which you may be able to find in used book stores. <br />Overall, the book is a good read, even though it lacked the religious details and atmosphere of the first movie, the book still ended with an evil note like the first one, in which evil triumphs.	2000-12-16

For James Bond fans, this book is a treasure trove of information. It includes lots of information which at first was previously unavailable. Thanks to this book I finally found out the name of the Japanese girl in the Thunderball teaser and the actress who played her, as well as the two women who played Bambi and Thumper.<br />Generously filled with candid black and white photographs, the James Bond Films covered each Bond film chronologically in each chapter. For the Sean Connery films, virtually every meticulous fact about how the film was made is detailed in the book.<br />It is obvious that Steven Jay Rubin have a vendetta against Roger Moore. In his later work, the James Bond Encyclopedia, he would gives a one star rating to three of Moore's Bond films. In the James Bond Films, he pratically skimmed over Moore's films, with the exception of Live and Let Die, possibly because he had the full cooperation of Moore's leading ladies (Seymour and Hendry)from that film, and The Spy Who Loved Me, which is no doubt, one of the best Bond movies ever made, with or without Connery.<br />In the chapter for Moonraker, we didn't really get a lot of background info on it, rather, Rubin just bitched how the character of Bond have been corrupted into a cartoonish character and how Moonraker sucked. The worse offender is For Your Eyes Only.....which doesn't tell you anything at all.<br />The update chapter on Octopussy and Never Say Never Again tied up some loose ends from the For Your Eyes Only chapter (like how Carole Bouquet was perfectly casted as Melina Havelock), but since this book was written when the two films are being released, understandably, not much info, other than a preview, was given.<br />Despite his shabby treatment of the Roger Moore films, The James Bond Films is still a fascinating read.	2000-12-10

But Alan Dean Foster took the  screenplay, and expanded upon it, adding more dialogue in various scenes,  especially those involving the Greek gods, the Stygian witches, and  expanding upon some of the secondary and tertitary characters, such as the  three ill-fated soldiers who accompanied Perseus in search of Medusa. <br />As  opposed to the movie, the book is a great read, and if only the movie  follows the book! If you see the movie after reading the book, the film  will seem incomplete and rushed.
