But, they do serve a purpose.  They provide characters who echo the everyday questions and insecurities that plague budding relationships.  The problems Keith faces are problems faced by many young people.  He moves to a new town and enters a new school.  He is far away from his best friend.  And, he is falling in love with another boy in the theater group.  The interesting thing about this book and its sequel, &quot;Lucky in Love,&quot; is that it portrays prejudice as a very human thing.  The homophobia exhibited in the book arises from the jealousy of the heterosexual characters.  This book fills a void felt by many of us by giving back the dignity of romance.	2001-08-02

In recent years much has been written about the social construction of GLBTQ identities.  This book deals with the extra power given to homophobia when GLBTQ identities are denied.  Caught in the milieu of high school wrestling, neither Joey nor Donald can accept what the love they feel for each other means.  As a result, they are both unprepared to take a stand when their friends attack a fellow classmate and their silence results in his death.  The irony is that both homophobes and GLBTQ youngsters could be PINS (Persons In Need of Supervision).	2001-08-02

As the innocence of Youth drowns in possibilities, this journey of discovery stretches down to New Orleans and extends to the West Coast.

It raises a lot of questions and also raises a lot of warning flags.  Set against the background of a censorship battle and the efforts of right-wing fundamentalists to intrude into the minds of school aged children, a romantic attachment develops between a teacher and a student.  The fact that the student, Danny, is almost at the age of consent does little to stave off the stereotype that could be drawn.  The teacher, Tom York, shows us how not to respond to a student's advances.  The actions of Tom and Danny give the censors the ammunition they need to become a permanent fixture in the educational system.  Still, the story is not one to be dismissed.  At issue are an educator's responsibilities, the needs of young people, ethical behavior, and the age of consent.	2001-08-02

But, when you are young, have no legal rights, and are despised by many other people, &quot;never easy&quot; becomes &quot;almost impossible.&quot;  Casper and Brendan are opposites in every way.  Each of them, on their own, is limited by their situations.  That changes when they are able to admit the feelings they have for each other.  Together they are able to overcome disapproving families, abusive relatives, bigoted classmates, and a world that wants to keep them apart.<br />The give-and-take convention of having each boy tell his own story in alternating chapters presents a clear picture of the relationship between them and heightens the suspense of the story.  Strangely enough, although the convention does intensify the action in the book, it also draws one into the more tender moments.  I was chilled by the therapeutic techniques used to change Brendan and by the abuse in Casper's homelife.  But, I was entranced to watch the relationship between Casper and Brendan develop.  It made it hard to deny that this love is real.	2001-08-02

With 128 pages of text and 16 concise chapters this book corrects much of the white washing that is taking place in much longer history texts, even at the college level.  Religious liberty, Native American exile, freedom from slavery, racial extermination, and ethnic tensions are highlighted with graphic images and easily accessible narratives.  The trials of diverse groups such as Mormons, Catholics, Chinese, Native Americans, Jewish immigrants, Mexican Americans, Japanese citizens, and just playing Americans are dramatically highlighted in an unforgettable montage of images and words that give the lie to the &quot;melting pot&quot; that is the United States.<br />Paintings, etchings, drawings, and photographs illustrate in no uncertain terms would hate has done to this country.  More than that the pictures combined with the simple prose personalizes each inequity that is introduced.  For example, &quot;A Rose for Charlie&quot; presents photographs of the community disrupted by hate, as well as that community's response to the hate.  From  photographs of hate speech scrawled on walls to portraits of citizens mourning the victim of a deadly hate crime present a view of America that could not be farther from the Norman Rockwell ideal we all wish this country would be.  For those interested, a fictionalized account of this particular crime can be found in &quot;The Drowning of Stephan Jones&quot; by Bette Greene, which chronicles the death of the young man simply because of who he loved.<br />It should be an essential book for all classrooms.	2001-07-31

It speaks to many people when different levels.<br />It speaks to troubled teens worried about fitting in as well as to GLBTQ people and their tormenters.  Carla is forced to balance her beliefs against her feelings for a handsome, popular young man.  Deciding that keeping silent is an appropriate compromise, she soon learns the price such compromises can demand.  Over the course of several months, she watches as the violence of the attacks against two innocent men increases in intensity.  At the same time, she is forced to watch the adults who condone such violence launch an attack against her mother, the town librarian.  By the time she decides to speak out, it is too late.  Her bid for popularity has prevented her from showing support to her mother and cost one-man his life.<br />Regrettably, some readers have criticized the characters of Stephan and Frank as being<br />unrealistic and stereotypical.  Specifically, some people think that GLBTQ men who move to roll areas would never act like the characters of Stephan and Frank.  This is unfortunate.  The fact is that there are people who act exactly this way and who move to roll towns.  A quick reading of &quot;A Rose for Charlie&quot; in &quot;Us and Them&quot; by Jim Carnes should give anyone the evidence they need to verify the truth of the characters in question.  The characters of Stephan and Frank were drawn from the story of Charlie Howard and his fate at the hands of ignorance and bigotry.	2001-07-31

Nathan comes from a family constantly on the move to prevent others from realizing the kind of abuse his father forces on him.  Roy comes from a loving home.  Both families aspire to devout religious beliefs.  In that, they are the same, but the reality for both is much different.  What both boys find together in each other outside the lines of oppressive religion is celebrated, even though their relationship is despised by others.  In this, the strength of love is shown to be greater than petty religious beliefs.  Through uncertainty and doubt the boys learn to love.  But, the purity of what they feel for each other is nearly destroyed because Roy cannot find it in him to accept himself as quickly as does Nathan.  Their story could be read as a tragedy or a tale of hope depending on how one chooses to view the last few chapters.  I personally choose to believe that Nathan survived the attack upon him.  However, even for those of the less optimistic turn of mind, the story can be one that excels in hope and confirms the power of true love.	2001-07-31

It is also a metaphor for the internalized homophobia and he must carry with him as he grows up and moves on to college.  The effort Andy expends in trying to hide his own personal &quot;scars&quot; drives him to use himself in books and the rigors of running.  Neither of these are bad things, but a toll is exacted on his social development.  The one attachment he is able to forge during his childhood is destroyed when he is fearful of speaking out.  He backs down from confrontation and plays &quot;the good little boy&quot; when the local pastor treats his best friend, Evan, unjustly.  He even watches Evan being beaten almost to death and cannot bring himself to action because he is afraid that the other students will attack him as well.  Although reading and running save his sanity while growing up, they also serve as a barrier to his full development.  They define his identity and his world.  As a result, he almost misses his chance at true love because he is unaware of the obvious signs around him.<br />It is a tribute to the &quot;scars&quot; we all carry.	2001-07-31

It is about finding a place to fit in which one is comfortable.  In this, it goes beyond the typical story of accepting oneself.  The hardest part of growing up gay is thinking that there is nobody else in the world like you.  For a young man in such a situation it is easy to give into the temptation of giving gratification to a straight friend and become trapped in a loveless relationship, or worse yet be used by older men.  Ewan gives into the temptation of both.  And, he is disappointed by both.  His friend, Leslie, starts seeing women and the older man, Paul, confesses to having a boyfriend in London.  The result is that Ewan ends up alone.  This could have started Ewan on a cycle of discovery and disappointment, except for the fact that his parents discover his diary and read it.  Fortunately for Ewan, they are agreeable to his taking up residence in London, albeit strictly supervised.  This does give him a<br />chance to reach out to the gay community, which is a lot easier said than done.  Gradually, and fearfully, he begins to learn to stand up for himself and for others.  It is more this than anything else that puts in a position to find the love he seeks.  His journey, far from being exceptional, provides the reader with the potential of hope.

The only thing of which he is really sure is that he can't share his doubts with his parents or his friends.<br />The story is told with sensitivity and compassion.

I only wish the author had done more to develop the antagonists.  As vile as Nancy Garden painted them, the reality of people like that is much worse.  Our young people are mature enough to know that not all adults will defend their rights to think and read.  Any child who has searched a school library in vain for a book they really needed to read knows this.  Even in major cities like New York, even in enlightened schools, libraries do not stock books on their shelves that address every student's need.  The solution that the young people in this book created for themselves should be an inspiration for students in every school.  This is one book which should be available for any student who wants to stand up for his or her right to have ideas.	2001-04-10

We also get to see how fully secure, responsible people bind themselves together to stand up for their rights.  What started out as a simple love story has blossomed into a clear look at created families and the superiority they have, in some cases, to their biological progenitors.

It should be on every library shelf and in every bookstore in the country.	2001-04-10

Don't be put off by any warnings.  The people, both young and old, who have trouble with the book reflect more of their own personal problems in dealing with the subject matter.  After speaking to several middle school students who found the book at a recent book fair, I discovered that they were able to empathize with Liam, the hero of the story.  The only thing they couldn't understand is why Liam's mother and aunt behaved the way they did.  They could see in the adults' attempts to protect the boy that they were hurting him more than helping him.  <br />This is a book that should be a welcome addition to any classroom library.  It would even make an excellant text on which to base a series of lessons on tolerance and acceptance.  <br />&quot;The Eagle Kite&quot; soars.	2001-04-10

As more and more school districts realize that it is counterproductive to ignore the abuse and harassment often suffered by GLBTQ students and teachers, there is an increasing need to educate the larger population as well as helping GLBTQ youth understand themselves.<br />Simon Harris makes a compelling case for using the English classroom as the place to discuss GLBTQ issues.  He does this by comparing the English classroom to the other classes being offered in schools.  Since discussion and reflection can be considered more desirable in classes on reading and writing, his point is well taken.<br />To further prove his point he creates two lesson plans for two separate pieces of literature.  The lessons created extend over a six-week period that allow for follow-up activities.  In these lessons, he suggests possible books, films, articles, and writing assignments for the students to explore as they develop a greater understanding for those around them who may be different.<br />I wish there were more courageous teachers who were willing to put themselves on the line so that their students could actually learn something that would help them in the outside world and make the world a better place for all of us.	2001-04-10

He clearly states the case for the frequently forgotten GLBTQ children in our society.  At the same time, he paints pictures of these children and invites us into their lives.  It was hard not to get emotional when reading about the children in the book.  The information included in this slim volume is vital to everyone who works with children.	2001-04-10

Robin struggles with his emerging sexual identity against the background of a suburbia in which Holden Caulfield would feel quite at home.  Faced with a dying brother, parents who refuse to hear his anguish, teachers who ignore his needs, and friends who would much rather use him, he manages to stand up for himself and take control of his own life.  Both adults and young people need more books like this, that examine young people's lives taking into account the real problems that must be faced while growing up.  Unlike Holden Caulfield, Robin doesn't actively tried to make his life more difficult.  His quest is simply to make sense out of the world around him.  In this respect, he is what we'll hope our children will be.  He is a searcher after truth.<br />In deference to the reviewer's who chose to criticize this book by descending to semantics, Robin &quot;invokes&quot; the avatars of popular culture that surround every young person today.  As he soon discovers, they offer little support or comfort.  In the end, as must we all, he must rely upon himself.  Whereas Holden needs a sanitarium to help him adjust to society, Robin makes his own way.	2001-04-10

It is definitely a text which should be under consideration for anyone wishing to enter the social work field.  Katherine Van Wormer presents us with a solid foundation for the study of gay and lesbian lives.  Her experiences with her daughter, and her experience with the sometimes accepting Lutheran Church, provided her with a necessary experience to tackle this subject with sensitivity and understanding.<br />Apart from providing a glossary for heterosexuals at the end of the book and a comprehensive list of usable resources, the most notable feature of this introduction to gay and lesbian studies is the use of asides which are strategically placed throughout the book.  In each chapter, boxes can be found that highlight interesting facts, exercises, speeches, and testimony by gay and lesbian people as well as their supporters.<br />Unfortunately, the text is only an introduction.  The students, teachers, and professionals who study this volume will get a good grasp of the complexity of this population.  They will also come away from the volume realizing that there is indeed much more to study.  More than that, they will come to know that they will also be learning more about themselves as they continue to investigate what they first conceived to be a group of people completely foreign to them.<br />This is definitely one of the better books to come along in recent years.	2001-04-10

But this time, he goes even further.  He deals with ways in which older gay men can be mentors and role models.  Plus he captures the essence of ignorance behind the anti-gay agenda of some misguided Christians.<br />The picture painted is well worth examining.  This book as well as the first two would make excellent materials in a high school course designed to treat the subject of gay and lesbian youth in a positive manner.  It is a shame that so few schools are ready to offer such a course.  The portrayal of all characters could lead to better understanding of, as well as self-affirmation by, gay youth.	2001-03-19

I was happy to discover that he managed to capture the internal dialogue in which every gay youngster indulges when first realizing what must be different about him.  After reading &quot;Billy's Boy,&quot; I didn't think another writer could do as well at bringing the interior world of a gay youth to life.  It is all here: the fears, the doubts, the hopes and the dreams.  It was amazing to discover a coming of age book without cynicism.  In dealing with a real possibility for gay youth from a perspective of affirmation, the author made the relationship that developed between the two main characters, Ethan and Nathan, one of hope.  For some, the relationship may seem a fantasy.  For me, it made me envy what so many didn't have while growing up.	2001-03-17

Even the reviewer for The Horn Book has forgotten that the story  was written in 1939, years before the song appeared. It speaks for the  unreliability of the reviews in that magazine.	1998-12-13
