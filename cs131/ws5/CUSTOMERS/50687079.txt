The only net loss is therefore the money they 1)Smuggle out of the country or 2)Don't spend.  The autocratic government made the former difficult, and poverty made the second impractical).<br />Very important to the collapse were the rise of the Solidarity movement (and the support it enjoyed abroad), and the expense of maintaining a huge military, intelligence complex and the lofty space program.<br />The failure of the USSR to move against the increasing gall of the upstart democratic movements in the central European satellite states, the lack of decisive political leadership and the increased tolerance of political dissent.  This led to a weakening of the republic, but more importantly, the people's fear of the state evaporated.  As the grip over the population loosened, harsh reality came to bear and the system collapsed.	2002-03-07

It was widely reproduced and sent far and wide to the kings and princes of Europe, and became a kind of handbook for fighting the Mongols.<br />His occassional embelishments, held as sacred truths when first written, add unintentional comic relief, and help one understand the mysterious worldview the medieaval European held.<br />I picked this one up for a paper, and was planning to skim through it, but I ended up reading the whole thing.

While Adams' accomplishment and failures are mentioned in the book, they are limited to summaries some may call unworthy of the events they describe.  But that is because this is a biography of John Adams as a man - not a president, dealmaker, founding father or anything else.  After reading this book, one is armed with an entirely different type of knowledge.  It is not a knowledge of who's? and where's? and when's?, but of WHY?<br />The book is a tool for understanding WHY Adams did things, it delves into his character, his personality, his friendships.  His devotion to his nation and his family are given the prominence they deserve in a book about a man who cared for little else.<br />Enough from me.  It's a good book.	2001-12-17

The goal of a biography is to give the reader a glimpse into the world of the subject... to see through his eyes. This work accomplishes that goal.  There is no apparent agenda in the writing of this work besides the accurate depiction of a controversial American - he is neither universally praised or criticized, merely presented.  The reader must judge for him/herself whether his actions were justified, whether he was always in control - or a victim, seemingly unable to steer the ship at whose helm he was alone.	2001-12-17

Michener was able.  It exists now as what I feel to be the most unbiased history (albeit part fiction) of the country at the heart of Europe.<br />Far from taking away from its status as a serious work, the interjected fictional plots add to the authenticity of the novel - they convey the evolution of the lifestyle, manners and culture of Poland in a way that a traditional history could not.<br />For centuries, Poland stood as Christendom's sole defence against the unending onslaughts of the east - Turks, Tatars, Mongols, Cossacks and (more recently) communists.  I applaud Mr. Michener for his accomplished work, and anyone who partakes of the wisdom it offers about an often under-appreciated land.	2001-12-17

He stresses the reason it was so stable and successful was the solid core of reasonable laws, a standing army of professional soldiers and plunder/tribute from surrounding countries.  <br />He illustrates the ways in which the good ideas of the ancient Romans could be applied in contemporary politics (it was written during the XVI century).  <br />Unlike the Prince, which propandasizes his personal political opinions and describes the ideal ruler, the Discourses deal mainly with mundane economic and social issues, with little personal opinion.<br />It is filled with anecdotes about the lives of interesting or exceptional Romans and is not that difficult a read at all.  In reading it for my first-year history class, I found it was a very good summary of the complicated life of the Roman Republic (it deals very little with the time of the Empire).	2000-10-30

The author of this book, for all his in-depth analysis of the American policy-making machine, spends very little time looking into the effect it had on Mexicans and Canadians.  NAFTA was an American idea.  It was thought  up by American economists, cleared by American politicians. Do people  really think that America got the short end of the stick?  Being an  economic superpower, the USA has little in the way of competition as far as  production quantities and costs go (at least on this continent).  The  opening of Canadian borders to cheap and untaxed American goods drove  countless Canadian businesses under - and the long-term &quot;choking&quot;  of otherwise successful and dynamic corporations is still going on.  Let's  face it:  when NAFTA kicked in, the continental US wasn't exactly flooded  with cheap Canadian goods, forcing the closure of numerous corporations,  was it? And Mexico isn't quite the effecient, subversive country of  economist thinkers the book would have you believe.  With a tinpot  government and poor people, they are doing anything they think (in this  case, what the Americans tell them), will improve the lifestyle of their  people somewhat.  And if a few jobs come the way of Mexico?  If a few more  peasants can now earn enough to feed their families?  Outrage!  Americans  should have every one of those jobs!  In the States, a machine would end up  doing most of the work anyway. I don't begrudge poor Mexicans for wanting  to feed their families - neither should America.	2000-05-07

As an English student, I've come to appreciate the level to which Michener can analyze a work.  He can draw meaning and nuance from seemingly dry prose.  Micherer's 70-year career has left him well-armed to analyze and  defend any topic.

This novel explores the psychic undercurrents of the previous three novels.  I could not help but feel some pangs of autobiography in this latest novel - a gunslinger,  beyond his time - in his realm, yet out of it.  Roland is a dinosaur -  respected, but despised.  King, a horror/thriller writer, can surely relate  to this situation.  Writing a western/romance well past his prime, is King  the gunslinger?  The author deepens one character while ignoring the other  two.  A superb artist of the english language, King is nevertheless  burdened by a overbearing narrative style, which occasionaly buries his  true meaning and results in hefty tomes such as this one.  King is too  subtle a writer to directly state the differences between the good and evil  characters in his works, yet state them he does.  There is never a question  as to which characters the reader is to love or hate. He is further at  fault for repeating Francis Coppola's mistake in &quot;Heart of  Darkness&quot; - attempting to define Ultimate Evil.  Like Alan Grant's  &quot;Unkillable Thing&quot;, such a concept is too difficult to project to  the common reader, and is thus doomed to fail as a literary device.  In his  favour however, his subtle contrast between Shakespeare's heavenly Cordelia  and his own Cordelia Delgado is a brilliant concept and an effective form  of foreshadowing.  Despite her namesake, she is more akin to the  calculating Lady Macbeth and becomes one of King's greatest creations.  Her  end, like Cordelia's and Lady Macbeth's is essential to the plot and moving  on of the protagonist.  All things considered, a well-rounded novel by a  veteran.	1999-11-29
