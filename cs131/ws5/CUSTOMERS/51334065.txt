The Reading medical examiner, on the other hand, is up to the task ... and her autopsy shows more than a cracked eggshell: someone shot minor baronet Humpty Stuvesant van Dumpty in the back as he sat pickling his innards on his favorite wall.<br /><br />Detective Inspector Jack Spratt is on the case, with Sgt. Mary Mary and the entire Nursery Crimes Division at his disposal. Of course, the department is on the brink of ruin after failing to convict three little pigs for the premeditated murder of B. Wolff, and a more published wing of the law enforcement machine is elbowing to get in on the case. And in the Reading Police Department, where \\"true crime\\" magazines eat up the very best cases for an insatiable public, it's publish or die.<br /><br />Suspects are plentiful -- Dumpty, an ex-convict, womanizer and former philanthropic millionaire, has made his share of enemies over the years -- but bodies soon begin piling up as the case grows increasingly tangled.<br /><br />\\"The Big Over Easy\\" is a comedy-mystery from Welsh author Jasper Fforde, best known for his popular Thursday Next series. The good news is, it looks like Jack Spratt and Mary Mary will become a new regular feature as the Nursery Crimes series continues -- and believe me, this new vein of stories is too rich to leave untapped. Fforde wields the obvious potential for humor with a deft hand, at times hammering blatant puns home with careless abandon, at others injecting a more subtle wit into the prose. There are also a number of delightful supporting characters and slightly askew cameo appearances drawn from nursery rhymes and other popular fiction.<br /><br />Humor aside, the mystery is also a puzzler, with Spratt dismissing the more flamboyant displays of his publicity-happy peers and buckling down into some good, solid investigation as the body count grows and the list of suspects dwindles. Each chapter begins with a faux historical or journalistic excerpt that adds further layers to the complexity of Fforde's world.lays of his publicity-happy peers and buckling down into some good, solid investigation as the body count grows and the list of suspects dwindles.

The eponymous star of the book, Zenia, doesn't actually appear much in the story except through flashbacks; in fact, when the book begins, she is five years dead. Or so Tony, Charis and Roz believe.<br /><br />The three women met in college, but their lives have since gone in very different directions. Tony, a professor of history -- or, more specifically, war -- is married, though childless, and her husband is somewhat fragile of spirit. Tony is solid, logical and often dispassionate. Charis is earthier, wrapped in new-age philosophies. She is unsure how to deal with her college-age daughter, and she still wonders what happened to her long-vanished husband, a Vietnam draft-dodger from the States. Roz is a typical mother of three (one post-college son and twin high school-aged daughters) and a wealthy businesswoman, president of her own diverse company.<br /><br />Zenia is the woman who wrecked their lives, one at a time and years apart. With a multiple-choice past and an enigmatic present, Zenia has facades upon facades, schemes upon conceits, and she befriends people with ease before corrupting the best parts of their lives -- perhaps for no other reason than she can.<br /><br />Margaret Atwood takes you deep inside each woman's skin -- except, of course, Zenia, who must remain a mystery -- peeling away layers of their lives and examining in white-knuckled detail the events, experiences and tragedies that shaped them. Each woman's narrative seems sufficient foundation for a book even without Zenia's intrusion; combined, \\"The Robber Bride\\" is a tapestry of carefully woven strands, seen individually and successively through each woman's perspective. The flow of flashbacks within flashbacks is effectively rendered, never confusing.<br /><br />It is interesting to conjecture the different lives these women might lead if Zenia had not targeted their vulnerable places. Perhaps better, perhaps worse -- but far less interesting. \\"The Robber Bride\\" is a triumphant look at the core of three women and the multifaceted surface of the one who defined them.nt lives these women might lead if Zenia had not targeted their vulnerable places.

Baur and Summers had no great motive for inventing a holiday, as they explain succinctly in Chapter Two: \\"Talking like a pirate is fun. It's really that simple.\\" And to help readers engage in as much fun as possible, they have devised the parameters of Pirattitude, the state of mind needed to squeeze the most juice from the day. The definition and test for Pirattitude waits in Chapter Three. Then, in Chapter Four, you can try your hand at a brief test of pirate trivia to prove if you know the name of Blackbeard's ship (was it Queen Anne's Revenge or Sissybritches?) and if a proper slug of grog contains rum or Sprite as a primary ingredient. Trust me, the test isn't very hard.<br /><br />OK, now we get to the meat of the book. You wanna talk like a pirate? You gotta know the lingo. And these guys want to help you, although they readily admit their research \\"involved more beer and pizza than actually looking things up.\\" So get ready to pepper your speech with everything from \\"avast\\" to \\"barnacle,\\" from \\"lubber\\" to \\"wench,\\" from \\"booty\\" to \\"salmagundi.\\" And, once you know the words, these scurvy sea dogs help you still more by describing ways to put your new vocabulary to work at home, school, work, church and pretty much anywhere else you might find yourself. (They even provide the very helpful warning that \\"most women do not consider the phrase 'Prepare to be boarded!' an adequate substitute for foreplay.\\")<br /><br />To fill out the book (because it really is pretty slim, after all) the two rum-soaked bilge rats (see how I cunningly weave these piratical words into my text?) provide the lyrics to a new pirate song, biographical tidbits about some real, honest-to-gosh pirates as well as some who exist only on the silver screen, a personality test to determine your level of pirattitude, an advice column and a peek at Baur and Summers' secret ambition.<br /><br />That's it. That's all there is to it. Well Blow Me Down! is a funny, silly book by two silly, funny men who had nothing to do so they created a modern phenomenon.

And Citro doesn't disappoint. The book is fascinating, educational, entertaining and hard to put down. The curses that unfold in these pages stretch from the earliest days of New England colonialism through the modern age of politics.<br /><br />Of course, there must be an entry from the days of Salem's witch hysteria, and Citro supplies the eerie tale of Giles Corey, an elderly man pressed to death for refusing to consent to trial, and whose dying curse plagued generations of Salem sheriffs. In a land where Native Americans paid a dear price to Europe's colonial spirit, you'll find numerous Indian curses such as the one that ravaged the town of Burton and another that made a death-trap of the Saco River.<br /><br />The horrifying fate of Rogers' Rangers follows hard on the heels of plunder and slaughter. The entire population of Dudleytown felt the power of a curse. A luxury steamer on Lake Champlain burned to the water after being cursed by a displaced passenger. The ancient tree of Tarkiln demanded its due respect. And an entire island in Boston Harbor disappeared after a man executed there vowed it would be so.<br /><br />Citro even takes on the mighty Kennedy clan, revealing the tradition of bad luck that has followed family members through several generations and has repeatedly dashed their hopes for power. Although reluctant to veer into a sensational \\"tabloid\\" style of writing, Citro rightly explains that the greatest New England curse of the 20th century can hardly be ignored.<br /><br />Citro has a pleasant way of telling tales; this is the sort of fellow you want sitting in the best chair at a fireside gathering, regaling the party with stories. He lays down the stories in an engaging narrative, then follows it up with citations from available research and his own experiences. The personal touch is a delightful extra step that is lacking from many books in this genre. From cursed springs to damned village, he's been there, and he records his impressions of the experience.<br /><br />When his research debunks a legend, he provides the explanation. In one case, for instance, the well-known story of a self-inflicted curse has its roots in a work of early fiction that spread and was accepted as truth.ghtful extra step that is lacking from many books in this genre.

Arriving in Maryland in 1683, Molly worked for seven years as an indentured servant before earning her freedom and a few of the basic necessities -- an ox, a plow, seeds, a rifle, etc. -- and the opportunity to lay claim to land of her own.<br /><br />Imagine her neighbors' shock and dismay when Molly bought, then freed and married, a slave newly arrived from Africa. Although technically illegal for a white woman to marry a black man, Molly was never charged for the act and her husband, Bannaky, proved a useful and knowledgeable member of the community.<br /><br />Alice McGill's narrative is simple, straightforward and easy for young ears to understand. Her interpretation of the true story is stripped of many details, yet it provides readers with good insights into the life and times of Molly Bannaky.<br /><br />But this book is a good example where it seems that the artist's name should be given top billing over the writer's. The text is no great stretch for a writer; it's a simple summation of events, but Chris K. Soentpiet's depiction of the people and their surroundings brings the story to life, full of expression and rich detail.<br /><br />\\"Molly Bannaky\\" is, in any case, a good introduction for children to early American history and the gender and racial issues that were a part of the nation's development.	2005-07-18

Books	5	10	11	N	N	Another winner for Jason	Jason, a Norwegian writer and artist -- who, like Madonna, Cher, Bert and Ernie, goes by a single name -- supplies a bittersweet tale about being in the wrong place, making the wrong turn and being mistaken for the wrong man. Sure, it's in Jason's signature style, wherein all of his characters are anthropomorphic animals, but that doesn't lessen the impact of the price Alex (and his friend Claude) must pay for looking through the wrong window at precisely the wrong time.<br /><br />Alex thinks nothing of it when he sees a man in a window across the street from his friend Claude's apartment, but the man doesn't want any witnesses to his activities there. So the stranger lies in wait and kills Claude when he returns, then frames Alex for the murder. Now Alex is on the run, and only the kindness of shopkeeper Geraldine keeps him beyond the reach of the law.<br /><br />It's not a straightforward romance by any stretch, and yet a certain tenderness develops between Alex, Geraldine and Geraldine's young daughter. But the police haven't given up on Alex, and the stranger in the window is on his trail, too.<br /><br />Jason's art is sparing of detail -- his characters' large, oval eyes lack even pupils -- but it communicates a full message regardless. Emotions are clear through a character's posture, the tilt of a head, a closeup of the lines above the eyes. Dialogue is also sparse at times, and yet the powerful story flows without a bump or hesitation.<br /><br />Sometimes, bad things happen to good people, and justice is not a guarantee. This story -- Jason's first full-color graphic novel -- will tear a little at your heart.	2005-07-18

Whether lusty or greedy, passionate or political, scholarly or savage, these are women with a positive, independent outlook on the world around them.<br /><br />Robbins saves the tales from being dry biographies and historical anecdotes by injecting a modern woman's perspective into the prose. The dialogue she employs in her stories sounds modern, not ancient; for instance, when the goddess Macha implores her husband, Crunden, not to go to the Ulster fair, he whines, \\"All the other guys are going. If I don't go, they'll say I'm henpecked.\\" (He goes anyway; bad things happen.)<br /><br />Other featured characters of legend include Queen Maeve, whose desire for a powerful bull led Connaught into bloody conflict with Ulster; Skathach of Skye, the mighty warrior who trained the hero Cuchulain in the arts of war and love; Deirdre, who defied the high king of Ulster, Conor Mac Nessa, and ran off with the studly fighter Naoise; Grania, who similarly fled the wedding bed of aging warrior Finn Mac Cool with young lover Dermot; and many more.<br /><br />Although the Christian church took a dim view of uppity women in later years, the coming of Christianity to Ireland didn't diminish the Irish women's strength and independence, as later chapters show. Take for example Kathleen O'Shea, who reportedly sold her soul to the devil to save the people under her care, or the Meath princess Dervorgilla, whose preference for one man over another led to England's invasion of Ireland. (OK, that turned out badly for the Irish.) The Clare witch Biddy Early defied church laws to help people as a mystical healer and seer, while Grania O'Malley, who made her home on Clare Island, grew to be Ireland's fiercest pirate queen.<br /><br />There's also the goddess Brigit, whom the church made into a saint to help with its conversions, and Eliza Gilbert, who fooled the world into believing she was the Spanish beauty Lola Montez. By the 19th century, Lady Jane Wilde (Oscar's mom) was writing columns fomenting rebellion, and Lady Isabella Gregory was resurrecting Ireland's mythic past and Maud Gonne was inspiring Yeats to greater literary heights (while thrice spurning his more familiar urges). In 1916, Countess Constance Markievicz, who grew up in Sligo and married a Polish count, fought in the Easter Rising, while across the ocean, Irish Americans like Mother Jones, Elizabeth Flynn and Margaret Sanger redefined the boundaries of equal rights.<br /><br />And there are more.

But Star of the Sea is a hell-ship, barely seaworthy, carrying too many starving and pitiful Irish refugees from the great famine of 1847 in its hold, carrying too little food and fresh water, and numbering at least one black-hearted killer among its passengers.<br /><br />Star of the Sea, a daring novel by Irish author Joseph O'Connor, is an engrossing tale of many parts. It is an engrossing murder-mystery set at sea. It is a piece of historical fiction that presents a vivid picture of a grim, hopeless time. It is a tale of disease and deprivation among the desperate poor of Ireland, whose hopes for escape are too easily shattered by circumstance. It is an indictment of class and privilege. It is a series of character sketches, colorful episodes, dark secrets and layered purposes.<br /><br />This ambitious book reads so realistically, it's hard to believe it's not lifted directly from the pages of history. Set within the framework of a 27-day voyage from Liverpool to New York, the story unfolds through a series of narrative sequences, flashbacks, letters, log entries and reminiscences. The dramatic and complex plot comes to us through varying perspectives, and O'Connor juggles diverse points of view without ever letting the thrust of his story slip. He avoids the easy path, the overly sentimental images that could steal the wind from his sails; his blunt honesty about conditions in Ireland and aboard ship is a heavy enough weight in the belly that he need not resort to such obvious tricks. He wraps a vital message within an epic tale that will not soon be forgotten.	2005-06-04

Even those people deserving high praise today, be they musicians, writers, artists or whatever form of creative mind they've become, had to work from the bottom, earning their skills through trial and error.<br /><br />So it was with Charles de Lint, certainly one of my favorite writers and a man whose inventive stories have earned him devoted followers around the world. He, too, had to sift through the grist of his imagination and hone his skills as a wordsmith before earning the accolades he deserves today. A glimpse of his journeyman days as a writer is available in a new limited-edition collection from Subterranean Press. A Handful of Coppers collects various heroic tales from de Lint's early years of writing, primarily from the late 1970s and '80s, when his focus was still largely on high fantasy, sword-and-sorcery stuff that quickly fell by the wayside as he developed a more contemporary style.<br /><br />The first sequence of stories focuses on a sword-wielding warrior babe of the sort well-known to fantasy buffs. Aynber is of course beautiful -- golden hair, grey-green eyes and a distracting physique -- and she goes into frays wearing clothes designed to promote, not protect, her ample chest. She is usually down on her luck despite her many successful quests -- a peculiarity of a lot of heroes in this genre -- and consorts with wizards of questionable skill and intent. She lives in a fairly generic fantasy world, instantly recognizable to anyone who's dipped into the post-Tolkien genre. And there are other predictable elements, each fairly common to the genre: brigands who don't bathe and get drunk when they shouldn't, spells that backfire with comical (and dangerous) results, a heroine who loses her top in a struggle so her breasts \\"heave in the moonlight.\\"<br /><br />But after two fairly standard thud-and-blunder tales, de Lint begins settling into certain choices that would figure heavily in his later work. In \\"Stormraven,\\" the third of six in the series, he begins weaving music into magic. Better still are the four stories featuring Colum mac Donal, a berserker among Irishmen who flees his homeland in \\"Night of the Valkings\\" after an unsuccessful king-breaking and serves in Britain with the bearish Artor. \\"The Ring of Brodgar\\" and \\"The Iron Stone\\" encompass several key years in the Arthur legend before returning Colum home to reclaim his lost love and take up his former cause.<br /><br />The stories, although written separately and published between 1978 and 1985 in Space & Time, work extremely well in unison as a short novel. The final chapter, \\"The Fair in Emain Macha,\\" also appeared (in a slightly different form) as a Tor Double in 1990, coupled with Fritz Leiber's \\"Ill Met in Lankhmar.\\" De Lint's sagas are exciting, evoking the Celtic age of heroes with great success -- this portion of the book is easily my favorite.<br /><br />Colum's adventures in Ireland and Britain came to a close far too soon for my tastes, and I found myself wishing for a fifth chapter detailing his final voyage and his life in ... well, I'll let new readers discover for themselves where he goes, but there's a story there that needs telling!<br /><br />Next, de Lint returns us to the same fantasy world inhabited by Aynber, focusing now on Damon, a half-aelven and half-daemon fighter who cares little who gets in the way of his mystic sword. Let's be honest, a daemon named Damon is hardly a unique literary conceit. In \\"Wings over Antar,\\" he is at least a misunderstood anti-hero, his villain's face concealing a rough-hewn heart of gold. But in \\"Dark Gods Laughing,\\" Damon has dropped the pretense of inner goodness and lives up to his name. Without a sympathetic protagonist, the two Damon tales are less interesting -- appropriately, they are also short.<br /><br />The last two stories in this collection are from the world of Liavek, a fantasy setting created by Emma Bull and Will Shetterly, who edited several volumes about the city and its inhabitants. Never having read the series, I feared the tales would be missing some element of flow or vital context, but thankfully they stand well on their own. Both feature the itinerant minstrel Saffer; \\"The Rat's Alley Shuffle\\" is the more whimsical of the two, involving a fixed card game and a wizard's comeuppance, while \\"The Skin and Knife Game\\" with Lee Barwood is creepier and far more sinister.<br /><br />I haven't read much heroic fantasy in recent years, ever since the cover of de Lint's Yarrow caught my eye and drew me into a different sort of fantasy world. I found myself enjoying these early tales far more than I expected; even knowing my love of de Lint's writing, I half-expected the clash of swords and chanting of spells would grow at least a little tiresome by the end. But no, I was surprisingly refreshed by this trip into the literary past (both mine and de Lint's), which ended all too soon.wo stories in this collection are from the world of Liavek, a fantasy setting created by Emma Bull and Will Shetterly, who edited several volumes about the city and its inhabitants.

Books	4	10	10	N	N	Shows remarkable growth	Subterranean Press continues to reveal the early writings of Charles de Lint in this, the publisher's second collection of short stories from the early days of the writer's career. And, while the stories contained in Quicksilver & Shadow are nowhere as detailed or deep as his later works, de Lint shows remarkable growth from the style (and, let's face it, genre choices) exhibited in the previous collection, A Handful of Coppers.<br /><br />This volume, containing 17 brief tales, focuses on contemporary and dark fantasy, science fiction and children's stories. The best-known among them are doubtlessly the three from Terri Windling's much-lamented Bordertown anthologies: \\"Stick,\\" \\"Berlin\\" and \\"May This Be Your Last Sorrow.\\" Like many of de Lint's fiction, these tales dig deeply into social issues such as drug use, gang violence and prejudice while retaining a touching personal relationship with the characters involved -- and, at the same time, providing plenty of gripping suspense among spurts of fast-paced action.<br /><br />Once again, de Lint has opened his past to those of us who weren't lucky enough to be along for the ride from the start. While he has certainly exceeded this level of writing many times over with more recent works, it's fascinating to get a closer look at this chapter in his development in the craft. De Lint fans will want this collection without question; newcomers to his work would enjoy some stories, certainly, but would be wise to begin exploring his worlds elsewhere.	2005-05-06

McCabe gives us one side of the coin with bookend interviews with Gaiman himself. The meat of the collection, however, is a series of conversations with the editors, pencilers, inkers and other creative forces that helped bring Sandman from obscurity to the level of cult icon, as well as other collaborators who have helped define and develop Gaiman's body of work. Sometimes, they talk about Gaiman -- what it's like to work with him, to shape vague ideas into full-blown graphic novels, to stay at his house and drink with him down at the pub -- and sometimes they discuss their own creative processes and the thoughts that go into their work.<br /><br />I'm sure Gaiman would agree the best way to know him is to read from the vast library he has created: novels, short stories, comics, scripts, poetry and song lyrics, one and all. But to dig a little deeper and know Neil Gaiman as others see him, Hanging Out with the Dream King provides an unusual degree of insight into the mechanics of one man's creative mind.	2005-05-06

It is, of course, impossible to know all that is knowable about Irish music, much less present it in a single book. Geoff Wallis and Sue Wilson come amazingly close to accomplishing that daunting task, however, with The Rough Guide to Irish Music.<br /><br />The volume is deceptively small, though thick, and it's packed with information. It begins with an explanation of the roots of Irish music, its relation to \\"Celtic\\" music -- the terms are synonymous in some circles, antithetical in others -- and the people responsible for keeping the music alive and/or bringing it back into the public's fickle consciousness. Next, an excellent chapter spells out the differences among the many Irish vocal and instrumental styles. Do you know whan \\"sean nos\\" really means? Can you identify a reel, jig, slip jig or hornpipe by its time signature? This section will help.<br /><br />The bulk of the book is devoted to a \\"who's who\\" of Irish music, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a reference more complete. After dividing the musicians into loose categories -- singers, groups, families, fiddlers, harpers, etc. -- the book provides concise but thorough biographies detailing their influences and impact on the music scene. Each entry also notes the most influential albums from each band/musician, making it easy for readers to know where to expand their collections.<br /><br />The book ends with a listing for sessions around Ireland, plus music festivals, schools, media, recommended reading and other resources.<br /><br />If you have any interest in expanding your knowledge of Irish music and Irish musicians, this is the place to do it. The Rough Guide to Irish Music is a phenomenal package that's useful and well-written to boot. It's compact size makes it easy to stow in a music case or jacket pocket, and I predict you'll find yourself pulling it to browse a lot more often than you'd expect for a reference book.	2005-05-01

Mel Bay's Complete Irish Fiddle Player by Peter Cooper is a treat!<br /><br />Too often, words such as \\"complete\\" are bandied about in the titles of so-called comprehensive works, but their shortcomings are often all too apparent. That's not the case with this one, however; Cooper has packed a wealth of music and information into this release from Mel Bay.<br /><br />No, I'm not suggesting Cooper has provided -the- source for Irish tunes. There are bigger and better collections on the market. But if you're looking for more than just notes on a page, this is a good place to start.<br /><br />Cooper's introduction begins with a brief definition of Irish music and a history of the form's evolution. He explains why Irish music is usually learned by ear, not from sheet music (although, obviously, he's hoping readers will find the sheet music included in his book useful!), and describes the basic structure of the tunes, techniques for bowing, fingering positions, tempos and other idiosyncrasies of the Irish style. He also delves slightly into the regional differences which divide Ireland, where a Sligo fiddler can be distinguished from a Kerry fiddler, and so on, although this is by no means a comprehensive analysis of geographic variations.<br /><br />The bulk of the book is, obviously, devoted to tunes, but Cooper doesn't settle for simply collecting sheet music in one volume. He divides tunes by style (jigs, hornpipes, reels, etc.) and describes methods for playing each. In the first section of jigs, for instance, he discusses basic bowing patterns. In the next section on reels, he gets into arm weight and finger rolls. Techniques and variations grow more complex and advanced as Cooper progresses through 19 chapters of music, comprising a total of 80 tunes. He also provides brief backgrounds on the tunes, providing a cultural context often overlooked in Irish music collections.<br /><br />His narrative is smooth and easy to follow, making even difficult moves sound easy. It's easier still when you listen to the companion CD (actually, a two-CD set spanning 55 tracks), which gives practical examples of the style.moves sound easy.

No music, sadly, although it does contain notation for chords. But wow, what a great collection of words!<br /><br />The table of contents is 13 pages long; the alphabetical index in the rear is 10. Subject headings range from \\"Bile Them Cabbage Down\\" (hoedowns, jigs and reels) and \\"All Over This Land\\" (songs of green places, big cities, mountain ranges, waterways and prairies) to \\"The Farmer is the Man\\" (songs of renters, hayseeds, sharecroppers and workers on the land), \\"Roll in My Sweet Baby's Arms\\" (pretty self-explanatory, don't you think?) and \\"Murder Most Cruel\\" (songs of cruel mothers, jealous lovers, quarreling brothers and other bloody ballads).<br /><br />Those are just a few of the 39 separate song chapters. Songs are drawn from all over the world, too -- lots of American songs, plenty of Ireland and Britain, plus a scattering of French, Yiddish, German, Mexican, Canadian, Australian and more.<br /><br />If it's lyrics you want, chances are pretty good you don't need to look much further than Folksinger's Wordbook.	2005-05-01

He was a sailor and a shantyman, making his living from the ocean as long as his kind of worker was still needed. But as machines replaced men on many of a ship's backbreaking tasks, the need for rhythmic shanties to unite the men's labors and lift their spirits were no longer needed. Fortunately, Hugill did his best to preserve the old songs and their histories, and this volume is a true labor of love.<br /><br />Hugill, who died in 1992 at age 86, is remembered in this new edition as \\"a singer, raconteur, amateur anthologist, armchair philologist, self-taught artist, and boon companion.\\" He worked hard at sea during peace and war, survived two shipwrecks, was a German prisoner of war, retired into a new career as a boatswain and sailing instructor for Outward Bound, and was the person most responsible for preserving and reviving the shantyman's art.<br /><br />The 42-page introduction, titled \\"The Art of the Shantyman,\\" is worth the cover price alone for anyone interested in the history, development and practical applications of shanties, as well as the various historical efforts to trace their roots. Afterwards, the book is packed with lyrics, including variations, and exhaustive details of the songs' distinct uses at sea. The notes are printed for anyone who wants to play or sing the tunes, and Hugill also provided illustrations showing seamen singing at their work.	2005-05-01

Some folks will have you believe that \\"The Stupidest Angel\\" is about the violent death of Santa Claus. Or the ghastly resurrection of Santa Claus. Or even a member of the Heavenly Host, an archangel no less, who is a few feathers short of a full wingspan. But no. Christopher Moore's latest novel is about the people -- the wonderfully quirky, eccentric and at times downright insane people -- of Pine Cove, Calif.<br /><br />Moore has conceived a wonderfully witty comedy of errors, taking the spirit of Christmas and grinding it under his boot heel like a noxious cigar. This isn't a holiday tale full of candyfloss and holly, oh ho ho no, it's a twisted whodunnit (without the mystery part, of course, since we know exactly who did what to whom) overlaid on a jittery small town that lives for its Christmas tourism boom. If, by the end of the book, you haven't laughed your eggnog out through your nose, ask local bartender Mavis Sand to describe the contents of her signature holiday drink, a Slow Comfortable Screw in the Back of Santa's Sleigh.

It's amazing to think what strange situations walkin' and talkin' animal characters can find themselves in. This long-running series by Stan Sakai features a ronin (masterless samurai) in feudal Japan. This ronin, fierce with his sword and living with the shame of a lord slain under his care, is a rabbit.<br /><br />Miyamoto Usagi is ruled by guilt ever since his master was killed in battle. Now he wanders the tracks of Japan, righting wrongs where he may, taking mercenary or bodyguard jobs when available. His sword smells of blood.<br /><br />Did I mention he's a rabbit?<br /><br />This, the first book of the series newly reprinted by Fantagraphics, certainly has its portion of cartoony violence. But don't make the mistake of assuming it's silly. This series of tales is fascinating, packed with historical detail and completely absorbing. Stand-alone tales are mixed with several that follow Usagi's personal quest for vengeance against an evil and powerful foe; the latter certainly inspire readers to look for other books in this series!<br /><br />This book is highly recommended.	2004-11-17

The recent film Master & Commander: The Far Side of the World sparked my interest in Patrick O'Brian's lengthy series of nautical adventures featuring Capt. Jack Aubrey and his close friend and ship's doctor, Stephen Maturin. While the source novel, The Far Side of the World, comes at a midpoint in O'Brian's chronology, it provides a familiar port for a movie fan to embark on the journey. (Had I read the book before seeing the movie, this might be an entirely different review; now, a comparison between the two is inevitable.)<br /><br />O'Brian's novel is an intelligent, fascinating look at British naval life during the Napoleanic wars. The author quickly draws readers into the world of seamanship and His Majesty's Navy, filling the pages with rich images and jargon that bring a bygone era back to life with less flash but more substance. Book and movie are both enjoyable and absorbing; still, readers will find very little resemblance here, as the movie draws very few scenes and plot twists from O'Brian's text.<br /><br />Characters, on the other hand, are better developed in these pages, and there are more of them to boot. Relationships aboard ship are more fully explored and there are even a few women -- a handful of officer's wives -- among the passengers. Subplots dealing with international intrigue, shipboard romance and murder (that were dropped entirely from the movie script) kept my interest level high. There is plenty of humor, too, providing the occasional elbow jab in the ribs and hearty chuckle.<br /><br />The novel can be slow-moving at times; it seems an endless wait before HMS Surprise and her crew even leave port! But there's interest in the details even while bound to land -- Maturin's eccentric fascination for birds, for instance, and the gauntlet of formal meetings and informal callers Aubrey must deal with as he tries to hasten his ship's departure. The voyage itself, to action hounds, will seem interminable. The U.S. frigate Aubrey has been ordered to find and take or destroy doesn't even appear until more than 200 pages have passed -- and even then, it passes quickly by. The cat-and-mouse game that dominated the movie is, here, more mouse than cat.<br /><br />Don't read the book looking for great sea battles, cannons blazing and cutlasses at the ready, either. There is no great sea battle at the climax, but O'Brian's denouement is satisfyingly unexpected.<br /><br />I kept turning pages with unflagging eagerness as the story unfolded. The Far Side of the World is not high adventure, but it is historical fiction of the highest order.een ordered to find and take or destroy doesn't even appear until more than 200 pages have passed -- and even then, it passes quickly by.

The boggart in particular benefits from Cooper's skillful pen; rather than an anonymous imp, the boggart develops a distinct personality that is freshly unique. Its memory is short, but very long; its emotions are keenly and vividly felt but are blunted by its alien perspective on the modern world.<br />While Cooper is best known for Arthurian-based The Dark is Rising series, The Boggart handily demonstrates her facility for young-adult fiction in a less ambitious but no less enjoyable setting. A quick and easy read, The Boggart isn't likely to sleep on your shelf for long before waking and demanding to be read again.	2004-07-14

Still, young readers (and adults, too!) will enjoy this fractured version, which starts with Ella enduring lessons in etiquette, needlepoint and other princessly duties in the castle of her betrothed, Prince Charming. But, while the prince is, of course, charming and quite handsome to boot, Ella begins to wonder if that's a suitable foundation for lifelong romance.<br />Of note, this book gives us a Cinderella who does not rely on fairy godmothers, talking mice or convertible pumpkins to make her way to and from the prince's ball. Determined to go despite the scorn of the \\"step-evils\\" who plague her life, Ella uses the resources at hand and no small amount of ingenuity to get herself where she wants to be (as explained in a brief but entertaining flashback, in which we learn that glass slippers hurt).	2004-07-14

Gene and Gina talk like an old, married couple.<br />They're not married. They've never met. But they bicker -- affectionately, mind you -- with the comfortable familiarity of longtime chums. And in their book-length dialogue, they set straight all of the issues, myths, misconceptions and bugbears that have dogged the heels of male-female relationships since the first neolithic couple argued over the color of their cave wall art.<br />OK, so maybe I'm with Stupid doesn't quite live up to its ambitious subtitle: \\"One Man. One Woman. 10,000 Years of Misunderstanding Between the Sexes Cleared Right Up.\\" But it comes pretty close.<br />During the course of the book, they engage in pointed discourse on matters ranging from parallel parking and the subtleties of color to the roles of men and women in history, pronouns, perfect vacations and Marilyn Monroe's weight. There is talk of sex, of course, as well as the obvious topics of marriage, infidelity and public restrooms. Gucci has its day, as do car sales, poetry, pubic hair, movies, pornography and sports. And, obviously, there is a raging debate over jokes, varied opinions on the merits of humor, farts and the evolution of the giggle.<br />I'm with Stupid will make you laugh. It will make you think, perhaps in ways quite foreign to you no matter what your gender. It's smart and clever, irreverent and wise. Read it, then share it with someone you love.	2004-07-14

Now, de Lint and artist Charles Vess have created a modern folk tale in which a young girl and the spirits of trees interact with the innate magic of cats.<br />The story is written for children, but adults -- particularly those who have been steeped in de Lint's lore in the past -- will still find this tale absorbing. It's perfect to read aloud to a child or for an intermediate reader to enjoy alone. The artwork, too, is an integral part of the story; Vess supplies us with a very vivid, spindly limbed and red-haired young heroine, brimming with sparkle and delight, seeing the world through deep, thoughtful eyes.<br />And the cats?

Simpson of her day	Rick Geary makes that clear on the back cover of The Borden Tragedy, a straightforward investigation into the infamous double murder in Fall River, Mass., in 1892. While the contents of the book focus strictly on the case, its victims and suspects, the back cover draws various amusing (and convincing) comparisons between Borden in 1892 and Simpson in 1994, from the celebrity surrounding the crime to the &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict that closed the trial.<br />Between the covers, however, Geary provides a wonderfully direct account of the incident, drawing on anonymous memoirs from the time they were discovered in a trunk in 1990. While using that typed manuscript as his source, Geary verified his facts with numerous other sources, compiling a fascinating summation to accompany his illustrated narration.<br />The terse account is filled with details that suggest it was written by a close associate of the family. The narrative is written formally, evocative of the time, and Geary's black-and-white illustrations provide a fly-on-the-wall view of events as they unfolded. The book draws no conclusions about the murderer's identity; the killer is always off-panel or shown only in shadow. And, while a small amount of blood is unavoidable in a story of this sort, the book never descends into tasteless levels of gore.	2004-02-08

The story focuses on the Rom, modern gypsies living in Canada, who -- despite some modern adaptations, such as big, gas-guzzling cars instead of caravan wagons -- continue to live outside the mainstream: secretive, mysterious and distrustful of strangers.<br />But, insular or not, de Lint has written about the Rom society like a native, delving deeply into customs, traditions and psyches -- and mysticism, an exotic belief system very different from the Celtic and Native American mythologies more frequently tapped in de Lint's work.<br />The novel unfolds as a killer stalks Rom and Gaje alike; the murders grow increasingly horrific and bloody, and a solution to the threat he presents seems increasingly elusive. The climax is a whirlwind of violence -- readers may be shocked by some plot developments along the way -- but the ultimate closure comes abruptly. The final twist is startling and is not the ending I expected -- but de Lint knows what he's doing, and the desperation of the concluding pages feels appropriate to the circumstance.	2004-02-08

Now, the many tales of Palomar have been collected by Fantagraphics in a new hardback edition that brings its simple joys and tragedies together.<br />The stories aren't always linear, and characters gain solidity as Gilbert leaps back and forth in the timeline, introducing some as children, some as adults, and filling in various romances, breakups and acts of violence along the way. Key friendships hold firm from start to finish, and it's fascinating to watch them evolve as some characters go their separate ways and others grow closer than ever.<br />Gilbert's black-and-white art is crisp, clean and realistic. His people are believable; some are beautiful, some ugly, others average -- like those you'd find in any town. Their personalities are also highly defined, and it's fun to see them change as the years roll along.	2004-01-28

Henry Atherton is a fairly ordinary English boy, whose youthful optimism is shaken by a parent's infidelity and impending separation. Pyrgus Malvae seems to be a fairly typical disaffected fairy prince, impulsively making up the rules as he goes along -- until his fondness for kittens and, it seems, all creatures great and small forces the reader to reconsider his motivations.<br />These two characters collide when a portal from Pyrgus's world lands him in the backyard garden of Mr. Fogarty, Henry's elderly, somewhat paranoid employer with a genius for invention and a surprisingly shady past.<br />There are plots worth pursuing in both worlds, but those from mundane England are given short shrift here. Instead, Irish author Herbie Brennan focuses on Pyrgus's plight in both worlds and the various dark and demonic forces that threaten the peace of his fairyland home and his family's safety. In fact, it is sometimes hard to be sure who the real protagonist here is -- Henry, Pyrgus or Pyrgus's sister, Blue.<br />There will be plenty of time to sort all that out in the inevitable sequel. Meantime, Faerie Wars is a fine introduction to Brennan's dual world and opens many intriguing possibilities for future stories. Targeted for young adult fans of fantasy and contemporary fantasy, it will appeal equally to adult readers.<br />My only complaints are a too-neat resolution to one aspect of the story -- too much hinges on a convenient stumble at just the right moment -- and the feeling that we still know too little about Pyrgus's world by book's end. That, too, I imagine will be addressed in the sequel, and I urge fantasy buffs to pick up this series from the start.	2003-08-28

Combined, their work is a wonderful way to re-expose yourself to the ballads.

Printed in 1983, the Fakebook remains the undisputed champion of music references for fiddlers, and it's aided a fair number of other non-fiddlers as well.<br />Inside its broad covers you'll find nearly 500 tunes from the various fiddle traditions. Jigs, reels, hornpipes, rags and breakdowns, each clearly labeled for origins (Irish, bluegrass, French-Canadian, old-time, etc.) and including a short list of recordings where the tune can be heard. Just flip it open randomly for a taste of its contents, and imagine the sound of tunes like &quot;Haste to the Wedding,&quot; &quot;Leather Britches,&quot; &quot;The Munster Buttermilk,&quot; &quot;Drowsy Maggie,&quot; &quot;The Wind That Shakes the Barley,&quot; &quot;Hanged Man's Reel&quot; and &quot;Great Big Taters in Sandy Land.&quot;<br />Eight pages of textbook materials -- music theory, history and culture, style and genre -- give a wonderfully brief overview of the things you'd like to know without loading the book down with endless information which, frankly, can get in the way of the tunes and make it too bulky for carrying. Better still, the book is held together by a sturdy plastic binding which allows you to plop it down on your music stand with ease. There's nothing so frustrating as a music book with tight bindings which make it impossible to play straight from the page.	2003-07-16

Sub-titled The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah, the book is written as if it were autobiographical. The protagonist, Richard, is a former writer who hates writing, and so he now makes his living flying around the Midwest in an old biplane, giving 10-minute rides from farmers' fields for $... each. It's a lonely, but satisfying life ... and then Donald Shimoda, a former mechanic and retired messiah, comes into his life. Donald also makes his living as a flier, and the two men fly together for a while. Along the way, Donald imparts wisdom to Richard as a messiah-in-training.<br />The idea is that everyone can be enlightened and, thereby, can define one's world accordingly. It's a difficult concept to comprehend, much less put into practice, so Richard relies on The Messiah's Handbook: Reminders for the Advanced Soul, a gift from Donald, to help him along the way. The book is magical: open it to any page and find a pithy maxim which will, in some way, shed light on your day. Those maxims are scattered throughout the book and, collected together, could probably fill one of those teeny giftshop inspirational books. But they're much less meaningful out of context; within the framework of Richard's story, they're rife with meaning.<br />The easy companionship of the two pilots is a comfortable setting in which Bach sets his sometimes uncomfortable ideas. But it's impossible to read Illusions without getting a touch of inspiration, a new sense of purpose for improving one's own life, or at least one's attitude.	2003-07-16

About the same time that Neil Gaiman took a little-known hero called the Sandman and created the rich mythology of Dream and the Endless, he reinvented another obscure character, Black Orchid, a plant-based heroine with ties to the likes of Poison Ivy and Swamp Thing. In this three-part story, Gaiman gives a whole new slant to the character, replacing a standard, gimmicky vigilante with a thought-provoking new entity entirely.<br />Gaiman's story is brilliantly and expressively told through the art of Dave McKean. McKean employs very little color in his art -- most of the characters and settings are painted in shades of grey. Orchid moves through her drab surroundings in hues of purple. Other colors accent the landscape -- glints of light, flecks of blood, shades of leaves.<br />Black Orchid is a beautiful tale, though at times violent, and I wonder why this character has been ignored in the years since its release. She deserves to see the light of day again. Soon.	2003-07-08

Frank Miller changed the rules in 1986 with The Dark Knight Returns. Jim Starlin follows up on that success, borrowing certain ideas from Miller's landmark story -- including a wicked new Batmobile -- while keeping elements of The Cult firmly within the bounds of current comic-book chronology.<br />The Cult is one of the stand-out stories from the brief period when Jason Todd filled Robin's pixie boots. It also manages to mess with the Batman's sanity and create a major, citywide crisis in Gotham without DC's usual several-month crossover extravaganza.	2003-07-08

But I knew Charles Vess, whose artwork has never failed to captivate me, so I picked up the book even though it was a prequel to a series I didn't read.<br />Not only does Rose stand easily on its own as a classic of comic-book fantasy, it also piqued my interest in Smith's long-running fantasy series. I will know more of these people, these creatures and these lands! But before I journey into the realms of Bone, let's focus on the book at hand.<br />Rose boasts the kind of lush, layered and highly detailed art that has always excited my eyes and drawn my imagination into whatever stories he illustrates. His people -- and, in this case, his anthropomorphic dogs, dragons and rat-creatures -- are by no means photo-realistic, yet they are expressive and endearingly lifelike. The panels seem almost to be in motion as Rose, her sister Briar and the iron-jawed Captain Lucius Down play out their parts in the tale.

The Mos Eisley cantina is the setting for only a single brief, if pivotal, scene in the first Star Wars film. (That's A New Hope for those of you who weren't around when it opened in theaters the first time.) It is there we first see the formidable fighting skills of Obi-Wan Kenobi, get our first glimpse of the hirsute Chewbacca and witness the cunning ruthlessness of Han Solo (at least in the original version; George Lucas applied revisionist history to the recent re-release, spoiling a good scene by making Solo play nice with the bad guy). It also provided us with a quick glimpse of the many diverse lifeforms that populate the spacefaring regions of the Empire.<br />Star Wars: Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina provides a peek into those lives via 16 short stories, each intertwined in some way with the characters and events of that brief movie scene. Each character has little beyond a split-second cameo in the film, a flash on the screen to demonstrate the cutting edge in alien makeup. Now, each has a story.<br />Each also gives readers a slightly different perspective on the droids' failed entrance into the cantina, and each has a different angle on Kenobi's fight at the bar and Greedo's demise.

There's not much action as de Lint spins the background needed for his tale and allows his characters time to grow. But don't assume that means it's a plodding introduction; the tale is enticing from the start. Once the plot begins to unravel and things begin to happen, you'll certainly find yourself riveted to the pages, bitterly resenting anything which yanks you away from reading (including work and sleep).<br />Forget the fantasy -- de Lint makes even mundane moments seem magical simply by drawing the readers' attention to the little details and the hidden mysteries which are all around us, but usually go completely unnoticed.

He doesn't try to persuade anyone, either; he offers various theories and plausible explanations for the events he describes, but they seldom ring true -- obviously, Citro selected stories of happenings which, to date, have yielded no good answers.<br />But while the explanations generally don't hold water, the stories themselves sound very believable and real. That's because Citro also hasn't targeted the stories where a single gibbering yokel stammered out his story to a disbelieving audience; he's tapped tales with witnesses (at times numbering in the dozens or more), substantial documentation and, where possible, the results of formal investigations.	2003-01-27

Part two, drawn by Jacob and Arnold Pander, is ugly; the rest works well although no two artists seem able to reach a consensus about Harvey Bullock's appearance.<br />It's worth noting that this storyline marked a few significant changes in the makeup of the Batverse. It's also a good stand-alone story for any interested in checking in on the characters without fear of getting caught up in an ongoing plot.	2003-01-27

Rather, it's a suspenseful tale with more than the usual measure of humanity. It's suspenseful and character-driven, and both aspects of the novel are equally absorbing.<br />Tor has unfortunately let this one go out of print; hopefully, it's on their short list for reintroduction to the market. In the meantime, this is one worth keeping your eyes open for in used bookstores and online catalogues.	2002-08-28

It isn't too hard to make a decent living in the horror field by throwing in a lot of blood, gore, supernatural monsters and, if there are movie rights to sell, screaming nude females. Fortunately, Chet Williamson doesn't need to use those hackneyed devices.<br /><br />True horror lives in the human mind. True horror lies in the discovery that a good friend is a monster, or in the realization that a wonderful dream is about to be shattered. True horror waits in the pages of \\"Second Chance.\\"<br /><br />Williamson has created a group of very believable, very real characters, and it's very easy to get swept up in the events which soon surround them and the choices they eventually must make. Give it a read. I guarantee, the story will stay with you for a long time to come.	2002-08-27
