It is a big, fat novel I hoped to lose myself in.<br /><br />However, I was disappointed. Perhaps THROUGH WOLF'S EYES would have been better if a good editor had cut this down considerably. I found that thr book slowed down considerably about halfway through. The intrigue, once Firekeeper arrives at court, just seemed ponderous to me. It was not badly written, but the book kept getting left on my bedside table while I went to find something more engaging to read. The intrigue in THROUGH WOLF'S EYES just did not have the page-turning quality required when the plot and cast get so large and convoluted.<br /><br />Perhaps I should try the novel again sometime, and I may do so. There was enough promise in THROUGH WOLF'S EYES that I will almost certainly try another book by Lindskold.	2005-10-09

If you like both romance and SF, as I do, you will almost certainly be delighted! I enjoyed it thoroughly. Someone gave me a copy, and I did not think from the cover that I would like it. After letting the book gather dust on a bookshelf for a few months, I picked it up yesterday and put it down only when I had to.<br /><br />A BROTHER'S PRICE plays around with gender questions, postulating a world in which humans reproduce far fewer men than women. Men have become a rare, prized, expensive commodity. There are other authors who have taken a more serious look at gender questions (Octavia Butler, for example).<br /><br />A BROTHER'S PRICE is a more light, playful foray into this territory, emphasizing action and adventure. It never gets bogged down by taking all this too seriously. It is a delightfully light, quick fantasy read. Though it plays with some big questions, it avoids any peachiness or prescriptiveness. Mostly, this is good fantasy adventure with a delightful cast of characters and setting.<br /><br />I recommend it!	2005-10-01

It reads like well-written suspense fiction, giving you the story of the day through a mixture of stories of individuals and an examination of key facts, including the infighting between the police and fire departments and some questionable design decisions.<br /><br />For me, this was a can't-put-it-down read, even though of course I knew the tragic end of the story.<br /><br />If you enjoy this, you may also want to read INSIDE 9/11, Der Spiegel's account.	2005-08-09

It kept me pleasantly diverted during a long morning waiting for my car to be fixed.<br /><br />Like many good thrillers, the plot and the characters are somewhat familiar but with a few unique elements of their own. The two key characters are Cavanaugh, an FBI agent who is a bit of a rogue and a closet idealist, and Melanie, a black female doctor. STINGER follows their search for the source of an epidemic of strokes among black people. They make an unlikely but ultimately effective pair of buddies.<br /><br />STINGER is not great literature, nor even the best thriller I have ever read, but it is very good. If you want solid thrills and a plot that keeps you wondering until the very end, this is a good pick.	2005-07-10

My husband and I are pregnant for the first time. I read OUR BABIES, OURSELVES with an eye to getting a broader perspective on parenting. OUR BABIES, OURSELVES delivered that. OUR BABIES, OURSELVES gives a broad view of parenting practices, quoting scientific and anthropological studies to give a view that leaves me much more comfortable trying out some practices that were not part of my upbringing. Several years ago, I can remember it seeming a bit strange when I found that a friend and her husband had taken on holding and/or touching their baby for the entire first year of his life. After reading OUR BABIES, OURSELVES, this does not seem as weird as it did then. I may not take on that goal, but I find it much more compelling after reading about practices in other cultures regarding breastfeeding, responding to babies crying, sleeping alone or in a family bed, etc.<br /><br />I was hoping for an anthropological take on the subject and got it. OUR BABIES, OURSELVES also quotes from a number of scientific studies. If you never read scientific nonfiction, you may not enjoy this approach. If, like me, you do, then I think you will find this one a page-turner. OUR BABIES, OURSELVES kept me awake a long plane trip where I had expected to do much more sleeping! I called my husband to share bits and pieces that had me excited and thinking in a new way, and got him thinking too!<br /><br />A quick glance at other reviews tells me that some people found OUR BABIES, OURSELVES overly prescriptive. I did not. I found it less prescriptive than some of the other parenting books I have taken a look at. While Small does come down favoring parenting that lines up more with the rest of the world (co-sleeping, more touch, responding rather than letting children \\"cry it out\\"), I found the sketches of parenting practices in a variety of cultures empowering. They were not all identical. The take away message, at least for me, is to listen more to the child and less to western prescriptions for \\"getting parenting right.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend OUR BABIES, OURSELVES. It is a fun read, and a book that will make you think!ns for \\"getting parenting right.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend OUR BABIES, OURSELVES. It is a fun read, and a book that will make you think!	2005-04-17

I loved it, and plan to recommend it to others. It's too early to call anyone, so I will start with an Amazon review!<br /><br />BET ME is light, fun and charming. Jennifer Crusie does a great job of capturing single girl struggles and making them light and fun. Like many good tales it starts off with 'once upon a time:' \\"Once upon a time, Minvera Dobbs thought as she stood in the middle of a loud yuppie bar, the world was full of good men.\\" It turns out that she is here being dumped by her \\"tall, dark and righteous\\" boyfriend just a few weeks before her sister's wedding. Instead of being a tragedy, this of course opens up space for a good man to show up.<br /><br />The loser boyfriend has been cranky because Minerva has not been sleeping with him. He looks like Prince Charming but has had the poor taste to indicate she is too plump. Cal, when he shows up, loves Min's curves, and keeps feeding her decadent treasts like chicken marsala and Krispy Kreme donuts with chocolate icing.<br /><br />Crusie does a great job keeping the whole think light and fun. The dialog between Min and Cal (the good man) has the energy and crackle of the dialogue in romantic comedies like \\"Desk Set.\\"<br /><br />Late in the book, we meet the Families, and get a dose of what each has to overcome in order to be happy. The pace slows a little here, towards the slow and significant, but never completely loses the energy and charm that keep you turing page after page.<br /><br />A note for the modest: The hero and heroine do finally fall into bed together, and we do have that described to us. If you are bothered by a fairly explicit description, this may bother you.<br /><br />A thumbs up for BET ME! This is Chick Lit at its best.	2005-04-05

I was charmed from the opening lines: \\"Before attempting to penetrate the Evil Overlord's Invincible Fortress, the practical hero will seriously examine the option of maintaining a safe distance and picking him off the ramparts with a long-range weapon.\\" If that does not make you smile, you should probably skip this book.<br /><br />I understand that my engineering friends caught technical in-jokes and puns that I did not, but there were plenty of jokes I could get. As a non-engineer, I never felt left out.<br /><br />HEROICS FOR BEGINNERS is not a Great Book, but I cannot imagine that you want to read such if you have gotten this far in shopping for it. If you want silly, lightweight fun, this may be just the ticket.	2005-03-29

THE PHOENIX EGG is great fun -- an action adventure novel that I read very quickly and did not want to put down. The page turning quality and the touch of the paranormal invite a comparison to Dean Koontz or perhaps John Case, though the book does not at all seem to be an imitation of Koontz or anyone else. THE PHOENIX EGG is a great find. I picked it up because I met the author and was curious. I bought it and stayed up late to finish it because it was a great read!<br /><br />The action starts immediately. We get thrown into a scenario in which we do not know what is going on or why the bad guys are out for blood. Bamberg weaves an enjoyably tangled plot, with plenty of adventure and a touch of romance, before he finally unravels it all for us. I found myself at the end of chapter after chapter saying,\\"And then what,\\" and putting off bedtime for a while longer. I highly recommend THE PHOENIX EGG if you want a good action adventure fix!	2005-03-27

THE PREGNANCY COOKBOOK is a good book, but not a great cookbook. It consists of two main sections, the first on nutrition and the second on recipes, plus appendices that list which recipes are particularly rich in each of four key nutrients (iron, folic acid, fiber and calcium). The Nutrition section contains good, readable information on nutrition. Even if you already have a good command of nutritional basics, as I did, this is good material.<br /><br />The Recipes section is what I bought THE PREGNANCY COOKBOOK for, and what I give mixed reviews to. On the plus side, there are some very good, very nutritious recipes in here, including a number of dishes my husband gives an enthusiastic thumbs-up to. Issues I have with the recipes:<br />- Some of these recipes took me 1 1/2 - 2 hours to prepare, at least the first time. The time estimate given was nowhere close to that.<br />- The author's short time estimates for prep time either assume that you already have everything peeled and chopped/sliced or that you prep foods much faster than I do. Perhaps they are based on your having a food processor?<br />- Many recipes contain ingredients that I cannot easily find in a mainstream grocery store.<br />- Uncommon ingredients are not always glossed with an explanation, and no substitution is offered. For example, a recipe using pappardelle looked appealing. I had a vague idea that pappardelle was a type of pasta. Googling it confirmed that for me, and also let me know that fettuccine is a workable substitute. Checking at my grocery store, I found that indeed we do not have pappardelle, and I will be trying that recipe with fettuccine.<br />- Not all recipes are as well written a set of instructions as they could be. For example, starting the water for pasta was listed as step 7 of 8 on one recipe I tried last week. Fortunately, I preread the recipe and realized that needed to be step 1. Another recipe had me scrambling when it told me to do something with \\"the vegetables,\\" except that it turned out that \\"the vegetables\\" did not include the red peppers, which were being reserved for another step.<br />- Serving sizes seem to be overly generous. Recipes described as providing \\"four main course servings\\" offer more like six at my house. I don't mind this a lot, but I have learned to plan for lots of leftovers when using these recipes.<br />- Sections could have been more clearly labeled visually. Finding the first trimester recipes was easy enough, but the only way to find the low calorie first trimester recipes is to find the end of the section and then flip forwards to look for the page that states that the low cal recipes start there.<br />- The introduction says that this revised version contains simpler recipes. For me, many of these still seem fairly complex. I use this for a couple of special dishes a week, rather than a source of everyday help. At my house, the pregnant woman is also the cook, so simpler is more of interest to me!<br /><br />There are some recipes in here that I think are very, very good. If you get THE PREGNANCY COOKBOOK, I recommend trying: potatoes stuffed with spinach and broccoli (p. 195); spaghetti with turkey sausage, red bell peppers, onions and tomatoes (p. 207; my husband loves this); chilled sesame noodles with vegetables (p. 241, another winner with my husband, though we like a less sweet sauce); rigatoni with wild mushroom ragu (p. 244); chicken, broccoli and mushroom stroganoff (p. 247); turkey sausage with white beans, tomatoes and basil (p. 278; we didn't find lean turkey Italian sausage so we use lean turkey sausage and throw in some Italian spices).<br /><br />As you may be able to guess from that list of recipes, my other comment would be that THE PREGNANCY COOKBOOK has a definite Italian-American slant.

I would be willing to try another, but this novel did not send me rushing to the nearest bookstore for the next installment.<br /><br />A STAINLESS STEEL RAT IS BORN tells you how Jim DiGriz embarked on a life of crime. DiGriz is 17, and the novel does do a good job of giving him a believable smug, smart voice. I would have liked this novel a lot if I had read it when I was about 15, I think.<br /><br />Jim grew up on a planet called Bit O'Heaven. The fat, tame, insular, unimaginative adults that live on this \\"piggy planet\\" are most notable for their expertise at producing incredibly fattening fast food. Jim actually camps in an automated fast-food drive-though at one point. All of this lands as commentary on Americans, but there's no unpleasant bite to it. This is one of the funniest bits of the novel.<br /><br />Our ambitious young hero decides that to become a Master Criminal, he needs a mentor. Master Criminals are hard to come by on Bit O'Heaven, but he does finally locate one. First, he has to notice that Master Criminlas would be the ones who don't get caught, and then figure out a way to connect. Once he does, he gets off planet. He is off on his first adventure, and things should heat up, but instead they slow down, as if Harrison had lost interest.<br /><br />Overall, A STAINLESS STEEL RAT IS BORN comes across as lacking energy and inspiration. Probably the novels written earlier had more of that. I am willing to give the series another try, but I will find a fan and make sure I pick a really good one before I spend any more time on it.	2004-11-11

I heard Elizabeth Moon read an excerpt from this before it was published, and had to wait impatiently for many weeks to find out what happened next. MARQUE AND REPRISAL is a delightful read for anybody who enjoys a good space opera. If you like strong female characters, you'll love it.<br /><br />MARQUE AND REPRISAL is apparently the second volume of a great new series from the reliably fine Moon. I missed the first in the series (TRADING DANGER). I will go back to read it, as I loved this one. If you read this out of order (as I did), note that Moon does a great job of telling you what you need to know. I never had the annoying sense of having missed something.<br /><br />MARQUE AND REPRISAL delivers everything I look for in a space adventure series novel. The book kept me up late, as chapter after chapter had me asking, \\"What then? What's next?\\"<br /><br />At the beginning of MARQUE AND REPRISAL, we meet Kylara Vatta, reluctant tradeship captain. She wanted a military life, a life of adventure, but was expelled from the Slotter Key Spaceforce Academy. Life is looking boring and mundane. Very quickly, though, life becomes anything but boring or mundane. Someone is out to destroy the Vatta family. Someone who had connections with the Slotter Key government. Ky Vatta is up against a conspiracy. They are almost certainly out to get her, too, and she does not even know why.<br /><br />Over the course of the book, Ky gathers a motley crew, a cast of characters we enjoy meeting, and that we will look forward to seeing more of in future books. A very few Vattas survive, and one hooks her up with a charming and unreliable con man, Rafe. We even rescue a Jack Russell terrier, Puddles.  I don't want to say much, as I don't want to spoil any surprises.<br /><br />MARQUE AND REPRISAL delivers a satisfying ending, but leaves enough still to explore that we can hope for many more volumes of this highly entertaining series. I am going back to read TRADING DANGER, and can't wait to read the next installment!G DANGER, and can't wait to read the next installment!	2004-10-31

I loved Phyllis Whitney, Victoria Holt, M.M. Kaye and the like as a young adult. ON THE EDGE OF THE WOODS does not quite live up to those old standards. It's Tyrrel's first novel, though, so comparing her to the best of the genre is hardly reasonable.<br />ON THE EDGE OF THE WOODS was good enough that I read all the way to the end in just a couple of days. At the opening of the book, architect Stacy Addison buys a huge, eccentric, turn-of-century confection of a house, despite its being far away from her city job. It is also something that her sophisticated city boyfriend, Justin, will almost certainly not like and not be willing to fix up with and live in with her. She chooses her heart and the house.<br />After moving in, she starts meeting a wonderful cast of neighbors. One of them, Brand Vandevere, is someone she finds powerfully attractive. However, she also worries that he has a hidden agenda -- getting her out of the house, which he had coveted. A gothic novel swirl of gossip ensues, as Stacy speculates on Brand's motives towards her and his feelings about the beautiful Callie, who seems to have already laid claim to him. It's a familar sort of plot, which Tyrell delivers with enthusiasm and love.<br />As Stacy's time at the manor continues to pull her away from her city life, a sinister element grows. Something if off about the house. Stacy researches the history of the house and the people who lived there, going through old letters and asking neighbors who do not seem to be telling all. She starts getting phone hang-ups, and her city clients are so harassed that they ask to have her removed from their jobs. As her work in the city dwindles, she moves more into the realm of the house, even as the threats escalate. Someone does not want her here. Someone has made it impossible for her to live her old life. Someone is out to hurt her, perhaps kill her. Is it the oh-so-attractive Brand? Someone else? Tyrell very comptenetly keeps those plot twists coming.<br />I don't think I'll ruin it if I tell you she survives, like all good Gothic heroines, though she has been... changed.<br />If you like gothics, give ON THE EDGE OF THE WOODS a chance!e?

Based on this, I would read another of his books, but I will not be in a huge hurry to do so.<br />The narrator of COFFINS, Davis Bentwood, is a physician and a transcendentalist, a follower of the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson. The opening sections of COFFINS, which deal with this very reasonable man resisting and then acknowledging the existence of something that science cannot explain, are engaging. After that, the horror story plays out in a fairly predictable way.<br />When Bentwood finally unravels the heart of the mystery, the pieces fit together, but are missing the kind of charge that makes it hard to put down really great horror novels. I was frustrated at how slowly things moved when I could see where we were going. The puzzle, when finally revealed, seemed a little thin and unstaisfying.<br />Philbrick clearly loves the classics. COFFINS feels like an homage that never quite takes on a life of its own, though the explicitness of some of the events is very modern.<br />COFFINS does offer the pleasures of a good historical novel. The novel is set just before the Civil War, and the political and moral conversations of the day are quite interesting. Frederick Douglass and Elizabeth Cady Stanton actually appear as characters.<br />Overall, three stars. It was good enough that I went ahead and finished it, but isn't one that I'll rush out to share with my friends.	2004-03-21

Inexplicable things start happening, and people start dying.<br />I loved it. The plot revolves around a 30 year old ethologist who specializies in the study of predatory animals. This knowledge serves her well as we unravel the mysteries of who this killer is, why they are killing, why they kill in the creepy ways that they kill, and finally how Diane came to be in the middle of this story. Unraveling all that leads us to explore telepathy, psychokinesis and how the Soviet state funded research in these areas. In the process, we see Diane come to know herself.<br />THE STONE COUNCIL delivers everything you want in a thriller, down to the surprise revelation at the end that brings all the disparate plot elements together at last.	2003-12-22

Afterword Is a Delightful Bonus	I picked this up while browsing in a bookstore because of the author's name. My husband introduced me to Babylon 5, so I now know JMS to be a good TV writer.<br />What had me buy DEMON NIGHT was that two weeks after skimming the first few pages in a bookstore, I was still interested in reading it. I am glad I invested the time and money. It is a solidly satisfying horror novel -- not great, but better than many. The opening pages that hooked me describe a young man who awakes from a nightmare about seeing his parents die in a car wreck, to find his apartment trashed. Again. In the worst way yet. And now he knows that it is time to go back to the small town in Maine where it all started. It's time. Something is calling him home.<br />I especially enjoyed the 6 page afterword in which JMS talks about how DEMON NIGHT came to be written and published. He wrote it for himself, because he could not find the novel he wanted to read. Any aspiring writer will find the afterword interesting and perhaps useful, and any JMS fan will likely be fascinated. It is funny, chatty and leaves you with a sense of having gotten to speak with JMS about how he did it.<br />It's not a great novel, but it's a very good one. I recommend it!	2003-11-10

Helped Me Bake My Best Apple Pie Yet!	THE KING ARTHUR FLOUR BAKER'S COMPANION is a delight, both as a book to read and enjoy, and as a cookbook. The slightly oversized pages allow for plenty of room for the well-laid out text. Ink and paper colors make it easy to read. The handful of photos is attractive and inspiring. Line drawings are well rendered and do a great job of illustrating techniques. Each recipe includes a short or not-so-short comment on the recipe from the King Arthur team. The comments are chatty and interesting enough that you may find yourself paging through the book, reading it for pleasure.<br /><br />As a guidebook and manual, THE KING ARTHUR FLOUR BAKER'S COMPANION is excellent. The book is designed to make it easy to scan and plan. Each recipe tells you how much you'll make. Quantities of ingredients are given in both cups/teaspoons and in ounces. When a dish is made in distinct stages (such as crust and filling), both the ingredients and the instructions are separately labeled. Each recipe also -- though you may not want to know! -- gives very complete nutritional information (calories; grams of fat, protein, carbohydrates, sugars, and fiber; mg of cholesterol and sodium; vitamins and minerals).<br /><br />Like THE JOY OF COOKING, THE KING ARTHUR FLOUR BAKER'S COMPANION includes long sections that talk about the basics, in addition to great specific recipes. I am comfortable with the basics of making piecrust. I read their section on basic piecrusts and it was very solid information. I was so inspired that I decided to step out and try a variation, the Long Flake Method. The instructions were very clear and easy to understand and follow. It was like having a master baker there to give you great bits of advice like \\"Give your chilled dough 10-15 minutes to warm since you made it with all butter.\\" My biggest challenge was believing that my dough should look as it did, as this method calls for visible pieces of fat in the dough. I gave in, followed the directions, and got a wonderfully flaky piecrust. To fill the crust, I used their recipe for The Best Apple Pie. It was delicious. They suggested a bit of rum, which gave this old favorite an exciting new twist. Things were going so well that I also tried their recipe for a streusel topping, and ended up with a fabulous, beautiful apple pie. I got an enthusiastic thumbs up (and clean plate) from my husband and positive reviews from a baker friend that tried it.<br /><br />To address a possible concern you may have: While the King Arthur company sells excellent baking ingredients and tools, you would never know that from reading this book. There are no dicussions of the best ingredients and gadgets and how you can get them from King Arthur. There are no references to brand names, and no ingredients that you can only get from a specialty supplier. The King Arthur team is a class act. (And by the way, I have bought some of their spices. mixes and tools, and all have been excellent.)<br /><br />THE KING ARTHUR FLOUR BAKER'S COMPANION is a book that you can read and enjoy. I recommend taking it into the kitchen and using it. The results will be delicious!<br /><br />NOTE (June 2006): This continues to be a favorite cookbook of mine. I recently used their recipe for a yellow cake and got *rave* reviews from my husband and a number of friends. Their yellow cake recipe produces a simple and yet surprisingly sophisticated cake -- not too sweet and with a texture almost like a good pound cake. I used their recipe for little white rolls at Thanksgiving and got a thumbs up from family members. I could go on. Enjoy!<br /><br />NOTE (November 2011): After *eight* years, this is still my \\"go to\\" cookbook for baking. I have yet to try everything, but am delightd with everything I try.To fill the crust, I used their recipe for The Best Apple Pie. It was delicious.

Things were going so well that I also tried their recipe for a streusel topping, and ended up with a fabulous, beautiful apple pie. I got an enthusiastic thumbs up (and clean plate) from my husband and positive reviews from a baker friend that tried it.   To address a possible concern you may have: While the King Arthur company sells excellent baking ingredients and tools, you would never know that from reading this book. There are no dicussions of the best ingredients and gadgets and how you can get them from King Arthur. There are no references to brand names, and no ingredients that you can only get from a specialty supplier. The King Arthur team is a class act. (And by the way, I have bought some of their spices. mixes and tools, and all have been excellent.)  THE KING ARTHUR FLOUR BAKER'S COMPANION is a book that you can read and enjoy. I recommend taking it into the kitchen and using it. The results will be delicious!  NOTE (June 2006): This continues to be a favorite cookbook of mine. I recently used their recipe for a yellow cake and got *rave* reviews from my husband and a number of friends. Their yellow cake recipe produces a simple and yet surprisingly sophisticated cake -- not too sweet and with a texture almost like a good pound cake. I used their recipe for little white rolls at Thanksgiving and got a thumbs up from family members. I could go on. Enjoy!  NOTE (November 2011): After *eight* years, this is still my \\"go to\\" cookbook for baking. I have yet to try everything, but am delightd with everything I try.	2003-11-10

If you want a mystery that does nothing but deliver suspense, this is not the book for you. This book opens with a quotation from Epictetus which speaks of the human soul and choice, and concludes: \\"For ruin and recovery alike are from within.\\" A WELL-KNOWN SECRET offers both a literary mystery and a very engaging exploration of human ruin and recovery.<br />I see that this is the second in a series. I had not read the first, and found that the book stood on its own.<br />Terry Orr, our hero, is a writer turned amateur detective. He is engaged to solve mystery of Sonia Salgado, who has spent 30 years in prison for a murder she did not commit. What really happened? Why did she do it? Why was she murdered after being released from prison? Terry unravels this decades-old mystery in classic amateur PI fashion -- asking questions, getting less-than-straight answers, getting a bit battered in the process. That part of the novel is well executed, but not overwhelmingly new and different. What makes A WELL-KNOWN SECRET stand out -- and it does stand out -- is the other stories that Fusilli is telling.<br />A WELL-KNOWN SECRET is set in post 9-11 New York City. That story of ruin and recovery runs throughout the book. The more personal ruin that we unravel is that of Terry Orr himself. We read in a newspaper story at the beginning of the book that Terry's wife and infant son were killed four years ago. In the course of his solving the mystery, we find out more about what happened and why, and watch to see if and how Terry and his daughter will recover.<br />A WELL-KNOWN SECRET is a fine novel and an enjoyable mystery. Its somewhat leisurely pace will likely madden anyone after a strict suspense fix. However, if you are willing to slow down a bit, it is a very rewarding read. I found it a bit slow at first, but once hooked, I could not put it down. I read A WELL-KNOWN SECRET in one sitting. I will definitely pick up the next Terry Orr novel!	2003-10-26

"Storm Front" Is a Delightful Page-Turner	Harry Dresden, wizard and detective, is a hard-boiled detective in the tradition of stories by people like Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, and Robert B. Parker. Dresden is a working class detective struggling to pay his rent. The twist is that this Chicago detective is also the only openly practicing wizard in the country.<br />Like the hard-boiled heroes of Chandler and Hammett, Harry Dresden is a smart guy with an attitude. \\"Storm Front\\" opens with a hilarious scene in which Harry meets his new, annoyingly cheerful mailman. Then he gets a couple of phone calls, and we're off to unravel a divertingly complicated plot.<br />In the dedication, Jim Butcher thanks a group of people (\\"the original Harry Dresden fans\\"), \\"Without the perverse desire to make you guys scream at me to write the next chapter, Harry would never have gotten into so much trouble.\\" I'd have screamed, too. Waiting for the author to write the next chapter must have been delightful agony. I read \\"Storm Front\\" in one day and even then was frustrated when there were interruptions.<br />Try it! You'll love it!	2003-10-05

I rarely read tie-in novels, but I recommend this one! I picked it up as much because I like Max Allan Collins as because of the connection to CSI. I have watched CSI on TV a few times, and enjoyed it, but didn't expect much from a novel based on the show.<br />&quot;Sin City&quot; delivers an entertainingly complex story with the mix of gritty forensics and Vegas atmosphere that I enjoyed in the TV show. It is a solidly written novel, and you do not have to watched the show to enjoy it. Max Allan Collins is such a good writer that I recommend this to any mystery fan. And I hope that CSI fans who enjoy this will go on to try some of Heller's other novels!	2003-10-05

I highly recommend it, and will be watching for more from this new author. I see that this is her 4th novel, so I will have to start by catching up!<br />&quot;Nine Layers of Sky&quot; contains elements of urban fantasy, science fiction, and alternate history. It is set in the former Soviet Union, a land of limitations and abandoned dreams. At the beginning of the story, we meet our heroine Elena as she helps out in a small-time smuggling operation. A former Soviet space scientist, she still dreams of working in a space program, and is mopping floors and smuggling in order to raise the cash to emigrate. She is brought together with Ilya Muromyets, an 800-year old immortal Slav and current heroin addict. Elena being a profound skeptic, she is not particularly receptive to an encounter with a hero out of Russian fantasy, and Ilya is not looking too heroic.<br />Elena and Ilya are brought together by an odd little artifact that seems to open windows into alternate worlds. Such an artifact is a valuable thing, and a number of people are out to get it. Over the course of the novel, we unravel the mystery of who Ilya is, what the artifact is and what is to be done with it, and what Elena and Ilya will do next with their lives.<br />If you enjoy this novel, you may also want to check out the work of Charles DeLint, Emma Bull and Neil Gaiman.	2003-10-04

This book is a delightful mix of food writing, recipe book, travelogue, Americana, and good literature. It is light, fluffy and fun, and reading it might just change your life, if you let it.<br />Le Draoulec has a love of small-town America that gives this delightful book the flavor of a Charles Kurault essay. She spent several weeks crossing the United States with two simple rules -- stay off the big freeways and look for great pie. To add to the fun, she took a girlfriend, someone who had explored Australia but never small-town America. The two set off into the unknown, and quickly give themselves over to this delightful adventure.(&quot;We tossed our running shoes in the trunk, and that's where they stayed for the next three weeks.&quot;)<br />As a lover of pie, a baker of pie, as someone who often takes trips on the small roads and who loves to stop at non-chain restaurants, I loved the idea. Le Draoulec delivers. This book is as sweet, wholesome and gently spicy as a good homemade apple pie.<br />But wait... did I mention the recipes? She didn't just find pie, she came back with recipes! I have tried just a few, and each so far has been great.<br />Underlying all this great material is the fact that Pascale Le Draoulec can write. She has a wonderfully light touch with langauge -- never awkward. Her literary references land as fun, mind-expanding, rather than reminder's of the author's education.<br />And, yes, reading a book with this much love in it can change your life. I am more likely now to go ahead and order dessert when I see pie on the menu, and I am more likely to stop in a small, independent restaurant where I might find pie. Just last week, I got to tell an Austin chef how good her pie is. She glowed. My husband just sat back, smiled, and watched the two of us share our passion for pie. As soon as you start talking pie with someone, you're not strangers anymore.	2003-10-03

I did. I loved \\"Jane Eyre\\" and my reading interests include science fiction, fantasy and romance, so I am likely an ideal reader for \\"Jenna Starborn.\\" I was interested but never profoundly moved. I finished \\"Jenna Starborn\\" and would not rate it as a waste of time, but found it more engaging as an academic exercise than as a novel-reading experience.<br />Sharon Shinn must truly love \\"Jane Eyre\\" to have recreated it this way, but this version never quite comes to life. I think some of the most interesting elements have to do with the very stratified society she envisions. \\"Jane Eyre\\" was set in such a world, and there could indeed be a version again. I'd have liked to see a book or story that pursued that idea further, even at the expense of dropping the original premise of recreating the Jane Eyre plot in the future.<br />If you have never read \\"Jane Eyre,\\" this book will likely frustrate you, as many elements are included in order to create the parallel rather than because this world and these characters demand them.<br />Fans of hard core science fiction fans should not look to \\"Jenna Starborn\\" for science-based speculation. The science is minimal and the book has little enthusiasm for it.<br />This was my first outing with this author, and I suspect she has done better. Flawed though this book was, I enjoyed myself enough that I will certainly try her again!	2003-10-03

The plot even managed to surpise me (more than once).<br />You do not need to be a fan of the TV show to enjoy the book. You don't even need to have seen it once. Max Allan Collins tells you all you need to know. This is a very enjoyable mystery in the tradition of great pulp writers like Raymond Chandler.<br />Fans of the TV shows may be delighted to notice that he has the CSI Florida team talk to the CSI Sin City (Las Vegas) team. It's all one world. I don't know if that kind of &quot;crosstalk&quot; has happened in the TV shows. (Pardon my ignorance!) As someone who had read and enjoyed a CSI Las Vegas novel, I was delighted.<br />Both CSI fans and mystery fans should love this book! Enjoy!	2003-10-03

I picked this up at a local bookstore one afternoon when I was in the mood for fantasy, and looking for something not too weighty (in either sense of the word)! Dragon Blood delivered exactly what I was looking for. It is lightweight and fun -- a great read if you just want to escape.<br />Though not particularly groundbreaking, Dragon Blood didn't have anything about it that was overtly derivative -- no deja vu moments from McCaffrey or Tolkein, for example. Briggs has created a world and characters that genuinely interest me.<br />Another thing to note is that this book stands on its own. It is her second book in this world, but there is nothing in the book that requires you to read the first. I usually like to read a series in order, but my local store was out of the first (Dragon Bones). Dragon Blood gave me all the background I needed.<br />It was such a great read that I passed it on to a fellow reader. She enjoyed it as much as I did.<br />Dragon Bones is a light, delightful, quick read! Give this new author a try!	2003-08-07

Unraveling the strands of a decades-old secret takes our heroine, Lee, on an ever-more exciting journey across the country. It is also a voyage of self-discovery.  Lee starts off as a not-quite college graduate, a few hours short after four years of shifting from major to major.  In a family of overachievers, she is the disappointment.  In the course of &quot;Skeletons,&quot; she discovers herself as not just competent, but gifted.	2003-07-25

This one came with recommendations from Stanley Schmidt and Connie Willis, so I had to give it a try.<br />Levinson is still new at writing novels, and it occasionally shows.  I sometimes wanted a section to move faster, and occasionally felt that the dialog dragged a bit. Overall, it was was too interesting to put down.
