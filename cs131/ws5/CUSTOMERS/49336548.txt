This novel works so well in so many ways, it's hard to know where to begin praising it.  Maybe the first sentence is a good place to start:  <br /> <br />\\"Dela had mysterious dreams the night before she bought the riddle box.\\"   <br /> <br />As tough as it is to write a great opening line, lots of writers can do it.  But not many can make it pay off. <br />In just twelve words, Marjorie M. Liu makes a promise to the reader.  It's a promise that the novel will take you on an adventure full of mystery, suspense, excitement and romance.  And Liu knows how to deliver. <br /> <br />Tiger Eye is an engaging, exciting read for two reasons: <br /> <br />First, the author knows her characters inside and out.  She's taken the time to let them speak to her and make themselves known.  They're true both to themselves and the story.  And we care about them.  <br /> <br />Second, Liu is a very smart writer.  The novel flows with crisp dialogue, wonderful descriptions and a great story that you won't want to put down.  So go ahead, buy it now.         <br />	2005-03-11

That is certainly true of NEBULA AWARDS 33.  Sure, you might find one or two that you don't care for, but those stories are probably the exception to the rule.  Out of the works selected for inclusion in this volume, I found six of them to be outstanding, with a couple of them blowing me away.<BR>The SF stories that I enjoy the most teach me about myself and the world around me.  These stories did that and more.  <br />James Patrick Kelly's \\"Itsy Bitsy Spider\\" is a touching, thought-provoking look at our relationships with our children and our parents.  \\"The Flowers of Aulit Prison\\" by Nancy Kress is immediately readable, enjoyable, and yet full of depth.  With a title like \\"Three Hearings on the Existence of Snakes in the Human Bloodstream,\\" you know you're NOT in store for a boring read!  A masterful look at the battle between science and religion.  Michael Swanwick's \\"The Dead\\" is a wonderfully disturbing look at the corporate world.  And what can you say about Karen Joy Fowler's \\"The Elizabeth Complex,\\" except that it's brilliant?  (Man, this woman can write!)  <br />To end the volume, Willis hits a home run by picking Grand Master Poul Anderson's \\"The Martyr,\\" a story that I just can't stop thinking about.    <br />270 pages	2003-12-31

If all you remember from history class is \\"his rotundity,\\" you missed the boat on one of our greatest, most influential presidents.  <br />JOHN ADAMS proves that history doesn't have to be boring.  McCullough is a masterful storyteller, dropping us into the action on Page 1 with a scene any expert novelist would envy.  Here is Adams, mounted on his horse, about to ride through a harsh winter to an event that would forever change the course of American life and liberty.  And it only gets more exciting from there.<br />Before the publication of this wonderful biography, Adams was largely forgotten in the grand scope of American history.  That's all changed.  McCullough has shown us that Adams was either present or highly influential at nearly every important event in early American history.  Whether we realize it or not, Adams' presence continues to influence our country.  <BR> <BR>I can't tell you what a great time I had with this book.  Every topic covered - Adams and his family, his relationship with Jefferson, his diplomatic career, his views on France and Holland, his early law practice, his presidency, his final days -they're all handled in expert fashion.  Not to be missed.	2003-12-30

Sound farfetched?  It's not. <br />Winchester asks some fascinating questions and also speculates on some extraordinary theories.  For instance, did all of Earth's continents originally come from one land mass?  Can any area of land that undergoes such a catastrophe as Krakatoa did experience regeneration in just a few months?  And can the political turmoil of that part of the world during that time REALLY be \\"blamed\\" on the eruption of the volcano?  <br />Winchester is a rarity:  A scientist who is also a pretty good storyteller.  I always appreciate a scientist who can explain any science (geology, in this case) so that the general reader can understand what's going on.  Readers who exercise a little patience will find that the science behind Krakatoa's eruption is indeed approachable and interesting.  <br />Several critics have accused Winchester of not writing strictly about the volcano and it's eruption.  Many believe that much of the book has nothing to do with Krakatoa itself.  I disagree.  Everything in the book is about Krakatoa.  Winchester is obligated to discuss both what brought about the eruption and the consequences of it.  Readers who don't want to read about those aspects of the event are like kids who want to hear about July 4, 1776, but don't care anything about the events leading up to the date or its ramifications.  <br />I will agree that Winchester does sometimes get a little long-winded and sluggish in relating the details of the story.  But, I chalk that up to a writer who is truly enthusiastic about his subject.  Why can't all writers act like that?	2003-12-23

Was it accident, murder, or suicide?  There was only one witness - the family dog. <br />Linguist Paul Iverson, the husband of the deceased woman, narrates the story, giving his thoughts as to what might have happened.  While trying to solve the mystery, Paul also gives us background on how he and the woman met and married, describing their relationship's highs and lows.  Then odd things begin to happen to Paul...letters from prison...strange phone calls...<br />THE DOGS OF BABEL is Carolyn Parkhurst's first novel.  I hesitate to be too critical (especially since I'm about to finish my own first novel), but I will say that Parkhurst is an excellent writer.  Her descriptions, characters, atmosphere are right on target.  For me, the problems are only two: 1 - Parkhurst simply tries to cram too many ideas (although they are great ideas) into one book.  There are easily enough ideas here to sustain two books.  Confining them to one means that the important elements of the story either don't get the attention they need or they lose significance.  2 - The payoff didn't work for me.  It may work for other readers, and it obviously has for some, but I couldn't buy into it.  Parkhurst sets up a very difficult premise in the first chapter, one that's tough to deliver upon without descending into absurdity.  The solution is not absurd, but it's also not entirely satisfying either, based on the original premise.  <br />THE DOGS OF BABEL is both an entertaining read and a page-turner.  Although I wasn't wild about the book, Parkhurst's writing is certainly good enough to make me want to read her next book.	2003-12-11

CROSSFIRE certainly fits that description.<br />A large, diverse human colony has settled on a distant planet, only to find that their new world is inhabited.  To their relief, leader Jake Holman and his team discover that the aliens are primitive and passive.  It also seems that the aliens aren't native to the planet.  As he investigates further, Jake uncovers some startling truths about the aliens, the members of his team, and himself.  But he has more immediate concerns: trying to stop an interstellar war.<br />I once heard Orson Scott Card say that good science fiction isn't about the future, it's about the present.  In CROSSFIRE, Kress tackles moral issues with an expert hand.  This novel is about rights, strained relationships, standing up for truth, sacrifice, redemption, and many more complex issues that we face today.  Kress never writes with a heavy hand, but she always gives the reader plenty to think about in the midst of a great tale.<br />Highly recommended.<br />364 pages	2003-12-05

Not many people in my life do, but she does, even though I've never met her.  She understands that not only do book fanatics have to have at least one book in their hands at all times, but that it must be the RIGHT book for the right time.  <br />Nelson took on the task of reading one book a week for a year and writing about the experience.  She read a little bit of everything: biographies, novels, children's books, classics, and more.  The most interesting aspect of  SO MANY BOOKS is not the books themselves that Nelson chose, but how she selected them and how they were the right books at the right time.  <br />Have you ever put on a CD only to take it out before the first song was finished, knowing that you weren't in the right mood for that particular music/artist?  Or hit STOP on a movie that you rented, knowing that you weren't in the proper frame of mind for it?  Sara Nelson understands.  She also latches onto books that connect in some way with what she's going through at a particular moment.  Her chapter on how A MILLION LITTLE PIECES relates to a fight she had with her husband is revealing and priceless.

I imagine the first one was the most difficult to write, since it contains so much and is the foundation for the other four books.  Cooper does a masterful job of creating believable characters that we care about, then placing them in suspenseful, dangerous situations.  This is a wonderful book that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys suspense stories.  Once you finish the book (which you will quickly), youll want to jump right into the next book in the series, The Dark is Rising.  Highly recommended.	2003-11-14

It's a camp for boys, but Stanley's not very happy about it: It's actually a correctional facility in the Texas desert.  \\"If you take a bad boy and make him dig a hole every day in the hot son, it will turn him into a good boy,\\" say the camp \\"counselors.\\"  Stanley's not convinced.<br />Stanley IS convinced, however, that he's not bad, but cursed, as are all the men in the Yelnats family, dating back to his great-great grandfather.  Unfortunately, Stanley sees no way out of the curse or Camp Green Lake.  But there's something strange going on with all these holes the boys have to dig...<br />`Holes' is an incredible book with a simple, yet complex story construction.

As I watched the news coverage, my heart went out to those people.  We didn't know then what really happened on board Flight 93, what made the plane crash into a field in Shanksville, PA instead of the White House or the Capitol.  After reading `Among the Heroes,' I felt that I had a clearer picture of the course of events and the acts of bravery that the passengers exhibited.  But even if we never know exactly what happened on board, we now feel we know these people, thanks to Longman.<br />Through interviews with family and friends, Longman gives the reader a look into the lives of the passengers on Flight 93.  In most cases, they were people just like you and me - people who had jobs, families, and friends.  They had plans, dreams, and courage.  They weren't perfect.  Like all of us, they had their faults.  But they weren't about to sit back and let the ends of their lives be dictated by terrorists.  <br />This is a gripping, honest, account of one part of the most terrible day in our history.  Yet, it is also a tribute to the spirit of liberty that each of these bold Americans exhibited on that awful day.  Forget movie celebrities, rock stars, and professional athletes.  The passengers on Flight 93 redefine what the word hero means.  There is no higher standard than the one they set.  Let us honor them and never forget.<br />280 pages	2003-11-06

So many people have forgotten the basic fundamentals of friendship and hospitality.  We like to think we're friends to many and hospitable as well, but are we really?  Wilkins calls us to examine the nature of biblical friendship and hospitality, both of which are sadly lacking in 21st century America.  <br />Are our shortcomings in these areas due to dysfunctional families, fear of having people in our homes, or just wanting to be alone?  Wilkins shows us that God created His people to be true friends, not superficial acquaintances who say \\"good morning\\" as we walk out to pick up the newspaper.  And hospitality doesn't necessarily mean hosting a catered five-course dinner.  Far too many of us have departed from the pleasure and enjoyment that God intended for His people as defined in the Scriptures.  This book goes a long way in seeking to right such wrongs.

Or possibly, `WHAT to Read and Why.'  As it stands, `How to Read and Why' is excruciatingly inappropriate for what Bloom sets forth.<br />Bloom asserts in his preface that his book teaches HOW to read and why.  The word \\"how\\" presupposes that the reader requires instruction in beginning to read, in this case, some of the Western world's greatest literature.  Anyone who is new to great literature certainly needs help in how to read it.  Such a reader requires assistance in literary devices, content, historical significance, cultural influences, etc. inherent in the works.  That type of foundation will help teach you HOW to read.  Bloom gives no such help.  Rather, he tells you WHAT to read, and why it should be read.  (He also assumes that the reader comes to the table with an already vast knowledge of literature and \\"how\\" to read it.)<br />Even if Bloom changed his title to `What to Read and Why,' he might as well call it, `Shakespeare is All You Need,' or `How to Read Shakespeare into All the Great Masterpieces of World Literature.'  Sure, Shakespeare was profoundly influential (and continues to be) in the realm of literature, no one would deny that.  But to CONSTANTLY compare every author and every piece of writing to Shakespeare is like telling a child, \\"That's good, Johnny, but you'll never be as good as your big brother, you know that, don't you?\\"  Even Shakespeare himself would have to grow tired of all the adoration spewed out by Bloom.  Enough already.  <br />Don't get me wrong - Bloom is obviously a genius.  Anyone who read (and understood) Blake, Tennyson, and Browning at age eight, knows a thing or two.  Bloom gives the reader prime examples of great literature.  He just doesn't tell you HOW to read them; he tells you WHY.  <br />Another reviewer hit the nail on the head:  Take the list of works that Bloom suggests, and read them for yourself.  Try to find out something about them: the time they were written, the literary devices they use, the cultural and societal influences, the authors who wrote them.  The more you discover, the more you will enjoy and appreciate these masterpieces.  <br />283 pages	2003-10-31

Brooks addresses the general and the specific, teaching writers how to avoid some of the biggest blunders while growing and developing into a writer of more depth.  <br />Brooks had a very interesting beginning.  He was a lawyer for several years, yet when he decided to write, he wasn't interested in becoming a legal thriller writer like Grisham or Turow.  He settled on fantasy.  (By the way, Brooks advises that you write in as many genres as possible until you determine which genre is for you.)  His first book, `The Sword of Shannara,' made publishing history by becoming the first trade paperback to make the New York Times Bestseller list.  So it was a bed of roses for Brooks from that point on, right?  Hardly.  <br />`Sometimes the Magic Works' is valuable for the writing advice, but also for a glimpse into the writer's life and the journey that Brooks has taken.  Readers will see Brooks as a passionate writer and a dedicated family man.  (Yes, you CAN be both!)  This is a book that all writers, regardless of their genre, will want to read. <br />197 pages	2003-10-30

His writing is always informative, insightful, and downright funny.  You can't help but like him.  If you're discovering Bryson for the first time, `A Walk in the Woods' is a great place to start.<br />Bryson spent 20 years in Great Britain, working for a couple of newspapers.  When he returned to the U.S., he thought, \\"Hey, what better way to reunite with America than by hiking the (gulp) 2,000+ mile Appalachian Trail?\\"  And so the journey begins.  <br />Just reading about the equipment store was enough to make me never want to hike the A.P., but I sure wanted to see what adventures Bryson would encounter.  And oh boy, WHAT adventures!  First, Bryson is delighted when he discovers that he won't have to hike alone - his old buddy Stephen Katz is going to join him.  Only Katz is in about the same shape as the Pillsbury Dough Boy (with about the same eating habits).  Will Katz be able to keep up on the trail without a steady diet of Snickers bars and cream soda?  Ah, but the toils of the trail are just beginning...I won't spoil it for you, but I can promise you that the adventures of Bryson and Katz will leave you howling.  <br />Bryson does a good job of balancing with adventures with scientific information and excursions into the state of American society.  (The trail will do that to you, apparently.)  While he does bring out some interesting observations and provide readers with entertaining supplements to our long forgotten science classes, I found the scientific information to go on a bit too long.  I was more interesting in what was about to happen to Bryson and Katz along the trail.  <br />After reading `A Walk in the Woods,' would I hike the A.P. Trail?  No way.  Would I read another Bryson book?  You bet.  When do we leave?<br />274 pages	2003-10-24

It's not long before the Kranks become public enemies Nos. 1 &amp; 2 on Hemlock Street.<br />Grisham, to his credit, has produced a good look at the insanity of the holiday season and how it affects us all.  He does cleverly expose our crazy holiday thinking, our commercialism, and our lack of recognizing the true meaning of the holiday.  But I wish the book had been a little more hard-hitting and a little less \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\"-ish.  Even so, `Skipping Christmas' is an enjoyable way to spend a couple of sane hours before the mad dash begins.<br /><br />177 pages	2003-10-20

But Stephanie Plum is a cute, spunky monster who's scared, fearless, independent, vulnerable, sexy, smart, ditzy, sophisticated, goofy, and a whole pizza box full of contradictions.  But she's a lot of fun.<br />Stephanie's a New Jersey girl who's out of work and short on possibilities.  So she asks her cousin Vinny, a bail bondsman, for work.  Right off the bat, Steph decides to bring in Joe Morelli, a man nobody else has been able to haul in.  Of course, all she can see is the money it'll get her - $10,000.  <br />It's not quite as easy as she thinks.  Stephanie's Nova just barely moves, requiring a quart of oil every 15 minutes.  She doesn't have a clue about using a gun, tracking FTAs (Failed to Appear), or how to apprehend one if she finds one.  Plus a boxer is determined to inflict a little torture on Stephanie...just for fun.<br />Evanovich's first Stephanie Plum novel does a great job of introducing readers to Stephanie, her wacky family, friends, and life in New Jersey.  Quirky, funny, and always entertaining, Evanovich has successfully kept the thrill in thrillers, the mystery in mysteries, and the fun in following a character we can really root for.	2003-10-20

She had written and spoken with sometimes brutal honesty on actors, directors, and all types of movies.  Kael didn't really care who she offended or upset.  It's not like she tried to offend or upset, she just called them as she saw them.  She unflinchingly says of Stanley Kubrick's `Eyes Wide Shut,' \\"It was ludicrous from the word go.\\"  She calls Spielberg \\"uninteresting\\" and melodramatic.  <br />But she also handed out glorious praise when it was due, especially when other critics were ignoring good films and performances.  She states that \\"Paul Mazursky hasn't been given his due,\\" and that actresses such as Debra Winger have been wrongfully overlooked.  Kael mentions several wonderful films that have all but fallen into obscurity, all because most critics are afraid to take a stand and swim upstream against the tide of their colleagues.<br />If the book concerned film criticism only, it would be worth purchasing.  But interviewer Francis Davis also asks Kael to address writing, her days at The New Yorker, television, and the reason why so many awful films are made these days.  `Afterglow' is a fascinating look into the thoughts of Pauline Kael, but it's far, far too short at 126 pages.	2003-10-10

That makes a huge difference.  Lukeman is telling us what he sees on a daily basis and how to elevate your work from the bottom of the slush pile.  <br />The book does a great job of explaining the problems most manuscripts contain, then tells you how to fix them, THEN offers exercises to help you overcome the problem.  After working through just one exercise, I felt like my writing took a major leap forward.  I think the book will do the same for all serious writers willing to devote a little time to this valuable book.<br />206 pages	2003-10-08

Some of them are very good.  But the stories that open and close the collection are great.<br />Rendell has the ability to put people in strange situations and make us feel what they feel: danger, fear, panic, disgust, or just plain unease.  Her stories have a sense of justice.  We see someone doing something they shouldn't and a part of us wants justice.  Rendell knows how to write such a story and make it thoroughly satisfying.<br />The title story focuses on a young man named Ribbon.  Ribbon is well-off, not filthy rich, but well-off.  He spends his time reading novels, examining their grammatical and factual inaccuracies, and writing letters to the publishers and authors involved.  He's the original literary snob (and a real jerk).  But who can blame him?  His mother taught him this behavior, after all.  Ah, but she's no longer with Ribbon.  And when a book by a despised author takes on a life of its own, Ribbon doesn't know where to turn.  But it's silly to be harassed by a book...isn't it?<br />The final story, \\"High Mysterious Union,\\" is a story that works on many levels.  It's a great story, but it also speaks to our society and how we view culture, community, and sex.  Ben is a writer who stays in a friend's cottage in a British village to work on a manuscript.  Ben becomes obsessed with one of the local girls, a young local girl.  Ben's almost old enough to be her father.  You might think this is a typical Lolita-type story, but you soon realize that's not it at all.  It's an amazing story, one of those that stays with you long after you've finished reading it.	2003-10-03

I remember it well - I live there.  Like millions of others, I watched the news reports on TV and listened to them on radio.  We all breathed a huge sigh of relief when the two snipers were captured.  And many millions of people wanted to know more.  Who were these people?  What were their backgrounds?  What motivated them?  What was it like behind the scenes for the law enforcement officials involved?<br />Those hoping for detailed accounts in any of the above mentioned areas are likely to be disappointed.  `Sniper' does succeed in taking the reader inside the manhunt for the snipers, as the cover states, but only on a very basic level.  The book is only slightly over 200 pages long.  That's hardly enough space to go into much detail.<br />Readers will get a general idea of who the two snipers were before they began their reign of terror, but it's not enough.  Their backgrounds are only given a superficial treatment and we're told very few facts by the people who knew them.  As far as what motivated them to do the things they did?  Again, we get a general picture, but that's the problem: it's too general.  Readers want to understand what made these monsters kill.  They want to see the progressions in their lives that brought on these events.<br />The police procedures are examined in somewhat better detail, but I could have used more.  This was the most harrowing, yet fascinating criminal case in years, but we're not really made to feel the terror, we're not made to feel the tension as evidence is gathered, and we're not presented with enough of the frustration the investigators experienced.  Sure, we all know that there was friction between federal, state, and local officials, but what was its genesis?  And what about the media?  No attempt was made to explain how all the media leaks happened, only that they did happen.<br />For what it is, a generalsummary of what happened, but book does a good job.  If that was the primary focus of the book, it succeeded.  But I wish the book had gone into more detail in all areas.  I think other readers will feel the same way.<br />238 pages - 16 pages of black and white photos (nothing graphic)	2003-09-30

Dr. David Beck and his wife Elizabeth have been participating in a ritual for years: Each year, they return to the tree where together they carved their initials as kids.  During one celebration, Beck is beaten up and Elizabeth vanishes.  <br />Eight years pass.  Elizabeth's body has been found, her murderer has been jailed, and Beck has tried to get on with his life.  It hasn't been easy, and it sure doesn't get any easier when Beck gets an email from a person who seems to know things that only Elizabeth could know.  Now if he could only find her.  That might be difficult: The police have uncovered evidence that Beck might have had something to do with Elizabeth's death.  But they're not the only ones after him.<br />With `Tell No One,' Harlan Coben has established himself as one of the genre's top mystery writers.  And while I think his next book `Gone for Good' is a better book, `Tell No One' delivers mystery, suspense, action, thrills, deception, and danger on a very high level.  I had a few quibbles here and there with some of the characters and their motivations, but the story was gripping and made me turn the pages at a pretty good rate.  If you haven't tried Coben, `Tell No One' is a good place to start.  You certainly won't be bored.  Tell everyone.	2003-09-24

He thought things through first (which many others did too), but then he added an element that many other sf writers didn't (and some STILL don't): humanity.<br />Dan Davis, an inventor, narrates the story.  He's a brilliant inventor and has come up with some pretty amazing gadgets, including Hired Girl, a robot who cleans, sweeps, vacuums, mops, and generally works all day long without supervision.  Dan's problems begin mounting when he learns he's been betrayed by his partner.  And to add insult to injury, Dan's fiancée is in on the betrayal as well.  As if betrayal alone isn't enough, the two conspirators have Dan placed into a 30-year suspended animation.  Dan wakes up 30 years later and is focused on one thing: revenge.  <br />Now lots of authors could have taken the above premise and come up with an entertaining story.  Heinlein did this and much more.  He shows us that change (for individuals and for all humanity) is difficult, but not impossible.  The future is full of challenges, but no matter how much technology changes, no matter how much language, currency, and trends change, man's basic instincts and attitudes remain constant.<br />Heinlein also tackles the implications of time travel better than anyone else from this period.  (The book first appeared in 1957.)  The problem of time travel is well thought out and logical.  (Wish you could say that about every time travel story.)  If you haven't read Heinlein, or if all you've read is `Stranger in a Strange Land,' `Starship Troopers,' or `The Moon is a Harsh Mistress' (all great books), treat yourself to a fun, intelligent read from one of the true masters.	2003-09-22

He thinks logically, understands extremely difficult math concepts, hates the colors brown and yellow, dislikes being touched, and knows every prime number up to 7,057.  He's also autistic.  <br />Christopher relates to animals much better than he does to humans.  So when he discovers that a neighbor's dog has been killed with a garden fork, Christopher is naturally upset.  So this very unusual young man - who is afraid of strangers and unfamiliar places - sets out to find the dog's killer.  In doing so, he makes some discoveries that will be very unsettling. <br />Author Mark Haddon has written a very original novel, narrated by Christopher.  We see the world through this very special boy's eyes.  The way that Christopher tries to make sense and order of the world makes him a narrator like no other we have ever encountered in literature.  The novel works so well because the character of Christopher is so well drawn and his problems (and attempts at solving them) are honest, real, and touching.  Highly recommended.  <br />221 pages	2003-09-21

Then I think of never giving up, always taking advantage of each day's opportunities, and being truly thankful for each breath I take.  That was the Walter Payton way of living.<br />Most of the book is penned by Payton, but several parts are written by members of his family as well as friends and coaches, such as Matt Suey and Mike Ditka.  Walter's entire life is represented here, from his early days in Columbia, Mississippi to the Chicago Bears to the illness that led to his death at such a young age.  To say that the story is inspiring is like saying the sun is a pretty good light.  This is one of the most inspiring books I have read in a long, long time.  It will have an effect on all who read it.  You don't have to be a football fan to appreciate and enjoy the book.  Just a regular, ordinary person - that's the way Walter saw himself.  <br />After you've finished the book, don't be surprised if you start looking at life differently.  You might start thinking more positively.  You might start spending more time on things that really matter: your family, your friends, helping other people.  Like I said, don't be surprised.  <br />Walter Payton was a class act in every way imaginable.  If you don't believe it, look at most of the guys playing pro football today.  How many of them are in it for the team and not for themselves?  How many of them credit the people around them and not themselves?  How many of them praise others' ability and not their own?  How many of them can stay out of trouble and avoid scandal?  Today's players could learn a lot from Walter Payton.  So could regular people like you and me.  Thank goodness God was pleased to send us Walter Payton.  Read the book and you'll understand how special the man was and how he continues to bless lives after his death.  A must-read.	2003-09-18

After all, perfectionists try with all their might to do everything correctly in the most efficient way.  Are we wrong to admire them?  Shouldn't we try to emulate them?  <br />If you are a perfectionist, you know that the desire to be perfect becomes an exercise in futility; you're never good enough no matter what you do.  You can work harder, longer, smarter - it's just not enough.  Dr. Basco's book first helps you determine if you actually are a perfectionist.  After taking the self-assessment, I discovered I was a full-fledged perfectionist.  And in my case, it was impacting my life in a negative way.  <br />Part of the problem with perfectionists goes back to their early beliefs and expectations.  Basco shows how these early thoughts influence us to become perfectionists.  She also shows how uncontrolled perfectionism can destroy relationships at every level.  Uncontrolled, it can ruin lives.  <br />That's why this book is so valuable.  The author shows perfectionists how to begin the road to recovery, and how to stay on it.  If perfectionism is influencing your life and those around you in a negative or hurtful way, you must read this book.  I'm thankful I found it.  It has made a huge difference.  <br />263 pages	2003-09-04

As you can imagine, several of them ask, \\"What do you have that's like Harry Potter?\\"  I always recommend E. Nesbit's books.  They never know who I'm talking about.  But they usually become interested very quickly.<br />Edith Nesbit was an outspoken British writer who wrote enormously entertaining children?s books in her later years.  Many of these books combine normal, everyday children with magical themes or elements.  In 'The Enchanted Castle,' three children - Gerald, Cathy, and Jimmy - stumble upon a lush, beautiful garden, where they find a princess who has been asleep for 100 years.  Or is she really who she says she is?  All the children know is that something strange is going on - like why are the statues moving?<br />'The Enchanted Castle' IS enchanting.  The writing is colorful, exciting, and engaging.  If your child is looking for something in the Harry Potter vein, the E. Nesbit books are just what the doctor ordered.  Kids won't even care that it was written nearly 100 years ago.  It still reads pretty well today, and that's what counts.<br />291 pages	2003-09-03

They didn't make it to WorldCon, but they did make it to Wall Hollow, Tennessee, where all the members each wrote a story and buried it in a time capsule.<br />30 years later, several of the members of the group have hit it big as SF writers.  Their reunion at Wall Hollow becomes a huge media event, with publishers bidding on the rights to the stories buried in the time capsule.  But just before the reunion starts, someone is murdered.  <br />`Zombies of the Gene Pool' is an entertaining book which includes well-drawn, quirky characters straight out of the science fiction world.  McCrumb's writing and characterization are right on target.  The payoff, for me, wasn't as satisfying as the journey, which in itself was quite fun.  Fans of science fiction will enjoy this humorous, sometimes bittersweet look at the world of science fiction authors.	2003-08-30

Were they \\"invented\\" by someone else's imagination?  Why did they just suddenly appear?  Ambrose asks some difficult questions and places himself in some very difficult situations for a writer, but he's definitely up to handling each challenge.  Ambrose is a master craftsman.

Does the term even come close to fitting Louis Armstrong?  Absolutely.  If you have any doubt as to Armstrong's place in music history, pick up this book and dive in.  Giddins embraces not only the talent and genius of Armstrong, but also the humor, warmth, and generosity of the man.  `Satchmo' is not so much a biography of the jazz pioneer as it is a celebration of the man's gift to the world: his music.  <br />Giddins follows Armstrong's early days in New Orleans to his final days of touring and recording.  The book focuses heavily on Armstrong's music, but readers won't need a degree in music to understand what Giddins is saying.  The author quotes copiously from Armstrong himself, giving us an in-depth look at who Armstrong was and how he thought about music, race relations, friends, wives, and his philosophy on life.<br />`Satchmo' is a perfect introduction to the wonderful world of Louis Armstrong.  If you want to know if a piece of non-fiction works, ask yourself after reading if you'd like to learn more about the subject.  I warn you - after reading `Satchmo' you'll want to read more AND listen to each recording mentioned by Giddins...over and over and over.  And you'll do it.  And the songs won't ever grow stale.  And you'll hear something different each time.  That's the sign of genius.  <br />190 pages	2003-08-25

The book has received much publicity from many of places.  But unfortunately, many people still think the book is for women (particularly single women) only.  Nothing could be further from the truth.<br />The whole premise of `The Gift of Fear' is that each of us has a little voice inside of us that warns us of danger from others.  Animals have it too.  But unlike animals, we often seek to suppress our warning signals, thinking \\"This guy's harmless, what am I thinking?\\" or \\"He's just asking to come inside for a glass of water.  What's the harm in that?\\" or \\"I can't ignore him.  That would be rude.  I don't want to appear rude.\\"  <br />Every day people ignore the danger signals that are given off in response to those who mean to do us harm.  De Becker shows us how and why this happens.  The situations are endless:  robbers, thieves, stalkers, disgruntled employees, former lovers/friends, even murderers.  De Becker tells us how to recognize the danger signals and how NOT to ignore them.  He also tells us how to deal with people who could endanger us, how to put a stop to threats, and why most restraining orders not only don't work, but usually work to the detriment of the one requesting the order.  <br />Yes, this is an extremely important book for all women to read, but don't stop there.  Every man and woman should this book, especially if you have a family.  Reading `The Gift of Fear' will not guarantee that you will be completely free from danger for the rest of your life, it goes an awful long way towards that goal.  Very highly recommended.	2003-08-12

You could say it's a simple \\"good vs. evil\\" story between the good, honorable mice of Redwall Abbey and the evil forces of Cluny the one-eyed rat, but that would be an oversimplification.  It's much more, largely in part to Brian Jacques and his skillful writing.  <br />As I was reading 'Redwall,' I realized that this book is the perfect transition between young adult and adult literature.  If your child is bored with most of the books written for his level, but maybe is not quite ready for one of the heavies, 'Redwall' may be the answer.  Jacques tells a very approachable story with a language that will be challenging for some younger readers, but not beyond their reach.  His descriptions and characters are painted with more depth than the average young person's book, but the fun and excitement are retained.  Jacques is to be applauded.  <br />If your child enjoys fantasy stories and is not quite ready for Tolkien, 'Redwall' is the perfect transition book/series.  Enjoy.  <br />350 pages	2003-07-29

But it's more complicated than that.  Carmel Loan, a top Minneapolis lawyer has become buddy-buddy with the hit-woman and may have found a new way to unwind from the pressures of the high-stakes lawyer game.  <br />'Certain Prey' is my first exposure to Sandford and I can say that he really delivers on creating action, suspense, and excitement.  And his villains are well-drawn.  Even the minor characters are done admirably.  <br />But I have two problems with 'Certain Prey.'  One is this: Sandford is a good writer and has written a smart story with smart criminals.  Why then in critical moments do the criminals behave so stupidly?  I won't give it away for those who haven't read this installment, but Sandford really asks the reader to make a couple of pretty bold leaps with him as far as characters.  Again, if the characters hadn't been drawn so well, it wouldn't be such a problem to see them behave in an inconsistent manner.  <br />The second problem: We don't know who Lucas Davenport is.  Sure, he's a cop, but he's the least fleshed-out character.  We don't know anything about his motivation (other than the fact that he's a cop) or what drives him.  I'm aware that I've come into the series at Book 10, but not every reader of 'Certain Prey' will start with Book 1.  More about Davenport would have been nice.<br />If graphic, sadistic violence and strong language offend you, this is not the book for you.  Just a friendly warning.  But if you like a fast-paced criminal thriller, 'Certain Prey' may be the book you're looking for.	2003-07-21

'From a Buick 8' is one of the best novels King has written in a long time.  If you'll bear with me, I'll tell you why.<br />The story involves the death of a Pennsylvania Trooper named Curt Wilcox.  Curt's son Ned is about to finish high school.  He takes a job with the police department, mainly to learn all he can about the death of his dad.  The cops take him in, show him the ropes, and tell him an out-of-this-world story involving his dad...and what APPEARS to be a Buick Roadster.  And as we've come to expect from King...strange things happen....<br />People who don't like King because of \\"monsters and gore\\" should enjoy this book.  It's more of a thinking person's book - it's not really flashy and it won't gross you out, but you'll remember the story, the characters, and the atmosphere much more than you would after reading 'Pet Sematary' or 'The Tommyknockers' or even 'It.'  What does King do differently in this book?<br />For one thing, his exploration of character has evolved into something far beyond the stuff of most horror novels.  Writers who want to know about characters and character motivation could do much worse than to study King.  'From a Buick 8' is not jammed with characters, but there are several and they're all satisfyingly well-drawn.<br />King's use of description and the atmosphere he creates have always been good, but they really serve his purposes here quite well.  You almost feel as if you are in Shed B with the Buick when these creepy events happens.  King has always been a very visual writer and that gift certainly comes through here.<br />In his best works, King addresses not only our fears, but our hopes and dreams as well.  'From a Buick 8' is part coming of age story, part self-discovery, and part self-examination.  The ending?  When you get there, you'll understand that it couldn't end any other way.  It's different and satisfying.  If you haven't read King in a long time, nowis the chance to give him another try.  Ignore the negative reviews from people who want to see monsters and gore on every page.  Judge for yourself.  (Just keep an eye out for '57 Buicks, though.)	2003-07-21

This marks the first time the trio has ventured into the future rather than the past, and some strange things happen.<br />Scieszka's stories have a great visual style, which lend themselves to some great illustrations in the book.

I can't tell you if James Gunn's `The Listeners' is better than `Contact' simply because I haven't read Carl Sagan's book.  But I have read Gunn's, and I can say that Sagan would have to have moved several planets in order to come close to the quality of `The Listeners.'  <br />Scientist Robert MacDonald is the director of \\"The Project,\\" a study of sounds coming from the stars.  MacDonald firmly believes that life is out there and that intelligent beings will eventually communicate with humans.  He and others like him have been listening for over 50 years, but they've heard only silence.  Until now.<br />A cryptic message arrives, but what does it mean?  With the threat of the project being shut down, MacDonald desperately seeks to keep his vision alive, but the cost is high.  <br />`The Listeners' is much more than just a \\"first contact\\" story.  The writing is excellent and the drama is far above what you would expect.  The more we learn about communicating with other beings, the more we find we don't know about communicating with each other.  An excellent read.  <br />240 pages	2003-07-18

I'm not so sure...<BR>It's true that 'The Terminal Man' is over 30 years old.  Many parts of the book show those 30 years, but surprisingly, the book holds up well.  Harry Benson has blackouts, during which he commits violent acts.  Of course he can't remember any of it.  Several research scientists believe that they can help Benson with the aid of computer technology.  They operate on Benson and all goes well...for awhile...<br />Crichton has a lot to say about man vs. computer and much of it is dated.  But in 1971, people were pretty uptight about where computers might take us.  (I guess some still are.)  Even though the book is dated in places, these are the things Crichton does well: Believable characters, good tension, believable and UNDERSTANDABLE science, and a plain ol' good story.  'The Terminal Man' is more than just a blast from the past, more than just a cute little relic from a time when we knew next to nothing about computers.  It's a legitimate thriller that still has a few thrills left.	2003-06-13

The first story, Not Quite Dead Enough, finds Archie in the Army while Wolfe and Fritz train for active duty.  (Really!  No kidding!)  While on furlough, Archie is suspected of murdering a young lady he had been out with for the evening.  The second story is far superior to the first.  Booby Trap, while keeping the trappings of a military atmosphere (an Army colonel is murdered), provides a satisfactory outlet for Wolfes genius.<br /><br />You must understand that these stories appeared first in 1944.  Stout was obviously painting Wolfe and Archie as patriotic crime fighters, which is admirable, but yields ridiculous results in the first story.  The second tale is vintage Wolfe, containing everything Wolfe fans have come to expect (beer, orchids, colorful exchanges between Wolfe and Archie) and love (a woman in the brownstone, Wolfe leaving the house, Wolfe riding in a car, Wolfe attempting to sit in an unsatisfactorily built chair).  If youre a die-hard fan, youll want to read the first story, but youll savor the second.  If youre a newcomer, skip the first tale and watch Wolfe in top form in Booby Trap.<br />208 pages	2003-05-26

That would be a mistake of monumental proportions.  `The Last Good Kiss' is a hard hitting, gritty, graphic hard-boiled novel about some pretty nasty people doing some pretty nasty things.  It's also exceptionally well written.<br />C.W. Sughrue, a Montana P.I., is hired to track down a drunken writer.  He finds his man, but along the way Sughrue takes another case, a case he knows will lead to nothing good.  His job is to find a girl who ran away from home many, many years ago.  The hunt for the girl leads Sughrue through a parade of despicable degenerates with no redeeming qualities.  <br />It can be a hard novel to read and a difficult one to forget.  In Sughrue, Crumley has created a detective who lives in a broken world, hoping that there might just be one good thing on the horizon, one good reason to live, one good thing to believe in.  The settings, characters, tone...it all works, establishing the novel as one of the greats in the hard-boiled mystery genre.  But again, if you are looking for a nice, cozy mystery to curl up with for a relaxing evening, this is not for you.  Definitely not for kids.      <br />244 hard-boiled pages	2003-05-22

I assumed the books were depressing, painful tales that would likely give kids nightmares and send them screaming to therapists.  So I read one...and I was wrong.<br />`The Bad Beginning' chronicles the misadventures of three very...well, unfortunate...orphans: fourteen year old Violet (who longs to invent things), twelve year old Klaus (who longs to read books), and the infant girl Sunny (who longs to bite things...and people).  As author Lemony Snicket warns on the book's back cover, this is \\"an unhappy tale about three very unlucky children.\\"  That it certainly is, but it is also much more. <br />The book can be viewed as a dark comedy for children, a fairy tale gone wrong, or Charles Dickens meets Harry Potter.  Snicket moves the story forward with a fast-paced plot and many vocabulary lessons inserted throughout the story in very clever ways.  <br />Many people may be critical of the Unfortunate Events books, citing that there are no happy endings.  But life doesn't always turn out nice and neat like it did in the Nancy Drew, Hardy Boys, and Little House on the Prairie books.  There's nothing wrong with those books, but maybe they're not your thing.  If that's the case, maybe the Unfortunate Events books will be more to your liking.	2003-05-20

Rowling has done what very few writers have done:  Created a series in which each book is better than the last.  (And the first one was pretty darn good!)  I haven't read the fourth book and nobody (as far as I know) has read the fifth, but I am confident that the best is yet to come.  <br />Right from the start, you get the feeling that Harry is about to go through some pretty serious changes.  He's thirteen now and is not going to take any stuff from anybody, especially not the Dursleys.  But Harry's new teenage confidence takes a hard hit when he discovers that Sirius Black, who was directly responsible for the death of Harry's parents, has escaped from Azkaban.  And he's headed for Hogwarts.  <br />Of course the entire gang is back: Friends Ron, Hermoine, Hagrid...enemies Malfoy, Snape...and a few new faces as well.  But will they be friendly, or not?  <br />The third Harry Potter installment, like the first two, is a very well written, entertaining book.  But in this book, Rowling addresses some very serious issues; loyalty, morality, death, and more.  The tone is darker and richer than in the previous books, making the reader wonder if this is really written for kids or adults?  Or both?  <br />If you've read the first two books, prepare yourself for something different, but something satisfying.  If you haven't, don't start here.  Start with the first one, move to the second one, then pull up a chair, sit down, and immerse yourself in `The Prisoner of Azkaban.'  <br />435 pages	2003-05-19

If you doubt it, read the first three pages and then try to put the book down.  (Heck, read just the FIRST page!)  Koontz has the ability to drop the reader directly into a situation that's impossible to turn away from.  In this tale, a young man named Dylan is traveling with his autistic younger brother Shep.  Dylan is abducted by a strange man who injects Dylan with a strange drug.  The man tells Dylan that the drug is his life's work and that Dylan will be changed; in what way, even the man doesn't know.  Then the man disappears...<br />Dylan and Shep meet a woman named Jillian, who has also been injected with the drug.  Together, they seek to outrun the armed men looking for the doctor and his latest creation.  But along the way, Dylan and Jillian discover that they now have strange powers...VERY strange powers.  And Shep...he's acting even more unusual than he normally does...And what does all this have to do with images of doves, a church, and ice?  You'll have to read the book to find out.<br />Koontz also has the ability to write likable characters that we feel like we've known all our lives.  The theme of the good guy (or girl) overcoming evil is certainly not new, but it takes on a whole new meaning after 9-11.  Koontz doesn't exploit that connection, but helps us understand through his characters how ordinary people can make a difference.  It's very refreshing, and in a way patriotic.  <br />But Koontz also has a good time with his story.  The first meeting and the initial exchanges between Dylan and Jillian are funny, natural, and right on target.  Unlike some other critics, I enjoyed the touches of humor.  Koontz mixes humor and danger like oil and water, but somehow manages a mixture that works.  <br />The weakness of the book?  Others have cited it: the ending.  I'll say only this: when you get there, you'll understand why it ends the way it does.  Is it satisfying?  In a way.  Could it have been better?  Probably.  But Koontz is the author, not me.  He knows what he's doing.  So sit down, strap yourself in for an exciting, strange ride.  Enjoy.<br />431 pages	2003-05-14

Eliot called `The Moonstone' \\"the first and greatest English detective novel.\\"  Is the novel worthy of such praise?  We shall see...  <br />The story begins with a brief prologue describing how the famous yellow diamond was captured during a military campaign in India by a British officer in 1799.  The action moves quickly to 1848 England, where, according to the British officer's will, the diamond has been given to one of the soldier's young relatives, Rachel Verinder.  Yet only hours after the diamond arrives at the Verinder estate, it disappears.  Was it stolen by a relative?  A servant?  And who are these three Indian men who keep hanging around the estate?   <br />`The Moonstone' is told from the point of view of several characters.  The first portion of the tale is told by Gabriel Betteredge, house steward of the Verinder estate, who has been working for the family practically his entire life.  Although over 200 pages, Betteredge's account holds the reader's interest as he introduces the main players and the crime itself.  The next account, by distant Verinder relative Miss Clack, is humorous and somewhat important, but far too long (nearly 100 pages) for its relevance to the story.  But after Miss Clack's account, things really take off at breakneck speed.  <br />Readers who latch onto the T.S. Eliot quote expecting a modern detective tale will be sorely disappointed.  You aren't going to see anything resembling Jeffrey Deaver, James Patterson, Sue Grafton, or even Mary Higgins Clark.  You also won't see Mickey Spillane, Dashiel Hammett, or Raymond Chandler.  Nor will you see Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers, or Martha Grimes.  You won't even see Arthur Conan Doyle.  But you WILL see the novel that influenced them all.  <br />You'll also see something else.  Something that modern mystery/detective writers have for the most part lost.  Characters.  Oh sure, modern writers have characters, but for the most part, the reader onlylearns enough about the character to forward the plot.  In our time, plot is King.  When `The Moonstone' was published (1868), one of the novel's attractions was its characters.  Collins has painted each of these characters so well that the reader feels that they know not only how they look, but their mannerisms, their movements, how they think, and their view of the world they live in.  That type of character development is seriously lacking today, not from all writers, but from far too many.  <br />Of course, the down side is that Colllins also took over 500 pages to develop those characters.  Is the book too long?  For most modern readers, the answer is yes.  I believe it all has to do with your expectation.  Put modern mystery/detective stories out of your head.  Then read `The Moonstone' as you would any other novel.  Get lost in the atmosphere and the characters.  Immerse yourself.  Most of all, enjoy.  Reading `The Moonstone' is like eating at a fine restaurant after months of fast food.  When it's over, you just want to sit back in your favorite chair and say, \\"It's nice to know that the finer things are still available.\\"  Yes they are.  Treat yourself to this gourmet book. <br />522 pages	2003-05-12

Lewis discovers that Uncle Jonathan is basically a nice guy, but a little weird.  And something about his house is weird too.  It's full of clocks, but one of them in particular keeps ticking...and ticking...and ticking...and no one knows where it is.  <br />`The House with a Clock in its Walls' is a genuinely creepy story with strange, likable characters.  Several humorous, light touches run throughout the book, but the scary scenes really deliver.  Any kid (or adult) who enjoys the Harry Potter books will find this book a welcome addition to their reading while they wait for the next J.K. Rowling outing.  Although the book is for both boys and girls, the book will especially attract boys who may not be interested in sports.

Easy is an African American WWII veteran from Texas, now living in 1948 L.A. where he proudly owns a modest home.  The home is all he has to be proud of since he got fired from his job at a defense plant.  Life for Easy is not easy at all.  Then one day, a white man dressed in a white suit offers Easy good money to locate a beautiful blonde known to hang out at black clubs.  For a man with a mortgage and no money coming in, the offer is too good to be true.  But then offers like this usually are.  <br />The plot sounds typical, but Mosley's writing is anything but.  Mosley paints a clear and atmospheric picture of racial segregation in post-war L.A., but that picture is not overexposed.  Easy not only has to endure the dangers of finding this girl, he must do it in a hostile background where white policemen and higher-ups look for any type of crime that they might pin on him.  The story of the transplanted man from the south living on the west coast is not unfamiliar, but making him a black man facing prejudice on every side makes the story more alive and the plot more tension-filled.  Again, this is not done in a heavy-handed way, but with a subtle touch that makes you want to turn the pages. <br />Mosley is very much at home with the hard-boiled style of crime noir and it shows on every page.  This is not a Hammett or Chandler re-hash.  This is a fresh, lively, exciting mystery from a very fine writer.  If you haven't experienced Mosley and Easy Rawlins, pick up the Blue Dress and try it on for size.  <br />215 pages	2003-05-05

They are obedient only to him.  It's simple; if they won't obey, he'll kill them.  Doro has the incredible ability to take over the bodies of others (thereby killing the host) even at a distance of many miles.  His power is immense.  But he meets in Anyanwu a formidable opponent.  (Or will she become a trusted friend?)  Anyanwu (who has also lived for hundreds of years) is a healer who is able to adapt her body to any living form - mammal, fish, bird, or another human.  Anyanwu's main concern is the safety of her children.  Doro's main concern is exploiting them as breeding stock.  Doro and Anyanwu certainly have different goals, but they each learn some hard lessons throughout the course of the book.  So do we.<br />Butler's characters and landscapes are so well drawn and so real that you really never think about the fact that you're reading science fiction.  In fact the term speculative fiction is really a better term for this story; there's very little science in the book, but there is a plethora of examinations of human nature (even if those humans live for hundreds of years).<br />Wild Seed is a completely absorbing, unforgettable book, made even more so by Butler's fascinating ability as a writer.

Just what is jazz?  Maybe it really is a question that can only be answered by the famous Louis Armstrong quote, \\"If you've gotta ask, you'll never know.\\"<br />But give Axelrod credit.  He gives the subject expert treatment.  Whether you know absolutely nothing about jazz (or any music, for that matter), or whether you have a degree in music, you'll learn plenty in this well-formatted book.<br />The author wisely gives readers a general overview of what constitutes jazz, what some of the major trends were, and a who's who of famous musicians.  Axelrod does NOT immediately launch into a chronological history of jazz and that's a plus.  Jazz does not have cut-and-dried periods.  It's style changes intertwine and sometimes reemerge after years (and decades) of inactivity.  After the first few chapters when Axelrod DOES get into more of a chronological look at jazz, it makes more sense.  The foundation he has built can withstand a look at the various subgenres at that point.  This makes for a much clearer reading and understanding of jazz.<br />Axelrod gives brief bios of the major players and band leaders.  If you want to know more, he tells you where you can continue your search.  Also very helpful is a listing of 25 \\"must have\\" recordings for the beginner, and an expanded list for those ready to branch out.  Also provided are glossaries of musicians and jazz terms.<br />Some critics have knocked the book for not providing a sampler CD.  Let me point out that the outstanding Ken Burns 5 CD boxed set covering the history of jazz barely scratches the surface.  A &quot;sampler&quot; CD just won't do.<br />A great book for the beginning, intermediate, or veteran jazz fan.<br />approx. 300 pages	2003-05-02

But it's not true...Elvis DOES live...in the pages of Guralnick's outstanding biography of Elvis Presley, a biography that will stand the test of time as the definitive study of the King of Rock n Roll. <br />In Volume One, Guralnick takes us from Elvis' humble beginnings in Tupelo, Mississippi to his departure for Army duty in Germany twenty-three years later. In between, readers will be fascinated with what they THOUGHT they knew about Elvis. LAST TRAIN differs from other books about Elvis in two very distinct ways: First, the author gives us first hand accounts from the people who were actually there. There's no tabloid journalism or second-hand anecdotes. Guralnick has done his research and it shows. Second, Elvis is never presented as an icon or an idol. Guralnick has the unique ability to step back away from the action as an impartial observer and give us an extraordinarily clear image of what Elvis was really like - a really nice, clean, religious kid who was consumed with music and making people happy.<br />You can almost feel the electricity of the recording sessions at Sun Studios. You can watch Sam Phillips as he realizes that this boy could change the course of popular music forever. Elvis' girls, friends, musicians...they're all here and they all have a piece of the story to tell. And what about the \\"Colonel\\" Tom Parker? Genius or huckster? <br />Of course, the hysteria is recorded as well. After all, it's part of the story. Crazed fans were nothing new. After all, girls had been going nuts over singers like Frank Sinatra and many others for years. But the world had never seen anything like this? How can you explain it? Guralnick never really comes right out with an explanation, but you'll be able to pick it up between the lines. But you'll enjoy the book so much in the process, all you'll care about is what happens next.<br />The writing, the storytelling, the descriptions...it's all outstanding. But if I had to pick two moments that really struck me,one would be Elvis near his popularity peak looking out of a train window. He saw a lone dog running in a field and longed for the freedom to roam the world unhindered by masses of admirers. It's a very simple, but powerful image of things to come. The other is the [end of life] of Elvis' mother near the end of the first volume. In one of the most heartbreaking scenes I've ever read, Elvis kneels beside his deceased mother's body, crying out that he would give up all of his success and go back to digging ditches if he could only have her back again. If you have dry eyes at the end of this book, your heart needs to be jumpstarted. <br />Like all good writers, Guralnick expertly foreshadows the tragic events that will take place in Volume Two. Even if you think you know the full Elvis story, you'll learn plenty by reading this book. The only bad part about finishing Volume One is not having a copy of Volume Two nearby. Buy both. You won't be sorry. <br />488 pages of text, 50 pages of notes and bibliography	2003-04-24

Match Wits with Encyclopedia Brown	Teaching kids to observe, think, and have fun at the same time?  Difficult?  Not with the Encyclopedia Brown books!  <br />This is actually the third book in the Encyclopedia Brown series by author Donald J. Sobol.  In this volume, Encyclopedia Brown, the smartest kid in Idaville, tackles ten cases.  Kids (and adults) will have a great time matching wits with Encyclopedia as they gather clues with him and seek to put together the pieces of the puzzle.  If you can't crack the puzzles, don't worry: the solutions to each case appear at the end of the book.  <br />These stories were first published in the 1960's, so they're a little dated, but they still provide loads of fun, and some of them are pretty tricky.  If you'd like to develop critical thinking and observation skills in your kids, you can't go wrong with Encyclopedia Brown.  <br />10 cases, 112 pages total	2003-04-21

That's not only the mark of great children's literature, it's the mark of great writing at any level.  <br />SOUNDER is the story of a poor African American family in the late 19th century south.  Sounder, the family's hunting dog, is responsible for much of the family income: he finds and tracks game that the father can eat and sell.  Problems arise when the local white sheriff and his men think the family has become a little too prosperous.  An event then happens which becomes a turning point in the oldest boy's life.  (The story is told with painful honesty from his point of view.)<br />Author Armstrong masterfully drops the reader into a different era, an era we would like to forget.  It's not a comfortable time and it's not a comfortable story, but it is a powerful one.  The story is a simple one, but Armstrong paints on a large canvas, full of description so vivid and true that we feel we're there, walking on the cold ground, smelling the countryside, and even feeling the wetness of the tears and blood.  <br />I believe it's significant that Sounder is the only character named in the book.  This is the boy's story, but it could be any boy.  He represents a sort of \\"every man,\\" or \\"every child,\\" if you will.  The boy learns several important lessons along the way, some of them coming from unlikely sources.  <br />SOUNDER is one of those stories that not only entertain children, but teach them valuable lessons in human nature, relationships, and learning.  A very, very important book for us all.  <br />116 pages with illustrations	2003-04-21

Well, what DOES it have going for it?  How about:<br />GREAT WRITING<br />Sturgeon was a thinker with a tremendous imagination.  I caught myself grinning often at several of his lines, at how he avoided clich&eacute;s and gave fresh ideas to simple scenes and concepts.  In the first section, \\"The Idiot,\\" I was reminded of the opening of Faulkner's `The Sound and the Fury.'  (Yes, comparing Sturgeon to Faulkner is NOT a stretch!)  The way Sturgeon gets inside Lone's head and lives there is amazing.  Wonderful writing that still reads with freshness 50 years later.<br />GREAT IDEAS<br />Six misfit outcasts, each with a unique gift, form a new step in man's evolution, a gestalt of unbelievable power.  I won't go into the social, political, and moral implications of such an idea (Read the book), but the concept by itself is interesting.  What Sturgeon does with it is fascinating.<br />GREAT STORYTELLING<br />I have not researched Sturgeon very much, but from what I have gathered, he was somewhat of a rogue who loved to examine the dark side of the human psyche.  This and his inability to be confined to a nice neat label come across in the writing to present a story that is exciting, awe-inspiring, and most important, honest.<br />If you've only read a few sf writers from the 50's (such as Asimov, Clarke, Bradbury, Bester, Simak, etc.), expand your horizons with Sturgeon.

Everyone.	`Hatchet' is one of those rare books that can be read and enjoyed by children and adults.  No matter who you are, you're likely to learn some important lessons about yourself.  <br />Thirteen year-old Brian is flying to visit his father in the Canadian wilderness.  Brian has little time to reflect upon his parents' recent divorce - the pilot suffers a heart attack during the flight and dies.  And no one else is aboard the plane.  If Brian doesn't find a way to land the plane, he'll die too.<br />To call `Hatchet' an \\"adventure story\\" would be a gross understatement.  It is so much more.  In Brian, readers of all ages will see a broad range of emotions: fear, courage, hope, despair.  Brian makes several discoveries, but the most important one is an inner discovery.  To survive in the wilderness, he must not only find a new way to live, but a new way to think.  <br />`Hatchet' is so well written, I never felt that anything Paulsen wrote was contrived or unbelievable.  Everything rings true, which is both rare and welcome.  `Hatchet,' like Lois Lowry's `Number the Stars,' is one of those books that everyone should read.  You might just find a new way to think...and to live.	2003-03-21

What a pleasure to see a children's book WITHOUT mass produced Disney characters, computer generated images, or a television show to promote.  `If All the Seas Were One Sea,' a Newbury Honor book first published in 1971, still looks great over 30 years later.  With simple, yet imaginative images, Janina Domanska creates a world of speculation and wonder in which to encase this nursery rhyme.  For a children's book, `If All the Seas' asks many philosophical questions.  Even if only for a few minutes, the book will force children to stop and think about its implications.

Finally the information and stories that fans have been waiting decades for come to life on the book's pages. And what stories they are...<br />I wish I could have been in Bristol when A.P., his wife Sara, and cousin Maybelle Carter made their first recording for Ralph Peer. It had to be one of those timeless moments in music history when someone realized that everything that had come before was about to change. Zwonitzer captures that moment and many others for the reader. The story of how the Carter Family was formed, thrived, soared, and then torn apart is a story that beats the heck out of any soap opera. It's a wonderful story, an inspiring story, and ultimately a heartbreaking story. The style of writing is familiar and comfortable, like an old uncle sitting on the front porch, telling you what it was like when the Carter Family was still around.<br />The best part of the book is the close examination of each of the three principal players in the Carter Family saga: The quiet, never-sitting-still A.P., leaving home for days on end, seeking out new songs for the group while further alienating his already distant wife Sara, the one person he could never forget. Maybelle, who loved performing almost as much as she loved her family. Her style of guitar playing is still studied and imitated by guitarists all over the world. And Sara - perhaps the most tragic figure of all...but I won't tell you the full story. (Otherwise you might not buy the book!)<br />'Will You Miss Me When I'm Gone' tells these stories so well that when it strays away from the three principal players, I grew less interested. It seemed much attention and far too many pages were devoted to too many minor characters. And so many other parts of the book were severely truncated: Where is all the information about Maybelle and Sara's reunion performances and recordings? How did they feelsinging songs they hadn't performed together in over 20 years? What about the origins of some of the songs? In one portion of the book, Zwonitzer tells us that Maybelle gave interviews telling where several of the songs came from, how A.P. put them together, etc., but I wanted to know more. After all, some of these songs have stood the test of time for over 75 years.<br />Although the book contains some disappointments, I can say the same for it that I do for the recordings: I'm thankful for what we have. It hurt me to read how the music of the Carter Family was almost forgotten by the music industry and the public in the 60's. This music is timeless. If you've never heard a Carter Family disc, buy one. Better yet, buy the 5-disc 1927-1934 set. (It's a steal on Amazon!) Then read the book. Sadly, we will probably never see their like again. But they were here for a short time, and what a difference they made and continue to make. The circle remains unbroken...but yes, we do miss them.<br />397 pages with photos	2003-03-13

Only the first two of Card's five chapters deal exclusively with SF&amp;F.  The other three apply to all genres.  Card spends the first chapter defining just what is SF, what is F and how to tell the difference.  SF&amp;F have many sub-genres (space opera, hard SF, cyperpunk, sword &amp; sorcery, etc.) and Card shows the reader that they all have several elements in common.  The second chapter focuses on creating believable worlds that readers will want to explore.  SF&amp;F is not an \\"anything goes\\" genre; you must have rules and follow them, especially with regard to time, space, and magic.  You also have to work out problems in your world's history, language, geography, and of course science.<br />Chapter 3, Story Construction, has already opened up new worlds for me (no pun intended).  Almost every story, no matter what your genre, falls into one of four categories: milieu (the time or place of the story is the most important element), idea, character, and event.  Knowing which your story is will help you write it better.  Very helpful examples are given.<br />Chapter 4, Writing Well, shows how to unfold your story.  True, this chapter is geared to the specifics of SF&amp;F, but contains extremely valuable information.  How much information should you share with the reader early on?  How much is too much?  Have you dropped enough clues or interesting pieces of information early on to keep the pages turning?  This chapter answers those questions and more.<br />Chapter 5, The Life and Business of Writing, is probably the most honest look at the writer's life that I've ever read.  Not only does Card offer advice on how to get your stories published, he also covers the pros and cons of conventions, classes, workshops, conferences, contests, handling your finances, and a subject that doesn't get addressed enough: balancing your writing life with your home life.<br />How to Write SF&amp;F is a book written by an author that cares about the genre and cares about writers.  He doesn't pull any punches, but you come away with the sense that Card wants (and expects) you to succeed as a writer.  I was extremely impressed with the way he uses examples from other writers' work and not his own.

But the man knows how to tell stories that people like to read.  He certainly didn't have to write this book, but he did.  I personally think novice writers could learn a thing or two from Mr. King...<br />ON WRITING is part autobiography, part writing guide.  In the autobiography section (which is mostly about writing), I really enjoyed learning how King started writing as the result of several childhood illnesses.  Early on, he wrote for his friends, his school paper, and his mom.  After his mom read one of his early stories, King says \\"She said it was good enough to be in a book.  Nothing anyone has said to me since has made me feel any happier.\\"  In and out of the principal's office for his writing in The Village Vomit, working and writing in a laundromat, the sale of his first story...it's all here and it's all entertaining.  (It's worth the price of the book just to read King's reaction to the sale of his first novel 'Carrie.') <br />\\"Toolbox\\" is a short section consisting of several of King's thoughts on grammar, punctuation, vocabulary, and the author's burning hatred of adverbs.  <br />\\"On Writing,\\" the third and final part of the book is devoted to the craft of writing.  Rather than summarize what's there, I thought I'd try to give you a taste of the book by including several of King's quotes on various writing issues:<br />The book-reading public:  \\"Book buyers aren't attracted, by and large, by the literary merits of a novel; (they) want a good story to take with them on the airplane.\\"<br />Plotting:  \\"I believe plotting and the spontaneity of real creation aren't compatible...There is a huge difference between story and plot.  Story is honorable and trustworthy; plot is shifty, and best kept under house arrest.\\"<br />Description:  \\"Description begins with visualization of what it is you want the reader to experience.  It ends with your translating what you see in your mind into words on the page.\\"<br />Dialogue:  \\"Dialogue is a skill best learned by people who enjoy talking and listening to others - particularly listening, picking up the accents, rhythms, dialect, and slang of various groups.\\"<br />Research:  \\"I simply made up all the stuff I didn't know.\\"  (!)<br />Classes/workshops:  \\"You learn best by reading a lot and writing a lot, and the most valuable lessons are the ones you teach yourself.\\"<br />Getting published:  \\"The most important thing you can do for yourself is read the market.\\"<br />\\"If I have to tell you, I lose.  If...I can show you...I win.\\"<br />I read this book three years ago for pleasure when I was not writing.  I enjoyed it, but it didn't really mean much to me at the time.  Since becoming a writer, the book is one I knew I had to own.  I admit it, I read a lot of King when I was younger and I still pick up one of his books or stories from time to time.  Do I think he's a great writer?  I don't think that's the question.  I think the question is, \\"What can Stephen King teach me about how to become a better writer?\\"  The answer, at least for me, is practical, no-nonsense information from a regular guy (a very rich regular guy, mind you) to another regular guy.  I'll take that any day.  <br />297 pages	2003-03-06

The teens may have been buying Elvis, Chuck Berry and Buddy Holly like crazy, but darn it, the Grammys would show the world what was REALLY good!<br />BROKEN RECORD chronicles the injustices heaped upon rock, soul, jazz, and other popular forms of music from the 1950 through the early 1990's.  Here are just a few of the Grammy's most embarrassing moments:<br />The entire Motown label received only ONE Grammy during the entire decade of the 60's.  One!<br />The Grammy for Best Performance by a Vocal Group in 1965 was won not by the Beatles, but by the Anita Kerr Group.  Remember them?  Didn't think so.  (The Anita Kerr Group won again the next year, beating out the Beach Boys' `Good Vibrations.'  Go figure.)<br />And who can forget what author Schipper calls \\"the ultimate Grammy fiasco,\\" Milli Vanilli?<br />On the bright side, the book also celebrates some of the Grammy's better calls: Tina Turner's triple win in 1984 and Bonnie Raitt's 1989 victories, just to name a couple.<br />The actually text of the book is very short: 100 pages of Grammy history followed by 50 brief pages spotlighting several artists' Grammy moments.  The entire second half of the book consists of a listing of all category winners (with the exception of the Lifetime Achievement Award).  <br />Schipper has a tendency to repeat himself during the book's first hundred pages.  I also noticed some inaccurate information, which I suppose can happen, but really should have been caught.  My biggest complaint is the amount of space given to the list of winners - Half the book!  Readers deserve a more comprehensive history of the Grammy Awards than a mere 100 pages which mostly cover pop.  Very little attention is given to jazz, country, soul, classical, or other categories.  <br />271 pages	2003-02-19

As a reader of mysteries and thrillers, I really get tired of writers who jerk you around from one red-herring to another in order to steer your attention away from a plot detail you might have otherwise noticed.

(Scorsese is interviewed by both Ebert and Siskel.  Spielberg is interviewed by Siskel; Lucas by Ebert.)<br /> Much of the focus of this little book is directed toward film preservation, although the title of the book also refers to trends in filmmaking.  It is interesting to see the predictions that all three directors made for the future of film when these interviews were conducted in 1990.  Along the way, we gain a bit of insight into the passion these three directors (and these two critics) have for films and their future.  An interesting look for the casual fan or the serious film lover.<br />116 pages	2003-02-05

Yes, her worries are few...until she finds herself on a rocket ship to Mars.<br />This children's book, first published in 1951, does indeed show its age, but it also retains its charm. Miss Pickerell's light adventure is a delightful way to introduce children to some very basic scientific concepts: gravity, space travel, magnetism, and more. Sure, the science is quite dated, but Miss Pickerell is a treasure.<br />Still waiting for the next Harry Potter book to come out?

Got a bad attitude that you can't get rid of?  Do you find yourself complaining a lot?  Maybe you think it's your circumstances or the people around you that are responsible.  James Allen doesn't believe it for a minute.  It's all in your head.  Literally.<br />Allen writes, \\"Out of a clean heart comes a clean life and a clean body.  Out of a defiled mind proceeds a defiled life and a corrupt body.\\"  We ARE what we think.  It's not mind-over-matter.  The mind IS matter.  You can improve your circumstances, your surroundings, your station in life...but until you conquer your thoughts, nothing will really change.  When your mind is pure, your body, your language, your actions...all will follow.<br />Whether you choose to believe Allen or dismiss him, AS A MAN THINKETH will occupy your mind far beyond the time it takes you to read its 72 pages.

Rex Stout's 9th Nero Wolfe outing is the first to contain more than one story.  The novellas \\"Black Orchids\\" and \\"Cordially Invited to Death\\" reveal Stout at his best.  <br />In \\"Black Orchids,\\" Wolfe endures the perils involved in leaving the brownstone to attend a flower show.  Ah, yet this is no ordinary flower show, but one in which the world's only black orchids are on display.  Wolfe has as much fun as his enormous envy will allow until someone is murdered at the show.  <br />The second story, \\"Cordially Invited to Death\\" is a fun romp for both Wolfe and Archie, but not for the murderer of a woman who organizes lavish parties.  And Wolfe even (gasp!) allows a woman in the kitchen!  <br />Stout's first eight Wolfe stories all contain good cases, interesting characters, and tough knots for Wolfe's sharp mind to untangle, but with BLACK ORCHIDS Wolfe and Archie finally find themselves.  Their characteristics, mannerisms, and attitudes have been refined and honed to perfection.  Stout was on it.  <br />As other reviewers have noted, \\"Cordially Invited to Death\\" contains a mystery within a mystery.  I wouldn't dream of spoiling it for you, so jump in and enjoy a couple of wonderful Nero Wolfe adventures.  You won't be sorry.	2003-01-22

Since I hadn't read a young adult book in nearly 30 years, I decided to read a few to learn what to recommend to customers.  The first one I picked up was `Number the Stars.'  It blew me away.<br />Lowry has written an incredibly moving account of the Jews in World War II Denmark.  Annemarie Johansen worries what might happen to her Jewish friend Ellen Rosen as the Nazis capture and \\"relocate\\" all Jews.  During this time, Annemarie learns about the power of evil, the strength of family, and the unbreakable bonds of friendship.  Lowry does a masterful job of showing how Annemarie grows up before our very eyes in the way she interacts with her little sister Kirsti, her friend Ellen, and the ever present Nazi officers.  Annemarie learns several lessons throughout the book that she'll never forget.  We won't forget them either.  <br />This is an incredibly moving book.

Paul Wilson, pick this one up, strap yourself in, and don't look down. You're in for a treat.<br />Repairman Jack is an immediately likable character. He's a mysterious guy who's part detective, part Indiana Jones, part street-wise tough guy. When he's contacted by a man who wants to locate his missing wife, Jack smells trouble. It's bad enough she's missing, but she also hangs out with a \\"conspiracy theory\\" crowd, some of them VERY wacky. Jack reluctantly decides to take the case. Almost immediately, he regrets it. I won't tell you why; that's half the fun.<br />Wilson does a great job of giving the reader colorful characters, breathtaking situations, snappy dialogue, and just enough weirdness. Wilson really knows how to tell a story and keep it moving in an entertaining and intelligent way. <br />CONSPIRACIES is the third Repairman Jack novel. It's not necessary to have read the first two (I haven't), but it might help. It would certainly help to have read something by Wilson. (His most popular novel, THE KEEP, is a great book that will give you a good sense of Wilson's style.) When you're reading, however, do remember that this is a series and that more books are on the way.

You should too.    <br />PI Tess Monaghan turns down a would-be client who wants her to unmask the \\"Poe Toaster,\\" a mysterious person who visits Edgar Allan Poe's gravesite each year with three roses and half a bottle of cognac.  Although she refuses to take the case, Tess can't help being curious.  On the anniversary of Poe's death, Tess expects to stand at a distance and see a strange caped individual visit the cold Baltimore grave site.  But she sees two caped figures.  One dies from a bullet, the other escapes.  Then things get really creepy when Tess receives cryptic notes at her door...along with three roses and a half bottle of cognac. <br />`In a Strange City' is a pleasure to read because it works on so many levels.  Lippman writes a very smart tale with wonderful descriptions of Baltimore and its people, but that's only part of what makes the book work.  She not only knows how to write great characters, she also pens believable dialogue.  Her examination of Poe devotees and collectors is nothing short of fascinating.  Many excellent mystery writers are capable of presenting readers with an entertaining, intriguing story, but Lippman takes it a step further.  When I closed the book, I knew I had finished a great story, but I also knew that I was going to be forced to examine the possessions I cherish and ask myself how far I would go to protect them? <br />A very satisfying read - 310 pages	2003-01-01

It helps to be familiar with at least one or two of them before jumping into this book; she refers to her work quite a bit...maybe a little too much.  Yet, Highsmith's comments are mostly helpful in such areas as plotting, point of view, and revisions.  <br />From the very beginning, Highsmith advises writers to write in order to please one person: yourself.  If you read good works and are satisfied with your own work, you're probably producing good writing.  She also recommends focusing on characters and allowing them to take on a life of their own.<br />There are times when Highsmith seems to throw out all kinds of advice, sometimes contradicting what she has said earlier.  For example, she strongly advises outling each chapter and its events, yet she also advocates winging it free-write style, without knowing where you're going.<br />Overall, a helpful book, but more valuable information should be packed into its 145 pages.	2002-12-30

Many will write books on how to sell what you've written or how to write novels that will fly off the shelves, but few provide any real, practical information on how to hone the craft of writing.  Let such things not be said about Ursula K. Le Guin.<br />Le Guin says that while the &quot;gift&quot; can't be earned, the craft of writing can.  All artists practice and work at their craft: musicians, painters, sculptors, dancers....even writers.  The craft can be developed and Le Guin shows us how.  <br />You won't find any pie-in-the-sky philosophies about writing in this book, just practical information which, if followed, will make you a better writer.  Le Guin's chapters include:<br />The Sound of Your Writing<BR>Sentence Length and Complex Syntax<BR>Repetition<BR>Adjective and Adverb<BR>Point of View and Voice<BR>Changing Point of View<BR>and much more.<br />Each chapter contains writing exercises specific to the chapter topic.  (Le Guin also suggests many titles for further reading.)  This book will become a gold mine to any writer of fiction or creative non-fiction.  It's the perfect book to use for a writers' group or peer group.  Thank you, Ms. Le Guin, for sharing your gift with us.	2002-12-05

Out of nowhere, a white woman wanders into a Chinese railway workers' camp.  The time is Winter, 1873.  The place is the Washington Territory.  The woman says nothing.  (Nothing discernable, anyway.)  No one can explain who the woman is, where she is from, or how she got there.  This is the situation Karen Joy Fowler presents to the reader in this astounding, wonderful book.  <br />`Sarah Canary' meets many different people on her strange journey and she affects the lives of everyone she meets.  Four people in particular fall under her strange spell:  Chin - a Chinese railway worker who seeks to take her back where she belongs; B.J. - an escaped mental patient; Harold - a huckster who wants to put Sarah in his traveling freak show; and Adelaide Dixon, a woman suffragist.  <br />`Sarah Canary' is all about perceptions.  Each of these four characters see Sarah as something slightly different.  Their perceptions also cause their lives to each change in different and fascinating ways. <br />When I finished `Sarah Canary,' I realized that Fowler had taught me a lot about the times I live in now.  Perceptions are the focus of the book, but Fowler also touches on the cultural differences of different types of people, prejudices, superstitions, and much more.  After reading the book, I realized that I had come away with a better (but maybe not a more positive) picture of human nature.<br />From what I know about the history of the book, Fowler had a difficult time finding a publisher, not due to the book's quality, but rather the book's genre.  It has none.  It has been labeled historical fiction, Western, science fiction, comedy, mystery.  It is all of these and none of these.  `Sarah Canary' is impossible to pigeonhole.  Maybe that's why I lot of people I talk to haven't read it.  They're missing a gold mine.  I hope you don't miss out.  Read it and see why Fowler is one of the most gifted talents writing today.  <br />381 pages	2002-11-26

For anyone new to the Christian faith, or for anyone seeking answers to what Christians believe, this book will be a welcome read.  <br />Sproul tackles all of the major tenets of Christianity from &quot;Who is God&quot; to &quot;What is Heaven like?&quot;  What does baptism mean?  What is sanctification?  Should I obey the government?  <br />The book contains 102 chapters, none of which runs more than three or four pages.  The bite-sized chunks are perfect for personal daily reading or for group study.  Each chapter also contains Scriptural references dealing with the topic covered.  <br />'Essential Truths' will not answer all your questions, but it is a good place to start for the new Christian, the skeptic, or anyone in between.  My only complaint:  Sproul gives a list of books for further reading at the back of the book, but doesn't break them down by category.  All in all, however, Sproul has given readers a great introduction to the basics of the Christian faith.	2002-11-26

I was correct on both counts.  <br />`Sister Noon' is set in late Nineteenth-century San Francisco.  The Civil War has been over for several years, the local population has grown, and the city is just discovering its identity.  Whether they know it or not, people are becoming prepared for the new century, hanging on loosely to old ideas and ideals and sometimes resisting new ones.  <br />Lizzie works at a shelter for mostly orphaned children.  Lizzie is the classic spinster:  only in her early 30's, she is already an old maid in the social circles of San Francisco, with no hopes for permanent male companionship.<br />A different type of companion arrives in the form of a little girl named Jenny.  Jenny is brought to the shelter by a Mrs. Pleasant, a strange, beautiful woman who is rumored to be a witch, a voodoo priestess, or something even more bizarre.  The introduction of Jenny and Mrs. Pleasant causes Lizzie to examine her own life in ways she had never before imagined, and call into question beliefs that were formerly firmly planted in her being.  <br />Fowler is a master of the economy of words.  She gives us just enough description of the characters and their surroundings without over-doing it.  She expertly introduces marvelous characters and situations that draw us deeper and deeper into the story until the final page.  Fowler creates a world from the distant past that is both familiar and strange.  Perhaps her sparse description makes us hunger for more.  Perhaps it's the eerie mood she creates out of everyday events and objects.  However you label it, Fowler's writing is magic and addictive.  Don't be surprised if you find yourself under Fowler's spell, buying all of her books.  And what a great spell to be under.  Enjoy.<br />336 pages	2002-10-25

She's an award-winning science fiction writer who is universally recognized as one of the best in the genre.  With `Oaths and Miracles' and now with `Stinger,' she has proven that she can stand  toe-to-toe with the best of the thriller/suspense writers as well.<br />`Stinger' begins with Senator Malcolm Peter Reading, a presidential hopeful, collapsing during a speech.  Reading, an African-American, dies in a matter of minutes.  It is discovered that he had contracted malaria.  Others quickly begin dying of malaria.  Nearly all of them are African-American.  Then the epidemic begins.<br />FBI agent Robert Cavanaugh and Dr. Melanie Anderson of the Centers for Disease Control quickly discover that the deaths are not accidents.  Someone...or some country...has reintroduced malaria into America.  The cards appear to be stacked against them: they have few clues and little time.  To complicate matters, both Cavanaugh and Anderson are faced with personal and professional crises just as an answer is beginning to develop.  <br />I have always appreciated two things about the writing of Nancy Kress:  fascinating characters and scientific ideas a clod like me can understand.  Cavanaugh acts exactly the way we think an FBI agent should - logical, methodical thinking, going through the proper steps at the proper time, etc, but Kress shows us that while the agent has everything together on the job, that doesn't necessarily mean every aspect of his life is in order.  Melanie Anderson is an African-American woman who is mad as hell at what is happening.  She's not perfect, yet we identify with her, hurt for her, and cheer for her.  Two great characters.<br />`Stinger' is a great thrill-ride all the way to the very last page, but it is also chilling in another aspect.  Although this book was published in 1998, it has some frightening parallels to the events surrounding Sept. 11.  A real page-turner...and a real eye opener.<br />303 fast-moving pages	2002-09-30

Lee takes the reader on a guided tour of how he came to be a writer of many of the comics that millions of readers still can't live without.  Lee describes how many of his greatest creations became not only great comic book titles, but also animated cartoons, live action television shows, motion pictures, and more.<br />As you might imagine with any autobiography (Lee calls it a \\"bio-autography\\"), the author spends a lot of time talking about how he got involved in his line of work, how he met his wife, friends, etc.  I wanted to read more about the creative process and how Lee interacted with his artists.  (He does spend time talking mostly about Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko.)  Lee pinpoints a couple of important events in Marvel's history, most notably the three Spider-Man issues from the late 60's dealing with the drug problem, issues that did not carry the Comics Code Authority seal of approval.  The book needed many more such interesting stories.  While Lee's friends and social contacts are important to him, few of them had anything to do with the comic book world, and I thought he spent a little too much time focusing on them.  <br />`Excelsior!' works best when Lee describes the struggles and victories, the highs and lows, and especially his own perseverance in the comic book world and the publishing industry.  It works the least when he spends too much time on people not directly connected to the world of Marvel Comics.  <br />246 pages	2002-09-09

Once on Earth, the criminal can inhabit any living body and hide there, becoming a \\"needle in a haystack.\\"  But The Hunter can use the same methods also...He inhabits the body of a young boy who aids The Hunter in his search for the criminal.<br />`Needle' was written in 1949, probably for an adult audience, but it reads today as almost a Young Adult novel.  Maybe that's because most of the book is told from the boy Bob's point of view.  The language and atmosphere Clement uses certainly seem very dated by today's standards.  The book's best scenes involve the relationship that develops between Bob and The Hunter.  When it gets away from that, this `Needle' becomes rather dull.  Fortunately that doesn't happen too often.  Although today's readers are very familiar with stories of aliens inhabiting human bodies, `Needle' was probably a first for its time.  That familiarity diminishes the impact of the book in 2002, but it's still a pretty good read.      <br />207 pages	2002-09-06

It's a real pleasure (and a rare one) to see an individual that gets carried away in his work.  You know after reading just a few pages of 'The Great Movies' that Roger Ebert is such a person.  <br />Ebert examines what he believes to be not the BEST 100 films of all time, but simply 100 great films.  There are certainly more than 100, and I hope Ebert will write about many, many more of them. <br />Read the book with an open mind.  After reading Ebert's essays, I was persuaded to at least consider viewing some of the films that I never would have considered before.  <br />I imagine that it was somewhat difficult for Ebert to limit himself to a 3-4 page essay per film.  You can tell that he could have gone on and on with his comments and still not even scratched the surface of evidence explaining why the film is great.  His expertise and enthusiam are obvious and compelling.    <br />Of course, people will argue over why Ebert chose this film and not that one, but isn't that half the fun of such a book?  I guarantee that if you set this book between any two film lovers and hang around long enough, you're going to experience some great film conversation.  I suspect that's one of the reasons Ebert wrote the book - to get people talking/discussing/arguing about great movies.  Thanks, Roger, and bring on the next 100.<br />511 pages	2002-09-03

The book opens with the \\"other\\" universal language:  a kiss.  But I won't give the details away.  The Vice-President of an unnamed South American country is throwing a  birthday party for a wealthy Japanese businessman.  Why?  The Vice-President is hoping that businessman Hosokawa will build one of his businesses in this poor South American country.  But Hosokawa has no such interests.  He attends the party only because his favorite soprano, the world-renowned Roxanne Coss, will be present to sing. <br />The recital/party is literally shattered by the invasion of a group of terrorists who take the entire house hostage until their demands are met.  Hosokawa's secretary/translator, a young man named Gen, steps forward to help negotiate with the terrorists.  Between the terrorists and the guests, several languages are present:  English, Spanish, Japanese, Russian, German, and more.  Since Gen can speak them all, he becomes the official spokesman for just about everyone.  'Bel Canto' is all about two things:  Communicating and the power of music.  Patchett takes a wide assortment of characters and shows us how much they really do have in common as they are linked by soprano Coss and translator Gen.  But the book is about much more...<br />Patchett's imagery is so stunning and so fresh, you almost feel like you are right there in the middle of the action, hearing several languages and, of course, the music.  'Bel Canto' superbly explores the things that we hold precious in our lives:  love, friendship, loyalty, honor, courage, committment, and duty.  Ann Patchett has given us music that literally reflects our own lives.   <br />Some readers have said that the progression of events in 'Bel Canto' is too unrealistic and far-fetched.  I don't think so.  Everything happens in 'Bel Canto' for a purpose and if you allow its events to soak in, I think you'll find anincredible story and maybe a lesson or two on what it is to be human.  Highly recommended.  <br />318 pages	2002-08-30
US	49336548	R3SG2MK0OAVCR	0553562738	466136665	Doomsday Book	Books	5	13	17	N	N	Why Did It Win the Hugo and the Nebula?  Here's Why:	Anyone who picks up 'Doomsday Book' expecting to find aliens from another galaxy, spaceships, intergalactic conflict, hard science, or Jack the Ripper is going to be severely disappointed.  Maybe that's why I'm reading so many negative reviews here.  I think a lot of reviewers have both missed the boat and a great read.  <br />As 'Doomsday Book' opens, a young university history student named Kivrin is preparing to travel back in time to the year 1320 for an on-site study of English people and their customs before the Black Plague hit.  Mr. Dunworthy, Kivrin's professor, fears she is not prepared, even though Kivrin has spent months learning about the era, its customs, its language, and its dangers.  He feels that something is wrong, dangerously wrong.  <br />He's right.  Something has gone wrong.  Kivrin lands in the Fourteenth Century, but not in 1320.  She finds out (in more ways than one) that the time she is in can be very, very dangerous.  In the meantime, an epidemic has broken out in Dunworthy's time (the year is 2054), taking the professor's energy away from trying to rescue Kivrin.<br />I think the mistake some readers make when reading 'Doomsday Book' is in expecting a thrill-a-minute ride that never stops until the last page.  If that was what she wanted, it wouldn't have taken Connie Willis five years to research and write the book.  I think people are not judging the book she has written.  That's too bad because the book Willis has given us is a jewel.  Why?  First, its expertly written.  Yes, the research is evident and impressive, but Willis makes you feel that everything you are reading about is absolutely authentic, all the way down to the fabric of the clothes people wore in Fourteenth Century England.  Second, the characters are not stereo-typed.  It would have been soooooo easy to have Kivrin stumble into the Fourteenth Century and instantly be considered a witch or a demon.  It also would have been easy to portray the &quot;contemps&quot; as backwards, ignorant people clinging to superstition as their religion.  Willis is much too smart for that.  Instead, she gives us a very believable heroine in Kivrin, a young woman who is as prepared as one could be for such a journey until she arrives and discovers that no amount of preparation would have been enough.  The people she meets are not one-dimensional cardboard characters who are incapable of thinking.  They are richly drawn complex people who I will remember for a long time.  Finally, the parallels between the two time periods provides an interesting study.  Have things really changed in seven hundred years?  Are people really so much different now than they were then?  The answers might surprise you.  <br />Only one part of the book began to grow tedious for me:  The constant presence of Dunworthy's assistant Finch, a yes-man if I ever saw one.  Other than this, 'Doomsday Book' is a book to enjoy and treasure.  <br />578 pages	2002-08-20

'The Sparrow' is much more than that, as readers will see after reading just a few pages. After that, you'll be hooked.<BR> <BR>'The Sparrow' begins with the release of a Jesuit priest, Father Emilio Sandoz, from a hospital. Sandoz has just returned to Earth as the lone survivor of an eight person expedition to Rakhat, a distant planet. The Catholic Church wants to know many things from Sandoz: What was first contact with an alien race like? What/who do they worship? What happened to the other seven members of the expedition and why are you the only survivor? <br />Russell tells this fascinating tale through the interrogation(s) of Sandoz by the ruling Catholic authorities and through flashbacks. At first, Sandoz refuses to talk about the trip at all. We can see that something happened that's extremely painful for him to share. But gradually, we come to see the wonder, the glory, and the horror that Sandoz saw. And it is incredible. <br />'The Sparrow' is a science fiction work, but not hard sf. If you're the type of reader who gets turned off by all the techincal jargon of many science fiction stories, don't worry. You'll find none of that here. What you will find, for one thing, are absolutely wonderfully written characters. Of all the eight people on the mission, readers will find someone with whom they can identify with. You may even find someone like yourself. <br />Readers will also find a lot of questions posed that most novels are afraid to touch, specifically about the nature of God and how He works in the lives of people. Russell is not afraid to throw the tough questions out there for your consideration. That in itself is refreshing. <br />The book is also, quite simply, a great read. What DID happen to Sandoz? Why was he the only survivor? 'The Sparrow' keeps you guessing until the very end, and when the end comes, you'll be asking yourself a lot of questions...big questions, and not just about the book. I would not dream of giving anything away about the story, but be warned: Some parts of the book are quite disturbing. Not for kids. <br />The book also includes an interview with the author (Don't read it until you've finished the entire book.) as well as questions for discussion. <br />405 pages	2002-08-12

Just before she dies, she whispers \\"He's alive.\\"  Will knows that she is referring to his brother Ken.  Ken has been missing for eleven years (and presumed dead) after being the prime suspect in a murder case.  It just so happens that the girl murdered was Will's first love.  <br />For most authors, such a premise would be more than enough to begin an engaging mystery thriller, but not Coben.  There's more.  Just after the death of his mother, Will's current girlfriend disappears without a trace.  And \\"The Ghost,\\" a strange character from Will's past arrives on the scene with the worst of intentions.  <br />Coben does a wonderful job of showing the reader the lengths that Will is willing to go to in order to find out the truth about his brother, the truth about his girlfriend, and perhaps the truth about himself.  Coben's characters, both major and minor, are right on target.  While some of these characters may be foreign to us, they are completely believable.  The settings are all handled with just the right amount of information and atmosphere.  All of these elements make an excellent read, but the real strength in Coben's writing is his pacing and anticipation.  The novel never bogs down, never becomes less than incredibly interesting, and always keeps the pages turning.  Coben knows exactly how to handle this roller coaster ride.  <br />I hesitate to give the book five stars.  It probably deserves four and a half.  I thought the ending was a little too unlikely as far as some of the characters are concerned.  I'm not sure the actions of one or two of them would have really worked out the way Coben chose them to.  I may be wrong, but even if I'm right, I think you'll enjoy 'Gone For Good' as a very engaging read.  Hang on and enjoy the ride.	2002-08-08

But Berberian does much more than tell a simple story.  While in the hospital, the main character/narrator goes through a mental journey of his life and what is important to him.  I think readers will be surprised at what they'll find.  This man has a love of cycling, a love for fine food, love for a woman...and all of these loves blend together to make him more than just a faceless terrorist.  Don't get me wrong, the book is NOT endorsing terrorism in any way, but rather giving us a glimpse of what might go through the mind of a terrorist as the designated act of destruction draws near.  A very short book (187 pages) that can be read in just a couple of hours, 'The Cyclist' deserves to be read and discussed.	2002-08-05

A lot of readers will disagree with this statement, and they have the right to do so.  Good science fiction can be enjoyed by many readers through various interpretations.  Good science fiction tells us about ourselves and the world we live in.  GREAT science fiction does this and more.  After reading just a few pages of 'The Left Hand of Darkness,' I knew I was reading great science fiction...and maybe a little bit more.<br />Ursula K. Le Guin's novel is the story of Genly Ai, a Terran representative who has been sent to Gethen, a planet where the harshness of winter is nearly constant.  The coldness of the planet provides many challenges for Ai, but even more challenging is being the lone human in the midst of a sexless population.  The inhabitants of the planet are neither male or female until the time of mating.  Even during that time, the participants themselves have no way of knowing whether they will become male or female.  After the mating period, they revert to being neutral.  <br />Ai is completely a stranger in a world he can't understand.  He's not sure who to trust.  The planet's inhabitants certainly aren't sure if they can trust a being who is always the same gender.  Even when friendships begin to develop, Ai is not sure who he can trust.  Things are never as they appear, which makes his mission more and more dangerous.<br />'The Left Hand of Darkness' was groundbreaking when it was first published in 1969.  The roles of men and women were being questioned just about everywhere in this country and Le Guin addressed those issues brilliantly.  This was an incredibly important for its time.  Many readers have stated that the novel lacks impact today because of the progress that has been made in dealing with gender issues.  Perhaps, but the issues that Le Guin targets are in some ways still with us.  This is not a book to refer to and say, \\"Yeah, this bookcame out when we were searching for our male and female identities.\\"  The book is much more than just an allegorical look at gender issues in the 1960's.  Le Guin's writing style keeps it from being remembered for that reason only.  <br />I once heard a major science fiction writer say that Ursula Le Guin walks on water.  Her writing certainly does.  Le Guin masterfully creates a word in which everyone is comfortable with the status quo except for Ai...and the reader.  In the reader's mind, Gethen becomes a real place.  I read the book in July and felt like I was constantly trying to warm myself on the icy planet.  Not only is her setting well done, the characters tell us all we need to know, just enough so that the ending really means something to the reader.  It's far more than simply the feeling of a satisfying ending.  It's the feeling that you've read something that was important when published and continues to be important.	2002-08-02

If you read a lot of books, you probably spend a lot of time searching for one of those rare one-of-a-kind reading experiences that not only entertains, but teaches and moves you.  If that's the type of book you long for, 'The Lovely Bones' is the book for you.<br />Author Alice Sebold has taken a bold and unusual step:  The narrator of her story is a dead girl named Susie, who narrates the book from heaven.  Susie died after being abducted and violated by a neighbor, Mr. Harvey.  She has the unique vantage point of being able to look down from heaven and see how her death has affected her family, her friends, and her murderer.  <br />Her surviving parents, sister and brother are the primary focus of the book:  How they related to Susie, how they are trying to deal with her death, and how they are attempting to get on with their lives without her.  But it's much, much more.  Sebold has wonderful insights on relationships and writes in such a compelling way that you not only hurt for those left behind to deal with the tragedy, but also examine your own feelings about life, death, and the people you love.  This is a tremendous and beautifully written book.  The book has received many honors and deserves every one of them.  Read it and you'll know why too.	2002-07-27

Child's fans know that anytime they pick up a new Reacher novel, they can expect:<br />1 - Great action<BR>2 - A tightly wound plot<BR>3 - A feeling of suspense, knowing that Reacher is going to kick someone's butt at least a couple of times in the book...it's just a matter of when and how hard.<br />'Echo Burning' finds Reacher hitchhiking in West Texas.  He's picked up by a woman who definitely needs help.  Her abusive husband (whom she helped send to prison) is coming home soon, and not to treat her with tender loving care.  The husband's family (who hates the woman because she is Mexican) is also anxious for his return and is, of course, on his side.  But is the woman telling Reacher the truth?  Is there more to the story than what she's telling?  <br />'Echo Burning' is not a great story, but it's good.  Child's description of the West Texas heat and atmosphere get a little old and repetitive, but you can overlook that.  As mysteries go, 'Echo Burning' is not a bad way to spend an afternoon.	2002-07-27

As you journey from Oklahoma to California with the Joad Family, you'll experience the same obstacles and emotions they experienced:  hunger, pain, separation of family, deplorable living and working conditions, tears, laughter, life, death.  But this book is so much more.  Whether or not you agree with his political views, no one can deny that Steinbeck was a brilliant writer.  That brilliance is evident in every page of this novel.

Matt finds that through reciting poetry and literature, he can cast \\"spells\\" which help him and his new-found friends through some really tough spots as they seek to reclaim their kingdom from a wicked tyrant and his magic.<br />Two aspects of 'Her Majesty's Wizard' kept me hooked:<br />1 - The action is practically non-stop.  You will have to turn many, many pages from the very beginning to find a place to breathe!  Stasheff has given action/adventure fans their money's worth.  <br />2 - The deeper implications of moral and theological thought.  Stasheff's writing goes way beyond a casual look at \\"good vs. evil.\\"  He is able to examine, without getting too preachy, what drives his characters to do what they do.  Stasheff gives us some very good scenes in which characters have to make some serious and possibly costly decisions that affect not only themselves, but many others.  I appreciated the deeper look into the moral and theological issues, although it seems from other reviews that other readers don't.  I found it refreshing. <br />If you enjoy fantasy or just like a good adventure, I highly recommend 'Her Majesty's Wizard.'	2002-07-11

Whether or not you happen to like Ray Bradbury's work, you can't dispute his passion for writing, which is evident from page one.  <br />Bradbury (who turns 82 this year) is a writer of enormous output.  In this series of essays, the author lets us in on many of his secrets, but the bottom line is this:  If you love what you do, and are excited about it, nothing can stop you.  Much of Bradbury's writing is connected with his childhood experiences and memories, which allows him to jump into writing like a kid jumping into a swimming pool on a hot summer day.  Bradbury recounts many of his writing experiences and influences in the book and they are all fascinating.  I can't imagine any writer (or lover of stories) who would not enjoy this book.

The book was published in 1988.  Reading it was like hearing a voice crying in the wilderness.  I can hear Hirsch's voice speaking louder with each passing year.<br />This vital information that Hirsch refers to is simply not being taught in schools, at least not enough of them.  If you're concerned, ask your child what he's learning in history, science, math, English.  Or just flip through the appendix in the back of the book where Hirsch lists his &quot;What Literate Americans Know.&quot;  Sure, it's not a perfect list, but it is a starting point.  <br />Our culture is rapidly becoming one in which movie stars, professional sports stars, and scandals in the news are the factors that tie us together culturally as a nation.

If you like great characters and great writing, they may be yours also.<br />Kress has the amazing ability to communicate complex scientific ideas (like genetic engineering, microbiology, and cloning) and make them very understandable.  Combine this skill with the ability to create characters that the reader really cares about, and you've got a collection of entertaining and thought-provoking stories.	2002-05-07

In his will, he leaves his sisters (named April, May, and June) a peach, a pear, and an apple, respectively.  But, to a young woman who was _not_ his wife, he leaves a huge chunk of his fortune.  The sisters come to Wolfe to find out what's behind this wacky will.  But Wolfe suspects that maybe the hunting accident was no accident...<br />I am stunned to read that other reviewers consider this book to be one of Stout's worst.  I completely disagree.  How can this be a bad Wolfe entry when:<br />Wolfe is faced with _three_ women in his house at once<BR>Wolfe faces the threat of arrest from Cramer <BR>Fred Durkin has his best scenes in the series so far<BR>Archie has one of his best outings<BR>(And finally,) Wolfe leaves the house!<br />Sure, this is not the _best_ Wolfe story Stout ever wrote.  It does have some character inconsistencies that later stories don't have.  There are also some real problems with the plot.  And, true, this would not be the book to start with for first-time Wolfe readers.  But should it be included in the trash pile?  Definitely not.  An average Nero Wolfe story, after all, is better than most writers' \\"above average\\" output.  Dig in.	2002-05-03

Read on to find out why.<br />William Shirer has done the world a great service in creating this monumental work.  Anyone who may continue to wonder at the presence of evil in the world would do well to read Shirer's book.  The author expertly describes how evil manifested itself to produce one of history's greatest villians, Adolph Hitler.  Shirer traces how Hitler became the Hitler we know today and how his twisted ideas led converts, demanded allegiance, and terrorized millions.  Nearly the entire work is taken from journals, diaries, and eye-witness accounts of those who experienced the years leading to Nazi Germany and beyond.  (Shirer himself was an eye-witness to many of the events recorded in the work.)  This is a completely readable, comprehensive look at one of history's darkest hours.<br />The first thing readers will encounter is the immense size of the book, nearly 1200 pages of text.  Please do not be intimidated by the number of pages.  They are well worth your time.  Not a word is wasted.  Take it in small bites.<br />As I read the book, I kept thinking over and over of the parallels with our current situation against terrorism, and I wondered, \\"Have we really learned anything?\\"  In the late 1930's, anyone who had read Hitler's \\"Mein Kampf\\" would have known exactly what the dictator planned to do to the world.  He spelled it out.  Either no one read it (which is doubtful), or no one took him seriously.  Bin Laden also told this country what his plans were before Sept. 11.  Clearly.  We didn't listen then either.  Of course, that's not the only parallel.  There are more, and as each presents itself, the more relevant this book becomes to us today.  Reading the book, you will learn that Hitler did a multitude of things expertly, but was not thorough in many of his plans.  The terrorists are extremely thorough.  Hitler many times did not look far enough ahead (especially with respect to Russia).  The terrorists obviously plan months and years in advance.  Many of Hitler's henchmen were incompetent in many areas, military and economic.  It doesn't appear that incompetence is a major terrorist problem.  They know what they're doing.  When the time came, the United States was prepared for the Nazis of the Third Reich.  May we be even more prepared for the evils that we face today.  Don't fall into the trap of thinking 'The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich' is a crusty old history book that belongs on a shelf in a library.  Read it now and look around you.  I think you'll see that Shirer's work is frighteningly relevant.ugh ahead (especially with respect to Russia).  The terrorists obviously plan months and years in advance.

'Over My Dead Body' finds a young lady who arrives at Wolfe's door claiming to be Wolfe's daughter.  Wow!  What a way to start the book!  Things begin to heat up even more when the young lady is suspected of a murder in a fencing studio.  <br />This is the seventh entry in the Wolfe series, and it is an entertaining one.  Wolfe is in his usual beer-drinking, orchid-loving form, using that brilliant mind of his to sort out any difficulty.  In this book, we begin to see a little more depth in two of the recurring minor characters in Wolfe's employ:  First, Fred Durkin, the lumbering, bumbling guy who is not too bright, but is always there when Wolfe needs him.  Second, Saul Panzer, who is probably just as good a detective as Archie (well, almost), but is completely no-nonsense.  (And Archie thinks he's better looking than Saul.)<br />I'd give the book 4.5 stars if I could.  The only problem is Wolfe says a few words and lines that really aren't in character for him.  This would only distract readers who have read a lot of the books.  Since this book is still fairly early in the series, Stout can be forgiven.  'Over My Dead Body' is definitely a Wolfe book not to be missed.	2002-04-10

Here's a Good One to Start With	For anyone who has ever thought, &quot;I really should read the classics,&quot; 'Pride and Prejudice' is a wonderful place to begin.  Why?  First, the work is very readable, even though it was written well over a hundred years ago.  Second, it's not too long and the chapters are very short.  (I hope I'm beginning to convince you...)  Third, maybe you'll see yourself in the book or someone you know.  Fourth, Austen takes a humorous, entertaining, and throught-provoking look at human nature, which has not changed and probably never will.<br />Austen's heroine, Elizabeth Bennett, is a bright, intelligent young lady who is delighted to see her older sister Jane meet and fall for an English gentleman.  At the same time that her sister meets someone, Elizabeth meets a brash, arrogant man named Darcy.  Darcy's manner quickly irritates and disgusts Elizabeth beyond belief.  There's no way this couple could ever get together, right?  :)<br />Austen does a masterful job of telling an intelligent story that works as social commentary, a study of human nature, class distinctions, and so much more.  So many subtle shades of human pride, prejudice, arrogance, condescension, and forgiveness are present in the book as they are in real life.	2002-03-30

Baer Tells Us	'See No Evil' documents Robert Baer's career as a CIA field officer, but it also does much more.  It shows us how intelligence in this country has drastically changed since the Cold War and the tragic consequences we as a nation are paying for those changes.<br />At the beginning of his career, Baer describes himself as an extremely unlikely candidate for the CIA.  He relates experiences of his training and facts from many events that we just _think_ we know about.  Baer's story makes for very interesting and exciting reading as he describes the thrills and dangers of his first several years as a field officer.  It was an incredibly tough and dangerous job, but a necessary one, as the author adequately demonstrates.  <br />Excitement quickly turns to anger for both the author and the reader.  As the Cold War ends, the reader will learn how the CIA took a dramatic turn, seeking to gain intelligence from satellite surveilance rather than from agents in the field.  Why not?  The technology is available and fewer lives will be lost.  Sounded like a good idea at the time, but not to Baer.  You'll read about how terrorists in the Middle East and in other parts of the world were quickly ignored after the Cold War in favor or special interests in Washington.  You'll also see how close we really were to putting an end to Saddam Hussein forever.  You'll read about many other events that will surprise you, shock you, and make you mad as hell.  'See No Evil' made me experience all those feelings and more.  How could the CIA have fallen to such a level as Baer describes in this book?  What a terrible price we as a nation have paid and continue to pay for our lack of top-notch intelligence.  <br />I'll admit that twenty years ago I pretty much ignored all the fighting and disputes going on in the Middle East.  I ignorantly thought that it didn't concern me, so I didn't give it much thought.  The country was doing well, I was doing well, and that's all that mattered.  I won't makethat mistake again.  I hope that Baer's book is read by millions of Americans and especially the big boys in Washington.  This is not a book to be swept under the rug.  It's a book to be read and heard by America, screaming at the top of our lungs, if need be.	2002-03-18

Thomas Covenant is a leper.  He sees no one and no one wants to see him.  Ever.  Covenant has absolutely no hopes for the future whatsoever.  When he is transported to &quot;The Land,&quot; an other-worldly place where he is viewed as the reincarnation of a legendary hero, Covenant refuses to believe in a land so beautiful or in a people who hail him as a hero.  Yet in the Land, Covenant posseses a power he can't control or even understand.  <br />If Tolkien is a little too light, not hard-hitting enough, 'Lord Foul's Bane' may be exactly what you're looking for.  Donaldson has written a dark, adult fantasy that is sometimes depressing, but always fascinating.  Donaldson's Land is just as believable as Tolkien's Middle Earth, and a lot more satisfying in many ways.  Covenant is the perfect anti-hero and one of the great characters in fantasy literature.  I can't recommend this book (or the series) too highly.  If you enjoy the book, don't stop!  Donaldson wrote a total of 6 books and they're all good.  Enjoy!	2002-02-23

Open the books, start reading, and you'll find the real treasure.<br />If you have seen the movie and are new to the books, be prepared for a few things to be different:<br />1 - Tolkien has to construct his world (Middle Earth) with words.  Sounds ridiculous and obvious, but Tolkien spends a LOT of time describing this world, these people, and their history.  In fact, most readers new to the book will probably find more information than they wanted to know.  Understand, however, that for this world to be believable, Tolkien had to dive in and create a believable world that you could sink your teeth into.  There's a lot of description and it's all important.  Don't get discouraged.<br />2 - The action is not as frequent as it is in the film.  Get used to that.  The action comes, but Tolkien wisely leaves a lot of the detail here up to the reader's imagination.  When it comes down to it, the book is really not about the action as much as it is about the characters and how they behave.  You get a little of this in the film, you get a lot of it in the book.  Savor it.<br />3 - Read 'The Hobbit' first.  Even if you saw the film, you need to read the &quot;introduction&quot; to the series.  It's fun, not too long, and will help you understand the goings-on of Middle Earth.<br />If you are about to undertake the journey of Middle Earth for the first time, I envy you.  &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is one of the great works not only of fantasy, but of all 20th Century literature.  Be patient.  Before you know it, you'll find yourself in the world Tolkien made and loved.  I think you'll love it too.	2002-02-19

To be honest, I thought turning such a powerful story into a novel would lessen its impact.  I was wrong.<br />The novel version of 'Beggars in Spain' begins with a simple premise:  What if science could genetically alter humans so that they needed no sleep?  Think of the advances and discoveries mankind could make, think of all the achievements that would be possible if we never had to sleep for 6, 7, or 8 hours a day.  <BR>The theory becomes a reality for Leisha Camden and many other &quot;sleepless.&quot;  It doesn't take long before the sleepless are shunned by the rest of society and forced to develop their own community.  But the persection doesn't stop there...<br />'Beggars in Spain' has so many things going for it that so many science fiction novels lack.  First (and most important in my mind), Kress gives us believable characters that are interesting.  You actually believe that these people could be real and would be fascinated to meet them.  Leisha is a character I will remember for a long, long time.  Next, Kress does something that I wish more science fiction writers would (or could) do:  She explains how the science in her story works in a way that a non-scientist can understand it!  (Imagine that!)  Let me say for the record that I have an extremely weak science background, but thanks to the author's talent, I felt that I understood the basis for all the science that was included in the story.  In short, I wasn't intimidated at all.  <br />The characters and the understandable science are important, but I was really knocked out by the multitude of questions that are raised by 'Beggars in Spain.'  The book admirably addresses such questions as genetic engineering (How far should science go?), aging, class distinction, euthanasia, community rights,... Kress poses some very difficult questions without backing down from them one bit.  I appreciate the honesty and courage that I'm sure it took to write this book.  It is tremendous.  This is not a novel just for science fiction fans.  For anyone who appreciates good writing and an intelligent story that will stick with you long after you turn the last page, 'Beggars in Spain' will not disappoint.	2002-02-12

Her platform is to clean up the corruption in Colombia that is running rampant in that country.  Betancourt constantly receives death threats.

Massey Sr. Lectures in the History of American Civilization)	Books	5	39	39	N	N	The Queen of Southern Writing	Eudora Welty is considered one the the greatest fiction writers of the 20th century.  Being from Mississippi myself, I am embarrassed to admit that until about four years ago, I had never read any of her work.  After reading 'The Golden Apples' and 'The Optimist's Daughter,' I realized what a treasure I'd missed.  'One Writer's Beginnings' belongs in that treasure chest as well.<br />'One Writer's Beginnings' would probably be better appreciated by readers who have read at least a short story or two by the late Ms. Welty.  (She passed away last year.)  Her style and charm are obvious from the first page, but if this is the first contact a reader has had with Welty, he or she may not appreciate the book fully.  <br />First of all, I should speak to what the book is NOT:  It is not a how-to-be-a-writer book.  It will not teach you how to tighten up your stories, how to plot, how to sell your stories, or anything else of a practical nature in the writing business.  It is not a strict autobiography, although parts of Welty's life are described in detail.  It is not a book to breeze through, even though it comes in at slightly over 100 pages.  <br />What is the book?  It is actually a series of three lectures delivered at Harvard University in 1983 when the writer was 74 years old.  The three parts are titled as follows:<br />I.  Listening - As a child, Welty spent many hours watching and listening to the people around her in Jackson, Mississippi.  She carefully absorbed their stories and how they told them.  She began to listen to and fall in love with words.<br />II. Learning to See - As she stepped outside of her home to visit relatives along with her parents, Welty makes some wonderful discoveries about her family in West Virginia and Ohio.  Time is &quot;a continuous thread of revelation.&quot;<br />III.  Finding a Voice - This lecture is the payoff, describing how Welty evolved as a writer and how her characters came to life.  &quot;The frame through which I viewedthe world changed too, with time.  Greater than scene, I came to see, is situation.  Greater than situation is implication.  Greater than all of these is a single, entire human being, who will never be confined in any frame.&quot;<br />'One Writer's Beginnings' is an amazing, brief look at the long life of a writer and what made her a writer.  Like all of Welty's works, it is not a book to be read quickly, but savored.	2002-01-08

Then the reader is introduced to Alex Cross, the detective who put Soneji away years ago.  Soneji is looking for revenge, while another killer called Mr. Smith is on the loose in Europe.  What's the connection to Cross?  Sounds interesting, I thought.'Cat and Mouse' soon turns into a very predictable thriller with two-dimensional characters and ridiculous action scenes.  Sure, I know this is fiction and a thriller at that, but the action scenes have to contain some believability and logic, and for me they didn't.  These characters have absolutely no style, no color, and no surprises whatsoever.  Cross is the stereotypical widower, ready to take a chance again with the principal of the school his kids attend.  Soneji is the killer who is taking it out on the world because of his abuse as a child.  I don't know about you, but when I read a thriller, I want to be challenged (at least somewhat) and I want to read about interesting characters who are not stereotypes.

Finney's story 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' has been a favorite for many years.  Everyone knows the story:  people in a small California town are not what they seem to be.  People are being replaced by some type of alien that looks and acts just like the real thing.  Finney's original story is still gripping, suspense-filled reading fun, and I enjoyed it a lot.  The edition I read had many references to the year being 1976 and not in the 1950's (when it was actually written).  I wondered if Finney doctored the book a bit to make it fit the 1978 remake.  If so, I wish he hadn't.  The atmosphere and feel of the book are all out of the 50's...the 70's references are out of place.  <br />In this case, I think the original 1956 film is slightly better.  Some parts are different, many are similar, but the feel of the film probably made a better connection with film audiences of the 50's than the book did.  I also think as far as the ending goes, less is better, which is what you get from the film.  I thought the book explained a little too much, and for me, that took away part of the fun.  Still, 'Invasion' the book still continues to be a science fiction favorite and deservedly so.	2001-11-22

Gold's book portrays an innocence that sadly has departed since Sept. 11, which makes the book one to hunger for even more.  The author wonderfully juggles many themes:  Love, ambition, childhood fears, family relationships, fame, good vs. evil, the Secret Service, and the advent of television.  'Carter' is funny, touching, adventurous, mysterious and suspenseful.  Gold masterfully weaves all of these themes together into a very satisfying conclusion.  Start reading and watch the pages disappear.	2001-11-06

We meet Sei-Young, a poor boy who decides to try to lift his family out of poverty by performing demanding work for a Japanese farmer.  Sei-Young's father drinks away the family's money while the mother takes care of Kwan-Young, Sei-Young's little brother.  Life is quite different for Heisook, a young girl with an unusual family:  Her father, although a Christian minister, is somewhat prosperous due to the fact that church offering money buys his family protection from the ruling Japanese authorities.  Heisook's brother is a rebellious, wheels-off teenager, and her mother seems to have more love for the children in the local orphanage than for her own.  Heisook believes that she has faith in God until Communist forces in North Korea change their lives forever.  <br />'To Swim Across the World' offers alternating chapters from both Sei-Young and Heisook from childhood until adulthood.  The book is a fictionalized biography of the Park sisters' parents.  I enjoyed the book very much.  Like other reviewers, I found the book to be a page-turner.  Reading about another culture in a time of distress during our current time of distress was encouraging and soothing.  This is a story about having faith, losing it, and finding it again.  The book can be read by adults and young adults alike.  I think the book could be very valuable especially now for young readers who can discover how other people in other places handle adversity and seemingly overwhelming odds.  A good book for our times and for our faith.  <br />One reviewer from Korea blasted this book, accusing it of being historically inaccurate.  I don't know much about Korean history, but I do know that when I want to learn about it, I'll go to a history book, not a novel.  Good novels are about people and the things they think and feel.  It doesn't have to be historically accurate.  (That's why it'scalled 'fiction!')  If you want to learn about history, pick up a history book.  If you want an enjoyable, touching story, pick up 'To Swim Across the World.'	2001-10-18

Spencer (who is also a better than average cook) is hired by a local university to find a stolen 14th-Century manuscript.  His search leads him down a very slippery path filled with drug dealers, the mob, and of course, murder.<br />When I start any series, I usually begin with the first book and read them in order.  This time I started with &quot;Early Autumn,&quot; the seventh book in the series.  Going to the first book next, I was able to see how the character was going to evolve through the first several books.  While Parker seems to be putting the finishing touches on Spencer, this first case is a good solid adventure.  Things are somewhat slow at times in this first outing, but not too much.  Spencer's moral code of doing the right thing is not altogether clearly locked in yet.  Some of the supporting characters are not quite as colorful or animated as they will become later, but as a whole, Spencer's first adventure gives new readers a good, interesting adventure.	2001-10-09

The book is loaded with valuable information that helped make my running program much, much easier.  The most helpful information for me included common mistakes beginners make, injury prevention, and the mental side of running.  Some reviewers complain that Runner's World magazine is better, which may be true, but what first-time runner wants to subscribe to a year's worth of magazines that arrive once a month and may or may not contain what you need at the beginner level?  Burfoot's book is a great place for any beginning runner to start.	2001-10-01

She suspects her ex-husband is behind it all and sends Spencer to him first.  Spencer reluctantly takes the case and quickly learns that between a neurotic mother and a shady no-good father, young Paul has no interest in what life with either of them has to offer.  Seeing that the parents really don't care about Paul except as a leverage tool to get at each other, Spencer is forced to make a tough and risky decision about the boy's future.  <br />'Early Autumn' is a great story about doing the right thing.  Parker packs a lot into the book's 213 pages:  action, tough guys, tough talk, slimy criminals, how to build a cabin, even ballet!  Spencer is a great detective character who cares about doing the right thing and making honorable choices.  A good, fun read that's over too quickly.	2001-09-29

Binx Bolling is a man nearing 30 years old who thinks things are going pretty well...he has a good job, prospects for female companionship, and a passion for movies.  But Binx really wants to know &quot;What's it all about?&quot;  <br />Percy, who himself is from the Deep South, understands the ways and traditions of Southerners and knows how to communicate it to the reader.  Having spent 34 years of my life in the Deep South, I found my self nodding in agreement with just about every description of people and places Southern.  The entire story is concerned with tradition (especially Southern tradition) vs. change.  Binx is torn between the two, externally and internally.  He is a character hopelessly in despair, yet he doesn't really know it.  He drifts from movie to movie and woman to woman until he finds that caring for someone can change your whole life and your worldview.  What a first novel!  Easily read, but enough for you to think about for a long time.	2001-09-29

A woman hires Kinsey to track down her sister, who stands to inherit money from a deceased relative, if the sister can be located.  The money amounts to very little, so why would anyone want to abduct the missing sister?  In fact, why would her sister even hire a private investigator whose fee would exhaust the inheritance money rather than go to the police?  Hmmmmmm...<br />Grafton provides several quirky &amp; goof-ball characters as well as some nifty twists and turns.  'B' is a much better story than 'A is for Alibi,' and develops Kinsey to a much better extent, showing that she is a character to keep an eye on.  I like the mannerisms Grafton gives her characters...we get to know them through their actions as well as through Kinsey's eyes.  Grafton's descriptions of the California and Florida settings are just enough to give you the feeling of being there, yet leaving enough for the reader to imagine.  A good read.	2001-09-20

Kevin Trudeau's Mega Memory will probably work for some people, but it will not be everything for everyone.  The premise is that if you can visualize concepts for remembering names, numbers, etc., they are much easier to carry with you.  This is probably true, and the beginning chapters can be accomplished very easily and do have limited use, but that's about it.  To be completely successful with the system one would, as the book says, need to practice only 30 minutes a day, but for a very large number of days.  I would slightly recommend part one of the book.  Part two would be an excercise I'd rather forget.  Success would probably come with total immersion, but I'll stick to my day planner, thanks.	2001-08-12

I suppose that ego, pride, and envy are the reasons we have so few of these books to savor.  I'm glad that Truffaut approached Hitchcock on this project.  Film lovers are the better for it.<br />Truffaut's interviews with Hitchcock touch briefly on Hitchcock's early life before jumping right in to discuss the master's films.  All of the director's important films are discussed, as well as some of the unimportant ones.  Although the interviews were conducted in the 1960's, Truffaut does a good job of wrapping up Hitchcock's final films that are not covered in the interview.  <br />My best compliment for the book:  It makes you want to see the films again.  And again.  Hitchcock describes what went into some of his most famous scenes (the cornfield scene from &quot;North By Northwest,&quot; the Madeline scenes from &quot;Vertigo,&quot; and of course the shower scene from &quot;Psycho&quot;), problems with the films, interaction with actors...a wide range of aspects of making films.  I was impressed by the admiration that Truffaut has for Hitchcock, but at the same time, the interviewer is not afraid to disagree with the great master.  This is an open and honest document that film lovers will enjoy.  My only complaint:  I wanted more.  I especially wanted to know more about Hitchcock's relationship with his actors.  This aspect is touched upon, but I wanted a little more.  A very enjoyable read.	2001-08-12

Diane Ravitch has written a monumental work that I hope every parent and teacher in the country will read.  The book's complete title is &quot;Left Back - A Century of Failed School Reforms.&quot;  Just what are these reforms?  They come in many names, but the most recognized name is the progressive education movement.  You might think that such a movement was started by innovative administrators or visionary teachers...no, it was begun by educational &quot;experts,&quot; many of whom have never spent any real time teaching in the real world.  At one point Ravitch quotes an educator, &quot;But compared to other countries, ours is the educational expert's paradise.  Again and again the 'experts' advocate changes to our schools that the public does not support.&quot;  <br />But what kind of changes are we talking about?  Ravitch classifies most of them under one of the following categories: 1 - Schools can and should seek to change in order to help solve society's problems. 2 - Only a small percentage of students need a quality academic education, therefore more &quot;practical&quot; electives should be offered (at the expense of academic subjects). 3 - The practical experience of the student is more important than the acquisition of knowledge.<br />Ravitch gives us a full and complete history of the public schools in America, showing the reader how we have come to be where we are.  This history is crucial to a proper understanding of the progressive movement.  Don't skip any of it.  This is an important work that will be praised by some and ridiculed by others.  You may or may not agree with Ravitch, but she has done her homework and she knows her subject.  <br />I've been a teacher in public schools for nearly 14 years.  The best principal I ever worked for constantly reminded our staff that everything we do as teachers falls into one of two categories:  Teaching &amp; learning or custodial service.  Teaching is the primary reponsibility of teachers, not correctingeach of the ills of society.  Learning is what the students are there for, not to have a &quot;feel-good&quot; experience devoid of knowledge.  Everything else is custodial.  What are your children receiving?  <br />One of the best stories in the book describes an encounter between a man who met a woman whose child was in a progressive school.  The woman was so proud that her children were having a &quot;happy&quot; experience at school.  The man replied that to his relief, his children were being trained to develop their intellect and self-discipline in order to excell in a highly competitive world.  Which would you rather have?	2001-07-25

He has written a tremendous book that has made him Fast Food Public Enemy #1.  Why?  Pick up a copy of &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot; and you'll discover exactly what you eat when you go to a fast food restaurant, where the food comes from, and under what conditions it is prepared.  This information alone is worth the price of the book, but Schlosser gives us much more.  I was saddened and horrified to read of the horrible working conditions that workers in the meat-packing industry must undergo.  I was angry at some of the ways in which fast food restaurants treat their workers.  But most of all, I was struck by how we as a society have literally swallowed the fast food concept, changing the lives of too many Americans for the worse in so many ways.  My only complaint:  I wish Schlosser had broadened his study to include more types of restaurants.  (The main focus of his study is McDonalds.)  Any American (and especially parents) concerned about the general health of the people of this country should read this book.  A real eye-opener.	2001-07-02

The Rise and Decline of Western Thought and Culture	Books	4	97	105	N	N	Still an Important Work 25 years Later	In &quot;How Should We Then Live,&quot; Francis Schaeffer seeks to give an analysis of the events of history and how they have shaped our present cultural philosophies, thoughts, ideas, and beliefs.  Schaeffer begins with the culture of Ancient Rome and leads us all the way through to (written in 1976) the present.  How has our current way of thinking developed?  Through philosophy?  The arts?  Science?  Religion?  The answer is through all of them, and Schaeffer shows how a Christian worldview (or a lack of one) did and continues to affect people and nations.  According to Schaeffer, modern man really only cares about two things:  personal peace and prosperity...at any cost.  How we have arrived here is a very interesting story...<br />Schaeffer himself admits in the introduction that a comprehensive study of the rise and fall of Western thought and culture would be a near impossibility.  He's right.  But many times in the book I think he fell short.  Schaeffer tends to explain concepts during certain periods in history very clearly, then assumes that the reader is familiar with other periods without the same foundation being laid.  Again, as he said, the problem is he can't treat the subject comprehensively in only 258 pages (many of which are photographs).  I also felt that Schaeffer was somewhat uncomfortable in knowing how to fit musical influences into the book.  His musical statements don't seem to support some of his ideas very well at times. (However, he handles the influence of art quite well.)  Also, as with any book examining culture that is 25 years old, much of the material is outdated.  It's a shame that Schaeffer didn't live to see and comment on some of the events of the past decade.  It would have been very interesting to hear him speak of things (such as cloning) which are now very real.  <br />I have read four previous Schaeffer works.  None of the books I have read are very long (well under 300 pages), but some can be a pretty rough road.  &quot;How Should We Then Live&quot; is very readable and most of the time very clear.  The book is well worth your time.	2001-06-13

Washington traces his struggle for an education, and his later challenges and trials as an educator.  His account of the building and molding of the Tuskeegee Institute is one of the most inspiring stories I have read in years.  Washington did not want to have anything handed to him.

Although the reader will have to get used to some 17th-Century language and expressions, the book comes across as a generally easy read.  Guthrie masterfully describes the characteristics of people who have a genuine interest in Christ.  What is the evidence that a person knows Christ?  Do you have doubts?  What is the difference between true believers and pretenders?  Guthrie answers these and many more questions.  This is an essential book for all Christians.	2001-06-09

It is refreshing in that Stephens has no agenda, is not concerned with political correctness, and is not catering to anyone.  The book was written in 1872, just seven years after the end of the Civil War, so the thoughts of that era were very much on the author's mind.  <br />Readers should understand that the book is geared towards students and serves as a general history.  Stephens himself states (although at the end of the book) what the book is NOT:  a study of economic trends, inventions, explorations, etc., although some of these aspects are touched upon.  The best parts of the book are the early chapters concerning the settlement of the colonies and the last few chapters which summarize the Civil War.  A bit too much detail (for me anyway) is given to the Presidential elections.  I would rather have read in more detail about the policies and actions of each President.  Again, understand that this is a general history book, a starting point if you will, and not a detailed study.	2001-05-10

All of these aspects and many more are involved in the lives of many of the world's most famous conductors.  When the author focuses on the theme of the book's subtitle, the book is very informative and interesting.  Many times, however, Lebrecht takes the reader down &quot;rabbit trails&quot; that really have little to do with the given subject.  Like another reviewer, I was surprised at the absence of several conductors, most notably the Chicago Symphony's Fritz Reiner.  All in all, though, an interesting book.	2001-03-31

Asimov has collected eight stories in this anthology that were influential in his own writing.  Asimov read most of these stories when he was about 12 years old, being fortunate enough to devour most of them from pulp magazines that were sold in his father's candy store.  As might be expected with any anthology, some stories are better than others, and some have held up better through the years than others.  Yet these pieces are not included for comparison to current stories, but to show what Asimov read as a young person and how the works influenced him.  Asimov's mini-autobiography alone is worth the price of the book.  After each story, Asimov tells how an idea or a concept from a story led to the formation of one of his own works.  A very interesting idea.  &quot;The Jameson Satellite&quot; is a forerunner of &quot;I, Robot,&quot; and &quot;Submicroscopic&quot; is a small step from &quot;Fantastic Voyage.&quot;  As mentioned by another reviewer, the reader will have to deal with several prejudices from the time these stories were written (especially racial), but overall this book is a great insight into what makes Asimov Asimov.	2001-03-06

When the businessman is murdered, the Northerner flees to America with the guns...and the businessman's daughter.  But did he kill the businessman?  Monk and Hester are up to the task of sorting the whole thing out...or are they?<br />I found the first third of the book to be very exciting, especially the scenes that occur in America.  Monk, for the first time, now becomes graphically aware of what Hester has seen and experienced as he watches the brutal battles of the Civil War.  (Monk also learns more about his forgotten past in this volume.)  As Monk and Hester search for answers in America, they learn a lot about themselves.  <br />Sadly, after Monk and Hester arrive back to England, the book really drags down.  Perry just keeps hammering the same clues over and over again until the reader finally doesn't care who is exposed as the murderer (although it's fairly easy to figure out).  Monk's wit and intellect are usually sharp as a tack, but he really seems slow-witted in figuring out what's going on in this story.  After her return from America, Hester might as well change the sheets on beds in hospital rooms...she has very little to do with the remainder of the story.  The courtroom scenes in this story are the least inspired of all the Monk stories thus far.  &quot;Slaves of Obsession&quot; feels like a book that was well thought out for about the first half of the story.  After that, it feels like the ending was thrown together in time to meet a deadline.  Considering how very good the three previous Monk books were, &quot;Slaves of Obsession&quot; comes as a major disappointment.	2001-02-27

Emma Watson is a research physician who, after years of training, is finally granted a chance to study living organisms in a NASA space station.  Her maiden voyage is quickly spoiled, however, when a nasty group of organisms from the sea are discovered aboard the station, causing terror and death among the crew.  Was this an accident or bio-terrorism?  That is the question that runs throughout the entire book, keeping millions of reader up at all hours of the night.  <br />&quot;Gravity&quot; is a very good thriller with many strong points and only one weak one.  The characters are written very well.  Gerritsen has gone to a lot of effort to clearly define the characters and how they think, act, and feel.  That in itself is refreshing.  I was also very impressed with the medical/biological aspect of the book, which is not too technical for the average medical idiot like me.  The suspense and thrills are very good and kept me turning the pages.  The only negative for me is the relationship between Emma and her ex-husband Jack.  The relationship is a key point in the story, but I found it extremely predictable.  Even with this flaw, I found the story exciting.	2001-02-22

When I picked up &quot;A Coffin for Dimitrios,&quot; I had no idea that the suspense level of a 60+ year old book would be so high.  Needless to say, Ambler's book was a welcome surprise. <br />Charles Latimer is a British writer of detective stories who, pretty much due to boredom, finds himself hanging out in Turkey in the 1930's.  While in Turkey, Latimer hears from a Turkish official the story of an elusive, shifty criminal called Dimitrios.  Partly to gather material for a new novel, and partly out of personal curiosity, Latimer attempts to trace the movements of Dimitrios during the past several years.  In doing so, the writer learns that the career of Dimitrios includes much criminal activity including murder, blackmail, white slavery, and much more.  The more Latimer learns, the more he must know.  Latimer's journey takes him to many different and dangerous locations as he learns that knowledge of Dimitrios can itself be a very deadly thing.  <br />This is the first Eric Ambler book I have read.  I hope it is not the last.  Ambler has the ability to write about exotic locations and different cultures in a way that makes them come alive.  The characters are believable and colorful at the same time, without becoming comic.  I think I can honestly say that Ambler packs more suspense in every page than most thriller writers today can place in an entire book.  The book is not a flashy story with lots of gimmicks, but a real well-thought out suspense novel that deserves to be read by anyone who enjoys a good suspense story.	2001-02-12

I was somewhat surprised to find that the book chronicles an actual event in 16th-century France.  During that time, a peasant man leaves his family and property, disappearing without a trace.  Years later the man returns, but some believe him to be an impostor.  Is the story fact or legend?  <br />The author originally gathered research on this story to help construct a movie script for a French film, but as her research progessed, she began to wonder why Martin Guerre left his home and family.  Where did he go?  And what happened to his wife, family, and the people from his village when he left?  <br />Unlike some of the previous reviewers, I very much enjoyed &quot;The Return of Martin Guerre.&quot;  It is a short book that can be quickly read in just a few short hours.  Now for the pros and the cons:  On the positive side, I thought the book read like a good mystery novel.  I was very interested in the author's research and findings and the way in which they were presented.  Her descriptions of the people and customs (especially their laws and religious beliefs) are very good, and crucial to a proper understanding of the story.  On the negative side, the author tells you how the story ends in the introduction.  Sure, I know this is history, but many readers who are unfamiliar with the story may be disappointed to learn the end result after only a few pages.  Also I thought Davis spent a little too much time describing the written accounts of the two men who saw (and were involved with) the trial.  Overall, an interesting book about a very unusual case involving the disappearance of Martin Guerre.	2001-01-22

Lewis only wrote children's stories, fantasy and science fiction tales probably wouldn't be reading this book anyway.  But if they did, they would find a book written by one of the 20th century's great thinkers.  &quot;Miracles&quot; begins with an early quote that sets the tone for the rest of the book:  &quot;What we learn from experience depends on the kind of philosophy we bring to experience.&quot;  Two experiences or worldviews are contrasted - the Naturalists who believe that nothing exists except Nature, and the Supernaturalists who believe in something beyond Nature.  Lewis spends quite a bit of time examining the two views.  Readers may think that too much time is devoted to this subject before getting to a discussion of miracles themselves, but the time spent is a necessary foundation to everything that follows.  <br />How exactly do you define a miracle?  Lewis defines a miracle as &quot;an interference with Nature by supernatural power.&quot;  Lewis then presents many questions.  Are miracles in contrast to the laws of Nature?  What exactly ARE the laws of Nature?  Are exceptions possible?  How does probability fit into the discussion of miracles?  Later in the book, Lewis focuses on three categories of miracles:  The Grand Miracle (God becoming man in Jesus Christ), Miracles of the Old Creation (miracles of fertility, healing, destruction, etc.), and Miracles of the New Creation (miracles of reversal, glory, resurrection).  This last portion of the book I found to be the most fascinating as Lewis examines several specific miracles from the Old and New Testaments.    <br />&quot;Miracles&quot; is a relatively short book, but properly read will take a little time to read.  Take time to absorb and contemplate each chapter.  Lewis left us with a lot of things to think about here, regardless of your worldview.  You may not agree with everything Lewis says, but it will cause you to think long after you've closed the book.	2001-01-13

The book has been labeled &quot;Science Fiction/Fantasy,&quot; but it is much more.  The novel's hero/Everyman Maskull starts out on a journey to the planet Tormance, but is quickly separated from his two traveling companions.  Maskull's journey takes him on an unusual search for the discovery of the truths of the planet and of his own being.  He meets several unusual but memorable characters who are so interesting they could each become the subjects of their own novels.  The entire book deals with a search for the truth and the struggle between good and evil...and it's not always easy to distinguish which character is on which side.  <br />This is a vast over-simplification of the story.  The novel is rich, bold, and imaginative.  The reader has absolutely no idea what is about to happen next as the story moves.  I found the unpredictability (especially in light of current novels) very refreshing.  Several reviewers are hoping for a film version of the book.  Some novels should never reach the screen and this is one of them.  First, no studio could produce the special effects necessary to bring the novel to the screen without cheapening the story.  Second, I don't want to see George Clooney running around attempting to contemplate the meaning of life while playing a caricature of Maskull.  Don't wait for the movie...read the novel and enjoy.	2001-01-08

You're a young officer in your 20's, in charge of five other GI's, all fairly young men as well.  You are assigned to occupy an abandoned French chateau as an observation post near the German front.  None of you have much real combat experience.  It's cold and you're all scared to death.  As if you weren't all anxious enough, you see signs that the Germans know exactly where you are.<br />Such is the premise of &quot;A Midnight Clear.&quot;  Wharton has written a fascinating tale of young men at war.  These young men really don't know what war or life is all about.  The book is suspenseful, moving, tragic, and well-written.  Highly recommended.	2001-01-03

Tim Riley's commentary on Dylan focuses on the music rather than the man.  This focus starts fairly well, aside from Riley trying to impress us with his vocabulary.  Dylan's early work (from his debut until about Highway 61 Revisited) receives a fairly thorough treatment as Riley tries to &quot;get inside&quot; the mind of Dylan (which is probably not a very wise thing to do in the first place).  Even if you don't agree with Riley, his ideas are interesting...at least for awhile.  After reading the book, it seems that Riley believes that Dylan hasn't written anything worth listening to since &quot;Blood on the Tracks.&quot;  Unfortunately the author all but ignores some of Dylan's most significant contributions past 1975.  (Riley spends nearly 250 pages on the period from Dylan's debut until 1975.  From 1975 on only gets 50 pages.)  This book was a super disappointment by an author who seems to have an axe to grind.  The work is saved by giving a good bibliography and an even better discography.	2001-01-03

Just simple life as a kid, including adventures with your best friend, your dog.  Morris describes his youth with his dog Skip as a simple, funny, and touching memory which we can all embrace.  If you've ever owned a dog, you'll love reading Skip's adventures.  If you have never had the privilege, you'll be strongly tempted to go out and buy or adopt your own Skip.  <br />If you saw the film version of the book, understand that much of the movie was &quot;Hollywood-ized.&quot;  Even so, I think most readers will enjoy the book even more than the film.	2000-12-12

Boylan has been involved in many cases, including the Polly Klass kidnapping, the Oklahoma City Unabomber, and the tragic Susan Smith murders.  Boylan's methods, while unorthodox, have helped to capture many criminals and to cause &quot;tried and true&quot; police methods of criminal identification to be called into question.  <br />Part of the book naturally serves as an autobiography, but Boylan does a pretty good job of keeping the focus on the cases themselves.  Some readers may wish Boylan would refrain from commenting on her personal life and the sacrifices she has made, but I think that's an important part of the story.  Boylan doesn't really like the job she does, but she can't say no.  The job is too important.  Whether her gift is a blessing or a curse is for you to decide.	2000-12-12

Nathan's Run is a very good thriller about a 12-year old boy who escapes from a youth detention center after killing a guard in self-defense.  (Or was it self-defense???)  In an ordinary thriller, the author would follow a formula that the reader would probably be able to easily figure out.  That doesn't happen here.  Gilstrap gives us just enough information to keep us turning the pages to find out what happens to Nathan next.  All is not as it seems in Nathan's life.  Anxious to tell someone his story, Nathan telephones a national radio talk show.  Improbable?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  But it is suspenseful and riveting. <br />Nathan's Run may not be for everyone.  There's lots of violence and profanity, but there's also quite a lot that Gilstrap has to say about our society and where we're headed.  Also Nathan is one of the most unforgettable characters in adult fiction.  A good read, but not a great ending, thus earning four stars instead of five.	2000-11-28

It's been a long time since I've read a book that is honest, biblical, practical, and pulls no punches in dealing with the daily struggles that men face.  Morley has done a wonderful job in each of these short chapters of facing tough issues head-on.  In the book, you will find honest and frank discussions of the following topics:  Relationships with family, relationships with friends, dealing with anger, our attitudes at the workplace, finances, our thought lives, and much more.  Each chapter has questions for consideration (or discussion if the book is used in group study).  R. C. Sproul says in the book's introduction that the book should be read by the wife after the husband has read it, but don't let the wife read it BEFORE the husband!  Read it, men, and you'll know why.  This book is essential for men who want to grow spiritually.	2000-11-16

Wolfe, on his way to an orchid competition in upstate New York, takes an unexpected stop when Archie crashes the car in the middle of nowhere.  While stranded, Wolfe and Archie encounter a prize-winning bull worth $45,000, a wise-cracking female named Lily Rowan, and of course, murder.  <br />Like the previous Wolfe outing &quot;Too Many Cooks,&quot; Stout places the heavyset detective out of his element, and the results are wildly entertaining.  Among the highlights:  Wolfe drinking warm beer (Horrors!), Archie in jail for the first time, and many unsavory characters.  With this novel, Stout really has a good grip on his characters and how they behave.  Great fun!	2000-11-14

Such a revolution for independence seems impossible.  Yet, the hero of the book, Manuel (with the assistance of a computer named Mike) slowly begins to see that revolution just may be possible.  <br />Years ago I read several Heinlein books, but this is the first one I've read in a long time.  The book works on many levels.  As a science-fiction novel, I would say the books succeeds quite well.  While definitely not a space-opera, Heinlein packs the novel with plenty of action and adventure.  The book also works well as a mystery, satire, character study, and even as a diagram for political revolution.  As always, Heinlein has some very interesting (if not a little wacky) ideas about how a society should be run.  Sometimes it's fun trying to figure out whether Heinlein is stating part of his world-view or simply making fun of us as a society.  <br />This is a great book to read right now.  Ever since the Presidential Election fiasco has been in the forefront of the news, many people have said that our way of voting may be changing.  Maybe even more than our voting practices will change.  Heinlein's book is basically all about change.  Sometimes things need to change.  Sometimes we think that things must change and we try to force change.  Reading this book made me think a lot about the changes that might take place in the country in the coming months and years.  After you read the book, do some thinking.  Every change brings with it consequences and the chance that the change may not be exactly what we thought it would be.  Happy reading.	2000-11-13

It is, as it's subtitle suggests, a series of conversations between Stone and author Patner.  The book's short chapters are basically Stone's ideas on a wide variety of topics ranging from the ancient Greeks to Free Speech to the Cold War to the Reagan administration.  Some of the topics were interesting to me, but not all.  The conversations do, however, give the reader a fair insight of what Stone was like.  Of course, the book presupposes that the reader knows something of Stone, a somewhat radical journalist during a large part of the 20th century.  (A brief biography is included near the end of the book.)  It would seem that Patner's main purpose in writing the book is to give Stone the recognition that he has been denied in the world of journalism.  According to Patner, Stone was his own man, suspicious of and distrusting both of the mainstream political parties in this country.  Although Stone was something of a radical, many people depended on Stone's interpretation of the news in his own weekly publication.  He saw the world for them.  <br />For those interested in journalism and/or familiar with Stone, Patner's book will most likely be very interesting.  As a way to discover who I.F. Stone was, reading the book is sort of like searching for your lost car keys on a football field at night without a flashlight.	2000-11-02

It seemed that the information was good, but I didn't think the organization (or perhaps the flow) of the material was helpful.  Either Tartaglia changed or I got a better handle on his style.  Starting with the third chapter, my interest increased all the way until the final chapter.  <br />Tartaglia has submitted ten character flaws for discussion.  There's a little something for everyone.  The chapter titles are:   1 - Addicted to Being Right, 2 - Raging Indignation, 3 - Fixing Blame and Nurturing Resentments, 4 - The Dread Seekers - Worry and Fear, 5 - Intolerance, 6 - The Poor Me or Martyr Syndrome, 7 - Self-Regard Run Riot, 8 - The Excuse for Everything-Inadequacy, 9 - Hypercritical Fault Finders, 10 - Chronic Dishonesty - The Trap<br />At the very least, I can assure you that if you read the book honestly, you will learn some things about yourself that you won't like.  But Tartaglia gives some good advice on what you can do about these character flaws.  He often relates the remedies to Biblical principles, which I appreciated, although I'm not sure that I agree with some of his interpretations.  If you are honest with yourself, you'll learn something about yourself and your worldview after reading Flawless.	2000-10-31

In Rex Stout's fifth book in the series, Wolfe engages in two activites he detests:  leaving the confines of his home and travel by any type of machinery (a train in this case).  Wolfe and Archie travel to Kanawha Spa, West Virginia, where Wolfe has been invited to speak before a group of master chefs.  Wolfe encounters more than just gourmet food when one of the chefs is murdered.  <br />Stout really has a lot of fun with the story and characters as Wolfe's confrontational manner begins to emerge in the series.  The characters are always colorful, but the supporting cast of chefs, wives, servants, and others is also enjoyable.  Some of the most interesting books in the series are those in which Wolfe leaves the brownstone and is absent from his comforts:  the plant rooms, his cook Fritz, his beer, his office.

It's very hard to talk about the plot, except that it is largely a reflection of an old man on his life experiences.  The book says so many things that almost overwhelm the reader, but I imagine looking back over a lifetime of experiences can be overwhelming.  I recently read an interview with Wolfe in which he said that authors often reveal clues several times in their books.  He only reveals a clue once.  He presupposes that the reader is smart enough to stay with him on his level.  The ability to do that, at least for me, was difficult, but the journey was extremely worthwhile.	2000-10-01

Zinsser gives many examples from writers that support his statement  that writing is helpful in all subjects in the curriculum:  science,  history, music, math...MATH???

White's  book contains lots of useful answers to many of the questions that  Americans might have about the Japanese system.  White begins by examining  the differences in Japanese/American family structure and values.  The  family is actually the key to the whole educational process in Japan.  The  reader will run across many other interesting differences between the two  education systems.  The book is not, however, a &quot;which system is  better, theirs or ours?&quot; study, although systems are compared and  contrasted.  The study shows us how and why the Japanese get the results  they get.  The Japanese parents, however, will be the first to tell you  that the system is far from perfect.  Would their system work in America?   Would the adoption of Japanese methods at least improve our system?  Read  and decide for yourself.  A very interesting study.	2000-09-07

(A brief bio is included in the  Bantam Crime Line series.)  He published his very first Nero Wolfe novel at  the age of 48, after having completed extraordinary careers as a warrant  officer on Theodore Roosevelt's yacht, a sightseeing guide, a bookkeeper,  and devising a banking system.  (Whew!)  While &quot;Fer-De-Lance&quot; is  not the best Wolfe story, it is the first.  I originally read all the  novels as I found them and am now reading them in chronological order.  It  really doesn't matter what order you take them in.  Just try one or two.   For those who are unfamiliar with the Wolfe novels, Nero Wolfe is a New  York private detective who detests work, spends four hours a day  cultivating his orchids, drinks gallons of beer, and tolerates women only  when absolutely necessary.  His assistant, Archie Goodwin, does the legwork  for Wolfe.  Goodwin is a good looking, wise-cracking, milk-drinking foil  for Wolfe.  Other assorted characters appear from time to time who are just  as colorful.  The great thing about the Wolfe novels is the way that Stout  brings each character to life.  To be honest, you really don't care that  much &quot;whodunnit&quot; because the characters and atmosphere are so  entertaining.  A great, great series.  If you've never tried them, what are  you waiting for?	2000-09-06

Not the best of the Wolfe books, but  certainly an enjoyable reading experience.  I can't say the same for the  audiobook version.  The reader (His name I have forgotten.) sounds as if he  has never read a Wolfe novel.  He misses Archie Goodwin's narrative  character completely, reading the book like a Shakespearian actor would  read rap lyrics.  The reader's only redeeming quality is in his reading of  Wolfe's lines, which is tolerable.  Book - four stars, reading - 2.	2000-09-06

He covers just about all the bases from Tolkien to Stephen King to authors  who are also well-known science fiction writers.  You may not agree with  Pringle's choices, they are so varied.  I found myself in disagreement in  few areas, but I must say that I was shocked to read that Pringle believes  that Stephen R. Donaldson's Chronicles of Thomas Covenant is &quot;an  unearned epic.&quot;  I also felt that Pringle tends to have a British  bias, omitting several American authors and works.  All in all, a good  resource for expanding your fantasy reading.	2000-09-05

Pringle's list of the 100 best science fiction novels starts with Orwell's  1984, giving brief descriptions of each novel.  Also helpful is a summary  of each novel's first and most recent editions, American and British.   Thanks to Mr. Pringle, I have been introduced to many great science fiction  classics, most recently &quot;The Year of the Quiet Sun&quot; by Wilson  Tucker.  The only complaint I have is that Pringle sometimes gives away too  much of the plot.	2000-09-05

It's really too bad that most children who love the adventures of Indiana  Jones have probably never read (or even heard of) Allan Quatermain and KING  SOLOMON'S MINES.  This is where it all started!  Haggard's first novel  chronicles the adventures of Quatermain (okay, so maybe he's not as cool as  Indiana Jones), Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good as they search South  Africa for Sir Henry's brother, who has vanished while searching for King  Solomon's treasure.<br />The novel is the real treasure.  The story, while  obviously written many years ago (1885), is still fresh and exciting.  It  was fun to discover this story as a 38-year old kid!  Any age will enjoy  it.  And what a great adventure story to read to your kids instead of  taking them to the latest action/adventure junker playing at your local  theatre.	2000-09-04

The story  has very little to do with the boy's invisibility, but focuses more on a  computer which takes control of the plans of a group of scientists.  Very  dated, but somewhat entertaining.	2000-09-03

Everest Disaster	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Heroes and Villains	This book already has 921 reviews, so why add another?  Maybe I saw  something a little different, maybe not.  Krakauer's account of the doomed  1996 expedition to the top of Mt. Everest is an extremely enlightening and  interesting document.  The author bears his soul to us in the introduction:   part of the reason for this book is for Krakauer to attempt to come to  grips with the events that happened on the Everest climb.  When things  started to get out of control, who were the heroes and who was looking out  for themselves?  I found the book an interesting account of the disaster,  but even more than this, a study in human nature and motives.  <br />As I  began the book, I thought, &quot;Why would anyone REALLY want to climb  Everest, with all of the multitude of dangers involved?&quot;  Is it the  old cliche &quot;because it is there,&quot; is it the thrill of adventure,  or is it something more?  After reading the book, I came away thinking that  an element of pride and selfishness (with some climbers) was involved.   Some were obviously eager to help others reach their goal.  Some were  obviously not.  Does the thought of the reward so conquer the minds of  those who attempt this feat that logical reasoning goes out the window?   One of the interesting aspects of reading the book is in trying to get into  the minds of the climbers.  Why is each person really there?  Think about  it as you read.  <br />Toward the end, one of the Sherpas questions the act of  climbing Everest at all.  So do I.  I kept thinking that there are probably  some places on this planet where man has no right to be.  It's a humbling  story that tells us that we are ultimately not in control.  There's  something bigger, and it's not a mountain.	2000-09-01

California's Zodiac killer began his reign of terror in the late  1960's and was never caught.  He never used the same method twice, he sent  taunting letters to the police, left many clues, and yet was never found.   Graysmith does an outstanding job of making the book read like a highly  charged suspense novel, but you have to keep saying to yourself,  &quot;These things REALLY happened!&quot;  The Zodiac is at the top of the  list when it comes to intelligent, calculating, cold-blooded killers.  It  still gives me a chill thinking about the messages that Zodiac wrote in the  ciphers.  The most gripping scenes are the stories told by the (few)  survivors.  I wouldn't want to know the nightmares these people have had to  endure over the past 30 years.  Graysmith also gives his opinion on who he  thinks is/was Zodiac.  Again...read it in the DAYTIME!	2000-08-31

The man was in a category all by himself.  Most writers live to write ONE  great work...Lewis wrote many including the Narnia Chronicles (NOT just for  children!), The Screwtape Letters, Mere Christianity and many, many others.   The Great Divorce is my second favorite Lewis work, just (barely) behind  Till We Have Faces.  Lewis introduces the work by citing Blake's concept of  the marriage of heaven and hell, then writing about their divorce.  Many of  the details of the book have been cited by other reviewers, so I will only  add that the book is a wonderful, thoughtful portrait of the human  condition from the mind of a brilliant thinker.  Enjoy.	2000-08-25

The novel is set in the 17th century.  Two  Portuguese Catholic priests journey into Japan with two goals in mind:  To  minister to the Japanese, and to find their former mentor, a priest named  Ferreira, who may or may not have apostatized.  <br />Silence is a  well-balanced work.  The story is deeply moving without becoming  heavy-handed.  The characters are very well thought out and developed.   Endo uses a very interesting technique in this novel:  The first several  chapters are narrated by one of the priests.  We see the events that  develop through his eyes and how they affect him. About halfway through the  book, the priest is no longer narrator, but perhaps we can see inside his  soul better from another's vantage point.  This is a book that I will think  about for a long, long time.	2000-08-23

Blauner's main character Jake, a New York lawyer, finds himself in  such a tight spot.  I won't disclose any further plot details, but I think  that most readers will find the story fast-paced and exciting for the first  half of the book.  I was disappointed, however, in how the story developed  in the second half of the book:  I thought it was somewhat predictable and  also thought the ending presented more problems than it solved.  (Perhaps  this was Blauner's intent.)  The relationship between Jake and his family  include some very good moments, but the scenes of conflict don't really  lead anywhere.  Blauner is obviously a talented writer with an exciting  style, but the ending for me was a disappointment.	2000-08-15

When you start reading the first book in any series of novels, you always  have to make a decision at some point as to whether or not you will  continue to read the next book(s).  For me, the decision to continue with  the series came very early, probably in the first 50 pages.  O'Brian paints  a wonderful picture of Captain Aubrey, a very interesting and colorful  commander, his new friend and ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin, and the rest  of the crew of the Sophie.  Let me say that going into the book, I had very  little knowledge of the Napoleonic era, ships, or the sea.  I really didn't  think that I would enjoy the book, but I was wrong.  I was fascinated with  every aspect of the book.  The characters, the atmosphere, the action...all  of the book is first-rate.  I'm glad I've got 19 more books in the series  left to enjoy, but I'm afraid the pages will turn all too quickly.	2000-08-15

I was VERY wrong!  Alistair Begg does a wonderful job of telling the story  of Joseph, Jacob's favorite son.  (Anyone thinking that today's families  are all mixed up should see how Jacob's family beats anything we hear about  in our day.)  Many of us have been through hard times, but I doubt any of  us have experienced the hardships that Joseph dealt with.  Every chapter is  full of lessons for our lives, no matter what problems we are struggling  with.  Begg's writing is clear and easy to read, yet very convicting.   Highly recommended!	2000-07-25

Pink's &quot;The Life of David&quot; is a wonderful study in the life of the great King of Israel.  The book can be used in so many ways:  individual study, group study, or family/private devotional.  Each chapter  is short, about 6-8 pages, but Pink places rich treasures in each chapter.   We read of David's faithfulness, his love for God, his triumphs, and yes,  his failures and periods of unfaithfulness.  What a powerful look into the  life of David with tremendous application for all Christians today.	2000-06-18
