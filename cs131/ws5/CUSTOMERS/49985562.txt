Just as civil law governs our public entities, canon law governs how the Church operates.<br /><br />As a former Evangelical Lutheran, I found the book very interesting. By reading how the Church approaches particular circumstances one can more easily understand why the Church teaches the things that it does and come to appreciate the Church's consistency.<br /><br />Catholics and non-Catholics will find it helpful for answering such common questions as:<br /><br />- Is it okay to have one godparent?<br /><br />- Who may serve as a child's baptismal sponsor?<br /><br />- What is required of a godparent?<br /><br />- Who can use the title of Catholic?<br /><br />- Can the priesthood be taken away from a priest?<br /><br />- May a layperson give a homily?<br /><br />- Why doesn't the Church butt out of the government's making of public policy?<br /><br />With or without knowing it, canon law affects your daily life as a Catholic. Vere explains how. He provides lucid explanations of canon law, and offers responses to situations that lay Catholics often find themselves in. He also informs Catholics of their rights and responsibilities, and explains how canon law extends privileges to non-Catholics, especially with regard to marriage, divorce, annulments and remarriage. In the case of divorced, non-Catholics, for example, the Church must investigate whether the previous marriage was valid.<br /><br />Those privileges also extend in the case of funerals. Canon 1183, paragraph 3, for example, permits a funeral in the Catholic Church for a baptized non-Catholic whose own minister is not available.<br /><br />If you'd like to know more about the responsibilities of laypeople, priests, or bishops, you'll find Surprised by Canon Law a fascinating book.Law a fascinating book.	2005-06-16

Written in a simple, straight-forward style with an abundance of Scripture references, this book is the perfect guide to the film.<br />As well it should.<br />One of the film's collaborators - Tom Allen, who was intimately involved with the film's fundraising and promotion - helped create the book. You'll see his name listed among the credits near the end of the film.<br />The first press-run, of 160,000, sold out before the book was off the press. As a result of the demand, and the most-commonly asked question, the second printing and all subsequent versions of the book contain the answer to the demon-with-child question.<br />As of this writing, the book has sold more than 300,000 copies. Based on the number of incoming orders, the publisher expects that it will sell at least 1 million.<br />Created by Tom Allen, Dr. Marcellino D'Ambrosio, Matthew Pinto, Mark Shea, and Dr. Paul Thigpen (who has a reflection book of his own out on The Passion), the book closely follows the film and its major scenes (from the Garden of Gethsemane to the Resurrection) answering many questions raised by the film.<br />Priced as a give-away, the publisher has made it extremely easy for theater-goers, churches, or individuals to purchase the books in bulk to give away at screenings. In fact, my wife and I purchased 100 copies to give away at a local screening. I could have used three times that number.<br />The books are written in such a way that they would work well for small-group faith-sharing or Bible study discussions. The second part of the book makes the case for Christ, and offers suggestions for what viewers can do with what they have just seen.<br />An appendix includes the Sorrowful Mysteries of the Rosary, the Stations of the Cross, and the Seven Last Words of Christ, upon which the film is based. Finally, a resource bibliography at the end directs readers to further books and resources that would be helpful in a person's journey with Christ.<br />Christians and non-Christians will benefit greatly from the insights that this book offers into Mel Gibson's film.>The books are written in such a way that they would work well for small-group faith-sharing or Bible study discussions.

Want to give your children or other children whom you love a precious gift? Give them this book! It's one they'll read as children and they'll read 40 years from now to their own children. It's not only a beautiful story, but one that will strengthen their faith.<br />Wonderfully written by Josephine Nobisso and luminously illustrated by Katalin Szegedi, The Weight of a Mass, is an original cultural folk tale based upon a true story. The story reads and looks like a fairy tale.<br />A ragged, destitute widow arrives at the kingdom's prosperous bakery and begs only a crust of bread in exchange for offering a royal wedding Mass for the baker.<br />The baker scoffs and tears off a tiny piece of tissue paper on which he writes the words: One Mass, intending to place them it on the scale to find out the value of a Mass.<br />Much to his surprise, when he drops a piece of old bread on the other side of the scale, it does not tip. So, he enlists his son to stack more and more baked goods on top of the scale. Out come cherry topped cupcakes, marzipan apple, filled chocolates, poppy seed cakes, rolls, donuts, fruitcakes, cream cakes, berry tarts, poached pears, plum pudding, candied fruits, almond confetti, crsuhed walnuts, and eventually the royal wedding cake.<br />The father, his son, the old woman, and others in the kingdom come to learn the weight of a Mass.<br />The story includes an author's postscript recounting the original story as told by Father Stanislaus from Luxembourg who tells of a conversation between a butcher and a Captain of the Forest Guards that was interrupted by an old woman begging a morsel of meat in exchange for a Holy Mass intention.  As a result of the miracle, the Captian began attending Mass daily and one of his sons later received a calling to the priesthood.<br />I cannot say praise this book enough. It's a genre that is sorely needed in children's literature. Not only is it a beautiful book, but it teaches about the richness of the Mass and the priceless presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist.<br />The paintings are wonderful, particularly those of an arched interior of the Cathedral and the bishop holding up the Eucharist at the wedding Mass.<br />Do yourself a favor. Purchase this book for your children, your grandchildren, and any other children whom you love.the priceless presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist.<br />The paintings are wonderful, particularly those of an arched interior of the Cathedral and the bishop holding up the Eucharist at the wedding Mass.<br />Do yourself a favor.

Thus begins Atticus' journey south to Resurreccion, Mexico to retrieve his son's body.<br />However, when he arrives, all is not what it seems. As Atticus puts the pieces of the puzzle together, he begins to suspect murder.<br />The first half of the novel unravels like an unexpected murder mystery, taking the reader along various paths and turns. The last half of the novel is written from a first-person perspective.<br />Hansen ably recasts the Prodigal Son story, helping bring a contemporary spin to the tale. By so doing, he allows the reader to imagine the \\"failings\\" of the son and the love of the father in a much clearer way. Hansen has a way with words even when he tends to over-describe at times.<br />His male characters are far better developed than his female. So obsessed with the physical beauty of Renata in the book's first half, she comes across as more of a stereotype than a character.<br />Overall, the novel is compelling. It's a nice mix of artsy-novel and murder mystery rolled into one.	2002-12-02

Written in the genre of the apologetic's novel, the likes of How Firm a Foundation have not been seen perhaps since Cardinal John Henry Newman's novel Loss and Gain.<br />Marcus Grodi's novel revolves around the life of Stephen LaPointe - a Congregational pastor who finds himself at a crossroads. In a story familiar to most converts, LaPointe discovers that his preconceived belief, that the Bible alone is a sufficient foundation for his life, suddenly no longer holds true. This discovery sets him on an irreversible course towards the Catholic Church.<br />Naturally, how LaPointe wrestles with his questions of faith impact not only himself, but also all those around him - his loving, but troubled wife, Sara, whom is haunted by a secret in her own past, their two sons, his pastoral colleagues, and his parishioners, most especially Walter Horscht, a passionate yet confused father and husband. The novel effectively builds to a climactic confrontation between LaPointe and Horscht.<br />Essentially a conversion story, How Firm a Foundation brings to the story not only Grodi's own conversion experience, but also the experiences of the hundreds he has interviewed through his apostolate, the Coming Home Network, and on his popular EWTN television program. Therefore, the novel carries an air of authenticity. LaPointe's interactions, especially those with his colleagues, ring true. We realize that the story we are reading is the story of so many others whom have gone before.<br />One of the most enjoyable sections of the book involves Stephen's conversations with Catholic priest, Father Bourque. Here we can clearly see the intellectual wrestling that faces LaPointe. His questions threaten not only the faith of his youth, but also his marriage and family.<br />Because the novel draws heavily from Grodi's own life, in some places it is difficult to distinguish fiction from fact. One example includes a passage where pastor LaPointe performs a kind of exorcism on a mute woman - a true-to-life incident that Grodi once faced as a pastor. In addition, although not named, Grodi's own apostolate figures in the novel, as do the thinly-veiled names of real Catholics.<br />The novel serves as a stealth apologetic in that Grodi makes use of authentic sources. Most of the books referenced and excerpted from in the story - books by James Cardinal Gibbons, Karl Keating, the early Church Fathers, and anti-Catholic Loraine Boettner, for example - are real books. Grodi generously quotes from the books, also utilizing Scripture references to prove his point. Additionally, there is nothing about the book which would lead someone to believe that they were picking up something overtly Catholic.<br />Yet, it should be noted that Grodi has written this book for a very particular audience -Protestant pastors. Herein lies the book's major weakness. It suffers from myopia. So focused on the life of a pastor and his church, LaPointe's character lacks true depth. We are given a glimpse of the life of those who live in the world of the pastorate, yet the reader is not given a sense of how LaPointe's family fits into the larger culture that surrounds them. The details of daily life seem missing. One might ask, \\"what do the characters do for fun?\\" At certain points along the way, the story gets lost at the expense of trying to prove a point.<br />While Marcus Grodi's first novel is not great literature, it still makes for enjoyable reading. At times the narrative is clich&eacute;. At one point, sweat drips off Pastor LaPointe's forehead as he gives a sermon, and in another a car flips over and bursts into flames. It's easy to overlook the errors as those of a first-time novelist. Overall, the story compels the reader to continue forward. The second edition is recommended, as the first is filled with many spelling and grammatical errors.<br />Catholic readers will come to a deeper appreciation of their faith. Non-Catholics at the very least will enjoy a fast-moving tale.At the most, they might be brought one step closer to the Church. Clearly, that is Grodi's purpose. By all accounts, the novel appears to be succeeding.  To date the Coming Home Network has received more than 100 letters confirming as such, as well as strong praise from Bishop Paul Dudley. To my way of thinking, if the book leads just one person to the Church, then it's all worthwhile.he most, they might be brought one step closer to the Church. Clearly, that is Grodi's purpose.

I guarantee that they will have you in tears.<br />They include:<br />- The story of Janet Moylan who lost her husband and 10-year-old daughter to a freak drowning accident.<br />- Debbie Harding, a former cheerleader for the New England Patriots that survived breast cancer and her marriage to a drug addict.<br />- Peggy Stoks, who was molested by her grandfather.<br />- Mike and Kathie Clarey, parents whose 11-year-old daughter was murdered while on her newspaper route.<br />- Grace MacKinnon, who faced and overcame her congenital disability.<br />- Thomas Howard, a teacher and author that suffered from disabling migraines.<br />- Dr. Kim Hardey, who suffered the death of his 9-year-old son.<br />- Debbie, a mother that has suffered eight miscarriages.<br />- Joan Ulicny, whose life was dramatically altered by an accident with a semi-truck.<br />- Carl Cleveland, a New Orleans lawyer that faced 10 years in prison for unfounded legal charges.<br />Even more compelling than the stories, however, are how each individual responds to the cross that they were given. Their responses of healing and hope show how good can come of evil.<br />\\"Christ had to suffer and die,\\" says co-editor Jeff Cavins. \\"Salvation isn't just about Jesus' dying: otherwise he could have been sacrificed as a baby. Suffering - even Christ's own suffering - was part of the Father's plan, and we are called to cooperate with that plan.\\"<br />Most readers of the book will realize how good their lives currently are. Not only does the book offer insight into suffering, but it prepares readers for potential future suffering, and helps them to know how to respond to others that are suffering.<br />I wholeheartedly recommend this first book in the Amazing Grace series - a kind of Catholic \\"Chicken Soup for the Soul\\".

It follows the Albertian Order of Leibowitz - a future religious order of bookleggers and memorizers who have been entrusted with the safekeeping of history in their monastery.<br />Set 2000 years into the future, the book examines what remains after the human race virtually destroys itself through nuclear war, and the gradual rebuilding of society brought again to the brink of nuclear war in the far distant future.<br />The novel is both terrifying and fascinating. One comes away from the book recognizing the eternal nature of the Church, and the role of monastics to safeguard doctrine.	2002-06-03

Budziszewski addresses the three goods of marriage: procreative, unitive, and sacramental. The error of our time, Budziszewski writes, has been trying to tear the three apart. \\"By saying `yes' to union but `no' to procreation, we still get a kind of union, but it goes bad; it ferments, turns sour, and begins to stink,\\" writes Budziszewski.<br />With the problem thus stated, the purpose of the book then is to put the 3 back together. The authors do so both successfully and efficiently. Open Embrace, although small, is filled with great wisdom.<br />Catholics practicing Natural Family Planning will find nothing new here, but then that is not the book's intended audience. Rather, the Torodes have written a book for other couples like themselves - Protestant couples that were never taught to oppose contraception.<br />Like Kimberly Hahn, and others who have traveled the same road before them, Sam explains that he originally, incorrectly assumed that the Catholic Church's prohibition on contraception was a superstition, leftover from the Middle Ages. After a friend explained that the Church actually had reasons for its teaching, he decided to research the subject himself. The book is the result.<br />Beginning with what it means to be created in the image of God, the Torodes reason that our sexuality reflects God's likeness. It is from this \\"theology of the body\\" then, that the Torodes logically embrace a vision of married love and the one-flesh union which cannot be diminished or compromised through the action of contraception.<br />Their logic is clear, simple, and easy to follow. Desiring to conform their desires and actions to the natural rhythms of the woman's body, they lead the reader to Natural Family Planning. There, they encounter a profound, biblical perspective on the meaning of sex - namely, that love cannot be contained in just two bodies. Marital union reflects the Trinity.<br />A minor weakness of the book is that it makes no attempt to examine contraception from a moral standpoint. Rather than suggesting that contraception is evil or sinful, the Torodes are content to say that it is not \\"ideal.\\" Again, one must remember their audience.<br />At one point, the authors quote Toni  Weschler, who does not discourage couples from using condoms during their fertile time.  Any Natural Family Planning instructor, however, can explain that in addition to the high failure rate of condoms, the use of condoms will negatively impact a couple's ability to recognize signs of fertility.<br />While they do not address the moral theology, the authors do present a convincing argument against the many defenses of contraception by Christian authors (Dobson, LaHaye, etc.) that say that contraception can be used for good or ill depending upon one's intention.<br />The book stands as a challenging critique to a culture where the contraceptive mentality treats fertility as a sickness and children as inconveniences. The Torodes lay to rest the long-held myth that all NFP is the Rhythm Method  and also address the many marital and child-spacing benefits of modern, scientific NFP. Finally, they demonstrate how the contraceptive mentality leads to abortion-on-demand.<br />In the book's final section, Bethany writes a touching affirmation of what it means to be a mother. Her chapter, Be Not Afraid, reflecting both Scripture and the favorite words of Pope John Paul II, will warm the heart of any mother.<br />The book's great strength is that it wraps a very Catholic message with Protestant gift wrap. Many Protestants refuse to hear the Catholic perspective on contraception simply because it is the \\"Catholic perspective.\\" The Torodes, however, quote from a variety of Catholics - Mother Teresa, various Popes, G.K. Chesterton, Fulton Sheen, and others. For example, in the book's second section, Sam provides a historical perspective on contraception. He effectively usesthe early Church Fathers to demonstrate the Church's condemnation of contraception and abortion from its very beginnings.<br />I heartily recommend the book not only for Protestants, but also for the 95% of Catholics that ignore the Church's teaching on contraception. It would make a wonderful engagement or wedding gift for young couples.es the early Church Fathers to demonstrate the Church's condemnation of contraception and abortion from its very beginnings.<br />I heartily recommend the book not only for Protestants, but also for the 95% of Catholics that ignore the Church's teaching on contraception.

Memoir writers Russell Baker, Annie Dillard, Alfred Kazin, Toni Morrison, and Lewis Thomas share their thoughts on writing memoir. The chapters are taken from a series of talks given on the subject.<br />The authors point out that memoir is not biography.  The hardest thing about writing memoir, they agree, is not deciding what to put in, but what to leave out.<br />They point to Emerson, Thoreau, Twain, and each other as models of good memoir writers.<br />Annie Dillard says that she writes memoir to fashion a text.  She advises that those who want to preserve memories will avoid writing memoir since the act of writing an event often takes more time than the event itself.  She compares writing to taking care of a baby. &quot;You don't take care of a baby out of will-power, you do it out of love,&quot; she says.  It's the same, she says, with writing.	2002-06-01

The organization's leader, Mitch Snyder, claimed that sometimes it was the only way to get people to think.<br />With a new Republican president, I fully expect the &quot;left&quot; to again shine a spotlight on the alleged problem of &quot;homelessness&quot; as a way of tarnishing the Republicans, despite the fact that the Republicans are seriously trying to address social issues through their Faith-Based Initiatives.	2002-06-01

Chodorow presents three common approaches to explain why women mother.  In the end, she emerges, not surprisingly, favoring only one.<br />Chodorow's first explanation is that mothering is a product of biology. Chodorow attacts this theory stating that genetic or sexual differences do not make a woman a better mother and that women do not have a motherly instinct any more than a father. Her argument is seriously found wanting.<br />The second approach that Chodorow dismisses is the socio-anthropological view that mothering is a product of role-training. This view states that girls learn socially the role that they are to assume - that of mother.  Chodorow disagrees that girls simply acquire this role in such an observant fashion.<br />Chodorow believes that men and women can parent equally, but she feels that the differing relational needs developed in childhood are reproducing women as mothers in adulthood.<br />Unfortunately, Chodorow completely dismisses the fact that men and women are different. Therefore, her theory is seriously flawed.	2002-06-01

While some readers may disagree with Rose's research methodology, his lack of balance, and some of the conclusions he reaches, they cannot argue with the book's overall thesis - that a great many potentially good priests have been turned away from U.S. seminaries over the past two decades.<br />Rose interviewed more than 125 individuals and sifted through many, many stories in order to put this book together.  In the end, the book demonstrates how seminaries have used psychological testing, harassment, poor teaching, peer pressure, and other techniques to prevent good candidates from attending or remaining at some seminaries, and how similar tactics have been used to prevent \\"good\\" men from being ordained.<br />The book highlights individual examples from a variety of seminaries (Boston's St. John's Seminary, New Orleans' Notre Dame Seminary, Oregon's Mount Angel, Chicago's Mundelien, Belgium's Louvain and others) to prove his points.  Sometimes it works; at other times it does not.<br />The end of the book is rather encouraging. It highlights the current situation among seminaries, especially those that are receiving many vocations. It also addresses the role of the priest from Pope John Paul II's perspective. The uplifting tone at the end makes up for the disturbing stories that make up the beginning of the book.<br />Rose also makes it clear that homosexual behavior has been rampant, and largely ignored, on some seminary campuses. While his purpose is not to address the clergy sexual abuse scandal currently rocking the Church, the astute reader will wonder whether such behavior has contributed to the problem the Church is currently facing. Many observers tend to think that the two are related.<br />Whether you agree or disagree with Rose's conclusions, the book is well worth reading.  It provides a real eye-opener into the seminary problems of the past 20 years and also examines why the problems, in some cases, have not been addressed.<br />Hopefully, the U.S. Bishops will take Rose's information into consideration when they meet in Dallas. The author makes points that are well worth investigating.<br />If even a small percentage of what Rose documents is true, it's very likely that the worst, in the media's coverage of priestly sexual abuse, is still yet to come.20 years and also examines why the problems, in some cases, have not been addressed.  <br />Hopefully, the U.S. Bishops will take Rose's information into consideration when they meet in Dallas.

Tears the lid off the current seminary scandal.	Michael Rose could not have put together a more timely book. Goodbye! Good Men exposes the degradation and immorality found at several Catholic seminaries and through first-person accounts explain how faithful priestly candidates over the past two decades have been turned away.<br />Rose, familiar to most through his work profiling the \\"wreckovations\\" performed in Catholic cathedrals and parishes in his books, The Renovation Manipulation and Ugly as Sin, does a bang-up job profiling the depths of sexual perversion rampant in major U.S. seminaries.  The book is not for the faint of heart.<br />The book goes a long way in explaining the recent sexual scandals plaguing the Church. Those shocked by the scandals, will be even more shocked when they read the book.  If even a portion of what Rose documents is true, the worst is yet to come.	2002-04-25

Then pick up this treasure.  Featuring more than 8,000 girls and boys names, the advantage to this resource is that it lists appropriate patron saints for most of the names, along with a very brief biography of such saints, the meaning of the name and includes the feast day for the patron.<br />For parents desiring to find Christian names for their children, this is an indispensible resource.<br />In addition to common Germanic, English, French, and Irish/Gaelic names, the book also features many African-American, Native American, and Arabic names as well.<br />You'll find such common names as Thomas, Anne, Susan, and David, as well as less common names such as Marva, Montana, LaShawna, and Moesha.<br />Where there is no appropriate patron saint for a given name, the book will examine the history of a name, break it down into parts, or find a patron that relates to the name's meaning so that very few names do not have a patron associated with them.<br />I recommend this book for any parent deciding on names for their children.	2002-03-26

I'm not one to normally read the books that everyone else is reading, but I did break down to read Mitch Albom's story of his final class with his former college professor Morrie Schwartz.<br />Albom is an excellent writer.  He draws the reader in quickly and tells a wonderful tale.  I was able to finish the book in a single evening.<br />The story, as most know, follows self-absorbed Albom as he spends Tuesdays with his dying professor.  In the process, Albom learns a thing or two about death, and about life.  The consummate journalist, he brings Morrie questions about death, marriage, family, forgiveness, regret, and culture.<br />The books is a beautiful study in dying and should be required reading for sociology courses.  Not only did the book help me think about my priorities, but it was also entertaining, providing several out-loud laughs, and moments of tears.<br />While it's a bit shallow on the spiritual side of things, I still highly recommend it.	2002-02-23

Like the first, it introduces the reader to many largely unknown saints through both words and numerous photographs.<br />A respected hagiographer, Ball has assembled a unparalleled collection of modern blesseds, venerables, and saints.<br />This work, like her first, is thoroughly inspiring.

While such speculation is premature, the reasoning makes sense.  This continent of 117 million Catholics has already produced three popes, three Doctors of the Church, eight Fathers of the Church, and thousands of martyrs and saints.<br />I recall some time back a colleague asking for a book like this. Unfortunately, at that time, I was unable to direct him towards anything that I was familiar with.  As I said, this book is long overdue.<br />Fr. O'Malley has done a great service in compiling this book of some ninety African saints.  To my knowledge, it is one of few books like it. The saints' stories are told simply, yet inspiringly, shedding much needed light on these saints forgotten by the West.<br />The entries include such familiar names as St. Augustine and St. Monica as well as many, many less known saints such as Blessed Josephine Bakhita, St. Deogratias, St. Melchiades, and Blessed Isidore Bakanja.<br />The book is organized in a curious fashion - listing the saints according to their feast days rather than alphabetically.  Thankfully, an index in the front of the book also lists them in a calendar format so that the reader can more easily look up particular saints.  An alphabetical listing of all of the saints, or a similar index in the back of the book, might have made it easier to find a particular saint.<br />Each chapter covers the saints whose feast days fall within that month.  A convenient map in the beginning of each chapter indicates the region where each saint came from, although the map does not indicate specific countries.  Many of the saints come from regions before they were recognized African countries.<br />Also helpful is the brief history of the Catholic Church in Africa found in the back of the book and a glossary.<br />Again, this book is a welcome addition to hagiography.  Those interested in the saints, or those interested in Africa, will find this book enormously interesting.ly interesting.	2002-01-16

It contains more than 100 new words and also allows the lector to look up confusing words in one of two ways. Lectors can either look a word up in the alphabetical listing of words at the end of the book, or they can look up difficult words based upon the readings in a particular year and season.

This is a &quot;POCKET&quot; catechism.  It comes in a pocket size and has brief &quot;pocket sized&quot; explanations of the faith.<br />The first half of the book contains commonly asked questions about God, faith, and the Church along with brief answers.<br />For example, Question 3 reads, &quot;Why did God make you?&quot; along with the response: God made you to know Him, to love Him, and to serve Him here on earth, so that I may live with Him forever in Heaven.  Each question also lists the corresponding grade level for which that particular teaching is most appropriate.<br />The catechism also includes commonly asked questions about the Rosary, the saints, the Sacraments, and the Commandments.<br />The latter half of the book includes about 20 popular prayers, how to pray the Mass, how to make a good confession, the rite of reconciliation, and a Church calender including Holy Days and major Saints' feast days.<br />It's clear that the pocket catechism is not the end-all and be-all. It is meant only as an entry point into the faith.<br />I can imagine faithful young people carrying this with them as a guide or even as an introduction to the Church for the un-Churched.

Chesterton &quot;Father Brown&quot; story, several priests, and the dead body of a young faculty member up for tenure and you have the ingredients for McInerny's entertaining mystery.<br />At times the book is a bit hard to follow.  Set exclusively at the University of Notre Dame, the book is so detailed in this regard that anyone unfamiliar with the campus may feel like an outsider reading the book.  The book is formulaic, a bit predictable, and McInerny has the habit of assuming that his readers are schooled in foreign languages as he frequently tosses in Latin and French expressions that the lay reader may find frustrating.<br />However,the book offers an insightful and witty look at tenure and the politics of a university campus, and takes some shots at the &quot;political correctness&quot; found on campuses.  The author of more than 20 books, including the Father Dowling mysteries, McInerny does know how to tell a tale.<br />Those familiar with the University of Notre Dame, fans of McInerney's mysteries, or fans of G.K. Chesterton will find this mystery particularly enjoyable.	2001-07-30

At first he's difficult to understand, but for the reader that continues, eventually the light goes on and everything makes sense.<br />It's amazing that Chesterton was able to pack so much into so little of a book.  This brilliant introduction to Aquinas should be required reading on all college campuses.<br />Chesterton admits that the book is a biography.  His hope is that it will introduce readers to Aquinas' philosophy and therefore lead them into his theology.  The theology, Chesterton also admits, is the one thing that he has left out of the book.<br />Instead, Chesterton spends a great deal of time comparing Aquinas to St. Francis of Assisi - a comparison which at first might seem quite odd.  In classic Chesterton style, he demonstrates that the two friars were perhaps more similar than they were different.<br />Each generation, Chesterton writes, is converted by the saint who contradicts it most.  Therefore, argues Chesterton, the 20th century is clutching at Thomism because it has neglected reason.<br />&quot;...as the eighteenth century thought itself the age of reason, and the nineteenth century thought itself the age of common sense, the twentieth century cannot as yet even manage to think itself anything but the age of uncommon nonsense,&quot; writes G.K.<br />I was particularly intrigued by Chesterton's introduction of Martin Luther late in the book and his argument that the quarrel between the Augustinians and the Dominicans led, in part, to the Protestant Reformation.<br />The brilliance of this book is both its simplicity and the Chestertonian gems discovered within.  Modern readers, familiar with Pope John Paul II's &quot;Theology of the Body&quot;, will note the connections between Aquinas' Incarnational theology, Chesterton's common sense, and the work of John Paul II.	2001-07-25

We sit in the very back, so that the noise will not distract other parishioners and so that we can walk out if we need to.  Some mornings are far worse than others, but by and large, the more often we attend Mass the better the children seem to do during Mass.<br />&quot;Never apologize for bringing your children to Mass,&quot; writes author Kay Lynn Isca.  Can there be any more uplifting message than this to a parent of a toddler?<br />Isca has assembled a fantastic little booklet for anyone who has ever struggled with a toddler during Mass.  She offers advice on diaper changing, nursing in public, and appropriate Church toys.  She also tackles the question of how to block siblings who get too rambunctios during Mass. (We sit one child between each adult and hold the baby.)<br />I found much reaffirmation of what we were already doing (i.e. not bringing food, bringing toys just results in arguments over the toys, bringing religious books, etc.).<br />Ignore the angry stares of those folks in the pew next to you and get this book.  You'll find it most helpful in knowing how to handle your youngsters at Church.	2001-07-16

Lewis' common-sense approach, and easy-to-understand analogies catch the reader unawares.  One finds him or herself agreeing with Lewis, even when one is unsure what it is one has agreed to.<br />In Book 1 Lewis makes the case for morality, or what he terms &quot;the law of human nature&quot; written upon men's hearts.  In Book 2, he examines the competing conceptions of God and makes the case for Christ.  Here he states that all Christian denominations tend to hold 3 things in common - these being baptism, belief (faith), and Holy Communion.  In Book 3, he examines the Cardinal virtues, the theological virtues, and the importance of living virtuously.  And in Book 4 he leads the reader into the doctrine of the Trinity and what this means for the believer.<br />An Anglican himself, who avoided speaking of Catholicism, contrary to the direction many have taken this book, Lewis argues against a kind of non-denominationalism.  He says that if Christianity is viewed as a hallway inside of a mansion, his job is merely to bring us into the hallway.  Which room we enter, he says, is up to us, but he does argue that the worst room is still better than remaining in the hallway.<br />Readers desiring to learn more about what led to Lewis' conversion to Christianity should read G.K. Chesterton's &quot;The Everlasting Man,&quot; as Lewis has said that this book greatly influenced his belief in Christ.	2001-05-16

This is one of the most useful books to have crossed my desk in months.  Rev. Richard Hogan examines the heresies which have beset the Church from the Ascension to the present.<br />This book is a historical goldmine, shedding light on such heresies as Gnosticism, Arianism, Nestorianism, Luther and the Reformers, and even modern crisis in the Church.<br />A thorough reading of this book will show the reader that there really is no such thing as a new heresy.  There isn't a heresy that hasn't already been dealt with in the Church's 2,000-year history.<br />One comes away from this book with a deep appreciation for a Church that has withstood the tests of time.<br />I highly recommend this book for all students of the Church.

Using the Bible, the authors help those using this book to be able to explain and defend their faith.<br />The book answers the most common objections to the faith, including Mary, purgatory, the Eucharist, confession, and many other Catholic doctrines.<br />If we do not know our faith, how can we defend it?  This book is a great resource for helping people to know their faith and defend it.  It is the first book in a three-part series on Catholic apologetics.

Interested readers will discover Biblical citations on issues such as abortion, tithing, non-Catholic beliefs, drinking and other issues - giving it some merit even outside of Catholic circles.<br />While there are several books like this in existence, few have gathered so much good information all into one place.	2001-05-02

Look up &quot;Politics&quot; for example, and you will find 19 quotes from which to choose on the topic.<br />Under the heading of &quot;Abortion&quot; for example, Saint Basil the Great is quoted as saying, &quot;A woman who deliberately destroys a fetus is answerable for murder.  And any fine distinction between its being completely formed or unformed is not admissible among us.&quot;<br />One of my favorite sections, on the Eucharist, features nearly 30 inspiring quotes on the Source and Summit of the Catholic faith.  St. Francis of Assisi writes, &quot;All those are damned who see the Sacrament of the Body of Christ on the altar in the form of bread and wine by the words of our Lord in the hands of the priest, yet do not see or believe in spirit and in God that this is really the most holy Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;<br />No matter the topic, you'll find inspiring words from the saints in this wonderful collection.

The brief work is at once philosophical, logical, and semi-theological, even though Clive points out in his preface that he is no theologian (We can thank God for that!).<br />Lewis seeks to answer questions such as &quot;If God is good and all-powerful, why does he allow his creatures to suffer pain?&quot;<br />No stranger to pain himself, Lewis sheds some valuable light on the subject and on human nature. The book is both a comfort and a discomfort. One wonders how differently Lewis might have approached the subject after the death of his wife, for example.<br />I found the later chapters, particularly those on Hell, Animal Pain, and Heaven particularly enlightening.<br />&quot;Pain,&quot; writes Lewis in the end, &quot;offers an opportunity for heroism.&quot; His words ring true. Those who have suffered, to any degree, will find the book intriguing.<br />A fine work, I would not recommend that the Lewis neophyte begin with this work, but perhaps &quot;Mere Christianity.&quot;	2001-04-17

They have embraced the kind of Evangelical Protestantism Jeff Cavins describes in this book.  Their journey is as much the journey Jeff explains in his compelling story.<br />Cavins describes his early years of faith, how he fell in love with his wife, a Bible Christian, and his journey from Catholicism to Christian Bible College, to Evangelical preaching at an Open Door type of church, and then back to the Catholic faith.<br />Along the way, it's a roller coaster ride as we witness Cavins' own struggles with his faith, and then an eventual realization of Christ's truth.<br />I found his descriptions of always seeking to create a novel, livelier, music-filled Evangelical worship service lest he lose parishioners to another church as particularly interesting. Cavins' story is moving, personal, and at times humorous.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone that has a family member who has left the Catholic Church to embrace the rock-and-roll  service held in a high school gymnasium.	2001-04-17

For six years, my wife and I attempted to do the mixed marriage thing - sometimes attending her Church, other times attending mine, and sometimes attending both.  Our story is among the 15 told in Lynn Nordhagen's book.<br />Nordhagen's book is a twist on the popularity of current conversion story books.  It offers stories of pain and honesty from couples in mixed marriages between a Catholic and non-Catholic spouse.<br />Through the personal stories the book seeks answers to questions such as, &quot;how can you be obedient to God when obedience threatens your marriage vows?&quot; and &quot;Can you love God if it means hurting the one you love most on earth?&quot;<br />Each of the stories make the point that a spouse should not try to convert their mate.  Personally, had my wife ever suggested or pressured me to become Catholic I would have run in the opposite direction.<br />Catholic and non-Catholic spouses in mixed marriages will find much to identify with in this book. It is a much needed addition to the library of conversion story compilations.	2001-04-17

In spite of the title, this book isn't about what most people would think it's about.  It is not about abortion.<br />Rather, it is about what author Wesley J. Smith terms &quot;futile care theory&quot; - modern medicine's inaction due to the direction of bioethics and cost-benefit ratios.<br />Through compelling and often disturbing anecdotes Smith examines how &quot;bioethicists&quot; threaten patient welfare through redefinition, organ harvesting, and support for euthanasia.<br />Futile Care Theory, he explains, allows physicians to base care decisions upon the patients' &quot;quality of life&quot;, thereby often deciding that no care is the best care.<br />I found Chapter 6 especially interesting, as Smith discusses how our culture protects animals at the expense of people.  A similar action was taken by the National Socialist government in Germany just prior to the Nazi's creation of their &quot;Final Solution&quot; for the extermination of the disabled, gypsies, Jews, etc.<br />Smith includes an appendix which shows the payback in terms of medical discoveries and cures which have resulted from animal research.<br />In the end Smith advocates a &quot;human rights&quot; bioethics - one that will again value human life.<br />His work is eye-opening and demonstrates just how much we have embraced what Pope John Paul II has termed a &quot;Culture of Death.&quot;  I recommend this book quite highly.	2001-01-23

The thesis bears itself out as Mosher draws not only from China's history and actions, but even from its recent White Papers in which it outlines its strategic goals.  The Chinese elite are clear that the U.S. is a stumbling block to their own ambitions.<br />As Mosher explains, this also makes sense given China's history and name. China has always been the largest, most populous, most powerful country in the world in the eyes of the Chinese people.  Therefore, the last 100 years of weakness of foreign encroachment of China's invasion by Japan, for example, in the years leading up to WWII was a great blow to Chinese national unity and Chinese pride.<br />There can be only one hegemon - a single axis of power.  For most of China's long history, China has been the hegemon.  Mosher demonstrates that the Chinese elite seem determined to recover China's traditional place in the world, at its center.  That is what the very name of the country means.  Zhonghua, which is how you say China in Chinese, means the \\"Middle Kingdom.\\"  However, the Chinese elite have another way to refer to their country which is even more revealing.  They call it Tian-Xia, which means \\"All under Heaven.\\"<br />Mosher's book is eye opening.  Far from xenophobic fear or partisan politics the book examines human rights abuses in China, the prevailing myths which the U.S. holds about China, and suggests courses of action for U.S. policy towards a country which shares neither our values nor our institutions.<br />Mosher also explains the effect of the U.S. policy of engagement and the myth that rising market forces alone will transform China.<br />Rather than China becoming more like us, we are becoming more like them.  This is evidenced by the fact that the U.S. and China both have the most permissive abortion laws in the world, allowing abortion up until the birth of the baby.  Furthermore, with China's strict one-child laws, not only are the Chinese killing their own children, but with the export of RU-486 they are also killing our own.<br />Those who would summarily dismiss this book are perhaps like our own government that believes that China is a threat only if the U.S. government says it is.the baby.

For the Jubilee 2000, he chose Vietnamese Archbishop Francis Xavier Nguyen Van Thuan.<br />I originally read Archbishop Thuan's exercises by way of Zenit - the News of Rome.  As compelling as those accounts were, the book is even better.  Archbishop Van Thuan's experiences, as a prisoner in Communist prisons for 13 years, and his insight on faith are true food for a hungry soul.<br />Testimony of Hope is the complete text of those Exercises.  Archbishop Van Thuan's description of isolation and abandonment, and his secret for finding hope in despair makes for moving and uplifting reading.<br />I guarantee that readers will be moved by the 22 meditations.  Archbishop Van Thuan offers light amidst the darkness.  The book is a quick, easy, and inspirational read.	2000-11-22

By 1970, the medical community had recognized the fact that pregnancy helped lower the risk of breast cancer. A World Health Organization study of women from seven different countries, released at that time, found that women who carried pregnancies to term had lower risks of contracting the disease.<br />Joel Brind, Ph.D., professor of biology and endocrinology and founder of the Breast Cancer Prevention Institute, has led research on the abortion-breast cancer link. He has described abortion as the single most avoidable risk factor in breast cancer prevention. Not surprisingly, his early attempts to draw attention to the link were ignored. It was not until 1994, when the medical journals Lancet and the Journal of the National Cancer Institute published data confirming his research, that those outside the medical community took notice.<br />The Breast Cancer Prevention Institute has gathered the following data:<br />* 13 of 14 studies since 1957 show more breast cancer among American women who chose abortion (27 of 33 studies worldwide).<br />* The only study on American women that relied entirely on medical abortion records reported a 90 percent increased risk of breast cancer among women who had chosen abortion.<br />* Planned Parenthood's abortion experts admit that young women who terminate their first pregnancy are more likely to develop breast cancer than those who carry their first pregnancy to term.<br />* A woman who is pregnant when diagnosed with breast cancer, or who becomes pregnant after breast cancer, is much more likely to be cured if she delivers the baby rather than has an abortion.<br />* The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has acknowledged the validity of Brind's 1996 finding that women who abort their babies are at 30 percent greater risk of developing breast cancer.<br />Concerns about contraceptive hormones' link to breast cancer were first raised back in 1972, when a series of animal research studies demonstrated a connection.<br />After attending a 1993 conference, Chris Kahlenborn, M.D., picked up on Brind's research in an attempt to disprove the claim of a contraceptive-breast cancer link. Kahlenborn first discovered, five years into his study, that it was impossible to deny the link between abortion and breast cancer. He then found that women who had taken the oral contraceptive pill prior to the birth of their first child were at a nearly 40 percent increased risk of developing breast cancer. Those who had taken the pill for four or more years prior to the birth of their first child saw their risk increase to 72 percent. And when abortion was factored in, the risk was even greater. This, and much more, is discussed in Kahlenborn's thorough and exhaustive book.<br />Kahlenborn suggests that the risk is enhanced among women with higher-than-ordinary risk factors to begin with, such as those who are childless, African-American or who possess faulty protective genes such as BRCA-1 and BRCA-2.<br />The indictment is not reserved for oral contraceptives alone. A National Health Organization study shows that women who have been injected with the long-lasting Depo-Provera for at least two years before the age of 25 have a 190 percent or more increased risk of developing breast cancer.<br />To fully understand the medical link between hormonal contraceptive use and breast cancer one must first understand the function of breast tissue cells. The female breast requires a proper balance of the female sexual hormones estrogen and progesterone in order to develop normally. When exposed to synthetic hormones such as those found in oral contraceptives, or to a rapid fall in hormone levels brought on by an induced abortion, breast tissue cell division increases, placing women at a greater risk for developing breast cancer.<br />Dr. Kahlenborn explains that contraceptive hormones and normal pregnancy cause breast tissue cells to multiply rapidly, resulting in new immature breast cells. A complete pregnancy allows these cells to mature completely, whereas contraceptive hormones and abortion leave them immature and prone to cancerous mutation.<br />Not only have abortion and contraceptive use increased since their availability, but breast cancer rates have increased dramatically over the past four decades. Kahlenborn believes that at least 10,000 women die each year as a result of breast cancer caused by abortion, and thousands more die from breast cancer brought on by the use of oral contraceptives.<br />Nevertheless, a deafening silence continues among researchers, the medical community, the media, and government agencies.<br />If such a causal relationship were demonstrated between breast cancer and a dietary agent, action would be swift and severe. But because the apparent cause incriminates the abortion and contraceptive industry, the collective silence continues, along with the breast cancer deaths, which now number in excess of 43,000 annually.<br />How many more women need to die before all women are informed of such risks? If the pro-abortion forces are truly pro-woman, truly pro-choice, they will disclose - immediately - these risks, and thus give women the information they need to make informed choices. Failing to do so will almost certainly result in a class-action lawsuit that will make the tobacco industry settlement pale in comparison.e found in oral contraceptives, or to a rapid fall in hormone levels brought on by an induced abortion, breast tissue cell division increases, placing women at a greater risk for developing breast cancer.<br />Dr. Kahlenborn explains that contraceptive hormones and normal pregnancy cause breast tissue cells to multiply rapidly, resulting in new immature breast cells.

What can a man offer about a book for women?  Well, as a husband who does  his fair share of cleaning and dishes and child-rearing I can tell you that  not only has my wife benefitted from this book, but so have I.<br />I have  benefitted in that not only is my wife a more content mother because of the  advice offered, but I am a better father.<br />I'm better because she is more  content, and I am better because the book's advice and prayers are  beneficial to housewives and househusbands weary from the drudgery of daily  housework.<br />The author demonstrates that housework and childcare can be a  path to holiness.  Finding the spiritual and the sacredness in our everyday  tasks can make us Saints.<br />I highly recommend this book, for both  housewives and their husbands.  It is a short, easy read.  The very  practical and honest prayers at the end of the book are alone worth the  price of the book.	2000-08-23

Whereas the original featured 11 stories of primarily  Evangelical Protestants, the sequel (or equal perhaps) features 15 stories  from men and women of a variety of backgrounds: Mormon, Lutheran, pagan,  Protestant missionary...<br />While many of these stories have appeared in the  pages of Envoy Magazine, collectively they leave a lasting impact on the  reader.  Each story demonstrates how the Holy Spirit acts within individual  lives to move individuals towards Christ and His Church.<br />Each story  highlights various historical, biblical, personal, and emotional reasons  for the individual conversions.  Taken as a whole, the book confronts most  of the arguments that people have against the Catholic Church.<br />I'd  recommend this book to those who have misconceptions with the Church, those  unsure why they are Catholic, and those solid in their faith.  It is  reassuring, inspirational, informative, and uplifting.	2000-08-23

What a delightful, wonderful, interesting, thought-provoking, and inspiring book this one is.  Evangelical Biblical scholars have pondered the meaning of John's Book of Revelation for a long time.<br />For too many,  they read it as the &quot;end times.&quot; Dr. Hahn did the same thing, as  a Presbyterian minister.<br />It wasn't until he became Catholic that he began  to see Revelations as a blueprint for the Mass.  Hahn demonstrates how  Revelation gives us a glimpse of Heaven and of Mass.  The premise of the  book is that Mass itself is a little slice of Heaven on Earth.<br />What Hahn  offers is not something new.  This is what the Church has taught for  centuries.  Yet, Hahn presents it as only he can.<br />Hahn offers not only  a beautiful view of Revelation, but also of Mass.  It is a view that too  few Catholics take to heart.<br />Not only is this a simply delightful book,  but it's also a short book - one that could easily be read in one  sitting.<br />I highly recommend it.  Catholics will gain a new appreciation  for Mass and all that they have taken for granted.  Non-Catholics will  appreciate an alternative view of The Book of Revelation.	2000-07-05

Then, flipping to the index in the back you will find that you are able to look up dishes based upon their main ingredient (e.g. chicken, zucchini,  potatoes).<br />We use this cookbook far more than any other book in the  kitchen.  Of all the dishes we have made, I can only recall not liking  one.<br />It's naturally heavy on breakfast and brunch foods, but it has  something to satisfy anyone's tastes - desserts, main courses, appetizers,  beverages.<br />The biggest pain with this book is that it is separated by bed  and breakfast rather than by kind of dish.  This makes it rather time  consuming to find a recipe.  One has to turn to the index and then go down  through the list flipping to various pages to find the &quot;perfect&quot;  chicken dish, for example.<br />Separating the recipes out by type would have  saved the recipe searcher a fair amount of time.<br />Still, it's a wonderful  cookbook.  I'm glad we have a copy.  WARNING:  This cookbook contains  absolutely no photos of the food, so those who like seeing what the dish  will look like will not enjoy this book.	2000-05-02

Those  commitments include:  - Affirming Christ's Lordship Over Our  Families  - Following St. Joseph, the Loving Leader and  Head  of the Holy Family  - Loving Our Wives All Our Lives  - Turning Our  Heart Toward Our Children  - Educating Our Children in the Discipline  and Instruction of the Lord  - Protecting Our Families  -  Providing for Our Families  - Building Our Marriages and Families on  the  &quot;Rock&quot;<br />Wood effectively uses Scripture, secular  statistics, and papal encyclicals to provide practical things that fathers  can do to build solid marriages and secure families.

Faced with a  decision which means losing their job and a means of providing for their  family, the Coming Home Network offers valuable suggestions and linkages  that can help such individuals find employment.  The book also includes  some survey results from converts.<br />As an added bonus, the Appendix  features the popular Catholic Answers booklet, &quot;Pillar of Fire, Pillar  of Truth&quot; - a tract that has been helpful to hundreds of thousands in  explaining the misconceptions that so many have about Catholicism.	2000-05-02

He presents the typical Hollywood formula, 3-act  structure, length, and style.  If a screenplay writer doesn't keep his or  her screenplay to the expected formula and technical standards it will  never even get read.<br />Hunter also provides a screenplay of his own  complete with commentary so that readers can follow along with him.  It's  not a good screenplay, mind you, but it is helpful.<br />I'm not saying this  book is the best screenwriting book on the market, but it did offer helpful  information to someone who knows absolutely nothing about writing  screenplays.	2000-04-29

I'm surprised at how many times I have turned to the book  looking for a review only to come up empty handed.  There can be nothing  more disappointing.

Imagine a method of family planning that is natural, harmless, 99.9% effective, is beneficial to couple communication in a marriage, and in  keeping with one's relationship with God.  That's what the Billings Method  offers.<br />Aside from a course in the method, this is an excellent primer on  how the Method works. It is a method that will not harm a woman's future  fertility (as oral contraceptives do), and will help a woman determine when  she is fertile (great for couples having trouble conceiving).<br />It is a  method which works - we've used it 100% effectively to both postpone and  conceive. It has been the best thing we could have ever done for our  marriage, our relationship with one another, and our relationship with God.	2000-04-29

This book is the result of Hahn's own doctoral thesis.<br />Hahn cracks open  the Scriptures and explains them like few others can.  His Protestant  background makes him well suited to explaining the Biblical basis for  Catholicism.  This book looks at God's progressive covenants with his  people over time.<br />It is an insightful book, full of wit and wisdom.  It  is easy and enjoyable to read.

This  well-researched work demonstrates that in addition to the damage done to  our soul, there is a long-term social effect on American society.<br />This  book is NOT designed for theological debate.  It is an important work to be  read by people on both sides of the issue.  It confronts the cumulative  economic effects impacting society.<br />For example, could the labor  shortages nationwide be the result of the widespread availability of  abortion on demand?<br />The author uses charts and graphs to demonstrate,  for example, that using cumulative abortion figures the estimated total  federal tax revenues that would have been collected by those aborted in  1991 alone would have been more than $135,073,193,50.<br />The author also  examines abortion's costs in relation to Gross Domestic Product, Education,  Lower Birth Rates,Fertility,Adoption, and Population Growth.<br />Roberge  provides a sobering analysis of the social, economic, and demographic  effects of abortion on the country.  If abortion continues unabated the  long-range effects will clearly be seen in labor, social security,  industrial productivity, and eventually national security.	2000-04-28

I was Lutheran at the time,  but desiring more time in prayer I signed up for an hour each Sunday night  to spend in prayer.<br />Each week I would read a chapter in this  eye-opening book.  The book, coupled with who it was that I was kneeling  before in the Blessed Sacrament brought me to the Truth so beautifully  expressed in the Catholic faith.<br />Countless others have similar stories to  tell.

It is  confirmed by the logic, which to many seems startling, by which the Church  deduces that sin confessed and adquately repented is actually abolished;  and that the sinner does really begin again as if he had never  sinned.&quot;<br />And this beauty is found only on page 9. 540 delightful  pages follow.<br />Ignatius Press has done a wonderful deed in reprinting the  collected works of Chesterton.  This is Volume III, and it deals  exclusively with Chesterton's writings on Christ and His Church.<br />Like all  of Chesterton's work it is a delight to read.  In it he tries to answer an  unanswerable question - that of his conversion.<br />In the end, Chesterton is  left to say, &quot;I might treat the matter personally and describe my own  conversion; but I happen to have a strong feeling that this method makes  the business look much smaller than it really is.... I would say chiefly of  the Catholic Church that it is catholic.

Apparently there has been some concern over the  validity of some of the research.  However,  one cannot deny the effects of  DES and similar estrogen-like chemicals and synthetic hormones.<br />The great  irony of this book is that Vice President Al Gore, who is openly against  life, has written the introduction to a book concerned about life.	2000-04-13

Nathanson leads us through his  life in a Jewish home and the events which led to his work as an  abortionist and with NARAL.<br />His vocabulary can be a bit challenging at  times, but it is very much worth the effort.<br />Especially chilling are  Nathanson's predictions for the future.  He predicts that just as we now  have abortuaries one day we will have &quot;death with dignity  centers&quot; - legalized places where we can bring our elderly to have  them put to death.<br />The book brings the reader right up to his potential  conversion to Catholicism.

Historian Arthur Schlesinger once described anti-Catholicism as the last acceptable prejudice in America.  This book shows he was right.<br />Consider some of the evidence presented by a Center for Media and Public Affairs report.<br />- More than 90 percent of TV news reports were critical of the  Church.<br />- Nine out of ten media sources criticized the Church's  ecumenical efforts.<br />- Church teachings and practices received less  support now than in any previous decade.<br />This insightful books examines  the evidence.  Not surprisingly it finds a media which uses negative  generalizations, invented history, vicious stereotypes, shared prejudices,  and outright denigration of Catholic religious beliefs.<br />This excellent  resource includes a comprehensive analysis of media coverage of the  Catholic Church from 1963 to 1998.  It includes contributions from former  Our Sunday Visitor president Robert P. Lockwood, Catholic writer Lou  Baldwin, associate director of communications for he New York State  Catholic Conference Rick Hinshaw, veteran Washington correspondent Russell  Shaw, and Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights president William  Donohue.<br />The book also features a practical chapter outlining 12 ways  individuals can improve their relationships wit the secular media.<br />This  book should be required reading among the politically correct,  anti-prejudice and diversity training fare taught on our nation's college  campuses.	2000-04-11

The book, however, tells far more than his story.<br />It also tells the story of Catholicism in America and the  creation of the National Catholic Register (a paper that once had a  readership that numbered in the millions), and its growth under Monsignor  Matthew Smith.<br />Through Hallett's eyes we are able to see the positive and  negative changes that have taken place in the Church, especially since the  Second Vatican Council.<br />As a National Catholic Register journalist myself  I found this book extremely interesting.  It holds great appeal for any  Catholic journalist, and the average Catholic reader as well.  It's a  history worth reading.	2000-04-11

Featuring brief biographies of more than 200 saints this book adds little to what can be found in more reference worthy collections.<br />The  biographies use the word &quot;legend&quot; a little too freely without  backing up the reference with a resource.<br />The kindest thing I can say  about this collection is that some of the black and white art which graces  its pages are more inspirational than the hagiographies.	2000-04-11

Books	3	37	47	N	N	Angels 101	In light of the recent angel fad, the numerous angel books, and television shows and motion pictures about angels it can be hard to know what is really known about angels.<br />Peter Kreeft tries to shed some light on this subject with this book.

It provides the stories of 17 women who for various reasons left the faith of their youth only to later return to the Catholic Church.  Their stories are compelling, honest, and inspirational.<br />All of the women  featured in the book were born during or shortly after the Baby Boom era.  While the women themselves, and their stories, are quite diverse, they  share a common pattern - their disillusionment with the Church, a  replacement for the Church, and their eventual return to the  Church.<br />Leila Habra Miller describes her sadness at being robbed of her  faith. `How easily I could have lost it all!  How easily my friends and  contemporaries have lost or could lose a faith they have never really  understood.  Inoffensive, doctrine-free catechesis doesn't provide even a  minimal foundation of faith, and faith built on so flimsy a foundation  cannot withstand even the smallest challenge, (p. 263).' Miller writes. As  interesting as their reasons for leaving the Church are the personal  reasons for each of their returns.<br />The book is written as much for  faithful Catholics as it is for those who have fallen away.<br />Reading such  personal accounts, we are allowed to share in the pain and disillusionment  of these women and learn from their mistakes. In their stories we are  humbled and reminded of our own sinfulness.  Like the story of the prodigal  son, upon their return home, these women too, discover the loving embrace  of a forgiving Father.	2000-04-06
