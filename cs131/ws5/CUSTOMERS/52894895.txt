If you absolutely HAVE to read this cuz it's a John Grisham book, get it from the library....not worth buying it...while the premise is commendable, his one page in-depth article in a recent Newsweek was far more succinct...so he spent a couple of weeks playing &quot;street lawyer&quot; just so he could write a book... big deal...he shed a tear only once....yeah, crying cuz this one is not gonna make the big bucks like his others...             John, when you were doing a book tour a few years ago appearing at Book Passage here in Marin, you said that you would start &quot;real writing&quot; as you did in &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; once you fulfilled your contract.....and made some money so you could afford the latitude of &quot;real writing&quot;.....well, you've made a ton of $$$$$$$$$ by now, don't you think you can start writing again for readers and not for the movies????  I  liked all of your books but i realllly LOVED your very first one....characters in &quot;street lawyer&quot; were one dimensional, story was extremely weak.....there just wasn't any substance...this could've been a very powerful book given your &quot;research&quot; and subject matter but you cheated your readers in more ways than one....only 11 lines on each chapter page....verrrry slim pickings there....give it some more effort next time around....!!!!	1998-02-09
