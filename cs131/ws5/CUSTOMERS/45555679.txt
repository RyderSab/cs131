Yes, she is very opinionated about things--but then so is the Zimmerman crowd--in this book she delves a lot more into silhouettes and what is best for your figure type. If you ignored the knitting aspects, this could be used as an additional reference on pattern drafting. The color plates of the garments are pretty good, although all she gives you is yarn, pattern silhouette, type of collar, and stitches used. Not much to go on if you are used to detailed instructions! <br />This is not really a book for beginners--her writing style and the editing makes it difficult to understand sometimes (just like the Knitter's Handbook) However, because she shows in detail how to calculate ease allowances and so forth, it will be a valuable future reference, especially for those who make more fitted knitwear. <br />The empty graph paper sheets from 1.1 to 2.0 are a big bonus in this book as well, and even though we now have computer programs that will print custom graph paper, it is great for those of us who need to print out a sheet or two on the copy machine for travel. I wish this book were back in print as well!	2001-04-26

I was very disappointed to see how few of her ideas would translate elsewhere--usually this is not the case with her books. Good Things was a much better book.<br />I found only one or two ideas that really stood out from the rest--not worth the price of the book, especially if you get her magazine or mail order catalogue.

This is an excellent book also for those putting on charity bazaars as well.<br />My only quibble with the book is that the author does not come down strongly enough on the &quot;truth in advertising&quot; about what type of crafters a show accepts. It is unfair to a customer to pay an admission fee for shows which purport to be &quot;crafts handmade in the USA&quot; only to see imports and junk that is featured in every gift shop you walk into. <br />It is especially bad for the crafter/artist who winds up in a flea market next to framed prints and kitchen gadgets when they thought they were entering a &quot;fine art and craft&quot; show. Caputo says that she is not willing to use security to escort the offending merchants out, but she could at least advocate the use of some form requiring that monetary damages be paid (at the very least the crafter entry fee refunded to all of the other artists). I also don't see why you as producer can't have someone walk around observing what is for sale (taking pictures if necessary) as soon as booths open as is practical to catch this type of flagrant fraud. <br />Having said that, she does a good job going into how to minimize expenses, piggyback onto events, and making up welcome packages for the crafters. A valuable book.	2001-04-22

I have the older edition, and it is hardly offensive in its language. You want offensive, go to fat squad at boot camp. <br />As far as whether or not one should eat breakfast (or anything at any certain time), if you are hungry, eat, if not, DON'T. Too many people eat because they are consciously or unconsciously &quot;tanking up&quot; for some imagined famine--&quot;Oh no, I won't be able to eat until breaktime!&quot;--or because they are semi-conscious in front of the TV. <br />I only gave it 4 stars because the writing style is somewhat annoying--it reads like an infomercial, with a lot of yakking. That said, it is still a good book on walking and worth the money.	2001-04-10

Books	3	9	9	N	N	Some good ideas, no concrete how-tos	This book puts out some good concepts, and some that can actually make you money, but he really glosses over the difficulties of &quot;techniques&quot; such as incorporation (apparently to deliberately, though legally, protect your assets from lawsuits), dealing with employees (even good ones), finding a &quot;good&quot; (meaning: take care of it and don't bother me) property manager, etc. Also, real estate is not as easy to turn around and sell as he makes it. Further, incorporation does not necessarily make you lawsuit proof if you are essentially the only one in your company. And, stock always seems to be high when you DON'T need to sell it. After all, the point of making so much money is (hopefully) to spend some of it on yourself and others. <br />If he has his Rich Dad's attitude toward the value of employees (pay as little as you can get away with and treat them like dirt), I am surprised that anyone would work for him. He doesn't seem to realize that SOMEONE HAS TO DO THE WORK. Some people LIKE to tinker with cars, make handmade furniture, etc. Not everyone can or should be an investor.<br />He also, and this is important, TOTALLY IGNORES the issue of health care. What do the rich do? Pay through the corporation? In his case, he might have lifetime health insurance benefits through where he used to work. He and other get rich books never get around to this issue, which will affect us all sooner or later.<br />People like him just have a different &quot;job&quot;, which more often than not takes up more of his day than he wants to admit. It may or may not be the type of job that YOU want.  To me, truly &quot;wealthy&quot; means you have so much income that you don't have to even think about it (think trust fund babies jet-setting to the Alps whenever they want).	2001-03-14

If you are getting this to recapture your boot camp days you may be surprised--most people I talked to about this book do not remember much stretching in the old days, and situps are done a bit differently now--hopefully to avoid injury and get more of a workout. <br />A lot of the stretches look like what you would get on an Oxycise! tape. If you were to do the stretches on all three &quot;cards&quot; with the oxycise breathing (or body flex for that matter) you could get a similar workout. In this book, you don't hold stretches very long, so I wonder how much good they do.<br />As to the rest of the workout, well, most fitness instructors no longer do the &quot;donkey kicks&quot; exercise because it is easy to injure yourself. The &quot;dive bomber&quot; pushup could also easily cause injury if not done properly.<br />Buy this book for the stretching, but if you want an entertaining AND useful boot camp book, buy Boot Camp:Be All You Used to Be.	2001-03-09

And, contrary to what another reviewer said, in all cases he considers &quot;brisk walking&quot; to be part of a workout if that is all you can do.  Anyone who thinks walking can't be a good aerobic workout should try racewalking. Also, remember that every pound on the body is about 4 pounds of pressure on your knees, so running is not for everyone, especially if all you have to run on is concrete and you are overweight and/or have bad knees to start with.<br />Especially good are the pull-up modifications, and the imaging exercises concerning food and why you should work out so you don't end up in a nursing home.<br />Definitely buy this book!	2001-03-08

The author's product line is not cheap either, and many of the projects (especially the hobo bags) look like a lot of the cheap imports available today--why put all that money into something when you could buy a nearly identical item cheaper?<br />The clothing is nothing remarkable either, and definitely warm weather only. If you like to slice up strips of fabric with a Rotary Cutter and crochet/knit, you might be able to adapt the patterns for a &quot;country&quot; look.	2001-02-27

The technique section in the front has very terse, hard-to-understand directions and hardly any pictures.  The techniques are great, don't get me wrong, but please try your directions out on rank beginners before publishing.  For example the circular needle trick to avoid double points is hard enough to understand in the Knitter's Magazine article--if I hadn't seen it, I wouldn't learn it from this book.<br />As to the sweaters--they are definitely for places with REAL winters (very heavy), and are definitely for people who will do anything to avoid sewing seams (steeks and so forth). I don't understand the obsession with being seamless--it's not as though you're going to wear these inside out.<br />The Sun/Moon design is the nicest of the sweaters but would have a horrendous amount of twisting colors to avoid long floats. It would make a really nice pillow. I do agree that the vest patterns are the nicest, but even they would be improved by seams to help them hang straight. The socks were okay for those who like to knit socks (I don't), but it would have been nice to include some hats.<br />This book is for hardcore Elizabeth Zimmerman and Meg Swansen fans--everyone else look before you buy to make sure you can understand the writing style.	2001-02-24

There are projects that even children can knit, as well as challenges for the experienced knitter. This book was written as much to showcase the skill of the spinners as to show off the designs. <br />They are not &quot;primitive&quot; designs, as one reviewer called them, but rather on the classic/practical side. As in actually worn by people to keep warm--imagine that! Since most of them are in natural yarn colors for the most part, it is easy to see why someone who is used to the latest &quot;big bucks&quot; manmade yarns often featured in most of the magazines these days might not like them. <br />The book does offer guidance on substituting commercial yarns for these designs, so you can use whatever you like, and the designs will look quite differently. IMHO, the only difference between Vogue Knits and other patterns out there is the fact that it says Vogue, and that the yarns almost always cost a bundle.<br />This book is great for anyone who doesn't like knitting huge projects such as sweaters and afghans, which seem to take forever. Many of the projects in this book work up quickly and are quite portable, making them great for traveling or waiting. Buy it!	2001-02-23

What happened to the women in the military at the time of the takeover? Did they just give it up for the country? This book was written in '85 or so, according to my copy, and the US (the story is about the US in a possible future) has had women in the military for years. Did the author just ignore this? Please. Can you see any woman, civilian or military, going along with this nonsense? I can't.<br /> Also, this was a very primitive future society--they execute by hanging. How hard could it have been to hit someone over the head, steal clothes/weapons/trucks and just leave? The &quot;willing suspension of disbelief&quot; employed while reading fiction (this utterly fails as science fiction) is impossible with such a laughable storyline.<br />Women everywhere should be offended by this book, as they are here portrayed as being dumb as dirt, motivated only by clothes, cosmetics, and women's magazines. So dumb, in fact, that they deserve what happens to them in this story.<br />I am sorry to see all the reviews mentioning this as required reading--the sorry state of education the world over, I guess.<br />Also, if this is the best Canada can offer the world in terms of literature, I wouldn't brag about it.	2001-02-22

I liked this book, although I think is a tad overpriced for it's size--I don't like to see so much empty space in a book. It is a Taunton Press thing, I guess.    The instructions are very clear, and I thought the inside designs for the most part (the flower basket hat--yuck--but the flower embellishments would be nice alternatives to pompoms!) were nicer than the cover designs, unlike a previous reviewer. Depending on the yarn used, you could dress up or dress down the hats. <br />Epstein sprinkles a lot of tips throughout, some in ways that you don't even notice until you look and say &quot;yes, that really does work better that way&quot;. This is a good book.	2001-02-21

Reading it, I got the sense that this author was NOT someone who gets all the yarn she wants from doing work for the yarn companies, but instead has to actually BUY her yarn, like most of us. <br />The styles were basic, but nice, and were shown as completed garments in both yarn choices. Many pattern books show other colorways and yarns, but only as pattern swatches. It is a much cheaper book than &quot;Simply Beautiful Sweaters&quot; which was totally about $$$$$ yarn.<br /> It would have been nice to see more closeups of the yarns that were used, so it would be a little easier to substitute what you already have. I also thought her yarns, even her nicer ones,  did not look all that different in photos from some of the rock-bottom discount yarns available--the cover photo really suffered in this regard. Perhaps the next printing will have some of these issues addressed. It still is a pretty good book.	2001-02-20

I  found Childers' exercises to be hard on the back, and even the basic standing breath is not easy on the back. The face exercises are good, but again, watch your back. The breathing alone is probably a good warm-up before going on a walk. I am giving it only 3 stars because there is also a lot of &quot;fluff&quot; in the book, and no before/after pictures of Childers.<br /> I think the breathing works because it curbs the appetite for a while--I was never really hungry for about 3 hours after, and often wound up eating only 2 meals out of 3. I do think that if you are already in shape, this is not enough of a workout for you, but for the rest of the population, it's a good start.	2001-02-14

Her explanations are clearly written. Even if you don't lose weight, the breathing is very relaxing, and you can do the exercises while waiting, walking, etc.<br />Only problem I had is with the breathing/singing segment. Opera singers have great breath control, but the older they get, the bigger they get--hence &quot;It ain't over till the fat lady/dude sings&quot;. Leave that out of the next edition.	2001-02-14

It would be nice to see stitch details. The instructions are both in chart and written form for the most part, which is nice.

Also, there are only a few scarves that aren't too dressy to wear with jeans for a walk in the park, so you are going to be spending some $$$$ to make most of these designs.<br />I wanted to give this book three-and-a-half stars.

This is definitely a &quot;buy later&quot; book.<br />Also, be warned, this book is overpriced, as are the others she's written.

Also, there is an extremely good section on how to decide whether you should or shouldn't use a broker to sell your home, how to conduct a home tour, etc.<br />Best of all, not only are most of the suggestions at or under $100, even though the book is a bit old ('86), they are things that anyone can do--not major undertakings which require a contractor.There are black and white photos of before and after rooms, which really show how just a little money, spent wisely, can make a huge difference in how your home will look to a potential buyer. Using this book as a guide, any home can show (and sell!) like a model home.<br />I loaned my copy out once and never got it back. Luckily I was able to purchase a used paperback copy (for $2 more than the original price!!), but there is a reason why it is priced $$$ on ZShops.

It would be much harder to use this method out there, except in maybe a very hot market. You might be better off working out a lowered commission with your broker/agent if you bring a buyer in. Some agents will make sure you have the necessary forms for a couple hundred dollars, as long as they aren't actually &quot;doing&quot; the sale. Nolo Press also puts out many good books on buying/selling homes.  <br /> This is not to bash agents, I have used a couple of very good ones, but in the really hot markets, you don't need an agent, you just need to be honest in your disclosures.<br />He also doesn't seem to allow much time for people to walk through the house in relative peace and quiet, so you're kind of bidding blind, like at a government auction, whereas with an agent/lockbox, you can go back more than once to see the house before making an offer. This is not so much of a problem if you are looking for a house in the same general area as where you live, but if you are from out of town with limited time this puts a lot of pressure on you. This type of advertising is also obviously directed at your local newspaper population, so without an agent you might miss a buyer from out of the area. Also, how do you handle inspection contingencies, and so on?  What if a bidder brings a buyers' agent?

I was very disappointed when I wrote to the author/publisher to get a pattern for the hat that was shown with some aran sweaters. What do you mean there's no pattern available--get real. <br />This one is okay if you can get it used, but it is obviously (see the book title) a book written to sell yarn, not a great pattern book.	2001-02-04

Some of the outfits would look good in a Victoria Magazine spread.<br /> The instructions for the techniques are presented in an easy-to-understand way, and you never know what will come back in style these days. All of the projects are shown in color<br /> Those who like to do needlepoint and cross-stitch will find many charts, while the knitting and crochet designs are so-so, although there is a cute knitted miniature sweater pattern. Quilters might also find the stuffed flowers interesting.<br /> Buy more for the techniques, rather than the projects.	2001-02-03

Some machine knitting books have some great pattern ideas to adapt for hand-knitting. The Cartwright-Jones books are really good for this.<br />This book had one pattern that I could adapt, a wrap that would be nice with a weaving technique. Also, I liked the pages on pattern drafting and finishing details. The rest of the patterns are rather English--long sweaters, long skirts worn with dark tights, knitted skirt and sweater sets, etc.--and there really aren't that many of them.<br />A machine knitter would find this book useful for the techniques. A bonus is that there is a page with knitters' graph paper on it that you can copy for your own charts--hand or machine. The scale is small, so you might want to enlarge it, but that means you can put an entire sweater front chart on one page. Yay! Graph paper is really expensive and hard to find if you need it RIGHT NOW, so this is yet another reason to buy the book.	2001-02-03

I don't want to clog my drains with this stuff. You might want to start with about half of the essential oils too, just to be on the safe side. Always better to underscent rather than overscent. Also, the fresher the base bar (here is where homemade wins out), the easier it is to grate and remelt. <br />Again, the basket ideas are great, and if you could use this with the Complete Soapmaker by Norma Coney, you wouldn't do too badly.	2001-01-31

If you have this book and the original video, you don't need any of the others.<br />I will say this, however. I think the most effective exercise in the book is the one she does on the studio ladder. It is somewhat modified in the book (hang from a door?) and in SuperCallanetics by sitting on the floor and grabbing a barre or windowsill, but you actually get the most benefit from having that ladder to brace against, yet have the height to be able to exercise the muscles, and get those arms in shape.<br />I have no idea how much a studio ladder would cost, but I'll have to put it on my wish list *sigh*.	2001-01-31

Please! The clothes would look nice on some people, but not for most of us, and nowhere does the author address how you keep reversible blouses clean, since you can't very well put underarm shields in them.<br />You would be better off getting Sewing Express by Nancy Zieman, or buying some of Jasmine Hubble's books. <br />This book needs a deep discount, or be republished with instructions!	2001-01-31

Yes, it's nice that it's a hardback, but let's face it--these are very small books. $9 would have been about right for what you get.<br />Also, for the most part, these books all use very pricey yarn, which helps in making them look unique, but if you look closely, you might already have some designs similar to these at home already.<br />Just because it says &quot;Vogue&quot; doesn't make it worth the extra money, at least not to me.	2001-01-31

Callanetics is a great program, but the one-hour program is a bit much for one starting out.

You don't buy a cookbook without recipes. The point of having patterns/recipes is so that you can replicate something you like. It is not a crime, really, no matter what people who read the Zimmerman books might say.<br />Not everybody likes charts. I am sorry, but it's the truth. It would not kill these authors to write things out, at least ONCE and please do not whine that it would add to the cost of the book. It doesn't have to, and hey, we have computers now, it's not like you're scribing these books on parchment with a quill pen by candlelight.<br />There, now that that's out of my system, I would still say to buy the book (though it is somewhat overpriced considering you get such little guidance and that there really are only 9 hats with variations), but it is NOT for beginners, and NOT for those who have better things to do than figure out badly written charts/instructions, even if they DO know how.	2001-01-31

Lots of colorwork, so you can use up your stash.<br /> My only complaint is that there are no squares of the colors used near the patterns, so that it makes it difficult to match colors--you have to use the photos if you can't afford to buy the yarn used in the book, and yarn companies are always adding and dropping colors so color squares would help a great deal. <br />The sweaters have lots of colors in each row, so if you can knit backwards it is a big help. There are also designs for babies in here, as well as one mens' sweater. <br />This book needs to be in print again--even if you don't feel like doing an entire sweater, worked in worsted weight yarns you could make some nice pillows or afghan squares with these designs.	2001-01-30

Also see Better Basics for the Home.<br /> Also, this book seems to use more stuff (like actual herbs--I'm trying to clean, not clog my drain thank you) and even more essential oils than CHCP. It is a rather small book, also, and somewhat overpriced.<br />Finally, why do publishers put out recipe books of any kind that are not designed to lie flat when you use them?

Or maybe it's because shawls look good on relatively few of us? I don't know. <br />A couple of the designs--checkerboard lace (really nice as a scarf/muffler), and the graceful (if you could lose the fringe) looked pretty good, but most of the rest would be nicer and more practical as scarves. Actually, they should have expanded the patterns to include shruggies, which are making a comeback, and look really nice if made in some of the fancier yarns.<br />The patterns are really nice, and the two designs mentioned above are easy enough for anyone to do, but I just don't see people wearing shawls these days. Sweaters yes, shawls no. Go in with a friend on this one.	2001-01-30

The author is very upfront about how well her recipes stack up, compared with commercial products. I think you could probably use some of the other, cheaper essential oils that also have antibacterial properties rather than tea tree, which is a tad on the expensive side, but she does not seem to use an excessive amount in her products, compared to some other books I've seen.  This book is a lot more fun to read than Clean and Green, by Annie Berthold-Bond, concentrating on recipes for everyday cleaning, and is an excellent introduction to nontoxic cleaning. Simple enough for older kids to use, too. <br />I would have rated this 5 stars except that the book itself has one of those el cheapo glued bindings where the spine cracks after only a few readings. I thought it was only my copy, but have since noticed the same problem in other copies at the bookstores. Buy  the book by all means, but write out the recipes on index cards to refer back to so the book lasts a bit longer.<br />Also, the author supposedly has a website, but it's not up yet,and it's like she's disappeared from the face of the planet, to read other reviews on this site.. I would have liked to get the labels to put on the containers. I hope she comes out with another book.	2001-01-29

Not worth the price of the book.<br /> I also was not happy to see that many of the recipes featured sodium laurel sulfate, which is a common allergen (it is in most shampoos, for instance). It is in fact in so many things that people often don't know that it is the culprit when their skin itches. <br /> There are better books out there: Clean House, Clean Planet; and Better Basics for the Home, if you are interested in nontoxic cleaning, and neither of them call for Sodium Laurel Sulfate for any of their recipes.	2001-01-29

I feel that it is needlessly condescending. Unfortunately, I see the same term in some other knitting books, which to me does not help the rebirth of this craft one bit.

If you are thrifty, this is a useful book. I think many have dismissed this book because &quot;tightwad&quot; is a much more negative word than &quot;frugal&quot;, &quot;thrifty&quot;, or even &quot;cheapskate&quot;. It always conjures up for me the image of someone with a wad of used tissues in his pocket, but I digress. This is not the first book on frugal living ever written, but it is better than many books out now.<br />This book has many good ideas and is worth buying new, although I am a bit concerned about how long it will last because it seems to be printed on newsprint, which is odd for a book meant to be a reference work. Other reviewers have said to buy used, but good luck, it will be a while (although by this time you may be able to find used copies of the first three books), and in the meantime you could be saving money. Also good luck trying to get this at the library--there is often a long waiting list.<br />The only other problem is that the index is not as good as it could be, and you spend a lot of time trying to find which category a tip is listed under. It's all there, I think, but it takes forever to find it. Oh well, the book is plenty of fun to read through from cover to cover.	2001-01-29

If you and some soapmaking friends want to go in together on this book to share among you it would probably be worth it as an additional resource. She does have a good discussion of why you should label soaps when you make cosmetic-type claims, and whether it's worth it to be in business.   But--I can't see too many hobbyists trying out her ideas, because most of them would land you in the poorhouse pretty quickly, even if you're bulk-buying with friends. There are cheaper recipes in other books and on the internet. Also, I'm somewhat leery of claims concerning most of the expensive oils. I mean, we're talking about something (soap) that is washed down the drain, not worn like creams or perfumes. I'd rather save the expensive stuff for other cosmetics, so as to really get my money's worth.   The last complaint I have is that almost all of the measurements are in grams, and while it is probably more accurate, it is not practical for many of us to own two scales, which she recommends.   I will say that if you have to choose between this and her other book, choose this one, as the recipes are much more manageable for the home soapmaker, size-wise, than in the first book.	2001-01-28

It is much, much better than &quot;Clean and Green&quot; and covers all sorts of cleaning issues.   I rated this only 4 stars for a couple of reasons. In one place she says that she doesn't use borax in her body care recipes because some may be contaminated with arsenic where it is mined, but it (borax) is listed as an ingredient in her shaving cream recipes. Well? Where do you get pure borax if you can't use the laundry borax? Secondly, her suppliers list is not the greatest. Suppliers could and should have been listed at the end of each chapter as well. It is still a good reference book for any home library.	2001-01-28

She at least has an index to her recipes, some of which are not necessarily frugal, but are interesting nonetheless.  I get the impression that McBride has some kind of inferiority complex about frugality (you need to hide the fact when possible by being Martha Stewart) which obviously creates a conflict when you read her ideas, both in this book and in her previous one. Many of her &quot;frugal&quot; ideas still involve buying stuff, and part of being frugal is NOT buying so much stuff.  Overall, this book is interesting to read through, but not necessarily to buy unless you're a fan of hers--apparently she has a newsletter. I'd never even heard of her until her first book came out. If you want something really creative in terms of being frugal, The Tightwad Gazette is a much better book if you can get past the word &quot;Tightwad&quot;.	2001-01-26

This book has excellent suggestions for how to store your yarn stash and how to combine different weights and colors of yarns. Also there is a good section on creating your own patterns and why you do some types of shapings to make items fit better. The patterns themselves are pretty interesting and if you like vests (I don't) there are several. One complaint I have is that most of her designs have what look to be very pricey yarn in them--she can justify buying it because she's in the business. Most of us do not have those kinds of yarns, so be forewarned--your results WILL vary. Also, on the &quot;knitting as warp&quot; technique, it would have been extremely helpful to have a &quot;before weaving&quot; gauge as well as one to be measured after weaving in. Definitely worth buying, just for the topics covered, as it is a good price for a hardback.	2001-01-26
