There is no resolution at all... just alot of really juicy character development.  Thats really what this series is about, characters.  If you read this for plot, you are going to be disappointed.  Sure, it is unpredictable, but you won't be satisfied that loose ends are not tied up, good guys don't always win, etc.<br />Why say more?  Just go and buy this entire series... undeniably the best fantasy series I have ever read.  Lord of the Rings was great in it's day, but you can only read the same book so many times.  This is the next big fantasy series that defies and defines the genre!	2001-04-03

But sometimes you don't want to sit in front of a monitor for hours, reading skinny black text off a bright white screen.  Frankly, that sucks.<br />When you start to specialize in a technology like COM+, I think a set like this is essential.  In this case the set is very handy and even gives some nice overviews of COM+ in the Windows DNA world.  <br />With this book you get an MSDN Library snapshot DVD (from July 2000) and a $200 rebate on a MSDN Universal subscription.  Unfortunately that expired March 31 2001 :( so you should know that before buying this set.  Even so, I think this is a great set and it is not simply a &quot;function list&quot; like most sets but is actually a great learning tool.	2001-04-02

You wouldn't think of it by reading the title, but this book is actually quite crazy.  I suppose that is the best way to describe it.  I've never read a computer book like it.  It's both technical (on a system architecture level) and free form (stream of consciousness).  There are enough jokes here to make you laugh out loud, and enough bad jokes to make you laugh just the same.  And, you get a unique viewpoint on all things COM.  Roger Sessions says some on-the-money one-liners throughout the book, but you'll notice alot to disagree with.  For example I found his remark that &quot;no one has ever figured out how to make use of inheritance in OOP&quot; way out to lunch.  <br />I recommend this book as a refresher companion to all those dreary COM manuals out there.  It's also a great political primer.  You just know some Javabean fanatic is gonna annoy you someday with his rantings.  You'll know how to tell him off after you read this :)	2001-03-20

You might expect another roller-coaster ride, having read the outstanding first book &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;.  While I believe that novel has the edge on this one, this is still an excellent book.  <br />Where &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; is Star Wars, &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; is The Empire Strikes Back.  Sorta.  Thematically, you know?  :)  Its not as pure fun as the first one, but it's a deeper novel where not everything happens as you hope.  And of course, nothing ever happens as you expect it to (thank you george thank you).<br />The future of the series notwithstanding, this is hands down the best fantasy series I have ever read.  My suggestion: read one chapter at a time, so you can savor it...<br />PS. My favorite character is still Arya!	2001-03-20

Its not about server-side applications in general; rather, a specific implementation of them... a Microsoft Back-Office certified implentation to be precise.  The first half covers creating, installing, and administering a service.  The second half covers security. <br />That said, this is a good book if you are looking to make a service and are concerned about security.  If you don't know what a service is, then you probably don't need this book.  But I'll tell you what it is just in case :)  The book defines it as &quot;a normal Windows application containing additional infrastructure that enables it to receive special treatment by the operating system&quot;.  ie You can see it as a 'snap-in' under the &quot;Computer Management/Services and Applications/Services&quot; directory in MMC.  From there, you can start, stop, and administer your service.  In essence, you are creating a background process that has no GUI.  MMC takes care of that for you.<br />Using VC++ and named pipes, the authors give you plenty of examples of services and clients.  A perfect follow up to &quot;Applications for Windows 4th ed&quot;.  Recommended but for a limited audience.	2001-03-16

And I mean serious!  This is not a beginners book, for that I would recommend &quot;Inside COM+ Base Services&quot; by the same publisher.  This book is a little too biased towards MS development environments.  For example they compare VC++, VB, and VJ++ and casually mention there are &quot;other capable environments&quot;.  Hmm.  Then again, this is a Microsoft press book, and COM+ is a Microsoft technology, so its to be expected.  <br />This book picks up where introductory COM books left off.  The first chapter is about error handling in your COM+ objects - not a good place to start learning COM :)  <br />Particularly useful to me was the last third of the book, the design patterns.  Here, the authors give us a meaty example of a &quot;real world&quot; COM+ enterprise solution.  What other book gives you this?  Answer: none.  Get this book!	2001-03-15

I love Stephenson's writing style, and his witty observations on the world.  But I don't read stories for that.  I read them for an interesting plot and characters.  This book has characters, but no plot.  Can anyone even say what the point is, apart from a few drab men wandering about breaking codes in WWII while in the future another sets up a company laying pipelines?  Is that fun reading?  Whoever finds that enjoyable really needs to get out more, I think.  Either that or I'm just not wild and crazy enough for a book like this.<br />I read 500 pages in hopes that a plot would develop and I would be rewarded at the end.  Alas, I couldn't make it through and began reading a much better book (A Game of Thrones).  Computer geek or not, you need a lot of free time and patience to finish this sleeper.  If you don't have it, please don't bother with this one.	2001-02-12

After giving up on the so-called masterpiece series &quot;Wheel of Time&quot;, I searched for a different series.  This one was getting alot of praise from various places, so I bought the first book.  You know a series is good when you rush out to buy the second book before you even finish the first.  That happened with &quot;A Song of Fire and Ice&quot;, a real pleasure to read.<br />Every chapter moves the plot forward, so you are not wasting time reading anything in this book.  And very rarely is the plot predictable; it is believable and compelling.  Even chapters that I felt would be a waste of time to read (I grew suspicious every time a chapter on Daenerys came up), actually turn out to be very entertaining and well-written.<br />All the characters are well developed, but my favorite character is Arya.  :)  I highly recommend this book, don't hesitate to read it.  Drop that boring, derivative Jordan book right now and buy &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;.	2001-02-11

In River of Blue Fire, nothing happened.  The characters ran through world after world, aimlessly.  Nothing happened that was significant, plotwise.  Mountain of Black Glass, sadly, carries on with this tradition.  Except for the final fifty pages, nothing important happens whatsoever.  At the end of City of Golden Shadow, Williams left us with a group of characters searching for Paul Jonas.  It takes two books to simply unite them.  It takes Williams more than 1000 damn pages of self-indulgence to move the story along that one little itty bit.  <br />The story throughout both books is stuck in a loop, which is broken down as follows:<br />1) Paul Jonas moves to new world.  Mysterious woman visits him and says \\"This may be the last time I can visit you Paul, it is getting unbearably hard for me to visit you\\".  Paul meets character Y  who could help him, but Y doesn't feel like talking, or Paul gets chased out of world by same bad guys (Twins) before Y can talk.<br />2) Renie, !Xabbu, and friends move to new world.  Renie loses consciousness.  Explore new world and survive new environment.  Renie listens to !Xabbu tell long boring story.  Renie loses consciousness.  Encounter bad guys.  Renie loses consciousness.  Move to next world.<br />3) Martine gives tacky \\"progress report\\".  Nothing she says is of any interest or importance.<br />4) Dread gets mad, thinks about killing somone, and plans world domination.  Cops inch forward in their search for Dread.<br />5) Orlando is sick.  Feel great for a few hours and does herioc deed.  Falls sick again.<br />6) Go to 1.<br />This book is trudge, reading through the same damned story loop over and over.  But it's a bit worse than trudge, since at least in River of Blue Fire things were believable.  But now, one of the key bad guys (Dread) just happens to be born with a magical brain power that gives him the super ability to take over the most complicated computer networks in the world.  That's phoney enough, but the fact that Dread is sitting around through 1000 pages trying to take over the network without using his power until he decides suddenly at the end of the book to use it.  Williams never gives us a reason why Dread never used his power before.  The true reason Dread doesn't, is so that Williams can tell his boring story without Dread interrupting it.  Thereby giving him 2 novels for us to waste our money on waiting for some resolution, and giving him 2 novels worth of space so he can indulge himself in creating worlds based on his favorite stories.<br />City of Golden Shadow is close to a masterpiece.  The sad truth is, the next two books are pointless and can be summed up in a paragraph.  So feel free to skip Volumes 2 and 3 (but go to the store and quickly read the end of Volume 3).  Now that Williams actually had something happen at the very end of book 3, however ridiculous, it is probable that Volume 4 will be forced actually pick up the pace of the series.<br />There are a couple redeeming features of the book.  Some of the subplots are interesting: the Christabel/Sellars subplot, the Pirofsky subplot, and the Ramsey subplot.  But what about interesting main plots?  That's what is important, and thats what MoBG lacks.	2000-09-27

The first one was great, a quick, fastpaced story with surprises and  mystery throughout.  This one, the characters are travelling on pointless  'adventures' through world after boring world.  Zzzz.  So, I had to trudge  through this one.  <br />Barely anything important happens in this book,  plotwise.  If you don't have alot of time to waste reading detailed  histories of Tad's one-stop fantasy-worlds, then just skip to the third  book.  Seriously, read the little blurb on what happens, and you will be no  worse off.  <br />I found myself skimming through the pages to find something  interesting.  Not a good sign.

I must admit I found the second and  third books somewhat interesting, despite being completely predictable.   But man, lets have some action!  What fun is it to read about people  travelling all over some bland world, while not having a single interesting  conversation, and then having a quick battle at the end of the book?  Come  on, it got old in the second book, overdone in the third, and made me puke  in the fourth.  I'm not going to bother reading Jordans cut-and-paste plot  any longer.  Unless I need to fall asleep quickly, that is.  Fantasy must  be in a really pathetic state if this is the greatest series available  right now.  The writing is quite lame, the characters wooden, if it werent  for the complex political world this book would get 0 stars.  Oh wait, I  can only set it as low as one.

See, for unliterary types like me, any book more than 200 pages is a nightmare.  I've been forced lately to read these  blasted Wheel of Time novels.  Still struggling (i.e. sleeping) thru the  boring Shadow Rising.  My friend assured me Shadow Rising was the greatest  book ever written.  But I couldn't make it past the halfway point it was so  stupid.  I was about to give up reading these nonsense fantasyfiction  books.  My friend had also mentioned Otherland was a good book, and since I  thought &quot;What the hell, I'll blow some cash on it and give reading  fiction one last chance&quot;, I bought this book.  Well, within 4 days I  read it.  INCREDIBLE, let me tell you.  It's not perfect, but any book that  holds my attention that well deserves 5 stars!  Well written and  imaginative, unlike Jordans  im-the-best-writer-in-the-world-so-im-allowed-to-be-boring-bla-bla-bla  books, and still leaving me in suspense even after the book is done.  I  desperately want the second book but all the local bookstores are sold out  (?) so, amazon.com to the rescue!  ;)  One thing you may want to be warned  about: this book is so good, you *must* have the second one on hand after  you're finished the first.

In this, you care about the characters.  The bad guys are still a joke.  Jordan makes the Trollocs out to be tough fearsome monsters, yet not even a horde of them even come close  to harming our heroes.  The whole thing is mostly predicatable, but a few  things stand out.  The last quarter of the book is excellent and contains  many surprises, with the Seanchan's damanes, Ingtar, and the battle.  The  funny thing about this book is that is basically another fantasy chase  across a &quot;fantastic&quot; land.  In the first book the good guys get  chased by the bad guys.  In the second book, the good guys chase the bad  guys.  In the third book, which I just stared, it seems now the good guys  are chasing each other.  Will the series stop with the chases already?  I  really hope so... but despite all that I did enjoy the book, even if I had  to suffer through the middle of it.

Well, I know everyone is fanatical and such about The Wheel of Time, but I just don't see what the big deal is.  It's the same as any other fantasy  book I've read.  The world is really interesting and well thought out, but  the characters are absolutely annoying.  Not one of the three main  characters takes initiative in anything.  They sit around complaining about  everyone else (not out loud, but in their head), and every decision they  make is stupid.  They show no emotion except &quot;I don't trust the Aes  Sedai&quot; even though the Aes Sedai help them out endlessly, or &quot;I  am scared of the bad guys&quot;.  These guys are supposed to save the  world?  And every time the characters talk, it is rarely about anything  except to tell facts that move the story along.  There are no casual  conversations that develop the characters.  I wonder how any of the other  characters know anything about each other, since they hardly talk.  The  other thing I found funny was Lan.  He is my favorite character in this  book, along with Moiraine and Nynaeve, since they are the only ones who  take initiative.  What was funny about Lan was that he was supposed to show  no emotion, but whenever he says something, he says it &quot;as though he  was very sad, but you couldn't tell because his face was as hard as a  rock&quot;.  That gets old.  Just tell us he is sad, or angry, or whatever.   I will continue reading the series though, as my friend promises it gets  better, so I have already started The Great Hunt, and it does get a little  better.  Stuff actually happens in that.  The Eye of the World is basically  a big chase scene, and every bit of it is predictable and derivative.  Read  it if you have nothing else to do.  Just don't expect a masterpiece, as  everyone calls it.	2000-05-25

Answer: not useful at all.  If Sid wants us to learn, he has to show us flawed scripts, then what happens when he fixes  them.  I personally found this book full of lame advice, describing  problems only complete fools would run into.  Maybe that is the point.  The  two things I salvaged from this book are: a) Do an outline of your  screenplay first, then write around that.  NEVER start writing from  scratch, no matter how bold an approach it seems.  b) Put lots of action in  your screenplay, avoid dialogue driven plays.  Think Dogma.  Apart from  that, I liked how Sid harped on cruddy movies like Die Hard 3 and Broken  Arrow... but he never shows us how or where they break down... he only says  that they do.

This is a must read story for anyone interested in filmmaking.  However, some words of warning.  Don't be fooled for a second into thinking you could do what Rodriguez did - very few people have access to all resources  he did.  He didn't have to buy or rent a camera!  If you alrady had all  those resources, you'd be able to make a movie cheap too.  Also, this is a  sad tale of how Hollywood will make any Joe Blow into a big shot director.   I don't think it's stretching things to say Rodriguez did not live up to  his reputation after El Mariachi... I mean, look at all the garbage he's  made.  Rodriguez went from hotshot to hack.  He should probably be a  producer, since he seems more concerned about how to cut costs than making  his characters interesting.  Those are my gripes, but not with the book.

Basically you will be exposed to Bible contradictions by being shown contradictory views of the Bible in different chapters, and the authors  remaining silent that the views oppose each other.  Then, you get the  historical basis for the Catholic Church and Christians in general for  committing morally outrageous acts justified by the Bible.  If you found  this book interesting, you should look towards The Encyclopedia of Biblical  Errancy, and even Ken's Guide to the Bible for more.  If you already have  either of those books you won't need this one, as it is fairly short and  leaves out alot.	2000-02-09

This book not only fails to teach you STL, but it is not useful as a reference either.  Let's say, for example, you want to learn how to use the STL priority queue.  Good luck with this book.   You are better off reading the STL header files.  Please, save your money,  whoever wrote this book must have taken some technical documents and  randomly pasted them together.  Ugh.

I was not disappointed!  This one makes you sad at times, angry at others (over the travesty that is the American Justice system).  If you are interested in  the case of Rubin Carter, or even about the mistreatment of blacks in the  US, this is worth your time and money.	2000-02-06

While I do not agree with this book's arguments or conclusions (or its &quot;atheist&quot; main character who believes in God) this is a really good book. <br /> It is very short, and sums up the reasoning and thinking of most devout Christians.  You won't find technical or philosophical arguments here.  But if you read this and have had experience debating Christians, you will have deja vu! <br /> This book was essential for me in understanding the Christian psyche.  Recommended.	1998-02-11

This book is just shocking, disgusting, and really makes you want to puke at all the atrocities done in the name of 'righteous' religion. <BR><BR> This is definitely a must read book, but it has problems.  It is not very detailed and more sources would help.  There is no index, and the title is inappropriate.  This only covers the years 1990-1994 in depth. <BR><BR> Thank you, James Haught, for having the courage to write this book.  I hope another comes out for the years 1995-2000!	1997-12-24

This book is richly illustrated and puts the life and times of great scientists into historical perspective and context.  It is an enjoyable read for anyone interested in learning about the major scientific figures of our history. <BR><BR> However, the author seems to push, very subtley I might add, for Christianity.  In one instance he says that the existence of God has been proven (150).  On numerous pages he makes errant claims, such as the one that Christianity has been science-friendly thoughout history (163).  It seems that the author has some conflict between his faith and his science and takes it out on his readers.  I don't think this is wrong, but it would be better left out of encyclopedic material. <BR><BR> Don't let that turn you off: the pro-religious propaganda is in very small amounts.  Aside from that, this book is superb and should make a welcome addition to your bookshelf!	1997-12-15

There is nothing here except big words, insults, and arguments from authority.  I don't believe there is a single instance where Ravi Zacharas uses logic or reason to prove any of his points.  Atheism leads to immorality - why? - because some guy in a Nazi death chamber said that the gaurds didn't believe in god.  Evolution isn't true - why? - because Phillip Johnson said so.  And so on. <BR><BR> Zacharias needs to read some books on atheism if he wishes to attack it.  For one thing, *he doesn't even know what atheism is!!!*  He defines atheism as the &quot;dogmatic denial of God&quot; because Paul Edwards and others said so.  Of course, he gets absolutely nowhere attacking his straw-man fantasy version of atheism. <BR><BR> This book will work only for Christians, because Zacharias goes on and on about how God wants this and it would be great to believe in his God.  Things that only a Christian would agree with, without any forethought or proof.	1997-10-28

I must say, in spite of the high accolades heaped upon this book, I must dissent and only give it points for it's brave attempt (?) at introducing freethought to a younger audience. <BR><BR> The problem is, Michael Martin expects his 'younger audience' to have an older reading ability.  My girlfriend, who is 16, was frustrated with this book not only because of the huge unexplained words (what teen knows what 'epistemological' means???) but because of the overly dry tone and total boredom of many chapters.  One of the beginning chapters, 'Letters from Lois', may be touching, but it is hardly something that will capture the attention of the average teenager.  Even I was wondering what the point was.  Much of the book assumed that the reader was fluent in the freethought literature, so it is not even useful as an introduction to it. <BR><BR> But maybe I am wrong.  Maybe Michael Martin does not intend this book for a young unenlightened audience.  In this case I have been highly misled by the reviewers and champions of the book.  Don't buy it for your kids unless you want to turn them away from freethought.  Read it for your own pleasure only.	1997-10-04

This book has a high price tag, but it is packed with information on the Bible.  There are more than enough contradictions, false prophecies, and errors shown here to prove beyond a doubt the errancy of the 'Word of God'.   <BR><BR> Essential debating and reference material (especially the handy index of Bible quotes at the back) for non-Christians.  It even has a section on the Book of Mormon and the Koran (although Ibn Warraq's book 'Why I am Not a Muslim' covers more).  If you have a Bible, you need the 'Encyclopedia of Biblical Errancy'!	1997-10-04

Smith's book, 'Atheism: The Case Against God,' this book doesn't live up to it's predecessor especially at such a high price. <BR><BR> Most of the essays are excellent: 'My Path to Atheism,' 'Philosophies of Toleration,' 'The Righteous Persecution of Drug Consumers,' and 'Children's Rights in Political Philosophy' are a great read and the last one really made me think. <BR><BR> However, there are some questionable essays; one wonders what interest anyone would have in reading 'Frantz Fanon and Jonh Locke at Stanford'.  One thing I found annoying were constant spelling errors scattered throughout - was this book edited?  Another thing I could not figure out was whether Smith was a libertarian or an anarchist - he certainly has no problem with the privitization of the justice system, yet on the back of his first book he is described as an advocate of the libertarian view. <BR><BR> If you have some extra cash to spend and want to add this to your collection, get it!  If you haven't already bought 'Atheism: The Case Against God' or 'Atheism: A Philosophical Justification' buy those instead.	1997-10-04

Is literary quality worse than 'The Celestine Prophecy' possible?  This book answers this question with an resounding yes!!  'A Divine Revelation of Hell' is so unoriginal and repetitive it forces one to wonder if the author used cut and paste to write the entire book from previous sections.   <BR><BR> On and on, we're taken on a bland tour of 'hell', a place where God sends people who don't worship Him, to be tortured for eternity.  There is no chance of parole, no chance of escape.  No matter how victimless your crime, no matter how long you are tortured, beaten, burned, and sorry for your sins you will not be let out.  The author, Mary Baxter, claims to have gone to hell with 'Jesus'.  As they pass by some of the souls in hell, they plead with Jesus to let them out.  They repent of their 'sins', and regret not worshipping God before they died.  Jesus gets mad at these people and yells at them, telling them he will *never* let them out and that they deserve to be tortured.  I thought the Christian Jesus was a man of love!  Apparently not!  <BR><BR>  Baxter's message is: If you don't worship this hideous God He will torture you.  So you better get down on your hands and knees and pray, unbeliever!  If you are a drinker, homosexual, adulterer, atheist, etc., you must change your ways or else Jesus will force you into hell forever.  Remember, Jesus is all-powerful and can let you out anytime he wants, but he won't, because he doesn't want to.  According to this book, anyways.  <BR><BR>  Mary Baxter even tells the reader, &quot;What you are about to read will frighten you.  I pray it will frighten you enough to make you a believer.&quot; (p174) The author's intent is to scare us all into becoming Christians, to use the threat of hell and the violence of torture to turn is into mindless slaves worshipping her god!  <BR><BR>  Well, as you can see this book is pretty insane.  Don't buy it unless you too are insane.  Then you might like it.  I wanted to rate it a 0 but the scale wasn't low enough.  <BR><BR>  As Charles Heston once said, &quot;This is madness!&quot;	1997-07-29

The author, James Redfield, writes as though he had just graduated from grade 2!  How many times does he have to use the word 'intense'?  Everyone looks at him 'intensely'.

This book is amazing in places, but in some it drags and bores the reader.  However, in places where it talks about evolution (eyes) it is amazing!  This chapter alone is worth reading.  Dawkins takes the simple concept of natural selection and shows how it so easily explains even the most difficult 'problems' of evolution.  Unfortunately, as in _The Blind Watchmaker_, I felt Dawkins couldn't quite communicate the differences between designed and apparently-designed objects.  A simple and brief distinction is made in _Darwin's Dangerous Idea_ by C. Dennett.  All in all, a good book	1997-06-21

The author tries the best he can to not tell the reader if he is serious or not in his novel.  However, I could not imagine anyone taking such a story seriously, so I assume the author is writing fiction.  In any case, _The Darwin Conspiracy_ is awful.  There are alot of smaller points I will not discuss here, but the fact that Phillip E. Johnson enjoyed this book pretty much sums up how bad it must be.  _The Darwin Conspiracy_ is the strange journey of Max Busby, a man who influenced Darwin to 'conspire against God'.  Busby warps the minds of everyone into believing that evolution is true when it is really just a hoax (or so says the story). Along the way Busby knocks heads with Hitler, Bertrand Russell, and some famous atheists... and acts as a catalyst to bring down God's kingdom.  Instead of arguing against Darwnian evolution, Bell seems to be maing an emotional plea to us all - that evolution is really the work of an evil power (Satan) and thus should not be followed - as if evolution is a planned conspiracy to take down the Christian kingdom.  Farfetched indeed, and frustrating, Bell's book will make you laugh - not with it, but at it.  Only worth reading for those deeply interested in the creation/evolution debate	1997-06-21

Do NOT read this book, even if to disprove it, it is simply not worth the effort.  This is such a waste of paper it is disgusting.  I tried to follow the physics but it seems that Tipler is just throwing formulas down for no other reason than to confuse the reader into agreeing with him.  (Oooh, look at these complex formulas, Tipler MUST be on to something here!) There are absurdities abound.  I do not know how the Times and other respectable book reviewers came to give this book such a high rating - no sane person who reads this book could come out with such glowing praise for stupidity.  His point on animals not getting into heaven (p249) is one that I will never forget, it is so mind-bogglingly ridiculous	1997-06-21

For anyone interested in the creation/evolution debate, this books pretty much sums up the best creationists can do against evolution.

Most of the issues he nitpicks are irrelevant, unresolved, or unimportant.  His argument is above average for creationists - but goes nowhere in counteracting the arguments for natural selection and evolution	1997-06-21
