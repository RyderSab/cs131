Very practical as the source code provided follows the examples very well with some very good examples. The exercises are also good and I recommend anyone reading this book to do them. It was very enlightning to have examples that really worked. It was also very enlightning to have REAL examples and not just cheesey examples that do nothing.	2001-04-01

It by far exceeds any attempt by other authors who have  tried to write a programming book for financial models. I like this book  because it was written with a tool that most people do not use and forces  you to try compilations on other compilers. One drawback I have is that the  source code is not included and that is why there are four stars and not  five. If you are going to write a book that has software the examples have  to be easily available. I just don't get it why these financial guys have  such a hard time with this.	2000-08-29

This book is shockingly incomplete. I could not find any details on FP even though the book mentions it as an argument and leaves it up to the reader to figure out how Excel uses it. Also, the examples are so elementary it is sickening. For example, when the book explains SAFEARRAY the example given is for a one dimensional array. BIG DEAL. The real challenge is dealing with multi-dimensional arrays. I was surprised by the lack of detail in this book especially coming from Microsoft Press.	1998-06-03

Though, it may be a little intimidating<br />to one with little background but coming from<br /> an engineering standpoint it is the only book<br /> about derivative pricing that makes any sense. It<br /> is clear, no shortcuts are taken and nothing beyond simple ODEs are assumed. I especially like<br /> the appendices at the end of each chapter which<br /> gives the derivation of many of the models presented. It would be nice, however, if solutions to the problems would be provided. I have tried to read many books on probability, stochastic processes, and martingales but this is<br /> the only book I have found that does not contain a lot of formalized junk but yet is theoretical enough to make many generalizations for pricing other derivatives.	1997-08-15

This book is one of the best sources of information on differential equations I have seen. I took a differential equations course many years ago.

This book gives a great review of differential equations to owners of Maple. The examples are excellent. However, the book is plagued with typos that cost me a lot of hair and time. Otherwise, I recommend this book to anyone who wants to review this topic and has access to Maple. Not for the beginner though	1997-07-24

This book brings home some of the issues  that have plagued mankind for centuries and how man has never been able to learn from past mistakes. Knowing this  as Jim points out makes for excellent investment opportunities abroad. After reading the book, one becomes  familiar with the geopgraphical, cultural, and economic  climate of the areas Jim has visited. Some of the adventures   that Jim describes, such as the face-off with the Frenchman  in Zaire, and the battle on the border in Argentina, sound  kind of suspect. All in all this book is highly recommended.	1997-03-13
