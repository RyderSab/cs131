Most of the reviewers liked it.  The send-ups were funny as heck, but I found the story to get sillier with each passing page. Eventually the story (for my taste), felt too silly and unnecessary and I could not finish it. The rating should be 3 stars for those that enjoy a light, entertaining read.  I'll try to finish it at a later time when I feel silly.	2005-07-11

Green is a wonderful new start in a series on Private Eye, John Taylor. The man with a gift for finding things. In this case, the usual wayward daughter of a rich client.  Without having to repeat the synopsis that has been well described by previous reviewers, the book is a fast read and thoroughly enjoyable that gets better with each passing page.  Suspend disbelief and let the story take you on it's journey that is part comedy, horror and adventure. Some parts are a little cliche but these are \\"send ups\\" that make the story fun and enjoyable. Sort of like a Twilight Zone on acid. The various odd characters (like the Collector and Shotgun Suzy) are fun and memorable, and we'll learn more about them in the succeeding novels.  Enjoy!	2005-07-04

Just finished Return to the Whorl and was totally blown away. There are other reviewers here at Amazon, who have made convincingly cogent arguments in favor of this magnum opus of Mr. Wolfe's. Of which, I would equal to James Joyce's Ullyses or even Homer's Odyssey but on a much more cosmic and grander scale. The saga starts out with Patera Silk a priest, who serves the gods of mainframe. The question of who are the gods and the instrumentality that enables them ends with a wonderful character, Horn. The conclusion sadly ends in this final Volume of the Book of the Short Sun. The odyssey is complex yet coherent. The questions asked were many. The answers were clear and subtle at the same time. A wonderfully personal work that is well written and honest. The book bears repeated reading and will be a Classic for years to come. As one reviewer aptly put it.  Good Fishing! Good Fishing! Good Fishing!!!	2005-06-01

I came across this book quite by accident and glad that I own it. The story is about Two Presidents.  One good, the other an instrument of the fascist political machine.  Eddie O'Hara is the real president (the people's choice), fighting for his life and identity against good old Uncle Sam.  O'Hara is struggling to regain his memory after a terribe terrorist attack against the White House.  Left for dead, and with a new identity, it's a race against time as the forces of evil want to see real president, Eddie O'Hara dead and forgotten.  A plot that crackles with crisp prose makes this book enjoyable and the characters totally real.  I stayed up late into the nite with this one.  Enjoy!	2005-01-16

My first glance at Sleeper; thought it might be a spy novel.  Then when I read the reviews, I was hooked.  Sleeper is about a dormant monster hidden beneath the Pentagon.  Once awakened, tears people apart.  The novel clearly is modern \\"pulp\\" horror at it's finest. What started out as a corny novel, goes totally against cliche and gets better with each passing page.  The story begs, who is the monster? The psycho-social archetypes of war, terrorism, monsters and society make this \\"weird tale\\" a strange and eventful read.	2004-09-16

Judgement, is the continuation of the Finder's tale from A Mist of Prophecies. Gordianus and family are enroute to Alexandria to find a cure for his ailing wife Bethesda. Additionally, Gordianus also has to disperse Cassandra's ashes in the Nile river (his former lover).  Whereupon, our hero comes into contact with a desperate Pompey wishing to kill Gordianus and put his head on a pole! The historicity crackles as we meet Cleopatra, her little known brother Ptolemy and of course, Caeser. I look forward to more of this series from Steven Saylor. Thank you.	2004-09-16

Good horror literature as this, is indeed rare. Deeply dark without being prurient.  Each tale is a fantabulous mind-bending trip of Lovecraftian proportions. All the tales (stand seperate), form a cohesive binding whole that makes the Unspeakable, speak. Each story is a \\"penny dreadful\\" written by the exo-outerly enigmatic Lord Weyrdgliffe of the Waughters. Highly recommend this in small doses on those nights you want to be creeped out!	2004-09-16

The Scar left me \\"Scarred.\\"  The Scar is a sequel that can be read on it's own is wonderfully written and set amid the floating pirate city called Armada that travels Bas-Lag's oceans looking for plunder.  The characters were diverse and interesting as the Mosquito men, the Cactacae and the Re-made. The city of Armada led by a Sado Masochistic duo called the Lovers is hurled headlong in a near suicidal vision quest, searching for the source of the Thaumaturgic Power of Possibility Mining. (I'm sure a whole book could be written on this fictional subject alone). On top of that, Armada is also faced with a hidden invasion by an unseen enemy. The alien Grindylow. With all this action, the nilhistic heroine Belis Coldwine left me cold.  See the excellent review by Barbara A. Fisher who clearly shows us in detail the problems with the novel. In giving China Mieville the benefit of the doubt,The Scar is an interesting study in the dynamics of metropolitan multiculturalist politics. Plus how society on a whole, deals with leaders that are out of control, in this case the Lovers. Perhaps there is a little bit of Bellis Coldwine in all of us and what we hate about her is what we hate about our self indulgent voyeuristic selves.  The Scar left me feeling spent, wounded and somewhat de-flated after reading it, but that may have been a good thing in that I see a lot our society reflected in the Scar; challenging the insanity of the ruling elite and choosing our own destiny.<br /><br />One final but important pet peeve of mine was that in Perdido, we had the benefit of a map showing us the details of New Crobuzon.  In the Scar, there is no map to distinguish the oceans of Bas-Lag and it's relation to Armada and also to understand the myriad different \\"landings\\" of boats that made up Armada.  For someone to have put-in so much detail in a story, this was an unfortunate omission.	2004-08-19

The only redeeming quality to the book is the plight of preserving the artistic treasures of Rome.  All too often because of corruption, greed and apathy, many of Rome's finest artistic landmarks and works get lost to oblivion.  Another illumnating aspect is you see how depraved some priests are and all the cases of priests abusing children don't seem as far fetched when you read this book.  The plot was convoluted and the characters totally un-sympathetic. I enjoy adult stories like the next person, but the titillation went overboard for the sake of sensationalism.	2004-06-10

Alastair Reynolds' Chasm City is an excellent sequel to his first book &quot;Revelation Space&quot; (pls see my review).  Chasm though a sequel, can definitely be read on it's own and has a much tighter and deeper plot.  Revelation Space got too jumbled in the end but was enjoyable nonetheless as it was a groundbreaking work.  I would have liked to learn more what had become of the frozen captain aboard the Nostalgia For Infinity.  In Chasm, the setting is the planet Yellowstone where there is a melding nano-plague virus slowly affecting all the implants and machines (as in the first book).  Our hero, a man named Tanner Mirabel has traveled light years seeking revenge.  Searching for the ever elusive Argent Reivich, the man that killed the woman he loved along with his best friend.  Meanwhile, the virus has taken hold of Chasm city, once considered the jewel of the galaxy.  Now after several years of onslaught by the plague, Chasm city takes on nightmarish proportions.  Built in a gigantic chasm where the rich live in a fantastic canopy of dizzying heights and architecture.  The poor live in the lower strata, called the mulch and are hunted by the rich for idle sport.  The story also dovetails with the past in a very interesting way regarding the founder of Sky's Edge, the enigmatic Sky Hausmannn and his rise to power (which is a story in itself).  There are many interesting parallels in the story to the science and politics of our times that will pique your interest.  The issues of gentics, memory and identity throughout the story are intriguing to the point of making Total Recall look like a walk in the park.  Hey one day, I'd like to be cryogenically frozen too!!!	2004-06-01

Evil Unveiled is the 2nd half of Speaks the Nightbird.  Vol 1. Judgement of the Witch, was the first half.  Both books are the wonderful recent additions from the fabulous mind of Robert McCammon.  A sordid look at America's past.  Particularly the during the time of the Witch hunts in the 1600's. An excellent mystery is underfoot when an innocent woman is charged for the crime of Witchcraft.  A young law clerk (filling-in for the ailing Judge Woodward) is faced with discovering the truth. During which time (no pun intended), the bodies start to drop. The writing style and the characters are well drawn and memorable.  Makes you truly appreaciate the concept of &quot;innocent until proven guilty.&quot;  Enjoy! P.S. this book reminds me of John Barth's &quot;The Sot Weed Factor.&quot;  Also a great read, very satirical.	2004-04-29

All of RM's books are great, my personal favorite was Wolf's Hour (see my review).<br />Thank you Robert McCammon.<br />In addition to this book I also highly recommend &quot;Instance of the Fingerpost&quot; by Iain Pears.	2004-01-05

Especially when I got half-way through.  Despite the book's minor shortcomings, the plot and concept are brilliant.  I will definitely get his first novel Cross Road Blues.  FYI, I love the blues and play sax in a couple of bands. Blues music is an American art form that has many shapes and faces and Ace thankfully, is one of them.  Reading the book made me appreciate the blues that much more. The story is based on Ruby Walker, a famous blues singer who was wrongfully sent to prison for a crime she did not commit.  When she said, &quot;Iam the Blues,&quot; I was hooked.  In comes Nick Travers, blues historian and all-around good guy. Whose faced against a famous fictional evil character named Stagger Lee, made to be very real and throroughly hateful.  As our hero digs up the past, bodies start dropping. Culiminating into a good read.  Peopled with colorful characters you want to know more about. &quot;Leavin&quot;, keeps you thinkin.<br />I look forward to see more from this author.

Pulver was enjoyable and was so creepy, I started seeing things while reading in to wee hours of the morning.  Mr. Pulver takes you into the realm of the unbelievable and makes it very very real.  The villain is a modern day Jack the Ripper, who sacrifices his victims to the Great Old Ones (GOO).  Namely Kassogatha (Cthulhu's consort demon goddess). Pulver's knowledge of Lovecraftian arcania is wide and deep. I particularly enjoyed learning about some of the music associated with the Mythos of Lovecraft.  The book would easily make a fantastic movie.  The only draw back (a minor one), is that the story could have been edited down by about 100 pages as much of the dialoge was too much fluff to the story but fun to read anyway.	2003-10-06

Immediately it is one of his best and most enjoyable works to date.  The book is good enough to be read on it's own but is best enjoyed by checking out the previoius 2 novels, \\"Rubicon\\" and \\"Last Seen In Massalia\\", (Checkout the great review by the reviewer Booksforabuck.)  Changed by the vicissitudes of time, we see our protagonist, Gordianus the Finder older and more worldly and confronted with the tragic death of his intriguiging lover Cassandra.  A seeress of unknown origin who dies in his arms and who's prophecies were urgently sought after by some of  Rome's leading matrons.  At the funeral, no one attends except  the very same group of women observing the funeral rite from a discrete distance. Here is an excellent view at  the behind-the-scenes look at the feminine Roman mindset.  There are numerous flashbacks that reveals the plot and Gordianus' state of mind in an interesting way that is at once personal and prosaic.  Notice, as we age it is natural to reminisce and Gordianus does that in a such a way to make his dilemma of loss and pain all the more real and convincing.  Looking back at the past plots from the earlier books (makes you want to re-read, the Venus Throw and Murder On The Appian Way), brings Mist of Prophecies in sharp focus to the state of affairs in Rome, (the fall of the Republic) and the rise of Ceasar.<br />The similarities between ancient Rome and our world and are so close that there is much to consider; economic upheavals with a poplulation deep in debt, war, rogue politicians causing trouble and plenty of grandstanding and intrigue to keep you awake at night.  A must read.  Enjoy!	2003-09-09

A riviting story that kept you turning the pages, wondering what the mystery of the chronoliths is all about. Some interesting similarities to today's societal issues (crumbling infrastructure, rising political factions etc.) The idea of time loop stories have always been fascinating to me.  The ending (which seemed to have been rushed by the editors) was interesting and totally unpredictable with a cogent twist. The characters were quite memorable and had a human face.  I would like to see a sequel of this story as there were numerous threads left unanswered, but that depends upon how you look at the plot.  The merit of the novel outweighs it's minor flaws (some answers you have to discover for yourself) and I would freely recommend this as a must read.	2003-08-18

Batavia's Graveyard,(The True Story of the Mad Heretic Who Led History's Bloodiest Mutiny) by Mike Dash, is a memorable work of maritime history that truly captures the spirit of the age. Those were the days of the spice trade where massive fortunes were made and lost. It was the year 1628, the Dutch East India Company sent it's newest ship, the Batavia loaded with treasure (fit for a king!) on her maiden voyage to the isles of Java.  With a bird's-eye view, you see a mutinous revolt that is sparked by lust, greed and madness in the early days of the enlightenment.  Batavia's Graveyard reveals a microcosm of the human condition at it's worst and best. Many scholars have said \\"history is written in blood.\\"  Batavia's Graveyard proves it. Warning: this tale is a \\"gripping account of murder and treachery.\\" The research in Mr. Dash's work is thorough and erudite. The perfect book for the beach. Enjoy.	2003-07-21

As far as police procedurals go, this is sort-of ok.  For my taste though, the characters are a little flat and too one dimensional.

Taking place far far in the future you have a story full of spies, cyborgs, aliens and all the hi-tech you can imagine.  An epic that spans time and space, is truly thought provoking. The characters are well drawn and memorable.  Easily, this novel would be considered \\"hard sci-fi\\" as it is in league with Gene Wolfe, China Mieville and Eric Nylund.  In this story, one scientist named Dan Sylveste has made an arecheological discovery with far reaching implications of galactic proportions.  As Dan Sylveste closes in on the answer to the mystery of the disapperance of the Amarantin peoples, an assasin lies hidden ready to strike.  The story moves along but gets hung up at the end with too many unanswered questions and begs the sequel (Chasm City). The book deserves a rating of 3.5 stars where the benefits of the book outweighs the chaos at the end. A good purchase nonetheless. Enjoy... Makes you want to get an implant!	2003-06-29

Seeing the name made me think of Herman Melville and I was curious.  Seeing that he (China) was not indeed a &quot;Melville&quot; and all the awards this book won, made me take a closer look. The other reviews were interesting also, either some loved it or hated it. I was not disappointed and neither will you.  The story takes place on a future Earth anaolg called Bas-Lag in the city of New Crobuzon, (which is an amalgam of London, Manilla, Bombay, New York and any ther cosmopolitan center.)  Where our hero, (Isaac Dan der Grimnebulin) let's loose a pandora's box of problems provides an excellent allegory to today's human condition.  Though long at times you are rewarded with a thought provoking work that spans broad spectrums of sentiency and introduces new paradigms in the genre of Science Fiction. The characters are well drawn and memorable.  The story just gets stranger and more &quot;out there&quot; as you go on to find out what happens in the end.  One of my favorite characters is Jack Half a Prayer.  I'll never look at winged creatures the same again. A must purchase.	2003-04-23

The second book is even better.  Thomas is recalled to the Land once again, to continue the battle against the legions of Lord Foul. In Illearth, we meet new characters and are reaquainted with some of the original heroes.  All the characters come alive and the plot is tightly woven into a cohesive epic.

I first read Wilbur Smith's &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot; and thought it was a heck of a good read.  River God, also by Wilbur Smith will sweep you off your feet!  I loved this story, it will stay with me for a long time (probably forever).  You'll laugh, cry and thrill to the chase! For anyone interested in ancient Egypt (or antiquity in general), this book is a must.  Some readers were put off by the seemingly endless accomplishments by the humble eunuch slave Taita. Let's face it, he had to live by his wits if he was to survive.  Today, Taita would be considered a polymath or genius by our standards.  Being a eunuch, he is divorced from the drives and desires that keep most men slave to their passions.  When reading the ancient historians (i.e., Tacitus, Lucan, Caesar etc.), most aggrandized themselves and their personal roles in history.  Just looking at the entire civilization of ancient Egypt you can see how that culture made important contributions to civilization that is with us to this day.  The Greeks, Romans and all the great religions owe a big debt to the ancient Eqyptians.  A lot of research went in to this story and the probability of the events in the book are very high indeed.  In River God, The depecition of politics, greed, lust and the human condition are timeless.  To me, the success of a book of this caliber is that it makes you want to read more about the subject matter.  Remember this is a work of fiction (the dynastic reign is fictionalized) so sit back, relax and let your imagination soar. When I grow up, I want to be like Taita...

A Test of Wills by Charles Todd is a great concept and first book of a series.  The History is first rate, but the mystery plot could have been a bit more exciting (however realistic procedurals are sometimes filled with frustration). The setting is post World I England in the small town of Warwickshire.  Our hero, Inspector Ian Rutledge of Scotland Yard has returned home from the War badly shaken by his experiences.  Suffering from shell shock aka \\"post traumatic stress disorder\\" he is tormented by Hamish, the voice of a young Scotsman he executed for cowardice.  (Some reviwers did not like Hamish and found him distracting.  I found nothing wrong with it and is an interesting study in obsession).  Upon Rutledges's return, the inspector buries himself in his work and his first case is a scapegoat of failure. Involving the brutal murder of a beloved colonel and the man suspected is a holder of the Queen's cross. There are some interesting twists that will keep you reading further. The history and the setting crackles with realism.  The murder grabs your attention and the procedural gets better as you go along.  At first, I found the other characters to be wooden and full of cliches.  After some thought, (my pinhead) realized that we are looking at the world through Rutledge's eyes.  Surviving the war, those eyes and his outlook on life possess a knowledge that goes beyond that of everyday folk. An existensialism of his very own, if you will.  Highly recommend!  Thank you Mr. Todd.	2002-11-05

Cold Water Burning by John Straley is the latest foray of Cecil Younger the private eye.  In this outing, our intrepid hero (who is on the wagon) is caught up in a nasty investigation involving a murder of a family.  The more Younger digs, the more bodies turn up.  An excellent tale that reaches heights of poetic expression without being corny.  By far the best novel of Straley's to date.  Though all good, this one is quite touching. The descriptions of the folks of Sitka could be like that of any small town America.	2002-10-17

In Green's Jungles (Book of the Short Sun, Book2) By Gene Wolfe, is the 2nd volume in the short sun series. All the books are tied together (see the books of the Long Sun) in many ways. One excellent reviewer said this book is for the SF thinker rather than the SF reader and I agree.  You have to THINK HARD about what is being said and done. Getting past the omni-linear track of the plot (for me) was the hard part, but becomes very clear at the end and holds your interest.<br />Here is a good Editorial Review that helped me understand the plot better: 'In Green's Jungles follows narrator Horn as he voyages to the planet Green (Blue's companion) and to the abandoned generational starship known as the Whorl in search of the godlike Patera Silk. As Horn recounts his adventures, his own identity becomes muddled (very), and we find out his interactions with the vampiric inhumi of Green and the strange alien Neighbors were deeper than we knew (and how). In fact, Horn may not be himself at all anymore. Tantalizing story details drip slowly from Wolfe's pen:<br />Through the ring a Neighbor saw him, and she came to him in his agony.... she said, \\"I cannot make you well again, and if I could you would still be in this place. I can do this for you, however, if you desire it. I can send your spirit into someone else, into someone whose own spirit is dying.\\"<br />So who is Horn? Has he become Patera Silk--it seems so, for people begin mistaking him for the heroic leader. Is he the warrior king Rajan, or is he something entirely new, formed by the strange places and people around him into a savior of worlds? Identity, love, and faith weave through the themes of In Green's Jungles, and Wolfe has added another masterpiece to a shelf full of them.' --Therese Littleton --This text refers to the Hardcover edition...<br />During the story's narration, we notice a marked change in Horn as his search for Patera Silk continues.  The change, gradual at first.  Starts little by little, but as each of Horn's recollections become known, we are spotting inconsistencies, and his voice is becoming that of Patera Silk, Horn, Lord Rajan and Master Incanto all in one.  The confusion is known by us (the reader), but only sensed or felt by Horn et al. Mr. Wolfe's mastery, becomes abundantly clear as you get towards the end of the book.<br />As I mentioned in my earlier reviews, these works bear repeated reading to fully comprehend. The prose and style are 1st rate. One amusing reviewer wrote \\"Horn would greatly appreciate the quality of the paper in the Hardcover edition.\\"<br />Enjoy and grow!as each of Horn's recollections become known, we are spotting inconsistencies, and his voice is becoming that of Patera Silk, Horn, Lord Rajan and Master Incanto all in one.

The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever: Lord Foul's Bane by Stephen R. Donaldson, is a sheer masterpiece! I normally don't read fantasy but from reading the reviews here at Amazon, I thought I'd give this a try.  I was NOT disappointed in the least.  The story is of a man named Thomas Covenant who is a leper, a pariah in his community shunned by all.  Without giving away too much of the plot, our very reluctant hero is transported to another dimension where he is faced with a very real battle of good versus evil.  What makes Thomas special is that he is thought to be the incarnation of the mythological hero, Berek Half Hand (cool name huh?)  Also, Thomas posseses a ring of white gold that is the key to untold power in battling the dreaded Lord Foul the Despiser and his minions.  All the characters are fully brought to life in this tale and are fully believable and can have whole books written about them. The only complaint that I have, though very minor is that the map at the front of the book could have been a little clearer. Some of the text and diagrams were hard to read but not too bad. I'm looking forward to the Illearth war and can't wait to read it!  If you'll like this, check out Gene Wolf's books of the Sun series, there you'll see some similarities that'll make you think.	2002-09-23

Now several years later, I come across Darker Angels (though out of print, I got from the used section at Amazon and the service was EXCELLENT!). Here, Somtow weaves another fabulous tapestry of horror, fantasy and history all in one! (Just reading the other better reviews is proof positive.) We even get to see the origin of the most foul Cordwainer Claggett [sic] a villain we met in MOONDANCE. In Darker Angels, the multi-level narration by the different players is fantastic (though at times tricky but works out well in the end). Just a word of warning, this book is not for the faint of heart or the easily offended. I look forward to more from this author. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!	2002-08-25

On Blue's Waters is the start of a new trilogy by Gene Wolfe, that are The Books of the Short Sun. The story takes place fifteen years after the Book of the Long Sun, where the inhabitants of the planetoidal starship, the Whorl were forced to flee.<br />Horn, the narrator of the earlier work, now tells his own story in a simple clear prose that is straightforward yet filled with twists at every turn. The narration is a mixture of journal entries looking at past events, the present and dovetailing along the future with references to the book In Green's Jungles. Life is hard on the newly settled planet of Blue with very little or no technology. Horn and his family have made a decent life for themselves and he is regarded by all as a good character of man. Whilst the city states of Blue grow, there is a burgeoning need to establish civil rule. Horn is the only one who can locate the once great leader Patera Silk, and convince him to return to Blue and lead them all to prosperity. Horn sets sail in a small boat (reminiscent of the Odyssey), on a long and difficult quest across the planet Blue in search of the now legendary Patera Silk (reported to be maybe on the elusive island of Pajarocu or the planet Green). Along the way, our hero meets some fantastic characters each of whom can have a novel unto themselves. One of them is Seawrack, a beautiful sea siren and Babbie an intelligent 7 legged boar-like creature. Then there is the enigmatic inhumu. A highly intelligent alien race of space vampires (who are shape shifters), just to name a few.<br />The book can stand on it's own but I highly recommend reading the Books of the Long Sun first to know who and what Patera Silk was all about. The pathos, irony, the plot and prose are all well done and Horn's tale of adventure and struggle, will be with you for a long time. These works will be celebrated for years to come as exemplary 21st Century literature. Blue aptly makes-up for any shortcomings in Epiphany of the Long Sun (the end was little confusing but this book clears up a lot of that). As with Mr. Wolfe's stories, the end continues to ask more questions. So, the only drawback to this work is you'll want to start reading the next book, In Green's Jungles. Thank you Mr. Wolfe!n (the end was little confusing but this book clears up a lot of that). As with Mr. Wolfe's stories, the end continues to ask more questions.

Epiphany of the Long Sun: Calde of the Long Sun and Exodus from the Long Sun (Book of the Long Sun, Books 3 and 4)<br />by Gene Wolfe is a continuing saga of the books of the Long Sun series.<br />As with art, (which these books clearly are), it sometimes takes repeated readings (and countless musings) for the meaning to be fully understood. When reading Wolfe's novels, there is always the hidden truth that things are not always what they seem. Epiphany is the continuation of the intrigue and revolution that grips Viron. A city within the \\"Whorl\\" that is a giant starship of planetoidal proportions. Some questions are answered in this book but new plots are introduced. For example the politics and culture of the women of Trivigaunte. The mystery of the novel persists and continues to ask, who are the gods of Mainframe? The sequel: On Blue's Waters (The Book of the Short Sun, Vol 1) should make-up for any short-comings of this work. The end was a little confusing and leaves you wanting more. Dr. Crane was one of many great characters! The question persists, when will we meet the mysterious god called the \\"Outsider\\" who initially gave Patera Silk his enlightenment and the inspirational mission to save Viron? You are left wondering, are the gods indeed supernatural? Or are they something created by something else?<br />In these works, there are numerous parallels to our society, literature and ourselves. A good example is that there is some similarity of General Mint to Joan of Arc. In my humble opinion, the true epiphany of this work is we are all part of Viron here on Earth, our \\"Whorl.\\" Highly recommend!	2002-06-13

The story is of Patera Silk, a devout priest whose future is enmeshed with the gods he serves, takes place within the Whorl, a giant, cylindrical starship that has traveled for generations and is faced with political rebellion and war. Through a series of strange events, Silk finds himself caught up in intrigue and espionage, running against a major crime lord, befriending a cyborg soldier, and encountering at least one of the gods of Mainframe.  All of the characters are rich in detail and truly engaging. Oreb the talking bird is my favorite! The books of the Long Sun stand on their own but is also part of the universe of the books of the Short Sun.<br />The mysteries in the Book of the Long Sun are clear (though abstract at times, rewards the reader with repeated reading). THE LONG SUN gradually introduces a plot that will later shakeup the city of its setting and by the end of the four-volume work totally change the Whorl in which the characters live. The transformation of Silk from naive dogmatic priest to a secular authority of sophisitication is interesting and enlightening. These stories are a part of me and will stay with you too long after you've read them.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.	2002-04-08

The Case gets you emotionally involved from the very start.  I've heard of Crumley and always wanted to check him out.  I was not disappointed and neither will you.  Set in a fictional mid-western city called Merriweather, you are drawn into a sordid world of booze and drugs along with a great cast of misfits and neerdowells.  Though dated, the hardboiled writing style and the plot, touches upon timeless themes of love and death that never grow old. As a matter of fact, the dated quality of the story makes it that much better.  You are transported to a time (late 60's early 70's) that is at once familiar yet strangely abstract because of the never changing human condition.  Highly recommend.	2002-04-08

Mr. Dunning's character, Cliff Janeway is a wondrerful sleuth that we learn more about in this outing, set in the beautiful state of Washington. We also learn more about the fabulous world of literature and the book business as well. At times, the plot gets complex when a rare copy of Poe's The Raven is up for grabs and anyone who has a copy of it, gets murdered. I felt that most of the characters were well portrayed and are quite memorable. Without giving the ending away, I felt that the loose-ends at the end of the story, could of been resolved a little better. However, a good story leaves a question or two unanswered to make way for the sequel, (if one is indeed in the works.) Also, life is full of mysteries and anyone who claims to have all the answers is either a charleton or a fool or both. The plot and characters return to me in different ways and continues to ask the never ending question; what makes complicated people do certain things? Some reviewers either loved this story or hated it. Either, or; this book makes you think twice about book the industry and the people who make books happen.	2002-02-18

Reading Doug Greenberg's most excellent review here at Amazon hit the nail on the head.  Jame Lee Burke's writing style was quite good but the plot became rather anticlimatic and too one dimensional.  True, one has to read this definitive first book in the Robicheaux series to fully appreciate the later books.  Robicheaux reminds me of John D. MacDonald's famous detective, Travis McGee (who is the definitive hardboild protagonist and is way hard to beat).  Robicheaux lives on a houseboat in New Orleans instead of Florida and is fighting his own personal demons with alcohol, injustice and getting even.  The VietNam veteran angle has been done to death, but in this outing is somewhat tolerable by the excellent narrative descriptions.  Personally I had a bit of a problem with our hero waxing poetic about the Confederacy and the South that looses me, a Northern city boy. To me there was nothing romantic about the civil war, and a character that seems to honor that (Confederate) memory, and want to fight for the little guy is a bit of a contradiction in terms that needs more exploring.  The reviews for the Purple Cane Road looks more promising and is next on my list and should be a better read. Kindly look for my review in the coming weeks.	2001-12-28

The Unburied by Charles Palliser though a little tricky, was EXCELLENT and a real pleasure to read! The story, set in England; circa late 1800s, was extremely well written and researched. With forays into early English history, Church of England politics and hints of pre-Freudian analysis, this novel is packed with twists and turns at every page. Alan Collins' excellent and articulate review (here at Amazon) is quite accurate and to the point. If you like multi-layered period mysteries, read the excellent 5star book, \\"An Instance of the Fingerpost\\" by Iain Pears. Also a very engaging and thought provoking work that should not be missed. I can't wait to read the Quincunx. Thank you Mr. Palliser!	2001-12-04

Sword and Citadel; the 2nd half the New Sun series, (both books) have no equal in literature. The better reviews (see Chris McCallister's right-on review), at Amazon are more articulate and indepth, help you appreciate the scope of this work. Written in a wonderful memoir style prose, the story proceeds with our hero, Severian (an excommunicated journeyman torturer), making an Odyssean adventure to ultimately unravel the mystery that is the instrumentality and power of the supreme ruler, known as the Autarch. Faced with the crises of the sun going extinct, the obstacles of war, unexplained phenomena and the perils of health, life and limb. Our hero unfolds to his destiny, from near death to resurrection (he is a type of Odysseus, the perfect hero for all millenia). The images and symbolism is at times indeed difficult to understand, but the story gets through. The author keeps your attention and makes you think of things you never thought of without being preachy or condescending. In Mr. Wolfe's omniverse, everything is not always as it appears to be so there is subtlety at every turn.<br />Sword and Citadel answers a lot of questions from the the previous book (Shadow of the Tortuer and Claw of the Conciliator).  However, an epic would not be an epic if there is not something to make you look forward to.  In this case, the book of the Long Sun series...<br />I can not say enough that these works bear repeated reading to fully appreciate them.  I highly highly recommend.<br />Thank you Mr. Wolfe!	2001-11-20

Previous reviewers have clearly pointed that out in much better detail. Mr. Wolfe is in a class by himself and will be celebrated for years to come. Immediately, you are gripped by the mystery as to who are the people of Nessus and the instrumentality that is the Autarch that rules them. Meet Severian, a torturer who changes the lives of those around him and himself. Mr. Wolfe weaves an intricate tapestry that is multi-layered, full of twists and turns that are engaging and enlightening. Part fantasy, part horror, part science fiction and part love story. The only category I can give it is 21st century Lit. There are a lot of fantastic elements in this series. The characters are varied and full of curious interest (each character could have a novel unto themselves). After reading this book, the plot will come back to you in different ways. I have gained new perspectives when ever thinking about the far far future of &quot;Urth&quot; and the role of technology. At times, the story becomes abstract in a poetic kind of way (that makes it at once personal), only to reward the reader with crystal clear reasoning later on. Reading does at times require a little mental stamina, but just hang on and enjoy. The sequel, the Sword and the Citadel, Second half of the Book of the New Sun series, is even better. When I finish that, look for my review. Thank you Mr. Wolfe.	2001-09-08

Our young hero Nick Aten (rhymes with Satan), starts off as a typical youngster but ends the story a true hero. Perfect for the teeange crowd and for adults. Mr. Clark did a fantastic job of keeping the story moving along at a good pace. It also felt like a story of the Odyssey versus the Nite of the Living Dead. Lots of action. Some readers may have felt that the story was at times too violent. The truth be told, the end of the world is indeed unponderable and quite frightening. We as a rational people must be aware of those possibilities and learn to avoid them (i.e., man's terrible proclivity to self destruct). The story ending, which is interesing in and of it self, gives way to more possiblities of sequels and future conquest of the &quot;creosotes&quot;.... HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

I.e., the many historical references to forensic science, witchcraft, religion and gender politics (past and present).  Thankfully the author did a lot of research. Our heroine indeed was a little &quot;unpredictable&quot; but that made the story somewhat interesting, and yes titalating. There are one or two loose ends you would have to figure out on your own.

I agree with the reviewer, SHEL99 that some of the grammar and character buildup leaves at times, a lot to be desired.  SHEL99 is also correct that some of the rhythmic irregularities are due to the fact that Mr. Hamilton writes in a British style.  A book of this type of far reaching vision would no doubt have some cracks and weaknesses in it.  I feel that the ideas put forth by Mr. Hamilton far outweigh what little grammatical or character inconsistencies there are in the book.  In real life there are character inconsistencies all the time when people come in and go out of our lives... (think about it).  At present, I'm working on &quot;Expansion&quot; and am finding it better though at times it does seem to meander.  When I feel burdened or disturbed by the story, I'll read something else and come back to the Reality Dysfunction epic with renewed interest for the characters and the wanting to know what will ultimately happen.  True the Emergence ended screaming &quot;sequel&quot; but that's what we the reading public want. To start another story.  With regard to the violence and sex; what I've encountered so far is part of the plot and not too gratuitous.  Also, when thinking about aliens, they (the aliens) will not have a shred of humanity so how can anyone criticize that actions of the aliens are too violent?  Granted, some of the images in the book are graphic and disturbing, but think about the future.  The survival of humanity will depend upon how we deal with the &quot;unthinkable.&quot;  I'll write another review when I've finished the series.  Add this to your list of &quot;gotta have...&quot; you'll think about this story for a long time.<br />Enjoy! Dr.Eclipse.	2001-05-09

My Favorite is the &quot;Barrens&quot; by F.Paul Wilson.  Cthulhu, a totally evil entity from beyond space and time has fascinated the imaginations of many people and will continue to do so in this contemporary send-up.  All things Cthulhu should be a genre unto itself!<br />Signed,  a former Miskatonic graduate.	2001-03-27

I first chanced upon RRM's fantastic &quot;Hour of the Wolf&quot; (see my review). Before purchasing Swan Song, I read a lot of the reviews and hoped Swan Song would be worth it.  Just reading these more in-depth reviews made me BUY THE BOOK. You will not be let-down.  Swan Song has to be one of the most disturbing and scariest yet uplifting books I've read.  As far as apocalypse novels go, this one is IT!  My only criticism is that RRM's ending, once again screams &quot;Sequel.&quot;  BUY THIS BOOK and be greatful we live in a fairly &quot;normal&quot; world (for now at least).	2001-01-09

I re-found this book after losing it.  Some years ago, after reading the book, I lent it to someone and they lost it and I since forgot the name of the author.  Not to be confused with Lawrence Block's &quot;Bernie Rhodenbar&quot; character (I thought wrongly &quot;Booked to Die&quot; was a Lawrence Block creation.) I love mysteries and especially mysteries involving books!  &quot;Booked to Die&quot; is both, and a great story from start to finish.  John Dunning's Cliff Janeway is a real interesting character and one you won't forget.  BUY THIS BOOK!  You'll be glad you did and you'll learn something about the book business.	2001-01-04

I was not let down.  The book though fictional poses a very realistic intimate peak at Hadrian the man and the Emperor. Focusing on the man (rather than a whitewashed idealistic view of the  Emperor), the author's attention to detail and painstaking research makes this work believable and thoroughly enjoyable.  In the &quot;Memoirs&quot; you learn something about roman politics, psychology, and philosophy.  Also, you get a closer look at the eternal issues of life and death, what every human must face.	2001-01-02

Repairman Jack is a must read, even for the most jaded fans of the mystery/thriller genre.  I discovered F. Paul Wilson when I read &quot;The Barrens&quot; (an excellent short story in the tradition of HP Lovecraft but with a very modern twist).<br />I then purchased &quot;Legacies&quot; and at first thought it would be the usual type of villain and the obligatory sex scene thrown in for good measure.  I was totally wrong!  The plot and characters are engaging and realistic.  Especially the NYC backdrop where areas are mentioned in and around my neighborhood in Manhattan.  I even stayed up a few nites until 3am and was gratified (you will be too) at finally uncovering the mystery with Repairman Jack.	2000-12-05

(Just finished his &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;: great book but too long).  The Cobweb is a frightening peak at the production of bioweapons of mass destruction, made of course in America, and sold to, you guessed it, Iraq.  The scenario/plot is realistic enough but the dialog and characters often seem rather contrived and formulaic.  If you have nothing else to read, this book is it. At least you'll learn what &quot;cobwebbing&quot; is.  IF you have another book that's better, read it instead.	2000-11-28

I purchased Thomas Harris' book &quot;Hannibal&quot; after reading the celebrated &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; years earlier (which I thought was good but over rated).  Hannibal starts off well. The writing style at times is a little un-even but the story engages.  The descriptions of Florence and other copious asides was interesting, but not relevant to the story and made for a lot of fluff. As the novel pushes onward to it's unpredictable yet predictable climax, I felt a little &quot;ripped-off.&quot; Agent Sterling's ambiguous laconic character left much to be desired.  In reality, she would definitely be gay and more interesting as a person if this were so.  As the ending approached, I had a strong feeling of being let down.  Although my sense of what Mr. Harris was trying to communicate is that in reality people are never what they seem to be.  Too bad it was done in such a round about and uneven way.	2000-11-13

An intelligent and enlightening work that bears \\"re-reading\\" over and over again. Ignore any negatives about this book and BUY it! You will be richly rewarded. After finishing the book I came away with a better understanding of cryptography, English University politics and the mysteries of 18th Century superstition. Another great book of this caliber is \\"The Unburied\\" by Charles Palliser.	2000-11-07

Even for the most jaded of readers.  From the first pages to the very end, this book will keep you at the edge of your seat.  Our hero, Michael Gallatin will occupy a place in my memory for years to come.  Mr. McCammon's work is a powerful tour-de-force that gives new meaning to &quot;LIVE FREE OR DIE.&quot;  The ending screams &quot;sequel.&quot;  Where is it?	2000-10-17

After reading \\"A Signal To Noise\\" ..., I immediately read this one and was greatly impressed. Mr. Nylund's treatment of a rather mystical and spritual approach to problem solving and plot building is indeed enlightening. I highly recommend this book to buy and await any sequel or more of this type....	2000-10-17

Then decided, I HAD TO READ THE FIRST BOOK!  Mr. Nylund's vision of the  future is a fantastic &quot;roller coaster ride&quot; in cyberspace that  will leave you breathless.  Some of the imagery was hard to conceptualize.  But after dusting the cobwebs off of my imaginative processes, I found the  book to be a very powerful look into the future.  The multi layered plot  was tight and captivating.  The math was on the money too.  Where's my  neural implant???	2000-09-18

I've stumbled across &quot;Games of the Hangman&quot; by accident and was hooked by the non-stop action.  Now 5 years later, I stumbled across  &quot;Rules of the Hunt&quot; and am enjoying, once again the very  dangerous adventures of Hugo Fitzduane.  Indeed looking forward to reading  the &quot;Devil's Footprint&quot; (look for my review).  Mr. O'Reilly's  prose is straightforward and clear with a very tight plot.  The characters  come to life and the action sizzles.  Not for the weak of heart.  Terrorism  is a very real threat that Mr. O'Reilly brings to light in all it's dark  reality.	2000-08-23

Wilson.  Neal Stephenson's attention to detail is thought provoking and enlightening.  The book starts off in WWII and takes us to  the present with flashbacks all the way.  Each of the (past/present)  stories are captivating and worthy on their own merit. Thank you Neal!	2000-03-14

Cthulhu 2000: A Lovecraftian Anthology was a fascinating book and fun to read.  It's obvious that all things &quot;Cthulhu&quot; (where science fiction meets the occult), is now a genre unto itself. My personal favorite is The Barrens by F. Paul Wilson: &quot;In a tangled wilderness, unearthly lights lead the way to a world no human was meant to see.&quot; After reading The Trail of Cthulhu by August Derleth I HAD to read all HPL and have since been hooked.  If you like tales of Cthulhu and his minions, do checkout a fun satrical book, &quot;Resume with Monsters&quot; by William Browning Spencer.	2000-03-14

The Death of Ivan Ilych and Other Stories by Tolstoy is a wonderful collection of short stories by the undisputed master. Ivan Ilych is a middle class man who receives a fatal injury from an accident. Then trapped in illness and caught in the long throes of death, looks back upon his life.  Within his musings and perspective you discover more about the man called Ivan Ilych. A well written and thought provoking piece that will stay with you for a long time. Highly recommend.	2000-03-14

The Widower's Two-Step left a lot to be desired.  The murder in the beginning and the investigation was interesting but peters out.  As the book progresses the story looses steam. It seems the editors rushed the ending  and the book leaves a number of loose ends hanging.  Hopefully The Last  King of Texas will be the better go-round.	2000-03-14
