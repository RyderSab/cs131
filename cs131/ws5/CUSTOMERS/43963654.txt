It's even more confounding when vendor applications (such as the ever-popular SAP) dispatch their own tasks independently from Oracle.<br /><br />Dr. Hall has an excellent section on setting-up an Oracle scheduling environment and he show the sophisticated features of Oracle scheduling including establishing job classes and granting scheduler privileges.<br /><br />But this handy book goes far beyond the basics, and Hall shared his real-world experience in chapters dedicated to time-based job scheduling (i.e. run this job every second Wednesday at 3:00 PM) and he shows working example that will save the reader many hours of manual computations.<br /><br />The real meat of \\"Oracle Job Scheduling\\" is where Dr. Hall explains the process of chaining jobs together with dbms_job and dbms_scheduler.  Hall covers the most complicated aspects of Oracle job chaining including the conditional execution of Oracle tasks, and working examples that show how to create a robust jobstream with built-in error checking.  He also includes details for job failure notification and shows how to alert the staff using the utl_smtp protocol package.<br /><br />But Hall does not stop there.  He goes far beyond the Oracle documentation and shows working examples of using the new Oracle job monitoring features and the reader can see exactly how to use the Oracle job monitoring functions to monitor and kill scheduled Oracle tasks.<br /><br />Halls opens-up his personal experience in chapter 6, advanced scheduling Topics, and show never-before seen techniques for setting scheduler object attributes and the concept of \\"Instance Stickiness\\".<br /><br />Dr. Hall has a long history of explain complex Oracle concepts with clear, easy-to-understand examples, and this book is no exception.  Hall is provided an online code depot, replete with working examples of complex job streams, an invaluable time-saver for the Oracle professional.<br /><br />I also like the price, as I'm getting weary of shelling-out $50 for mediocre Oracle books and it's refreshing to see that Rampant van offer a high-quality 288-page Oracle book for only $9.95<br /><br />My copy of Oracle Job Scheduling is already filling-up with dog-eared pages and post-it notes, a sure sign that other Oracle professionals are going to find this book to be an addition to their Oracle libraries that they will actually use everyday.and shows how to alert the staff using the utl_smtp protocol package.<br /><br />But Hall does not stop there.

Oracle Streams is a great replacement for the older standby-database technology and it's is also a great alternative to Oracle RAC clusters when you need a synchronized database at a remote location.<br /><br />Best of all, Oracle Streams is a great way to set-up a disaster recovery server, and also use the standby server to accept database traffic.  Tumma did an exceptional job on this book and I highly recommend it for anyone considering Oracle Streams as a failover or disaster recovery solution.<br /><br />Madhu's text goes far-beyond the nuts-and-bolts and he shares real-world secrets and techniques for using Oracle Streams in a mission-critical environment.  If you need to understand high-speed Oracle replication, this is a must-have book.	2005-05-15

As the editor for this book, I'm probably biased, but Steve Andert has carefully condensed the work of noted Oracle wait event tuning experts into a concise, on-point book.<br /><br />Free of theory and jargon, the text explain Oracle wait event tuning in plain English and has an excellent code depot of working scripts to explore the Oracle wait Interface and get started fast finding Oracle bittlenecks.<br /><br />Best of all, it's half the price of other books on the subject!	2004-11-18

Mike has always emphasized the importance of disk I/O in Oracle tuning and I'm glad to finally have a whole book on the topic.<br /><br />The text is very Oracle-centric, concise and shows all of the areas where Oracle performance declines from a bad disk layout.  Rather than just being an overview, Ault dives deep into the I/O internals and shows at a microscopic level how Oracle interacts with the disk I/O sub-system.<br /><br />This is one of Mike's best books in years, and that's really saying something.	2004-11-04

Using these CS tools, Millsap explains the internals mechanisms of the Oracle engine.<br />After dusting-off my 1970's Calculus texts (thank God I took 4 semesters of Calculus), I was able to start this epic tome.<br />This is not an easy read!  While not quite as slow as reading Ulysses (James Joyce), expect to spend many hours digesting and understanding the mathematical equations and concepts in this text.<br />For those with the appropriate College-level background (A Masters in Computer Science or Electrical Engineering), the book is wonderful (or so I'm told, I'm just an MBA).<br />Packed with queuing theory and advanced CS concepts, Millsap does a wonderful job applying the CS theory with the operational working of Oracle, especially with respect to wait event analysis.<br />The section of using SQL*trace and 10046 trace files are the hallmark of the Millsap approach, and Cary has done a wonderful job explaining this is plain English, with lot's of references to the v$ structures.<br />The only shortcoming of this book is that it may be too advanced for marginal Oracle professionals who do not possess the appropriate math and statistics background to appreciate the illustrations.<br />With respect to technical accuracy, the book is well annotated and researched, and the only issue I found was that Millsap's explanation of the pdf Poisson distributions were \\"fishy\\". (Sorry, I couldn't resist!)<br />Otherwise, this is an outstanding technical resource, worthy of the practicing Oracle database administrator.	2003-10-11
