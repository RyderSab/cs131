I did not particularly enjoy the reader; I felt the main character's voice was too high, and another's voice sounded too contrived.   But the story was quite entertaining and imaginative in spite of some parts stretching credibility, but that's why it's called fiction!  There is a lot about Africa, African tribes and the Sahara, which is wonderful.	2005-07-27

The reader is extraordinarily skilled, and this book includes a number of  twists and turns in the story and some pretty interesting confrontational events too.  There is some moralizing, and some thoughts on Africa which one might not wish to spend time reading, but for listening, it's ideal. <br /> <br />Readers/listeners should start with the first book in the series.	2005-06-19

I felt more detailed directions and pictures would have been helpful.  The directions are pretty simple, and the basic sock pattern good for beginners.  I needed to get help from another knitter to be able to finish a sock, even with the book.	2005-02-01

His description in Chapter 7 of Briony thrashing plants on the island, the description of the church and the house, are just extremely good writing. I also liked the way he gave the reader insight to the kind of person Robbie was by describing his room. <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, but sadly, I could not finish it.  I am a slow reader, and after plowing through Briony's experience as a nurse, I just was stuck and could not continue.  Still, I think it is a superb book, one that is enjoyed more for the reading itself than the story.	2004-10-23

It is small enough to keep by the bedside.  I found comfort in it, reading a passage each night. <br /> <br />It makes a nice gift for someone who has suffered a loss.  It does not need to be given right away however, as I think people need time to recover from the shock of a loss before considering getting through the grieving process.	2004-09-20

I liked reading about two related women and their lives hundreds of years apart.  I like the theme of having a connection with ancestors, and it makes me wonder what I do or say that is drawn from my roots. <br /> <br />The main character was self-centered, weak and not particularly likable.  Her husband was out of touch with her, but she didn't do much to help him understand what she was going through. He was uncomfortable with her skin condition, which I think was part of why she drew away from him. <br /> <br />The book was an easy read.	2004-09-17

How could Leo steal the fresco, and then put it back so no one noticed?  How could mass be conducted in a church which was seriously damaged in an earthquake?  How could a priest be fooled into thinking he was seeing an angel with the use of a film projector? I'm glad I read it, but I do feel it is not well written, including odd choices of words and repeating some things too much, such as discussion of Marta's anger.	2004-08-29

I haven't enjoyed a book this much in a long time.  <br />About two-thirds of the way through the book, there is an update in which three of the characters tell their own stories--then switching back to the story as it was being related.  I did not object to this change of pace, but it was different.	2004-04-02

This is a very good book for people who want to strengthen their backs, especially the upper back, and improve posture.  The exercises (one to a page) are clearly explained, but not with too much explanation so you get lost, and the author tells how each exercise helps you. There are simple little drawings of people to show how to do each exercise. The exercises are not difficult, and you do not need to do dozens of repetitions. The book is a good size, not too big, and lays open flat.<br />There are also sections on posture, walking, and how to do activities of daily living so as not to cause further damage to the back. This book was recommended to me by my physical therapist, and I know it will make a difference in my life now that I know what to do to strengthen my back. I had been working with weights, which was fine, but I was missing some of the small muscles that support the back.	2004-03-17

There are so many hints at things to come; the reader is left hanging just too many times. There are too many long explanations of historical events, theories, art.  The main characters continue to be  chased by the police, like some Hollywood concoction. All that is missing is a car chase.  The storyline is so convoluted that I felt I could not take another twist or explanation.  To be honest, I cannot finish the book.	2004-03-02

This story of a free black man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery is amazing.  I know nothing of how it was written and sometimes questioned whether it was genuine or not because sometimes the writing was so eloquent, but after reading it I realized the author had some help from the editor, David Wilson.

I will read his next book also. The glossary in the back is very helpful, but I wish it had been more extensive.  Also, in the paperback, the printing on the map is too small to read.<br />It did seem odd to me that an educated person like William Williams found himself among such cutthroats.  Why was he there, and why did he stay in the face of the horrors they committed?<br />If you like boats, adventure, pirates, this is a good book to read.  <br />And, it's a good time to read this book and contrast it with the summer's movie from Disney, Pirates of the Caribbean.	2003-08-02

(It might provide more information than some people want.) Even though it is very readable, I wish it had been edited a bit.  There was quite a bit of repeating points.  The boxes and charts were helpful though, and nothing was too technical to understand.<br />Also, I tried to put together the supplementation Kessler advises.  It isn't easy to do without taking a lot of pills.  <br />Overall I would suggest this as an excellent book for women especially who are concerned about osteoporosis.  It can inspire readers to do something about the possiblity of being hit with this disease--to take charge instead of just hoping it doesn't happen.  I'm glad I read it.  Even if a reader only does one or two things learned in the book, they will be better off for it.	2002-08-11

It was as if Kingsolver had certain messages to convey to the reader, and she inserted them into conversations that seemed almost lecturish and overly long.  Over all, however, it was a wonderful book.  Kingsolver's writing is richly descriptive and the characters are well drawn.	2001-03-24

Linenger isn't a great writer, and the book could have stood a little editing, but I felt the author did a very good job of sharing what life in space is like.  He answered many of my questions about life in space and explained technical and scientific matters in a very understandable way.  When he said part of Mir looks like &quot;four buses were driven into a four-way intersection at the same time&quot; I have no doubt about what Mir looks like!  So what if he seems egotistical and complained a lot.  He took time to write a very readable book about a rare experience.	2001-02-01

It wasn't worth it.<br />The book is the story of the search for the killer of two young people.

That would not be the kind of person Kit would care for.<br />Parts of the story were pretty good, like when Kit threw away the letter, but overall I found it terribly slow with lots of uninteresting reading.	2000-12-03

The story itself in this book is utterly charming, and the pictures of the animals and the snowman are fabulous.  But something is lacking--the flow of the text or something just isn't quite right.

How could the skinheads possibly think they could get away with kidnapping Cassie?  And when kidnapped, Cassie rather took it in stride which seemed odd.  Cassie's relationship with Tony is too strange to believe, and saddling Tony's sister with Auntie Liz indefinitely also doesn't seem too realistic either.  Further, I don't believe a professional like Cassie would invest much time in discussing the case with the local pizza worker, Todd. <br />On a positive note, the book was well organized, and the author did a good job of ending each chapter in a way that encourages the reader to keep reading.	2000-10-16
