Kingsolver has done a wonderful job giving the reader a sense of what happens when your average apple pie American gets thrown into a jungle environment where no one wants to hear missionary banter about Jesus.  Told from the point of view of four daughters, the maniacal Tata Price relentlessly tries to convert the 'heathen' Kilanga residents to god fearing Christians, only to ultimately enrage both his family and village, resulting in a tragic conclusion.<BR>My only criticism is this: Although I always enjoy follow-up at the end of a story as to how everyone's life transpired following the main event, I felt that it was a bit overdone.  I appreciate knowing where all the daughters ended up, but by the last chapter, I really wanted to just have them go away.  So, that is why I gave it a 4 and not a 5, but in all, it is a wonderful novel.  Also, anyone who is interested in following up on the Congo should also read King Leopold's Ghost for a real glimpse at the horrors that took place in the Congo.	2001-09-05

The publisher might want to rethink the blurb. But, I read it anyway, and am thoroughly impressed not only with the style of writing, but also with the complexity of the situation presented.  In a novel where books are banned because they cause too much 'free thinking' and 'confusion' for those who fail to understand them or don't want to read them, there are a lot of fairly frightening similarities to the way society is progressing today.  Granted, I don't believe we will ever burn all the books of the world, but it is a cruel reminder how many people are ignorant to the importance of books, whether fiction or non-fiction.  It also reminded me how much I enjoy cracking open a new book with its characteristic smell and feel, and how much I, as a reader, would miss that privilege.	2001-07-18

Mr. Ridley has a rare virtue not often bestowed on scientists to explain the technical world in a way that a non-technical person can grasp and learn concepts without getting an additional degree in genomics.  Throughout the book, he addresses each chromosome separately and then ties the concepts together by giving examples of how each gene might interact with others to make the human being as a whole.  Although a lot of the writing is part theory/part fact, I highly recommend it to those who want to learn a little more about the stuff with which we are made.	2001-07-18

Recently, however, my sister, a history major, gave me Gods and Generals to read, and I was amazed at how little I remembered about Jeff Shaara's skill for depicting war.  Gods and Generals gives the reader a wonderful sense of each character's motives and makes one feel as if they can smell the smoke from the battle.  As it covers the Civil War before the battle of Gettysburg, I will now be reading the Killer Angels again, since I am positive that I must have missed something the first time around.	2001-07-18

The bonus that comes from reading Toxin, however, is the topic of food preparation and food-borne illnesses.  The author recommends the book &quot;Spoiled&quot; at the end, and after beginning to read that there are a lot of other questions that have arisen in my mind as to how safe the preparation of meat is, and how have I (being partial to rare meat) not gotten any diseases yet?  So, although the story line itself is slightly weak, the thought provoking qualities of the book improved its rating.	2001-05-02

The story of Lin's plight to divorce his wife in a society that does not accept such practices for the average worker is both eye-opening and compelling. It is important for anyone with an interest in China to read this novel for a very well written (although somewhat depressing) portrayal of the struggle of the average man.	2001-02-01

The answer is that he can't...but he certainly does a wonderful job at debunking some academic myths and giving an interesting general overview of how civilization came to be.  Since little is ever mentioned of Polyponesian and Micronesian society in American history and sociology classes, I found that aspect of his studies to be very interesting as well.  I would recommend this book to anyone with a genuine fervor for history, but it is mainly an entertaining book, not a undisputable historical tome.	2001-01-16

Although I was not totally absorbed with the storyline of the Brethren, I found that it suited its main purpose...to be fun reading material while commuting on the subway in the morning.  The idea of the three judges in prison exploiting closet-bound gay men through pen pal letters was somewhat innovative, but I felt that a lot of details were left out, and it strongly affected the plot.  In addition, I felt like the ending was rushed and inconclusive as if Mr. Grisham had tired of the characters and needed to finish up for the publishers.  All in all, as I said before, however, it is entertaining.	2001-01-16

Cruel and Unusual, however, was not her best piece by a longshot, but seemed to be more of a 'filler' segment in the ongoing saga of Kay Scarpetta, medical examiner extraordinaire.  As a scientist and hopefully a doctor in the future, I find the tone of the author to be condescending to the average reader's knowledge of science and forensics in general, however.  I think enough Discovery Channel crime shows would cover the same material she describes over and over again. In any case, it was an entertaining thriller, but I enjoyed Point of Origin and Black Notice more.	2000-11-11

I found a lot of stereotypical characters and scenarios and it didn't grab my attention as much as his other novels.  I think Deaver hit something really good with the Lincoln Rhyme series, because Bone Collector and Coffin Dancer were outstanding, but this tale of a disfunctional police officer/family and the 'cult'/'moon' killer was much more weakly portrayed.  I think I will stick with my buddy Det. Rhyme.	2000-10-24

She said it took her about a year to read it on a casual basis but it was well worth it...I have to agree.   Although I think the size of the book could intimidate the most avid of readers, the story is a riveting and refreshing look at the long lost kingdom of King Arthur and the struggle for freedom of religious belief.  The most prominent factor which sets this epic aside from other tales of Camelot, however, is that it is beautifully written from the perspective of the women both in and out of Arthur's court.  Giving a voice to the characters which are usually left on the backburner in many Arthurian legends, mainly from the view of Morgaine and Gwenhywver, was a wonderful twist of plot.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in historical epics.	2000-09-22

Rowling's continually awesome imagination.  I was hoping, after counting down the days from when I preordered it in February, that I wouldn't be disappointed from hyping myself up too much. I should  have known all along that the book would be as entertaining and magical as  the first three.  Harry starts to do a lot of growing up in this book.  I  wish the series had come out when I was at a similar age as Harry, because  I think that Ms. Rowling has a wonderful knack at portraying the trials of  early adolescence and classmate rivalry.  But the most important point is  that one doesn't have to be a young adult to love the books. I find myself  calling mean people 'muggles'in place of less nice phrases, and wishing  that I could use Summoning Charms when I am too lazy to get off the couch  to get a ringing phone. I can't give enough stars to these books and can't  wait for the fifth book!	2000-07-30

The first time I read it, I closed the book with a feeling of awe and enlightenment at the final revelations and lectures of Morrie.  Mitch  Albom's historical record of an amazing teacher's final months and final  struggle with a dibilatating disease showed sensitivity and bravery rarely  found in fiction or non-fiction alike. But, in order for the lessons of the  book to truly work their wonders, I believe I will reread this book every  couple months, just to remind myself how special life really is.	2000-07-30

Although I am sure I don't represent all 20-30  something unmarried women, I find it difficult to comprehend some of the  scenarios with Jane's dating patterns.  For example, I would think most of  us would avoid seeing a boozer older than our fathers.  Perhaps that is  just me.  All in all, however, the story was captivating, and I really  enjoyed the last section of the book where Jane turns to a how-to book for  dating advice.	2000-07-10

It doesn't entirely make sense, and some of the themes are a little wacky, but it is  still very entertaining and fun to read.  Vonnegut manages to use plenty of  his traditionally biting humor throughout the book and deals with neutron  bombs, eccentric artists, criminal coverups, and life after Ohio is  obliterated.

First of all, as an opponent of the death penalty, I think this novel describes perfectly the horrors of being forced to face death, as well as  the tragedy of an innocent being put to death.  It also beautifully  illustrates the hardships and prejudices that many people, especially  African Americans, endured in the past, not only with the law, but with  acceptance in society as well.  I hoped throughout the entire novel that  Jefferson's fate would change, yet knew it never would, due to the  ignorance present in the white community by which he was judged.   The  whole novel was written from the heart and was very inspiring, in spite of  the sadness involved.	2000-06-02

I give brownie points to the author for trying to create a 'thriller' out of theoretical quantum mechanics, but he tried too hard to  make such a complex theory accessible to any Joe on the street .  I realize  that is what bestselling authors are supposed to do to entertain the  audience, but it lowered the rank of this book considerably in my mind.   While the medeival scenes were often engaging and enjoyable to read, the  characters of the students (Kate, Andre, and Chris) were quite annoying and  unconvincing. Their adventures were beyond far-fetched and unlikely, and  most of their exploits smacked of your typical Saturday morning cartoon  where the good guys always end up winning by some miraculous intervention.  So, although Crichton is one of my favorite authors, his attempt at quantum  time travel in this novel was fairly feeble and unpersuasive.	2000-05-19

Rarely does a reader finish a book and not know where to start in explaining the virtues of the story, but the wonderful complexity of all the characters' lives really made an impression on me.   In saying that, I can't really give an accurate sense of the story in 1000  words to anyone reading my review, but I can say that Homer Wells and Dr.  Larch's saga is a tale of an epic adventure in the life of an orphan and  his acquaintances, the issue of abortion and adoption, and the unspoken  (but well known) rules of life.  Then, I saw the movie...and realized in  the opening 2 minutes what I already knew. It is impossible to fit such a  complex story into a 2 hour movie, let alone 40 years of Homer Wells's  life. So, that was a little dissappointing.  However, the novel was an  unbelievably good read and I recommend it especially to us Mainers, as it  gives wonderful descriptions of the Maine of 50 years ago.	2000-05-12

I am not very tolerant of women who have a low self esteem and don't wish  to improve themselves by any other way than losing weight or counting  cigarettes.  So, needless to say, the calorie counting banter was not my  cup of tea.

However, I ended the book fed up with the fact that there  are some women that settle for ho-hum mediocrity in life and love, and was  thoroughly depressed for not only Ellen, but her messed up family as well.   I also, incidentally, wanted to yell at my significant other for anything  he did that wasn't 100% nice due to the anger and frustration I felt upon  reading the novel.

There is no doubt in my mind that the writing style and meticulous detailed writing of Mr. Cunningham is exquisite, but as far as  the plot was concerned, I was left wanting much more than what was given.   Having read virtually everything by Virginia Woolf, I was impressed by his  portrayal of her character, but the intertwining of the others that was so  strongly applauded by critics did not entirely put me in a state of awe.   The novel, as many of the reviewers pointed out, presented the flaws of  humankind, but it did not make me care one ounce about the outcome of any  of the people involved.  I was left with a lackluster feeling of something  that was unfinished, when I had anticipated some sort of epiphany, judging  by the acclaim the book has received.	2000-03-15

The imagery was well written, and the story-line had potential,  but all of the themes involved were so disjointed that finishing the book  left me with a very incomplete feeling.

I find it hard to believe that a woman with such a  background of violence in relationships would be attracted to a hot-headed  drunkard mercenary.

US	51096368	RR4AXQCFPSN72	0899684246	982930987	The House on the Strand	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Interesting story but leaves a lot unanswered	I really enjoyed The House on the Strand because Du Maurier made wonderful transitions between the 14th century and the present in the novel, and entwined these transitions with an interesting story line.  From a  scientific point of view, however, the author left a lot of things very  vague in relation to the drug, possibly because it is a wild and  imaginative idea to have a &quot;time control&quot; drug, but I would have  preferred a little more detail.  No one even mentions what this  drug-weilding professor really researches throughout the novel. But, taking  all into consideration, it was a very intersting book	1999-10-21
US	51096368	R1IYU3NHMPKX9F	0198577796	691180398	Genes VI	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Great resource for Molecular Biology	I really don't understand the individuals who reviewed this text as &quot;confusing&quot; or &quot;not fit for students&quot;. As a beginning text for those interested in the art of molecular biology, this book is  great. The diagrams are mostly clear and the reading is elementary level if  the technical terminology is removed.  There are a few mistakes throughout  the book, but some of them are due to recent discovery since it was  published.  The text makes me wish I had Mr. Lewin for a professor because  one can tell he would be a talented teacher.	1999-08-31

I was so disappointed with this book due to its lack of depth and overabundance of trivial issues and teenage immaturity. One can't call it a childrens' book either (although that is how it reads) because of the  explicit and annoyingly frequent sex-scenes. Then again, it is far from an  adult piece because of its lack of maturity and significance. I think Blume  is underestimating the intelligence of the average adult reader by thinking  we would care about Vix and Caitlin and all of their raunchy and pathetic  love adventures. If a picture of a loin-clothed Fabio was on the cover, it  would give the reader more of an idea of what they were considering  reading.	1999-08-17

The plot was weak and unfounded, the  portrayal of the fraternity members ridiculous and stereotypical. Perhaps  Mr. Kean should do that thing called &quot;background research&quot; before  he writes another novel.	1999-08-17

I found the book to be riveting and worthwhile reading...until I got to the last 30 pages. I was extremely  disappointed with the ending and found it to almost be a cop-out for the  author to hand it over to the publisher.	1999-07-27
