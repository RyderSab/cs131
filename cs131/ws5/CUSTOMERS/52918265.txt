This is an above-average entry in this highly uneven Interpretation series.      Olson has a 'canonical' approach which, while accepting critical views of the Bible, makes them secondary. And this Interpretation series is geared for pastoral application.  Nevertheless, his critical assumption sometimes overwhelm his interpretations.  I would not use this as my first or only commentary on Numbers.    Often lively and original, this makes solid (and readable) supplemental study for the student who wants a range of opinions on the text.	2005-10-06

Thank goodness for his students who have made his ideas accessible.  Well, actually alot of his students have not done his legacy any favors.  Some have made his views seem more extreme, smug, and novel than he ever intended. <br /> <br />Not John Frame.  A master of making difficult concepts readable and enjoyable, Frame has written a real masterpiece once again. <br /> <br />This is not a slavish Van Tillian diatribe.  instead, Frame knowledgably, clearly, and carefully presents Van Tils views, humbly offers some corrections, and lets the reader decide.  In the process he utterly changed my mind on the issue of presuppositional apologetics.  A long-time fan of Hodge, Warfield, the Old Princetonians, R C Sproul, etc., Frame convinced me of the inconsistencies I was holding onto. <br /> <br />A must read for any serious student of epistemology, apologetics, Reformed history, etc.	2005-10-06

He has a PhD in systematics and has taught at Westminster Theological Seminary, but he's also been the beloved pastor of a large, vibrant Presbyterian church in Scotland.  He's written something like 30 books, and he has a gift for clear but deep writing.    The cover of my edition of this book, printed in 2005, is not overly cheesy (as the last reviewer charged).  But an older volume in this series (Ferguson's Let's Study Philippians -- also great) does have an awful cover, so my guess is they updated it recently.    The chapters (73 in all) are short and accessible.  They are packed with reliable and lively exegesis, with a theologically strong redemptive-historical approach.  He pauses to make solid and penetrating practical applications as he goes.  There are additional study questions in the back that tie themes from various chapters together.    If I were to pick just one commentary to use for a small group Bible study of lay people, or a teacher's guide for an adult Christian ed. class, this would be it.    Other good commentaries for teaching and preaching:   R. Kent Hughes (1989, Reformed sermons, solid if a little less than contemporary); Tom Wright, Mark for Everyone (2001 --excellent concise exegesis and insights.  Yes, the NPP theology is troublesome at a feww junctures, but it does not come into play here that I see); Mark Horne (2004 -- Reformed, PCA, lengthy -- references Austin Farrar alot); William Lane (NICNT -- extensive exegesis).	2005-09-30

This was my basic text for an intro. theology course I took at Princeton, where Dr. Migliore was teaching.  He is classically trained, very disiplined, and a real gentleman. But, as this book demonstrates, he can't be termed a great theologian.  While he claims to be a Barthian, and he does use Barth's categories, he would not be recognized as such by Barth.  He might be described as more a \\"string of pearls\\" thinker -- he takes things he likes from a variety of contradictory sources, with no apparent anchor or controling principle. What you get is more of a \\"mood\\" than a tangible response to God's voice in Scripture.    This is a very weak, very inconsistent, very frustrating work. I hardly ever score things poorly on Amazon, but I had to comment on this when I saw the other glowing reviews. There are all kinds of good theology texts, both to the \\"left\\" and to the \\"right\\" of Migliore.  Louis Berkof, for example, is a classic that is clear and helpful.	2005-09-25

Really the only reason is if you want one that includes the Apocrypha (though the New Annotated Oxford NRSV is probably better).    Format issues: The typeface is light and difficult to read.  I don't know if it comes in better binding, but the hardcover format I used was not as comfortable and attractive as most leather Bibles.    Content:  The notes are less extensive than some other study Bibles (for example, NIV Study Bible) and are mostly just annotations.  The contributors have all decided against the validity of much of what the Bible reports and advocates. They are far too critical, and as a result the usefulness of this book is diminished. Unlike, say the NIV Study Bible or the Reformation Study Bible, the HarperCollins Bible would not be very helpful for personal devotionals, small group studies, etc.  It spills too much ink trying to show how the Bible isn't really accurate and trustworthy before the user can start trying to make application to their life. Highly skeptical Biblical criticism has its place, but for a study Bible it seriously handicaps the work.	2005-09-25

But otherwise I find his writings sometimes a tad narrow.  And I think he seems to fail to see the irony in the ways his own Biblical readings are shaped by psychology (esp. Behavorialism).  The contemporary CCEF authors are better, I think.    But this book on marriage is about the best short summary of the key texts and applications I've found.   The only major flaw: in chapter 1 (pp.8-20) he wisely asks what the most foundational purpose of marriage is.  He rightly refutes certain cultural answers -- procreation, happiness, sex, etc.  These are important but secondary. But then in the end he chooses an equally problematic answer -- marriage is primarily a 'covenant of companionship.'  Doesn't Gen. 1-2 say that?      But, I wonder, if companionship is the foundation of marriage, then what if one partner is not being a loving companion?  Can the other partner freely leave?  Adams would say no, but he's being inconsistent.  I think the Bible teaches in Gen. 1-2, read in light of Eph. 5, COl. 3, Rev. 21 etc., that marriage's primary purpose is to make us image bearers of God.  Then Gen. 1-2 ('not good to be alone') is saying that a male-female couple together bear the image of God better than one person can alone.    Anyway, if you cut that section out, this is an excellent book.	2005-09-25

This may look like a comic book, but don't assume its authors are shallow! Newman has doctorates in both science (astrophysics from Cornell) and in theology. He understands science and has thought deeply about these issues. But he also has a lively sense of humor and a dry wit. <br /> <br />I gave it a one-star deduction for being a little unfair to the evolutionist. He stacks the deck a little. But, hey, the evolutionists run just about everything, and when was the last time they let someone else have a say? Anyone who doesn't buy into the Neo-Darwinian dogma is labeled by them a *creationist*, lumping him in with Young Earth hicks. So Newman should get a little latitude, don't you think? <br /> <br />The final section is the best. <br /> <br />Go read one of the other more serious Intelligent Design books by William Dembski, Hugh Ross, Michael Behe, Stephen Meyers (Newman has a very good essay in the collection edited by Dembski entitled *Mere Creation*).

The best I have ever read on ecumenism from a conservative Reformed perspective. Dr. Frame is a Yale graduate, seminary professor, and PCA pastor. <br /> <br />He argues that schism is dangerous stuff, always tragic, and not to be entered into lightly.  So, he says, the PCA's leaving the PCUS in 1973 may have been justified, but their not joining up with an existing body like the ARP or OPC at the time was a sin.  They made some amends by merging with the RPCES, which itself was a merger of two other bodies.  Organic union is not the sole test of catholicity, but it is one important goal.  You have to wonder about the PCA and ARP's indifference to even beginning talks of merger.	2005-09-24

Author Bryan Mark Riggs was in his late twenties when he wrote this a couple of years ago. He is a (Reform?) Jew.  At that point he had already earned a PhD at Cambridge, served as a volunteer in the Israeli Army and US Marines, and was teaching at SMU. This book grew out of his (undergraduate!) thesis at Yale. He found and interviewed a huge number of \\"Mischlinge\\" -- half or quarter-Jews who served in the Nazi military during WWII, sometimes with as high a rank as general.    Rigg improbably estimates there may have been as many as 150,000 such soldiers under Hitler.     Many of these men served to escape death. Some were just strong German nationalists.    The interesting part is that both Jewish halakah and Nazi law regarded many of these men as Jews, while most themselves did not! By Nazi law anyone who was 25% Jewish was a Jew whether or not he was baptized, a Nazi Party member, practiced another religion, etc. But those who had already shown loyalty to the German military often were given special exemptions if they continued to serve. Remarkably, most of those part-Jews were proud Germans, with roots in the nation hundreds of years back, who did not practice Judaism. Some were even somewhat anti-Semitic, looking down on the culturally, economically and educationally less advanced (and religiously more Orthodox) East European Jewish immigrants (Ostjuden) as inferior.    Sadly most fought bravely for the very government that was murdering their relatives, and would surely murder most of them when the war was over and they were no longer needed.  (Some lost their exemptions even during the war).    The madness and the vicious absurdity of the Nazis is portrayed very skillfully by Rigg.    Rigg goes on longer than he needs to. But the topic is so engrossing, the mini-biographies so complex and full of contradictions, and the writing style so clear and enthusiastic that I am wanting more.  I will read everything he writes in the future.    The next book Rigg wrote last year, BTW, I just started -- its about how the Lubivitcher Rebbe was rescued from Warsaw during Nazi occupation and smuggled out of the country by cooperation between American spies and a part-Jewish Nazi intelligence agent!  That book is the most unbelievable story I have ever read.  (A Past in Hiiding by Mark Roseman being a close second).    Any WWII buff MUST read both of these.	2005-09-23

Packer's quote pretty much sums it up \\"as a systematic theologian he is highly problematic, but as a practical theologian he is unmatched.\\" <br /> <br />His autobiography, of course, is full of insight, action and devotion.  But the editorial work by Christian Focus here is confusing and difficult. <br /> <br />There is no introduction explaining the methodology of the (unnamed) editor.

I've read a bunch of Dershowitz works (mostly articles) and never agreed with any of them.  His book on ten incidents of injustice from the Book of Genesis was horrible in most every way.    In the Case for Israel he is no less obnoxious than usual, but he finally allows common sense to guide his analysis of the evidence.    There are more than 200 reviews already posted on this book, so I won't repeat all the details.  Bur I found his format to be excellent: 32 short chapters of about 6-7 pages each.  Each chapter gives a brief \\"Accusation\\" against Israel, then quotes from \\"the Accusers,\\" followed by a brief statement of \\"The Reality\\" and then a lengthier section on \\"The Proof.\\"    Dershowitz destroys the arguments of the left-wing media (that he normally finds friendly to the rest of his views), Noam Chomsky, Edward Said of Columbia, etc.    This is Dershowitz's sane twin writing.  He argues very hawkishly, but also pragmatically.  He advocates for Israel allowing a Palestinian state by pulling out of the Gaza and the populated portions of the West Bank, retaining the unpopulated portions and a 7 mile buffer zone.  (Of course Israel offered the Palestinians 95% of the West Bank, plus $15 billion compensation, and apologies several years ago and Arafat walked away from the deal).    My disagreements with Dershowitz are all pretty mild:  1. In chap. 21 he overstates his basically correct case about Israel's religious toleration.  Yes, Israel goes so far as to allow Arabs to be elected to the Knesset.  And they allow everyone to worship in much greater freedom than ANY of their Muslim neighbors do.  But there IS favoritism in Israeli law against Muslims, and also Christians.  Buddhists of Jewish descent, atheist Jews, Wicca Jews, and Jews of any other belief system can make aliyah and get citizenship in Israel, EXCEPT Jews who are openly Christian in belief.  2. His constant criticism of Noam Chomsky is fine (and true, I think), but he crosses the line by speaking ofChomsky's 'secret' agenda.  3. In defending Israel he argues that many of the criticisms leveled against her are MORE true of the U.S.  For example, Israel is accused of conducting tough interrogations on suspected terrorists, but actually, Dershowtiz claims, the U.S. is more brutal on ours.  Israel is accused of political assassinations (they are GUILTY!), but actually, he says, the US tries more of that (against Castro, etc.).  You get the sense that Dershowitz really has less loyalty and grace toward America than he shows toward Israel.  4. At times I think he tends to be not hawkish enough given his arguments.    Anyway, a very good book.	2005-08-19

For more than ten years now Hart has written some of the best American church history around.  His scholarly biography of Machen was widely acclaimed and in some ways set the standard for its genre.      But this book is so utterly foreign to that Hart writing I have come to love.  Balance, and indeed charity, often seems discarded for the sake of savaging the majority views of the OPC during their many controversies.  Hart not only consistently sides with the right-wing minority camps within the OPC, but he shows little respect for the majority.  I gotta say -- you should proceed with humility when your view is one of a minority (right-wing camp) within a minority (OPC) within a minority (conservative Reformed folk) within a minority (confessional Christians)!    The OPC has a long, interesting and, in many cases, heroic history.  Despite the editorializing, much of that wonderful story shines through on these pages.	2005-08-18

In fact, in some ways it is an above-average entry in the generally wonderful (though uneven) Arcadia local history books.  It would make a decent, moderately priced gift for a wide range of folks --- alumni of one of the Princeton schools, former or current residents of the town, those with genealogocal interests and ties to the town. <br /> <br />That said, it will be a little disappointing to anyone with a real knowledge and interest in Princeton history.  Given the massive wealth of photos of 19th century Princeton this work does nto seem to have been as thorough researched or a wisely selected as it could have been.   A read through the acknowledgment identifies the problem -- Smith seems to have relied mostly on the Princeton Historical Society.  The PHS (of which I was a dues-paying member for years) has a wonderful collection, and no doubt Gail Stern and her team were generous and helpful.  But there are MANY other great sources of Princeton photos.  The biggest omission I notice is the Princeton Theological Seminary's collection.  The Seminary has been a presence in the town since 1812.  It occupies 70 acres in teh center of town, bordering the University, and has some of the lovliest building around.  Only 3 or 4 of these are featured in the book, and they are far form the best or most interesting shots I know of.  In fact, the Special Collections department in Luce Library has thousands of great 19th century photos not only of the seminary campus, but of eating clubs, local townsfolk and animals, etc.    <br /> <br />This is just one example.  The University archives, no doubt, has many more items, as do the individual historic churches and organizations, and several private collectors in town.  (One person I know of has hundreds of old Princeton postcards, for example). <br /> <br />This could have been a 5-star book with just a day or two extra spent with some of these other resources.	2005-08-17

Kurzweil's book is not as lengthy and technical as the Avotaynu book, nor as concise and tightly organized as Barbara Krasner-Khait's Discovering Your Jewish Ancestors (2001).  But what it offers is something unheard of in genealogy textbooks - a work that reads like a novel.  He is not afraid to be expansive and anecdotal, even chatty.  His personal stories with genealogy, dating back to 1970, are gripping.  Especially so because Kurzweil (unlike many genealogical authors) knows how to tell a story.  The book is often lyrical and intensely earnest, without being melodramatic or overwrought.  His passion for discovering his ancestral roots is sincere and infectious.  In fact, his discovery of a descent from a famous Hasidic rabbi led him to embrace more traditional Judaism in his spiritual life.    But the book is not ALL personal stories, as interesting as they are.  He packs the bulk of these into his opening chapters, and then sprinkles them as useful illustrations throughout the work.  He covers all of the important topics, and is quite up to date on the online resources (through about late 2003).  He has a great command of the details of doing Jewish genealogy, and he has some very brilliant recommendations for some unique and creative sources. (He was a founding father of Jewish genealogy in the mid-70s, and has given something like 600 lectures around the country).    His enthusiasm is infectious, and he makes strong arguments for the moral and spiritual value for Jews to explore their roots (bolstering his case with short gripping quotes from the Old Testament, Jewish sages, and Talmud).  Further, he makes a good case against cremation (with which this Christian reviewer agrees).    The only shortcomings of the book:   1. As noted above, this is not absolutely comprehensive.  You will want both the Avotaynu and the Krasner-Khait books to fill in all of the blanks.  2. While a good scholar and critically oriented, he is generally a littel more eager than I am to accept oral traditions or unproven claims of rabbinic lines.  See, for example, the material pp.30-34.  At the end he is willing to claim it is `likely' he is a direct descendant from King David, because a certain famous rabbi living 1500 years after David claimed descent from him (how could he know?).  And another rabbi living 600 years later claims to be a descendant of that rabbi, etc.  Four or five jumps like that and Kurzweil makes it to his famous 3x-great-grandfather rabbi. Utterly unprovable beyond perhaps the first or second `jump' backwards, and pretty unlikely. But in fairness, he acknowledges the problems with these rabbinic genealogies.    In any case, a wonderful read, and a good practical tool.    It might make a nice gift for a relative who is mildly interested in their family history, but in need of inspiration to get more involved.  Also, every synagogue library, public library, and local historical society needs to have a donated copy (along with the Avotaynu guide).  And at just $16 (for a beefy, nicely illustrated hardback), VERY affordable.	2005-08-16

Robert Oppenheimer	Books	3	40	63	N	N	Careful, detailed examination, well-written, but unsatisfying	At the risk of getting slammed with lots of negative votes on this review, can I offer a mild note of objection?    First of all, I agree with most of the previous reviws.  This is well-written, thoroughly researched, the most detailed ever produced on Op., etc.  But I am unconvinced by the authors' take on the Communist issue.  Nobody much is talking about this because its been a given for 40 years that McCarthy and crew were nuts or evil or both -- but... the new evidence from the Russian archives and the declassified American files have settled most all of the spy cases of the Cold War.  Seems liberals and conservatives alike now all agree that the Rosenbergs, Alger Hiss, Harry Dexter White and others WERE definitely spying for the Soviets as accused after all.  So it was not all JUST paranoia and cynical political opportunism (though that may have been a motive for many of the accusers).    Oppenheimer is about the only one left who history has not yet proven to have been guilty.  I'm still not sure one way or the other, but what Bird and Sherwin fail to see is that Oppen.'s problems (even if he turns out to be innocent) WERE largely of his own making.  He was his own worst enemy, as the book shows.  The guy poisoned his tutor's apple (almost got him charged with attempted murder) for Pete's sake!  Was Oppen. a communist and a spy?  His brother Frank WAS a communist party (CP) member, as was Frank's wife.  Oppen himself was an active member of CP-dominated teachers' union, signed lots of CP petitions, contributd financially to CP causes through Pop Folkoff, a CP functionary with ties to Soviet intelligence.  He is believed to have written CP of Cal. pamphlets.  FBI wiretaps of CP functionaries mentioned Oppen. as a CP member.  A recently released Soviet intelligence memo referred to him as a secret CP member and friend of their cause.  His wife Kitty Harrison (married 1939) was CP member.    Anyway, Oppen. may not have been a spy, or a threat of spying.  But hesure was less than careful in his behavior.  For all this book's considerable merits, I think Bird and Sherwin downplay this fact too much.	2005-08-11

Even conservative and Reformed circles are little different in this regard than most of the other evangelicals and teh broader secular culture.  As helpful as it has been, the AA approach is not theologically neutral and makes some fundamental errors about human nature that have done some damage.    <br /> <br />The opening case study with \\"Jim\\" (pp.3ff.) echoes many with which I have been involved.  The issue may be pornography, alcohol, drugs, or spending, but the model rarely varies.  Mistakes the person has willfully entered into are lumped together and treated as a 'condition' rather than choices.  Patterns of behavior are a disease.  People will define themselves or others by these problems (see p. 250).   <br /> <br />Invariably, this leads to problems from the start.  People begin to move away from others in the church, in their families, among their friends, because others allegedly 'can not relate' to their specific problem (conditon) (see p. 3).   People can become self-absorbed, rather than willing to address their part in the problem.   <br /> <br />A recent example comes to mind from a discussion I had with someone trying to help a mutual friend who was being self-destructive.  We were discussing the struggles of our friend involved in self-injury, deceit and other hurtful behavior.  I was hoping we could discover some heart issues in this friend.  What was he really worshiping in his life?  What was really important to them?  What are they really looking for, and where are they going to find it?  How does God's grace speak to his self-slavery to these issues?  How can we get the person to see the bigger picture of their life,and how they fit into the Big Story of the Universe? <br /> <br />But the person became frustrated with me.  Could I not see this friend was just a victim of his `condition(s)?'  He was certainly `addicted to affection' from women, and when he felt this being threatened he would become manipulative to get control and attention.  The causes of the problems, no doubt, were a combination of genetic and environmental.  The friend had technical terms (usually with acronyms) for each condition in the long list for the friend.  It seemed that the Gospel was OK for our salvation and for smaller `spiritual issues,' but clearly it was psychology that was best able to address the `big' addiction issues.   <br /> <br />Another example of the formidable practical issues with the AA world view: I have been proposing the introduction of wine as an element (along with a grape juice option) for our observance of the Lord's Supper.   After all, I have argued, if Jesus commanded us to use wine in this sacrament, who are we to say, \\"No, we know better.\\"  The objections in our church have been mild but consistent: \\"What about the `alcoholics'?\\"  My response has been, \\"But the church had plenty of people who drank too much.  Why didn't Paul or Jesus tell us to use grape juice?\\"  And even if abstinence (even from a small thimble full of wine) is the best policy for those who drink too much, how can the mere presence of wine be so damaging?  (For an excellent argument for the use of wine in the Meal, see Jim West, Drinking with Calvin and Luther (2003), esp. pp. 121ff.).   Bill W. trumps Scripture (and common sense and tradition) every time. <br /> <br />This book was an irenic, but vigorous Biblical response to these practical issues.  It has been an indispensable resource in my ministry since shortly after it was published.  My only constructive feedback is fairly minor.  In the \\"Ideas for Public Worship\\" section (pp.271ff.), there is no mention of the role of the Lord's Supper in God-glorifying worship and as a means of grace in discipleship. Further, a subject index by the publisher would have been very helpful.  Also, given the concerns raised in the book regarding approaches that are largely just \\"Christianized AA,\\" why not distinguish these from more fondationally Biblical programs in the \\"Resources\\" section (pp. 287-289)?	2005-08-11

In a nutshell -- he argues that the invasion of Iraq was a strategic flanking move aimed at manipulating Saudi Arabia.  The strategic thinking behind the U.S. strategy here is way too complex and ruthless to explain or sell to the American people, so instead Bush and crew lied and said it was about WMDs etc.   <br /> <br />Friedman says after 9-11 there were just a few options open to us and all involved invading somebody.  The cash flow to Al Queda had to be cut off and that could never happen without the cooperation of the MidEast states.  Before 9-11 almost none were helping on this (in fact Saudi Arabia was our biggest problem).  After invading Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, there are no states in the Mideast that are NOT helping us with al Queda, Friedman contends.  Invading Iraq and Afghanistan was about alot of things, but most importantly it was about getting the Saudis and others to fear and respect us.  Friedman says do not listen to what the Arab states are SAYING, watch what they are DOING.  They all say they hate America, and they do, and they always have, and they always will, but they are doing business with us now.  They weren't before Iraq and Afghanistan.  BTW -- that is why there is a civil war going on in Saudi Arabia right now -- some resist the new Saudi policy of cooperation. <br /> <br />Friedman thinks the Bush administration (chiefly Rumsfeld and his allies) have badly run the war in Iraq.  BUT he argues that its not really about ruling it well, its more about getting Hussein out and about sending a message to the rest of the Mideast.  In that way, its a big success. <br /> <br />Friedman is not obviously partisan.  His criticisms of Bush partly mirror Kerry's: 1. Bush is botching Iraq; 2. the reasons given for the war were partly lies.  BUT he argeus that Kerry's alternative was far worse. <br /> <br />On the WMDs, Friedman argued that it should go without saying that the US and every other intellignce community on Earth believed Saddam had them.  There were outlying reports that contradicted that, as there always are in intelligence, but the concensus of every gov't on earth was that he had them.  Bush did not lie ABOUT WMDs.  What Bush lied about was the real reason for invasion -- getting the Saudis et al on board -- because it was too sinister and complicated to sell to America.  Friedman thinks that was a good and necessary lie.  The Iraq invasion was necessary an a success, but for none of the reasons focused on by the media. <br /> <br />Sidenotes: 1. Friedman dismissed the notion that the U.S. went in alone.  All but 5 of the NATO states supported the action (France, Germany, Belguim, Greece and one other didn't).  France had their own reasons for never getting on board under any circumstances. <br /> <br />2. Friedman thinks Bush should be crucified for not firing the CIA and FBI chief brass on Sept. 12, 2001, the way FDR fired intelligence chiefs the day after Pearl Harbor.  Friedman thinks Rumsfeld is the most clueless player in the administration.	2005-08-11
US	52918265	R3OIPO8LCPEBPI	0310242827	293116887	Sacred Marriage: What If God Designed Marriage to Make Us Holy More Than to Make Us Happy	Books	5	26	27	N	N	My new favorite marriage book	I used to give out copies of Bryan Chapell's wonderful Each for the Other.  Before that my favorite book on marriage had been Mike Mason The Mystery of Marriage.  Thomas is my new favorite. <br /> <br />He shows that the design of marriage is not for our mere happiness.  It is so much greater than that.  Its central purpose is our holiness.  In this approach, God alone is acknowledged as Lord of our lives.  He is central to marriage, not our spouse.  Thomas wants the reader to embrace a Biblical vision for marriage that views all of the joy and sorrow, success and struggle as opportunities to draw closer to God and to grow in grace. <br /> <br />Again and again, the Scriptures show us that all of life (marriage included) is about showing us who God is, how we need him, and may draw near to him through faith alone: Habakkuk's prayer for justice is answered by sending the Babylonians (Hab. 1:6f.); Hosea is told to take his wandering wife Gomer back and bear children with her; the people will be sent into 70 years of exile as a blessing; Job loses it all (Job 1), except the most important thing; Joseph is sold into slavery by his brothers (Gen 37:12f.); following Christ faithfully leads the disciples literally into life's storms (Matt. 8:23-24 and 14:22-24).  All because the Lord loves his people, and desires their holiness more than their immediate happiness.     <br /> <br />All this is obviously true.  Yet, Gen. 2:19-24 may still seem in tension with this: \\"And the Lord God said, `It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helper comparable to him.' \\"  <br /> <br />But as on writer points out, this is about God providing \\"companionship in the labor of dominion.... He [Adam] needs a companion suitable for him in the work to which God has called him.\\"   Marriage in Gen. 2 is not about solving Adam's loneliness, but about giving him a partner in life to fulfill his calling.  A calling, Scripture everywhere teaches, that is primarily about knowing and trusting God. <br /> <br />So Thomas writes convincingly, \\"the challenges, joys, struggles, and celebrations of marriage.. [are to] draw [us] closer to God and to grow [us] in Christian character.\\" (p.12).  For this reason, one friend commented that Thomas' book is less a \\"how-to\\" and more of a \\"what-if\\" book.  What if we pursued God in marriage rather than our own desires for happiness and comfort?  What if we saw the call to serve in marriage as a uniquely potent opportunity to confront our own selfishness? <br /> <br />Marriage is an unmatched tool used by God to refine us, Thomas argues.  He shows how this is true in specific areas of the Christian life.  Marriage teaches us to love (chapter 3), to respect (chapter 4), to pray (chapter 5), to expose our own sin (chapter 6), to persevere (chapter 7), to embrace difficulty (chapter 8), to forgive (chapter 9), to serve (chapter 10), to find spiritual insights in sexual intimacy (chapter 11), to be aware of God's presence (chapter 12), and to develop our spiritual calling (chapter 13). <br /> <br />As Thomas illustrates, Ephesians 5 states that marriage is a living sign of the Gospel.  Marriage becomes the best arena for us to learn how to love better, deeper and more sacrificially, as Christ loves us. <br /> <br />We all desperately need to know that God's intentions for our marriages are so much grander than merely providing an enjoyable companion.  God offers us something far greater: holiness, not just happiness.  He offers us a marriage, through all its struggles and pain, which can teach us how the deepest longings of our hearts can finally be satisfied in the embrace of Christ.	2005-08-11

An amazing value at $4! <br /> <br />Even better for me was Sinclair Ferguson's (out of print) 1981 Man Overboard.  Similar theology to Robertson, about three times as long, and even better (if you can find a used or library copy).  Almost as helpful as Robertson was the old commentary by James M. Boice (PhD, pastor of giant 10th Pres PCA in Philly at the time).	2005-08-10

Welker is a highly respected, Reformed, moderately liberal systematics prof at Heidelberg, Germany and visiting faculty at Princeton Seminary.  The book is attractively packaged by Eerdmans, well organized, and written in a pretty accessible style for such a notariously confusing topic.  But while full of great insights, ultimately I found this book highly dissappointing.<br /><br />Welker starts by sharing some interesting personal experiences with the meal (exhilarating and depressing).  He was saddened, for example, by a Russian Orthodox service where the meal was celebrated entirely behind a curtain.  Finally the priests emerged with a mushy mix of bread and wine in a pot, fed to the congregants with a long spoon!<br /><br />Some of Welker's conclusion are as depressing as that visit to Russia.  He frankly seems to teach that skepticism about the bodily resurrection of Christ is fine (in fact, he seems to argue that teaching a real physical resurrection has been a barrier to faith for many and is itself a cause of trouble in the meal! -- see p. 10, for example).<br /><br />After undermining the ministry of Christ, he moves on to undermine the basis of community.  Beginning with pp. 72ff. (see also p. 146) Welker makes a sustained assault on church discipline.  His sub-chapter heading is unambiguous: \\"The Supper Must Not Be Misused for the Purposes of Moral or Church Disciplinary Control.\\"  No one can ever be barred from the table (literally \\"ex-communicated\\") in Welker's view.  P. 73 states that because those who would sit in judgment are not perfectly 'righteous' therefore they can never seek to shepherd others.  Of course, Jesus orders us to do just that, out of love and hope for repentance in Matt. 18:15-20, and Paul applies this directly to the Supper and other benefits of church community in I Cor.<br /><br />He argues for paedo-communion, but based on his cheap grace ditum (\\"no baptized person should be barred from the table for any reason\\") rather than covenant theology.  He has a whole section (pp. 146ff.) on paedo-communion without any reference at all to the Supper's unity with the Passover meal (where children ate and drank).  He sees a problem with children struggling to understand the meaning of the meal theologically, and wonders if they should really partake before they 'get it.'  But if that is his concern (usually not for other pro-paedocommunion folk) than he might also ask whether they should take it before they not only know but also TRUST and believe.  He may possibly be right to offer the meal to covenant children, but he doesn't seem to be asking any of the most important questions about this.<br /><br />This raises another issue: for all of his ecumenical concerns, his footnotes, index, and ideas evidence interactation with almost no Americans and ZERO evangelicals.  About the only Americans he seems to reference are (liberal and neo-orothodox) colleagues from Princeton (Pat Miller, Dennis Olsen, Dan Migliore, Greg Faulkner).<br /><br />There are MUCH better books out there.  Try Peter Leithart, Blessed are the Hungry; Keith Mathison, Given for You; NT Wright, The Meal jesus Gave Us; Robert Letham; even Gordon T. Smith's new book.	2005-08-10
US	52918265	R2K1AAIL33MOZ8	0801027683	576371184	A Holy Meal: The Lord's Supper in the Life of the Church	Books	4	13	13	N	N	A little gem	The author Gordon T. Smith is a former dean at Regent College, with a PhD from Loyola.  I don't know what theological camp he belongs to (other tahn Evangelical), and he tries hard to be very ecumenical in this work.  The fact that he quotes Tozer and A.B. Simpson 3 or 4 times (inferior sources to the others he quotes - Calvin, Wainwright, Schmemann, C.H. Dodd, Berkouwer, etc.) makes me think he might have a CMA-ish or Wesleyan background.  I read a book he did on calling a few years ago, and it struck me as competent but unoriginal (a flatter Eugene Petersen-esque sort of book), and not as helpful as Os Guiness, The Call or James Petty Step by Step (1999). <br /> <br />Anyway, this new book on the Supper is VERY helpful.  Very concise -- just 114pp. of joy.  Part I (30pp.) is a little cliched and dry, but Part 2 is really amazing.  In seven small chapters he highlights different Biblical aspects of the meal.  1. Remembrance (its not only a memorial, but it is a memorial); 2. Communion (fellowship); 3. Forgiveness (Table of mercy); 4. Covenant (renewal of bpatismal vows); 5. Nourishment (bread from Heaven); 6. Anticipation (declaration of hope); 7. Eucharist (joyous thanksgiving). <br /> <br />Reminds me alot of Peter Leithart's chapters in Blessed are the Hungry, but more tightly organized, less speculative, and more concise.  I disagree with Smith sometimes, but these are generally good.  He tries to stick with a Mere Christianity approach and is good at avoiding marking his theological boundaries or entering into the conflicts.  He has a way of stating each of these 7 aspects positively and biblically so that a Calvinist, Catholic and Zwinglian could all take something away from it. <br /> <br />A few examples of things I liked: <br />From part I: Discusses eating as spiritual practice; a meal  in which we celebrate the reign of God and communicate that we are a people who live in this reign. (p.9).  \\"Our social context encourages us to make our own choices, liveour own lives, and engage with others only when we think they have something to offer us.  This is not a Christian spirituality. (p.10-11).  I John 1:3-4 reminds us that joy is made complete when we are in fellowship with God and one another. <br /> <br />\\"As Alexander Schmemann [Orthodox] has observed, the origianl sin of Genesis 3 is not so much that Adam and Eve acted willfully but that they were no longer hungry for God and looking to God for 'life'  Their eating was a violation of life because they ate in disobedience but ALSO because they ignored God in their eating.\\" (p. 16). <br /> <br />Part II random notes: <br />p. 48 Richard Baxter (not as low sacramentology as other Puritans): \\"on where is God so near to man as in Jesus Christ, and NOWHERE IS CHRIST SO FAMILIARLY REPRESENTED TO US AS IN HIS HOLY SACRAMENT.\\"   <br /> <br />In the Nourishment chapter (pp.81ff.) Smith rightly gives Calvinists credit for emphasizing this aspect of the meal (bread of Heaven, means of grace).  But he also notes that it is a strong image in Wesley too (something to like about Wesley for a change).  He footnotes a paper by Leanne Van Dyke \\"Reformed Sacramental Theology\\" a 2002 paper given at AAR that I want to get ahold of that.  She is a conservative Barthian, a very good scholar, and Reformationally oriented.    <br /> <br />In the Anticipation he gives some more interetsing stuff on Schmemann.   \\"Schmemann...stresses that the L S is an event in space and time, in THIS space and time, in the here and now, in the uncertainities and discouragemnet of this time.  In other words, the LS is not an escape from our time or place.  ...On the contrary, this event is very much one in which we participate as those who are unavoidably in this world....when..we enter into thsi meal...we participate in what we HOPE for, the future renewal of creation....The LS cuts the cord of cynicism and defeatism.....\\" (p. 95). <br /> <br />George Herbert on p.114.	2005-08-09

Well trained -- MDiv at Princeton Seminary, MA at Princeton Univ., doctoral work under Harnack in Berlin, PhD under Speiser at Univ. of Penn.

Hart bio of Nevin coming out this fall (2005), that I decided to prep myself with Richard Wentz's 1997 bio from Oxford Univ. Press. <br /> <br />Well, I'd say it is unsatisfying, but its full of gems.  Nevin is SUCH a fascinating guy -- high ecclesiology, antipathy to revivalism and pietism, high sacramentology, Reformed theology, and ecumenicity.  He was an Old School Presbyterian before migrating to the German Reformed, and was the one who filled in for Hodge at Princeton in the 1820s when Hodge went to study in Europe two years.  Schaff is not nearly as interesting as Nevin, to me.   <br /> <br />Wentz seems less of an evangelical or confessionalist than Nevin (see p. 96). At one point he gushes that de Chardin and Tillich have shown us that understanding Christ as center does not require a commitment to Christianity as superior religion.  Wentz likes Nevin partly because he sees Christianity as 'not an ideology.'  He teaches religion at Arizona State (don't discount ASU, Heiko Oberman was there for years).  <br /> <br />Still: concise (just 147 pp.).  Lots of good historical narrative.  Unpreteniously, simple but smart writing style.  It will be difficult for anyone without a background in Reformed theology. <br /> <br />Some nuggets: pp. 76-77 -- Nevin's postmil sensibilities made him sure the Church would not be absorbed into the state but the state will 'vanish away into the Church.'  Got that one wrong. <br /> <br />Nevin's ministry had a strong hint of futility.  Nevin's brilliant, Biblical, ecumenical efforts  at liturgical renewal were met by either suspicion or yawns.  Wertz editorializes about the efforts of contemporary Nevins: \\"In the liturgical renewal movements of the mid-20th century that have affected the worship life of mainstream traditions such as Presbyterians, Methodists, and UCC, the people (laity) have maintained a stoical toleration  They have continued to look at liturgical matters as, at best, cornmentsthat preface the delivery of the sermon.\\" (p. 127).  And \\"what does the average American care about Te Deum, litany, lessons and collects, and creed?  Even if it be true, as Nevin assumed, that the people could possibly find themselves properly in these symbolic realities, they are not likely to be interestd in the  experiment.\\" (p. 134). <br /> <br />Nevin's work on the Heidleberg Catechism sounds fascinating.  I definitely plan on getting a copy of that.  His Mystical Presence, of course, is a classic. <br /> <br />Wentz does a great job of showing Nevin's strong case for the value of catechesis. <br /> <br />I was fascinated by Nevin's critique of nationalism.  Every bit as sophisticated as Hodge's (and Lincoln's).   <br /> <br />If Wertz's conclusion does not get you to buy either his book or the Hart one you have no soul: \\"The worship of American churches is found wanting because it gives no evidence of the sacramental character of the mystical presence of Christ.  It focuses instead on private experience, private judgment, and bibliocism.  The radical catholicity of the Incarnation is sacramental and liturgical......... the heart of that challenge [against American religious thought of his day] beats with concern for the community of faith, for the body that represents the presence of a new creation in the midst of the old.\\" (p. 147).	2005-08-08
US	52918265	R2BRL439X3GC26	0826417868	668805061	Pope Benedict XVI: A Biography of Joseph Ratzinger	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Very useful, if deeply flawed	Allen wrote this five years ago, but the publisher (Continuum) threw a new cover and title on it (\\"Pope Benedict XVI\\"). <br /> <br />Allen is CNN's Vatican analyst and the senior Vatican correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, a far left outfit (pro-gay ordination and marriage, pro-birth control, no loyalty oaths for Catholic clergy and teachers, clergy marriage, etc.). <br /> <br />Allen starts off gracious and even-handed.  But once past the pleasantries, he constructs a relentlessly negative attack on Ratzinger.  Everything is painted very black and white, with Ratzinger playing the role of Darth Vader.  Interestingly, Allen himself publicly repented of his unjust approach shortly after the book appeared, but the publisher would not allow him to make revisions or write a new preface (that costs money, and might not as neatly correspond to Continuum's view of the Universe, where people like Ratzinger suffocate puppies and cut down trees and hate women). <br /> <br />So Allen is writing a new bio., which is b supposed to be just as liberal, but a lot fairer to Ratzinger.    <br /> <br />There are a few challenges to pinning down Ratzinger's precise views.  For the last twenty-plus years Ratzinger has spoken as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, where he the coordinator of a large working group.    <br /> <br />A few tidbits: <br />* His parents were named Joseph and Mary. <br />* On the Hitler Youth thing: Allen makes much of the fact that Ratzinger's father did not joined any armed uprising against Hitler and get martyred, and that Ratzinger's scant memories of certain Hitler atrocities local to his Bavaria are improbable.  But clearly - Ratzinger's dad was very anti-Hitler.  Ratzinger (18 at the time the War ended) was drafted into the Hitler Youth late, and doesn't seem to have participated in meetings at all.    <br />* His favorite theologians: Augustine, Bonaventure, Guardini (quite liberal), von Balthazar (portrayed as right-wing, but essentially a Catholic Barthian).  Allen portrays Ratzinger's preference for Augustine to the detriment of Aquinas as a horror, because of Augustine's alleged grim view of human nature.  See pp. 3, 35-42. <br />* Ratzinger believes that the best antidote to political totalitarianism is ecclesial totalitarianism.  He believes the Catholic Church serves the cause of human freedom by restricting freedom in its internal life, thereby remaining clear about what it teaches and believes. (pp. 3ff.)  (Personal note - I think ecclesiastical totalitarianism, when we have approached it in history, is generally just as repressive and evil as its political counterpart, but sometimes I think it still should be the goal anyway.  I think an evil, repressive church may in some way be a burden we are called to endure in our cross-bearing.  The Christian [and OT] Church has always done more evil than good in the world, but it did this to our Savior too, and maybe its God's plan that we endure it to learn what it means to be in Christ.  Let's stop pretending, however, that the Church is good for the world - the Democrats, homosexuals, etc. are not hallucinating; we do hurt them and each other.  The Lion's Club does not treat their members, and outsiders, anywhere near as poorly as we often do.) <br />* Allen asserts that Ratzinger is politically conservative, but gives no evidence for it other than Ratz.'s social conservativism.  His former boss, Pope JPII, was socially conservative but fiscally liberal.  Pope JPII's anti-Communism was matched by equal anti-Capitalism.   <br />* Long section on his great-uncle Georg Ratz. - fierce critic of the `ultra-montanism' (strong papal authority) our Ratzinger now advocates, anti-Semite, excommunicated progressive, etc.  He was born 85 years before Joseph. <br />* Nice portrait of the four Bavarian towns in which Ratz. grew up.  Shocking the extreme government regimentation - couldn't do even minor work on your home without  a permit, could not fish, plant a garden etc.  \\"Such regimentation helps explain why most Germans after 1933 did not feel themselves to be living in a totalitarian state, as the level of government intrusion in their lives was not much different from the time before Hitler came to power.\\"  (p. 11). Shocking to hear such a political liberal admit this. <br />* Beautiful section on Ratz falling in love with the drama of the liturgy as a child (p. 13). <br />* Got from Guardini the conviction of the Church as `Mystical Body' (I thought that was Paul, I Cor. 12, no?).  Guardini saw it as a model navigating between two extremes: the Catholic Neo-Scholastic definition of the Church in purely institutional terms and the liberal Protestant Congregationalist understanding of the Church as social contract.  The Vatican II Young Turk progressives (that Ratzinger was a prominent part of) all embraced this model.  But they took it in two different directions.  More on that in a bit. <br />* Both Balthasar and Rahner agreed that the old two-story model of nature and grace, which saw grace as `added on' by God to nature, was insufficient.  Rahner saw God as the driving force inside all nature.  But Balthasar argued for an analogy of being in which human beings share a common ground with God but remain distinct.   <br />* Balthasar cautioned against the obsession with the historical Jesus, warning against becoming a Jesus-ian instead of a Christ-ian.   <br />* Balthasar's favorite theologian - Origen (yuck).  Ratz disagrees.   <br />* Back to Vatican II.  Allen notes that Ratz was among the young progressives there, along with Rahner, Congar, Kung, Schillebeeckx.  After getting his appointment at the University from the extraordinary efforts of his friend Kung (whom Ratz later prosecuted and had silenced!), Ratz made a turn to the right in the aftermath of some radical student protests in 1968-9.  These protests were blasphemous and Marxist, yet were supported by most Catholic clergy and faculty.   <br />* Allen argues that there were germs of his conservativism in his Vatican II and pre-1968/9 self.  At Vatican II there were two allied but distinct impulses of reform present.  The liberal `aggiornamento' was a drive to modernize the Church and conform it to cultural standards.  The conservative `ressourcement' was also progressive but it was a call to reform the Church by `returning to the sources' (Bible and Church Fathers).  (see p. 57).  It seems to me that these two impulses roughly correspond to our Protestant liberal and neo-orthodox trends of the 1920s-60s. Ratz was more ressourcement than aggiomento. <br />* In 1972 the split in the young progressive camp was formalized by Ratz, du Lubac, Walter Kasper, Karl Lehmann, and Balthasar's break from their fellow young Turks in founding Communio, a competing journal to the Concilium that Ratz helped found with Kung, Rahner, Metz, etc. (pp. 84, 91). <br />* Allen's crypto-animosity for Ratz peeks out for a second in the 2nd paragraph of p. 91 and other places where he assumes evil motives for Ratz's theology - that the change of heart is about his personal grab for power and not sincere theological development.   <br />* Ratz thinks rationalist Adolf von Harnack and existist. Bultmann are the two cornerstones of flawed modern Christology (read more p. 96). <br />* Ratz loves Augustine's quote \\"Inasmuch as anyone loves Christ's Church, to that degree he possesses the Holy Spirit.\\" (p.99).  I love that quote and have used it a lot too.  It is convicting.   <br />* \\"Ratz says a recovery of Platonic/Augustinian emphasis on individual salvation is a necessary corrective to the corporate and social eschatologies.  Here Ratz mentions liberation theology by name....\\" (p. 101). <br />* Ratz the teacher: reported that local German townsfolk would go top Ratz's early morning theology lectures at the university on their way to work.  He spoke as a priest first, and a prof. second. (p. 103). <br />* When Ratz switched universities his grad students would go with him.  In Germany loyalties are to the prof not the university. <br />* All Ratz's ex-buddies who he later persecuted on behalf of the Vatican-- turns out they are kind of jerks (though Allen minimizes this).  Rahner, for example, made no effort to reconcile with Ratz before his death in 1984;  Kung publicly (in print) compared Ratz and the Congregation to the Inquisition and the KGB (p. 126).   <br />* Kung traveled as far left after Vatican II as Ratz traveled right.  Somehow Allen thinks Ratz's drift right is inexcusable, but Kung's equal drift left is a sign of his intellectual growth and honesty. <br />* Ratz \\"The Christian believer is a simple person: bishops should protect the faith of these little people against the power of intellectuals.\\" (p. 130).  YES. <br />* In the late 60s arch-liberationist heretic Leonardo Boff was aided by Ratz, who helped him get his first publisher. (p. 138). <br />* Great, concise critique of Gutierrez and liberation theology in general by Ratz in 1983, p. 153.  As good as Ronald Nash, in two paragraphs. <br />* Notre Dame comes off as way to the left of Ratz, which surprised me. <br />* The section on studies of gay clergy pp. 198ff. is SHOCKING.  The frankness with which some of the gay priests troll for sex partners is staggering.  We all know 20-40% of Catholic clergy have gay inclinations, but the descriptions of their acting on that is tragic. <br />* According to quotes Allen provides, Ratz. Believes that people of other faiths can be saved on the basis of their good works pleasing God.  (p. 218, for example).  Allen, of course, does not think Ratz goes far enough on this. <br />* Allen consistently paints Ratz as more conservative than Pope JPII.   <br />* Ratz think Neo-Scholasticism that has dominated the Catholic Church lends itself to a too Western view of the world, and that we need more Eastern (Orthodox) influences. (p.226). <br />* Protestant ecumenism?  The CatholicChurch, of course, says Protestants are separated brethren.  But when a Protestant wishes to become Catholic he must be re-baptized, and clergy must be re-ordained (meaning our sacraments and ordinances are invalid), though the reverse is not true where Catholics become, say Presbyterian.  Leo XIII said Anglican ordination is `absolutely null and utterly void.\\"  Anyway, Ratz has read lots of Luther (p. 231) and is friends with Lutheran Pannenberg,  When asked about the prospects for unity with the Lutheran Church he said \\"As soon as there is A Lutheran church, we can discuss it.\\"   <br />* Long before the Passion film, Ratz wisely said to Jews \\"all sinners (not just Jews) are the authors of Christ's passion.\\" (p. 250).  I'd go further and as a Calvinist say `all believers who have sinned are the only ones who sent him to the Cross.\\"  Further, he reminds Jews (who unlike Christians have no doctrine of forgiving the unrepentant), that \\"Jesus blood raises no calls for retaliation but calls all to reconciliation.\\"   <br />* Ratz believes Christianity fulfills Judaism (p. 250).  He raised controversy by saying, on the eve of a major Jewish-Catholic dialogue meeting in 1987, that Jews could be fully true to their heritage only by becoming Christian (p. 251).  The meeting was canceled in protest. <br />* Pope JPII said to a meeting of Muslims \\"Your god and ours is the same.\\" (p.252).  But Ratz warns that Muslims see the Christian West as very weak, and that at its core Islam is undemocratic.  The implication: Islam then will use democracy in the West to gain power, but once in power will abandon democracy.   <br />* Allen think Ratz's stance can be summarized by an obsession with Rom. 12:2 \\"not being conformed to the spirit of this age.\\"  (p. 262). <br />* Ratz doesn't like Kant's numenal / phenomenal distinction (p. 263). <br />* Sometimes Allen's facts seem questionable.  Was it 163 theologians (p. 282), or 130 (p. 283) who signed the protest against the Pope in 1989? <br />* The Matthew Fox case shows how radically at odds Allen's vision for the Church is with Ratz's.  Allen celebrates Fox's New Age heresy as fresh investigation.  (pp. 287ff.).  Fox, of course, proves part of Ratz's point about him when in 1992 he publicly protests the Vatican's decision on him in a schismatic fashion.  Allen misses the irony of these protests (Kung, Rahner, etc.) every time.  Its somehow OK for theologians and priests to publicly attack their church, its bishops, its popes, but its not OK for those popes to render sober judgments against these rebels.  Then again, this is the spirit of the age: people in the church don't see much wrong with a parishioner writing a libelous letter about the session or pastor and circulizing it to everyone, but they are shocked and want explanations when a session disciplines a wayward parishioner.  I don't get it.  Radical democracy?  Class wars?   <br />* Ratz thinks in `centuries.\\"  He's not worried sp much about winning today's battles, as he is being faithful to the unchanging deposit of faith and setting the church on the right trajectory for the future. (p. 293). <br />* Next conclave: now in the past.  Publisher should have cut this chapter if they were going to re-title it for his ascension to the throne of Peter.

His writing style is clear and compelling. <br /> <br />Cohn tells of becoming a rabbi in his native Hungary in the 1880s.  His readings in the Talmud drive him to a growing interest in the Messiah.  This drives him to leave his wife and children behind for a trip to New York City.  There he comes to believe that Jesus was the hoped for Messiah.  He comes under intense persecution, and ends up at (Presbyterian) New College in Edinburgh, Scotland, reunited with his family.  He wife comes to share his convictions and leaves a happy life in Scotland to begin a mission to Jews in Brooklyn (Williamsburg and Brownsville), supported by Baptist churches and some other Jewish believers in Yeshua.  This grew into Chosen People Ministries in 1894. <br /> <br />The book is nicely packaged.  It also features a solid modern bibliography of Jewish and Jewish-Christian writings.	2005-08-01

(They are featured on pg. 6)  I phoned her and had a wonderful conversation.    She had written this book three years earlier.  She has some wonderful experiences, and reports them with untethered opinion and vigor.  But her style -- weighed down by cliches -- fast becomes wearisome.   Maybe we should give her a break --- she was 99 when she wrote this.    There is lots of interest here -- turn of the century Russian, secular Jewish life in Manhattan, early Hollywood, left-wing politics (McCarthy wasn't being paranoid about all the communists within the gates).	2005-07-03

Overall, whatever you think of the ideology of the authors, they know what they are talking about.  Peter Jones has a Princeton Ph.D., Garlow's is from Drew.

Another appeal, for me, is that it deals with teh broader cultural issues (Gnostic world-view) as well as just the details of the Da Vinci Code. <br /> <br />I also appreciated Ben Witherington's book on the topic, and D.

Its one of those highly anecdotal, tart, opinionated, under-footnoted, rambling British style histories, like Owen Chadwick's Secularization of the European Mind, or Peter Brown on Augustine, or one of Thomas Cahill's popular books.  I'm sure Johnson is way off at points (I don't know enough to know where).  And he is way to sympathetic to his subject to be balanced.  He's a neo-con politically, spending the early '80s with the American Enterprise Institute, hanging out with Zionist Jews like Irving Kristol.   <br /> <br />So, for example, even though Johnson is a professing Christian (Catholic I think I heard?) he always minimizes every single conversion of a Jew to Christianity as an insincere move for self-protection.  So he treats Disraeli's baptism cynically, and never mentions his deep, life-long commitment to Christianity.  Same for Mendelsohm and others. <br /> <br />But, overall, VERY readable.  Extremely interesting.  The constant emphasis on anti-Semitism is very sobbering.	2005-07-01

Each treatment is rather brief, but he packs good insights in most every time.  This is classic Stott -- theologically rich, practically oriented, concise, clearly written. This is a must have for any study of teh Psalms.  It often has been my favorite work on certain psalms.   I use Derek Kidner (Tyndale set) for dependable reference.  Boice is often very helpful though uneven and sometimes irrelevent (a tad less Christocentric than you'd hope); James Mays (Interpretation series) is wordy and often too critical of the text, but often original; CS. Lewis -- spotty but often wonderful; Joseph Addison Alexander -- long, dry, dated, but very learned and theological; Eugene Peterson's Answering God -- nota  commentary, but wonderful inisghts.

He has really mastered his material, understands the broader context and writes in a very clear and concise style.<br /><br />This is a critical engagement with Dabney, that tries very hard not to judge him unfairly by 21st century standards.  Still it had the effect of diminishing my appreciation for Dabney.<br /><br />While I share alot of his basic theological values (commitment to Reformed orthodoxy, Westminster-style, etc.), I concluded that Dabney does not have a ton of abiding significance for me as a pastor. As I've observed from his systematic theology text, Dabney really has little distinctive to offer that can't be found in stronger form elsewhere (Hodge, Warfield, John Frame, etc.)<br /><br />What Dabney does offer is a window into an era of Southern conservative Presbyterianism.  Even on that score you can find smarter proponents (Thornwell) and more sensible ones (Moses Hoge; Walter Moore; Adgar), so why bother with Dabney?<br /><br />Some things I learned: 1. He was intensely provincial.  Only left the South (if you include TX) 3 times in his whole life -- twice to go to NY for Presbyterian business before the War and once for a short visit to Europe in his dottage.  Compare that to a guy like Hodge -- 20 years older but spent 2 years of study in Europe, traveled around the country, had good friends all over the world.<br />2. Dabney's racism was not just typical of the South, it was worse than average.  When his own PCUS denomination, at the peak of their pain in 1866, decided to move forward with ordaining black men, Dabney published a heated jeremiad against it.  See pp. 145-6.  He says that he finds it horrible that his collegues would extend love to blacks, as \\"I, for one, make no professions of special love for those who are, even now, attempting against me and mine the most loathsome outrages.......... to teach and rule over white ppeople, and make (a black man) a co-equal member with myself in West Hanover Presbytery, to sit in judgment on the affairs of white churches..I oppose........(blacks are) a subservient race..made to follow and not to lead...\\"<br />3.  He argued in writing that a major reason the South was poorer than the North was because they spent all their money on taking care of their slaves!<br />4. His angry campaign against Union Sem.'s move is comical and sad.<br /><br />I won't be reading any more Dabney.  I will read more Sean Lucas.black man) a co-equal member with myself in West Hanover Presbytery, to sit in judgment on the affairs of white churches..I oppose........(blacks are) a subservient race..made to follow and not to lead...\\"  3.

Olson had a reputation as a progressive and ecletic but basically orthodox evangelical theologian.  And not too many of those sort of folks have written a summary history of doctrine lately.  I was very disappointed.      On the good side:   1. nice binding and dustjacket by IVP  2. Lengthy  3. Simple, accessible writing style suitable for laypersons and college freshmen.  4. Sometimes insightful    On the bad side: profoundly imbalanced and unfair to the folks he doesn't like (Reformed, conservatives, Early Church Fathers, etc.)    A few example:   * His treatment of Old Princeton is as superficial as I have ever seen.  * He treats the Early Church Fathers as almost uniformly legalistic.  * He is petty and critical of Edwards, but gives Wesley a free pass.  Not surprising if you read Olson's bizarre letter to the editor of US News and World Report about 2004 regarding what a vicious tyrant Edwards was.  * His sympathy for Open Theism is obvious everywhere.  * He almost calls Athanaius an Apollinarian heretic  * He clearly prefers live heresy to dead orthodoxy  * On one page he calls Arminius a Reformed theologian, and on the next says he is not.    We can go on and on.  Simply put -- this book is a total trainwreck and not worth spending any time with at all.    Save your money and buy Pelikan.  Or better yet --  the new Christopher Hill text.	2005-06-11

Would make a great book to study at an officers' retreat, a small group study, and a host of other contexts.  The author is a PCUSA pastor of a 1200-member church in CA, with a PhD, and a pretty orthodox evangelical.  Calvin is the author most often cited by far, but he quotes a wide range of folks (mostly very familiar): Nouwen, Brunner, Barth, Rahner, Berkouwer, Bloesch, Moltmann, Cuillmann,  NT Wright, Lloyd-Jones, Warfield, Hodge, Ellen Charry, CS Lewis, etc.    If we take the Apostles' Creed as a summary of the Gospel, then belief in communion of the saints is as important as the Trinity.  If that's true, the Church is awash with more heresy than any other time in its history.    His focus is 1. the Trinity 2. Communion of the Saints. It is very irenic for a jeremiad.  Decent index and end notes, bt no SCRIPTURE index.    A few representative quotes from the Intro.:  \\"I want to point the conversation about the soul in a more CHURCHLY direction\\"    \\"There is a crucial difference between a crowd and a community.\\"     \\"There is an enduring difference, of course, between a COLLECTIVE of individual Christians and a COMMUNITY.\\"    Emil Brunner: \\"togetherness of Christians is not...secondary or contingent: it is integral to their life just as is abiding in Christ.\\"	2005-05-26

Yet his identity is elastic. There is no single Jesus, in America or anywhere else,\\" he writes.  <br /> <br />This isn't the best church history I've read.  In fact it took me awhile to fall in love with it.  His humility and lack of stuffinss kept me reading.  But about a third of the way through he got me.  It is an impressionist work , so I'll give it a similarly disjointed, impresisonistic review.  Some random highlights for me: <br /> <br />p. 129: his take on Edwards joy in doing theology is better phrased than anything Marsden, Gerstner, I. Murray, Lee, McDermott or anybody else I've ever read on Edwards.  Its only a few paragraphs but it lit me up for hours. <br /> <br />p. 263: His thing on Hodge on Bushnell has been said before in bits and pieces by others.  But never so clearly and potently in such a short space.  I finally get it. For years I hated Bushnell (for reducing the faith to a socializing process); then when I finally began to shake off my revivalism I started to think I shouldn't have been so harsh on him.  Fox straightened me out in two paragraphs via Hodge. <br /> <br />p. 274: his sutble disdain for Henry Ward Beecher is wonderful.    <br /> <br />p. 358 -- his thing on Niebuhr's appreciation for Edwards -- great. <br /> <br />p. 396 -- \\"evangelical Protestants like to ask 'What WOULD Jesus do?,' but many Catholics and non-evangelical Protestants prefer to ask \\"What DOES Jesus do?' \\" <br /> <br />p. 397 \\"Machen was naive, (Niebuhr) thought, to attack liberalism without also taking on the popular revivalists who did as much to undermine a proper respect for the supernatural as the liberals did.  Revivalists too were reducing the Gospel to a self-help creed, an empowerment doctrine adorned in pious trappings....\\"   <br /> <br />I could go on like this.  This is a rather awful book if its the only American chucrh history you will read in a year or two.  But read critically it has a few dozen moments that will make it wwll worth it.	2005-04-16

The study questions at the end of each chapter, and teh non-techical approach make this idea for small group discussion or a c.e. class. <br /> <br />Overall, this would be my first choice.  For those who want more words and a slightly more pugnacious approach, also get Michale Horton We Believe.  For a GREAT intro., and some other good insights, by a Catholic scholar who is less orthodox than McGrath -- Luke Timothy Johnson's new The Creed (2003) is a good second choice.  For a variety of moderately liberal and neo-orthodox perspectives, and a mix of theological and sermonic materials, check out the new Van Harn, ed., Exploring and Proclaiming The Apostles' Creed (2004).

Luke Timothy Johnson is a moderately conservative neo-orthodox Roman Catholic.  A world-class Biblcial scholar teaching at (liberal Methodist) Emory.      There are some VERY outstanding new books on the Creed: Alister McGrath's I Believe; Van Harn, ed., Exploring and Proclaiming The Apostles' Creed [2004]; Michael Horton, We Believe, and the last section of David Matzko McCarthy, The Good Life [2004].  If I bought just two, one would be Johnson's.  McGrath and Horton's works are certainly more orthodox in spots. (For example, 'born of the Virgin Mary': Horton and McGrath believe that the Creed is right on that, while Johnson strongly hedges.)  But Johnson makes up for shaky orthodoxy in style, precision, and clarity.      His introduction is the best part of the book.  His defense of creeds, against Modernity on one hand and Anabaptists on the other, is alone worth the $10.  Pleasant cover and packaging too.	2005-02-20

This one is anthology by a variety of pretty notable neo-orthodox types, mostly from the mainline Reformed camp.  Some are less orthodox than I might like, but almost every essay in here is insightful and provactive.      Each  of 15 articles of the Creed is given a theological essay by one author and a sermon by another.  Among the most notable contributors are: Colin Gunton; Neil Plantinga (CRC evangelical); Ralph Wood (Barthian Baptist); James Kay and George Hunsunger(Barthian Princetonian Presbyterians); Daniel Migliore (Princetonian, more liberal than Kay or Hunsinger); Richard Hays (neo-orothodox, Duke); Fleming Rutledge (neo-orthodox Episcopal priestess).  Several others (Tom Long, Cynthia Rigby etc.) BTW have Princeton connections.    While somewhat uneven theologically, this is a must read for the preacher or serious student of the Creed.  Probably my third choice after McGrath and Johnson.	2005-02-20

For example, he perceives his pilgrimmage to the Episcopal church as part of a larger, growing trend among evangelicals going back to (liberal) mainline denominations (p.11).  He must regret that prediction!!<br /><br />Still the book is a good topic, very readble, and makes some decent points.<br /><br />174pp.  Its divided into two parts.  First part Webber explains how the Anglican tradition met six important needs: 1. a sense of mystery ; 2. Christ-centered worship; 3. sacramental reality; 4. historical identity; 5. feeling of being a part of Christ's entire church; 6. holistic spirituality.<br /><br />Part 2 consists of six short testimonies of evangelcials who went Anglican (David Neff of CT, etc.)<br /><br />Lots of good stuff in there.  I sympathize with all six of his concerns.  But a few negatives:<br />1.  In his attempts to re-assure his unconvinced readers he shows a view of tradition that is pretty Anabaptist.  For example, he does this whole thing about truth being an artichoke.  The kernel is the 'primitive Gospel' and traditions (all historic accidents) are the leaves around it (pp.14f.).  It comes off as Campbellite.<br />2. He does not make a convincing case for why a move to Anglicanism is necessary or even desirable.  At best he shows how Anglicanism 'tends towards' certain benefits that can nevertheless be found in other traditions (like Presbyterianism).  So is the trade-off (with all the draw backs to Anglicanism) worth it for a Presbyterian or Methodist who wants more liturgy, more catholicity, more historic connections etc.?  Not if Webber's case is the final word.	2005-02-04

Don't let the Fuller connection (or the blurp from Roger Olson - uptight postevangelical) scare you off. Karkkainen's own view point may seem less orthodox than many would like (including this reader), <br />but this is a WONDERFUL survey of all the streams of thought throughout <br />Church history and across the globe.  I really wish I had this when I was in <br />the intro. courses at seminary.  It is INCREDIBLY ACCESSIBLE and lucid.

Its stunning how <br />good this guy is at summarizing ideas and contrasting them with others.  It <br />is very irenic too. <br /> <br />Karkkainen is comfortable in his own skin and just unapologetically revels in his ecumenical neo-orthodoxy. <br /> <br />A great read for those secure and mature in their own theology and not looking to adopt Karkkainen's views, but to use him to understand other positions. <br /> <br />See the review preceding this one for a list of topics covered.	2004-12-10

Urbanski makes a good effort at portraying this, and generally succeeds.  It is lovingly written and organized (if somewhatly shallow at times).  Don't look for much critical engagemnet -- this is pure hagiography.  I really should subtract one star for publishing  this with \\"Relevent Books.\\" What a STUPID name!

When teh dust jacket tears, the hardcover beneath it is identical.  Attractive, readable font. <br /> <br />SCOPE AND FORMAT: The first few hundred pages cover all the basic topics concisely: naming traditions, migration history, rabbinical genealogy, immigration records, American vital records, overseas records, etc.  Very few topics are missed (I would have liked to have seen more on photos and family hierlooms).   <br /> <br />The majority of this massive book, however, is an alphabetical treatment of the specific issues of research in various country -- everything from Norway, with a handful of Jews, up to the major spots like Russia, Poland, and the Ukraine.  Each country gets about 1-8 pages. <br /> <br />Therefore, if your known Jewish ancestors are from just 2 or 3 countries, as is the case for most, then 95 percent of the last 400 pages of the book will be irrelevant to you. <br /> <br />My biggest complaint: NO INDEX!  But the chapters are short and well-organized, making it easy to navigate.  GREAT bibliographies at the ends of each chapter suggest trails of further research. <br /> <br />QUALITY: VERY high.  The contributors are all masters of their topics.  The writing style, for the most part, is clear and lively.  The essays are written to be assible for beginners, but also contain plenty of helpful material for even the most experienced genealogist.   <br /> <br />The articles are pretty current.  Most seem to have been written in 2003. <br /> <br />My advice -- please get this book.  Its a joy.  If purchased along with Barbara Krasner-Khait 's Discovering Your Jewish Ancestors (2001) its all you need for general handbooks.  (Krasner-Kahait covers other topics like heirlooms and photos in more depth and takes a more anecdotal, case-study approach, which complements and illustrates this Avotaynu nicely). <br /> <br />Added bonus -- we really need to support Avotaynu.  They are doing such important work.  Consider buying a copy for your public library too.  And subscribe to the excellent Avotaynu journal. <br /> <br />	2004-11-14

Many have held the brain responsible for some bad behavior: \\"My disease did it!\\" (p. 13).  While the observations of the rapidly expanding field of brain sciences can be very helpful, when interpreted through a biblical lens they can be put in a more modest and helpful perspective.  How do these discoveries illustrate biblical truths that can be applied to people's lives?  Instead, too often sin problems are mislabeled as solely brain problems, and thus the true cause is left unaddressed (p. 25). <br /> <br />Four very practical principles emerge from this approach to mind-body issues: 1. The brain cannot by itself `make' a person sin (pp.49f.).  2. Each person's abilities (brain strengths and weaknesses) are unique (pp.53f.).  3.  Brain problems can expose heart problems (pp.56f.).  4. Sinful hearts can lead to physical illness; upright hearts can contribute to good health (pp.58f.).  <br /> <br />In part two of the book these principles are then concisely but thoughtfully applied to a series of examples.  First are apparently physical issues: Alzheimer's disease (pp. 67f.) and head injury (pp.85f.).  Next are more psychiatric issues: depression (pp.115f.), \\"A.D.D.\\" (pp. 131f.), homosexuality (pp.151f.), and alcoholism (pp. 183f.). <br /> <br />Welch's treatments of these problems abound with practical, sensitive insight.  In the process he clearly defines the deeper issues at stake: what is the soul?; what is the body?; what is sin? <br /> <br />For me, a crucial component of the book is the section on the mind-body relationships, especially pp. 43-48.   Welch is careful to distinguish the heart from the body, but without separating them.  Drawing upon rich Trinitarian analogies, he is careful to outline a model that seeks not to over-emphasize either the duality or the unity.  This understanding enables us to try to distinguish between sin and sickness.  As Welch ably define sit: \\"any behavior that does not conform to biblical commands or any behavior that transgresses biblical prohibitions proceeds form the heart and is sin\\" (p. 43).  Conversely, \\"any behavior that is more accurately called a weakness proceeds form the body and is sickness or suffering\\" (p. 44).  We are to repent of sin.  But things that reflect only our creaturely limitations are not immoral, but proceed from our fallen bodies. <br /> <br />The example Welch uses of hallucinations is illustrative.  The Bible does not prohibit them, so we can not admonish someone for experiencing them.  We are called to compassion for them.  The hallucination may have been caused by a prior sinful choice, and the hallucinatory may respond to them with sin, but the hallucination itself is not sinful.  A helpful chart on p. 45 lists out some examples of body problems (broken bones, mental retardation, feelings of depression, hallucinations) and heart (mind) problems (anger, pride, drunkenness).  Of course, many problems involve both the body and the heart or mind, and in unequal and obscured proportions.  How do we separate out the differences?  And why is it helpful to try? <br /> <br />Each summer during high school and college I worked in a nursing home.  The changes I witnessed in particular residents after being away from them for almost a year were often shocking and tragic.  I think of a seemingly kind and affable man named D., who in a few months seemed to transform into an unrecognizably profane and lewd bore.  Welch demonstrates convincingly that such brain or body problems as D.'s Alzheimer's can expose what is in the heart.  The brain appears to have led the person into bad behavior, when it is more accurate to say that the brain problem allowed certain otherwise hidden parts of their heart to be uncovered.  Welch contends, \\"In some case brain problems function like truth serum for the heart\\" (p. 58). <br /> <br />Welch's treatment of the subject is fairly comprehensive but far from exhaustive.  Questions of application remain.  If meds can only, at their best, address the body issues and not the heart, how do we know which needs addressing?  Welch addresses this in a wise, but frustratingly brief section in pp. 125-127.  Adopting Welch's guidelines is easy enough, but applying them to real life situations, I know from experience, is another matter.  What about the person who meets some but not all of the criteria listed on p. 127 (they are over forty; have had no prior history of problems with depression; are taking prescription drugs, etc.)?   This is not a flaw in Welch's treatment of the topic, just a limitation of its brief explication here. <br /> <br />I have known a person, for example, who had his first bout with depression at age 62.  But it was extremely serious.  He became despondent and delusional and was checked into a residential treatment facility.  His case meets the first of the two criteria listed by Welch, but not the last two.  Clearly, his depression was triggered by some circumstances in his life (some the direct result of some horrible choices, others not).  Yet, just as clearly it seems that the depression, while largely originating from his sinful behavior, now had a physical component.  His medications, while wrought with multiple serious side effects, did seem to successfully contribute to his ability to function.  Yet, if I were given a decision making role in his `treatment,' I would want to somehow know: were the drugs really helpful, or was it their placebo effect?  And if they did reduce his anxiety, is that all necessarily good?  Did he not need discomfort to drive him to make changes in his absolutely horrendous behavior?  And if so, how much and what type of discomfort?   <br /> <br />Anyway, Welch's book wrestles with some deep issues and presents them in a lucid and readable format. <br />	2004-11-04

It takes an uncommonly Biblical approach, leading one through a process designed to foster reconciliation, to God's glory.  One is instructed in ways to \\"get the log out of your eye\\"; to \\"go and show your brother his faults,\\" and to \\"go and be reconciled.\\"  These principles are applied to a variety of situations: third-party conciliation, forgiveness, confession, church discipline, self-examination, conflict assessment, and more. <br /> <br />Sande continually reminds his readers that conflict is a great opportunity to see the Gospel lived out in radical ways.  By this God is glorified in ways the world cannot explain.  This must be the focus of all peacemaking: \\"whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God\\" (I Cor. 10:31). <br /> <br />While Sande provides an abundance of practical techniques for implementing his understanding of Biblical principle of peacemaking, these by themselves cannot accomplish what is needed.  The methods only provide opportunities for reconciliation, but true reconciliation is always a heart issue.  In the end, all of Sande's steps and procedures must happen through faith alone in Christ alone.  Apart from him we can do nothing (John 15:5).  And simply going through the motions, however precisely, cannot serve as a substitute for the work of the Holy Spirit, who alone can apply Christ's work of reconciliation to us.  Conflict may cease on the surface, and hostilities can be contained or sublimated, but true reconciliation cannot happen apart from the Holy Spirit giving the parties a growing experience of what Christ has done to reconcile us to the Father (2 Cor. 5:18-20). <br /> <br />Since teaching the Peacemaker c.e. series in 2000, I have seen these concepts at work in the life of our church family.  I stock extra copies of the \\"Peacemaker Pledge\\" pamphlet on our fellowship table on Sundays and in my office.  I have been amazed at how this tool can often humble people and redirect the focus of their concerns from their own agenda to God's glory.    <br /> <br />But I have also seen the Peacemaker materials misused.  People can go through the steps of Sande's book explicitly and methodically, but the focus can be misdirected from God's glory to the person's own hurt.  If one starts from a self-righteous place it can poison all the steps of Sande's book.    <br /> <br />This is a reminder that we cannot engineer what we desire, but are completely dependant on the Lord's grace for true reconciliation.  The only One capable of real peacemaking is \\"the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep\\" (Heb. 13:20).  <br />	2004-11-04

A Journey Back from Brain Injury	Books	4	9	14	N	Y	Moving, thoughtful, if unsatisfying personal account	Where is the Mango Princess? is a truly touching but tragic account of Traumatic Brian Injury (TBI) and its impact on a family.  As much as I respect Anne Lamont, I wonder at her comment, at least as it appears on the book cover blurb, that this is a story of `recovery.'  What exactly has been recovered?  And how redemptive has this been in the lives of Cathy Crimmins and her husband Alan?  Surely Cathy has had to address her once `hands-off' approach to marriage and has chosen to become a truly sacrificial wife, in the process shedding much of the enlightened independence she had so highly prized.  In this way, she has somehow backed into a richer `covenantal' attitude to her husband (reflected in the traditional vows she, no doubt, took).  She is living much more for him, even when he does not appreciate it, realize it, or have as much to offer in return.  The picture is sad but beautiful, and highly instructive.  Her world is a far more blessed place as a result of her response to this tragedy.    And yet, has she `recovered?'  What exactly did she `lose' and what does she have back now?  Her `wellness?'  Her `humanity?'  Maybe it is his that is recovered?  I am not sure.  Because her beautiful story remains largely fruitless for her life.  After much struggle, she has learned to `cope.'  Her story, filled with potential power, is ultimately a lovely tragedy.    This is instructive to anyone who might seek to care for someone who has suffered TBI and to their family.  I have ministered to a few, and wish I had read in advance the Mango Princess (particularly through the lens of chapter 5 of Edward Welch's Blame it on the Brain).  I think of one person in particular.  Looking back I realize neither he nor I coped with the results of his injury adequately.   I did not really understand the ways his injury legitimately impacted her, because it was clear that he was being so willfully selfish and hurtful.  And he in turn wanted to blame his sin completely on his injury.  The big issue I wish I had seen better in the past: his TBI did create some very significant hidden weaknesses that needed to be recognized and accounted for in trying to help his deal with his struggles.    Families in these circumstances face special heart obstacles, as Crimmins so thoughtfully illustrates.  Like Alan, the victims very often heal outwardly in a short time, causing the families frustration at not seeing a similar recovery in their mental, emotional and behavioral issues.  He is walking again; he is talking again; his wound is healed up; he looks all better; so why can't he start acting more like he used to?  He's not a vegetable, and he can seem like his `old self' sometimes, so why does he have to acts so impulsive or socially inappropriate?  Why is his sense of humor so `weird?' Why doesn't he respond to things the way we used to (reasoning, prayer)?  And if so, why can't they just do some surgery or give him a pill that will `fix' him?    The real physical impact of the injury needs to be understood if the mundane duties of living are to be carried forward, and if the heart of the person and his family and friends are to be challenged to greater spiritual maturity.  Perhaps the hardest thing to grapple with (something Crimmins seems to miss) is the truth that the best explanation of post-injury behavior is pre-injury character (See Ed Welch, p. 90).  Welch suggests the difficult but potentially liberating truth that the injury can act as `truth serum' to its victims.  It can be deeply discouraging, but it also can be redemptively potent as people gain more open access to what was truly in the person's heart all along.    TBI calls for special care and love.  A superficial attitude by loved ones can unwittingly contribute to the complex problems.       Crimmins provides a very thoughtful, sensitive, moving (if somewhat unsatisfying) account of her own deep experience.	2004-11-04
US	52918265	REP0RP66SE8UU	0140266712	567673846	Listening to Prozac: The Landmark Book About Antidepressants and the Remaking of the Self, Revised Edition	Books	3	16	37	N	Y	Raises some great questions	In exploring the role of experience on mood, in chapter five Kramer turns to various observations on \\"rapid-cycling.\\"   Certain people have been observed to swing back and forth between dark depression and wild euphoria in a matter of hours, seemingly with very small (or no) external provocations (pp.108-109).      Kramer applies three models, which he sees are interconnecting, to this issue.  First, Kramer summarizes the finding of Robert Post and his \\"kindling model.\\"  Post's work concluded that rapid-cycling was often the end stage of a long-term recurring problem.  \\"The general pattern was a decrease in the interval between episodes and an increase in the severity and complexity of the episodes, until finally rapid cycling set in\\" (p.109).  As time passes, Post's studies seem to indicate, ever smaller stimuli are needed to provoke ever severe episodes.  While many biological processes operate in the opposite way, requiring ever greater amounts of stimulus (street drugs, etc.), others (epilepsy; bipolar conditions, etc.) are \\"kindled.\\"  Interestingly, two seemingly unrelated conditions that are \\"kindled\\" seemed to respond positively to the same medications (pp. 112f.).      The second model Kramer discusses here is that suggested by stress research in rats (pp.116-118).  The rat studies \\"impl(y) that a variety of psychosocial stressors can serve as triggers\\" for the biologically encoded factors \\"kindled\\" in depression (p. 122).    The third model examined in chapter five is the monkey-separation studies (pp.118-122).   Rhesus monkeys seem especially helpful in reflecting on human problems due to similarities between the species  (p.118).   Kramer concludes from these studies that in the early stages of stress-induced kindling subjects will appear very normal, except that they will have a somewhat heightened sensitivity to loss (p. 122).    Kramer concludes that pain brings scars, even when it does not seem to immediately result in depression (p. 123).  He explains, \\"What distinguishes this view of depression from, say, traditional psychoanalytic models is the recognition that the scars are not, or not only, in cognitive memory.  It is not merely a question of inner conflict or of `growing up': `Stop fussing over what your parents did to you!' as skeptics command patients in therapy.  The scar consists of changed anatomy and chemistry within the brain (emphasis added)\\" (p. 123).  Kramer notes the implications of his neurobiological conclusions: \\"It seems that the neural pathways are like the joints in the musculoskeletal system.  They are worn down over the years by inevitable trauma... Age alone seems a trauma... if we live long enough we will all become depressed\\" (p. 135).       The point of this is that Kramer believes that Prozac can have a key role in the treatment of relatively `minor depressive illness' (p. 126).  If diagnosed early enough, Prozac and SSRIs \\"can help prevent the progression of early mood disorder into florid illness\\" (p. 127).    I found the thoughtful commentary of this chapter five fascinating and not a little alarming.  Could Kramer be correct that neural pathways significantly impact mood and that they may have been irreversibly worn down through stress, leaving one more susceptible to depression now?    I do not know what to conclude about this.  There are many who dispute this view of neurobiology.  But even if Kramer is partly correct in these conclusions, the Bible offers a far richer potential interpretation of this information than Kramer's naturalistic worldview.   As Ed Welch points out in Blame it on the Brain (1998), the the body is the mediator of moral action, not the initiator.  It is the `equipment of the heart' (p. 40).  Bad thoughts and actions, in response to the temptations presented by stressful circumstances, can impact the body.  Perhaps my failures to deal with trauma help cause the depression I suffer, and this depression may have permanent physiological effects.  The returning feelings of depression that I now wrestle with may be, as Welch contends, `body' rather than `heart' problems (Welch, p. 45), but my response to those feelings is still a spiritual issue not a brain issue.  Prozac, or any other treatment that seeks to address the brain alone, can not hope to get at the critical heart issues involved in depression.	2004-11-04

While both are fundamentally in agreement with Petty's basic approach, reading Step by Step has helped me organize their thoughts (and mine) in helpful categories, and further distinguish them from alternative approaches.<br /><br />As Petty ably illustrates, the stakes are high in this venture.  As we seek God's guidance, we are indeed more like `pilots in flight' than students in a library! (p. 18).  Especially helpful were Petty's explanation of the `three views.'  What Petty (somewhat disappointing) labels the Traditional View is certainly the most popular today among evangelicals (pp. 29-31).  It holds that guidance from God involves discovering the specifics of God's particular plan for our lives through various combinations of \\"circumstances, spiritual promptings, inner voices, personal peace of mind, and the counsel of others\\" (p. 30).  Guidance occurs when God reveals his plan through these means (p. 31).<br /><br />Petty next distinguishes the Traditional Charismatic view (pp. 32-33).  The key difference between this view and the one preceding it in Petty's summary is that in the Charismatic view God communicates directly.  Essentially, \\"each means of revelation that God used to give us the Scriptures is still available to individual Christians today\\" (p. 33), often with a new twist.<br /><br />The third view, the Wisdom view, is the one endorsed by Petty (pp.33-35).  This approach contends that while God does have a specific plan for each Christian, this plan remains hidden.  God generally does not lift the veil.  Instead, \\"guidance comes... by God making us wise.... The wisdom view sees God as guiding his children mediately, not immediately....his guidance is mediated by (comes through) the illumination of our minds and hearts by the Word of God\\" (p. 34).<br /><br />Petty favors and unpacks the Wisdom view in relation to four topics: 1. the doctrine of providence, 2. the sufficiency of Scripture, 3. the doctrine of illumination, 4. the current work of the Holy Spirit (p. 35).  Applying each of these criteria, it is clear that the Wisdom view in broad outline is more Biblically faithful than the proposed alternatives.<br /><br />The first three parts of the book (pp. 17-192) explore the theology of guidance.  The fourth part (pp. 193-262) consists of a helpful case study, illustrating ways this model can be practically applied to our lives.  The reader is invited to a robust confidence in the Bible alone (not the `Bible-plus').  Through it, \\"God guides us by progressively placing within us spiritual wisdom and understanding to know the will of God... He never leads us with a `guess the signs' model\\" (p. 155).  This occurs as the Christian progressively consecrates herself to Christ.  \\"The path of wisdom is a lifestyle of repentance from serving functional gods like security, safety, control,\\" etc. (p. 179).<br /><br />VERY practical, wildly applicable book.children mediately, not immediately....his guidance is mediated by (comes through) the illumination of our minds and hearts by the Word of God\\" (p. 34). <br /> <br />Petty favors and unpacks the Wisdom view in relation to four topics: 1. the doctrine of providence, 2. the sufficiency of Scripture, 3. the doctrine of illumination, 4. the current work of the Holy Spirit (p. 35).

In When God Weeps she and her longtime friend Pastor Steve Estes explore questions of theodicy beyond the superficial.  They proclaim faith in a God `big enough to understand our suffering, wise enough to allow it.\\"  This is not your superficial \\"God wants everyone to be healthy right now\\" approach!<br /><br />Their approach is radically God-centered.  Rather than starting with man's concerns and then either apologizing for God (like open theism) or accusing him (like skepticism), they attempt to start with who God is.  The first section of the book looks at God's gracious self-revelation in Christ.  With infectious joy they attempt to describe the Trinitarian God's attributes: his beauty, his goodness, his sovereignty.  Their point is that God is contented forever in his own glory.  They paint a Biblical picture of a God of infinite passion and love.  \\"Our call to suffer comes from a God tender beyond description\\" (p. 40).<br /><br />And this God is himself a sacrificial, suffering servant.  \\"The Trinity planned it.  The Son endured it.  The Spirit enabled him.  The Father rejected the Son whom he loved.  Jesus, the God-man from Nazareth, perished..... This is who asks us to trust him when he calls on us to suffer\\" (p.54).  God hates suffering (p. 57), and yet, \\"(t)he Bible could be no clearer.  God does ask his children of every nation... to suffer\\" (p. 65).  Alluding to C.S. Lewis' famous line from the Narnia series, they conclude: \\"the sovereign God who holds your days in his hand is not safe.  He's anything but.  He's the King, I tell you.  But he's good\\" (p. 93).<br /><br />Having explored God's nature and character in very personal terms, the authors next turn to described God's actions and works in Section II (pp.97f.).  As Tada learned from long, painful experience, God's Word tells us that he uses the weak of this world to accomplish his purposes,to his glory and their (our) special honor (p.113; cf. I Cor. 12:22).  In this we can have fellowship in his suffering.  They note, \\"By itself, suffering does no good.  But when we see it as the thing between God and us, it has meaning\\" (p.135).  The Cross is the key.	2004-11-04

I do it more for the parents than the kids, though my 5 year old loves this book. It really shows the meaning and value behind the church calendar and symbols, in a lucid manner with nice illustrations.  (Its a cutesy story about mice).    It often seems like Catholics I know and read tend to confuse the sign with the destination, while contemporary evangelicals (more Anabaptist than Reformational) throw away the sign all together, making it way harder to get to the destination.     Boling's work redeems it all - its a loving labor of 'sign-building!' C.S. Lewis said that the danger for Catholics at their worst is to become like every other religion (superstituous folk religion; syncretism), but the danger for (hyper-)Protestants at our worst is to become like no religion at all! Contemporary evangelcialism -- throwing away or relegating the sacraments to mere memorials, building churches without symbols or even crosses, stripping away all of the church calendar except Christmas and Easter (rescued there, only by Hallmark!), dispensing with all vestments and mystery in worship -- is becoming Lewis' nightmare.      I also think of Bunyan's allegory of there being 5 gates into Man-Soul: Eye-Gate, Ear-Gate, Nose-Gate, Mouth-Gate, Touch-Gate. We evangelicals (like Bunyan's Puritans) often close every gate except Ear-Gate in worship. In good Reformational fashion, (PCUSA pastor) Boling tries to open up Eye-Gate for us, with a rich, beautifully illustrated glossary of Christian symbols in the back.    Nothing real profound about the book, but such a nice little intro.    Great binding and illustrations the kids will like too.	2004-10-25

But if you have wrestled with him and are at peace with his idosyncratic, unique perspective, then you will find some gems in here.  This is good for devotional use.  Its useful for finding phrases for leaidng prayer in certain corporate worship settings.  It is helpful for theological reflection. <br /> <br />From time to time my Orthodox Reformed theology bristles at his Arminian (though unevenly so), Neo-Orthodoxy.  That's not the point.  If you want a 'safer', more staid, noble, reformed set of prayers, get Hughes O. Old's excellent Leading in Prayer: A Workbook.  But if you wnat a challenge and a laugh, Hauerwas is great. <br /> <br />BTW -- also a great dustjacket, a handy size, good typeface, and a nice tight binding by IVP (as usual).	2004-10-24

This would have been to my great loss, because this is easily the  best thing I have read so far this year.  In fact, I was amazed to find  that among all of the reading I've done while completing undergraduate and  graduate degrees in American history this book ranks as the best work I  have ever read on the colonial and revolutionary periods.  Simply masterful  from start to finish, Gardiner and Amos artfully fashion a wonderful  portrait of the genesis of our nation.  Leaving aside the superficial and  the cliche so characteristic of such works, the authors penetrate to the  roots of the American experience and gently expose and deflate a whole lot  of bloated revisionists history in the process.  This book will  revolutionize its readers understanding of the origins of America. Beware,  this book will have the unintended result of getting you angry at your high  school and college history teachers- you'll feel certain that they either  lied or were criminally ignorant.   My advice: buy this book and read it.   Then buy a copy for your favorite teenager and bribe him or her to read it  too.   This is one of those rare books that reminds me of why reading is so  wonderful. I just can not conceive of a better written, more thoughtfully  crafted, better illustatrated or packaged book of its kind.	2004-10-24

Ruth Tucker was teaching an adult Sunday School class on this topic of doubt shortly after writing this book.  She was well received, but after the class one older man came to her and asked, \\"I really appreciated all that you taught.  But one thing you never addressed: how did you finally overcome all your doubts?\\"  Tuckers was floored.  He missed her whole point: she has never completely overcome all her doubts.  Nor will she ever this side of glory. She teaches theology at a solidly orthodox seminary.  She is involved ijn proclaiming and defending the faith.  But she is not free of all doubt. <br /> <br />Calvin said that just as sin is always mixed in with holines sin the Christain life, so is doubt always mixed in with faith.  We are not fully rid of it until we are glorified. <br /> <br />Liberal churches tend to wrongly make a virtue of doubting -- you are not being honest and sophisticated unless you remain skeptically detached to every belief.  But conservative churches (like Tucker's audience) can be guilty of teh other extreme: 'since doubting is bad, then doubters are not welcome here.'  So when you have doubts (as all believers do) you can not voice them and seek others to help you answer them.  We need to be honest about our doubts to the appropriate people (peers and those with headship over us).  We know that doubts are generally more to do with heart problems than head problems. <br /> <br />Tucker does not say doubt is good.  But she does show it is inevitable and we shouldn't panic and think we are losing faith when it bubbles up (any more than we should when we fall into sin).   <br /> <br />Very nice packaging by the publisher also. <br /> <br />The antidote to doubt is faith in Christ, through his Word, administered in community (Church).  Christ tunrs our skepticism back onto our skepticism -- doubt your doubts!  Tucker's book is good medicine.	2004-10-24

Mathison's Given For You on Calvin's view of the Supper is a must have.  Not overly profound; reads kind of like a really, really good, long seminary paper, and occasionally cliched.  But about as good of an overview as I've seen.  Lots of nice, clearly outlined, short sub-chapters.  Makes a good argument for wine in the Meal and even for paedo-communion.  The part on Nevin is especially good.  He also shows there were important differences on the meal between fellow Princeton theologians (as well as between fellow Scottish theologians, Southern, etc.).  Because he wrote a book on postmillennialism I had avoided this one for some time, but I'm glad I gave him a chance.<br /><br />Three other books to consider: NT Wright's The Meal Jesus Gave Us; Peter Leithart's Blessed are the Hungry; and Robert Letham's one (Letham gives a counter-balance to Mathison on the Paedo-communion stuff).	2004-10-24

She is a dynamo, and her ethusiasm is infectious.      This book is very nicely packaged and well-illustrated.  Its reads alot like her popular articles for the standard amateur geneaology magazines -- clear, well-organized and targeted for the general audience.  While even the seasoned specialist will find several new things in this book, it is probably most valuable for the beginner and intermediate level genealogist.  It covers all major topics nicely and is very easy to navigate.  And it is very modesty priced for what you get.    I guess I got carried away -- i should have probably given it four stars instead.

Carter does not uncover any grand new paradigm for understanding race relations and the Church.  What he gives us is just a wonderful, accessible, little primer on the relationship and history of Reformed faith and the African American experience. Frankly, it reads alot like a very well done seminary term paper.  But he defines all the key issues and decisively answers many questions.   <br /> <br />It is painful to see so few blacks in the Reformed movement, but Carter shows this has not always been and does not have to always be.  In fact, much of the black American experience should (and sometimes has) make them especially well-suited for a Reformed theological perspective.  When this has failed to be the case, the blame lies with both whites and blacks.  Both have neglected important elements of the Gospel, and the result has been a sad lack of a dynamic Reformed witness in the black community.  Carter's critique is biting, but never angry or hurtful. <br /> <br />I bought four copies of this book.  I think every seminarian, pastor, and church officer, at minimum, should read this. <br /> <br />(BTW -- As result of the footnotes in this book I bought two copies of Black Puritan, Black Republican, which was somewhat dissappointing and dry.  It tells a great story, but 90% of it I could have gleaned forma  book review or even the dust jacket).	2004-10-24

Langer was a psychologist commissioned by the U.S. government to write this report on Hitler while the War was being fought.  It appeared in 1943.  For this reason it is very interesting -- what did they know about Hitler then?  This gives a wonderful snapshot. <br /> <br />Its also necessarily flawed -- we know MUCH more about this beast now than we did 60 yeasr ago.  Most of Langer's insights have been incorportated, no doubt, into later works.  Even the Afterword of this book lists dozens of significant factual errors.  Fascinating nevertheless. <br /> <br />Its greatest flaws are the psychoanalytical presuppositions that are its foundation.  Langer is a Freudian and he packs the book full of highly speculative, arbitrary psychobabble.  Much of this now looks even more dated and silly than it must have at the time.  (As so much of today's trendy pyschological subjectivism will look in 50 years).  It is just so arbitrary.  \\"Hitler is typical of so many children that were potty trained too early, thereby needing order and structure in their relationships....\\"  Most of this stuff is about as credible as phrenology. <br /> <br />In any case, a VERY good read.  Certainly not the place to go as a reference tool, or as the only book on Hitler.  But as long as its taken with a truckload of salt, it is very insightful.	2004-10-24

Mark Joseph loves rock music and has some great insights and biographical gems on the bands (some famous, some less well-known).  As a result of reading this book I think I added about 10 albums to my wish list. <br /> <br />Joseph's central thesis is also well-argued: Christian musicians are better off remaining in the mainstream of teh musical culture, rather than allowing themslves to be exiled to the ghetto of \\"Christian music.\\"  Once they are labeled CCM, they lose most of their potential aduience, they lose the freedoms to be creative, and they are now subject to the whims of a sub-culture that is even more banal and artless than that of secular pop music.  Joseph makes a good case for this. <br /> <br />Baker has packaged the book decently enough too, though it suffers from a lack of an index. <br /> <br />Where this book disappointed me: <br />1. The writing.  While at times Joseph shows the ability to soar, most of the time its pretty cliched and workmanlike.  His style on its own did not keep you reading. <br /> <br />2. At times Joseph is just as one-dimensional as the fundamentalists he (rightly) critiques.  For example, his loyalty to rock is such that he is unable to serious grapple with critiques like those of folsk like Charles Colson or Nancy Pearcey, who wonder whether the music's style inherantly appeals to the emotions over reason and thus has some limitations.  Joseph seems incapable of both loving the music and at the same time acknowledging its potential weaknesses. <br /> <br />Another example of this -- Joseph is eager to defend certain musicians' right (against ham-handed fundy's condemnations) to be less than orthodox and ask questions in their music.  But can he not do that while also critiquing their theology.  So Joseph will celebrate such-and-such musicians' proclamation that the God they celebrate in their songs is not the Christian God or a Muslim god or any other god, but the 'god I see when I look in my child's eyes, the god of nature...'  It seems to me that Joseph is not taking these bands seriously enough in sometimes being uncritically affirming of all they say and do. <br /> <br />Anyway, this was an enjoyable, thought-provoking read, even though I found it a little disappointing.	2004-09-20

I watch the money channels on cable, and I pick up a few things, but most of it might as well be in Mongolian to me.  I was the perfect candidate for Robert Ward's excellent new book, whihc might be subtotled \\"Options for Dummies.\\" <br /> <br />His Options and Options Trading is a practical, no-nonsense primer for the complex and mysterious world of options.  For the uninitiated like me, it is difficult going at times, but if you discipline yourself and muscle through in the end you have covered every aspect of buying, selling, and profiting from options.  His goal is introduction and translation, not advanced trading strategies.  In this he succeeds masterfully. <br /> <br />Ward demonstrates a genius for making the inscrutable accessible, leading the reader by the hand with vivid language, illustrations, and humor.  His pace is steady and deliberate, but never rushed.  He writes with an ease and comfort that comes from a complete mastery of his subject. <br /> <br />Ward instills confidence in his readers by demonstrating mathematically that good luck is not needed to succeed in options trading.  And conversely bad luck will never ruin the sensible trader, who realizes he can \\"never be bigger than the market.\\" <br /> <br />Ward telegraphs the progression of his program well, by breaking the concepts down into many easily digestable chapters, grouped in larger sections.  It is also nicely bound and packaged, and well-indexed, by McGraw Hill.  About the only criticisms I have are very mild ones: <br />1. Frankly the foreword by John Fallon comes off as a little smug and self-serving, and adds nothing to the discussion except some interesting biographical tidbids on Ward. <br />2. I did great on my math SATs, but, again, without adequate course work, beginning in chapter seven I found the math tough going sometimes.  This is cearly, however, afunction of the subject, not the author.  Or maybe its a function of this reader!  It is unavoidable.  And for this math-ophobe, he surely minimized the pain. <br /> <br />Just a few pages into teh book it's very clear why Ward has been so successful, both as a trader and as a teacher.  Add writer to the list now.  A truly magnificent work in every way.  One of the best book purchases I have ever made, and I plan to buy extra copies for Christmas gifts. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-09-15

I was hoping for something more biting and profound, as so much of Wright can often be.  That's not his intention here.  Just a  simple little primer on the Lord's Supper.  Gracefully written, devotional.  Theologically correct (from a mainstream Anglican perspective -- pretty much in agreement with Calvinist folks), but not beholden to his tradition for tradition's sake.    For all his immense learning, his practical focus, and his rhetorical powers, he can still be a little \\"wooly\\" at times.  For example, on pp. 60f. he gives about as simple and clear explanation of the Marburg debates and their aftermath as you will read anywhere - yet he quickly becomes murkier when explaining his own take on the issues.  After seeming to favor Cranmer and Calvin and Oecolampadius over both Zwingli and Luther, he sidesteps the whole discussion.  He prefers, he says, to think in terms of \\"time\\" rather than \\"space.\\"  From there the simple elegance of his discussion breaks down a little and the reader is left a little puzzled.      Anyway, overall a very nice little book -- accessable to a general audience.    For a thinking layman, I would follow this up with Peter Leithart's Blessed are the Hungry, or Keith Mathison's book on Calvin's view of the Supper.	2004-06-07

McCarthy is a theo. prof. at a Catholic college in Maryland, probably in his late-30s.  He uses everyday anecdotes to expose the struggle middle-class suburban Christians are in, often without knowing it.  The book is 27 small chapters broken into 4 categories: People (friendship, marriage, sex and singleness, God and neighbor, etc.), Places (home and hospitality, country and nation, etc.); Things (debts, work); and God (breaking down the elements of the Apostle's Creed).     James K. A. Smith of Calvin College writes in a blurb on the back cover: \\"How can we resist the empire's demand for our allegiance?  This remains a fundamental question for Christain discipleship, and in The Good Life, McCarthy poses it afresh.  But now the empire is not Rome but the market, and the arena of challenge is not the colliseum but Wal-Mart.  He offers challenging wisdom to those of us in minivans who are trying to discern what God's disruptive grace means for our friendships, our neighborhoods, and our consumer habits.\\"    Another blurb: \\"Don't let the charm of his style or his mastery of the telling detail mislead you.  McCarthy's The Good Life is both a sustained critique of the consumerism that enslaves and a profound account of how God's graciousness can set us free.  This is theology at its best.  A  how to book about something that matters.\\"    My biggest dissapointment with the book -- it does not emphasize strongly enough the centrality of the Church.  Chap. 25 on the \\"One, Holy, Apostolic Church,\\" was very insightful.  But any study of Christian ethics needs to communicate clearly to our individualist culture -- the Church is not one means to the end, it IS the end.  The Church isn't a tool for the individual Christain to use for their personal growth, it is the object of the Christian life.  The Gospel is not Christ.  It is Christ and his Church.  McCarthy may understand that, and certainly has plenty of Gospel-driven things to say about the centrality of community, but I didn't think that point was made clearly enough.    Also, a good index would have helped.  I have not read this cover to cover yet, but found myself flipping back and forth.  I may have missed things.  But I didn't see anything on the role of the Lord's Supper in discipleship (funny for a Presbyterian to be criticizing a Catholic for that!).    Overall, one of the best things I have read on the topic.  I'm going to buy more copies for friends and parishoners.	2004-05-01

Its the 3rd edition with new intro since its original publication in 1977.  Dr. Riley-Smith, full professor at Cambridge, is THE leading authority on the Crusades.  <br />This book is a workout for the non-specialist.  Its obstensibly an exercise in definition: Few ever bother to define what exactly is a 'Crusade' and what isn't -- he shows the different schools of thought on this question and renders his own judgment.  In the process he gives an historic overview, a highly sophisticated commentary on the crusade ideal (and ways the actual practice fell short), and much more.  One of the best succinct definitions of the Christian Just War theory I've ever seen (as well as Holy War theories that have fallen out of favor).  <br />If this leaves you wnating more, check out Riley-Smith's masterful The Crusades: A Short History (Yale).  Also see the special issue  on the Crusades by Christain history magazine form a few years ago (back issues available from Christianity Today Institute online).  It is richly illustrated and includes a masterful interview with Riley-Smith among other things for a few dollars.	2004-04-30

I just picked this up yesterday in a used book sale and could not put it down until I had finished more than half of it in one sitting.  I've read a number of works on the Holocaust in the past couple of years and I found this one, while not the most interesting, certainly the most directly applicable to my life.  It surely persuaded me of the truth of the subtitle: Why Christians Must Not Forget the Holocaust.      David Rausch (Ph.D. Kent State) was (is?) a professor of church history and Judaic studies at Ashland Seminary, an evangelical school in Ohio.  He has organized a truly massive amount of information into nice bite-sized chapters, with plenty of subheadings.  This is a book that is very clear about where it is heading each step of the way.    What it lacks in artistic pretense it more than makes up for in honesty, facts, and earnestness.  It gives as solid and balanced of a basic history of Hitler and Nazism as I have yet seen.  He shows fascism in all its contradictions and moral complexities.  Some of this makes us very uncomfortable.  There is such tragedy in learning of just how the Poles (victims of Russian Stalinist and German Nazi attrocities themselves) would continue the vicious slaughter of Jews AFTER the Nazis fell, continuing the evil work of the concentration camps through a thousand small acts of murder against their defenseless survivors.  The irony is that when Hitler was done eliminating the Jews, he fully intended to do the same to most of the Poles and other Slavs.    What was the roles of Christians in this whole ordeal?  And was there a difference between the behaviors of 'real\\" Christians (church going, Bible-believing evangelicals and Catholics) vs. that of the nominal or cultural Christians?  As a commited Christian, its uncomfortable to see the answer is Yes  AND No.  Yes, it is true -- Hitler and all the top Nazi leadership were contemputous of the traditional church and its teaching.  They were occultists or agnostic to the man.Like Nietzsche before them, they saw in the Gospel the anti-thesis of the 'will to power,\\" viewing Biblcial ethics as weak and foolish.  And, yes, its also true that the active churchman most sympathetic to the Nazis were mostly theological liberals and radicals (think Heidegger, Althaus, etc.).  And yes, there were many courageous Christians of the evangelcial or conservative Catholic variety who gave their lives to fight Naziism and defend Jews.  BUT, Rausch shows, there were also many evangelicals and Catholics who thrilled to Hitler, and turned a blind eye to his regime's evil.  Others, while not advocating genoicde, were enthusiastic anti-Semities and racists.  And also, Rausch shows in great detail, there were some righteous Gentile rescuers who were liberals, agnostics, atheists.  Its not such a neat, tidy picture, as the contemprary church would like it to be.    From there Rausch shows, quite convincingly, how Germany was the last place in Europe where Jews would expect pogroms.  If it could happen there, why not here?  Further, he points us to our less than perfect legacy on racism in America.    Very convicting.   Earnest without being self-righteous or imbalanced.    Overall, a very fine, and very important book.  I wish its sales rank was much higher!	2004-04-19

The subtitle says it all: this book is all about \\"taking control of your life.\\" That such a phrase can be heralded as a genuine Christian goal should terrify us all. Where is the Church headed? Is the Gospel really about \\"taking control of your life\\"?<br /><br />This book gives good, solid advice about how to take control of your life; how to protect yourself from folks who will seek to hurt or discourage you. But is that what Jesus wants for us? Is that 'taking up your cross daily'?<br /><br />When you read this, ask yourself: What do I mean by 'boundaries?' Is it a rule, a fence, to keep people from controlling you/violating your personhood? Do you think \\"I should get to shape my own identity, my choices, my will, my life, my emotion.\\"? And is that a Biblical approach? Is the Bible really a self-help book?<br /><br />What is right about that: The Bible says there are places where you stop and start ('boundaries in that sense). It is wrong to allow other people to live as if they exist for themselves and not for God. You should call peopel to accounatbility when they do that, and try to involve you in that.<br /><br />BUT when you do that not to be protected, but to SERVE.<br /><br />Ask 'how does Scripture orient me differently or take me further?' The Bible says our focus must be on the heart - not self-help, not controlling others. Its all about changing my own motives.<br /><br />'Boundaries,' the way Cloud and Townsend employ the term, is a negative and defensive concept. It is about self-protection. Tell that to the martyrs in Makulu, Indonesia, or Nigerian. They know the Gospel is much more wonderful, and much less self-absorbed, than that!<br /><br />Jesus' boundaries are love, not defensiveness. Yes, loving you may well mean saying no to you, prohibiting you, but the boundary is menat to be a means to love.<br /><br />The Gospel is NEVER about living defensively and creating walls, defending yourself to protect yourself. You can say 'yes' out of love, or you may say 'no' out of love. But it is all about loving others, serving.<br /><br />I can sympathize with the concerns of this book. Drs. Cloud and Townsend have lovingly sought to help some very hurting people. But the most helpful thing for us when we are under attack is not to assert our 'rights' and seek protection -- that never works anyway -- but to live the Gospel. Our Savior asserted no rights, but only served. This didn't make him a 'doormat' - he rebuked, declared judgment, etc. BUT he did it not to protect himself, but to serve others.	2004-04-16

My 4 yera old loves it.  It really shows the meaning and value behind the church calendar and symbols, in a lucid manner.  It seems to me that while Catholics overemphasize these things (and sometimes are tempted to confuse the symbols with the reality itself), 21st century Evangelicals have overcorrected -- throwing the calendar and symbols and ritual out all together.  Its like the Catholics seem to confuse the sign with the destination, and we contemporary evangelicals (more Anabaptist now than Reformational) throw away the sign all together making it harder to get to the destination.  Boling's work is a loving labor of 'sign-building!'  C.S. Lewis said that the danger for Catholics at their worst is to become like every other religion (superstituous folk religion; syncretism), but the danger for Protestants at our worst is to become like no religion at all!  Contemporary evangelcialism -- throwing away or relegating the sacraments to meer memorials, building chucrhes without symbols or even crosses, stripping away all of the church calendar except Christmas and Easter (rescued there, only by Hallmark!), dispensing with all vetsments and mystery in worship -- is becoming Lewis' nightmare.  And utterly rootless to boot.<br />And I think of Bunyan's allegory of there being 5 gates into Man-Soul: Eye-Gate, Ear-Gate, Nose-Gate, Mouth-Gate, Touch-Gate.  We evangelicals (liek Bunyan's Puritans) often close every gate except Ear-Gate in worship.  In good Reformational fashion, eveanglecila Presbyterian Boling tries to open up Eye-Gate for us, with a rich, beautifully illustrated glossary of Christian symbols in the back.<br />Anyway, my [children]loves the book, and now can tell us why Lent reminds us to repent, why Advent gets us ready forChristmas, and that when he sees the Alpha Omega it means God is with us from the beginning end.	2004-03-28

This project sought to bring together one of the most prestigious array of scholars in recent memory.  The occassion was a large gathering on the historic campus of Princeton Theological Seminary, where Hodge taught 2000 students over 56 years in the 19th century.  The scholars are from a staggering variety of fields.  Most knew very little about Hodge before receiving their assignments, and generally they ranged from previously dismissive to openly hostile to Hodge and what he represented (with the exceptions of Mark Noll and possibly Allen Guelzo).  <br />The interesting thing is that in the course of researching for their talks, many of these scholars came to a deep appreciation and respect for Hodge.  Hodge, it seems, is one of those figures modern scholars think they can categorize and dismiss (you know, \\"proto-fundamentalist\\" - sniff, sniff -- \\"rigid Calvinist\\" -- sniff, sniff).  It turns out that Hodge may be, as a small band of specialist have long contended, about the most dynamic and interesting thinkers of his (or any other generation).  Even this band of rigid modernists seems to have learned this in the course of their work.<br />There are flaws to the book: a few of the essays are pretty weak.  And it might have been interesting to throw in at least one openly unapologetic Hodge fan (after all there are many, including some good professional scholars).  Also perhaps another speaker out of the dozen or so could have been selected who might have critical engaged Hodge in terms of his usefulness for contemporary heirs of the conservative Reformed movement -- someone who could show his enduring value for that large and vibrant community, while also pointing out how some aspects of his system have been discarded (postmil., Scottish Common Sense, low sacramentology, etc.)<br />Overall, well worth the read.  (And nicely packaged by Eerdmans too!)	2004-03-11

Dembski is a real master at organizing a tremendous amount of material and getting straight to the point.  The result can be slow going for the non-specialist like myself, but very rewarding.<br />Despite all the desperate attempts to silence ID, they are not going away.  Chapter 41 (Peer Review) alone is worth the cover price -- it shows the lengths to which the neo-Darwinian establishment will go to belittle and marginalize any creative attempts to question them.  Whatever you think of ID and the debates, this chapter will interest anyone who cares about free speech and about the growing illiberal nature of the academy.<br />Dembski, like several others in the ID movement (see Jonathan Wells, or some of the contributors to Mere Creation), is one of the great intellectual athletes of this generation: a Ph.D. in math from Chicago, another Ph.D. in philosophy; graduate and post doc degrees in theology (Princeton Seminary), computers, biology, etc. from places like Princeton U. and MIT, with a huge corpus of writings.  He's a renaissance man who really is able to master several disciplines and show connections between them.  That makes his books so fun and engaging even for people without special interest in science.<br />Of all his books, I found this one probably the most engaging, and most able to help me see how ID ties into a larger framework of worldview issues.	2004-03-10

Her accounts are often very moving, and the book is nicely done.  She makes an idealistic plea for government and voluntary institutional support for altruism as a safeguard against future genocide, which is charming, but even she admits this may be a little too 'utopian.'<br />I really appreciated this book, and was touched by the sobering picture of how modernity and secularism have not brought real moral progress, but instead have made it easier to carry out evil in a grander scale.  I don;t think this is the author's point, but it certainly was a conclusion I draw from all such accounts fo 20th century genocide.<br />My only dissappointments with the book -- while Fogelman as a psychologist proports probe the MOTIVES behind the extraordinary courage shown by the Gentile rescurers -- how their own 'moral compass' gave them the ability to stand against antisemitic hate, she shows very little understanding of how Biblical Christian values were likely decisive in so many cases.  She seems somewhat ill-equipped to probe the motives of the truly committed Christian.  Perhaps this explains why she makes no mention at all of some of the most famous and interesting cases of rescuers who acted out of profoundly Biblical convictions of justice and mercy (like Corrie Ten Boom, whose story is told in the book and film The Hiding Place; or Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who is give just one sentence in the book).<br />Overall, a very helpful and moving book.	2004-02-18

It is an amazing story that draws you in on several levels: as a case study of Jewish life in germany during the Nazi years; as a touching biographical account of an unique woman; as a reseachers detective story; etc.  Genealogists might also be interested in the remarkable ways Roseman ferreted out data.<br />Bottom line: a remarkable story, very well told.  Roseman is an incredible and tenacious researcher, and a pretty decent writer.  It is a work out, and might have been better if condensed by maybe a 100 pages or so.<br />One pet point -- Rev. Dietrich Bonhoeffer's small role in teh narrative comes up a few times.  He was a brother-in-law to one of the Wehrmacht generals who wanted Hitler dead and tried to rescue Jews.  Bonhoeffer's own story has been told many times -- how he escaped Germany to be a professor in New York, but chose to return to fight Hitler and ended up martyred in a concentration camp.  Anyway, Bonhoeffer's name appears in the book more often than the index indicates (see also p. 251, for example), and Roseman never mentions the interesting fact that he was a Lutheran pastor and theologian.<br />Also, poersonally I was longing for more photos as I tried to visualize the cats of characters.<br />Anyway, one of the best things I have read in awhile.  Makes Melissa Mueller's bio. of Anne Frank seem dull.	2004-02-02

Longman is VERY sharp.  A Yale Ph.D. with years of teaching experience, he knows his stuff.  Great authroity.  Very, very good resource.<br />The negatives -- this third edition is not what it could be.  <BR>Omissions are plentiful.  How could he possibly exclude reviews of Dale Ralph Davis' commnetaries on Joshua, Judges, I and 2 Samuel and I Kings?  These are some of the best commentaries I've ever used.  Another example, how could he leave out O. Palmer Robertson on Jonah?<br />Also, he often does not clue the reader in on the ideological biases of some works.  P. 23 doesn't mention that the Daily Study Bible series is highly critical.  Same for p. 58 and Kath. Sakenfeld (far left).  <br />Other puzzles -- how can a book on p. 20 be a &quot;fine&quot; commentary when he gives it just 2 stars (overall he is a very generous grader!).<br />Some are P&amp;R publishers' editing flaws.  How can Longman mention in vol. 1 of a set that the author for vol. 2 is &quot;announced&quot; for the future to be.... when vol. 2 is already out and reviewed by Longman?  (see p. 100).  Also, some abbreviations used don't appear in the Abbreviation Key (&quot;MT&quot; on p. 107).  In three places Longman reviews his own books in the first person (&quot;I was trying to do this...&quot;), whereas for another of his books he refers to himself in the third person as &quot;Longman&quot; (see p. 89).  On p. 128 he says it would be &quot;inappropriate&quot; for him to comment on his own book (no way!), but he does this anyway in four other cases.<br />Overall, excellent book.  But it needs better editing, and the addition of some outstanding works that are ignored.  (He could easilly cut some things, if need be, that are highly dated, and irrelevant.)	2003-11-17

No matter what someone may think of the particular beliefs of these two young woman, who can doubt that they are especially virtuous people?  They are attractive, educated, talented women who freely chose to live in a hostile and poor country to minister to the people's phsyical and spiritual needs.  <br />The writing is fair.  Their story is pretty interesting. They give us a decent window into a world that all Americans need to better understand.  But the best part of the book to me is their deep love and respect for the Afghani people. These are pretty rough people that very few Westerners would dare visit, never mind live among.  But these two women clearly fell in love with the Afghanis.  Really interesting to see how this happens.	2003-06-07

He illustrates how the Old Testament is as much about Christ as the New Testament is.

While every word in Clowney is golden, and his style is very lyrical and engaging, one wishes he had a better editor to organize the thoughts in chunks they would hang together.  This made it difficult to adapt to an adult c.e. series, when I did that 5 years ago.<br />BTW -- if you liked this book's Christo-centric approach, try Charlie Drew's Ancient Love Song (2001) which is better organized.

The irony is that in Dr. Migliore's anxiety to escape any received traditions that might be man-centered and deeply intertwined with our (oppresive) human social orders, he has so gutted his theology that there is nothing transcendant left of it either.  He classifies all the classic, ecumenical attributes of God (absoluteness, immutability, omnipotence, etc., see the rant on p.78, for example) as human metaphysical constructs, so in the end there is nothing left of God, at least not as he is revealed in Scripture.  <br />Dr. Migliore knows his theology and has taught for over 30 years at (arguably) America's most prestigious mainline Protestant seminary (Princeton). You get the sense that the classic liberal/neo-orthodox models leave him wanting and empty, so he grasps for a political/social fad in hopes of finding something truly redemptive.  Sort of pray he will try the timeless Gospel of grace instead, and find real, lasting 'liberation' there.<br />A better critique of Liberation Theology is by Ronald Nash.	2003-02-20

They are always helpful and worth reading.  This one I was particularly excited about.  As a pastor who does alot of counseling, reads a lot on the topic, and is pursuing a DMin in the field, I really wanted a book that would help me get a handle on the various models available.  While the book was informative, I really think its the least engaging of all the 4 views ones I have read.<br />My biggest problem was the way it seemed biased agianst the &quot;Biblcial&quot; model (one of the 4 views).  Obviously, in every one of these books my own view (if I clearly fall into one of the 4 camps) will be roughly one-quarter of the book.  It will be opposed by a 3 to 1 ratio. That's why you read these books.  But what I found a little vexing was the way the editors framed the &quot;Biblical&quot; model in their long (and very informative) introductory essay.  While giving a fairly balanced presentation of the other 3 models, the Biblical model is largely dismissed.  The one figure mentioned is the founder of the movement, Jay Adams.  That is appropriate, but the reader is left with the impression that the movement is essentailly Adams-ism. The fact is that the movement took Adams' initial insights and went in a direction that Adams has largely denounced.  The book's author of the Biblical view section, for example, (David Powlison) is one who has been very critical of Adams (and vice versa).  The editors' seeming disdain for the Biblical model also seems reflected in the concluding chapter.  <br />Still, a helpful work.  The packaging and the indeex and bibliograph are also very nice.	2002-10-12

The angry opponents are partly right -- Martin can be obnoxious at points and his credentials were given slight spin.  The conservatives are partly right -- this is an undeniably great book by an expert who writes with zest.<br /><br />Education -- Martin got a graduate degree (MA) from NYU in philosophy.  He also did graduate work at an accredited seminary.  But, yes, his doctorate was from a diploma mill.  Regardless, he spent 40 years reading, debating and pouring over everything the cultists wrote.  He really knew his stuff.<br /><br />The book is just flat out a good read.  Really interesting.  The facts are generally very well researched.  His style is obnoxious at points -- especially if its your group who he is exposing -- but his facts are right.  You get the sense that he enjoys exposing the lies of these cults just a little too much.<br /><br />Bottom line -- It remains the standard of its kind.  It was required reading 15 years ago for a comparative religions course I took at a secular university, taught by a very liberal professor.  I have refered back to it often over the years and have found it to be very helpful.  Frankly, its fun -- reads like a novel at places.

I gave it just 2 stars.    This new edition is significantly larger and much improved.  The author made corrections in almost all of the cases I had noted.   He was kind enough to send me a complimentary copy and we have dialogued on some of my concerns.    The scope of this work is massive.  800 pages with thousands of entries.  It is packed with some very good reference data.  Balmer's commentary on his subjects is pointed and often very lively. The packaging and cover design are great (though I miss the hardcover of the first edition).     I offer the following not to question his competence or integrity, but as illustrations of some continued flaws in this new edition (some minor, some significant).  Many of these are in the new entries.    p. 65 \\"Belhaven\\": The correct name of the denomination these days is PCUSA, not PCUS.    I am sure this is unintentional, but progressive/ moderate/ liberal evangelicals Metzger, Roger Olsen, Ron Sider, Mark Noll, Nathan Hatch, Marsden etc. all have \\"Ph.D.s\\", but IDENTICALLY credentialed Boice (p.90), Harold O. J. Brown (p. 105), D.A. Carson(p. 138), Everett F. Harrison (p. 325), D. James Kennedy (p. 379), Cornelius Van Til (p. 711), Charles Woodbridge (p. 759) just have 'degrees'.    p.101 \\"British Israelism\\" Mistakenly lists two tribes of Israel and ten lost tribes of Judah (reversed).  It also fails to mention Herbert W. Armstrong, its most famous proponent.    p. 180 mentions Colson's Brown Univ. degree but leaves out his law degree.    P. 182 -- An entry on Concordia Theological Seminary in IN, and no entry on Concordia Seminary St. Louis      P. 387 \\"Koop\\" Never mentions he was an active elder in the PCA (Boice's 10th Pres.) for years.    p. 510 \\"Olson\\" Is listed as CSR's editor \\"1994 to 1991.\\"    p. 537 \\"Pew\\"  Grove City College is printed in caps with an asterix next to it but has no entry in the book.    p. 554: \\"PCA\\"  Mentions the church and membership numbers when they started, but never anything more current.  They are posted in the web page: up to 1550 churches and 310,000 members -- something like an 600% growth in 30 years.  States simply that the PCA \\"PROFESSES to be one of the most rapidly growing denominations...\\"  How about it 'reports'  that?      p. 570: \\"Reed\\" He \\"eventually received the degree [Ph.D. Emory] in 1991..\\"  \\"Eventually?\\"  He was age 29 when he got it (even though he took a break in between degrees).  That's younger than most, INCLUDING Balmer.    p. 571: \\"RCA\\" I would mildly dispute that they have \\"remained theologically conservative\\", except in the Michigan area.       p. 604: \\"Franky Schaeffer\\" \\"he moved from the FUNDAMENTALISM of his father\\"?  Aside from a belief in inerrancy, Francis Schaeffer the elder had none of the classic characteristics of a 'fundamentalist\\" (secondary separation; Christ against culture; dispensationalism; legalistic moral code, etc.)    p. 611: lists Witherspoon as the pres. of the \\"College of NJ\\" without noting that this is now called Princeton Univ.    p. 670: Talmage an \\"evangelical\\"?    P. 705: \\"Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches\\" -- Was Perry excommunicated for his \\"homosexuality,\\" as Balmer states, or was it rather for his(unrepentant) \\"homosexual practice?\\"    p. 718: Warfield was from a Kentucky family, not a Virginia one.    p. 730: When he lists the conservative faculty that left Princeton to start Westminster, he does not include Oswald Allis (and why no entry on him?).  Also, incorrectly lists Westminster in California as a 'satellite' campus.  That's understandable since it started that way about 25 years ago.  But it is now fully independent with no formal  relation to Westminster PA and TX.  Actually it should get its own entry -- its fully accredited (unlike Knox which is listed in both editions) and it has a much larger enrollment than Knox, with a similarconstituency.    p. 732 \\"Alma White\\" WAS part of the Pentecostal Union, but it is misleading without noting that in this case 'Pentecostal' refers, I think, to Pentecost, as this group did not experience glossalia.    Some entries that people might like to see in the next edition: John Piper, Allan Macrae, World magazine.    Overall, vastly improved and very helpful if you are aware of the bias against theological and political conservatives.	2002-07-19

I was thrilled to get this thick dictionary, with so many entires and photos.  It is well-bound and handsomely packaged by Zondervan.<br />The problem is that it is just so poorly done!  It lists several good scholars among its contributors (Edith Blumhoefer, David Barrett, Grant Wacker, Gordon Fee), but these folks didn't write most of the articles.  I can't believe Zondervan didn't require better work, or do some heavier editing.  While some entires are clearly and crisply written, many are almost unreadable. One rambling article mentions A.J. Gordon, identifying his ministry role, then a couple of paragraphs later reintroduces him, then does it again, etc.  Its as if the article were originally 3 or 4 pieces, which were later thrown together with no editing.  <br />Another issue I have is the defensive, propaganda-like tone of most articles.  For example, George and Stephen Jeffreys are identified without qualification as *England's greatest evangelists since Wesley and Whitefield*.  Huh?!?  Many times a person will be identified as one of the *foremost scholars* on a certain topic, simply because they wrote an obscure book on the subject.  Often these will be decidely unscholarly, untrained preachers --  their books may be helpful, but these folks are most often nowhere close to being *scholars.*  Similarly, entires often incorrectly imply certain figures are Pentecostal/ charismatic (for example, one entry lists Spurgeon among some charismatics simply because he prayed for and received healing -- something close to 100 percent of non-charismatic evangelicals have always believed in).  The authors also tend to downplay or ignore embarrassing heresies in their Pentecostal subjects -- One-ness/Sabellian beliefs, quasi-Messianic claims, etc.  Parham's long entry never mentions his teaching against the tradition view of final judgment (Conditional Immortality).  Indeed, the United Pentecostal Church, Intern'l, classified as a cult by several mainstream evaneglical watchdog groups, contributes several articles to the dictionary.  And the book often uncritically accepts triumphalistically many questionable stats.  In many places, *revival* is narrowly defined as exercising supernatural gifts.  For example, an entry on Presbyterian and Reformed charismatics states that Presbyterians have historically been involved in revival and only lists tongues experiences (rather than, say, leading the Great Awakening of the 18th century) as examples.  Apparently its not a  revival unless something overtly miraculous happens.<br />I could go on and on.  Bottom-line -- profoundly dissappointing book.  I gave it two stars rather than one because it does give some good reference information (if taken with a big chunk of salt).<br />Hope the updated version is an improvement, because this is an important and interesting topic that deserves better treatment.	2002-03-30

Sure, if you are a Gnostic you probably don't agree with Peter Jones' judgments.  But don't try to belittle his intelligence or his command of the subject matter.  He has a Ph.D. from Princeton Seminary, he's been a theology porfessor for years, and he has written a number of books on the topic.  He knows the arguments and counter-arguments.  If you disagree, just say so, but don' make these silly attacks on Dr. Jones' competence.  He's very sharp.<br />I found the book to be a good introduction to the topic.  I used it in an adult c.e. setting at our church, where we spent 13 weeks with it.  Most folks appreciated the book and were challenged by it.  It helped us understand the appeal of a puzzling movement, and how a neo-pagan worldview hangs together coherently.<br />It is concise, rather than comprehensive.  It does not explore all the varieties of the New Age movement.  Its not intended to do that.  But its well worth the investment of a few hours of redaing time and a few dollars.<BR>I bought extra copies for friends and for the church library.	2001-09-05

With degrees from Princeton and Yale and thirty years of teaching at the seminary and graduate level (Westminister Sem. and Reformed Sem.), he is a very sharp guy and a deep thinker.  But his talent comes in the way he is able to synthesize difficult concepts and place them in accessible and easily understood language.    This is a good book.  He is coming from a Reformed perspective, with a broad commitment to the regulative principle of worship.  But he has an openness which enables him to see beyond the social accidents of his tradition and go back to Scripture for correction and guidance.  He is able to sort out what is inconsistent in his tradition with the main impulses that have driven it.  He also is good at sorting out the modern equivalents to ancient Biblical directives.    This book discusses the proper elemenst of worship, various styles, and content.  It is always fresh, accessible, challenging, and insightful, even when you disagree with the author.  I highly recommend it.    If you are looking for other approaches somewhat at varience with Frame, you might try:  Hughes O. Old (more liturgically rich; extremely good), or Robert Rayburn (a generation older and sometimes wiser).  I also like Jeff Meyers, The Lord's Service (on covenant renewal).	2001-08-13

This was laregly due to how he was able to apply his keen insights to such a wide number of cultural interests. Dr. Hodge had his fingers on the pulse of politics, the arts, literature and history. After theology his greatest interest was in science. He enjoyed lively debate and had strong opinions, but he was always fair and gracious to his opponents. Folks often disagreed with Hodge's conclusions, but they always knew he was going to summarized the subject at hand lucidly and insightfully.<br />This book is chiefly known for its conclusion, *What is Darwinism? It is atheism.* This is unfortunate. He only condemns Darwinism after he has spent more than 100 pages closely defining it. It is not all change that he condemns, or even evolution, but a particular species of evolution -- naturalistic Darwinism.<br />Hodge rarely made hasty judgments. He wa sone of the first theologians to comment on Darwin's The Origin of Species (1859) in print -- 1861. Hodge spent many years studying all aspects of the theory. He identifies its strengths as well as its philosophical inconsistencies.<br />This book is of great value not only to those interested in theology and 19th century history and culture, but also to those interested in the contemporary debates over the merits of Neo-Darwinism (Hodge would have surely been fascinated by the exciting new Intelligent Design [ID] theorists -- like William Dembski, Jonathan Wells, Hugh Ross, Michael Behe, etc.).	2001-07-30

At times I really enjoyed it. But overall I found it a little disappointing. Carter endless boasting is too much to stomach.  <br /> <br />The most helpful aspect of this book was to understand better the contours of Carter's personal theology. What is very clear is that by any classical standard Carter may be a committed Christian but he is no evangelical. His beliefs include: Homosexual practice is acceptable (p.187), Biblical inerrancy is ridiculous (p.197-8), Reinhold Niebuhr and Soren Kierkegaard are his favorite theologians, Mormons are Christian, evolution is not up for debate....  <br /> <br />A pretty helpful book for political junkies needing to know more about Carter, but not as helpful as an inspirational aid for Christians.  <br /> <br />I probably would have given it 3 stars if I hadn't gone into it with higher hopes.	2001-07-30

There was the article in the Wall Street Journal about the tenured full professor at San Frans. State U. who was pulled mid-semester from teaching the biology intro. course because he spent a single session presenting views such as ID that challenged the reigning Neo-Darwinian dogma.  There was the fury I heard on NPR over Phillip Johnson's *Darwin on Trial.*  There was Dembski's dismissal from his post at Baylor U. for inviting non-Darwinian speakers to a academic forum on the origins of life.<br />Why were so many folks so emotionally opposed to a handful of scientists who are finding compelling eveidence for God's fingerprint in nature?<br />I've now read a few of these ID books now and am very impressed.  This latest work is a very fine introduction.  The contributors are all top-drawer thinkers (Dembksi has a Ph.D. from U. of Chicago in Math. and a 2nd Ph.D. from Univ. of Illinois in the philosophy of science, along with masters in hard sciences and theology; Michael Behe has a Ph.D. in biochemistry from Penn and is a full professor at Lehigh U; Phillip Johnson is a logician who is a chaired, full prof. at Berkeley and clerked for the chief justice of the US Supreme Court; Stephen Meyer has his Ph.D. from Cambridge; Jonathan Wells has a Ph.D. from yale in history of science and another from Berkeley in biology, etc. etc.)  These are extrememly well-trained, sharp folks, from a variety of backgrounds and fields.  But the essays are, for the most part, very accessible to laypersons, like myself.<br />I enjoyed every one of the pieces in this book, but especially Jay W. Richards' (Ph.D. Princeton Seminary) and Dembskis'.<br />Whatever your views on this subject, I would urge you to read this book and see what all the fuss is about.	2001-07-30

Stanford Reid's *Trumpter of God* is considered the standard.  But Wilson's is by far the most engaging.      I am not a Wilson fan at all.  But this is a good read.    Wilson has not attempted a comprehensive biography.  Instead he hits the milestones and highlights what made Knox one of the most interesting figures in Western history. WIlson seems to have relied primarily on 2 or 3 sources and has little to no familiarity with the bulk of the scholarly literature on Knox, but this matters little for the scope of this work.      Wilson makes contemporary, practical applications from Knox's that the reader will find very challenging.	2001-07-29

Most &quot;Barthians&quot; are far less orthodox than Barth.  Often they have affinities to some small aspect of his approach to theology, while rejecting the rest of this thought that hangs with it.<br />Bruce McCormack is not one of these pretenders!  While perhaps not a &quot;slavish&quot; Barthian, McCormack is a Barthian that Barth would recognize, appreciate, and support.<br />In general, McCormack wants to present Barth as classically orthodox, not &quot;neo-orthodox.&quot;  This is a difficult task in many ways, because of Barth's novel appraoch and his departure from the theology of the Reformation on many points (outright rejection of all natural theology, Barth's universal salvation, his rejection of Biblical inspiration opting for an emphasis on illumination instead, etc.)<br />McCormack is one of the sharpest minds in the mainline church.  I studied under him for two degrees at Princeton, where he was clearly the brightest theologian in a brilliant department.  Unfortunately, like his hero Barth, he is not often kind to his reader.  He makes you work very hard.  This is a difficult read.  But many will find it worth the effort, not matter what their view of Karl Barth.	2001-03-25

Everyone knows it is about the most influential work of its kind ever produced in the English language.  But few people know anything about the men who composed it.  This is the only book I know of that has composed biographical portraits of the Westminster Divines.  What Dr. Barker so well illustrates is that these were a diverse group of churchmen, with different temperments and experiences.  They were united by a common commitment to the Word and the threat of royal execution for their participation.    Dr. Barker is a gifted historian and writer.

Mead was far less politically correct.  For example, in the Nation of Islam/Black Muslim entry Mead would not shy away from mentioning the more distinctive features of this group (such as the mythology of white folks being the product of a failed experiment by an ancient black scientist, ideas of the whites as the serpent, etc.)  Hill seems to have removed many of the more objectionable features of many groups, which is what often would help the reader understand the distinctives and uniqueness of that denomination. <br />Also, I found Hill's statistics to often be very dated.  For example, the stats on the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) were about 6-8 years out of date.  The PCA was one of the fastest growing evangelical denominations in America during that time, and as a result Hill's stats are about half of the accurate number (150,000 rather than 300,000).   Many smaller Presbyterian denominations (at least 3 I could think of) were not even listed.	2001-03-25

Not one book was by a contemporary conservative/evangelical, of course.  I had a question on the ordo salutis, which none of the books for the course addressed.  I asked my professor(probably the most distinguished theologian at Princeton and certainly no evangelical) for help.  He looked around and literally whispered to me *Don't tell anyone I said this.  But the best book on the atonement written in the last 100 years is John Murray's Redemption: Accomplished and Applied.

Its topic is wonderful and the scope and conception are great.  It gives lots of detail on most all of the Southern Presbyterian theologians of Union (VA) and Columbia (SC/GA) seminaries.  I appreciated Dr. Smith's sympathy for the figures he studies.  His evangelical and Reformed commitments allow him to often see men like Dabney and Thornwell with great understanding.<br />This is a reprint of Dr. Smith's doctoral dissertation from Free University, Amsterdam.  P&amp;R has packaged it very nicely.<br />I don't know how I can possibly list all of the disappointing features of this book, however.  The pickiest problem -- in 40 years nobody has bothered to catch all of the embarrassing factual errors in this text!  For example, several pages are dedicated to William *Swain* Plumer (correct spelling *Swan*).  There are literally dozens of these type of errors which undermine the credibility of the author.<br />Far more serious is the poor approach to history that Smith takes.  He has a chip on his shoulder and this makes him look, well, silly.  He goes to huge lengths to try to show that the Southern Presbyterians were superior to the Old Princetonians.  The evidence he gathers on this is really very, very weak.<br />Further, he wants to argue that all the Southern Presbyterians were in lock-step agreement on full-subscription, no-exception belief in the Westminster Standards.  Anybody who has spent any time at all reading them knows that this is not true.  Yes, the major figures, at least, were all ardent Calvinists and did not waver on Biblical authority or the major doctrines.  But they also reflected the diversity of any significant school of Reformed theology.  Especially on secondary points of theology.  Smith does not do these wonderful men a service by artifically restricting their very interesting theologies.<br />Another problem is that Smith seems to have gathered very poor information on some of the minor figures.  But this does not stop him from making conclusions which he has not demonstrated.  Smith will state things like this (I'm making this example up): *Dr. Jones taught at Union Seminary from 1902-04.  He did not publish any articles.  But we know he must have been an advocate of full subscription to the Westminster Confession and a 24-hour day creationist because he taught at Union.  In addition, this author's uncle once took a course from him and commented that Dr. Jones was a fine conservative gentleman.*  Give me a break!<br />Further, Dr. Smith lets his disgust for the Northern U.S. show every so often and this really doesn't help his case.<br />This book did help me gain some insight into Dr.Smith's attitude in his denominational politics.  I can see where the extreme rigidity comes from when he seeks to supress good, solid, Calvinist zealots in his own denomination, simply because they may have one or two very small differences with the Westminster Confession.<br />Anyway, I did read this book cover-to-cover and even bought a second copy for my church office.  I loved the topic, the orderliness of the book's arrangement, the Reformed theology, and the attractive packaging, but I found the scholarship to be extremely weak and the poor documentation to be very sad.	2001-03-14
US	52918265	RQKCQTPX9TRPC	0802482015	49493906	A Survey of Old Testament Introduction	Books	4	12	13	N	N	Excellent	After R.K. Harrison's work, clearly the second best OT Intro.  Very detailed, frank, lucid.  Perhaps a tad too combative at points.  Archer is one of the top OT scholars alive -- he has degrees from Princeton and Harvard and knows about 20 ancient languages.  He just shreds most of the critical arguments against the historical reliability of the Bible.	2001-03-14

Warfield was widely regarded as the most able conservative theologian of his generation in the English-speaking world.  He applies his characteristic Biblical thoroughness and clear-headed rigor to this topic, with very challenging results.  He changed my mind on several issues he addresses.  Overall, very good.	2001-03-14

Liberals tend to blame all poverty and need on oppression, conservatives blame laziness.  This book shows how the Biblical conception of the problem is far more sophisticated than either extreme.  Hard-thinking Biblical exegesis and practical application make this a truly wonderful book.  The author is organizing pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church (PCA) in Manhattan, which is known for its Reformed, Evangelical theology and commitment to mercy ministries.  It has planted something like a dozen churches (mostly ethnic or multi-ethnic) in the metro. area in the past 10 years.  Kellers knows how to operate faithful mercy ministries, in obedience to the Lord's charge to believers.  This is a GREAT book!	2001-03-14

Dr. Calhoun did his Th.M. and Ph.D. at Princeton and spent much of the next 15 years writing this history.  His mastery and passion for the subject really shows.  He is a very fine historian.  What is also obvious is his pastor's heart.  He is not afraid to give expansive quotes form the Old Princetonians which will move your heart to glorify God.  Honestly, one o fthe 5 or 10 bets books i have ever read.	2001-03-14

Books	4	42	65	N	Y	Evolutionists' Nightmare	One of the reviews posted on Amazon cryptically warns the reader to beware this book, because the writer is a *cleverly clothed Creationist.  Look into his background and judge for yourself.* Jonathan Wells background includes a Ph.D. from Yale in the history of science and another Ph.D. from U. Cal. Berkeley in cell biology.  He was also a 60s radical who paid a price for his public opposition to the VietNam conflict.<br />The evolutinary ideologues are terrified that a few scientists are voicing what so many are discovering -- the Darwinian emperor has no clothes.   We should applaud Wells for his honesty and bravery.	2001-01-29

He was also an avid and enthusiastic student of science, in keeping with his classic Reformed theological convictions and his Scottish Common  Sense philosophical commitments.  As Dr. Wells ably demonstrates, Hodge's  early critique of Darwinism was among the most sophisticated and thoughtful  of his generation.  <br />Given the recent progress of the anti-Darwinist  critiques, many of them following the same tragectory of Dr. Hodge's, this  remains an extremely relevant topic.  The scientific community is facing a  growing army, from a wide variety of theological and philosophical  backgrounds, who are bravely demonstarting that Emperor Darwin has no  clothes.  William Dembski, Michael Behe, Hugh Ross, and dozens of others  are really shaking things up.  This book, while an historical study, can  help you understand why.<br />Dr. Wells is uniquely qualified for the task.   He holds a Ph.D. in the history of science from Yale and another Ph.D. in  cell biology from Berkeley.  He's also a very fine writer.<br />This is a very  significant work.	1999-12-20

My wife and I began to use the sleeping program when our first son was seven weeks old and within three days he was sleeping through the night (7 hours at first, soon 9-plus hours straight).  Now he  is 6 months and has only awakened once in the night (he had a bad cold) in  the past 4 months!  Amazing.  He is happy and 99th percentile in height and  weight.  I know 15 couples who have tried Ezzo and only one disliked it  (they did so for political reasons).  I've become convinced that demand  feeding, family beds, child-centered homes, etc. are destroying our  children.	1999-11-04

Powlison is not a particularly sharp or polished writer.  Basically humorless, sometimes ponderous, nevertheless this is a truly  exceptional book.  Powlison (Ivy League Ph.D., ex-missionary, full-time  counsellor) has thought deeply about his subject and he makes an  unanswerable case.  His critique is compassionate, balanced, and generous.   Honestly, this is the most important book I have read all year.	1999-08-07
