To be truthful, I purchased this title during a layover in a New England airport, an act of unfettered desperation on my part.  I've owned this pile of you-can-figure-it-out for three weeks and I haven't finished reading it.  I can't--it's that much of a lullaby.  I'm guessing Amanda Quick was equally bored when she penned it, and frankly, for it to have made it to the shelves at the bookstore, someone at her publisher's was asleep at the wheel--no doubt the result of having read this book as well.  Do yourself a favor if you need something compelling to read--DON'T patronize any other book with the names Amanda Quick or Jayne Ann Krentz on the cover.  If you do, you won't be reading, you'll be SLEEPING. <br /> <br />	2005-05-13

This is potent, heady erotica.  I was profoundly affected by MJD's Love's Prisoner story, and I haven't been able to purge the urge to revisit it.  Although it touches on a VERY sensitive subject, it does so with consummate finesse, never straying from its intended purpose. It's the first time I've ever witnessed a writer handle this subject so deftly in a work of fiction, and for that alone MJD's accolades are very well earned.  <br /> <br />The other stories in this volume are also welcome diversions, but I don't reach for any compilation of erotic fiction if it doesn't have Mary Janice Davidson's name on the cover.  For my money, her work defines the standard. <br /> <br />This volume is worth the cover price for Love's Prisoner ALONE.  Buy it. <br /> <br />	2005-03-17

I was happy to find the text, as there are not many books on this subject in print.  But I didn't get the insight I was looking for.

The tale of a young columnist on an expedition through the rubble of her psyche to find herself, accompanied by a motley crew of friends, is nothing new (think Sex and the City).  That doesn't make this book any less entertaining.

Plus it's exciting to read about a super-hot man trying to expose the beautiful woman as a gold-digger while fighting his own attraction to her (and losing the fight!).

Though it lacked the fire of other titles I have read, it was hardly a letdown.  I loved the tortured protagonists, and the equally tortured antagonist.  I could have done without the whole \\"I-don't-want-my-title\\" bit.  Who cares?  And why, if Gentry refused his title, was it literally shoved down his gullet (as if he didn't have enough issues) anyway?  What moved me about the book was the way that Lottie vehemently took on the task of calming the waters of Nick's tormented soul, despite his half-hearted rebellion.  And I loved the sweet surrender--\\"It's too much...it feels to good to stop\\", Nick breathes into Lottie's ear.  YUMMY!  Some very palpable sexual tension permeates this book...<br />Now I have read some of Kleypas' other titles--Suddenly You, and Someone To Watch Over Me.  I liked this one the best of the three.  Though I stop short of calling this one a keeper, I definitely recommend the read.	2003-07-11

Let me put it this way: I was recommended this book because the person who passed it on to me believed it was the height of romantic suspense.  But I disagree.  There's only enough romance in the book to add a dimension to the story.  The story in and of itself is a riveting, can't-put-it-down kind of story, and for that Nora Roberts has earned well her accolades.  This title represents my introduction to the world of Nora Roberts, and I find I am in good company.  The author has a huge devoted following, and now I understand why.

This read is the epitome of hackneyed romantic literature--weak writing that inhibits a potentially inventive romantic premise.  This title amounts to dull, lifeless storytelling--NOT COMPELLING.  In fact, I couldn't find a single correlation between the story and its title.  Bolt's character turned out to be the only redeeming element of the entire story, the only reason (beyond the fact that I'd already paid for the book) to keep reading this drivel until the last page had been turned.  <br />I bought this title on a whim because I wanted to give other authors the time I've been reserving for Linda Howard, Christene Feehan and Susan Donovan, who have never failed to inspire me.  Jayne Ann Krentz (and her alter-ego Amanda Quick) have no less than 30 titles in the catalogue of the garden-variety book retailer--I thought, why not?  Now I have to wonder how she made it this far.  <br />Do yourself a favor--KEEP YOUR MONEY.	2003-06-30

Gray (Grayson) Rouillard is the alpha-male demi-god torn between his enmity for the family of Faith Devlin and his potent attraction to this very beguiling creature.  What happens when Faith returns to her hometown over a decade after being run out of town by the Rouillard clan is a 3-dimensional tale (involving some very imperfect, haunted and conflicted characters) that promises to keep you hooked until the last page.  The sexual energy is a very palpable part of the story that translates extremely well.  This one is a keeper.	2003-06-16

I knew her, knew him, empathised with their attraction to each other, and understood how the attraction translated to a real-live relationship.  Plus, the story in and of itself was exciting.  So Ms. Howard scores yet again.  I enjoyed this read--I think it would make a good screenplay for one of those LifeTime cable television movies.  Linda Howard is quickly becoming one of my favorite romantic authors.  I recommend 'Strangers in the Night' and 'Mr. Perfect' in addition to this one.	2003-05-09

Though all the stories earned merit, I was profoundly affected by Emma Holly's tale &quot;Luisa's Desire&quot;--the classic story of a man seduced from his holy calling by an irresistible temptation.  A very close second was Christine Feehan's potent tale &quot;The Awakening&quot;, about a man, his life mate, and their shape-shifting destiny in the rain forest.  You can count on Christine Feehan to always go to obscure depths to tell a good story.

I'm with Wolfy from Florida, who reviewed the Dark Hunter title.  This book introduced me to Christine Feehan and her Carpathian series.  I picked up the title on a whim while at the grocery store.  Once I opened the book, I couldn't put it down.  I was transferred to Italy, to the palazzo, to the cool and nurturing soil where Byron recharged each night, where I remained until the very last page of the story had been read.  And I could feel each instance of their passion as if I myself had been a participant.<br />I love the interplay between the alpha Byron and his independent life mate Antoinetta.  I love that she is Italian, but her name isn't Maria.  I love that his name is Byron.  I love the way they were constantly linked through telepathy.  I love how everything occurred in the dark of night.  I love how Byron's only mission in his life was to protect his beloved and her interests at any cost.  I love how Antoinetta had the courage to eventually allow herself to depend on the man she loved, and I love that he never let her down.<br />After reading this title I now view relationships in a different way.  Thank you, Ms. Feehan.  You go deep.  I am impressed.	2003-04-30

The primary female character wasn't nearly fleshed-out enough before she was thrown, rather unceremoniously, into bed with the primary male character.  Throughout the book it was as if I was perpetually reading an introduction to Grace Jenkins--I never got a chance to get to know her.<br />2. It seems as if the author took from something else she'd read a single theme that inspired her and turned it into a 150+ page thought, a thought that was underdeveloped (Ms. Foster tends to think faster than she types) and overdone.<br />3. The author's attempt at a unique storyline is evident here but never quite gets its wings and flies, being bogged down in trite rhetoric--tragic.<br />I purchased this book, and now want my money back.  I highly recommend Susan Donovan's &quot;Knock Me Off My Feet&quot; instead of this book any day of the week and twice on Sunday.	2003-04-08

Nevertheless, the comprehensive blurb for Libra is  extremely compelling, as is the astroanalysis, which details each and every  planet in each and every sign, and also provides an ascendant table and  corresponding analyses in the back.  Owning the book is a good idea because  you can go back and refer to its text when necessary.  Not only that, all  the chart work is done for you, so you need neither a computer nor an  ephemeris.  And Amazon's price is better than what I paid for it in the  bookstore.  I have recommended this book repeatedly, and even given others  of the series as gifts.  It is ultimately my goal to have one of these  books per sign for my very own; that's how good it is.  Highly recommended.	2000-06-07

I was given this book as a gift recently, and I'm still learning things from it.  I would like to express my gratitude to the individual  responsible for making a believer out of Celest Teal.  And Celest, don't  stop now--you're on a roll.	2000-05-24

This book is highly recommended for the astrology-illiterate. Enjoy!  And for you naysayers, I challenge you to read this book and not find something of yourself within its covers.	2000-05-19

Galenorn's writing technique is practical as well as intructional, which made the lessons in the book easy to learn.  I bought it for more  than its spells--I needed to feel someone understood what drew me toward  white magick to begin with, and I got that sense of empathy from the book.   It is, however, the first book on white magick I'd ever read from cover to  cover, so I haven't any others to which to compare it.	2000-05-16

It approaches the popular burden of finance from two perspectives and manages to make them work together with superior skill.  It also ably inspires the reader to create spells and  practices of their own.  Highly recommended.	2000-05-16
