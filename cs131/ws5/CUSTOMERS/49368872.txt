Since they are simply an example of a broader set of folks that fit in this niche I am sure it describes a group larger than, say, a million people. I am not sure how much larger a group it fits. I also suspect that in order to fit in this niche, to have a similar enough web of belief that there is sufficient family resemblance that in a language game about grand narratives, what counts for an individual in this niche must go through a lot of the philosophically \\"bad\\" questions to come to the conclusion that those were bad questions. We have to start simply, even if not as simply as Augustine might have described it. (So there should always be a market for that.)<br /><br />So if the topic is the future of religion we should note how small a market is at stake here. Baptists need not apply. There are books being written for larger audiences with titles like, \\"God's Politics : Why the Right Gets It Wrong and the Left Doesn't Get It\\" by Jim Wallis (number 135 on the Amazon list with 155 reviews compared to \\"The Future of Religion\\" (number 400,363 on the Amazon list with 5 reviews.) That comparison was just a shot in the dark.<br /><br />That being said, Rorty is right on target in describing a niche market I am familiar with and I appreciate the insights. As usual, Rorty says better than I could what I think I thought before I read it. Now I know I think it.<br /><br />Gianni Vattimo too is interesting: \\"\\"If \\"facts\\" thus appear to be nothing but interpretations, interpretation, on the other hand, presents itself as (the ) fact: hermeneutics is not a philosophy but the enunciation of historical existence itself in the age of the end of metaphysics.\\" (p. 45) I confess to being attracted to the book because of Rorty but now will be looking into Vattimo's \\"After Christianity\\".<br /><br />Zabala I found a little more difficult but perhaps that was just because he had the harder job to do.but perhaps that was just because he had the harder job to do. <br />	2005-10-10

I have since ordered and received, but not read, his book \\"Philosophy in the Flesh: The Embodied Mind and Its Challenge to Western Thought\\" which I think will be more along the lines of what I would consider properly academic. By this I mean that in \\"Don't Think\\" I noted that Lakoff uses the techniques he is talking about in order to frame political issues in the best interest of the \\"progressives\\" versus the conservatives \\"who are not stupid\\". It seems improper to me for an academic to take sides on an issue that he himself describes as a matter of linguistic framing. Lakoff does not support with argument that one frame should be supported and the other not, but appears to make that assumption with regard to the progressive frame. Another aspect of this book is that it is clear from the way Lakoff uses the frames he describes that he considers only the progressive frame to be true - at least he describes the statements associated or described by that frame to be the truth, yet there is no argument to suggest what would make one frame true and the other false. For those who are not using the right frame the truth just bounces off.<br /><br />But this much is clearly stated in the beginning of the book. Lakoff is not suggesting that we study cognitive science from an objective point of view. Strictly speaking from the frame of cognitive science an objective point of view could only be a subjective point of view! George is taking sides in order to help what he calls progressives to win against what he calls the conservatives, though note that he frames what those are in a way that would certainly be disputed by conservatives.<br /><br />I would hope academics would have as objective a view as possible from within a frame of reference. Many academics normally refer to frames as a metanarrative (Jameson and Lyotard or Rorty are examples of this.) It feels less desirable to have someone both teaching about framing from an academic point of view and clearly using one of those frames to frame framing. A greater value would be to teach from an objective point of view so students can be free to make up their own autonomous minds over which narrative if any should be viewed as the best. But certainly this would also teach that the objective value of the academic position is more powerful. It is, isn't it? As a result Lakoff feels like an academic only part of the time. Why describe the frames he develops as though only the progressive frame is the good one? Doesn't the value of the frame base itself on the narrative of the frame itself? To believe the values of a frame are correct means you are subject to the persuasiveness of that frame and unable to objectively value competing frames for their successes.academic point of view and clearly using one of those frames to frame framing.

I was not able to find the word for some reason and she lent me the book. (Sorry, my Greek is so very poor). For some reason with the book in hand I had no problems finding the word in my Liddell and Scott. I am most familiar with the Latin expression via negativa which is mentioned in the book. It was also interesting getting an overview of the Orthodox perspective via Timothy Ware.<br /><br />I also found reading the various reviews in amazon.com on the book interesting to see how different readers reacted to different parts of the book! There are some that give what I suppose are negative critiques from a certain point of view but positive from others. Considering the ecumenism towards which Churches are heading it seems merely silly to use negative critiques, but then some of those that are negative are from the view that the book is negative in light of the same movement towards ecumenism! How wonderfully enlightening to see so many sides of this issue all aroused by the book. This kind of interaction between readers is one of the most intriguing and useful things the Internet (and Amazon of course) has done for us. Thank you all for sharing your views!	2005-09-14

Even when the views of various philosophers are best understood through a realization of how they differ one from another, it can be very confusing trying to imagine how the different philosophical positions might amount to something practical. It is for that reason that I have selected Robert Nozick's little book The Examined Life to use in my class as an example of how a philosophical point of view can be used to address the practical aspects of life.<br /><br /> Nozick is fairly conservative. I might even be being conservative in describing him as \\"fairly\\" conservative depending on your viewpoint. He is often depicted as the conservative compared to the liberal John Rawls \\"Political Liberalism.\\" For the most part I feel my students are conservative and so feel there would be a good match. So far the feedback from my students has suggested to me that my choice has been right on the mark.<br /><br />While you can certainly read this text through from start to finish for my course I select different chapters to go with different topics in the main text for the course. Some chapters might make better sense if read in order.<br /><br />On Nozick on emotions: I suppose an awful lot of philosophy (one reason some mathematicians can't stand it) is a fight over how to properly use words in relation to one another. One mathematician I know likes to be very precise. Wittgenstein argued that most philosophical problems could be solved just by clearing up the language. Once we clarified our language we would see that the problems were pseudo problems - fake! But we don't use our words in clear ways especially when talking to lots of people who use language in different ways among themselves - some people will understand you one way and others another and still others won't understand a bit. I myself have had the fun of saying something only to be clearly understood by many people to have meant just the opposite of what I was intending to mean! But imagine what it would be like to try to get everyone to use words in exactly a certain way and no other. \\"Precising\\" definitions - well, I suppose that is what school is for! But is Nozick an authority? Actually, I prefer Damasio's use of \\"emotion\\" in \\"The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness -- by Antonio R.

Perhaps if it were the narrative surrounding a Jared Diamond like presentation based on his book \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" it might make it. But the main characters dialogue in monologue - since Ishmael speaks telepathically. Leaving out the science of this and what the \\"voice\\" would sound like it would not even be as action packed as \\"Mindwalk\\" http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6302670306/qid%3D1124758759/sr%3D11-1/ref%3Dsr%5F11%5F1/002-9410992-4542465 but my friend Paul writes that, \\"Ah, but it was: titled `Instinct' with Anthony Hopkins in 1999. Your final sentence jogged my memory (it's not completely gone) so I looked up Ishmael on IMDb which led me to Instinct (aka Ishmael). It has a good cast: besides Hopkins, there's Cuba Gooding jr. and Donald Sutherland. It's available on DVD and VHS. (Perhaps you should amend your review so you don't get into more trouble.)\\" Thanks Paul for the correction and I will look up the movie!<br /><br />I will always remember this book as having my wife miffed at me. Years ago when she bought the book and read it and suggested it to me I remember just thinking it was silly and ignored it but when a student told me about it and noted its relevance to something discussed in class I checked it out of the library that week and read it in two days - and then tried to interest my wife in it! At least now I am reminded we have our own copy and there are personal reasons why I will remember it.<br /><br />I found the book stimulating though I constantly thought of Jared Diamond's book, and his new one \\"Collapse\\", as well as Michael Crichton's book \\"State of Fear\\" as part of an ongoing conversation. I would not consider this book as marking a significant point for me such that I will think of the books I have read as \\"divided into two categories - the ones I read before Ishmael and those read after\\" as one reviewer comments. Apart from using the rhetorical device of the gorilla with some narrative set up for this, the book is an argument and the argument is one sided. The narrative suggests that Ishmael's teaching is news and just on hearing it the reader should be convinced and shocked by how unobservant the reader was earlier and now realizes the truth of what Ishmael says. Granted this book was written in the early 90's but it seems much of this view was certainly well in vogue. \\"Silent Spring\\" comes to mind. But the main issue for me concerns the dichotomy between \\"takers\\" and \\"leavers\\". While we have all met those who would fit easily into one or the other category, as with most, if not all, categories, they seem artificially constructed and merge into one another. So in some respects these two categories merge into one another as well. Still it often seems people are no wiser than bacteria in a yogurt container and will reproduce and toxify the environment until it kills all the bacteria- or the people. Some of the suggestions for avoiding this are interesting but seem certainly presented in a sad way - because of a forgone conclusion. It was interesting to see there are groups using the book.<br /><br />I also wonder about the rabbi's insight that the gorilla is \\"Not Goliath\\".

He contrasts what turn out to be significant shifts in emphasis in the way we do politics especially from after the civil war that shows voter apathy is not something new.

Carleton has clearly done a fantastic job keeping up with recent scientific developments and uses this to critique the narrative of what we might call fundamental Protestantism. As a complement to this quest two books immediately jump to mind (both of which are in the bibliography) How We Believe : Science, Skepticism, and the Search for God (second edition) by Michael Shermer, and Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought by Pascal Boyer. This book follows the basic position taken in those two books.<br /><br />In reading the bibliography to get an idea what the book offers I note that certain names I expect to find to address narrative construction issues I find most intriguing, that includes those names associated with the linguistic turn and the \\"prison house of language\\" are not in this bibliography. These include names such as Hegel, Wittgenstein and Rorty. This aspect central to postmodern narrative construction is not part of the approach.<br /><br /> As a result the book is interesting but the author misses something important. This is evident in the very description of the issues brought up. For example, Carleton explains he is an ex-Catholic and why. This strikes me as defining Carleton as a fundamentalist scientist doing philosophy. By chapter 4 this is even more convincing. Carleton is a scientific fundamentalist in the sense that he is applying contemporary science to revise the narratives from which we traditionally derive our values in much the same way that others have without the insights that come from the linguistic turn. This approach ignores the nature of language, language games, and narrative construction - I am thinking of examples such as Wittgenstein and Quine in this respect, though the whole movement from Hume through Kant and Hegel which sets up the linguistic turn are important. If Carleton would consider the nature of what he is constructing from the standpoint of language analysis and narrative construction, and so recognize \\"the prison house of language\\" within which he is working this would come to a better end. An excellent example of how this point would change the outcome concerns Carleton's use of the metaphor of the solar system and the geo-centered system as the typical icon of progress. Yet relativity gives us the view of both of these as mirror image models both useful in different contexts - they are different perspectives on the same thing, while Einstein gives us still another view, both earth and sun are traveling in a straight line while space is curved, and there are still others each of which are useful for certain purposes. The paradigm of relativity when applied across the board, especially when it comes to knowledge and what can be known, would lead to a more successful narrative I think. An example of a scientist that does do this is Stuart Kauffman. (See Investigations by Stuart A. Kauffman) This is important since remaining a skeptic strikes me as a very uncomfortable place to be - I think of Hegel's description of the \\"unhappy consciousness\\" in this regard. Einstein and Godel both viewed things from their paradigm in a way that led to better things. (See Incompleteness by Rebecca Goldstein for a wonderful description of this.)

Over the last year or so I have read the Harry Potter Books and watched the movies. I listen to the music on the soundtrack CDs while working. It sets a nice mood for me. Why?<br /><br />There has been a flurry of writing over the issue of why Potter has been such a hot item. Why do children like to read the books? We have their quotes to read over and think about. Some declare reading them has pulled them away from the abyss and toward success. Adults ponder these issues and offer various reasons why they think they have been so popular with children. Better, they also ponder why the books have been popular with adults as well. Notice that Lady JKR says she wrote the books for herself, because she liked them.<br /><br />Some have detailed the perfect fit the stories have with the trends in political and economic aspects of British or American society. Others have described the wonderful use the plots make of classic templates that always win hearts and imaginations. Harry is Jesus made flesh. Those who see a satanic cultus have been pretty much laughed out of town or they live in towns most laugh at.<br /><br />We also have the interplay with public relations and the media. Lady JKR received good PR even prior to the first publication of HPP/SS. The news media were interested in the poor single mother making good. It was like magic. Scholastic bid high for the rights in America and that meant a burden was on them to produce fans. They did a good job. But of course, the book was good in its own right. The movie stuck to the text, so to speak. One thing AOL did right. The kids would have been disappointed otherwise. Now when we read we picture things according to the film for better or worse. Frankly, I could never have imagined the delivery of lines such as, \\"It does not do Harry to dwell on dreams and forget to live.\\" as well as Richard Harris did. Bless him. The irony of it hurts, but it sounds like good advice and one reason to dwell on someone else's dream when it delivers such wonderful insights.<br /><br />With so many enjoying the books each for their own reasons, it makes little sense to think there is a peculiarly important reason why the books have enjoyed the overwhelming success they have. There are lots of reasons.<br /><br />I do not want the story to stop. It bugged me that I had to wait until June to see the last movie and even longer to find out what happens to Harry next. Book 6 is scheduled to come out July 16, 2005 and my order for it is already placed. But I know I have to be patient. I don't want JKR to feel rushed. I want her to do the job right all the way to the word \\"scar.\\"<br /><br />When I received my order for HPCS, as a side note, I puzzled over this recent development of ordering things before they are published. I have had outstanding orders for about four of five things that have not come out yet. This never used to be the case, at least for me. So this is some new kind of economic development in its own right. I suspect computers had something to do with this. And credit.<br /><br />I would love to teach at Hogwarts. Imagine! Students studying. Reading assignments and papers done. Students working at the library. (I seriously think Snape is the best teacher there). Reading books after class on school grounds. Students getting along well in their own houses at least. Competition between houses is a good stressor. Teachers get to teach what they consider important and they don't have to worry so much about their popularity. They can be as strict as they want. In fact, if they are not good enough or strict enough they can lose their positions!<br /><br />No more casual clothes. Discipline is the order of the day. All you need to do is deduct points or give detentions, even if those are no longer hanging bythe thumbs in the dungeons; they are amazingly effective at Hogwarts. Students really behave.

How would that work?<br /><br />But I think the reason I would want to teach there is not just the castle and its peculiarities. It's the quality of the students. They are smart and interested.

It describes the overall perspective modern psychological theory provides. There is some historical presentation of post-Kantian psychological schools and personality theories but above all these are presented with an aim to guide behavior in ways most likely to lead to success. Sections focus on work-related attitudes, problem solving including group problem solving and using psychological theory to improve communication. This book helps students understand how contemporary theory enables greater autonomy through understanding how motivation can be controlled by others allowing individuals more control over their own motivation.

It bothers me to think - and it should not - that there are people that lived in a war torn intellectually inhospitable place speaking English as a second language that none the less have read more of the important books in English literature than I have. From the discussions I know too that they have been provoked to thinking by reading them and discuss them in ways that demonstrate a volume and depth of reading that seems like Tehran under the yoke of the fundamentalist Shariah law which banned books and closed book shops - how then do they find them as assigned readers in University classes? - still has young college students that know more about good English literature than I do. And so that they even give some sort of succor to those in prison - as James does?<br /><br />This book reminds me of the history of Iran that I experienced from far away - some of it while I lived in Berlin.

Will this happen in other places? -- to my own daughters? How would you prepare your daughters for something like this? Could this happen here in my community?<br /><br />p. 241 - \\"At times our lives were more fictional than fiction itself.\\"<br /><br />I do feel like I am missing a lot because of the way the book is presented. It is an engaging dialogue with the women in her book group over the texts they are reading and how they interpret those, including comparisons with their own experiences. This is where we get our insights into the situation in Iran. Both the situation in Iran and the engaging discussions are interesting in their own right and I wish to have more continuity in both but the interplay between the two - making the book more interesting - is also frustrating. Time jumps forward and back. Certainly some things can not be clearer for fear it would still endanger those individuals portrayed - if they are real people, and I assume they are. Some people are killed by the regime for crimes that seem less than what these women are doing in the book and getting away with. How does that happen? It is also hard to imagine still feeling the loyalty to the country when this kind of oppression occurs.

It starts off by basically suggesting the reason jokes are hard to remember is because people do not work hard enough to remember them. He then starts off by telling a joke that is not worth remembering. Certainly it is not one I can imagine using any place. So if my problem is I do not work hard enough to remember it - by repeating it soon enough, this is clearly one I wish I could forget. It took until the fourth joke to find one worth remembering - that I could tell in polite company at any rate! (The Missing Music). Finally another good one shows up: \\"The Farmer's House of Sod.\\" But boy I had to weed through a lot of poor jokes to get to that one! OK, \\"The Hunchback's Replacement\\" is not too bad. \\"The Tate Compass\\" is alright. The rest are pretty bad. Now to remember these.... If you want a joke book with most of the classic bad jokes, this is it.<br /><br />One point of agreement: people remember stories. But then how to use this in the context of telling jokes? A better way to remember jokes is to think of them as arguments that are fallacious. There are different kinds of fallacies and we can easily remember those. Now you are ready to make your own jokes. Take a fallacious argument and use the form of that argument to make an argument that is clearly meant to be fallacious. For example, a pun is equivocation. Use a word in two different senses in either two premises or a premise and the conclusion of an argument and you have a fallacious equivocal argument. Have the conclusion of an argument have nothing to do with the premises of the argument and you have a non sequitur. Dave Barry uses this fallacy all the time.	2005-06-14

This was a fast read for me since Amazon managed to just get it to me in time to read for my book group's last meeting before we quit for the summer! But it was also fast because even when I had to stop reading it to do something - I was still thinking about it and wondering what was going to happen next. So there was no \\"ho-hum\\" about this book - just another book group selection I never would have picked out for myself. Not this one. Still, each book the book group picks that I would never have thought of or read on my own has touched me in a way that I find one of the main reasons I love being in my book group. But this one was really different. Was it because it is a contemporary voice from such a place? Perhaps. When all of a country I know from seeing horrible footage of bombed out villages and impoverished people, reading about a boy growing up in a house with four bathrooms and a nicer bicycle than I ever had is interesting. This book is a window into the minds and culture of a people I have not met before. No sin of \\"Spoiling the End\\" here but some of my favorites: At one point a driver tells the main character, Amir, that he was always a tourist in his own country. This would change once the driver found out why Amir was back. But you still have the impression that only the poor in Afghanistan were the true Afghanis. By implication am I not considered a citizen by the poor in my own country or is this a unique point of view in such a collapsed state? (I am remembering here Jared Diamond's \\"Collapse\\" and worried about our own future here - or anywhere.)  By being wealthy and isolated from the travails of impoverishment a person is not a native in their own country? What an interesting comment and it is taken almost, it seems, as though it were a fair assessment. What would that mean? Imagine not being a citizen of the world because you could afford to feed your children - and even buy them a kite. On adoption (a particular critical issue for me since my wife and I have adopted our four children who are our greatest treasure and gift to other people): I beg to disagree with General Taheri that anyone should be so different that adoption is out of order even if there is no relation by blood. \\"Blood is very powerful.\\" My favorite line: \\"lifting him from the certainty of turmoil and dropping him in a turmoil of uncertainty.\\" But this is blood. Are we Meme Machines (Susan Blackmore) and passing on our meme complexes more important than passing on our genes? I hope so.<br /><br /> So the book teaches about other people I know little about, is thought provoking, and a good read. What more could you ask for in a book? My only critique is the horror. But could it have done the same things it does without it? I do not know.r me since my wife and I have adopted our four children who are our greatest treasure and gift to other people): I beg to disagree with General Taheri that anyone should be so different that adoption is out of order even if there is no relation by blood. \\"Blood is very powerful.\\" My favorite line: \\"lifting him from the certainty of turmoil and dropping him in a turmoil of uncertainty.\\" But this is blood.

There is an emphasis on one aspect of Saint Augustine's discussion about time that is interestingly used by Fox to voice agreement with contemporary physics and find it fits with dreamtime a la Aboriginal Australian. Since I prefer the view by Roger Penrose (see his version of Strong C in \\"The Large, the Small and the Human Mind\\") I find this interpretation interesting but different than my preferred. Still we end up with \\"Dreamtime itself is right here now.\\" (p. 14) Fox also discovers that native Americans believe \\"God does not make evil spirits; we humans do, and our human institutions do.\\" Considering this is the point of original sin according to Saint Augustine I am surprised that Fox finds this view surprising. Perhaps it would be surprising to find a people with no apparent cultural affiliation with Saint Augustine (is that possibly the case?) could have a similar view with one of the fundamental perspectives associated with Christian theology - but that does not seem to be the point Fox makes here. The point made next that the \\"only avenue by which an evil spirit can enter the human heart is fear\\" (p. 15) is contrary to Augustine's \\"pride\\". Regardless, it seems inappropriate to set a conceptual limit on what could be such an \\"avenue\\".  The critique on p. 15 that Descartes thought only humans had souls - that other animals treated philosophically by Descartes led to the behaviorist view - misses an important suggestion that Descartes intended his more intelligent readers to apply this to humans as well without clearly coming into conflict with the Church's view on the soul - a program that if meant was clearly fulfilled by the likes of B. F. Skinner!<br /><br />On the article by Macy: reading this after having read Jared Diamond's new book \\"Collapse\\" is a very poignant experience. This article refers to events in 1989. The thesis is \\"Waking Up\\" and in retrospect this seems like something we have yet to do with the sort of seriousness that might make a real difference.<br /><br />On the article by Brady: \\"Called by the Land to Enter the Land\\" this bemoans the continuing rape of Australia by the recent emigrants in the face of the 40,000 year natives who coexisted with her for all that time. The call is a call \\"to conversion, to a change in our way of living\\".<br /><br />On the article by Treston: \\"Living in a Unitary Age\\" seems a restatement of Globalization. This seems interestingly related to Thomas Friedman's new book \\"The World is Flat\\".<br /><br />On the article by Cain: \\"Sacred Origins\\" draws a focus on Symbol and story.<br /><br />On the article by Kneebone: \\"An Aboriginal Response\\"!

This selection of the key writings presents the evolution of Wittgenstein from the Tractatus to his later works. It enables students to experience doing philosophy and moving from one stage to another and another in a practical way. It corresponds well to reflective thinking stages and helps demonstrate the philosophical succession that leads to our contemporary position on truth, beauty and goodness.

Since I chose Quine's \\"Web of Belief\\" and the Kenny Reader on Wittgenstein for the section on Truth, so that students can engage the contemporary issues associated with truth from an overall perspective and actually do philosophy via the extraordinarily subversive energy of Wittgenstein's questions, the Sheppard text fits perfectly as the text that frames the issues over aesthetics in a way that demonstrates the lessons learned from the first two books. This is also short enough to cover the main issues quickly so that there is time left for goodness at the end of the course!	2005-05-19

I recall reading \\"Congo\\" and enjoying that and I enjoyed the movie \\"Jurassic Park\\" - so I figured it would be a pleasant read. The reason for the encouragement was because, I presume, the thesis of the book horrified my colleague who has done a great deal of work regarding the effects of global warming. Here is a book written by an author that has a proven track record of being popular - this book is clearly written in a style that has \\"make me a movie\\" all over it. It is loaded with sex, violent action, and stupidity - the kind of stupid characterizations that leave you sitting there annoyed with the character who doesn't see coming what you do. So this book is going to have a lot of impact. But what does it teach? Whether it is clearly C's view that global warming is a politicized fiction intended to fill the fear vacuum left by the collapse of the Soviet threat or not - I am at least under the impression that C really just feels we do not know enough about the nature of nature to be certain enough to know what we are talking about - is he certain there is too much certainty in the world? Does he really feel we should stop trying our best to know as much as we can and act on that? It does seem that he seriously interprets the data collected to indicate that we are having little impact on the weather and that organizations using fear mongering tactics are more often than not liable to make things worse than better - and for a worse reason than just ignorance. They do it to make money and grow competitively against other organizations regardless of the damage they cause. In this book radical environmentalists are the enemy. They are deliberately setting up catastrophes in order to stimulate public investment in their organizations. These folks are evil. Does that not leave us with the impression that environmentalists might really be like that in some ways? At least some of them?<br /><br />But I know many scientists and they are not like that. They seriously are concerned about the environment and do not have much to gain financially by their efforts - publishing academic books and teaching are not really that profitable after all.

US	49368872	R1CVWBJ1IEBZK5	1555423566	861114483	Developing Critical Thinkers: Challenging Adults to Explore Alternative Ways of Thinking and Acting	Books	4	5	7	N	N	A good review of practice	This book takes the approach of viewing critical thinking as reflective thinking starting off with a recognition of the narrative elements considered axiomatic by the adult being taught to think critically. There is no first emphasis on thinking correctly, so it is to be assumed that logical skills are already something the adult student has learned. Since it has been my experience over 10 years teaching adults and late adolescents that our school systems in general do not prepare people to think correctly (that is Logic 101) this should be a first issue in a text meant to be used in a Logic and Reasoning course in college. As a result I would not recommend this text as a requirement for a Logic and Reasoning course or as an Introduction to Logic course but perhaps as a book for a course like Truth, Beauty, and Goodness where it might do well as the first book dealing with the nature of truth.<br /><br />As a description of this approach B quotes Boyd and Fales as saying that reflective learning is \\"the process of internally examining and exploring an issue of concern, triggered by an experience, which creates and clarifies meaning in terms of self, and which results in a changed conceptual perspective\\". (p. 14) Part 1 of the book describes this process. In this section the book assumes the adults are already conceiving of reality as socially constructed (at least \\"to some extent\\"). (p. 17) Descriptions of examples do not fit metanarrative conflict but instead reevaluation of basic assumptions within the context of a narrative. The phases of critical thinking are described in much the typical pattern but there is a nice section on the role of \\"helpers\\" - \\"psychological demolition experts\\". (p. 30) Dewey gets credit here. Much of the book is a who's who is saying what on this subject so it is more for instructors than students.<br /><br />In chapter 3 critical thinking of this sort is promoted as a way of escaping the confines of our uncritical points of view. I like this phrase \\"authentic frameworks of understanding\\". (p. 47) Chapter 4 is titled \\"How Critical Thinking Sustains a Healthy Democracy.\\" I have a sneaking suspicion reading this that B would be most comfortable as a Unitarian Universalist.<br /><br />Part 2 is titled \\"Practical Approaches for Developing Critical Thinkers\\". I like the role play section but found most of this fairly routine considering I use it every day. It reminds me of parts of Pascarella and Terenzini's \\"How College Affects Students\\" and it surprises me not to find them in the references. Part 3 applies these to different areas of adult life. Chapter 8 deals with the workplace. Chapter 9 is interesting in dealing with politics since it is more carefully done than I would have suspected. There is no side taking other than the encouragement to critical thinking about political issues.<br /><br />Who does B read?

The one denies us a unique world, the other the common stuff of which worlds are made. Together these theses defy our intuitive demand for something solid underneath, and threaten to leave us uncontrolled, spinning out our own inconsequent fantasies.\\" (...) \\"Truth, far from being a solemn and severe master, is a docile and obedient servant. The scientist who supposes that he is single-mindedly dedicated to the search for truth deceives himself. He is unconcerned with the trivial truths he could grind out endlessly; and he looks to the multifaceted and irregular results of observations for little more than suggestions of overall structures and significant generalizations. He seeks system, simplicity, scope; and when satisfied on these scores he tailors truth to fit. He as much decrees as discovers the laws he sets forth, as much designs as discerns the patterns he delineates.\\" (...) MY notes: this seems to exhibit the influence of the later Wittgenstein. There are several quotes to this effect. \\"...while readiness to recognize alternative worlds may be liberating, and suggestive of new avenues of exploration, a willingness to welcome all worlds builds none. ... A broad mind is no substitute for hard work.\\" (p. 21) From the footnote on (...): \\"Even though a metaphorical statement may be literally false, metaphorical truth differs from metaphorical falsity much as literal truth differs from literal falsity.\\"  Chapter III is an interesting discussion of the nature of quotation which could come in handy during discussions of plagiarism. Chapter V - the puzzle about perception seems to deal with issues contemporary brain science has better answers for. But VI - The Fabrication of Facts looks like a good chapter. \\"...we must distinguish falsehood and fiction from truth and fact; but we cannot, I am sure, do it on the ground that fiction is fabricated and fact found.\\" (...)

Imagine growing up in a social milieu where Hegel (the colossal Hegel) was the philosophical common sense view! So much so that he becomes a backdrop for a childish play. \\"Now I have finished, and with Hegel world history is concluded. Just take me away because now there is nothing left but mythology and I myself will become a mythological figure.\\" (p. 84) But there is no solution offered to the question of whether K studied Hegel directly or only through local sources (p. 86). My comment: If he did read Hegel he was either joking or did not understand - though it is a good question what it might mean to say anyone understood Hegel in this - but hence G's point that if K was Hegelian he was irreverent. Marx and K are attending Schelling's lectures (p. 209) and K, by the second lecture says, \\"Now I have put all my hope in Schelling.\\" (p. 210) But not for long - well 41 lectures might be long! But no wonder he treated Hegel \\"with breathtaking impertinence.\\" (p. 336) So the polemics seem to target the pomposity of the lecturing style and this bio does not engage the philosophical issues as does say, the Pinkard \\"Hegel\\".	2005-03-17

This is examined in light of Kantian views and the author points out the similarities - something I do not recall reading about before. I was under the impression that Wittgenstein was relatively unschooled philosophically. So seeing his views described as Kantian is exciting. \\"Wittgenstein's position can quite properly be described as idealist, in a sense closely analogous to that in which Kant's was.\\"  (P. 17) F contrasts his view (the diversity thesis) with that of Bernard Williams (may he rest in peace) and others, and in agreement with Norman Malcolm, on the interpretation of the later Wittgenstein's position on the \\"I\\" and the \\"We\\". (p. 24) So, the examples described here do not lead to the negative view that the alternatives given are unintelligible but rather that they are \\"either actual or possible.\\" \\"In short, grammar is neither correct nor incorrect, neither true nor false, but is instead antecedent to correctness and incorrectness, truth and falsehood.\\" (p. 48) Why does W hold this view? F says because \\"grammatical principles ... are rules or conventions, like those which govern games, that they have somewhat the character of commands, commandments, or categorical imperatives with which we enjoin ourselves to order our empirical or factual claims in specific ways.\\" (p. 49) In some sense grammatical principles are non-arbitrary since they are \\"required to be useful.\\" (p. 81) Chapter 4 deals with some criticisms.  Part II of the book deals with the \\"diversity thesis.\\"	2005-03-10

I recommended it as a counter book to another's suggestion that we read (another) Shermer book: \\"The Science of Good and Evil\\". I was hoping that our next fundamentalist scientist book would be a Dawkins selection instead but \\"The Selfish Gene\\" was out of the question -- maybe Unweaving would have been a good choice. The group loved it when he came down hard on religion -- organized and disorganized. In general the group thought the various pieces on fellow scientists were filler though I always like seeing a bit of the personal side of authors I like -- to get a better idea of why I like them. I apologize for not even being aware of the passing of Gould. That felt really wrong since I am also reading \\"I Have Landed\\".<br /><br />I am sure the book went over better than another Shermer book would have and some loved it. I recommend it for book and discussion groups and some articles might do for a good classroom discussion as well.

I bet the algorithm is the same. Just the data base is different.	2005-02-22

Rock (what is Rock exactly?) does not come off very well. Compare Charles Murray \\"Human Accomplishment\\" on music. I ask a class, \\"Name the greatest woman composer.\\" \\"Greatest woman mathematician?\\" This prompts and interesting discussion.<br /><br />Are contemporary students getting a good education? If we frame this debate with Bloom, Neil Postman, Mark Edmundson, and Genrich Krasko all on one side, who do we have on the other? There are plenty of folks bemoaning the quality of liberal arts education in our schools. But I think another argument can be made to suggest that what our schools prepare students for is what they really need to be prepared for to survive in the world as they find it. Perhaps it is wrong to think very many people need a liberal education - a good one at least. Imagine the task of working in Wal-Mart after receiving a good liberal education? Wouldn't that be worse? \\"Expecting Deltas to know what liberty is! And now expecting them to understand Othello!\\" Not 1984 but a Brave New World. Soma anyone? But there are plenty of liberal arts students that are wonderful! Don't we always have more candidates that are qualified than positions for them? Plato's suggestion that an ideal state would be just when it fit the nature of the people in it. We are not amusing ourselves to death. Virtual life is soma.<br /><br />Update after the Oscar was awarded to \\"It is hard to be a pimp\\" -- this was perfect timing for my class.

The author is in favor of  `positive discrimination' on behalf of black students in order to treat them the same as white students who \\"have a hidden subsidy when they enter the classroom.\\" P. 5 Madan then goes on to offer practical advice on specific sorts of problems, such as students using derogatory names or telling racist jokes. From there he goes on to discuss other teachers and curriculum issues. In chapter three different models of multiracial education are discussed. In discussing the sociology of race relations he critiques those that feel blacks do not have a positive view of themselves by arguing \\"One of the reasons that some black people do not have high aspirations is not that they are not capable of realizing them but because they reject many of the expectations and values of white society.\\" P. 21 He concludes chapter 2 saying, \\"Racism is inherent in all institutions of the state.\\" p.26 In chapter 3 he argues that the approaches made so far are \\"reformism\\" \\"a political position which amounts to changing one small thing - so that everything else can remain the same.\\" p. 27 He repeats several times that \\"black people know exactly who they are - their problems are not to do with self-image and identity but with exploitation and oppression.\\" p. 32<br /><br />In chapter 4 he points out that \\"the introduction of `Black Studies' and teaching methods based on (phenomenological sociology with its stress on individual meaning and subjective experience) ...may actually increase educational inequality through their emphasis on mental health goals ... at the expense of academic achievement.\\" p. 35 In this section Madan reminds me of some of Walter Williams comments regarding the same sorts of thing in the US. \\"The question arises whether MRE represents  anything more than a misguided liberal strategy to compensate black children for not being white.\\" p. 36<br /><br />In chapter 5 the issue is knowledge. Madan voices interest in a Marxist view of knowledge and schooling. While not explicitly accepting the view that \\"the educational system (is not a) means by which social inequality may be overcome, but as a means by which it is perpetuated\\" (p. 47) he does support that view. The same approach is taken in chapter 6 with regard to white feminism and black women. Chapter 7 brings the attention to black youth and unemployment. \\"Youth training schemes are ...a means of social control (and) attempts to discipline working class youth.\\" (p. 75) The various issues are summarized in chapter 9 and then chapter 10 discusses beginnings ... how to use compulsory teacher training to remove racism from the curriculum and society. This seems to be just the opposite view that Dinesh takes in \\"The End of Racism.\\"<br /><br />It is fascinating to me to compare Madan and his work with that of Dinesh D'Souza (one of my favorite authors). While Madan is writing in the UK, Dinesh writes in the USA (both are originally from India). A comparison of their work seems to suggest, at least within the scope of their experience, that MRE is much better in the USA then in the UK.<br /><br />If this was so, then I have no doubt Madan's book was timely though I doubt it was as effective as he hoped.anything more than a misguided liberal strategy to compensate black children for not being white.\\" p. 36<br /><br />In chapter 5 the issue is knowledge.

There is the Thoreau narrative, changed to meet the environment, but none the less a very straight forward life in harmony with nature complete with all the good and bad. This is lovingly described and you can tell it has been lived. You live it vicariously courtesy of Seth putting you there through the eyes of Cutuk, a child, then youth, then teen - so yes it is a coming of age book. But there is also a glimpse of another narrative that plays well against the Thoreau narrative and that is the Enuk narrative - subsistence hunting, sophisticated but aboriginal, primal and spiritual. Both are furiously run over by snow machines and automatic rifles, alcohol and TV - the narrative of technological progress. Ordinary wolves do not stand a chance. But the ordinary wolves that are hunted down to near extinction are not just the wild wolves on the tundra, but the wolves that hunt them. Ordinary hunters are intoxicated and destroyed by the technology that destroys their prey and their hunting and escape from the tragic in one way or another is the desperate result. We have the advantage of seeing the death of the primal hunter through the eyes of an educated Cutuk even as we share Cutuk's primal vision of where the narrative of technological progress is taking everyone. We are all ordinary wolves.	2004-11-02

There was little chance to add 2 + 2 during the events. How much clearer everything becomes when so much material is put together in a thoughtful way and points out where people went wrong in the moment. I have become interested in reading more reports if they are as well done as this. Once again, the members of my book group get me to read something I never would have read otherwise, but the experience was well worth it.	2004-10-18

It reads like a conversation manual for the worst sort of people who think they are liberals. For those who study foreign languages you know what sort of headache you get after spending too much time with the foreign vocabulary. I suppose if you practice this vocabulary long enough it might become second nature - or worse, in which case any pretense towards a subjectively objective point of view is lost. Beware the adjectives that make even \\"compliments\\" derogatory. Even the idea that anyone is a \\"sore\\" winner demonstrates this. Note that this is not only a technique or practice used against specific individuals, such as POTUS, but even works on things such as \\"faith-based\\" social programs. Example: \\"The basic problem with \\"faith-based\\" social programs is that, although well-meaning, they often become a pretext for gutting government programs while putting nothing in their place.\\" (p. 39) Consider the first assumption that there is a \\"basic problem\\" with \\"faith-based\\" social programs, and that they might be \\"well-meaning\\" but become a \\"pretext\\" for \\"gutting\\". (No mention of Charles Murray's \\"Losing Ground\\" and the serious conclusion that government social welfare programs make things worse and they should go back to the control of \\"faith-based\\" institutions that do a good job - so of course government is not going to put anything in their place. Why replace failure with more of the same?) As a contrast, the adjectives used to describe Osama bin Laden are often positive - \\"he wasn't just a high priest of holy war, he was a princely financier.\\" (p. 64) We also get a dose of adjectives that describe human character in a way that reflects a distinct difference from conservative or educated liberal language: \\"Any child can understand why a man might want to be so powerful that he could grab all the treasure, bed any woman he fancies, and build monuments to himself.\\" (p. 66) (Shouldn't we be raising our children so that they would not understand this?)

As with the previous book doing the same with \\"The Simpson's\\" Pinsky demonstrates the challenge of looking into a movie and searching for the moral narrative that can be interpreted as the coherent logical paradigm that holds the elements of the movie together. These are the aspects that teach the audience values. Pinsky points out the value in doing this kind of analysis. If we are using these movies to entertain and teach then we should examine them to see what those values are. It is very easy to watch and enjoy a movie without ever thinking about the moral teachings the movie imparts. A point to make is that all movies project such moral narratives since that is the glue that holds the elements together. We should practice this type of analysis on all the movies we watch. Through the powerful educational tool of modern movies, movie makers educate millions of people. We should follow Pinky's lead and concentrate on what they are teaching us.	2004-09-30

Lewis and Sigmund Freud Debate God, Love, Sex, and the Meaning of Life	Books	5	1	6	N	N	Would this be good for students with angst?	It seems to me the main point of this book is the concern Nicholi has with students who experience the depression associated with belief in the narrative exemplified by Freud. By using C. S. Lewis as the opposing argument there is a clear advantage in selecting a powerful writer who has also experienced the depression associated with belief in the \\"materialist\\" narrative. There are some problems with this though since the presentation of Lewis in many places appears to picture his narrative as the illusory fundamental narrative Freud stands against. Since Freud's view represents a stage of development or maturity most students should reach during their education, reading Lewis in this simplified way may offer an illusory sense of retreat into error instead of a grasp of the more complex Platonic, or Augustinian, perspective that can be read in Lewis. This is the more powerful view that sheds the depression and brings back the \\"Joy\\" after having been through the loss of our simple picture of the world. Lewis can overcome the narrative that leads to such a sad view of the world but it can only do this when it is clearly more encompassing and inclusive and not in conflict with a scientific fundamentalism. The contrast between Freud and Lewis can clearly demonstrate the value in the claim that a little education is a dangerous thing. The overwhelming education of Lewis can be quite the cure if used correctly.	2004-08-24

While it certainly is an important, interesting book on philosophy, it offers little as a philosophy text book. But over the years I have found lots of opportunities to refer to it in class as a resource.<br />Some specific things I find come up frequently:<br />1. The concept of the sociological cogito -- this strikes me as a wonderful way of applying Augustine, via Descartes' cogito via Leibniz, Hegel, Wittgenstein (private language argument) to interest the class on what we know for certain. It was the first I saw the argument presented this lucidly.<br />2. Applying the template of social networks to the development of ideas - and this I connect to current complex systems work such as Kennedy's Swarm Intelligence. I love passing the book around so everyone can see the network charts.<br />3.  The relationship between points of view moving through intellectual space following standard patterns, much as Hegelian dialectic describes, but in easier terms.<br />4. Since I also routinely discuss sociologizing sociology, it certainly is fair that I discuss sociologizing philosophy as well.<br /><br />There is a disappointment: the book stops. Understood, the effort would have been a tremendous one as the information explosion changes the patterns. But this is precisely the concern. What changes with the information explosion? We did not have to touch Quine to be strongly influenced though meeting him was certainly an event to be remembered. This is an approach I would like to see explored further.	2004-08-20

It can be pleasurable reading in the target language something the student already \\"knows\\" since that will save dictionary look-up time and there will be a pleasure of discovery in figuring out the previously unknown word for oneself.<br />My regards to the effort involved in this project.

Black offers a wealth of insights as, for example, the following quotations and remarks:<br />p. 2 \\"Don't worry about what you have already written. Just keep on beginning to think afresh as if nothing at all had happened yet\\" (Notebooks, 30 (6)).<br />p. 3 \\"The baldest summary of Wittgenstein's conception might run as follows: Reality (`the world') is a mosaic of independent items - the `atomic facts'; each of these is like a chain in which `objects' (logical simples) `hang in one another'; the objects are connected in a network of logical possibilities (`logical space'); the simplest `elementary' propositions are pictures of atomic facts, themselves facts in which names are concatenated, and all other propositions are truth-functions of the elementary ones; language is the great mirror in which the logical network is reflected, `shown', manifested. If we add the notions of names deputizing for objects, of logical propositions as limiting cases of contingent propositions, and the pervasive notions of logical form and of essence, we shall have a serviceable list of Wittgenstein's chief leitmotifs.\\"<br />p. 7 \\"It was one of Wittgenstein's distinctive innovations to consider thoughts only as embodied in what he calls the `significant proposition' and so to transform the question of the relation of thought to reality...into the more promising question of the relation of language to reality.\\"<br />My thoughts on page 11 - would \\"logical space\\" be something very like Plato's world of ideas?<br />In short, this is a book that serves as a useful and constant companion to the Tractatus. It would certainly be best to read the Tractatus first, perhaps in conjunction with a reading of Monks' book on Wittgenstein, but then the companion certainly functions in magnificent ways to expand an understanding of the Tractatus.	2004-04-21

This is the sort of book that talks in a language that subsumes many small arguments in a few big ones. We may critique this technique and say that none of the arguments are demonstrable. There is no \\"QED\\" at the end of this book. This book will have more impact on a public that reads these kinds of books and not on a few that read more technical pieces. So it is clear the importance of it is not in the arguments' success. It is instead important in understanding what sort of narrative can achieve prominence despite the tragic implications believing the narrative may have. While those may think I mean the narrative of the book itself, I suggest the same can be said for the main narrative the book considers the evil in the title - violent fundamentalist Islam.  A great thought: the main challenge to fundamental Islamic thought could possibly come from liberal Islamic thought - perhaps even fostered in the US. The problem with this is that the real issue between fundamentalism and a more liberal perspective is a matter of education. The more education a person has, excluding inculcation of the fundamentalist dogma, the less fundamentalist the person will be. This is precisely the case in other countries, including the US, as well. Perhaps every teacher who has attempted to inculcate more critical thinking skills is aware of how difficult it is to succeed in this and has concluded that most people can not manage it. The idea is as old as Platonic psychology that most people aspire to a life of the satisfaction of lower appetites, fewer aspire to social responsibility, and still fewer aspire to wisdom. What Frum and Perle are suggesting is that there will be fewer evils in the world if more people were wiser. I would certainly agree, but making more people wiser is a universal problem, not simply one in the Islamic community.<br /><br />A blatant parochialism is evident in the suggestions in chapter 5: \\"The War Abroad\\". Concerning Iran (and other Islamic nations get the same sort of treatment) the suggestion is that governments are not legitimate if they are not democratic. For support of this thesis F&P use an ad populum - the American popular opinion. While they offer no support for their feeling that most Americans feel this way, this is a typical misappropriation of the social contract theory to those outside the scope of such social contracts - that may very well be a general feeling among relatively uneducated Americans. Apart from UN attempts to legitimize democracy as universal in scope to even those countries that are non-member states - or even member states that interpret the social contract differently, like China, there is certainly no coherent legitimating narrative supporting the argument that all people have rights as granted by our social contract when they do not belong to our nation state. Children in some foreign countries, like Sudan, can be legitimately sold as slaves, even by their parents, regardless of how abhorrent the practice is to Americans. Using this argument to support the overthrow of the legitimate government of Iran is no different than the Imams arguing that it would be right to overthrow our government because it does not follow Islamic Law. The real argument here, as they most closely follow through the book, is the point that we are at war with Islamic fundamentalism, Iran is a country ruled by Islamic fundamentalists, and so we ought to destroy the Islamic state - or any Islamic fundamentalist state. I would imagine it would also be right, to be coherent, for us to destroy any fundamentalist state regardless of their religion. Since that is not part of the narrative it looks very much like the view that it is us against them despite the suggestion that it is acceptable to use power to liberate them.: \\"The War Abroad\\".

So now I have all this stuff in my driveway - so my house will look like a real Alaskan home - and what am I going to do with it all? So beware!

Not only are they wrong for thinking our image culture is dumber than the text culture of their youth, images have always been a more powerful way to communicate more information to more people. Stafford demonstrates this by showing how art over history has been better at communicating the difficult and complex to a broader audience than text. Text has always been the tool of a limited social class while art has educated the masses. Today with digital art through movies and the Internet web pages even more people can learn more than ever.<br />My own sense tends towards agreement with this thesis. When faced with students that are not interested in reading but love to watch (in the sense of Peter Sellers' \\"Being There\\") I have the clear sense that this is because compared to movies books are boring. Why? Certainly not always, and certainly not for all students, but in general, movies are too compelling a medium to be seriously challenged by a text - (not in the Postmodern sense of \\"the text\\").<br />Stafford's argument lends support to the idea that there is a good reason for this and not just an explanation.<br />My only critique is that there are no color plates and color should certainly be part of the argument.	2004-03-18

French's translation is not so much dry as a close translation of the Russian. In this I keep in mind the indeterminancy of translation (Quine) and that \\"Understanding a sentence means understanding a language.\\" (Wittgenstein) This is a period piece and reading it, even in translation, is entering into the mind of a person living in another cultural world. What feels dry is really a \\"mind-shift\\" -- even in the structure of the English.<br />Notice even the structure of the sentences feels more Russian than English: (p. 7) \\"Already in the fourteenth century there existed\\" follows precisely the word order in the Russian.<br />Beyond this the main issue concerns the purpose of reading Berdyaev. It seems to me that this is a history of philosophy exercise. However, I am aware that many contemporary Russians consider him to be their favorite philosopher. It certainly would take reading him to find out why and doing this should give us some insights into the hopes and dreams of many of our contemporary Russian friends.	2004-03-15

It was a required text for my Sociology course in my student days and I have a fondness for what it did to me in leading me on to PB's &quot;The Social Construction of Reality&quot;. SCR is clearly too difficult for most students and Invitation is much more accessible. Still, I have found students to be aghast at some of the expressions that clearly place it as a book of the sixties. On the other hand, I have not found a more accessible book that describes the postmodern point of view -- the view of sociology -- in as successful a way as this one. I therefore present it along with an explanation. It would be great if Peter Berger readdresses this invitation to new students with an update that incorporates politically correct language. The change in perspective is a tough experience. It would help if the language used were not an additional barrier.<br />I am still looking for a new book that will do the same thing to new students that this book did to me.	2004-02-27

I would like to add my voice to those who list this book as among the most important they have read. As for many, this book marked a turning point in my college education. Berger's \\"Invitation to Sociology\\" was a required text for my Intro to Soc course but that book led me to Construction. I was a philosophy major and reading about Hegel at the time. The coincidence of reading Hegel and Berger turned on a light for me. They both explained one another. Hegel was laying much of the ground work (and there are lots of excellent books that explain why that is) but Hegel is notoriously difficult. Berger's contemporary vocabulary opened my eyes to a successful interpretation of Hegel. Reading Berger was contemporary English instead of translated early 19th century German. At least it was contemporary for me at the time (early 70s). Today there are many phrases students will recognize as politically incorrect -- Berger was writing for a male academic audience. This is a shame since students do find it difficult and the additional discovery of sexist language adds insult to what may very well be viewed as injury. This book will enter a student into reflective thinking stage 6 and so causes all the depressing introspection that will go with that among the bright students. Which brings up a dilemma. Hegel was very positive. Rorty suggests that what he did was replace knowledge with hope. Agreed! While Berger is not clearly negative, there is no positive emphasis. As a result I always feel an obligation to encourage a positive approach to the powerfulness of this world view.<br />My collection of Berger books occupies a highly esteemed shelf in my library.	2004-02-27

Up until this point each philosopher I learned about in class was torn apart by the next philosopher. Hegel approached things differently and made it possible for me to learn what \\"sublated\\" means. Those philosophers were not being \\"torn apart\\" by their successors. Instead, the history of thought can be seen as the logical interplay of ideas gradually creating better ideas. The previous ideas are incorporated in an ever more mature view. This is how we view history. This is why sociology seems to be the philosophy of our day - the sociality of reason.<br /> But this book is deeply embedded in a historical context itself and makes sense only with a good guide. For an interesting way to do this look at Hans Kung's description of his experience of Hegel in his memoirs. For an excellent guide I recommend Pinkard or Kaufmann. My own thesis is on Hegel's Geist.<br /> No philosopher since has ever torn apart another philosopher in my view even if they try to deconstruct them.	2004-02-19

I further thought that as you reached the highest levels you would realize that what the Church teaches was right all along. Beware thinking that the concrete interpretations you have as a young person are the only ways to interpret what was to be believed. I have found the statments of faith, for example Fides et Ratio, to be masterpieces of saying many things at once in many ways.

The new paradigm described seems the point of view of Saint Thomas if you look for it. What do you say to someone who asks if the Bible is true? Yes. If that is the kind of question they ask, then that is the best answer you can give. But as you become a scholar you begin learning what a metaphor is and you realize that all anyone could mean by &quot;literal&quot; is interpretation. So this new paradigm comes with age -- everyone's age. The fundamentalist seeks the concrete descriptions that they can interpret. The more educated adult sees something else, and, God willing, the old see still other things.<br />But this does not mean this is not wonderful Borg. I recommmend this for a beautiful restatement of an ancient way of thinking about Jesus. But I was hoping for something else. A new paradigm there should be. With everything we have learned there should be new interpretations. We have Robert Funk in &quot;Honest To Jesus&quot; but is that the new paradigm? What would Hegel say? It sounds like an old heresy and that is all.<br />We shall need to keep looking.	2004-02-16

Certainly not all of this is funny only if you have read enough philosophy to catch the drift. Is Needleman a metaphor for Heidegger? Or is this whole tid bit on existentialism per se? Will Free Press add a \\"Woody Allen\\" to their series on the World's Living Philosophers? Is Woody living? Is he a philosopher? And if so, is he a living philosopher?<br />Equivocation: I am convinced that all jokes are logical fallacies. The conclusion is the punch line. We should be able to analyze each joke and find which fallacy it takes. A rough review of what I remember in this book strikes me that equivocation is all that Woody uses. Or are there non-sequitors as well? That is what Dave Barry always uses. Booger booger booger. Woody is much more sophisticated. Hence, has a smaller audience.<br />Is it still politically correct to let everyone know we still like Woody or would this suggest bad things about our characters especially if we have adopted daughters? If Woody writes an autobiography and we go to a magician who throws in Woody's book with us -- what would happen? What would happen if the magician throws in this book?

I remember those scenes as incredibly shocking -- I would look over my shoulder even when there was no one there -- in case I might be caught watching such stuff. Today, it seems like only people like me who enjoyed it years ago are interested in it and still enjoy it today. Now, instead of watching things that are a complete waste of time like this, people watch things that are a complete waste of time and not very funny at all. Humor is different. Well, it was different for us too. Imagine your mom and dad laughing at the Monty Python? No. They would have thought it was sick. Now we get to think what our kids laugh at is sick. This book gets to the real life drama behind the nonsense and gives clues to why this sort of thing happens. Humor really is peculiar to a mind set and our minds set in different ways. To some extent, this book could be useful in a study to see why utterances and displays would be funny to one generation and not to another. Is it because it can only be funny once? &quot;Nee&quot; you say?<br />This book also shows us just how British the young boys (and girls) were. For fans of Harry Potter you might note all the class pictures that look just like Hogwarts minus the robes and owls.<br />The pictures are worth the book. But bring some device to carry it out to the car.	2004-02-09

The views of both in a discourse over the tragedy of 9/11 were close enough to the reader to touch. The discussion was in my living room. As one who normally reads Habermas for philosophical wisdom and has grown to avoid reading Derrida whenever possible -- what a difference! -- to avoid a loss of wisdom -- I felt this book was far more interview and less philosophy for some reason. The words were smaller than usual. The sentences shorter. There is the tie in with Europe's past of course.

Here, at the point where Aristotle would challenge us to recognize our soul ends with the body and accept that our soul was past tense -- a narrative sure to depress those who enjoyed life and wish for eternity -- reiterating the Platonic narrative using current idioms is a great service to our dying process. The reassurance that this interpretation of the narrative is persuasive depends on accepting Singh's expereinces which we cannot duplicate. Indeed, those who have had such experience, being present at many deaths, have told me they did not share such experience. But it is a safe argument since we cannot test it. It is beleivable to those who wish to beleive it and that may be enough.	2004-02-04

Still since those of us interested in understanding Pope John Paul II better, even now that the Holy Father has gone on to his next calling, this is a good place to look. I think, and I may be wrong, that the poetry must be better in Polish. Mozhet byt' ya budu chitat' ehto kogda nybud' i uznat esli ehto tak.<br /><br />But it was interesting nonetheless.

LT documents many aspects of this issue and certainly does a good job focusing on bio-techincal issues but there is almost a sense of false cause here instead of wondering why both the technologies and the behaviors have developed. This book presents a stark argument and it feels right but why is it right? I think if we put this in the context of the wider issue of how societies react to environmental stresses we can view the decline of males (and the decline of females! since they are not reproducing either) as an example of our genes interacting with social behaviors to reduce our population. It is working in the developed countries. How do we get it to work everywhere?<br /><br />Update: I have continued to find this one of my most frequently mentioned books in class and other discussions about the subjects associated with it. More information in other studies keep pointing to the usefulness of this view and relationships described by LT. I highly recommend this book!	2004-01-20

In our library this was the only one I found that had \\"slave\\" in the title. I am sure she meant a different book but I was glad to start my acquaintance with Singer with this story.

It starts out in a very surprising way. But of course! Considering this would be written to be published in 1944 a perspective of this sort on values surprises me only to the extent that it has a target at all. I at first thought the real target must be G.E. Moore but he specifically mentions Nietzsche later in the text. (This resulted in a reading of Moore's \\"The Refutation of Idealism\\" leading to a review of some of Berkeley's work...) I found his discussion of the non-dulce character of death (p. 22) interesting in light of what he would later write in \\"A Grief Observed.\\" (Did anyone ever figure out who he meant by Gaius and Titius? (In response to this question I have received two replies both in agreement that \\"they are actually King and Ketley -- the authors of The Control of Language.\\" (Thank you Mark) and \\"the real name of The Green Book is The Control of Language, by Alex King and Martin Ketley (1940). And Orbilius is (again, acc. to my notes) E. G. Biaggini, author of The Reading and Writing of English (1936).\\"(Thank you Kurt))). I also read a BMR review of The Future of Human Nature by Jurgen Habermas,  and noticed that the basic form of most of Habermas' argument followed that of C.S. Lewis in this book. While Habermas (in translation) is concerned with the relationship hypothetical \\"programmers\\" would have with the \\"objects\\" of their efforts, Lewis refers to the \\"conditioners\\" but the reasoning is the same. I suppose this reflects the change from using behaviorism as the tool of control to our more contemporary set of computer metaphors. Notice also that Lewis uses the expression \\"post-humanity\\" p. 75. This is revisited in Fukuyama's book \\"Our Posthuman Future\\".	2004-01-06

It continues to amaze me that biography makes so much clearer than does an author's straight forward critical work. You certainly need both. But a sense of the person who writes makes what they write so much more sensible. This book is more enjoyable than some other autobiographies. Still, it leaves me in a quandary. Much that PF says strikes home but there is always a sense that PF lives within a particular narrative (by the way, he critiques those that talk in terms of narratology on pp. 212-213 \\"The all-but-universal worship of science, social science, and analytic philosophy would soon encourage the half-educated to pepper their discourse with terms like narratology, disciplinarity, engendering, and interface.\\" \\"Half-educated\\"? I have a t-shirt that says, \\"The truly educated never graduate.\\" (Of course this places me in a class.) Today there are books with titles like these and I would hardly refer to the authors as half-educated. It feels almost like C.S. Lewis in \\"Words\\" critiquing their misuse. But new words are invented all the time and come to mean things by their use. I wonder if someplace PF critiques the concept of \\"meme\\". Clearly, PF's classical education is way superior to mine. He would certainly join the defense in the war against grammar. I have a programmable thermostat that I can't figure out how to work.<br />But I am partial myself to the narrative I suspect he follows. I was never in battle though I am retired Army. Should I try a book called \\"Doing Peace\\"? Imagine having a full career in the military without ever being in battle? Assuming I could talk about the experience would annoy PF far worse than Glenn Gray. At least Gray was within miles of such action.<br />As an update years after reading this book and leaving the above as my review I have to point out that I appreciated Paul's participation in the special \\"The War\\" and found his experiences especially profound. It certainly made my appreciation of \\"The War\\" the greater having read his book years before and seeing the images in \\"The War\\" brings home the descriptions from his book.

Why?<br />There has been a flurry of writing over the issue of why Potter has been such a hot item. Why do children like to read the books? We have their quotes to read over and think about. Some declare reading them has pulled them away from the abyss and toward success. Adults ponder these issues and offer various reasons why they think they have been so popular with children. Better, they also ponder why the books have been popular with adults as well. Notice that lady JKR says she wrote the books for herself, because she liked them.<br />Some have detailed the perfect fit the stories have with the trends in political and economic aspects of British or American society. Others have described the wonderful use the plots make of classic templates that always win hearts and imaginations. Harry is Jesus made flesh. Those who see a satanic cultus have been pretty much laughed out of town or they live in towns most laugh at.<br />We also have the interplay with public relations and the media. Lady JKR received good PR even prior to the first publication of HPP/SS. The news media were interested in the poor single mother making good. It was like magic. Scholastic bid high for the rights in America and that meant a burden was on them to produce fans. They did a good job. But of course, the book was good in its own right. The movie stuck to the text, so to speak. One thing AOL did right. The kids would have been disappointed otherwise. Now when we read we picture things according to the film for better or worse. Frankly, I could never have imagined the delivery of lines such as, \\"It does not do Harry to dwell on dreams and forget to live.\\" as well as Richard Harris did. Bless him. The irony of it hurts, but it sounds like good advice and one reason to dwell on someone else's dream when it delivers such wonderful insights.<br />With so many enjoying the books each for their own reasons, it makes little sense to think there is a peculiarly important reason why the books have enjoyed the overwhelming success they have. There are lots of reasons.<br />I do not want the story to stop. It bugs me that I have to wait until next June to see the next movie and even longer to find out what happens to Harry next. But I know I have to be patient. I don't want JKR to feel rushed. I want her to do the job right all the way to the word \\"scar.\\"<br />....<br />Well, no tickling sleeping dragons.<br />[website]f it hurts, but it sounds like good advice and one reason to dwell on someone else's dream when it delivers such wonderful insights.<br />With so many enjoying the books each for their own reasons, it makes little sense to think there is a peculiarly important reason why the books have enjoyed the overwhelming success they have.

Jackson:<br />Jackson argues that Dewey may never really have enjoyed art for arts sake but dealt with art as something to explore how his philosophical principles should be applied to it. Among the interesting themes in this book concern the laboratory school's growth out of Dewey's goal to increase the attraction of education to more students. Most young people wanted to get to making and doing and work and did not have the interest in more abstract learning. The laboratory school was an attempt to get students to \\"make and do\\" but focus on abstract learning doing it. Jackson examines the dilemma this causes in that teachers tend to do less abstract learning and overall learning declines as a result, and that Dewey tried to work with this dilemma but didn't quite get the message out. It sounds a lot like the issues educators face today. If you keep the students interested will they be learning what they need to? Art is one way to make and do in the class room but does it achieve what classical education about art does?	2003-06-18

For the most part he does not do more than state the various possibilities in this but he does lean towards those possibilities that make the US the bad guy. The WTO is also bad. My overall impression is that eating and using resources is bad (SUV drivers beware!) but that poverty means making it possible for everyone in 3rd world countries to live like people in 1st world countries. But wouldn't that be bad? I think Ricard Sole had a more consistent perspective on this.

The same thing is in store in developing countries today. What might help is the recognition by the property owning classes that the overall wealth of their countries would improve drastically if they legitimized those who are de facto using property as the rightful owners: that is surrender their property rights to the squatters and black market business enterprises.

Developing a system of support that depends on the men to be the main providers reinforces the patriarchal system leaving women with the main role of care provider, thus keeping them locked in the very position they tried to escape from. Males also tend to view the marital relationship as one of support for privilege - sexual and housekeeping favors for financial support. With divorce and the end of those privileges they view it unfair that they still have to pay support. Courts and social systems are viewed as being in support of the wife and feminism. Deena concludes that while males should still have to pay support, the support should really come from the state. It is unrealistic to think that a household that was not doing well - as most marriages that end in divorce are doing - would not  be able to support two households when before they could not support one. She realizes this is also unrealistic in a time when budgets are being cut back not raised.<br />She realizes there are conflicts between holding her feminists views and realizing that men do have some grounds for holding their interpretations of unfairness in the system but she blames that on the continuing patriarchal elements in the system used to garner their continuing support.<br />A good quote: \\"Their transformation of patriarch into provider without privilege was unacceptable to them.\\" P. 219	2003-06-14

Specifically, it avoids the Platonic paradoxes by moving away from the orthodox conception of the Creator God who creates ex nihilo or who creates man.

It is translated from the French by Marguerite Wieser and published in 1960.<br />The book is an argument that attempts to establish the authority of the Church as a legal institution that should be a significant influence in determining laws. This quote shows the link: (p. 123) \\"...subordination of State to Law - human law is the sign of God's righteousness and the state is the sign (and not only the sign) of spiritual authorities.\\"<br />As a historical piece that reflects the concerns during the reconstruction of France, this was interesting.

As Barbara points out this is not her primary scholarship interest and the resources she uses seem loaded with the kinds of things I read - so Richard Dawkins for example, so I suspect again this is written more for popular consumption than an advance in the science of war. Again I find it interesting that Barbara has a way of stating her points in a way I find mildly rebuking to the male sex without being as nasty as, say, Andrea Dworkin (by the way, I think Andrea has every right to be that way!) I half wonder reading this if what we see is the other side of the coin. Feminists have pointed out that even our very vocabulary emphasizes male dominance. Now that females are moving toward dominance, we see the vocabulary going the other way. But this book is a remarkably balanced review of contemporary studies of things such as ritual sacrifice, blood rites, ideas concerning the evolution of homo as either forager or hunter. Barbara emphasizes the need for defense against predators (I have to remember to ask Paul, our resident wolf specialist, about page 44 where Barbara references wolves hunting humans in India), as well as the usual comments on why we go to war. I found her presentation much less committed to any conclusion than the summary here Blood Rites: Origins and History of the Passions of War describes. I liked it enough to want to read Barbara's book  Hearts of Men: American Dreams and the Flight from Commitment by Barbara Ehrenreich (Paperback) next. Maybe Wednesday.	2003-02-04

The book is short and can be read in one sitting if you have time to sit. One waitress I mentioned the book too gave me a very patronizing comment that she hadn't heard about the book but would read it when she gets the chance. I suspect this book does not get read by many it purports to study since reading is not one of the things they have time to do. It suggests the individuals working in entry level jobs for minimum (or less) wage and trying to support themselves and perhaps children and others as well are unable to do so, primarily because of the cost of housing. The clear point is that greedy corporations are to blame. If only they raised the minimum wage until it was a living wage - especially by taking into account the cost of housing, or if better more secure cheap housing were made available, this large group of people would lead much better lives.<br />While some people I know point out that they know people that fit the description of the \\"nickel and dimed\\", some even clients, and I am sure there are people in this situation, it has been my experience that the majority of people in entry level jobs are young people still in high school or starting college (or beginning to realize college would be a good idea) and that they are working primarily to earn money they can spend on what they want, not for basic support. For those who are stuck there are lots of reasons and I have no doubt that change in the local economy up and down will make life more or less miserable. I remain convinced that folks like James K. Galbraith have a lot more serious insight even if they are not loaded with comments designed to keep a person from dining out in cheap restaurants or hiring help for around the house.<br />It strikes me that the primary readership of this book are those who enjoy the occasion to know there are many - perhaps most of the working people - who are leading far more miserable lives and that we should be concerned to do something to help them. It reminds me of the special TV coverage of poor people in various parts of the world who need financial help and this TV coverage typically attracts the most donations from those who have the least to give. It is tremendously spiritually uplifting to recognize you are doing well and can help others who are not. Considering the weak impact of such aid especially among those that figure prominently in the video, it is clear to me that non-profit is primarily to the benefit of the bureaucracy that supports it. I am sure that Barbara made some nice change with her book as well.more miserable lives and that we should be concerned to do something to help them.

Neither were the nuns I knew anything like those in the book. What gives? Could there really be people like that with commitment enough to become priests or nuns? I suppose so.
