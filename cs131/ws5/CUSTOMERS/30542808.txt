Once again you're in the normal world until you find that what we consider the normal world is just a thin veneer. While based in the same world as \\"American Gods\\" you will find none of the characters from \\"American Gods\\".  <br /> <br />This book revolves once again around the offspring of a god who was unaware of his origins. The main protagonist in this book is Fat Charlie who discovers not only that his father is a god but he has a brother. <br /> <br />While similar to \\"American Gods\\" this book is much more light hearted. The book definitely has its sinister moments but you will find yourself smiling through much of the book. It's a quick light read that you can get through in a day but like most Gaiman stories it has a surprising depth. It reminded me in many ways of the movie \\"Big Fish\\" with its conflict between a charasmatic father and a serious son. <br /> <br />Fans of who preffered \\"Good Omens\\" over \\"American Gods\\" will probably like this novel better. I enjoyed them both so I liked this book that was in a way a combination of the two.	2005-09-22

I read \\"Assassin's Apprentice\\" back when it first came out and was unimpressed. It was only years later when I went back and was able to read the entire Farseer series in one sweep that I became a diehard Hobb fan. <br /> <br />\\"Shaman's Crossing\\" is a setup book. It revolves around a young man Nevare who as second son to a noble is destined by his culture to become a soldier. The first half of the book deals with his training at his father's estate and the latter half deals with his experiences at a prestigious millitary school for the children of nobles. <br /> <br />The book sets up all the protagonists and antagonists. One struggle will involve a struggle between the old nobles and new nobles(Nevare's father). Another story arc will be between Nevare's people and a race of sorcerous forest dwellers called dapples whose lands Nevare's people are invading. <br /> <br />Overall the excellence of this book will depend on the quality of the finished series. This is rather an excellent building book to a great series or the first book of a series that will drag on to an uninteresting conclusion. <br /> <br />The reason for the four stars and not five is that even in a book that is a building block to a larger story I like a little more contained story, but upon finishing this book I immediately wanted to read the next book of the series.	2005-09-20

In it Jordan has started to build one of the greatest worlds of fantasy that exists in modern fiction. The stories in the Wheel of Time are truly epic.  <br /> <br />The story revolves around a group of youngsters from a village in the middle of nowhere who through a twist of fate find themselves in a battle over the course of their entire world. They live in a world that was broken in a past age(the Age of Legends), a world of kings and queens, a world of witches(Aes Sedai), a world where ervery man who wields magic(channels the one source) goes mad and dies destroying all around them with their power, and a world where a prophecy of a saviour reborn (the Dragon) is both feared and prayed for. <br /> <br />The story is epic, the history of the world is complete and breathtaking in scope and feel, the villains are great(the Forsaken), and the three main heroes interesting. THIS book is terrific. <br /> <br />WARNING. THE ABOVE REVIEW AND RATING ARE FOR THIS BOOK ONLY; NOT THE SERIES. I stand by my statement that every fantasy fan should read this but the reviews rating the entire series are to a greater or lesser extent true. The latter books in the series have seen a decided lack in quality. Different people peak the series at different books; I peak it at \\"Lord of Chaos\\". \\"Crown of Swords\\" and \\"Winter's Heart\\" were OK to me not to some others but \\"Path of Daggers\\" and especially \\"Crossroads of Twilight\\" were pretty horrid. I recomend checking the reviews on \\"Crossroads of Twilight\\". Despite this I will be buying the next book \\"Knife of Dreams\\" in hardback in hopes of a return to better days.	2005-09-10

It is hard to give a review of this book. What can I say that hasn't beens said before? Can I give a review without giving a review of the entire belief system backing up the novel?  <br /> <br />The novel itself is about a world gone wrong. A world that has gone wrong for a very simple reason: All the people of vision and intelligence are disappearing and without these people society is collapsing. This book attempts, and I think succeeds, in laying to rest the lie of communism that says all people are equal and that the highest level a society can attain is a level where people work for the good of the group and their is no individualism. Ayn Rand shows us that there is no such thing as a group, since a group is nothing without its individual members and that within every group there are people that are responsible for keeping the group going and that those people must be given a higher value and that if left to its own devices society has natural ways of rewarding those individuals. <br /> <br />I don't agree with all of Ayn Rand's beliefs. I don't have a problem with religion in general, just unthinking religion. I don't totally agree with her ideas on taxes and wars. I don't even know if I believe in people like John Gault existing outside the pages of her novels. <br /> <br />Despite this I do believe myself an objectivist. Why? Because ultimately objectivism is about freedom. Ayn Rand may not like religion or people who put their lives into a religious organization's hands but in a world dominated by objectivist beliefs those organizations and the people who choose to follow them would be left alone but they could not use force to cause another person to join their religion. Ayn Rand doesn't believe in charity but in a world dominated by objectivist beliefs you would be allowed to give away your entire paycheck if you wanted but you could not force another person to give up a penny of their money if they didn't want to. It's a philosophy of freedom and some people are uncomfortable with the level of freedom given. <br /> <br />I normally don't do this but I would like to adress something I read in a previous review. There is a very powerful scene in this book where the main character Ms. Taggart is trying to free a friend who has been unjustly imprisoned and tortured by a desperate government agent. She tells a guard to open a door at gunpoint. The guard refuses because he claims not to be authorized. The character tells him he is the authority. He refuses and she guns him down without hesitation or remorse. The reviewer actually said she had a problem with a guard being killed for doing his job and that Ms. Taggart stopped regarding the character as human when he refused. When I read this passage I remember thinking how this resembled a possible incident at a German Concentration camp where a guard claimed to just be following orders. The truth Ayn Rand is trying to show us in this incident is that each individual is the ultimate authority and when you give up that authority to the point that you would participate in the imprisonment and sadistic torture of an innocent person for the supposed good of the state you have sold your humanity.	2005-05-31

To me the series peaked at \\"Lord of Chaos\\". Some people peak the series at book four but to me the peak was the battle at Dumai's Well: Asha'man, Aiel, wolves, Aes Sedai. What a scene. Since then there has been a decline with the low point for me being \\"A Path of Daggers\\".<br /><br />I do understand the bad reviews. I review this book using as a standard every other book I have ever read. The reviewers are comparing the later books to the glory that was the beginning of the series. I understand the high standard. You want the later books to be everything they were in the past.<br /><br />This book returns some of the old glory. The main reason for me being something I have been waiting to happen since book one happens. I won't give away what it is but I set the book down totally stoked for book ten (I was sorely disappointed but that's a different review, though I should warn you this book does mark a rise before a massive fall). The writing is as good as ever, the characters seem to break out of some of the annoying grooves they have fallen into (there is a great scene with Perrin chopping a guy's arm off for info). This book puts the end of the series in sight.	2005-05-31

Once when I purchased it when it was just released and recently when I re-read the entire series from beginning to end. It is the only book in the series I don't like. Even books in the series that I had not liked quite as much on the first read when they had just been released worked very well when read as part of the series. <br /> <br />The problem isn't the writing style. It is written as well as the first book. It isn't that nothing interesting happens. There are some very cool scenes in this book. <br /> <br />The problem is plot. Nothing major plot related happens. Nothing. Nada. Zip. Don't get me wrong, he does lots of plot development, just no real development. At the end of book nine Saidan is cleansed. Major plot development. The rebel Aes Sedai open a gate to Tar Valon. Major plot development. This book has the rebel Aes Sedai sitting at the gates of Tar Valon with an army, a Cleansed Saidan, Mat with thye Daughter of the Nine Moons, and Perrin trying to rescue Faile. At the end of the book you have the rebel Aes Sedai sitting at the gates of Tar Valon with an army, a Cleansed Saidan, Mat with the Daughter of the Nine Moons, and Perrin trying to rescue Faile. Nothing really happens. The entire first half of the book takes place in timeline before Rand cleansed Saidan. <br /> <br />But if you are a fan you have to read it. If you own all the others in hardback you have to own this one in hardback. If you are a fan you have to pray to a merciful God that the next book will do something and that we will have it very soon.	2005-04-05

They usually start out full of action and with great characters but by the end of the series the action has mostly disappeared and you have lost interest in the characters and have problems reconciling them with the characters you grew to love at first. This didn't happen here. <br /> <br />Bean has stayed interesting and true to his roots. The action has also kept up a steady pace. I loved the amount and type of action in the other Shadow books and this book consistently delivered what I had grown to like in the first books. There are also many emotional moments as Bean must face his impending doom. Unlike many of the other Card series this emotional crisis doesn't take over the story but is a very enjoyable element. <br /> <br />The multiple story lines are also concluded in a very satisfactory manner. I especially like the fact that Peter Wiggins stops being portrayed as an inept, whiney idiot. That was not the character I had liked in \\"Ender's Game.\\" After many dissapointing series endings lately I'm happy that one of the great series in Sci-Fi, which I always compare to the Harry Potter books in enjoyment and readability, has ended on such an up beat note.	2005-03-30

I would never say that one or the other is better, that is up to the reader, but I would definitely say it is a real treat to be able to switch between the two. The artwork is beatiful and true to story, and I didn't feel that anything was left out that had been in the short story.<br /><br />My only disappointment is knowing they can't do the entire series in this form also.<br /><br />If you already have the first edition of this, the only difference other than the cover is some new artwork in the back of all the individual characters.

One of the reviews on the back boasted \\"if the 'Red Badge of Courage' had been written by H. P. Lovecraft\\". While not quite that good it was nonetheless very impressive.  <br /> <br />The precept is engaging. A post-apocalyptic earth ruled by an alien race that tries for immortality by absorbing energy from humans using vampiric like surrogates. To resist them humans have developed super fighters capable of killing the hunters. While not 100 percent original it is still a new twist using a few of my old favorites; vampires, post-apocalyptic world, and super-enhanced fighters. <br /> <br />The plot is not bad either. We get a good look at the way society functions through Valentines upbringing and enjoy watching his training to become a Wolf, one of the castes of super fighters. The battles are interesting but not over done and at no time does the story seem to drag. <br /> <br />The only thing that keeps this from five stars is that it is a pretty light read content wise. It is a very pleasant 'light' read, but not a book that would approach my favorite list but I did like it.	2005-03-17

I knew for the type of money I was shelling out it would be a good copy, but it even surpassed my high expectations.<br /><br />The thing I enjoy most is the feel. The outside is a soft smooth leather that is a pleasure to hold. The pages are a super fine paper that feels perfectly smooth yet doesn't allow the ink to smear one tiny bit. If you read as much as I do you know the pleasure of holding and leafing through an expensive book as opposed to one that used cheap, rough, highly acidic paper.<br /><br />The other great thing is the look. The gold leaf is very thick and vibrant and doesn't flake off in your hand. On some books the gold leaf can have a washed out look. Not the case here. The gold lettering on the spine and on the cover are also well done.<br /><br />Last but definitely not least is the text. The print is the perfect size, not too small and not too big. The fold out maps are also beautifully done in red and black ink, be extra careful when unfolding them the first time to not rip it.<br /><br />If you love LOTR you owe yourself the joy of having a book of a physical quality that matches the quality of the words J. R. R. Tolkein gave to us. It's worth the price.	2005-01-15

This book is a little better than \\"Naked Empire\\" but it still has many of the same problems, just not as much. <br /> <br />My first problem is the philosophy. Don't get me wrong. I love Ayn Rand, I love the philosophy, and I love the fact the characters in Mr. Goodkind's books live and work using the philosophy of objectivism. My problem are the extended speeches that Richard Rahl gives. In the first four books the characters actions showed their beliefs. The message is weaker when it is told and not shown. I like Ayn Rand's non-fiction works, but it is \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" and \\"The Fountainhead\\" that I especially love because I get to see them live the philosophy. Goodkind did this in the first several books but has gotten progressively worse. <br /> <br />My other problem is the lack of action. He misses a prime chance to show us an awesome battle between Richard and a band of order troops. The first chapter begins by showing us a gravely wounded Richard. He could have started the story ten minutes early and had a more exciting book. I read fantasy because I like fantasy. I like the magic duels and epic battles. While I don't need massive amounts I do like it. I got the feeling in this book that what action there was was thrown in because Goodkind felt it was expected. I didn't get the feeling that Goodkind was into it. <br /> <br />My last problem was that the plot was the same old same old. Uh Oh. Kahlan and Richard have been seperated by some mystic force. The emperor has unleashed some new magic weapon. Somethings up with the books of prophecy. They discover some new magic. <br /> <br />The reason it gets three stars is that despite the philosophy, which wasn't as much as the last, and the same old plot, which is a decent plot just been done, I was entertained. I do wish I hadn't started buying these books in hardback though. I would rather wait and buy these books in paperback but since I've invested this much already I might as well finish.	2005-01-11

Richard Rahl will not appear in this book till the last couple of chapters. I kept waiting for the main characters to take over but they never did. Half way through the book when I finally realized Richard wasn't coming things went better.  <br /> <br />This book doesn't really advance the main storyline at all. It revolves around Richard's evil half brother and sweet and innocent half sister. I personally enjoyed the departure from the main storyline, but I can see how many people would be annoyed by this. The story was interesting enough though that I enjoyed it.	2005-01-11

The story revolves around a handful of central characters and plots; the crippled Prince Barrick and tom boyish Princess Briony, the halfling like character Chert, and the loyal guard captain Vansen. There are also multiple lesser storylines that enrich the main storyline and/or have potential to turn into major storylines. <br /> <br />The book is also not your typical fantasy where a group is on a quest for some mystical treasure that will set the lands to right. Most of the action takes place at Southmarch and deals primarily with the struggle of the Prince and Princess to gain control of their fathers court. This is a nice departure from the fantasy norm. <br /> <br />The only thing people might have problems with is the slow start that is typical to Williams novels. If you are familiar with William other two series you know he took the entire first book just to get the reader inside the Otherland system and it was almost half of \\"The Dragonbone Chair\\" before Simon left the castle. If you like a fast paced story that breaks right out of the gate you'll probably be disappointed at first, but in typical Williams fashion the last third of the Book blasts by leaving you desperate for the next book. <br /> <br />If you're simialar to me and liked the Otherland books but thought the Memory, Sorrow and Thorn books were superior, you'll be happy to see Williams solidly back in the realm of fantasy.	2004-11-12

Not everything turned out how I expected it to, but that's OK.  <br /> <br />The characters were developed more with some characters you hated in the first two books fleshing out into likeable human beings. The Kennit thread of the story gets nicely resolved and I had truly not expected myself to like what happened with that story thread at all. The serpents finally make full sense to me which had been a source of slight discontent in the first book. The political and social problems in Bingtowm were also nicely handled. <br /> <br />Overall a truly satisfying end that had a few surprises, a good amount of justice, and didn't seem like a slapped on ending like many trilogy endings have a habit of feeling.	2004-10-29

I read this book on the recomendation of a friend. At first I was a little worried. The book starts out a tad slow. I was a little confused by the chapters pertaining to the serpents and the opening with the mysterious island didn't have me frothing at the bit. <br /> <br />But then you get in the book and you just can't put it down. There are so many good storylines that run through the book. You quickly become engrossed in the actions and well being of the characters who are well rounded with their share of quirks and demons. <br /> <br />The story line has you turning pages at an ungodly rate and when you reach the end you'll probably do what I did and run out and buy book two and three. <br /> <br />But if like me you find yourself having problems getting into the book at first stick with it. It seems to be a trademark of the Robin Hobb books to start slow then explode into action.	2004-10-29

I am always worried that this will be the book where the author blows it, and I always pretty much know that the latest book won't be as good as its predecessors. Thus does not seem to be a problem with Martin. <br /> <br />This is seriously my favorite book of the series to date and incidently my favorite fantasy book. In a series that is to date full of surprises and very complex characters, this book has once again upped the stakes. <br /> <br />Once again, many of your preconceived notions of a characters motivations and actions shall be turned on its collective ear. The characters become richer and more real than ever. And if you had mixed feelings about the Lannisters in the previous two books, all I can say is that you ain't seen nothing yet. <br /> <br />Also if you think Martin has trimmed all the characters he could from the previous two books, it is now a distinct possibility the series will end with everybody dead, which at the current rate will be about two and a third more books, so if you hated the deceptive ease in which Martin slaughtered characters in the first book prepare for pain. <br /> <br />And once again to all you fans bothered by the sex, blood, and general unpleasant behaviour of the world of A Song of Fire and Ice, if you hated it in the first two books you'll hate it here also. If you want a pretty fairy tale read go by Harry Potter. It's well written and so far Harry hasn't been eviscerated.  <br /> <br />But if you're like me and have marvelled at what Martin has done to date, you'll definitely want to add this to your collection.	2004-10-28

I figured I was getting one of two things; a book showing that the Witch wasn't really evil or a book showing she was evil but from her point of view trying to justify her evil actions. Either way I was looking forward to a book that would play in the wonderful world of Oz, a land every person in America and many in the world got to visit as a child, and woould probably be humorous. <br /> <br />Then when I first started reading I was a little surprised about how the story was going. The world wasn't seeming very magical and definitely wasn't funny at all. The book seemed to concentrate on what an outcast the poor green kid was, and while it wasn't what I expected, with almost zero humor, I kept at it seeing it had potential to be great even though it wasn't what I had picked up the book looking for. <br /> <br />It wasn't great, or even good, or even tolerable. My problems were many. <br /> <br />One. It was way too normal. Why pick the land of Oz and the Witch to write about if you are going to try to make the world as normal as you can. I understand picking a character that every one perceived as evil and then showing us how we make false assumptions, but you could have done that and still been true to the land of Oz. <br /> <br />Two. It was way too philosophical. I like philosophy but only when it's good. There were no great revelations shown. I didn't get an epiphany that I should stop mistreating people that are different. It is nothing new in a book to see people treating people who are different cruelly. The author's only hope of introducing this in a new and original way was lost when magic was mostly removed from her writing world. <br /> <br />Three. The book was boring. Not just the theme was bad, I also thought the writing was atrocious. The flow stunk, the dialogue was uneedfully long, and the action slow to happen and when it did it was over before it started. <br /> <br />Four. I didn't like any of the characters.Even the protagonist, the Witch, was not very likeable. While I understand the author's need to seperate her from the other characters, I didn't understand her need to seperate her from me the reader. <br /> <br />This was one of my biggest dissapointments of the year. It was especially bad when I think of what another author could have done with this truly awesome idea.	2004-10-23

I never felt truly close to any of the main characters. I didn't feel like they were as believable and developed as they could have been. Over and over you were told how smart Dirk was, but other than a couple of parlor tricks he was never shown to be a genius. The main bad guys were also very shallow. I had a hard time believing the Lion of Senet or the High Priestess were capable of running the world based on the people Fallon showed us. <br /> <br />Also, I was very disappointed with the slow start this novel had. I don't have to be drawn in on the first page, but I was halfway through the book before I got the least bit interested. The writing style is OK but nothing exceptional. <br /> <br />The reason I am giving it three stars, instead of one or two, is that the book did finally pick up and begin to interest me slightly, but it still was nothing exceptional. It's an OK book, and I will probably read the entire series because I've started it, but if you're looking for a great read there are countless more worthy novels.	2004-10-23

I have enjoyed all of Goodkind's books up till now. Some have been better than others, but all were enjoyable.  <br /> <br />The main problem with this book was the philosophy. The philosophy he is putting forth is objectivism. I like objectivist philosophy, but from the original writer, Ayn Rand. While it is OK to have a certain philosophy for your characters to work within, Goodkind slaps it on way to thick.  <br /> <br />The writing style itself is good as you would expect from Goodkind and the actual story line that has a villain and a fight between good and evil is solid. The problem is is that nothing happens. The action is slow and boring; Richard is once again sick, a recurring problem that has to me been used too much; and the book spends way too much time talking about philosophy.	2004-10-21

Books one through four where pretty much an uninterrupted stream of events and the sudden leap in time left me a bit disconcerted at first, especially being the last book, but once I adjusted I truly enjoyed what Kearney did. <br /> <br />In a lot of ways this seemed like a book long epilogue. He promptly ties off loose ends and by the end of the book no story line is left unfinished, I didn't say all questions were answered though. It is not neccesarily a happy conclusion but for me it was a satisfying and interesting one with some unexpected surprises. <br /> <br />Some reviews state that he seems to have gotten tired of writing and just quit, but I will say that after impatiently waiting for the next books from authors like Robert Jordan, George R.R. Martin, Terry Goodkind, and R.A. Salvatore it is a nice change of pace to have a well written series end in a timely manner.	2004-10-19

I wasn't too impressed with the Krondor books, but this series is right on the money. <br /> <br />Feist once again starts moving forward in time again instead of going back and rehashing old ground. The writing is solid, the new, old villains(Midkemia readers will know what I mean) are great, and the further expansion to the knowledge of the different lands and peoples of Midkemia is grteat. <br /> <br />If you haven't read any of Feist's previous work I wouldn't neccesarily recomend this book as a starting point. You would probably still enjoy the book, but many of the supporting characters and situations and past events the characters talk about would be unknown to a new reader and since Feist doesn't spend time rehashing old ground you would probably want to go buy \\"Magician: Apprentice\\" instead.	2004-10-19

I didn't expect anything exceptional, but my low expectations were undeserved. The book is well written and imaginative.  <br /> <br />You get a nice world were Mr. Kearney pulls facets from our own history. On one hand there is a storyline resembling the clashes between Islamic and Christian nations in the middle ages, on the other a feudal society clashing with a new native continent, and on another strife within a corrupt religious hierarchy. <br /> <br />The characters are engaging, the politics solid without being overly complex, and the magic, while fairly standard, slightly creative and unintrusive.	2004-10-19

I was so impressed with the story \\"Hedge Knight\\" I ran out and bought this book and was astounded.<br /><br />He has very interesting, very rounded characters. You never can take it for granted that a character is good or evil like you do in other books. His characters are true to life in that they are rarely good or evil but only acting life based on their own observations.<br /><br />His use of politics and house alliances are to me reminescent of Frank Herbert's Dune series. The world itself while a world of magic doesn't hit you over the head repeatedly with magical happenings. The magic is nicely understated, opposite of most Dragonlance or Forgotten Realms books where items and beings of immense and almost unstoppable magic are a dime a dozen. The magic thickens the plot but doesn't move it.<br /><br />The only 'but' I will add is that this is not a happy go lucky book where the good guy is always saved at the last minute and evil always cast down. Be warned, he will strike characters down with ease anytime he chooses. Some people don't like having characters,good or evil, they are interested killed. I like it because he does it well. Character deaths always advance the storyline. I think it brakes the mold and is good, other people hate it, mostly I think because Martin has the skill to make his throw away characters interesting and important, he doesn't skimp on a character just because he plans to kill it nor is he afraid to use the soon to be departed in major important story roles.<br /><br />The world of \\"A song of Fire & Ice\\" is full of sex, death, and violence in all its gory detail. If you don't like that I suggest reading Harry Potter: I'm being serious.	2004-10-18

If you aren't and are just making sure the series doesn't tank after the first book don't worry. <br /> <br />Every bit as good as the original (A Song of Fire and Ice novel). It shows the same excellent writing seen in the first novel. New characters are introduced and old fall by the wayside, sometimes in rivers of blood but with Martin these things happen so learn to live with it. There is not much more to say because; if you've read and loved the first book you're getting more of the same that you loved in a series that has the potential of rising to the top next to Tolkein and if you read the first book and hated it and are waiting for a kinder, gentler on his characters Martin: go buy Harry Potter instead. No insult intended to Harry Potter, I like those books.	2004-10-18

Alot of readers are giving this a good review of five stars even though they think it wasn't a great part of the series. I'm not angry that much of the book was supposed to be sad, I didn't need a happy ending just a good one. <br /> <br />One of the worst conclusions to a series I've ever read. I didn't think the characters of the ka-tet acted in character. The final battles ended with dissapointing ease. It took two books to build up to Mordred who was a total weakling and didn't in the end even effect the main plot. The Crimson King who was built as the most powerful force of evil in the entire Stephen King multi-verse, a multi-verse including demons and Satan and powerful vampires, only had Harry Potter class SNEETCHES in his arsenal in the final battle. There is also a seemingly very powerful important character introduced about 200 hundred pages from the end, that's just sloppy writing. I also hated the parts were King wrote himself in. Not because he did it but because he did it WAY too much. <br /> <br />PLEASE. If you love Roland of the line of Eld and the members of the ka-tet don't read this book. Remember the strong, noble, and interesting characters from the previous novels and pretend they quit and went off to Disney World. It would leave a much better mental picture than the one I have too deal with after reading this book.	2004-10-17

In and of itself the book was awful because as a book it did nothing to help resolve anything in the plot. I think a book, even if part of a series needs to have a feel that something gets accomplished, I'm not saying that a book can't have a cliffhanger ending like the Wastelands had, I'm saying that even with the ending Wastelands advanced the plot in a significant way and was a good story. \\"Song of Susannah\\" is not a good story. The plot lines added flat out stink. When Kinh mentions himself in Wolves it was kind of cute but never should have been worked into a major story element and Susannah's pregnancy is horribly drawn out. <br /> <br />BUT. When I read it I gave it the benefit of a doubt because it is well written and the last book was shortly coming out to resolve all the great story lines from the previous five books and to hopefully clean up the crap added in this book. If the final book had been the least bit good I would have said this book was a three maybe even four star book. Not because it was good but because it was crap that helped build the anticipation to an awesome ending. The ending was crap. Do yourself a favor and stop with Wolves. <br /> <br />BUT. If you have to know, like I would, you've waited this long, wait a few more months for the paperbacks.	2004-10-17

This book was way to brief. We spent hundreds of pages building up to a final battle that was boring, over way to quickly, and didn't make alot of sense compared to the chain of events seen in the previous novels. <br /> <br />The Will dilemna is solved in a very unsatisfactory way as were pretty much all the resolutions. It seemed as if Stackpole thought hey time to end it and just threw something together thtat tied up all loose ends. I didn't feel like the ending was given much thought.	2004-10-15

If you had already read the shorter version of this in \\"Legends,\\" edited by Silverberg, you should be on the same page. <br /> <br />In \\"Legends\\" this was a good, tight, short story. The added chapters just slowed it down though some might enjoy a slightly more in depth look into the workings of the White Tower. <br /> <br />Also as an impatient fan looking forward to the end of the series, I can't help feeling the work on expanding this short story into a novel was time wasted from finishing the main story line.	2004-10-15

Gaiman's short story for the \\"American God's\\" world is a must for fans. Card does a decent job and you'll want to read this story before reading \\"Chrystal City.\\" Haydon's story is also good even if you've never read any of her other work. <br /> <br />The only total bomb in this was McCaffrey's short story explaining what happens to dragons that become lost between. Even fans of the Pern novels should skip this one.	2004-10-12

In most series endings you get the idea the author ran out of ideas so quickly ties of the story line with the first thing that comes to mind. This ending isn't quick and simple, but it also isn't overll complex. Good wins, evil is punished, etc..	2004-10-10
