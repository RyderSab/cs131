Thus, Stone Sweet shows how theories of international relations and intergovernmentalism become less and less relevant to the European Union, as the reach of EU law grows.  Because any explanation for the power of the European Court of Justice relies on institution building and institutional effects, the most powerful current theories of EU politics are \\"institutionalist\\" in nature, bridging the divide between domestic and international politics.<br />For Stone Sweet, these institutions (principles, norms, rules and procedures, which make up the &quot;judicialization&quot; of policy-making) can themselves be taken as explanatory variables that \\"organize ongoing normative deliberations that seek to define and redefine the nature of the community\\" (10).  In other words, institutions have the power to \\"constitute\\" individuals and construct their preferences to some degree.  That is, institutions shape not only strategies, but also  goals and norms of behavior, arising, in Stone Sweet's case, from constitutionally binding case law.<br />Much of the earlier work on EU integration, including neofunctionalism, had claimed that actors could be socialized into EU processes and identities, but did not offer much in the way of testable causal mechanisms.  Stone Sweet can thus be commended for giving us a concrete causal model explaining how \\"judicialization is the process by which legislators absorb the behaviour norms of constitutional adjudication, and the grammar and vocabulary of constitutional law, into those repertoires of reasoning and action that constitute political agency\\" (204).  Thus, when studying the (initially economic) impetus for European unification, Stone Sweet shows how studying the (rational) economic and political interests of member state governments alone is a poor starting point for understanding nature and effects of the emerging European polity.<br />These same economic interests are at the root of Stone Sweet's second key contribution to the EU literature; namely, his support for a renewed use of neofunctionalism, a neo-neofunctionalism, if you will.  Originally, neofunctionalism took taken heavy criticism, because it allegedly postulated an automatic rationality and inevitability to the integration process, without offering falsifiable propositions about when integration might slow down or even reverse, due to political change.<br />These are heavy allegations, but Stone Sweet's use of neofunctionalism counters these charges quite well, by specifying and demonstrating a normatively-based \\"rationality\\" to the process (a community of norms that frames rational action), offering a theory of how this process works (constitutional conflict, leading to delegation to the constitutional court, leading to constitutional decision-making/rule-making, leading to &quot;judicialization&quot;), and carefully assessing the feedback effects of institutional integration on domestic structures:  \\"in today's multi-tiered European polity, the sovereignty of the legislature, and the primacy of national executives, are dead\\" (193).  As the new standard-bearer of EU functionalism, Stone Sweet makes a persuasive case that IR theory cannot explain the \\"top-down\\" nature of EU constitutional politics; that is, how initially rational economic preferences turned into a seemingly inexorable process of legal dialogue, \\"socializing more and more actors-private litigants, judges and politicians-into the system, encouraging more use\\" (165).  Through the vehicle of \\"rights,\\" the ECJ used the logic of economic integration to enhance its role as dispute resolver.  Initially, member state governments had no interest in supranational rights protections:  \\"their purpose was not so much to create rights claims for individuals, as to remove potential sources of distortion within the common market\\" (171). But to fulfill this \\"function,\\" rights claims had to be put into action, leading to the process of judicial governance.  Looking at member state preferences alone cannot explain this phenomenon, and thus Stone Sweet's supranational functionalism proves superior to the intergovernmentalism of a scholar like Moravcsik.remove potential sources of distortion within the common market\\" (171).

Perhaps the most important work that arose out of Gourevitch's call to coalition analysis was Rogowski's &quot;Commerce and Coalitions&quot; (1989), which parsimoniously and elegantly engaged both the second-image reversed literature and the literature on domestic coalitions.<br />Rogowski responds to work that had previously looked at domestic coalition (cleavage) formation, without considering international trade, such as Lipset and Rokkan (1967) and Moore (1967).  In line with the second-image reversed argument, Rogowski instead uses the Stolper-Samuelson theorem to explain domestic cleavages.  Briefly, the S-S theorem says that trade will benefit the abundant factor(s) (land, labor and/or capital) in each country, and harm the scarce factor(s).  Rogowski draws a political implication from this theorem, which is that the benefited group will gain more political power by way of economic leverage and strategic incentives.  More specifically, Rogowski's model can predict either an urban-rural conflict or a class conflict.  In the first case, land is the abundant factor which would benefit.  Capital and labor, normally based in an urban environment, are scarce and would go on the defensive.  In the latter case, the economy is endowed in labor, and capital and land are scarce, thus leading to an assertive coalition of landowners and capitalists.<br />But there are two key problems with this type of second-image reversed coalition analysis.  The first is that outcomes are under-specified and ambiguous, and the second is that process-tracing is nearly absent.<br />For Rogowski, outcomes are in fact blatantly under-specified, because Rogowski does not actually predict outcomes!  He admits as much when he writes that \\"winners can expand their political influence\\" (4 - note the hedging by the use of the term &quot;can&quot; instead of &quot;will&quot;), and \\"as the desire and the means for a particular political preference increase, the likelihood grows that political entrepreneurs will devise mechanisms that can surmount the obstacles to collective action\\" (5).  Not only are we faced with this ambiguous, probabilistic argument, but we are also told that those harmed by free trade will demand \\"protection or imperialism\\" (5), but we are not told which one, and under what circumstances.  Further, Rogowski admits that \\"winners\\" who are strengthened politically might still lose, without telling us cases or conditions under which they would do so.  \\"Victory or defeat depends, so far as I can see, both on the relative size of the various groups and on those institutional and cultural factors that this perspective so resolutely ignores\\" (20).<br />Process-tracing is also absent from Rogowski's analysis, because there is little empirical evidence of his hypothesized effects at work.  In effect, a coalition's capture of the state is a \\"black box\\", in that we don't know how exactly how it happens.  First of all, some countries might depend only marginally on trade, which he admits.  Second, when Rogowski does get into empirical cases, he begins to introduce elements that are not found in the original hypothesis, such as degree of skill of labor, and how \\"advanced\\" certain economic sectors are.  And finally, he ignores the role of information and strategy, in that holders of factors need to be able to know their opportunity costs and incentives, calculate the best course of action, and resolve collective action problems in taking this action.  The book says almost nothing about these problems.<br />However, Rogowski's theory, while it under-predicts and fails to process-trace, can probably be forgiven because of its incredible degree of parsimony and explanatory leverage.  With a simple model of international trade, he is able to shed causal light on a multitude of historical cases of domestic political change.rade, he is able to shed causal light on a multitude of historical cases of domestic political change.	2003-12-09

The \\"strategic choice\\" approach of Lake and Powell, unlike that of Waltz, is strongly predicated on methodological individualism and the importance of unit-level rationality, meaning that the preferences and strategies of individual actors are more important for Lake and Powell than for Waltz.  Stein's chapter (in this book) calls for beginning with \\"purposive, intentionalist, rational explanations of behavior\\" (198) and then adding the component of actor interaction, in a bottom-up way.  While Lake and Powell do try to cast themselves as agreeing with Waltz that \\"actors' intentions are not always a sufficient explanation for outcomes\\" (17), their game-theoretic, unit-level starting point necessarily privileges actors' intentions more than does Waltz's approach.  On the topic of alliances, they take issue with Waltz's claim that balance-of-power politics necessarily prevails in all anarchic, self-help systems. Using game theory, Lake and Powell show that in repeated interactions, for any given division of benefits, \\"there exist strategies such that no actor has any incentive to deviate from its strategy\\" (24).  These strategies do not entail balancing, because \\"it is in each actor's self-interest to participate in punishing a deviator\\" (24), as opposed to creating a new balance.  From this formal insight from game theory, Lake and Powell conclude that Waltz has a problem of \\"inadequately specified microfoundations\\" (24).  Because game theory tells us that Waltz's \\"causal chain from anarchy and the desire to survive to balancing behavior is incomplete\\" (24), Lake and Powell call for further analysis of the preferences and strategies of individual states - exactly the kind of approach that Waltz scorns as confusing process with system.<br />Although it might confuse process with system, and/or go against the goal of parsimony, the strength of the strategic choice approach is that it can actually illuminate and process-trace why states assess their survival prospects and decide on one behavior or another.  In other words, it can elaborate the relationship between system and outcomes in a more direct way than Waltz's theory.  When Waltz writes that the system determines alliances, so that states' behavior (if they want to survive) is determined by the system, he seems to imply that states have the necessary information to know which choice is best, and that they will know which other choices will lead to defeat, and thus will not choose those paths and those alliances.  But this is all implied.  Waltz has no theory of individual strategizing because he claims that one is not necessary - the system does a better job of explaining outcomes.  To put this claim to the test, the authors in the Lake and Powell volume attempt to unpack the unit-level strategizing that accompanies anarchy and alliances.<br />The chapter by Morrow is a prime example of this unpacking.  In looking at unit-level strategizing in the international system, Morrow sees three fundamental strategic problems that Waltz would dismiss as process: signaling, commitment and bargaining.  Based on the fact that other states' intentions are unknown, states have imperfect information, and must rely on \\"signals\\" from other states about intentions.  Further, even if intentions to ally or cooperate are correctly judged through signals, states still do not know if the commitment to ally or cooperate is credible.  And finally, even if signals are correct and commitments are credible, states are unsure about negotiation - about what potential deals the other state will find acceptable.<br />Modestly arguing that this approach has led to a fundamental rethinking of international relations, Morrow applies game-theoretic analysis of his three strategic problems to the issue of alliances and balancing.  Morrow's cut at the issue, where he departs from Waltz, is the question of \\"what factors might lead states to fail to balance when they should?\\" (103).  Presumably Morrow means by \\"should\\" that according to a Waltzian logic of self-help, states facing a threat will have strong incentives to balance against that threat.  But for Waltz, remember, there is no room for failure to balance.  States either balance or die, and seeing this, they will always balance.  Thus, Morrow immediately departs from the structural logic of Waltzian balancing.  Again using a form of game theory (public goods and collective action), Morrow highlights the rationality of defection, or \\"buck passing\\", in failing to form alliances.  Since war entails high costs, states hope that others will bear the cost of defeating a threatening power, thus reaping the benefits while paying lower costs.<br />Morrow also highlights a second problem that can be read as a critique of a traditional Waltzian approach.  Morrow writes that conventional alliance theory does not explain why states need formal agreements in advance to come to each other's aid.  Morrow, on the other hand, has an explanation: that alliances, though costly, are useful signals or commitment devices, for the benefit of deterring threatening powers.  Unlike Waltz, domestic politics plays a key constraining role in alliance formation for Morrow, since domestic politics is responsible for the costliness of alliances, meaning that the perceived deterrence gains must be high, and meaning that coordination must be strong, necessitating formal, written agreements.  Waltzian theory has nothing to say about the costliness of alliances; presumably, for Waltz, alliances are costless - thus, there are no obstacles to forming them, if the system demands it.  Morrow tells us otherwise.<br />The strategic choice approach thus problematizes alliance formation and balancing, and shows us how it might not happen even when the \\"system\\" demands it.  This insight can only be accomplished by devolving the analysis to the unit level, and analyzing preferences and strategies.  Not only does this devolution shed doubt on the core assumptions of Waltz, like the \\"objective\\", universal national interest in survival (Stein, 205), but it also calls into question the entire emphasis on structure: \\"social structure is, in part, a product of human agency\\" (Stein, 222).  Where alliances are concerned, we see that an emphasis on agency can illuminate the causal chain between anarchy and alliances, explaining why alliances might fail to form even when the systemic logic supposedly demands them.ce when they should?\\" (103).

To illuminate the puzzle of why states form alliances with other states, if they (according to his theory) are necessarily &quot;selfish&quot;, Waltz first makes the necessary distinction between domestic and international politics.  This distinction is necessary so that Waltz can show us how alliance formation follows a fundamentally different logic in an anarchic system than it does in a system with some form of central authority (hierarchy) like the state, because the state monopolizes legitimate violence, so that a domestic system is not self-help - one can appeal to the state for defense.  While it is debatable that all or even the majority of states have enjoyed a true monopoly on legitimate violence throughout history, we must grant Waltz this axiom if the remainder of his arguments are to hold.<br />Waltz then takes the domestic/international comparison into the realm of economics and interdependence, arguing that within the state, actors are \\"free to specialize because they have no reason to fear the increased interdependence that goes with specialization\\" (104).  Because the state guarantees security, all can be most concerned with their own (absolute) gains.  However, in a self-help system, worries about survival in anarchy make units more concerned with relative gains.  States do not want to be dependent on other states, which hinders the benefits of specialization.  Interdependence, instead of enriching all, becomes a threat to survival, because it creates vulnerability.  This is a result of the structure of the anarchic system, despite the best intentions of those who want cooperation.  \\"Structures cause actions to have consequences they were not intended to have\\" (107).  Thus, the only thing that can change these effects is structural change.<br />Against those who would argue that the international system is not a pure anarchy because we see alliances, Waltz would argue that they confuse structure with process.  He does admit that states sometimes cooperate, obviously, but \\"only in ways strongly conditioned by the anarchy of the larger system\\" (116).  The primary way of doing this, captured by balance-of-power theory, is \\"moves to strengthen and enlarge one's own alliance or to weaken and shrink an opposing one\\" (118).  Interestingly, Waltz claims that his theory does not require rationality on the part of the actors - they simply emulate more successful rivals, or else they perish.  Thus, \\"balances of power tend to form whether some or all states consciously aim to establish and maintain a balance\\" (119).<br />Why should we expect to see alliances balancing one another, as opposed to bandwagoning onto a winning alliance?  Again, the structural logic does the explanatory work.  Because the international system is self-help, \\"balancing is sensible behavior where the victory of one coalition over another leaves weaker members of the winning coalition at the mercy of the stronger ones\\" (126).  In other words, nobody wants anybody except themselves to \\"win\\", and so states gang up against a likely winner, meaning that the structure induces security (not power per se) as the primary concern.  Waltz even characterizes this induction as a kind of sociological process, positing that the \\"socialization\\" of nonconformist states (he gives the Soviets as an example) is inevitable, given that isolationism is not an option: \\"one party may need the assistance of others.  Refusal to play the political game may risk one's own destruction\\" (128).<br />For Waltz, then, the only important changes are structural ones.  Since anarchy will not disappear, the only structural changes that can happen is changes in the distribution of state capabilities.  Given that Waltz has solved the puzzle of alliances and balancing by showing how they are structurally necessary if states hope to survive, he then goes on to link changes in the distribution of state power with the question of the likely configuration(s) of alliances that will arise from these changes.  In order to do so, he first establishes how to measure power and \\"polarity\\" (number of alliances/powers in the system).  After rather sarcastically rebutting critics who think the world is not bipolar, and arguing that his theory boils down to \\"common sense\\", Waltz predictably defines power as the total and combined distribution of material capabilities across states, meaning that only the U.S. and the Soviet Union qualify.  For Waltz, this bipolarity is a normatively good thing, because his argument touts its peace-enhancing characteristics.  Since interdependence is dangerous, and since interdependence decreases as the number of powers decreases, security is enhanced, and uncertainty is reduced.  Waltz even goes so far as to claim: \\"now governments are more involved in their national economies than they are internationally.  This is fortunate\\" (159).<br />The key point to highlight here, for Waltz's theory of alliances, is that alliances are formed and balanced in response to structural conditions.  Preferences, costs and benefits to individual states do not matter, because the structural properties of unitary states, anarchy, and the distribution of power determine the configuration that assures outcomes.  If the distribution of power happens to be in a certain configuration, meaning that states only make gains or losses relative to that overall distribution, then the likely resulting alliance pattern is pre-ordained.  Any \\"deviant\\" path taken by any state will result in certain defeat for that state, and thus states will avoid taking this path in the first place.<br />Of course, rationalist or strategic choice theorists would say that Waltz neglects the role of calculation and doesn't provide microfoundations, while constructivists would proclaim that Waltz ignores the role of identity.  However, by ignoring these (probably important) factors, Waltz reaps a large payoff in terms of parsimony and explanatory leverage.m these changes.

Instead of arising out of an Islamic religious specificity, for Roy, Islamist movements are direct products of the political sociology of the modern, nation-state era.<br />Other scholars, like Burgat, also make this argument, but Roy departs from Burgat's conclusions in one major area, which is his evaluation of the logic of the Islamists' mission, and its likely political fate.  This evaluation forms the major argument of his book; the so-called \\"failure\\" of Islamism because of its necessary reliance on the very modernity that it seeks to counter.  For Roy, Islamism will fail because it contains internal contradictions that will be the seeds of its own downfall.  These contradictions are in the relationship of Islam to politics.  Roy claims that Islamism rejects political philosophy, since it sees no separation between religion and politics (unlike traditional Islamic culture, he is careful to point out, differentiating himself from the Orientalists), it sees no role for institutions, and sees \\"virtue\\" as the only necessary leadership quality.  Thus, Islamism, by self-definition, writes itself out of the very political arena it seeks to enter.  \\"The magical appeal to virtue masks the impossibility of defining the Islamist political program in terms of the social reality\\" (71).  In other words, there can be no Islamic state without virtuous Muslims, but there can be no virtuous Muslims without an Islamic state.  Islamist ideas, because they do not match social reality, end up in self-negation, since the arise from and rely upon this social reality.<br />Empirically, Roy sees this social reality as mainly an urban one, which bears little or no resemblance to traditional Muslim village culture.  Not only do Islamists come from urban, educated and non-traditional backgrounds, but they also seek to \\"construct a new urban space, in which relationships would no longer be mediated solely by family or guild bonds\\" (59).  Thus, those who see Islamists as wanting to return to a medieval or traditional society are misreading the movement's program, which differs from traditional Muslim culture in many areas, such as the acceptance of social differentiation in society, including conceptions of political parties, and new roles for groups such as women and ulamas.  However, Roy sees this acceptance of social differentiation as an internal contradiction in the logic of Islamism, since the ideal of Islamist movements is a wholly egalitarian society, without classes or political parties.<br />Politically, Islamists depart from their own traditions in replacing the concept of the caliph (a religious ruler, of the tribe of the Prophet) with that of the amir, who can of course spring from a new (modern) social elite.  This provides evidence against a traditionalist, orientalist reading of the Islamist program, since the amir is elevated to a position above even the ulamas, who are religiously sanctioned interpreters of the holy text.  Thus, if the Islamic religion were the causal factor, then we might see the ulama or a neo-caliph touted as leader, instead of an amir that can be adapted to modernity.  In fact, Roy claims that Islamists compromise with modernity by departing from the positions of the ulama on three issues:  political revolution (they favor it), the role of sharia (they favor it less than the ulama does, and want to go beyond its limited reach), and the role of women (they are more emancipatory).<br />More generally, Roy argues that there has historically been a de facto autonomous public space in the Muslim world, a separation between religion and politics, with the ulama and the sharia on one side, and the ruler on the other.  This goes against cultural arguments that see \\"despotism\\" as inherent to Islam throughout history.  But the paradox, for modern Islamists, is that in seeking a Muslim state, they break this tradition.  By concerning themselves with politics, they reject the autonomous space of politics that the ulama accepted, \\"specifically, the possibility for the state to elaborate a positive law to legislate in areas not covered by the sharia\\" (64).  Thus, they revive politics even as they seek to negate it.  For Roy, \\"no matter what the actors say, any political action amounts to the automatic creation of a secular space or a return to traditional segmentation\\" (23).  In order to destroy secular space, the Islamists are required to create it.<br />There are many different ways to phrase these contradictions and paradoxes, which show that Roy has identified some inherent tensions in the logic of political Islam.  However, the most pressing critique that can be made of his book is that logical inconsistencies in the ideas of a political movement do not automatically translate into a death sentence for that movement's practice, as Roy seems to want us to believe.  One only need think of the contradictions inherent in democracy, i.e. between liberty and equality, or between majoritarianism and minority rights.  Would democracy be called a failure because it contains these contradictions?  No.  Political movements are pragmatic and synthetic, and they often endure despite problematic ideational underpinnings.  Followers make compromises and adapt to social realities, while attempting to stay in touch with ideational inspirations as well.  Roy seems to hold Islamists to unrealistically high standards, chastising them for failing to rapidly create new societies and states, and even to redraw world borders.  If the bar were set lower, Roy might acknowledge that Islamists have achieved substantial political change despite their supposedly contradictory relationship with modernity and the realm of politics.sts, is that in seeking a Muslim state, they break this tradition.

Books	3	44	50	N	N	Trying to Explain It All	The Great Divergence is a multi-causal explanation for the economic rise of Western Europe.  The book draws upon diverse existing accounts, including those that see the root causes within Europe itself, and those that see the causes as being related to overseas enterprises by the European powers.  However, the book goes beyond these existing accounts by offering a synthetic, multi-stage story, showing how each factor mattered at a certain point in time, but was not alone sufficient to trigger the rise of the West.  Thus, one comes away with a belief that the story of the West's ascendency cannot satisfactorily be told by Marx's focus on \\"primitive accumulation\\" in the New World, nor by North's focus on institutions of property rights in Europe, nor by Braudel's focus on intra-Europe trade and accumulation.<br /><br />What is the structure of Pomeranz's argument?  Again, it sees different factors as mattering at different times.  Thus, the argument is causally sequential, going from technology, to war, to colonization, to markets, with supplies of natural resources a constant bonus and an important final step to industrialization (coal).  All of these causes are necessary, for Pomeranz, but none are sufficient, explaining why Asia, despite having many of these same variables (some in even more favorable combinations than Europe), was not able to match Europe's rise.<br />Part 1 begins with the puzzle of \\"why Europe and not Asia?\\", going back to pre-1800 times.  Against those who would see crucial pre-industrial differences between the two regions, with Europe having some kind of proto-industrial edge, Pomeranz demonstrates with statistical and secondary evidence that Europe possessed no edge over Asia in either life expectancy, fertility, or supply of capital.  While he does find a slight technological edge in Europe, as other scholars have posited, he argues that this edge would not have alone been sufficient to cause Europe's rise, without the later use of favorable stocks of natural resources, and overseas conquest and exploitation.  Thus, the sequential nature of the argument comes in here, showing how an earlier technological edge, combined with later colonialism and accidents of natural resource endowment (e.g. coal), allowed Europe to escape the Malthusian trap of population growth under constrained resources.<br />Indeed, Pomeranz demonstrates that the \\"silverization\\" of the Chinese economy, coupled with slavery, plantations and precious metals extraction in the New World, were the only factors differentiating markets in Europe from those in Asia - otherwise, the relationship between consumers and goods was relatively similar in both regions.  Against Braudel and North, who emphasize economic institutions, Pomeranz shows that nonmarket factors like colonization and wars between European states, coupled with lending institutions that had lower interest rates than in Asia, laid the groundwork for the Industrial Revolution.  This groundwork wouldn't have mattered, however, if continued New World settlement didn't ease the growing scarcity of land, since more plentiful labor and capital would have been bottlenecked in the absence of a new land supply.<br /><br />The focus on nonmarket factors like war is important, because it ties in with later developments that impacted market forms.  Because states projected interstate rivalries overseas, according to Pomeranz, organizational forms like joint-stock companies and licensed monopolies arose.  This is because armed long-distance trade and export-oriented colonies required \\"exceptional amounts of capital willing to wait a relatively long time for returns\\" (20), which could only be provided by these new organizational forms.<br />However, the book is not a simplistic account that sees colonization as the sole solution, since Pomeranz spends an entire chapter showing how overseas colonies alone could not provide a market impetus for the Industrial Revolution, due mainly to the initially high costs of transport and low demand for manufactured goods in the colonies.  Instead, Pomeranz sees the growing use of coal as a key factor in spurring industrialization in Europe, and combining with increasing use of slavery (since slaves produced less subsistence products and thus lived more off imported, manufactured goods) to begin the construction of a world market that traded manufactured goods for raw materials and land-intensive products, while further easing Europe's ecological burden through continued settlement.<br />The New World had another advantage over Asia.  In Asia cash-cropping was through free labor, meaning that exporters and manufacturers were free to shift away from activities with diminishing returns.  This efficiency was a double-edged sword, however, since it allowed rising incomes and population growth, which Pomeranz claims diminished Asians' need to both import manufactured goods and to export surplus products.  In the case of China, well-functioning regional markets, because of growing population, scarce land, and proto-industrialization, precluded empire-wide markets that could take advantage of more scale and specialization.  In the New World, however, production was much more specialized (again, because of slave-based colonies), meaning that larger surpluses of people, raw materials and products were exchanged between the New World and Europe.  This dynamic of increasing returns continued even after independence and emancipation, leading eventually (with coal) to the Industrial Revolution.<br />Again, Pomeranz's argument is about timing as a key factor.  Since his Malthusian trap and balance between factors is delicate and fragile, if variables appear at the wrong historical time in this balance, their impact can go awry.  An example is the timing of coal and colonization, which, had they appeared later, might have come too late to rescue Europe from Malthusian crisis.  Methodologically, Pomeranz acheives much of his arguments about timing through counterfactuals, which generally do a good job of showing how Asia originally had much of the potentiality that Europe did, thus illuminating the large amount of sheer luck that factored into Europe's rise.<br /><br />Pomeranz's other methodological tool is statistical data.  The book has exhaustive appendices with detailed data on soil, timber, grain acreage, etc.  Further, the breadth of his historical scholarship is impressive, showing an ability to cite widely from area experts in both Asia and Europe; no mean feat.  In short, the high quality of the data, coupled with the reassuring, causally multidimensional sophistication of the argument, make the book a formidable target for any potential criticisms.tially high costs of transport and low demand for manufactured goods in the colonies.

An-Na'im's argument rests on the separation of \\"historical Shari'a\\" (often wrongly treated as if it were itself divine revelation) from the essence of Islam itself, as revealed by the early tenure of Mohammed in Mecca, before he moved to Medina and grappled with the difficult and immediate imperatives of political power.<br /><br />Like a good lawyer, An-Na'im's case in &quot;Toward an Islamic Reformation&quot; unfolds like a geometrical proof, proceeding deductively from an axiom (a universal principle of reciprocity) and reasoning from there; namely, that all peoples have rights of self-determination, as long as they don't clash with others' rights of self-determination.  To this norm, An-Na'im adds two sociological observations.  The first is that Muslim majorities are now becoming politically assertive, exercising their right to self-determination, which is in itself a healthy thing.  However, the second observation is that the hitherto weakened and disorganized condition of the Muslim community has usually been attributed to departure from \\"true\\" belief and practice, as well as to outside interference by non-Muslims.  Thus, An-Na'im reasons, secular solutions to social problems will not appeal to most Muslims.  Even the doctrine of necessity (darura) is not enough, although it has been used with some degree of success in the past, because only a truly Islamic solution will satisfy Muslim demands for self-determination.  Thus, any proposed reforms must be seen as Islamic in origin.<br />However, An-Na'im here makes a strong case that the implementation of \\"historical Shari'a\\" (he calls it historical, obviously, to emphasize its man-made, temporal quality), while seen as a solution by many (due to the yearning to go back to tradition), will likely oppress others, and limit their right to self-determination, because it conflicts with modern norms of constitutionalism, human rights, international law and criminal justice.  However, historical Shari'a was constructed by early jurists, written for a specific time and place, and does not come directly from revelation.  So, given that secular and Shari'a solutions both are inadequate, the question becomes: how can Muslims' rights vis-&agrave;-vis others be exercised, while also being legitimately limited in accordance with universal principles (and the earlier, more tolerant words of Mohammed)?<br />An-Na'im acknowledges that any attempt to answer this question and \\"evolve\\" alternative principles will be difficult, due to the likely suspicion that tampering with the weight of tradition will inflame, but must be done, and can be based directly on revelation.  This is the task that he sets himself to in the second half of the book, once he has demonstrated how Shari'a: 1) is man-made; 2) is non-divine; 3) originally arose for political expediency; 4) goes against the early word of Mohammed (much of which it \\"abrogated\\" under the doctrine of naskh); and 5) will likely violate the rights of non-Muslims, women, slaves, etc., and be incompatible with the very idea of the nation-state, international law, and human rights.  In this, An-Na'im is clearly a modernist, in that he takes the nation-state, etc. as a given, and holds that there are benefits from secularism that would be lost (self-expression, women, religious minorities, slavery) if Shari'a were to be implemented.  He also makes a very specific negative judgment about the application of Shari'a in today's \\"fundamentalist\\" states (Iran, Sudan), arguing that \\"it has created more problems than it has solved\\" (67).  While an \\"anti-imperialist\\" might take issue with this statement, arguing that the worst excesses of fundamentalism are preferable to \\"western\\" institutions, An-Na'im's mission is to make Islam palatable to western institutions, and vice-versa, by \\"rehabilitating\\" the \\"early Mohammed\\" in much the same way that neo-Marxists drew upon the \\"Young Marx\\" to get away from the stale determinism of scientific socialism.  Thus, the early Mohammed of the Mecca period is portrayed as a tolerant, \\"reasonable\\" leader, while the Mohammed of the Medina period, and the later rulers under whom Shari'a developed, were forced to adapt their ideas to the expediencies an extremely harsh, violent political world.<br />What is An-Na'im's program for rehabilitating Islam from the legacy of this world?  The four main areas of law concerned are constitutionalism (how can Islam reconcile itself to self-determination, but with limits on power?), criminal justice (how can Islam democratically enforce Islamic justice without violating the rights of non-Muslims?), international law (how can Islam reconcile itself to interactions between nation-states, some of whom will be non-Muslim?), and human rights (how can Islam leave behind the legacy of subordinate status for women, slaves and non-believers, and grant universal rights to all people?).<br />While the program is well-argued and eloquently framed, obviously drawing much inspiration from the mentorship of the Sudanese reformist martyr, Mahmoud Taha, An-Na'im himself, though an optimist, admits that the book is not likely to receive a warm reception in the Muslim world.  Though he doesn't admit it, part of the problem with this reception might be a feeling that he is engaged in sophist apologism for the West, finding parts of Islamic teaching to justify a wholesale adaptation to modern, secular developments.  For those Muslims who feel their identity under attack, and thus advocate a return to tradition, the particular tradition that An-Na'im cites might seem a bit too conveniently Western.  And after all, arguing that the Prophet went against his own early teachings out of expediency might seem unfathomable for one who believes that everything the Prophet did was divine!slam palatable to western institutions, and vice-versa, by \\"rehabilitating\\" the \\"early Mohammed\\" in much the same way that neo-Marxists drew upon the \\"Young Marx\\" to get away from the stale determinism of scientific socialism.

The book operates at three levels of analysis: religious text, religious authority/interpretation, and the broader cultures of Islamic societies.  Thus, to call the analysis \\"culturalist\\", while a crudely accurate labeling, does not capture the nuance of the book's important focus on Islamic theology itself, in addition to the ways in which this theology has interacted with culture directly through text, and indirectly through the ulema and other mediating forces.  Lewis often uses phrases like \\"according to Islamic law and tradition . . .\\" (67), without specifying the relative impact of law versus tradition.<br /><br />Obviously, the reader then sees immediately that Lewis' project leaves itself open to suspicions of Orientalism, reification, and other postmodern pathologies, not only because the book conspicuously implies that the Islamic world is \\"backward\\", inferring that progress equals some degree of Westernization,  but also because Lewis \\"essentializes\\" Islamic religion itself, treating religion as though it is a coherent, consistent factor throughout history.  Not only does this focus ignore political, economic, demographic and other accounts of problems such as poverty and autocracy in the Middle East, but it also provides an account of Islamic \\"backwardness\\" that blames fundamental problems within Islam itself, as opposed to any external force.  This is a highly controversial line of argument, and is sure to anger many.<br />Nonetheless, Lewis pushes on, drawing on history, text, and interpretation to trace the roots of the decline.  In doing so, he combines disparate strands of argument into a broad indictment of Islamic culture's ability to flexibly adapt to Western success and regain a position of relative power.  Speaking historically, his first strand of argument is the Muslim world's lack of curiosity about the West, coupled with a fatal case of civilizational over-confidence, due to its long historical zenith as the center of civilization and learning.  This lack of curiosity, Lewis admits, was more due to the actual status of superiority, and had little to do with Islamic culture itself.  Lewis seems to greatly respect the early achievements of the Islamic world.<br />However, religion truly comes into play as a negative force, for Lewis, when the Muslim world realizes that the West has gained the upper hand, and yet is unable to do anything about it.  Why does religion prevent the catching-up process?  Because Lewis argues that religious authorities, \\"classical jurists\\" in his terms (36), ruled that Muslims could not live among the infidels, thus obviously blocking the necessary technical, scientific and educational exchanges that could have transferred some of the West's learning to the Middle East.  Muslims were prevented from learning from Christians by their own theological prejudices, prejudices which Christians lacked, or at least were able to overcome by necessarily traveling to the Holy Land, trading, learning Middle Eastern languages, etc.  Lewis also argues that a recurring theme in Muslim discourse is blaming the decline of the Muslim world on having strayed from religion itself: \\"if things are going badly, we are being punished by God for having abandoned the true path\\" (45).  This has led to a social re-trenchment of religious tradition, of course, which for Lewis only exacerbates the problem of backwardness.  Thus, Islamic societies are caught in a vicious cycle, because they attempt to address their backwardness with more of the very factor that made them backward in the first place.<br />Another factor is the Muslim attitude towards science itself.  Lewis claims that, for Muslims, \\"philosophy was the handmaiden of theology and science merely a collection of pieces of knowledge and devices\\" (46).  This argument is problematic, however, because it doesn't explain the flourishing of science and secular knowledge under the Muslim golden age.  Thus, the danger of arguments like this is that they treat religion as an unchanging, timeless force, obviously losing sight of important interactions between religious interpretation and real-world events, through which religious law and culture can be changed over time.<br />More blame gets parceled out to the subordinated role of women in Islamic law, tradition and culture.  Again, the reader isn't sure how much these forces stem from theology, and how much from the broader society.  Lewis attributes the lesser status of slave, woman, and unbeliever to \\"revelation\\", \\"the precept and practice of the prophet\\", and \\"the classical and scriptural history of the Islamic community\\" (84).  While the first two are certainly theological, one might argue that the third variable could be entirely cultural, shaped by economics, politics and demography, and have little to do with actual sacred texts.  Thus, even if we follow Lewis on this point regarding the status of women, we wonder why similar revelations regarding the role of women in Christian theology are not so zealously enforced.  Obviously the rise of secularism in the West is responsible for the liberated status of women, and Lewis has a theological cultural story for why secularism has not taken root in the Middle East: \\"certain profound differences of belief and experience in the two religious cultures\\", such as different \\"foundation myths\\" (100).  Again, we are not sure if a \\"religious culture\\" is the same thing as an entire culture whose members happen to practice the same religion, at least nominally, or whether it is something much more narrow and specific.  Are all nominal Muslims part of Islamic religious culture?  Lewis seems to imply that they are.  Thus, in the final analysis, Lewis' ambiguity keeps him from sounding dangerously simplistic.  However, this game becomes too much of a stretch, even for his considerable talents, when he audaciously argues on page 156 that it is not \\"plausible\\" to blame Islam itself for the decline of the Middle East, as if he had been doing anything else for the previous 155 pages!nd secular knowledge under the Muslim golden age.

While the first two factors explain the political appeal of Islamism to \\"the masses\\", the third factor explains much of the violence that has in turn sprung from Islamism.<br />This account obviously goes against the two main conventional explanations for political Islam:  materialism and theology.  Against those like Bernard Lewis, who would argue that political Islam springs directly from the texts and laws of the religion, Burgat makes the case that Islamist individuals have themselves created political Islam, to serve social needs, rather than Islam creating them.  In other words, Islam is a device to be used for emancipation from domination - the religion does not mold \\"fundamentalists\\" in its image.  Islamists are not directly inspired by actual religious doctrine or belief.  Burgat feels that if \\"theologists\\" like Lewis actually talked to Islamists, they might come away with a different viewpoint.<br />Burgat's account also goes against those that would seek explanations for the rise of political Islam in poverty and underdevelopment alone.  While Burgat cannot ignore the additional force of poverty in pushing recruits into the arms of Islamism, he eschews a materialist approach even for this dynamic, arguing instead that the lack of meaningful unemployment alienates one from one's true identity - \\"who am I, if I am not given the right to exist by working?\\" (21).  Thus, poverty only exacerbates (but doesn't cause) the identity crisis that Burgat sees as fomenting political Islam.<br /><br />But what is the actual nature of the \\"authentic\\" Muslim identity that is in crisis?  Burgat never really offers a concrete definition of its content, other than a continual narrative of Islamism as a new nationalism (a reincarnation of an older Arab nationalism, he says at one point), which grants to the Arab \\"a beneficial reconciliation with the categories (real or mythical, it is not important) of the culture he lives in intuitively\\" (50).  Thus, the categories are not defined, and the content seems unimportant for Burgat.  It doesn't even matter if it's real.  What is more important is the \\"vocabulary or terminology based on local references\\", and the \\"precious symbolic continuity interrupted by . . . Western categories\\" (50).  Thus, the argument seems to be a post-modern kind of process-based, discourse-based argument, using symbols and language as key variables in defining identity and difference.<br />But not only does this \\"precious symbolic continuity\\" have a rather utopian quality to it, but we are not sure of the actual benefits of the reconciliation.  What is gained?  Dignity?  Is this some kind of psychic therapy?  One answer is offered by one of the Islamists that Burgat interviews, who, while undergoing a personal transformation from socialist to Islamist in Egypt, realized that \\"if I feel tied to these people in many ways, that must mean we share a common culture, and this culture should be infinitely more respected than it is at the moment [under Nasser]\\" (41).  Acting on this feeling of tied-ness is presumably what Burgat means by reconciliation (one shudders to imagine a rational choice scholar attempting to calculate a utility function based on \\"symbolic continuity\\" and reconciliation with intuitive cultural categories!).<br /><br />So if we are to believe Burgat that Islamism is just organic nationalism, why should the West fear this social change?  Is nationalism inherently chauvinistic?  Burgat makes a strong case that political Islam's violence is itself a response to state repression and violence, carried out by unrepresentative leaders who are propped up by the West.  The West itself props up these leaders, and turns a blind eye to their savage tactics, partly because the West is fed a steady diet of distorted media, in which reporters focus on a few tidbits that reinforce conventional stereotypes of Islamists, while selectively framing what little positive information that leaks through (about possible moderation by Islamists) as mere political ploys to gain power.  Burgat implies that some Islamists may not recognize the universality of democratic rights, but only because they have never themselves been granted these rights.  How can one be a democrat when one's government routinely makes a mockery of democracy?  Thus, being anti-democratic has become a symbolic marker of identity assertion against the West, which sadly reinforces the West's perceptions of Islamists.<br />The book has a hopeful theme, however, which is the future likelihood of Islamism adapting to modernity.  Burgat seems to feel that Islamism has within itself the seeds of this adaptation, once it has gone through a seemingly necessary phase of self-definition free from Western \\"categories\\".  Indeed, several of the Islamists interviewed seem to show a strain that we would simplistically call \\"moderate\\"; namely, seemingly mocking people that read only the Koran, disapproving of people who are \\"dogmatic\\", etc.  And the strongest real-world case for this potential future adaptation, of course, is Iran, where a terrifying \\"Islamist\\" government was (after a rough transition, to be sure) able to achieve something that no pro-Western (thus ostensibly pro-democratic!) Muslim government could do: achieve a peaceful transfer of power at the ballot box.  But why should we expect that Islamism would necessarily adapt to modernity?  Burgat's explanation is that after taking power, Islamism would lose its utopian quality (the ideological shine that comes from being in opposition), and would be forced to adapt to social reality.  Thus, political Islam might just be like socialism and secular nationalism, another passing political fad.tic?

In this book Mr. Van Evera introduces the reader to the gospel of arrow diagraming, in which all political science theories must be drawn as letters, representing variables, with arrows (representing causality) connecting them.  Thus, to quote Van Evera, &quot;a theory that cannot be arrow-diagrammed is not a theory and needs reframing to become a theory.&quot;  Thus, by his measure, much of the poli sci &quot;theories&quot; are not theories at all.  So what are GOOD theories, for van Evera, besides those that are easily arrow-diagramed?<br />Theories are general statements that describe and explain the causes or effects of classes of phenomena.  They are composed of causal laws or hypotheses, explanations, and antecedent conditions.  Explanations are also composed of causal laws or hypotheses, which are in turn composed of dependent and independent variables.  A good theory has 7 characteristics: it has large explanatory power (importance, explanatory range, applicability), and is parsimonious, satisfying, clearly framed, falsifiable, explains important phenomena, and has &quot;prescriptive richness.&quot;<br />In short, the book might teach newbies a thing or two about methodological rigor and research design, but is certainly no model of sophistication.  In fact, the book is a perfect example of why American political &quot;science&quot; is sometimes mocked by the rest of the academic world.	2002-03-15

This is an appealing idea if one believes in a perfectly functioning political system characterized by eternal balance.  However, the actual attainment of this goal is only plausible if one grants Plato both his moral conception of human nature and his conception of the existence of \\"pure forms\\" of earthly things in heaven.  In other words, Platonic justice rests on platonic psychology and platonic theology.  Take away these arguments, and his case for justice is pure rhetoric, based on inaccurate descriptions of political reality and a dangerous defense of elitism by emphasizing men's \\"roles\\" and \\"crafts\\" over their free will and liberty.  But even this elitist rhetoric must be taken seriously, for it has attracted numerous adherents and affected society in dramatically positive ways over the last 2000 years.  Negative liberties and mutual Hobbesian suspicion alone cannot build a society.  Furthermore, elitist criticisms can be made of any society, including any of our nominally democratic modern regimes.  Plato is merely up front about his elitism.  Why should we criticize him for that?	2002-03-15

Foremost among these issues is the actual role of the political philosopher in society and in history.  Indeed, Marx is directly referring to the legacy of his Hegelian contemporaries when he says that \\"philosophers have only interpreted the world . . . the point, however, is to change it.\\"<br />Marx departs from Hegel and his latter-day followers (whether revolutionary or conservative) in both method and in goals.  As far as methodology is concerned, Marx is an empiricist of a certain normatively world-changing brand, which obviously leaves him open to critiques from \\"pure\\" empiricism as being either an outright determinist (an obviously abhorrent concept to the entire Humean tradition) or else being merely a moral philosopher in scientist's clothing.<br />As for goals, while some of Hegel's followers might share a certain revolutionary telos with Marx, they cannot truly be his comrades because for Marx the revolutionary method (historical materialism) is inseparable from the revolutionary goal (communism); that is, communism cannot by nature be an \\"ideal\\" . . . \\"to which reality will have to adjust itself\\"  (as it is for the Hegelians).  Instead, the ideal of communism must adjust itself to reality (thus becoming no longer an ideal), and that is precisely Marx's project as expressed in the 11th Thesis on Feuerbach:  through his writings, to \\"adjust\\" the real world to his view of the way it's going to be (by writing about the world the way that it has been, and the way that it is now).	2002-03-15

Hobbes' argument reads like a geometrical proof, which goes something like:<br />We take it as a given that people, like Galilean celestial bodies, are in perpetual motion, moved by appetites for power.  The power of a person is his or her present means to obtain some future good.  Every person's power resists and hinders the effects of other people's power.  Thus, if all people are created equal in a hypothetical state of nature, then:<br />1. From equality proceeds mutual fear.<br />2. From mutual fear proceeds warfare.<br />3. In such warfare, nothing is unjust.<br />4. But reason suggests a better way to self-preservation (to peace):  the right and laws of nature.<br />5. The right of nature is the liberty we have to use our power for self-preservation.<br />6. The 1st law of nature is that we ought to strive for peace, but when we cannot obtain it then it's war.<br />7. The 2nd law of nature is that in the interests of peace we will lay down our natural right to give us as much liberty as we would allow others to have against us (the golden rule).<br />8. This mutual laying down of our natural right is a social contract.<br />9. There must be a coercive power (the commonwealth) to enforce this contract.<br />10. The commonwealth is ruled by a sovereign who embodies the will of the people and is granted certain inalienable rights to enforce the social contract.<br />In short, those who fear authority (anarchists, libertarians, etc.) will revile Hobbes, because of power's potential for abuse, but Hobbes would argue that a true Leviathan could never abuse its subjects because it is actually made up of those same subjects (in other words, a roundabout defense of liberal democracy).	2002-03-11

According to my reading, this new model is characterized by an emphasis on incentive constrains (structures/institutions) and a dynamic process of learning (both individual and collective).<br />But here North runs into a problem with the infamous structure/agency dichotomy.  That is, he means to rise above methodological individualism by incorporating a broad, deterministic social &quot;structure&quot; into his analysis -- &quot;by structure I mean those characteristics of a society which we believe to be the basic determinants of performance&quot; (3).  However, he also seems to chalk a great deal of explanatory power up to individual leadership, calculation and rationality:  the state specifying rules of the game to maximize rents (24) and also:  &quot;throughout history, individuals given a choice between a state-however exploitative it might be-and anarchy, have decided for the former&quot; (24).  But if there's such a powerful structure, then can individuals really &quot;choose&quot; their fate?  How much leeway is there for strategic calculation?  On page 32 he seems to say that the masses have no power to choose:  &quot;institutional innovation will always come from rulers rather than constituents since the latter would always face the free rider problem&quot;.  Is North's structure (and institutions) merely an aggregation of the choices of masses of agents, or is it the strategic choices of a few ruling principals and their agents, or is it the evolution of an impersonal body of culture, ideas, law, etc., or is it all three?  And if it's all three, then is he trying to incorporate too much into the concept of &quot;institutions&quot;, until they become tautological?  What CANNOT be an institution under his definition, and if everything is an institution, then how can we formulate testable, falsifiable hypotheses about social change?<br />North defines institutions as &quot;the humanly devised constrains that construct human interaction&quot; (p. 344); or, the rules of the game in a society.  Thus, it is clear that North is trying to provide an explanation of the dynamic interaction among many factors, which is always a difficult task.  But he is to be commended for modifying neoclassical thought in this provocative new way, potentially opening a path for a whole new research agenda in the social sciences.eses about social change?  <br />North defines institutions as &quot;the humanly devised constrains that construct human interaction&quot; (p. 344); or, the rules of the game in a society.

This broadened potential for success arises from the often-underestimated utility of non-economic, security-based outcomes, such as signaling other nations about strategic intentions and commitments.  Thus, by his argument, we should judge the U.S. sanctions against Iraq or Cuba as successes, not as the failures they are commonly held to be.<br />He writes that \\"mutually beneficial exchange relationships . . . should be viewed in terms of power\\" (xi).  For Baldwin, we should see economics not as a voluntary market structure that freely distributes goods, but should instead see the market as \\"an instrument of politics\\" (3).  Any time that economics is used as an instrument of international politics, he calls it \\"economic statecraft,\\" which Baldwin defines as \\"governmental influence attempts relying primarily on resources that have a reasonable semblance of a market price in terms of money\\" (30).<br />Although he sees economic statecraft as relying upon economic resources, the desired results should not necessarily be viewed in economic terms.  He instead conceptualizes the results of economic statecraft quite broadly, as being \\"influence attempts,\\" which means that they try to influence the behavior of other states  in any way, economic or otherwise.  It is this contention around which the importance of Baldwin's entire argument hinges, for it is this broadening of the intended results of economic statecraft to include all \\"influence attempts\\" that leads him to conclude that \\"the utility of economic techniques of statecraft has been systematically underestimated because of inadequacies in the analytical frameworks used to make such estimates\\" (58).<br />What does Baldwin have in mind when he emphasizes non-economic types of influence?  When we think of economic sanctions, one key tool of economic statecraft, he reminds us that \\"the particular state with which trade is embargoed may or may not be the primary target of the influence attempt\\" (17).  Here he draws our attention to the broader strategic context of international relations, by reminding us of the importance of onlookers in strategic interaction between two states.  Analysts commonly use the concept of \\"signaling\\" to describe the mutual perceptions among participants and onlookers in a particular strategic interaction.  \\"Economic sanctions may be effective not because of their economic impact, which may be nil, but rather because of the signal they send about the intentions of the state imposing the sanctions\\" (24).  These signals can have a variety of effects, both positive and negative, that will structure future strategic calculations and interactions.  Economic sanctions \\"may trigger a sense of shame, impose a sense of isolation from the world community, signal a willingness to use more radical measures, or simply provoke reexamination of policy stances in the target country\\" (63).  The strength of Baldwin's argument here is that it breaks ground into areas that liberal accounts cannot tread by virtue of their reliance upon the imperatives of voluntary exchange implicit in the market.  By going past this limitation, Baldwin shows how state agents can structure world power by manipulating the choices, capabilities and payoffs that other actors possess, and thereby shape the matrix of incentives.y tool of economic statecraft, he reminds us that \\"the particular state with which trade is embargoed may or may not be the primary target of the influence attempt\\" (17).

She terms the 1980s as Africa's \\"lost decade,\\" and views development strategies of economic growth that ignore social and consequences as being politically destabilizing.  But her conception of the triggering mechanism for this destabilization is much different from that of most traditional political scientists (like Samuel Huntington's, for instance) perhaps owing to the different historical contexts in which they write (the institution-building of the 1960s versus the institutional decay of the 1990s).<br />Huntington and other past scholars posit that under conditions of economic stimulus in a modernizing society, social mobilization is the trigger for destabilization.  Hibou, however, points to the nature of the African state itself as being responsible for political instability under conditions of economic stimulus.  In other words, neoliberal market stimulus fails in Africa not because of mobilized citizens whose demands cannot be met, but because of the complex nature of the African state.<br />What is Hibou's conception of the African state, and how does it differ from Huntington's?  Huntington tends to see the state in terms of how \\"institutionalized\\" it is, with a well-institutionalized state presumably having well-functioning formal political institutions that are adaptable, complex, autonomous and coherent.  Hibou, however, goes far beyond a conventional political science view of institutions, by conceptualizing the African state as a \\"shadow\\" state:<br />\\"the relationships, institutions and people most prominently in public view are not necessarily the most powerful. Elements which at first sight appear to be obstacles to the functioning of the state may turn out, on closer inspection, actually to belong to the state . . . via a web of informal concessions, carefully negotiated privileges - notably including impunity for economic offences - and personal and political relationships\\" (88-89).<br />Accordingly, Hibou argues that neoliberalism has failed in Africa because it fails to take account of the state's informal shadow as an economic actor.  In seeking to tie the hands of formal state actors to prevent conventional \\"rent-seeking\\" behavior, neoliberals have given more power to the informal sector, which tends to engage in economic activity that may not only be \\"rent-seeking,\\" but also \\"criminal\\" by many standards.  Neoliberalism thus destroys formal institutions in Africa, and encourages \\"the development of personal networks, of informal or even illegal practices\\" (93).<br />Thus, unlike Huntington's theory that social mobilization coupled with economic inequality destabilizes developing polities, Hibou posits instead that the nature of African states should be given prime explanatory weight in showing why economic stimulus might produce results opposite to those intended.relationships\\" (88-89).<br />Accordingly, Hibou argues that neoliberalism has failed in Africa because it fails to take account of the state's informal shadow as an economic actor.

In short, his argument is that the functional complexity of post-medieval Europe went hand-in-hand with a sublimation of man's baser instincts.  Upon first glance, the reader immediately wonders about the relevance of findings such as \\"in medieval society people generally blew their noses into their hands\\" (126).  The dominant explanations for the rise of the modern nation-state have usually been based in economics (Marx, Polanyi, Moore, North &amp; Thomas) and not in the sort of etiquette, manners and social customs that are the key operating concepts in Elias' work.  However, Elias makes a convincing case that such customs deserve predominant explanatory weight, being vehicles of social control that lay the psychological groundwork for the nation-state.  Such a finding helps political scientists answer the persistent question of why Western political institutions fail when placed into unfamiliar Third-World social environments.  Most analysts have chalked this up to unequal economic development, but Elias would probably favor an argument emphasizing the lack of a \\"civilizing\\" process in Third-World societies.  Such an explanation--like Putnam's reasoning in revealing Southern Italy's \\"civic culture\\" to be bankrupt--is admittedly open to criticism of essentialism, cultural determinism, and other postmodern shortcomings, but at a minimum, it certainly alerts us to pertinent, non-economic variables at work in the development-democracy relationship.<br />Elias selects three comparative cases, France, England and Germany, and performs a content analysis of medieval texts on manners, etiquette, and the transformation of the nobility from warriors into courtiers.  These texts are the empirical evidence offered for his key variable, pan-European courtly manners delineated by social structure (classes and \\"monopolies\\" of power).  The other key variable (it's rather unclear which one is \\"dependent\\" on the other) is the rise of the nation-state, which was brought about by an exogenous variable (population growth) as well as two intervening factors:  1) the decline of the nobility relative to national absolutism (both economically and militarily); and 2) the rise of a money economy.  Elias shows how centrifugal forces in these societies (mainly the warrior-noble class) resisted the \\"integration\\" of absolutism/nationhood, but that these forces in the end were overcome by economics coupled with the centripetal social groundwork of pan-European \\"civilite\\" and social customs, leading to an increasingly complex interweaving of social functions.  \\"Society was `in transition' . . . `Simplicity' . . . had been lost.  People saw things with more differentiation\\" (61).  \\"Social control was becoming more binding . . . with the structural transformation of society . . . a change slowly came about: the compulsion to check one's own behaviour\\" (70).<br />The near totality of Elias' evidence is qualitative, often selected from medieval writings and secondhand observations.  Although he means to proceed inductively from these facts, Elias often reads like a deductive historian, especially when positing lawlike generalizations such as \\"the more or less sudden emergence of words within languages nearly always points to changes in the lives of people themselves, particularly when the new concepts are destined to become as central and long-lived as these\\" (48).  In fact, his entire thesis can be summarized with another of his apparently deductive axioms: \\"The growth of units of integration and rule is always at the same time an expression of structural changes in society, that is to say, in human relationships\\" (254).  Marxists, of course, would say that such social changes are themselves dependent upon changes in the relations of production, but Elias gives equal weight to social causes as to economic ones.  The economy is by no means neglected in his analysis, since he gives currency, demand for property, and population growth prime explanatory roles in his causal process (despite the fact that there is no quantitative evidence given for these socioeconomic correlations, unlike the analysis of the same topics by North &amp; Thomas).  However, Marxists would surely have a fit over Elias' assertion that the civilizing process leads to a wholesale leveling of distinctions between social classes (430), as well as his claim that the modern state arose out of a virtual stalemate between the bourgeois and the nobility (327).<br />On the topic of state-society relations, Elias makes the provocative argument that for the past 300 years,  \\"monopoly rulers\\" (including, but not limited to, absolutist kings) are mere functionaries, with the real power resting in the hands of their \\"subjects\\" (271).  \\"Control of the centralized institutions themselves is so dispersed that it is difficult to discern clearly who are the rulers and who are the ruled\\" (315).  Of course, under an instable balance of power (including today's Third World) the playing field is presumably up for grabs between different classes and parts of the state, but in a developed society, Elias would argue that the internalization of \\"civilized\\" norms means that the \\"strong\\" state, while resting on a cohesive social order, is not as autonomous from social forces as one might think.t Elias gives equal weight to social causes as to economic ones.

US	50835042	R2JCX9LXNP7USH	0691003998	339841763	Debt, Development, and Democracy	Books	3	11	11	N	N	&quot;Modern Political Economy&quot; in Latin America	Frieden's &quot;Debt, Development and Democracy&quot; is a rational-choice analysis of economic group interests (the &quot;demand side&quot; of political economy) in Latin America that seeks to explain widely differing political and economic outcomes in five countries who faced nearly identical external economic conditions.  By holding the external financial environment (foreign lending) constant across the five cases, Frieden can explain two kinds of divergent outcomes (economic policy and political change) through his independent variable:  the political interaction of economic interest groups acting rationally vis-a-vis the state to maximize their interests.<br /> Frieden's argument rests on the assumption that foreign loans were liked a pie to be divided.  When the pie was large, during the lending spree of 1965-1982, economic interest groups in each of the five countries determined the distribution of the pie based on their political competition for capital.  Since these groups were acting to maximize their economic interests, Frieden analyzes these interests in order to explain their impact on the first dependent variable:  economic policy during the borrowing period.  He finds that the most significant factor determining interests was the nature of national labor-capital relations.  In the three cases where labor-capital relations were calm (Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil) various &quot;sectors&quot; of the economy squabbled over the pie, resulting in interventionist economic policy and political cleavages that cut across the labor-capital divide.  The winners in this battle for government largesse were the economic sectors that were strongest in two key areas:  asset specificity and concentrated organization.  But in the two cases where labor-capital relations were contentious, (Argentina and Chile) Frieden shows that capitalists across all sectors recognized their common interest and refrained from sectoral squabbling by forcing the state to eschew interventionism and protect the business climate by liberalizing markets.<br />After 1982, when the pie began to shrink, it was the nature of these established interest group/state relationships that determined Frieden's second dependent variable:  each country's political response to the financial crisis.  In the 3 sectoral countries, plus Argentina (where class conflict had subsided and sectoral cleavages therefore rose to prominence), the politically powerful sectors realized their common interest by joining forces to overthrow the regime or government (or the &quot;policy orientation&quot; in the case of one-party Mexico) that could no longer protect their economic interests.  But in Chile, where class conflict still seethed, Frieden argues that the entire business community made a rational choice to maintain its pro-regime stance, feeling that they had more to fear from a resurgence of the left than they did from the government's inability to meet their economic demands.  This explains the fact that Chile is the book's only case where authoritarianism survived the debt crisis.<br />Frieden offers two kinds of evidence to test his theory:  quantitative and qualitative.  The qualitative evidence, showing the behavior of interest groups vis-a-vis the state, is made up of interviews with key players in each of the five countries, plus numerous citations from other studies, both historical and contemporary, that ostensibly use qualitative data.  The quantitative data is primarily made up of statistics on Frieden's key antecedent condition, foreign lending (to illustrate the similar nature of debt conditions across the five cases) and also his economic dependent variable:  well-organized and asset-specific sectors pushing for state intervention in the economy (to illustrate the fact that sectoral economies spent their foreign loans in statist ways, while the two other cases spent their money in more &quot;liberal&quot; ways).  Fewer statistics are needed for Frieden's political dependent variable, political change after the debt crisis, since most observers would agree that Chile changed much less than the other cases (although some would say that Frieden's &quot;policy orientation&quot; variable in Mexico is meaningless, since the PRI never lost its grip on power.  But if Frieden were to admit that Mexico did not experience political change after the debt crisis, then his argument would be falsified).<br />Frieden makes it easy to assess the logical completeness of his rational choice argument by himself bringing up possible alternative theoretical interpretations of his data.  While this is an admirable attempt at fair and open social science, it also gives us easy access to the deficiencies of his approach.  Frieden himself admits that the behavior of interest groups cannot account for all changes in political economy, but then goes on to assert that &quot;trends toward or away from democracy are largely a function of political actors' evaluation of which institutional arrangement will best serve their interests, not of structural characteristics of developing societies&quot; (137).  While this is a bold statement, it robs all other variables (international economic conditions, institutions, the state, ideology, strategic interaction, etc.) of too much of their explanatory power.  To argue that economic interest groups alone can determine the nature of economic policy and the extent of political change is an overstatement of their individual capabilities, and Frieden probably knows it.  Rational choice assumes too much omnipotence on the part of particular groups and individuals, and too much power to act in their collective interests.  Nonetheless, Frieden's explanation is parsimonious, and sheds much light on heretofore ignored factors in the development/democracy relationship.l dependent variable, political change after the debt crisis, since most observers would agree that Chile changed much less than the other cases (although some would say that Frieden's &quot;policy orientation&quot; variable in Mexico is meaningless, since the PRI never lost its grip on power.

But very few people know the conservative political agenda that lies at the root of such anti-legalism.  &quot;Law and Community&quot; succeeds as political science because it reveals the political (class, racial, etc.) motives behind the anti-legalism of &quot;insiders&quot; in 3 American towns who deride outsiders (poor, working class, non-religious) folks as being &quot;sue-happy&quot; and &quot;out for a quick buck&quot;.  In short, America vilifies these individuals, who sue companies for negligence, because the pro-business social fabric of our towns is built on a foundation of rugged, self-reliant individualism that says not to blame anybody else for your problems.<br />However, this traditional brand of individualism can be contrasted with another type of individualism, equally as &quot;American&quot; in origin, that says that disadvantaged people have certain &quot;rights&quot;, including a &quot;right&quot; to assert these rights in a fair court of law.  But in the 3 towns in this book, outsiders who assert these rights against small businesspeople are ostracized from the community and rarely given a fair hearing within the supposedly impartial legal system itself.  However, when the towns' insiders wish to take their problems to court, to defend their contracts, leases, etc., we see a double standard in operation.  Insiders use law successfully, when it suits their interests, and then villify others that wish to use law against them.  The book does a great job of revealing this political cleavage, through detailed case studies, interviews and ethnographic research.<br />As mentioned above, my two biggest critiques are the poor organization of the book (almost a third of it is either overlap or fluff) and the tendency of the 3 authors, like many anthropologists, to cloak their otherwise interesting references into a postmodern fog of Foucault references and fancy cultural studies terms that will only turn off the undergraduate reader and give them a headache.  But if you can handle these two problems, this book makes great material for a course in law, anthropology, political science, sociology, or any combination thereof.ses, etc., we see a double standard in operation.

Second, there is a travel guide and a history of Colombia's aging, decrepit railroad system, which will truly fascinate only railroad buffs, but is moderately interesting reading for the rest of us.  And finally, there is a family history centered on the author's British grandfather, Leslie Frost, the man who guided the construction of the Colombian rail system half a century ago.  These sections are the least interesting, unless the idea of meeting long-lost relatives from other countries really gets you going.<br />Smith's book starts slowly, meandering through snapshots of Grandpa and rickety train rides through jungles, but by the time he hits Medellin and begins discussing the drug trade, the civil war, and the fortunes of the Colombian national soccer team, the book &quot;gathers steam&quot; (no pun intended) and hits a pretty good pace.  I recommend &quot;Cocaine Train&quot; for any train buffs, family history buffs, Latin American buffs, soccer buffs, cocaine buffs(?) or curious people in general.  Just be prepared to skim through a few slow parts and the book should be great reading.	2001-04-25

The obvious implication of this statement is that prosperous middle classes can only &quot;develop&quot; under authoritarian regimes, and in the meantime they cannot afford the luxury of having &quot;confidence&quot; in their own freedoms.  And since all too many contemporary scholars and policymakers subscribe to this view, Amartya Sen has made it his job to detail how and why development actually has a better chance of arising under democracy than under authoritarianism, and why developing-world citizens should have &quot;confidence&quot; in freedom's value, regardless of their economic situation.<br /> But what is freedom's value, to Sen?  Not only does it have normative and intrinsic importance as a social good, but it also has an instrumental or &quot;consequential&quot; role that provides political incentives for economic security (thus helping the operation of the market and leading to economic development), as well as having a constructive role in the &quot;genesis of values and priorities,&quot; which is the kind of substantive, social development that Sen sees as an essential companion to economic growth.  This development is conceptualized as the five benefits of freedom:  political freedoms, economic facilities, social opportunities, transparency guarantees, and protective security.<br /> As an economist, Sen does not, of course, neglect the role of the economy in the freedom/development causal process.  On the contrary, Sen makes use of Adam Smith for his own purposes, though admittedly giving Smith a more &quot;social&quot; spin than most neoclassical economists by focusing on Smith's views of education, political freedoms, and the social context of the market.  Sen accuses Smith's followers of myopically focusing on technocratic economic incentives for &quot;development&quot; and therefore being blind to the kind of &quot;political incentives&quot; that freedom can provide to a developing nation.  Deftly using the Asian examples often touted by his foes, Sen argues that Japan, South Korea, etc. made large investments in social opportunity freedoms like literacy and health care before their economies boomed.  In other words, sociopolitical development precedes economic development, and not the other way around.<br /> Theoretically, Sen formulates a kind of modified, &quot;deepened&quot; rational choice theory, arguing that a truly rational social choice depends on an adequate &quot;informational base&quot; in society, which only his five benefits of freedom can provide. This use of the incentive-based rational language of orthodox economics makes Sen's critique of authoritarianism all the stronger, showing why a lack of freedoms might impede the workings of the market (by limiting the information available to rational choosers), despite the best-intentioned, purely economic incentives that might be given to an unfree population.<br /> The bulk of Sen's evidence comes from political theory, economics and personal knowledge.  Much of his causal process-tracing lacks step-by-step empirical illustrations for each link, being that this is not exclusively a work of social science, but the book as a whole is inconsistently rich with empirical justification.  Indeed, it cites liberally from a large body of literature, and also draws upon a great deal of quantitative indicators for development, tracing such factors as life expectancy, GDP, infant mortality, gender disparities, and literacy rates.<br /> The easiest critique of Sen's work is that it is nothing more than a nobly futile plea to the development policymakers and corporate players; a plea that will most likely cause them to nod their heads, say &quot;yes, he's right, that sounds great . . . that's the way it should be,&quot; but then to push ahead anyway with their technocratic, economics-based sidestepping of the role of freedom in development.  Indeed, when one discovers that &quot;Development as Freedom&quot; has been lauded by such influential figures as the World Bank President and &quot;Business Week&quot; Magazine, then one immediately suspects that something is wrong.  If the World Bank and global corporate elites agree with Sen, then why aren't they pushing his recommendations more aggressively?  The answer is that most development players have an interest in keeping Sen's freedoms at bay.  Sen might argue that these players need to read his book and realize that their objective, long-term interests actually lie in pushing freedoms (longer life, healthcare, education, etc.), but the immediate pursuit of such freedoms is a hard sell to the struggling factory owner or the finance minister under pressure from the IMF.  Long-term interests have rarely figured into the real, ground-level process of market-driven development, and there's no reason to expect that this unfortunate state can be changed anytime soon.  Development is driven by multinational corporations who favor a &quot;liberal&quot; investment climate made up of fiscal restraint, a restraint that tends (in practice) to divert resources and attention from the kinds of freedoms that Sen proposes.ates.<br /> The easiest critique of Sen's work is that it is nothing more than a nobly futile plea to the development policymakers and corporate players; a plea that will most likely cause them to nod their heads, say &quot;yes, he's right, that sounds great . . . that's the way it should be,&quot; but then to push ahead anyway with their technocratic, economics-based sidestepping of the role of freedom in development.

The central concept of Putnam's study is &quot;institutions,&quot; but he frames these institutions as both an independent and a dependent variable.  Positing that institutions shape politics, but institutions themselves are shaped by history, Putnam is able to explain both the causes and the effects of political institutions among Italian regions.  The &quot;effects&quot; portion of his study is the lesser of the two in importance; basically, the fact that all Italian regions got identical institutions in 1970, and yet the performance of these institutions varied widely across Italy, sheds much doubt on the questionable theory that formal institutional design itself is a primary determinant of government performance (although most Italians North and South agree that the new regional governments have been a change for the better).<br />But if institutional design has limited explanatory power, then what other variable can better account for institutional performance?  This is the more important half of Putnam's work, for it is where he shows that &quot;social context and history profoundly condition the effectiveness of institutions&quot; (182), by unveiling his more controversial and powerful independent variable:  civic culture.  What is civic culture?  It goes by many names and concepts for Putnam (civic traditions, political culture, civic involvement, social capital, republican virtues) but in its most basic form it is &quot;norms of reciprocity and networks of civic engagement&quot; (167).<br />In contrast with the existence of this civic culture in Northern Italy, identified as having a millenium-long pedigree due to the North's highly decentralized political history, Putnam uses the concept of &quot;amoral familism&quot; to characterize the civic culture (or lack thereof) in Southern Italy.  Amoral familism implies that reciprocity and engagement are limited to family relations and to vertical networks of hierarchical power alone (in contrast to more participatory and egalitarian horizontal networks in the North), and that all other social relations, as a consequence, are characterized by material self-interest.  Tracing the evolution of amoral familism to Southern Italy's monarchical past, Putnam finds that Southern regions have been doomed to institutional failure by their civic legacy, just as the North was guaranteed a relatively easy success by theirs.  Putnam summarizes these two divergent starting points as &quot;vicious and virtuous circles that have led to contrasting, path-dependent social equilibria&quot; (180).<br />To prove this main causal argument, that civic culture determines institutional performance, one would obviously need adequate measures for both civic culture and institutional performance.  As evidence of institutional performance, or &quot;good government,&quot; Putnam chooses twelve indicators:  cabinet stability, budget promptness, statistical and information services, reform legislation, legislative innovation, day care centers, family clinics, industrial policy instruments, agricultural spending capacity, local health unit expenditures, housing and urban development and bureaucratic responsiveness.  Putnam then further evaluates the validity of these indicators by surveying both elite and public opinions regarding the institutional performance of their regional governments, to see if the public's perception matches his own.<br />For evidence of his primary independent variable, civic culture, Putnam proposes four indicators to put his finger on this elusive entity.  These indicators are: voluntary associations, newspaper readership, referenda turnout, and (lack of) personalized preference voting.  Putnam also correlates these &quot;objective&quot; measures with more opinion-based survey indicators of civic culture.<br />Most of Putnam's evidence coheres quite well with his causal argument.  His quantitative indicators of both institutional performance and civic culture are relatively broadand accurate, with the minor exceptions that would be inherent in any attempt to quantify a complex, multi-dimensional concept like &quot;civic culture&quot;.  The strong statistical correlations identified by the measurement of his indicators, backed up with corresponding qualitative evidence (some, but not all of it historical), can probably be taken as reliable evidence of a meaningful causal relationship (in Italy) between civic culture and institutional performance.  Perhaps the most striking implication of these results is that the ubiquitous relationship between economic development and democracy is actually shown to &quot;disappear&quot; in a statistical sense.  In other words, Putnam has controlled for economic development and found that civic culture predicts both democracy and economic development, perhaps even better than economic development itself.  This finding, if confirmed in other studies and settings, would obviously topple quite a few of the canonical theories in comparative politics.broad and accurate, with the minor exceptions that would be inherent in any attempt to quantify a complex, multi-dimensional concept like &quot;civic culture&quot;.

North and Thomas seek to explain the &quot;rise of the Western world&quot; by illuminating the causal importance of an efficient economic organization that guarantees a wide latitude of property rights and both incentives and protection for economic growth.  Although they pay homage to both Marxian and neoliberal theory, they take a theoretical middle ground that privileges the sociopolitical backdrop of economic affairs (as opposed to solely private or class-based activity) and in doing so identifies the roots of modernization as far back as the 10th Century.  To justify the novelty and originality of this approach, they write that most analysts have misidentified the symptoms of modern economic growth (technological change, human capital, economies of scale) as the causes.  In doing so, previous scholars have failed to answer the question &quot;if all that is required for economic growth is investment and innovation, why have some societies missed this desirable outcome?&quot; (2).  Their answer is that some societies (England and the Netherlands) were better than others (France and Spain) at providing an efficient economic organization that could guarantee conditions favorable to per capita economic growth among a rapidly growing population.<br /> These conditions are conceptualized as mechanisms to reduce the gap between &quot;social&quot; and &quot;private&quot; rates of return, the key operating concepts in the analysis.  Indeed, any old economic undertaking can provide private gains, but the &quot;social&quot; costs or benefits of this undertaking will affect the society's well-being, and a given discrepancy between the two rates of return means that a third party will absorb benefits or costs of this undertaking (an example would be the lack of intellectual property rights for inventions, leading to copying and piracy by third parties).  A lack of strong property rights gives these third parties the institutional incentive or imperative to absorb social costs or benefits, and if private costs exceed private benefits then no rational chooser would ever undertake any risky new private economic activity (trade, inventions, investment, etc.).  In a sense, then, the analysis becomes a refreshing neoliberal justification for strong government power.<br /> Population growth serves as a convenient control variable for this analysis, because by holding population growth constant across all the countries concerned, the authors are able to pinpoint their causal variable (parity between private and social rates of return) in the cases where it spurred the rise of capitalism (England and the Netherlands).  Population growth serves as a control because the authors show that the rise of the Western World happened only after the second population boom in the period being studied (16th Century) - the fact that it didn't happen during the first population boom (10th through 13th Centuries) means that population growth alone cannot be seen as accountable for modernity.  But how did the two population booms differ from each other?  Only during the second one were England and the Netherlands able to provide per capita growth by providing a climate of incentives and protections (rule of law, property rights, insurance companies, joint stock companies, etc.) that reduced the gap between private and social returns and laid the groundwork for the industrial revolution to begin.<br /> The evidence provided to back up this causal argument comes in two primary forms:  citations of historical scholarship (often quoting large passages out of encyclopedias) that are given a &quot;new&quot; economic spin, and a great deal of quantitative evidence, in the form of graphs and charts, to verify the cycles of population growth and economic growth and recession being identified.  The authors admit that the quality of statistical data from the early period under study is rather dubious, but if one can grant the integrity of the historians that uncovered such incomplete and partial data then one can probably take this data as high-quality evidence of the trends being identified.<br /> The authors are intentionally ambiguous about their theoretical implications.  Clearly, they seek to refute Marx by showing that technological change alone could not have been the cause of capitalist development, since this change itself was a symptom of both population growth and a favorable institutional climate (what Marx would dismiss as the superstructure).  However, it's not clear how much they wish to refute neoliberal theory, since they follow much of its logic regarding the role of incentives in economic growth.  They admit that Adam Smith himself went too far in his laissez-faire beliefs, since a weak state would not be able to provide the kinds of efficient economic organization that our authors advocate.  But their analysis does not clarify just how strong of a state is required for such organization, especially in the information age economy.h incomplete and partial data then one can probably take this data as high-quality evidence of the trends being identified.<br /> The authors are intentionally ambiguous about their theoretical implications.

MacIver writes that the book's particular relevance for a political scientist is that &quot;it will help him to restate old issues and to evaluate old doctrines&quot; (xi).  However, with the recent renaissance of liberal/classical economic doctrines (what Polanyi would scornfully call the utopia of the &quot;self-adjusting market&quot;) it seems that the issues restated and the doctrines evaluated by Polanyi are not so &quot;old&quot; after all.  For this reason, the book has even more relevance now than it did for past readers, even just twenty years after its publication, when the heyday of planned economics appeared to be carrying out Polanyi's proposed remedies for the excesses of free marketism, and blunting the force of his critique as applied to post-transformation society.  But in the era of WTO and NAFTA, a strong case can be made that his critique has attained newfound relevance beyond even its original application.<br />  This critique can be phrased into a causal historical argument as follows:  The Great Depression and two World Wars are Polanyi's dependent variable (the outcome to be explained).  For Polanyi, this turmoil of 1917-1945 was a catastrophic indicator that 19th Century civilization had collapsed.  And since 19th Century civilization rested upon the &quot;classical&quot; economic liberal doctrine of a self-regulating market, (with accompanying balance-of-power system, gold standard, and laissez-faire liberal state that defended property rights above all else and viewed human labor as no more than a commodity) it is this doctrine that is Polanyi's independent, explanatory variable.  For him, the &quot;utopian&quot; and unattainable ideal of the self-regulating market was in reality a destructive force that robbed humanity of its freedom, by causing one hundred years of relative peace (the veritable calm before the storm) and then unleashing heretofore unheard of levels of economic dislocation and political repression.  The &quot;Great Transformation&quot; itself is merely the mechanism by which this causal relationship unfolded.  It is the process by which the ideal of the self-regulating market utopia brought about the destruction of the old world and the dawning of a new, more dangerous world.<br />  Polanyi's evidence for this process is both deductive and inductive.  Most of the book masquerades as a straightforward historical account of the Great Transformation and its exact social processes, but at times Polanyi reads less like an empiricist and more like a deductive rationalist.  For instance, he proposes a general covering law of historical causality whereby countries that are apparently &quot;opposed to the status quo would be quick to discover the weakness of the existing institutional order and to anticipate the creation of institutions better adapted to their interests&quot; (28).  He then gives Germany in the 1930s as an example of such a process, Germany for him being one of the &quot;catalyst&quot; states that sped up the Great Transformation by abandoning market liberalism in favor of fascism.  While the example is fascinating and has obvious historical merit, it's not clear how Polanyi arrived at the general law of which Germany is an example, not to mention whether he truly believes that such a law applies consistently throughout history, or whether he merely means to inductively show the importance of Germany's opposition to the status quo for the particular historical causal mechanism of the Great Transformation.<br />  Polanyi's work obviously runs counter to a great deal of conventional wisdom on the topic of economic and political doctrines and their relationship to social change in the 19th Century.  For instance, the 19th century is often called the &quot;age of nationalism,&quot; but Polanyi's Great Transformation, like the work of Marx, minimizes the role of the nation-state in shaping the lives of its own citizens, by arguing that state governments were merely pawns for the ideal of the self-regulating market and its stooges in power, both financial and political.  Indeed, as a remedy to the negative effects of the Great Transformation, Polanyi seems to advocate a rise in the power of the nation-state, through the active securing of freedom and rights by its citizens in opposition to the stateless self-regulating market.  One could brand Polanyi a collectivist for this reason, although he would resist such a charge precisely because of his defense of individual freedom against the market and his warnings about the dangers of erring on the other side: the potential loss of human freedom that would come from free individuals attempting to subjugate and regulate markets through government.  &quot;Regulation both extends and restricts freedom; only the balance of the freedoms lost and won is significant&quot; (254).  In other words, Polanyi is certainly not a Marxist, because of his lack of both economic determinism and any clear theory of class conflict and revolution, but neither can he be an apologist for capitalism since he seeks to shatter the myth of the self-regulating market as being a &quot;natural&quot; ideal independent of social moorings and above general social welfare.  Therefore, instead of these two extremes, he strikes a middle ground that is as paradoxically complex as it is eloquently defended., minimizes the role of the nation-state in shaping the lives of its own citizens, by arguing that state governments were merely pawns for the ideal of the self-regulating market and its stooges in power, both financial and political.

But how they got there is another matter.  At the most general level, Barrington Moore Jr.'s &quot;Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy&quot; seeks to explain differing national paths towards this modernity.  More specifically, he seeks to analyze the evolution of modern political systems through their social, economic and institutional bases.  Even more specifically, he posits a bold thesis that the particular relationship between peasants and landowners in a given country, more than any other factor, determines whether that country will eventually become democratic, communist, or fascist.  And more specifically still, Moore argues that in countries where landowners were able to secure political power independent of the crown, and become bourgeois managers of commercial agriculture in a way that created minimal political grievance among those who worked the land, then the result was capitalist democracy.  However, in countries like Russia, China, Germany and Japan where this process was halted, forced, abortive, or out of sequence, then the result was dictatorship.  In the communist cases, this dictatorship came about through a revolution from below, spurred on by disgruntled peasants against a non-commercial, non-bourgeois landowning class; while in the fascist cases the modern revolution came down from &quot;above&quot; as landowning elites used the tools of the state (preindustrial bureaucracy) to impose modernity on a politically powerless peasantry.<br />In proving his argument, Moore gives evidence in the following manner:  &quot;the inevitable analytical necessity of isolating certain manageable areas of history can lead to partial truths that are misleading and even false unless and until one subsequently puts them back into their proper context&quot; (224).  In other words, Moore recognizes that his relative historical isolation of the landowner/peasant relationship can obscure a whole range of other factors from the analysis (international relations, culture, religion, etc.).  Therefore, due to the acknowledged danger posed by such an isolation, much of his book is spent &quot;re-situating&quot; the landowner/peasant relationship back into its particular national context (through his detailed case studies) in order to &quot;control&quot; for other variables like religion and culture by showing their importance to be only secondary at best in explaining paths to modernity.  Because of this richly detailed method, one can say that Moore is quite methodologically sophisticated.  He acknowledges both the value of Marxist class analysis, and the value of Weberian consciousness analysis, without falling prey to their economic and cultural determinism - or without falling prey to determinism of any kind, for that matter:  &quot;All of this does not of course mean that some inexorable fate drove Germany toward fascism from the sixteenth century onward, that the process never could have been reversed&quot; (436).<br />Furthermore, Moore warns of the dangers of excessive methodological quantification.  His case studies are not shy about using statistics to prove their claims, but he consistently offers a healthy dose of skepticism against researchers overly reliant on numerical data (using partial truths that are misleading and false outside their context, to paraphrase his earlier quote).  Moore is also fond of the occasional counterfactual to illustrate his historical claims, as shown in one of the research questions that underpin his inquiry:  &quot;is this activity necessary to the society?  What would happen if it stopped or changed?&quot; (471).  For instance, he asserts that America's &quot;capitalist revolution&quot; (the Civil War) could not have happened if northern industrialists had not been able to build a political coalition with western farmers, against the South, by awarding them free land.  Therefore, if the western territories had not been open to settlement, then America's capitalist revolution might have been delayed or irrevocably shattered.<br />On the whole, Moore displays a broad knowledge of the existing literature in his citations, as he reviews a wide body of work on each of the cases studied.  The only glaring problem with his methodology per se is that its obvious grand historical/comparative focus makes for a lack of parsimony and exactitude.  The book is full of linguistic qualifiers (&quot;largely&quot;, &quot;partially&quot;, &quot;may have been&quot;, etc.), vague, ambiguous, semi-causal arguments like &quot;considerations such as these show the difficulty of connecting the specific terms landlord and peasant to any general notion of social classes&quot; (190), and weak theory-building statements such as &quot;the instability of French democracy during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is partly due to this fact&quot; (426) (without, of course, specifying what causes might make up the other part(s) of the explanation).  In Moore's defense, however, one would have to admit that a grand comparative work such as his cannot bother to empirically sketch out the causal relationship at work in each and every local, regional and historical micro-case.<br />A further strong point of Moore's work is its predictive power.  While the road to modernity has ended for the countries in question, there are still countries today that are dealing with the same kinds of landlord/peasant issues as they attempt to commercialize agriculture in line with economic globalization.  Furthermore, the political lessons of the book can even shape our future understanding of his six cases themselves, as they evolve beyond modernity.  For instance, Moore prophetically (for 1966) states that &quot;contemporary Chinese society, despite severe difficulties and setbacks, shows signs of moving ahead.  By learning from Soviet mistakes, China could conceivably surpass Russia&quot; (230).  And now they have.  While Moore's theory would not have predicted China's post-Soviet success with any statistical exactitude, it is a measure of Moore's perceptiveness as a historically grounded comparativist that he could even arrive at such a speculation.farmers, against the South, by awarding them free land.

Into this predictably populist rant,  however, Geyer throws in a scaremongering attack on immigration, blaming  all these darn foreigners in our midst for sending America down the road to  civic ruin.  Here's just one comical example of her dark forecasts of a  future America overrun by dark peoples:<br />&quot;The borders, while not  'open,' will be effectively porous because Americans will have lost even  any spirit to make choices or protect what they have built and fought for.  Everyone will vote, even noncitizens or visitors from abroad, and so the  vote will mean nothing; every 'civic duty' will get more and more dumbed  down, and corruption will of course flourish in such a mood of ultimate  permissiveness . . . most important for bringing the international mafias  more deeply into American society.&quot; (p. 330)<br />Whoah!  Look out  everybody.  Soon, the vote will mean nothing, and there will be something  called &quot;corruption&quot; in America!  Oh no!  Well, we already knew  all that, but what we didn't know is that we can conveniently blame  immigrants for all this.  That's right.  All that &quot;ultimate  permisiveness&quot; is their fault!  Let's blame those who are less  fortunate than ourselves for our own problems.  After all, its clear that  they want to tear down everything that we've built and fought for, with  their evil &quot;mafias&quot; and all.  Let's just conveniently ignore the  fact that  immigrants originally built AND fought for this country.<br />All  of Mrs. Geyer's proto-fascist admirers reading this review should remember  that in the little closed-off, culturally conservative world that she seems  to wish for in this book, it would be very difficult for an Amazon.com, or  even an internet, to allow for the worldwide, open discussion of ideas and  works of literature.  After all, the internet was built by skilled, foreign  high-tech labor and is controlled by cultural elites and the &quot;liberal  media,&quot; right?<br />Georgie Anne Geyer, in &quot;Americans No More&quot;,  is nostalgic for an America that never was, an America where white,  English-speaking children wear perpetual smiles, always salute the flag and  never openly question the foundations of political power.  In a bit of  amateur political science, Geyer laughably compares the United States to  Yugoslavia, ignoring five hundred years of Ottoman history, fifty years of  communism, ten years of manipulation by nationalists, and the complete  absence of a rule of law in the former Yugoslavia.  As if ethnic  differences alone somehow guarantee conflict.  As if there is no way for  people of more than one color or nation to live peacefully under a single  flag, no matter what the conditions (Apparently, she's never been to  Switzerland).  Geyer writes of seeing:<br />&quot;every major multinational  and multiethnic country on the verge of disintegration.  The countries of  one people and one heritage were infinitely more secure and seemed almost  totally exempt from this syndrome.&quot; (p. 27).<br />But wait a minute,  can't a country be multiethnic without being multinational?  Hasn't that  always been thefundamental strength, and even the advantage, of the United  States?  Well, apparently not if Mrs. Geyer had her way.  Luckily for us,  however, her ethnically pure America could never be enforced in a truly  free society.  So let's make sure that it stays free, by rejecting her  irresponsible scapegoating of immigration for the very real problems of  political apathy and social disintegration.n the fundamental strength, and even the advantage, of the United  States?

As a political scientist, I cherish  Weber solely for his definition of the state as having a &quot;monopoly of  legitimate coercion&quot;.  Having brilliant insights like this on a  regular basis, however, apparently drove Weber further and further from  sanity over the course of his life.  The tragedy for Weber . . . well, he  had many of them.  He spent most of his life in the rubber room, and he  didn't have a particularly happy marriage, based on the biography written  by his wife Marianne.  These Germans are not party animals, you know.  They  need to go to Club Med in the winter.  These are the first examples of  seasonal-affective disease; before they had those lamps.  Don't laugh!  I  have one!  I can't make it through the day without my lamp.  If Weber were  Marx, which he wasn't, although he really dug nudism.  He liked all these  young people doing it, including D.H. Lawrence and his German wife.  He  thought that was really swell.  Anyway, buy this book . . . unless you  value your sanity, your religion, and the very social fabric of your nation  itself.	2000-08-10

Its author, Herbert Marcuse, was a walking encyclopedia, and  probably the most accessible, directly political member of the infamous  Frankfurt School.  Unlike his brilliant (if personally troubled) colleague  Theodor Adorno, Marcuse thankfully does not waste time criticizing things  like jazz music and Betty Boop (although he does admit to not seeing any  emancipatory possibilities in rock and roll).<br />Moreover, when the  Frankfurt school members once toured St. Louis, Marcuse had nothing but  scorn for the famous &quot;Arch&quot; of St. Louis, while his younger  colleague Jurgen Habermas wanted to go all the way to the top (this  obviously reflects different generational sensibilities among German  intellectuals).  Our good friend Marcuse was also known to wear flannels,  smoke cigars, and drink good scotch, all of which he did in a 1960s visit  to that hotbed of radical dissent (and my alma mater) Antioch College.<br />While his masterpiece, &quot;One-Dimensional man&quot;, is a brilliant  synthesis of Marx and Freud that leaves no doubt that we live in a  seriously deficient society, it also does not leave much hope for the  possibility of any one person or group effecting constructive change.  In  fact, the only really hopeful note in &quot;One-Dimensional Man&quot; is  the fact that the book, like all of Marcuse's other books, is dedicated to  his wife Inge, &quot;again and again&quot;, which shows that true love can  flourish even among the deadening cynicism inevitably brought about by full  exposure to the omnipresent conformity of one-dimensional society.	2000-08-10

After all, as Central  Asia and the Caucuses continue heating up into the new trendy geopolitical  flashpoint: a raging battleground of Islam, ideology, oil, blood, and  ethnicity, the world's policymakers are increasingly scratching their  heads.  Should we be worried about the ongoing Russian influence in the  area?  Should we fear the new rise of political Islam among the ex-Soviet  Khanates?  What is the best way to encourage the rise of liberal democracy,  rule of law, and respect for human rights in the new states of Central  Asia?<br />For the astute reader, Hopkirk answers all of these contemporary  questions in his history of The Great Game.  Far from being a simple  narrative of the 19th-Century struggle between Britain and Czarist Russia  for influence in the Near East, this book is nothing short of a political  blueprint for all modern statesmen who would seek influence in Asian lands.  If Hopkirk had been Russian, perhaps his writing would have dissuaded a  few generals from launching their disastrous invasions of Afghanistan and  Chechnya.<br />Indeed, Hopkirk foretold it all, and, like Robert Kaplan  writing about Yugoslavia, the world probably has yet to see the full extent  of his prophecy.  If you are interested in the means by which ambitious  empires have attempted to influence the most &quot;unruly&quot; and  rebellious of their subjects, then &quot;The Great Game,&quot; with its  tales of gentlemen-adventurers posing as pilgrims or traders to gain  information for their kings (and being sold into slavery or beheaded if  they failed in their quests) is most definitely of interest.<br />Hopkirk's  only literary shortcoming is an excessively dry style that is rather light  in amusing anecdotes, which may have lent the book a more human touch.  Also, he could have been a bit more explicit about the present-day  political implications of his book -- that's right -- the ones I've just  been raving about!  But otherwise, the book fully deserves the four stars  that I've given it.ld have been a bit more explicit about the present-day  political implications of his book -- that's right -- the ones I've just  been raving about!

Most [reviewers] seem to be more interested in<br />ranting about the evils of communism and equating it with Nazism than<br />they are in providing potential readers with an objective look at the<br />quality of historical research and exposition in the book at hand.<br />This glaring loss of focus can probably be forgiven, however, because<br />the rapid historical onset of Marxism forced most of the world to<br />choose sides, and we are still recovering from this polarized climate.<br />However, with the worldwide triumph of liberal democracy over planning<br />and purges, it would seem to me that the McCarthyist gloaters could<br />keep it down a bit.  They seem to take this book as their bible, but<br />how many of the Black Book's fans have questioned why two of its<br />editors later renounced the book and their role in it?  This little<br />fact is ignored by most of our reviewers, but caused quite a stir in<br />the French press when it was announced.  Could it be that chief editor<br />Courtois went just a little to far in his vehement archival slandering<br />of communism?  While this book is by far the best-researched history<br />of communism ever attempted, it makes no attempt to hide its one-sided<br />approach.  No significant mention is made by Courtois of the numerous<br />atrocities commited by the worldwide forces of anti-communism, whether<br />in the form of purges, persecution or proxy war, and their role in<br />making communism more a more violent animal as a defensive reaction.<br />This is a shameful omission.  But, like many great histories, the book<br />manages to rise above its own biases to enthrall the reader and hold<br />fast his attention.  The chapters on Afghanistan and Africa will be<br />the most interesting to well-versed readers, as they explore more<br />obscure areas of communist history.  In short, the book is a must-read<br />for any student of politics, casual or otherwise, but the disturbing<br />bias of a few of the Black Book's editors must be kept in mind while<br />reading the book's mind-numbing catalog of atrocities, or else all<br />neutral perspective will be lost.or otherwise, but the disturbing bias of a few of the Black Book's editors must be kept in mind while reading the book's mind-numbing catalog of atrocities, or else all neutral perspective will be lost.	2000-06-15

Few  writers have described this environment better than Hanif Kureishi.  The  Buddha of Suburbia is his best book, and the BBC adaptation starring Naveen  Andrews (of the English Patient) as Karim doesn't come close to doing it  justice.  Although The Buddha suffers from a certain shallowness of  character, which is bound to happen whenever an author puts culture and  setting ahead of individual, this flaw is offset by the brilliance with  which Kureishi navigates the various identity crises in Karim's life that  mirror those of Britain as a society.  It is sheer genius to cast the  postmodern soul of Britain as an Anglo-Pakistani youth.  No character  better illustrates the up-for-grabs nature of this changing society, and  the supporting characters like Charlie, Changez and The Buddha (Dad), while  degenerating into shallow caricatures of real people at times, are  thrilling examples of decadence and personal struggle that will hold any  reader's attention.  Altough Kureishi's favored medium is the screenplay  (Beautiful Laundrette, Sammy and Rosie, etc.) The Buddha of Suburbia should  be given &quot;classic&quot; status as a near-perfect example of the  &quot;multicultural novel,&quot; mainly because it dives deep into identity  politics without becoming a one-dimensional PC sermon.	2000-04-02

Obviously, no layman author is going to  have much verifiable inside dirt on the &quot;katsas&quot; and their  intelligence coups, especially an amateur such as Thomas who has no  particular expertise in Israeli affairs and is better known as a journeyman  author on a wide range of non-fiction subjects.  So, if you're looking for  some kind of exhaustively researched bible of Mossad history, then I'm  afraid this is the wrong book for you.  Thomas is more interested in luring  the casual reader's interest with shocking allegations, like the Princess  Diana/Mossad connection, than he is in providing some kind of chronological  encyclopedia of the Mossad's deeds, as several of the other reviewers have  made us aware in just a bit too much detail.  Well, sorry guys, we're all  very impressed with your stinging criticisms about the proper date of the  Entebbe rescue and the book's lack of footnotes, but they ring a little  hollow considering that &quot;Gideon's Spies&quot; is a blatant piece of  entertainment non-fiction and nothing more.  I'm sure that Thomas himself  would be the first to admit this.  I've read other books on the Mossad,  such as &quot;Inside Stories&quot; by Eisenberg, and I have to say that  Thomas' book is just as well-researched as any of the others, if a bit  meandering at times, and is quite excellent if you're in the market for a  casual and entertaining look at the world's most fearsome spy agency.	2000-03-23

Diamond draws upon a  wealth of expertise in fields as diverse as botany, zoology, archaeology  and anthropology to produce a non-racist, environmental explanation for why  European peoples came to dominate the globe.  You may have to read it in  order to believe it.  As the simplicity and obviousness of Diamond's  multi-layered argument unfolds, it has the reader repeatedly slapping his  hand on his forehead and saying &quot;duh&quot;.  You wonder why, for so  many years, so many of us have subconsciously entertained simplistic,  culturally-based explanations of the &quot;backwardness&quot; of the  world's colonized peoples.  Now we know the true story, and we owe a big  vote of thanks to Jared Diamond for writing it.  Even if his detailed  explanations are a bit long-winded and repetitive at times, he makes up for  this shortcoming with just enough amusing anectodes about the ironies  inherent in the &quot;fates of human societies&quot; to make this book an  expansive and delicious read.	2000-03-15

This apparent flaw is also a  strength, however, as it allows Goodwin the space to show off his main  talent as a writer: namely, delivering amusing anectodes about relatively  obscure events in a breezily British style marked with large doses of wit  and irony.  This reliance on anectodes means, of course, that &quot;Lords  of the Horizons&quot; can never be a bible for the serious Ottoman scholar,  but it is perfect for the armchair historian, potential visitor to Turkey,  or for one who simply enjoys exploring the quirks of history and human  societies, and reflecting on these in an irreverently cosmopolitan way.	2000-03-10

Along with Gabe Almond and a few other luminaries, Lipset blazed a trail and managed to put the &quot;science&quot; in  political science at a time when most of his colleagues were writing  one-dimensional country studies and other subjective hoo-ha.  &quot;Political Man&quot; is first and foremost a work of political  sociology, in the tradition of Weber, Marx and Parsons, and as such seeks  to uncover the social factors underlying political variables like  legitimacy and stability.  Since Lipset's work is dated in several ways,  including an obsolete cold-war division of world comparative categories, as  well as a positivistic, naive modernist belief in the objectivity of social  sciences, the book's shine has been somewhat dimmed over time.  However,  the meticulousness and parsimony of Lipset's research, coupled with the  stunningly coherent writing style, make the book a mouth-watering treat  nonetheless.  Political scientists of today should read the book more for  form than content, as it is a true masterpiece of rigorous objectivity and  of social scientific analysis in general.	2000-03-09

Ahmad weaves together a collection of postmodern,  identity-laced stories that skip back and forth between past and present,  India and Canada, dealing with traditional cultural themes as well as more  adventuresome stuff like drugs, sex, student riots and going hunting for  tigers.

Thompson wannabe-gonzo bragging, it soon settles into a much more  sophisticated groove, bolstered by Cox's significant grasp of Burmese  history, Southeast Asian politics, and obligatory willingness to mix with  the locals, dabble in a few vices, and refreshingly steer clear of  &quot;ugly American&quot; stereotypes and boorish behavior abroad.  The meandering of the book, between wandering  Thailand's red-light  district, sharing the quest of obsessed American POW hunters, and a good  deal of astute political analysis, can lose the reader a bit at times, but  by the last hundred pages one is fully engrossed, engaged, and rooting for  Khun Sa and his ragtag band of drug-financed outlaw good guy rebels, while  booing and hissing the bureaucratic US officials who forego supporting the  Shan, valiant enemies of the odious Burmese regime, because of our  hypocritical and shortsighted &quot;war&quot; on drugs.  Sadly, since  Cox published this ambitious work, Khun Sa has given up his guns and his  poppy fields, betrayed by his own Shan rebels beause of his half-Chinese  ancestry and perceived greed, and the old man is now doing lucrative  hotel/casino business deals with the Rangoon regime.  Oh well, at least Cox  got in one hell of a narrative description before this &quot;drug  lord&quot; decided to call it quits.  Anyway, the relevance of the Golden  Triangle to the international smack trade is now fading away, as the Afghan  Taliban find that they can endure their diplomatic isolation quite nicely,  thank you, by flooding world heroin markets in the name of political Islam.	2000-02-18

The criticism session was a highly entertaining exercise in  scholarly colleague-bashing, because Said (rather blatantly) had the gloves  off, and not only trashed Huntington's work but also articulated a scathing  critique of the entire beltway, foreign affairs, Washington-insider  academic elite (of which Huntington is an eminent member) for its American  paternalism, alarmism and triumphalism.  While Huntington's thesis is  hardly of a  triumphalist nature, of course, it is indeed alarmist,  painting a world-scale portrait of Western Civilization in decline and  under attack on all fronts.  But this is not the main flaw of Huntington's  detailed and meticulously researched work (in which, it must be admitted,  there are few serious flaws).  Instead, the biggest criticism that can be  made of this book is the overly simplistic (almost childishly so) nature of  the &quot;Clash&quot; hypothesis (which Said never tired of caricaturing in  mocking tones).  Huntington is basically saying that &quot;different&quot;  people cannot get along, that they will usually prefer their own  &quot;kind&quot;, and will probably always be in conflict of one sort or  another.  Duh.  One would like to think that such cynical neo-realism would  be confined to computer games such as &quot;civilization&quot; (an  immensely entertaining means of wasting an entire evening, by the way) but  apparently not.  Of course, Huntington's argument is more nuanced and  deep than that unjust reduction makes it out to be, but that is, I'm afraid  to say, the main thrust of his book.  Unfortunately, when seeing Said speak  I hadn't yet read Huntington's book, so of course I laughed at the  ridiculousness of the Clash thesis as portrayed by Said.  Now I have  read the book, however, and other than limited alarmism and  over-simplification, I can safely say that Huntington's work is an  impressively-researched piece of social scientific brilliance.  As  Huntington himself admits in his introduction, the Clash is of course an  over-simplified conceptual model, but then, what conceptual models aren't  over-simplified to some degree?  Marxism, anyone?  Huntington's thesis is  parsimonious and intensely provocative, and that is exactly what the field  of international relations needs at this time of widespread theoretical  poverty.e book, however, and other than limited alarmism and  over-simplification, I can safely say that Huntington's work is an  impressively-researched piece of social scientific brilliance.

His theses on the third world  and its future (the basic topic of &quot;Ends of the Earth&quot;) are  ground-breaking, original, and probably a little bit too sensationalistic  and over-hyped.  Nevertheless, it's eye-opening stuff that takes you way  beyond the news headlines and guidebooks.	1999-12-02
US	50835042	R20ZH60HHUO9F1	0375404120	939433309	Glamorama	Books	4	5	7	N	N	laughably frightening	Never has Euro-American elite cultural fashion been parodied so lovingly and viciously as in &quot;Glamorama,&quot; where Ellis renders celebrity, glamhood, and modelhood into a shimmering super-world of symbolism and  semiotics where every interaction between Victor (the male model  protagonist) and his urban elite friends and enemies speaks volumes about  our late 20th century minds that are inseparable from the voluminous media  they devour hourly.  Unfortunately, however, the book becomes laughable  in its second half as it attempts to depict fashion models as anti-Zionist  terrorists working to influence American elections by blowing up Parisian  cafes.  Ok, sure, it's a cool idea.  I'm not trying to be some kind of  zealous nerd here.  But it comes off as absolutely laughable, and Ellis  betrays his total ignorance of world politics several times a page.  You  may think that this shortcoming is irrelevant to the book's goal, but it  sure makes it damn hard to take seriously.	1999-11-25

The chapter on North Korea is particularly amusing, owing as much to the country's off-limits  status as to the bizarre and Stalinistically Disneyland-like nature of the  place.  And, of course, I am glad that Mr. Pelton chose to include the  United States.  Maybe that will wake up all of those American ostriches who  vote isolationist and fail to realize that they live in the most dangerous  country in the world -- where you can be killed for reasons much less  compelling and legitimate than your tribe, your politics, or the previous  sins of your ethnic group or religion.	1999-11-25
