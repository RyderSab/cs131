In Open And Shut, Rosenfelt's debut novel, he introduces Andy Carpenter, a wise-cracking suburban New Jersey defense attorney that I hope to see around for quite awhile. As a result of my enjoyment of this attention-grabbing, fast-paced legal thriller/mystery and Rosenfelt's nail-bitng writing style, I've ordered the other three books in this series. If you've enjoyed Harlan Coben's books, particularly his series featuring Myron Bolitar, I think you'll find many of the same positive characteristics in Open And Shut. Without wanting to tell too much of the plot of this exciting story, Open And Shut involves Andy Carpenter seeking a new trial for a man who, after being suceesfully prosecuted for murder by Andy's father seven years earlier, is on death row with time running out. The only reason for my not giving this book a five-star rating is that Rosenfelt does not give closure to a few of the sub-plots; however, I assume these \\"loose threads will be tied tighter\\" in his subsequent books in the series. I highly recommend Open And Shut to you.	2005-09-19

In Fade, Mills delivers a thriller that holds your attention from first page to last. His main characters are well-developed and not the run-of-the mill action figures, particularly Salem al-Fayed. What keeps this book from getting a 5-star rating is that while the plot is filled with action, much of it is predictable. Further, several of the secondary characters are one-dimensional and stereotpical. While Fade didn't live up to the high expectations I had for it based on its very exciting first half of the book, it is still worth reading and a notch above many of the other recent books in this genre.	2005-09-15

Norman Green is a very good writer and reminds me of Richard Price. In The Angel of Montague Street Greens tells the story of Silvana Iurata, who returns to Brooklyn after many years to find out what happened to his missing brother. He is well aware of the danger of his return, as his mob-connected cousin, who has held a grudge against Silvana from when they were teenagers, is planning to find and kill him. Green is a real pro in developing very \\"real\\", three-dimensional characters and in capturing the language and nuances of those from the seedier side of Brooklyn in the 1970's. If you enjoy books that are driven more by character development that plot, this is definitely a book I think you'll enjoy. If plot development and action-oriented thrillers, however, are your thing, then maybe you would be better off with a different book. While the plot is interesting and holds your attention, it moves at a pretty slow pace. So be prepared if you decide to take on this book. Having read and enjoyed The Angel of Montague Street, Green's second book, I bought his two other books.	2005-09-03

After reading the favorable reviews on Amazon and the book's interesting jacket cover, as well as being a big fan of WWII thrillers in general, I couldn't wait to start Double Cross Blind. However, after plodding through almost half of this book, I had to give up on it. I found the author's style of wriitng to be pedestrian, his dialog to be unreralistic and his main and minor characters to be thiny developed and basically unlikable. I could have accepted these limitations if the story line was captivating, which was not the case. As a result, I felt that I was the victim of a double cross blind. I hope you don't make the same mistake I made by plunking your money down for this book that seems like it has all the makings of a non-stop, thrilling reading experience. Perhaps if I was able to make it through the second half of the book, it would have made up for all the faults I had with it in the first half -- but I felt there was about as much chance of this happening as seeing snow in August.	2005-08-28

In Veritas, Lashner's second novel featuring Victor Carl and company, he proves that Hostile Witness, was no fluke. Lashner's characters are multidimensional and memorable. His plot is well-developed with interesting sub-plots and his narrative style keeps the flow of the book moving along at a nice pace. Veritas is well-worth reading but it is not without some flaws. Lashner uses so many characters that it is hard at times to keep track of who's who to whom without a scorecard, so to speak. Further, it took a bit too long to tie together the complex main plot and sub-plots, and some of the decriptive passages went on too long. A little more editing would have made Veritas even more enjoyable for me. Nonetheless, Lashner is one of the better writers in his genre today and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of his books.	2005-08-22

I loved Miller's first book, The Last Family, and was very pleased to learn that after many years of waiting he wrote a new thriller called Upside Down. I bought an ARC of this book, which also included a second new thriller by him called Inside Out. Unfortunately, the high expectations I had for Upside Down were far from met; and my disappointment was so strong that I'm not sure if I'll read Inside Out. While Miller provides an abundance of action throughout the book, the dialogue he provides is so poorly written and his characters are so thinly developed and shallow that I found myself not caring enough about what was to happen next. The main area of suspense for me was to see if I could win the struggle to finish this disappointing book. While I won this \\"battle\\", I probably lost the \\"war,\\" as my confidence in an author for whom I had high hopes may be gone for good. Do yourself a favor and skip this book; but if you come across a copy of The Last Family, definitely read it.	2005-08-11

From the time that Billy Wiles finds (on page 14) an anonymous note on his windshield his life is turned upside down. You, as the reader, will also find your normal life put on hold, as you won't be able to put this book down. With Velocity, Koontz returns to the top echelon of thriller writers. Velocity provides not only a fast-paced, nail-biting, suspenseful storyline, it contains characters that are very well-developed and multi-dimensional. The main character, Billy Wiles, who on the surface seems like an ordinary, hardworking guy, is one that you'll remember for a long time. I've enjoyed many of Koontz's books over the years and Velocity ranks very near the top -- second only to Watchers, Intensity and Dark Rivers Of The Heart. Velocity is definitely worth reading but --beacause of its slightly disappointing ending -- is not worthy of a 5-star rating. My feeling is similar to one of the other reviewers who felt that because the plot was so strong, no ending would have been satisfying enough.	2005-07-27

After reading Flynn's first two books, Term Limits and Transfer Of Power, I was looking forward to another tale of non-stop action and thrills. Much to my surprise, however, The Third Option,was a big disappointment. The plot was too dragged out and the action was neither very exciting nor frequent enough. Further, the biggest letdown in this book pertained to it's conclusion -- or lack thereof. The Third Option ends leaving the reader \\"hanging.\\" Flynn is an author that I felt I could count on for edge-of-your-seat suspense and a very satisfying reading experience. Unfortunately, Flynn let me down big-time in his third effort featuring Mitch Rapp. I'm hoping that this book was just a fluke and that the others in the series will live up to the high expectations I have when I pick up a Vince Flynn book.	2005-07-21

If you're a Jeffery Deaver fan, I think you'll agree that The Twelfth Card is a good, entertaining mystery -- just not up to par with other books in the series. While the story maintained my interest from beginning to end and the plot (which is described in detail in some other reviews) had several twists and turns, I felt that this book didn't have me glued to the edge of my seat -- as I've come to expect to be from Deaver. Perhaps this is due to the series becoming somewhat formulaic, and so I've become used to things not being what they seem. Or perhaps the book was just a good read but not an excellent one; which, again, is what I've become used to from Deaver. The basic plot starts off very strong and continues that way until about the last third of the book. At this point, Deaver becomes a bit too gimmicky with his 'surprises', which, while I didn't guess most of them, weren't super exciting or plausible. Despite these criticisms, The Twelfth Card is worth reading and one that I think will help make a visit to the beach or a plane ride a more enjoyable experience.	2005-07-10

I've enjoyed many of Christopher Hyde's books and so I  bought his latest, An American Spy, on the strength of his reputation alone. However, much to my disappointment, An American Spy could not maintain my interest. The plot took much too long to develop, the main characters were not very interesting, the dialogue was a bit unrealistic and the thrills did not come fast enough and were somewhat tepid. The only enjoyable aspect of the book for me pertained to Hyde's description of England during WWII, which served as the backdrop for the story involving the murder of an American officer and unsettling implications of treason by a band of U,S. soldiers. As a result, I soon developed a 'who cares' attitude and ultimately gave up on the book about two-thirds of the way into it. If you are interested in historical fiction I'd recommend Chritopher Hyde's The Second Assasin and Wisdom Of The Bones.	2005-06-25

Mafia Summer is a memorable story that takes hold of your gut and doesn't let go until the very end. It primarily is a tale of the friendship between two unlikely teens -- a tough Sicilian head of a street gang, the other a sickly, brilliant Jewish boy -- that are caught in the turmoil between the various Mafia families that ruled NY during the hot, steamy summer in the section of NYC called Hell's Kitchen in 1950. Vincent writes in such a way that I felt I was right there with all of the well-developed and interesting characters experiencing the strong firendships, loyalties, betrayals and full-scale crime war that took place on the rough streets of NY. Mafia Summer, E. Duke Vincent's first book, is one of the better fictional books about the Mafia that I've read in many years. While it's not on the level of the classic, The Godfather, it's not very far below -- which, to me, is very high praise. Mafia Summer is much more than an excellent book about the Mob. It's an excellent book -- period!. Enjoy!	2005-06-21

James Siegel's Detour is a very fast-paced, entertaining, enjoyable book that is perfect for the beach or your next plane. It is the type of \\"thrill a minute\\" read that will make you forget about everything else going on around you. With that said, you should know that Detour is not as good as Siegel's previous excellent thriller, Derailed. I think that some reviewers couldn't assess Detour without directly comparing it to Derailed, which accounts for some of the lower ratings it's received. Hopefully, this won't prevent you from reading Detour. Without going into detail, the plot pertains to a mother's love, a father's devotion and an adopted daughter who turns their lives upside down. Does some of what happens strain the limits of belief? Does some of how the parents respond to their situation seem at times far-fetched? Maybe so. But this is fiction and a thriller! Enjoy Detour for what it is intended to be  -- pure fun and excitement. I hope this review is helpful.	2005-06-08

With The Inside Ring, Michael Lawson has quickly established himself as an author to be reckoned with. This book is heavily plot-driven and involves a bold assassination attempt on the President of the U.S. and the private investigation into the incident. This book is filled with action and suspense and will keep you glued to your seat, especially during the last 100 pages or so. The main character, Joe DeMarco, is a lawyer on the staff of the Speaker of the House who is put in charge of the investigation. DeMarco is a likable and interesting character despite a sordid family past and will, undoubtedly, be featured in future books by Lawson. The other characters are not particularly well-developed but are still interesting. The fast pace of this book, however, will likely allow you to (mostly) overlook this shortcoming. While not everything that happens 'rings true', Lawson writing style is very entertaining and easy to follow. The Inside Ring is highly recommended for your next beach-read or plane trip.	2005-05-31

However, due to the very mixed reviews Hidden Prey received I put off reading it until about a week ago. Bottom line is I should have avoided this book -- at best, it's mediocre. The plot (which is described in detail in other reviews) started off interesting but became much too drawn out and, ultimately, somewhat boring. Further, the character of Lucas Davenport is much more subdued in Hidden Prey than other Prey books, making him less appealing, and the \\"bad guys\\" (grandpa and grandson) are not very well developed and lack credibility. While Sandford let me down in Hidden Prey, he still remains one on my top tier authors and I plan to read his latest, Broken Prey, soon.	2005-05-27

While The Footprints Of God is a fairly good book, it does not measure up to Iles' past perfomances. In typical Iles fashion, the book is well-written. However, the plot, while ambitious in scope, is too convoluted and takes too long too develop. I found myself losing interest in many passages and began to skim through these sections. Further, the characters in The Footprint Of God are not nearly as well-developed as in most of Iles' other books and are somewhat unbelievable. This book might have been more enjoyable had it been about 100 pages shorter. Iles has definitely redeemed himself in his latest book, Blood Memory, which I highly recommend.	2005-05-19

As the former head of a major advertising agency, he mastered the art of developing advertising to help successfully brand his clent's products and he hit upon a strategy that carried this art into his fiction writing. The formula he uses in his books has enabled him to become an industry unto himself. However, with his last several books, and particularly in Honeymoon, he's turned his industry into the mass production of shlock. I decided to buy Honeymoon because of the book's co-author, Howard Roughan, whose two books (The Up And Comer and The Promise Of A Lie) are excellent. Unfortunately, in this joint effort, Roughan sunk to Patterson's level in terms of quality, rather Patterson rising to Roughan's.  Honeymoon's strength is that it holds your interest and is a very fast read. If that is enough for you, then you'll probably enjoy Honeymoon. It is not a terrible book. It's just one that is very shallow in terms of plot and character development, and very predictable. Reading Honeymoon is like chewing a piece of bubble gum. It satisfies a very basic craving for a brief period, and then is totally forgettable once you are finished with it. There are so many better books than Honeymoon in this genre that my strong recommendation is to not waste your time and money on this Patterson-Roughan effort. As mentioned, if you like Patterson's style of writing, I think you'll derive a lot more pleasure from reading the two stand-alone books by Howard Roughan. As for me, I think Honeymoon has finally cured me of my habit of buying any more books by \\"Crank-em-out\\" Patterson.	2005-05-15

I've been a big fan of all of William Diehl's books, and particularly Primal Fear. And, I thought Eureka was going to be right up there among his best after reading the first third or so of this noirish mystery. However, the remainder of the book's plot, while providing a lot of action, was somewhat predictable and unrealistic. Similarly, the main characters while likable,  became too superhero-ish and the bad guys were \\"cartoonish\\" in terms of their development. So, all in all, although Eureka moves along at a fairly brisk pace and is not a bad book, it falls way short of fulfilling the high expectations I have for a book from William Diehl in general, and specifically because Eureka started out as a \\"real winner.\\"	2005-05-08

For the fourth consecutive novel, Coben relies on his proven formula in which the main character's happy life is upended by some event that the reader can relate to. This formula is one that, for the most part, works big time. The plot devices used in The Innocent, while similar to those in each of his books since Tell No One, are suspenseful, full of twists and turns and will keep the pages flying through your finger tips. The characters are interesting and well-developed, although they require you to suspend belief perhaps a bit too much. Another minor criticism - and I stress MINOR--is that as a result of The Innocent following the same basic formula of Coben's previous three books, it lacks some of the originality I earlier had come to expect from this very talented author.  Nonetheless, The Innocent is well-worth reading, very engrossing and will keep you on the edge of your seat until the last page. Fasten your seat belts!	2005-05-04

While not quite as good as Paranoia, Finder's latest is another of his thrillers that you'll find hard to put down. Without going into a lot of detail, Company Man is about Nick Conover, CEO of a leading office furniture manufacturer, who is facing major problems at work and even bigger threats to his personal life. In typical Finder fashion, he weaves a plot of non-stop suspense and develops characters that are credible and interesting, but not without flaws. The only reason I haven't given Company Man a five star rating is that I felt the ending was somewhat predictable. Nonetheless, Finder's latest thriller is well worth the investment, both in time and money. Enjoy!	2005-04-23

There is never a risk invloved with reading a Daniel Silva book -- the only unknown is will it be a very good book or an excellent book! In Prince Of Fire Gabriel Allon, art restorer and spy, is brought back from Venice to Israel after his cover is blown and his secret history falls into terrorist hands. In delivering a very well told story, rich in suspense, filled with multidimensional characters and ladened with history about the Israeli-Palistinian conflict, Silva continually rises toward  the very top echelon of thriller writers. It is a book that will keep you engrossed from start to finish. With that said, Prince Of Fire, to me, was not quite as good as Silva's past three books nor his first book, The Unlikely Spy. And while Gabriel Allon is a fictional character that is about as \\"real\\" and interesting as any that has appeared in many years, I would like to see Silva move on to a different character and story line -- at least for one or two books. Having now read all four of Silva's books with Allon, they have become somewhat formulaic. I'm ready for something new and different. I know whatever book Silva writes will be gold!	2005-04-08

With his seventh book, Blood Memory, Iles continues to enhance his reputation as a writer of intellgent, compelling, suspenseful thrillers that keep you riveted to the page. While all of his books are well-worth reading, Blood Memory ranks at the top of the list, along with The Quiet Game and Mortal Fear. Without giving away the plot details, Blood Memory is an engrossing, gripping story of childhood sexual abuse and the phychological concept of repressed memory. What makes this book (as well as his others) rise well above the pack of thrillers is not just that Iles provides an intelligent, thought-provoking story that has edge-of-your seat excitement. His even greater strengths are: (1) his ability to develop intense multi-dimensional characters that, even with their flaws, you really care about, and (2) his deep knowledge of the subject matter he is writing about combined with his ability to describe it in a style that the reader can learn from and find interesting. Be warned that the subject matter of Blood Memory is disturbing and not for the squeamish. Be assured, however, that once you start this book you'll be in the hands of a top-notch author who'll soon become one of your favorites. Enjoy!	2005-03-25

Philip Roth has long been one of our leading literary authors and, while The Plot Against America may not be his best work, it is certainly, very well-written, thought-provoking and holds your interest from beginning to end. The basic plot involves a Jewish family's concerns about life in America if, and subsequently when, Charles Lindbergh, is elected president. Roth's character development and narrative skills makes you feel that you are right there living with this family and sharing the fears and turmoil that they are experiencing. The Plot Against America is well worth reading from a literary standpoint as well as from an alternative history perspective. The only factor that keeps me from giving this book a 5-star rating is the ending, which, while satisfacory, I felt was a bit rushed and a bit abrupt.	2005-03-05

However, Lupica's execution of the plot is fairly slow-moving and predictable, and his characters are devloped with little depth. They are one-dimensional at best, making it difficult for me to care much about what happened to them.

While Grisham's latest wasn't bad enough to give up on, he has  hit an all-time low with The Broker. The plot (if you want to call the weak, loosely connected story line a plot) is poorly developed, the characters have no depth to them, and the ending (as well as most of the rest of the book) is boring. Rather than being (supposedly) a suspense thriller, The Broker reads more like an historical travelogue of Bologna, Italy and a Berlitz course on learning Italian, which is fairly interesting and the only reason I am not giving this book a 1-star rating. I've read and enjoyed to varying degrees virtually all of Grisham's books, even those that were heavily panned by many reader reviewers. However, The Broker is an almost complete waste of valuable reading time. It seems clear from the ending of The Broker that Grisham has a sequel in mind. Next time, he won't have me (and my money) to support him. Do yourself a major favor and skip this book.	2005-02-12

The Hour Game starts off with a lot of promise, interesting plot and lots of mystery and excitement. However, the book never lived up to its potential. The plot became too muddled and confusing, too many characters were involved and the interval between anything exciting happening was much too drawn out. While Baldacci's latest is just good enough to finish, it's not a book I'd recommend highly to you.	2005-02-05

Nelson DeMille has been one of my favorite authors since his first book, By The Rivers Of Babylon. With his latest effort, Night Fall, DeMille lives up to his well-deserved reputation as a \\"must read\\" author. The basic plot of Night Fall involves an investigation and an alternative conclusion to the official government decision that the crash of TWA flight 800 off the coast of Long Island, NY was something other than an accident. Demille's main character, John Corey, ex-NYPD detective and current member of the Federal Anti-Terrorist Task Force, is as irreverent and interesting as they come in fiction today. This is Demille's third, and best, book featuring John Corey; the other two being Plum Island and The Lion's Game. In many ways he reminds me of Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch character. Besides Corey, DeMille has created many other well-developed characters that help to keep the suspense and excitement moving at a brisk pace. While some other reviewers found the ending to be  contrived, I, on the other hand considered it to be quite fitting (although somewhat predictable). If you're looking for a book that is well-written, very-fast-paced, suspenseful and presents a highly interesting \\"what if\\" scenario, Night Fall is a book you shouldn't miss. As you can tell, I have a very favorable opinion of Night Fall. However, Night Fall is not among the best of the best of DeMille's books. My favorite DeMille books -- in rank order -- are Word Of Honor, Gold Coast and Charm School. Do yourself a favor and get yourself a copy of  Night Fall (as well as any of DeMille's books).	2005-01-21

Why he is not better known and does not have a larger following is even more of a mystery to me than the excellent mystery he has written in Scorched Earth. Scorched Earth is a story of crime and punishment in a small town in Virginia that is part mystery and part legal thriller. If you like Scott Turow's books you'll love Scorched Earth, as it surpasses the best of his efforts. Robbins' narrative and descriptive powers lay bare the potential of the human heart to hate and, eventually, to heal. While not a fast-moving book, Robbins has developed such strong, powerful and realistic characters that you feel every emotion each character experiences, which range the gamut from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows. In many ways, Scorched Earth reminds me of another excellent book, Mystic River by Dennis Lehane. But Robbins goes well beyond introducing you to a range of deeply moving characters, his plot will keep you guessing right until the very end -- even though you'll probably think, as I did, that you 'know who did what to who' half way through the book. I highly recommend Scorched Earth to you when you are in the mood for a very well-written, realistic, at times gut-wrenching mystery that will touch you on many levels. Be warned, though, that this is not the book to sit down with if you're in the mood for a fast-read, \\"mind candy\\" type of book. Enjoy!	2005-01-09
US	52947290	R2QGGOLVS31PWJ	0060176938	50102106	The Informant	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A Good, Fast Read!	The Informant demands your attention from the very beginning and doesn't let up until the very end. The basic plot involves the twists and turns of an FBI hunt for a serial killer, as well as of a reporter covering the case who gets anonymous phone calls from a person who claims to be able to predict the time, place and victim of the next slaying. It's an exciting, action-filled, fun book but its comparison to The Silence Of The Lambs is, in my opinion, giving it too much credit. What keeps me from giving The Informant a 5-star rating is that I found it somewhat easy to guess who the informant is and there were some pretty far-fetched coincidences that stretched my limit of credibility. Nonetheless, The Informant is well worth reading. I'm looking forward to reading other books by James Grippando. Enjoy!	2004-12-31

When I started reading The Godfather Returns I was expecting to become quickly engrossed in the adventures of the Corleone family and their associates. However, when little that was exciting occurred for much of the first half of the book, I was becoming increasingly disappointed and impatient. My disappointed then changed to considerable pleasure when I realized that this was not really intended to be an exciting book, but rather one that provides an in-depth understanding of the many characters we are so familiar with, as well as many new ones. Further, the book succeeds strongly in describing the various conspiracies and family tensions involving the Godfather. The Godfather Returns is a good supplement to those who were big fans of the book, The Godfather, and of the movies based on the book. Weingartner's provides a lot of \\"meat to the bones\\" of the already richly developed, highly memorable characters developed by Mario Puzo. I hope this review is helpful to you in deciding on whether or not to read it.	2004-12-17

The Frumious Bandersnatch is about an up-and-coming music star who is kidnapped from a rented yacht while performing at a party promoting her first album. In typical McBain fashion, his latest 87th Precinct police procedural combines an enjoyable, fast-paced plot with true-to-life characters and dialogue. Having said this, on a comparative basis, The Frumious Bandersnatch has a somewhat more predictable ending and has less action and surprises than several of McBain's previous books. Further, I found a few of the romatic sub-storylines (i.e., those involving Detctives Hawes and Ollie Weeks Hawes) to be more filler than having anything to do with the real plot of the book. If you're a fan of the 87th Precinct series I think you might feel (as I do) that The Frumious Bandersnatch is a good, fast enjoyable book but one that is a slight notch below some of the others in this series.	2004-11-29

Brimstone is a very fast-paced, suspenseful, enjoyable read, but not as good as Relic, Reliquary and The Cabinet Of Curiousities. Nonetheless, Brimstone which reunites FBI Agent Prendergast and former NYPD cop Vincent D'Agosta will grab your attention within the first few pages and not let go until the very last page. Preston and Childs have developed a unique plot in which Prendergast and D'Agosta are involved in trying to solve some murders that are devilsh in nature, or so it seems. In typical Preston/Child fashion, the authors blend science, technology, the supernatural and history in such a way that the result is a highly readble, suspenseful story. My only criticisms, albeit minor, are that the ending is too open-ended paving the way for the authors' next book), and that Prendergast, while an entertaining, memorable character is (for this reader) stretching the limits of credibility. He makes James Bond seem like an amateur. If you have a long flight or vacation coming up, Brimstone is a book that will provide pure escapism and leave you satisfied.	2004-11-21

Transfer Of Power is about a group of terrorists that have taken over the White House but avoided capturing the President due to the quick actions of the Secret Service. The President has been evacuated to his underground bunker, although almost 100 hostages have been taken. This story reads like it could (but hopefully never will) be on the front page of tomorrow's newspapers. Keep in mind, however, that Vince Flynn wrote this book almost 2 1/2 years before 9/11. From the first to the last page, Transfer Of Power kept my eyes glued to the pages and my heart beating faster than it probably should have been. While the plot has some predictable elements, some of the characters are slightly stereotypical and the ending is a bit abrupt, these are very minor flaws. This book is great fun, filled with non-stop action and perfect for when you are in the mood for pure escapism. If you enjoy books like The Last Jihad by Joel Rosenberg or Clancy-like books but without all the technical details, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of Transfer Of Power. You'll be glad you did. I have copies of all of Flynn's other books featuring Mitch Rapp, the CIA's top counterterrorism operative, and, after taking a brief respite to \\"catch my breath\\", am looking forward to going on my next terror-filled adventure with Rapp. Enjoy!	2004-11-08

I have several James Lee Burke books in my home library but White Doves at Morning was the first that I've read. Burke succeeds strongly in creating the atmosphere of the South prior to, during and after the Civil War, as well as in developing rich, multi-dimensional characters. Where the book let me down somewhat, however, was in the area of plot development. While the plot starts off interesting and holds your attention, it drags on for much too long a time. The paperback edition I read at 434 pages would have been much more exciting for me if it was 50-100 pages shorter. Nevertheless, White Doves at Morning is a good book that I think you'll like if you enjoy historical fiction about this period. Burke is a very good writer and I now plan to read his other books that I have. I just wish that this book would have a provided a more enthralling story line.	2004-10-31

It takes place in 1947 when Jackie Robinson is breaking into baseball and Parker's new hero, Burke, is hired by the Dodgers to be his bodyguard. I have not been a huge fan of Robert Parker over the years, but the basic plot of Double Play captured my interest. Having just finished it, I found it to be extremely fast reading, \\"right on\\" in capturing the mood of the period in time in which the story takes place, and exciting. While Parker's prose are sparse, his dialogue is very effective and his characters, while not developed quite enough for my taste, are very interesting. Overall, Double Play is well worth reading and can be read in one sitting if you have a few hours to devote to it. I'm looking forward to Parker's next book featuring Burke, and Double Play has made me enough of a Parker fan to now go back and read more of his books.	2004-10-23

In typical Lawrence Block style, he continues to evolve Matthew Scudder into one of the most multi-dimensional protagonists \\"alive\\" in any mystery series today. Block's writing is always strong and he continues to develop interesting supporting and secondary characters as well as subplots that hold your interest almost as much as the main character and plot. Further, his description of the sights and sounds of NYC make you feel that you are right there with Scudder experiencing them. As an intense mystery, however, Hope To Die, while entertaining and enjoyable, is not quite up to par with many of the earlier books in the series. While I was anticipating giving Hope To Die a rating between 4 and 5 stars during the first three-quarters of the book, I found the ending a bit weak and unbelievable, which caused me to lower my rating to between 3 1/2 and 4 stars. Overall, Hope To Die is a worthwhile read for those who, like myself, are familiar with the series, but is not the book I would recommend to those interested in starting this series. Despite some weaknesses in this book, the Matthew Scudder series continues to be one of my favorites and I'm looking forward to joining him on his next unofficial private investigation.	2004-10-18

John Katzenbach has been one of my favorite authors and still is, despite his mediocre performance in The Madman's Tale. Based on the basic premise of the book -- in which a murder takes place within a mental hospital -- I was expecting, in typical Katzenbach style, to be engrossed from beginning to end. However, this is far from what happened. As a result of the author's overabundance of narrative detail and excessively long descriptive passages, the pace of the book was too slow to provide the steady building of suspense and excitement I look for in a thriller. To reiterate, The Madman's Tale is not a bad book, it's just not anything special and is below the standard I've come to expect from Katzenbach.	2004-10-09

I've had The First Counsel for years but put off reading it until recently due to the many average or worse ratings it has received from Amazon reviewers. Having just finished this book, I was pleasantly surprised by its being much more deserving than the 3-star rating it, on average, has received on this web site. The First Counsel, which involves how a date with the president's daughter draws a young lawyer working in the President Counsel Office into a web of extortion, scandal and murder, will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout most of the book. Its plot is very supenseful, contains many twists and surprises. The characters are interesting and pretty well described, although at times a bit unrealistic -- particularly due to the naivete of the main character, Philip Garrick, and the over-the-top behavior of Nora, the President's daughter. Noneheless, this criticism was not a major problem for me as it appeared to be for many other reviewers of this book. To me, the action and suspense moved the story along at such a quick pace that I was easily able to overlook these flaws. Up until the last 50 pages or so I was prepared to give The First Counsel a 5-star rating. However, without going into any detail as to why, I found the ending, while not disappointing, to be not quite up to the standard of suspense and excitement Meltzer had created up to that point. If you like books in the style of James Patterson, David Baldacci and Harlan Coben, I think you will enjoy The First Counsel. I know I did.	2004-09-25

The House Of Special Purpose by Christopher Hyde is an entertaining historical thriller but it is not as good as some of this author's previous works (eg., Wisdom Of The Bones, The Second Assassin, A Gathering Of Saints, etc.). The plot involves the search by various international spies (Russia, Germany, England and the U.S.) for a film rumored to exist from the bloody days of the Bolshevik Revolution. This film could have a major impact on the balance of power in the war that is sure to involve the U.S. In typical Hyde fashion, his story is filled with real events, historical figures and true-to-life atmosphere that allowed this reader's interest to be held throughout the book. However, The House Of Special Purpose does not provide the level of sustained suspense that I found to exist in Hyde's other books. To me, Hyde made the book longer than it needed to be to be truly suspenseful in order for him to incorporate as many of the research findings as possible he uncovered about the people and events surrounding this period. It's not that these historical facts aren't interesting. They are, but at the same time they tended to detract from the excitement of the plot. As a consequence, while this book started off as if it would warrant a rating between 4-5 stars, by the time I finished it, I felt it did not deserve more than a 3 (possibly 3 1/2) star rating. Overall, The House Of Special Purpose is a good book and one that you'll probably enjoy if you like historical thrillers. It just does not live up to the high expectations I've come to expect from this author.	2004-09-14

Eric Van Lustbader wrote this book in the style of Robert Ludlum -- but unfortunately, the style Ludlum wrote in in his later years, in which he used a 'cookie cutter-like' formula. While the story moves along at a quick pace, it is very predictable. The characters are mostly one dimensional and stereotypical, the dialogue is often unrealistic and corny, and the action, while plentiful, provides no real surprises. The Bourne Legacy is good enough to finish, but not good enough start (if you haven't already gone out and bought it). The Bourne Legacy is not a bad book, it's just not a very good one.	2004-09-05

If you've read any of Avery Corman's books, you know of his strong ability to make you feel that you are right there with his characters feeling their every emotion. Well, Corman once again demonstrates this special skill in A Perfect Divorce, in which he masterfully tells a story of well-intentioned parents of a teenage son attempt to lessen the impact of their failed two-career marriage with an intelligent, successful divorce. It is a very special tale of life, love, child-rearing and divorce. At times it will make you smile with joy, feel like crying (if not actually cry) out of happiness and sadness, and, at times, break your heart due to the disappointment the divorced parents experience as well as the pain felt by the divorced child. Corman is an excellent writer and one you should not miss. All of his books are well worth reading -- the best of which are Kramer Vs. Kramer, The Old Neighborhood, 50, and Prized Possessions. Do yourself a real favor and get a copy of A Perfect Divorce. I'm confident you'll be very glad you did.	2004-09-02

Overall, The Enemy is a moderately entertaining book, but one I found myself being able to put down easily and not feel the urge to rush back to. The basic plot of a General being found dead at an unexpected site and Jack Reacher's investigation of it starts off exciting and makes for very fast reading. However, for about the next two-thirds of the book, it dragged on for very long passages of time without providing much in the way of thrills and excitement. It became overly methodolical and plodding. Jack Reacher, who is always an interesting character, continues to be so in The Enemy, but to a lesser extent than in previous books. While the ending picked up in terms of excitement and suspense, it was too little too late for me. The Enemy, if you decide to read it, is a book to take from the library or wait to buy in paperback. It is a book that I think you'll find satisfactory, but is not one that I'd recommend you put high up on your \\"to be read\\" list.	2004-08-07

I was really expecting that Garden Of Beasts was going to be one of my favorite books by Deaver yet. Based on the description of the book, I felt that its plot, involving a hit man hired to assassinate one of Hitler's top leaders during the time period of the Olympics in Nazi Berlin, contained all of the ingredients that for me make an exciting thriller. Unfortunately, this book was more of a mystery than a thriller -- with the mystery being how could Deaver write a book that had virtually no excitement for almost three-quarters of the story, and when some action did occur it was largely predictable. The characters were not particularly well-developed and several of them, including the main character, were not very credible. Further, the dialogue was a bit corny. Lastly, while I was hoping that the ending would be satisfying enough to enable me to give the book at least a 3-star rating, it was not to be. I found the ending to be very unrealistic and disappointing. If you are a big Deaver fan like I am, you might be inclined to disregard this review and plunk down your money to be able to read his latest work. If you do, I hope you won't be as disappointed as I was.	2004-07-23

Having read all the very positive reviews of The Hundredth Man, Jack Kerley's debut book, I was antipicating a thrilling, exciting reading experience. The basic premise involves what would you do to stop a killer? How many lives would you compromise to protect someone you love? These questions haunt Carson Ryder, the homicide detective protagonist, who is forced to confront not only his family's past in order to catch a killer, but also sacrifice his own future. While this premise is usually &quot;right up my alley,&quot; it turned out to be anything but that. My dislike for this book is so strong that I consider it to be one of the worst - if not the worst - book I've read in quite some time. Do yourself a major favor and avoid this way over the top, ridiculous book. Kerley's writing style is awful which quickly caused me to lose interest in the plot and his characters, many of which come off as cartoonish and unbelievable. Kerley has to learn that constantly using words in triplicate to create emotion and/or excitement(e.g.&quot;Please,please, please&quot;, &quot;Thank you, thank you, thank you&quot;, &quot;Whisk, whisk, whisk&quot;, etc.)is amateurish, boring and tedious. While in other debut books I did not like much overall, I usually felt the author showed enough potential to consider reading his next book. However, there was nothing about The Hundredth Man that makes me even remotely interested in wanting to read Kerley's next effort. It took almost all of my effort just to finish this disappointing book. I know that I am running the risk of receiving a 'not helpful' rating from you with this review (which many readers frequently give to negative reviews). If this happens, it happens, but my concern is in advising you not to make the same mistake I did in terms of time and money. If you are interested in reading a very good debut thriller and an equally good second work by an excellent, yet (at this point) little known writer named Howard Roughan, I'd highly recommend &quot;The Up And Comer&quot; and &quot;The Promise Of A Lie&quot;, respectively.recommend &quot;The Up And Comer&quot; and &quot;The Promise Of A Lie&quot;, respectively.	2004-07-23

While I enjoyed The Haunted Air (as I have most of Wilson's books), it is far from the best in the series and nowhere near as good as The Tomb. Perhaps after reading so many superlative reader reviews here, I was expecting much more than what I got. The Haunted Air is a fast-paced, entertaining book that is a good choice as a beach read or long plane trip, and Repairman Jack is - well - just Jack. Enough said about that. However, most of the other characters are thinly developed and the plot lacks the level of excitement, surprises and suspense that I've come to expect from this series, and particularly from these reviews. All in all, if you don't go into reading this book with very high expectations, as I did, and can be satisified with an entertaining story, I think you'll enjoy it.	2004-07-17

After having recently finished Roughan's second book, The Promise Of A Lie, which was very good, I went back to read his debut thriller, The Up And Comer. I enjoyed this book a great deal as well. Roughan is at the very least an \\"Up and Comer\\" in the thriller genre, and I'd say he's definitely arrived. He's joined the group of writers that I consider to be \\"must reads.\\" The Up And Comer has it all -- a captivating plot, thrills, suspense, humor, strong characters, sex, clever dialogue, etc.<br />Without giving away the plot, the story involves a lawyer who decides to take the law into his own hands to try to prevent being exposed for an affair that will threaten the existence of his near perfect lifestyle. Despite his limited sense of morality, Roughan's main character, Philip Randall, is one you can't help liking (and rooting for) even though he stands for  many things most people would say they dislike in a person. I highly recommend The Up And Comer as an excellent beach read. It's the type of book that once you start reading, you won't want to stop until you finish it. Do yourself a favor and read this book, as well as Roughan's latest, The Promise Of A Lie. If you're like me, Roughan will soon become one of your \\"must read\\" authors.	2004-06-28

In Hostile Witness, William Lashner's debut legal thriller, the author rises to the top of writers in this genre. In Victor Carl, he has create a very believable, very real and very flawed hero. What makes this book worth reading is Lashner's strength in character development. Further, the plot is also very clever and interesting --although, for me, it is stretched out somewaht longer than I felt it needed to be. At times, I found myself skimming through sections about the 'characters' in order to get back to the 'heart of the story'. As a result, unlike most reviewers who gave this book a five star rating, I'd rate it worthy of four stars -- a very good, but not outstanding rating. I think if this book was 100 or so pages less, I would have enjoyed it a lot more and probably rated it five stars. Despite this criticism, Hostile Witness is a worthwhile read. I'm looking forward to reading Lashner's other books featuring Victor Carl (Veritas, Fatal Flaw and Past Due).	2004-06-22

In A Dry Season is a very written written book with well-developed, multi-dimensional characters, and a descriptive style that makes you feel that you are right there in the small English town in which the story takes place. What it is not, however, is a mystery that has a lot of excitement, suspense and surprises; which is what I was looking for when I decided to read this book. My 3 1/2 star rating is based on the fact that the book did not deliver well enough on my in-going expectations. Nonetheless, Peter Robinson is a very good writer and I will know better about what to expect from him the next time I decide to read one of his books. And there will be a next time. If you are in the mood for a mystery that is built more on character development versus one built more on plot development than In A Dry Season is a book I think you might enjoy very much.	2004-06-03

Resurrection Day, as most books by Glenn Meade are very, fast-paced, packed with tension and excitement and filled with interesting characters. Resurrection Day was written shortly before 9-11 and is based on the President of the US  being threatened with mass destruction of Washington, DC by a bin Laden-type al-Qaeda terrorist unless he gives in to his demands. Despite its intimidating length (740 pages) and small print, Resurrection Day will keep you glued to the edge of your chair and will make you stop and think how this author was able to foresee the horrible attack in the US so accurately. The one problem you'll have is trying to obtain a copy of this book, as it doesn't seem to be available in bookstores or libraries. It is available on Amazon and other online booksellers.

While I was sorry to see that Jake Grafton has been replaced as the hero in Coonts' latest book, Liars And Thieves, the author takes you on a thrill-a-minute ride that should only be read with your seat belt on. Tommy Carmellini, the new hero (who has appeared as a minor character in Coonts' Cuba) is a smart, talented, witty, CIA agent and ex-burglar who will likely become as popular as Jake Grafton. Liars And Thieves provides enough action and excitement to leave you gasping for breath and wanting to turn the pages as fast as you can. My only criticism is that on a few occasions the plot required me to stretch my limits of credulity a bit too much. Putting this minor flaw aside, the plot, which involves Carmellini helping a beautiful ex-girlfriend who is being blackmailed and of his being asked by the CIA to investigate a massacre at a safe house that was (supposedly) protecting a former KGB archivist who defected with important secret files. is a book Coonts fans and fans of suspense thrillers in general should enjoy very much.	2004-05-20

His latest, Just One Look, is a book you won't be able to put down and will keep you in suspense from the very beginning to the very end. It is well worth reading. With that said, Just One Look, on a comparative basis, ranks a notch below two of his other stand-alones -- Tell No One and Gone For Good. While the main character, Grace, is well-developed, the more secondary characters -- and there are so many of them you need a scorecard to keep track of them -- are not particularly well-developed. Further, I had some credibility issues with some of them. The basic plot is a simple and interesting one -- a suburban housewife picks up some photos from the store, one of which is an old print depicting her husband with other people from his college days. When the wife shows the photo to her husband, he leaves home and disappears. When the wife soon learns that her husband has been kidnapped, she goes off to search for him. While this plot is suspenseful, it is not especially original, as Coben has used some of his plot devices in his other stand-alones. For example, the concept in Coben's three previous books is one in which the main character's happy life is upended by some event that the reader can easily relate to, and the use of a kidnapped family member was a key factor in Coben's last book, No Second Chance. So, I'm starting to miss some of the originality that I'd come to expect from Coben. Perhaps, he needs to take a step back and have his next book or two feature the main character, Myron Bolitor, from his excellent mystery series. As mentioned above, Just One Look has many characters that at times makes it difficult to remember who's who. However, Coben does neatly tie all the loose strings together involving these characters and who did what to who at the end. Please understand that my criticisms are not MAJOR ones and should NOT deter you from reading this book, especially if this is your first book by Coben. Coben remains one of my favorite authors and I think he'll be one of yours as well.st book by Coben. Coben remains one of my favorite authors and I think he'll be one of yours as well.	2004-04-29

Let's start with the obvious to anyone who's read a book in the Harry Bosch series. Lost Light is a very well written mystery, the main character is one of the best developed and multi-dimensional to be featured in a mystery series, and the plot is complex and keeps you guessing. However, on a comparative basis, Lost Light is more slow paced and less action-packed and suspenseful. Perhaps Bosch's now being a private eye versus a  cop has made it seem to me that he doesn't have the same toughness and &quot;edge&quot; that made him such a memorable character in earlier books in the series. It will be interesting to see what direction Connelly takes Bosch in upcoming books. If you read this book you'll see that Connelly has created several options for Bosch. I'll be anxious to travel along with Bosch (and some other characters Connelly has featured in other books) in his next adventure, The Narrows, which will be released soon.	2004-04-29

I had anticipated that The Last Juror was going to be like what I found many of Grisham's other books to be -- a suspenseful, legal thriller. The Last Juor is none of these things. It is not suspenseful and it is not thrilling. What it is, however, is one of Grisham's best books from a more literary standpoint. The Last Juror is primarily about what life in a small town in Mississippi was like during the 1970s told from the perspective of the new owner of the local newspaper, 23-year old Willie Traynor. Grisham covers important events from that time period, including religion, racism, segregation, economic concerns and the Vietnam war. Based on the description in the jacket cover about a rape/murder and the fact that the story takes place in the same town (Clanton) as his first, and excellent, book, A Time To Kill, I expected The Last Juror to be one of his better legal thrillers. Despite my not getting what I expected, I enjoyed Grisham's latest book, and found he's grown considerably in his ability to convey warmth and sentiment and to create strong, true-to-life, multi-dimensional characters. If you can overcome the fact that this is not the typical Grisham legal thriller, I think you will enjoy The Last Juror. If, however, you won't be satisfied without the usual amount of suspense, action and surprises on which Grisham has built his enormous reputation, then you should avoid this book. The Last Juror is not Grisham's best book by far, but it is worth reading. If you decide to read this book, I hope you enjoy it.	2004-04-16

While The White Road has many characters to keep track of, which at times makes the story a bit hard to follow without a scorecard (so to speak), Connolly again proves himself to be among the best of the contemporary suspense writers. Connolly is a not only a master in providing compelling plots featuring his dark, somewhat tormented hero, Charlie &quot;Bird&quot; Parker, his even stronger abilities are in developing vivid and very credible characters and in providing very graphic,compelling and emotionally-charged narratives and images. The basic plot of The White Road involves Parker going to South Carolina to help an old friend and attorney defend a young black man facing the death penalty. It's a case that nobody wants to be involved in and one deeply rooted in old evil. If you're interested in a very good, well-written story and one that will keep you glued to your seat, I'd highly recommend The White Road to you (as well as each of Connolley's other books).	2004-04-06

I have been a big fan of Larry Collins' books over the years and started off very engrossed in his latest, The Road To Armageddon, as well. However, the extreme amount of detail Collins offers on everything from money laundering to obtaining materials for use in developing nuclear devices made me feel I was reading a &quot;How To&quot; primer rather than a thriller. As a result, after forcing myself to read about half of the book, I had to give up. Life is too short and there are too many books to read to make me try to finish this book. I wouldn't be surpised that if I was able to finish the book, it would have been a good read. Most of Collins' books are. But, I guess, the ability to work your way through the overwhelming amount of detail requires much more willpower than I have. I can't say that The Road To Armageddon is a bad book, since I wasn't able to finish it. The purpose of my review is to alert you to what you are in for should you attempt to read The Road To Armageddon. Caveat emptor!	2004-03-26

One thing that can always be counted on is that Daniel Silva's thrillers will not only be exciting, they will be very intelligent, well-written, well-researched and compelling. A Death In Vienna completes the Holocaust trilogy that started with The English Assassin and was followed by The Confessor, and it is every bit as good as its predecessors. Each of these books are novels of slow-building, yet non-stop tension and suspense that will keep you glued the edge of your seat. If you haven't read a Daniel Silva book before, do yourself a favor and add this book -- and all of his books -- to your Must Read list. Money and/or time spent on a Silva book is as good as gold. You will be more than satisfied. While the subject matter of A Death In Vienna is filled with the inhumanity that occurred during the Holocaust and with contempt for those who enabled this tragedy to occur, Silva describes these events with tremendous feeling. Silva has become not only a master thriller writer, he has become one of the better writers of contemporary fiction.	2004-03-08

In Masquerade, Lynds' first thriller, she shows some potential and some similarity in style to Robert Ludlum. Overall, however, Masquerade is a book in which I was disappointed and would not recommend. While I am usually willing to suspend belief to a degree in international thrillers, Masquerade just goes out of the stratosphere in this dimension. It's plot, characters and ending are very unbelievable and the dialogue is too corny and unrealistic. On the plus side, Lynds manages to keep the story moving along at a brisk pace and made me want to finish the book to see how it ends.  For this reason and her similarity in style to Ludlum, I plan to read at least one of Lynds' more recent works to see if she has grown in her writing skills. Although I did not enjoy Lynds' first attempt as a writer of international thrillers, she demonstates enough potential to warrant a second chance.	2004-02-27

On the plus side, Odd Thomas has an interesting and suspenseful plot and mostly holds your interest. Further, Koontz's writing style keeps you turning the pages non-stop. However, it is not without some important flaws which kept me from rating it higher. The main character, Odd Thomas, who is only twenty and nevers leaves his small Southern California town is written as if he's a wordly, older more sophisticated person, which, for me, detracted from his credibility. Several of the secondary characters are superficially developed. The plot, while interesting, is drawn out far too long. The most interesting and surprising elements don't occur until the last twenty or so pages. This book could have been much more exciting if it was a good 50-75 pages shorter. Given the high praise from Publishers Weekly, which motivated me to read this book, I had very high expectations for Odd Thomas and expected it to be on a par with Watchers, Intensity, Mr. Murder and Dark Rivers Of The Heart. While, Odd Thomas is an entertaining, at times scary  and, all in all, a worthwhile read, it is not even close to being in the same league as what I consider to be among the best of Koontz.	2004-02-12

Once again, Patterson creates an interesting plot (although not nearly as exciting, surprising and original as many of his earlier Alex Cross books) -- but, also once again, he has become too willing to settle for mediocrity in his writing style. At best, his characters are superficially developed and the dialogue he has his characters speak is barely serviceable and credible. Further, he has gone way overboard in Big Bad Wolf in regards to the writing gimmicks for which he has become known. If you feel you MUST read the latest Patterson, be willing to forego most of the qualities you would normally look for in a good book -- and a good writer. Expect nothing more than a book that will provide light entertainment. Personally, I'm annoyed at myself for buying Big Bad Wolf, as it is just the latest exmple of Patterson knowing that his fans will plunk down their hard earned money regardless of his being increasingly less willing to provide them with the quality he made sure he provided when he was building his reputation. Big Bad Wolf is likely to be the last book from which Patterson will receive any of my money. While I'm not keeping my fingers crossed, it would be nice to see Patterson return to showing interest in having &quot;quality&quot; associated with his works rather than &quot;quantity.&quot; His &quot;paint by numbers&quot; formulaic writing approach has enabled him to spew out 3 or 4 books a year, and thus become an industry unto himself, so to speak. It's probably naive of me to expect him to sacrifice some of the &quot;green&quot; he is raking in in his &quot;quantity vs. quantity&quot; approach to writing -- but I can only hope. As I said, however, I'm not keeping my fingers crossed.	2004-01-24

I put off reading The King Of Torts for a long time due to the many average-to-below average reader reviews posted on Amazon. I'm glad, however, that I finally decided to read it, as it is the best book Grisham has written in a long time. The King Of Torts is about morality (or lack thereof) and greed. Without going into detail, the plot involves a lawyer who decides to give up his job as a lawyer in the Office of the Public Defender after being given the chance to handle a major mass tort case against a pharmaceutical company. He goes on to become the King Of Torts, as well as fabulously wealthy and extremely greedy in a very short time. A lot of information is learned about tort lawyers and their relentless pursuit of major corporations at the slightest whiff of impropriety. Grisham's hero, Clay Carter, can also be considered the villain in this very interesting and exciting thriller. I think what led to many of the negative reviews of Grisham's latest book is not that it is boring or poorly written or unexciting, but more to the contempt he creates about the main character due to the extent of his of greed and immorality. As such, unlike in most thrillers, the reader doesn't have a &quot;good guy&quot; to route for. Further, deep down I think many of the readers crticize the book because of the very good job Grisham does in getting the reader to route for the villain. The King Of Torts is the best book I've read by Grisham in years and, having been steadily dissapointed in many of his more recent, am once again a &quot;big fan&quot; and anxiously awaiting his new book due out in a few weeks, called The Last Juror.	2004-01-24

I've enjoyed all of Joseph Finder's books but Paranoia is unquestionably his best! The plot is very fast-paced, the characters are well-developed and multi-dimensional and the suspense involving corporate spying is non-stop. If this isn't enough to make you want to rush right out to get a copy of this compelling thriller, be aware that Finder provides twists and turns that will keep you intrigued and surprised right up to the very end. Be prepared for a very exciting and fun reading experience. Paranoia will keep you glued to the edge of your seat. It is one of the most enjoyable books I've read in quite awhle. Paranoia deserves to be at the top of the bestseller lists and it should help Joseph Finder become one of the elite group of today's popular writers.	2004-01-14

Having loved Andrews' last book, Icarus, and also liking his first book, Gideon, very much, I couldn't wait to read his new book. Aphrodite doesn't disappoint in terms of being fast-paced and exciting. However, it doesn't compare to Icarus (in particular) in terms of providing pulse-pounding suspense, credible plot twists and turns and an ending that keeps you guessing until the last page. Aphrodite is about a small-town cop &quot;with a past&quot; who uncovers a crime that involves a conspiracy that can have devastating consequences unless he can put a stop to it. Similar to his previous books, Aphrodite grabs your attention from the first page. However, I found the plot dragged too much during the middle of the book and I had some credibility issues with some of the characters, particularly the relative ease with which the hero is able to uncover and stop the major conspiracy. So, while I found Aphrodite to be an enjoyable read, I cannot give it a 5-star rating (as I gave Andrews' other books) because the plot was somewhat predictable without many surprises. Further, I found some of the characters to be unbelievable and not too well-developed (particularly the cop's girlfriend's daughter, who is  too glib for her age). If you're willing to suspend belief a little more than you usually do in reading a thriller, I think you'll find Aphrodite to be a good, entertaining<br />-- but not very memorable -- book.	2004-01-10

Lescroart's strong suits are in his ability to develop multidimensional, credible major as well as secondary characters, believable multilayered story lines, and witty dialogue -- all of which are intertwined in an entertaining, fast-moving mystery. The basic plot involves an HMO executive who becomes a victim of a hit-and-run driver and then a murder victim after being brought to one of his own hospitals for treatment. Dismas Hardy becomes the defense attorney for the doctor presumed to be the murderer and Lt. Glitsky is in charge of the murder investigation. The relationship between Hardy and Glitsky is one I enjoyed very much and am looking forward to learning more about when I read other books in the series. Without going into detail (and perhaps spoiling things for potential readers), what keeps me from giving The Oath a higher rating is that I found its ending to be a bit predictable in some ways and a bit far-fetched in others. Nonetheless, The Oath is worth reading and is a book I think you'll enjoy.	2003-12-31

The Tower, the debut novel by Gregg Andrew Hurwitz, conceptually has all of the elements a good thriller should have; however, it falls short on delivery. The characters are not well developed and are unlikable, and the ending was not very surprising and satisfying. I found myself disliking the hero, Jake Marlow, almost as much as the psychotic killer, Allander Atlasia. As a matter of fact, there wasn't one character I cared about enough to be concerned about what happened to them. The main challenge for me was not to figure out what happens next, but to finish the book as quickly as possible so I can move on to my next book. Hurwitz demonstrates considerable potential to create excitement and suspense; although his ability to sustain this suspense was, all too often, lacking. The Tower is not a bad book. It was good enough to finish but not good enough to recommend -- unless you have an interest in reading a first book by an author who has gone on to receive some very positive acclaim for his subsequent books.	2003-12-16

As was true in The Last Jihad, The Last Days, its sequel, is filled with exciting, suspenseful non-stop action. The plot is based on Jon Bennett's attempt to implement the Arab-Israeli peace plan, of which he is the chief architect. While reading this book I felt like I was on a treadmill that was out of control -- going faster and faster the longer I stayed on. While character development isn't Rosenberg's strong suit and some of his dialogue is at times a bit corny, these deficiencies are mostly overcome by his ability to create a very suspenseful and realistic plot -- a plot that is all too plausible and one that I hope we only have to deal with in fiction. Once you start The Last Days be prepared to change your plans for the next few days because you won't want to put this book down.	2003-12-04

With Forsyth's latest, Avenger, he has catapulted himself back to the forefront of thriller writers. Avenger is for anyone interested in a very well written book with a highly intelligent plot, excellent character development and a pace that -- while not always fast-moving -- will keep your eyes glued to the pages. I should warn you, though, that if you looking for a thriller with lot of slam-bang action, Avenger may not be for you. The basic plot is about a young American volunteer who is killed in Bosnia and the hiring of the Avenger to try to seek vengeance on the person responsible. However, the real plot of this book is much more involved and covert than this -- but is one that I won't describe further so as to not reveal the story line that really makes Avenger suspenseful. All I will say again is what I said in my title for this review -- Some crimes are better left unpunished.	2003-11-30

I have been a big fan of most of David Baldacci's books and loved his first, Absolute Power. However, his newest book, Split Second, is one of the worst books I've read in quite awhile, and I feel so cheated by Baldacci that I'm uncertain if I'll take a chance on future books by him. While Split Second started off like it was going to be an enjoyable book, it deteriorated at warp-speed. The following lists just some of the problems with this stinker -- the plot is unbelievably far-fetched , the dialogue is so amateurish it seems like it was written by a child, the characters are not credible and cartoon-like in their development, the intended suspense is (for the most part) ho-hummish, and the ending -- oh, that ending -- is ridiculous!While I try to find point out good aspects in books that are not so good overall, I cannot do so for this book. The only mystery associated with Split Second for me was why I bothered to finish this very poorly written book.	2003-11-19

Let me start off by saying that I enjoyed The Da Vinci Code very much. However, Angels And Demons was a major disappointment. Is it possible that Brown improved as a writer so much from the time period between writing Angels And Demons and The DaVinci Code? While The Da Vinci Code isn't the most well written book you're likely to read, it is one of the more compelling, interesting and exciting books you're likely to read. In contrast, Angels And Demons possesses none of these positive attributes. The plot moves along at much too slow a pace, the dialogue is unrealistic and stilted, and the characters are not developed well enough. These contrasts are puzzling to me since these two stories are very much alike. Perhaps I've just solved my own puzzlement -- that is, having read The Da Vinci Code first, I was bored with Angels And Demons because it's  essentially a much weaker version of essentially the same plot. Do yourself a favor if you haven't read The Da Vinci Code, go right out and get yourself a copy. BUT once you've read it and enjoyed it do NOT fall into the trap of wanting to read its prequel (Angels And Demons), as I did. Please learn from this reader's mistake. I'm sorry I read Angels and Demons not only because I didn't like it. But because it made me a bit uncertain about whether I want to read Dan Brown's next book -- i.e., which book is the fluke?	2003-10-26

Let me start off by saying that Charleston is an entertaining book -- provided you don't mind a book that is much more focused on telling history than a compelling story with interesting and well-developed characters. If the reverse is &quot;your cup of tea&quot;, Charleston might not be to your taste. I'd suggest his Kent Family Chronicles or his North and South series. Because I have enjoyed all of Jakes's books due to his strong ability to marry historical fact with fiction, Charleston, while good, was somewhat of a letdown for me. In telling the history of Charleston from about 1720 to just past the end of the Civil War, Jakes seems to have gotten off track a bit in regards to what he was trying to do with his story. As a result, I found myself not &quot;knowing&quot; his characters as well as I would have liked and, for the most part, not caring about most of them. Hope this is helpful to you in deciding whether or not to read Charleston. Again, in making your decision please decide carefully if you're okay with a book whose main &quot;character&quot; is the history of a city moreso than the people making up that city.	2003-10-18

Stephen Hunter has been one of my favorite authors since his book, The Day Before Midnight, and I've loved all of his Swagger books, particularly those featuring Bob Lee Swagger. However, Hunter's latest, Havana, was a major disappointment to me. The plot - about the CIA's recruitment of Earl Lee Swagger to Havana to assassinate Fidel Castro - is very simplistic and predictable. The characters are poorly developed and one-dimensional, including some real-life people who appear in this book, such as Fidel Castro, Meyer Lansky and Ernest Hemingway. Even Earl Lee Swagger is not as interesting as in Hot Springs and Pale Horse Coming. Unlike the non-stop excitement and action that permeates all of Hunter's previous books, the suspense in Havana is much more tepid and very sporadic. Very little in the way of suspense really happens until the last 75-100 pages and even then, as I mentioned, you'll probably be able to predict most, if not all, of what eventually occurs. I know that criticizing this book will probably generate many \\"unhelpful\\" votes from Hunter's many fans who are not willing to accept that one of his Swagger books could be deserving of less than 4 stars. However, I'm willing to take this risk since my primary concern is to spare you from - or at least prepare you for - a sub-par performance from Hunter. Hopefully, this review is helpful to you in deciding whether or not you want to read Havana.	2003-10-09

However, this sequel to The Surgeon pales in comparison. For my taste, Gerritsen spent too much time discussing the concerns and fears of her main character, Jane Rizzoli, and not enough with the serial killer, Warren Hoyt and in providing exciting twists and turns. I kept waiting and waiting for the suspense to build to a slam-bang ending; however, the ending was much too abrupt and not very suspenseful, and, thus, left me somewhat disappointed. If you've read The Surgeon and are interested in finding out what happens next, The Apprentice is a worthwhile read. But, as I said, it's far from her best works. I'd recommend that you read some of Gerritsen's earlier books such as Harvest and The Surgeon.	2003-09-25

The basic premise of The Leader And The Damned is interesting -- i.e., the attempt by the Gestapo to kill an English spy to prevent him from revealing that from 1943 on the man supposed to be Hitler was actually his double, and that the real Hitler had died. This book had the potential to be very good and exciting. Unfortunately, what it lacks is an author skilled in being able to make you care about what happens next and in creating believable, three-dimensional characters. Other than Forbes mentioning the names of characters (fictional and real), he provides little to no description of their background, appearance, etc. They are so \\"cardboard-like\\", that I found that it difficult to read on to find out what happens next. There's no question in my mind that with a more skilled writer The Leader And The Damned could have been one of the better WWII thrillers. Instead, at best, I would consider it to be only fair. Unless you have an unsatiable need to read WWII thrillers, do yourself a favor and skip this book.	2003-08-29

Overall I'd give a 3 1/2 star rating to Still Life With Crows. I have been a very big fan of Preston & Child's books, especially Relic, Reliquary and The Cabinet of Curiousities. Having read the first 2/3s of Still Life With Crows, I felt sure this was going to be another of their books worthy of a five star recommendation. Then came the last third! Aside from the chase being much too long and drawn it, which was causing me to lose interest, the ending was ridiculous, ludicrous and unbelievable. And to make matters worse, I guessed who the killer was too early on in the book. As to the principal character, Pendergast, whom I thought was great in The Cabinet Of Curiousities, the authors have made him a little too super-humanish in this book, which, at times, made me feel that it might be good for Preston & Child to \\"retire\\" him, at least for awhile. I don't think this is going to happen, however, at least until after the author's next joint effort, given the the few scenes involving Pendergast and Wren. It seems that their next book might be a sequel to The Cabinet Of Curiousities featuring Pendergast and Wren. All in all, Still Life With Crows isn't a BAD book (even with its very far-fetched ending). It's just that I felt disappointed based on the high standards I've come to expect from these two very talented authors.	2003-08-28

The Last Jihad is a very timely political post-9/11 thriller that will have the pages fly through you fingers. The excitement, suspense and tension builds right from the start and never lets up until the very end. While the characters are not particularly well-developed, the plot more than makes up for this weakness. While not every one is going to agree with the decisions made towards Iraq in this book, I am sure you'll feel that reading The Last Jihad will be like being on a roller-coaster ride that seems out of control. Buckle up and enjoy the ride!	2003-08-05

The Da Vinci Code is a fast-paced, exciting thriller that will hold your interest from the opening pages to the final page. Brown, in his latest thriller, starts you off with a vicious murder in the Louvre and takes you on a search for the Holy Grail. What makes The Da Vinci Code several levels above the average thriller is Brown's ability to use the impeccable research he did to provide a fascinating interpretation of Western history and to describe historical events that are as interesting as the suspenseful murder investigation itself. I think that if you can put aside whatever your strong personal beliefs are about &quot;the Truth&quot; and not take the book too seriously, you'll consider The Da Vinci Code to be among the most interesting and entertaining novels you've read in a long time. The one flaw in this book for me -- and it's a very minor one -- is that Brown could have been more descriptive about the physical appearances of the hero and heroine to enable you to have good picture in your mind about what they looked like. I highly recommend The Da Vinci Code to you. Enjoy!	2003-08-02

A Long Day For Dying is a perfect book to read on the beach or on a plane trip. It's very plot-driven, fast-paced and exciting. However, you really must be willing to stretch your ability to suspend belief, as the plot is somewhat far-fetched. Also, the book is a little thin on character development. While I enjoyed Davis' latest, it's not a book that will make you feel that you have to rush out and buy his other books. It's fast entertainment that will make you want to &quot;turn the pages,&quot; but it's also the type of book that you'll forget about soon after finishing it.	2003-07-21

In The Confessor, Silva, as in The Kill Artist and The English Assassin, calls on his art restorer/Israeli spy-assassin, Gabriel Allon, to investigate the murder of a long-time friend and fellow spy. As part of his investigation, he uncovers a conspiracy within the Vatican pertaining to the Holocaust, which is where the real plot begins and compelling suspense builds and builds right up to its bullets flying, bodies dying ending. While Silva once again relies on what has become a successful formula for him, The Confessor kept me engrossed throughout the book. However, for me, what really made this book rise to the top of its genre is the very interesting, thought-provoking and  controversial perpsective Silva provides on the Vatican's involvement (or lack thereof) during the Holocaust. I've enjoyed all of Silva's books very much and I'd consider The Confessor to be the best of the three featuring Gabriel Allon. Regardless of your personal viewpoint about the controversial subject on which the plot is based, The Confessor is a novel of slow-building but non-stop tension and suspense that will keep you glued to the edge of your seat. Highly recommended!	2003-07-07

Three of Blauner's earlier works--Slow Motion Riot, The Intruder and Man Of The Hour-- were excellent books. Each of which read like thrillers but are really great, adrenaline-pumping fiction. Consistent with these past successes, Blauner's latest, The Last Good Day, is another must-read and may be his best yet. As a matter of fact, referring to this book as a very good -- even an excellent -- thriller does it an injustice. Its strong, well-developed, credible characters, its smart dialogue, its ability to capture the mood and fear in an affluent suburban community shortly following 9/11 and a local murder makes The Last Good Day a book you don't want to put down -- but, at the same time, don't want to see come to an end. Beyond its exciting plot, Blauner has created a work of fiction that places it near the top of a very limited group of books in regards to rich prose and style. Do yourself a favor and put The Last Good Day at the top of your Must Read list. While you're at it, do yourself another favor and pick up copies of Slow Motion Riot, The Intruder and Man Of The Hour as well.	2003-07-02

The last 50 pages or so of Shutter Island were very surpising and made the book, overall, worth reading for me and one which I would recommend to you. Up until this point, however, I kept wavering between feeling that I liked the book a lot and that it was just fair. This is because the book kept jumping between sub-plots and time periods. For me, at various times I found the story a little too convoluted. Perhaps it was because I, at times, didn't pay enough attention to some of the subtle clues that Lehane was providing. As such, my advice to you is that once you start this book be prepared to pay careful attention to all the little details or the ending may not be as clear as you'd like it to be. Shutter Island is not a book to read when you want to read only a few pages before falling asleep. To appreciate this rather complex book, it's one that requires your full attention. I've read all of Dennis Lehane's books and consider him to be one of my top 2-3 favorite authors. Shutter Island is worth reading and recommended, but it is not as rich in suspense and character development as Lehane's previous bestseller, Mystic River. That's a book that I would recommend to you without ANY reservations.	2003-06-23

It's a very compelling, interesting and somewhat challenging read. In Block's Small Town, New York City in the aftermath of 9/11 is really a small town filled with men and women from all walks of life whose aspirations fears, disappointments and triumphs are all interconnected by bonds as unspeakable as they are unseen. The plot involves a series of apparently unconnected serial killings, which in the warped viewpoint of the Carpenter are intended as \\"sacrifices\\" in order to help the city and its dwellers to be reborn out of the chaos and destruction caused by 9/11. Block is at the top of his game in terms of plot development and character development; however, Small Town represents a big departure from what fans of his books have become used to. Small Town is not, as is obvious if you've read the very mixed reviews by other Amazon readers, a book for everyone. Many criticize it for its very graphic and erotic sexual passages as well as for the ending leaving too many threads untied. While I understand how the book could be criticized for these reasons, I, personally, didn't share these opinions. In fact, I think the sexual relationships, while very graphic, were integral to the main story line. And while it's true that some sub-story lines are not as closed as readers expect in a novel, in real life not all stories have a clear, precise ending. As I said, earlier, Small Town is a somewhat challenging read in that you have to really pay attention to some of the small clues Block provides. If you don't, you might find, as I did, that you'll have to go back and reread some areas to understand its connection to the outcome. I hope this review is helpful to you in deciding whether Small Town is a book for you  -- because it's not for everyone.	2003-05-31

If you're looking for an exciting, interesting and informative noirish police procedural that will take you back in time to the days just before, during and after the Kennedy assassination, I very much recommend Wisdom Of The Bones to you. The story is about a Dallas homicide detective's attempt to solve one last case involving a young kidnapped girl before he loses his own life to a terminal heart condition.<br />Hyde is meticulous in his research and is terrific in describing this period with accuracy, grit and lots of color. Further, Hyde's suspenseful thriller is filled with real-life characters, about which he provides interesting and many little-known facts (at least to me) that enables this book to rise above the average historical thriller. Of particular interest to me (and I think will be to you, too) were the \\"factoids\\" Hyde provides about Jack Ruby.  Wisdom Of The Bones is a book that succeeds on many levels ... plot, narrative style, multi-dimensional characters to name just a few ... and is one that will keep you on the edge of your seat and make you want to read on and on. Christopher Hyde's latest is well worth reading and one that should be near the top of your to-be-read list. Also, I'd recommend that you try Hyde's previous historical thriller, The Second Assassin.	2003-05-23

If you're a regular reader of Coben's books, as I am, you know that once you start one of his books you won't be able to put it down. No Second Chance is no exception to the &quot;Coben rule.&quot; With that said, Coben's latest book ranks a notch below his two other stand-alones, Gone For Good and Tell No One. However, it is still a book very much worth reading. While the first two-thirds of No Second Chance is very suspenseful, the last third, while also suspenseful, loses some of its credibility --especially when the character, Verne, is introduced. Further, I found that while Coben ties all of the pieces of his puzzle together well in the end, the ending is somewhat predictable and didn't leave me fully satisfied. These are not MAJOR criticisms and should NOT deter you from reading this book, especially if this is your first book by Coben. For me, these criticisms stem from the fact that I'm not used to any --even minor - -criticisms with Coben's books. He remains one of my favorite authors.	2003-05-09

Par for the course, Deaver's latest Lincoln Rhyme novel is an excellent, very fast-paced thriller, with what an almost never-ending supply of plot twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat in constant suspense -- and that's no illusion. This book is magical in more ways than one -- in its ability to misdirect you at almost every turn in the story, in the &quot;inside&quot; information it provides about some feats of illusion you may have seen done by David Copperfield and David Blane and in its ability to make the hours you spend reading this book seem like minutes. Deaver continues to evolve his main characters, Lincoln Rhyme and Amanda Sachs, as well as many of his supporting characters in a very interesting way that enables this series to stay fresh and exciting.

The last fifty pages or so of James Siegel's first book were very exciting but I almost gave up on this book several times because it was too slow moving and took Siegel much too long to develop his plot. In addition, his senior citizen characters, while not uninteresting, were a bit too stereotypical. I gave Epitaph a three star rating not because of the quality of the book per se (which only deserves a 2-2 1/2 star rating), but because of the potential Siegel demonstrated as a writer of exciting fiction. This potential has been more than lived up to in Siegel's newest book, called Derailed. Derailed is one of the best thrillers I've read in quite awhile, and is a book I'd highly recommend to you. As for recommending Epitaph, I'd say read Derailed first (like I did) and than decide if you want to read his first book to see how far he's progressed from his first effort. If after reading Derailed, you decide you didn't like it, than my recommendation would be to skip Epitaph. Even if you do decide to read Epitaph, I'd recommend you borrow it from the library.	2003-04-13

Once you start reading Derailed be prepared for your life to be derailed until you finish it. Simply stated, Derailed is about an ad executive who makes one stupid mistake that derails his (and others) whole life. The word to summarize this book is &quot;great.&quot; Great writing style (in ways it will remind you of James Patterson's style but Siegel is a MUCH better writer), great characters, and great plot. If that's not enough, Derailed is chock full of suspense and excitement. And if that's still not enough, it's filled with surprises that will keep you guessing and panting for breath right up to the last page. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to a book that will keep you glued to the edge of your seat. I had previously planned to read Harlan Coben's new book (No Second Chance) as my next book, but I enjoyed Derailed so much that I've gotten a copy of James Siegel's first book, Epitaph, and am going to start it right after writing this review.	2003-04-05

Samaritan is another very well wriiten story of urban life, but not up to par with Freedomland and, particularly, Clockers. Price's ability in developing characters that stay with you long after you finish his books and his strength in writing dialogue that is very true-to-life is of a caliber that is unequaled by most popular fiction writers writing today. He has developed stories of his main and minor characters that are very interesting, all of which are intertwined with that of his protagonist, Ray Mitchell. What is lacking for me in Samaritan, and which keeps me from giving it a higher rating, is the development of a very interesting plot. What kept me reading this book was the high quality of Price's writing (5 stars), not the plot itself (3 stars). For me, Clockers and Freedomland, deserved 5 stars on both important factors. Nonetheless, Samaritan is a book worth your time and money. Enjoy!	2003-03-31

Be prepared to rarely get up from your seat once you start Chosen Prey. Sandford's characters are very credible, three dimensional and well-developed, and Lucas Davenport continues to be one of the more interesting &quot;good guys&quot; in crime fiction. The plot is very suspenseful and riveting. In typical Sandord style, there is no surprise as to who the killer is, yet the need for non-stop reading of his books is to see how the killer is caught. If you've read some of the other books in the &quot;Prey&quot; series, you'll know that how the criminal is brought to justice is not always in the way you'd suspect. Chosen Prey is a book I think you'll enjoy very much. As I said, though, be prepared to delay other things you need to do because you won't want to put this book down. It's well worth you're time and money.	2003-03-14

With King's (supposedly) last stand alone book he has accomplished what medical science has been unable to do...he's developed a sure-fire cure for Insomnia. I couldn't understand why whenever I'd pick up this book, I'd fall asleep after reading only a few pages. I wasn't tired when I started reading. Then I realized that it was because From A Buick 8 is mostly very BORING. I'd define the plot as &quot;too little too late.&quot; The supposedly scary &quot;stuff&quot; isn't scary. And the characters are not very credible, not well-developed and -- oh yeah -- not very interesting. I've given this book a 2-star rating as a &quot;going away&quot; present to King. During the first half of his writing career, King was my favorite author and I anxiously awaited his next book. It didn't matter what the book was about, just the fact that &quot;the King&quot; wrote it was enough for me to plunk down my money. However, while I've continued to buy most of King's books in more recent years, I've been continually disappointed -- and From A Buick 8 is no exception. It's not really a BAD book; it's just not worth your time and certainly not worth your money. If this book reflects the best of King's creative juices, it's probably best that he made the decision to put down his pen.	2003-03-08

Having read all of the books Lincoln Child coauthored with Douglas Preston, I was looking forward to reading Child's first solo effort. However, while the concept on which the book is based is interesting, I was very disappointed in Utopia, and would not recommend it. Overall, the plot was much too simplistic and predictable. The characters were not credible or well-developed,and were very stereotypical. And the action tended to sputter along. As another reviewer stated it, \\"Imagine yourself on a roller coaster. You're all hyped up because it's about to start. When it does, you get all excited. Then the ride stops. Then starts again. Then stops. Then starts again\\". That's exactly how I, too, felt while reading Utopia. If Child had spent more time on plot and character development and less on computers, robotics and modern technology, Utopia could have been a very good book. Well, hopefully, when Child pairs up again with Preston, he will redeem himself for this well-conceived but rather poorly executed techno thriller.	2003-03-01

However, if you're looking for a very-fast paced plot that will keep you turning the pages non-stop and provides edge-of-your seat action and suspense, you could do a lot worse than reading Patterson's latest Alex Cross thriller. If you've read any/many of Patterson's previous books, you're familiar with what to expect in Four Blind Mice in regards to writing style, character development, etc. I enjoyed this book a lot and it made for great escape reading on my recent business trip. It made my three hour flight seem like only minutes had gone by. Also, Patterson has provided more depth to the character of John Sampson in this book than in all of his previous books combined, which I found enjoyable. All in all, Four Blind Mice is very entertaining and is a book I think you'll enjoy.	2003-02-06

Shaara's writing style, while not particularly fast-moving, allows the reader to obtain a vivid picture of what life was like during the years leading up to the our colonies' declaration of independence, and of the personal lives of the leading characters on both sides of the conflict. Shaara's depictions of leaders such as John and Samuel Adams, Benjamin Franklin, General Gage, etc. makes you feel like you knew them personally and that you were right along side them while history was being made. If you are a lover of historical fiction or just someone interested in reading an interesting novel about events leading up to the birth of this country, I think Rise To Rebellion is a book that you'll enjoy very much. The only factor that kept me from giving this book a 5-star rating is that Shaara, at times, tended to  dwell too much on some issues that (to me) weren't very interesting or important enough. However, this is a minor criticism and should not deter you from considering this enjoyable and well above-average work of historical fiction. I'm looking forward to reading Shaara's sequel to Rise To Rebellion, titled the Glorious Cause. Enjoy!	2003-02-01

Due to its close, albneit fictitious, association with the show and its producer (Lorne Michaels), the plot of Saturday Night Dead kept me involved in the story moreso than it would have if it was a straight mystery centered around a made-up TV show. However, while the story holds your interest, it is somewhat contrived and the believabilty of some of the characters requires a big stretch of the imagination -- especially, the main character, Harvey Blissberg, who shortly after retiring as a professional baseball player becomes such an adept private-eye that he's able to solve a murder case that the NYC police department can't begin to get close to solving. All this aside, if you're in the mood for a very fast read and a mystery that holds your attention, you could do a lot worse than reading Saturday Night Dead.	2003-01-18

Billy Strobe is a character you won't soon forget and the book is one you won't be able to put down once you start reading it. Martel has risen right to the top of legal thriller writers with this effort. The plot is multi-layered, the characters are very well-developed, the action is non-stop and the description of prison life will make you sure to never want to stray from the straight and narrow. While it could be argued that some of the trial scenes are a bit far-fetched, I personally had no problem with this. If you are in the mood for a legal thriller, or any type of suspenseful book, you'd have to search pretty hard to find a book that will be more captivating than Billy Strobe.

It's very fast-paced and loaded with action and suspense. Further, based on writing style and characterization, &quot;this&quot; Ludlum often surpasses the &quot;real&quot; Ludlum. The Janson Directive is a big book (547 pages) and lots of fun to read (although I think it might have been even better if it been 50-100 pages shorter,which kept me from giving it a 5-star rating).

In typical Follett fashion, Hornet Flight is a very fast-paced, exciting thriller that will keep you glued to your seat. If you're a 'Follett reader' you'll see that his latest book highlights a common theme in this author's WWII novels that lends them particular emotional resonance -- how, beyond the mass movements of armies, it is often the heroic actions of individuals that influences the direction of war. Moreover, these heroic actions are often initiated by women. Hornet's Flight is filled with interesting and credible characters as well as with many twists and turns (although several of them are somewhat predictable, which kep me from rating it five stars). Hornet Flight, which follows the very exciting Jackdaws, restores Follett to the top of his game as a writer of spy inrigue and WWII suspense. I would highly recommend Hornet Nest. Enjoy!	2002-12-06

While Jim Fusilli is an author with potential I was largely disappointed in Closing Time, his first effort. The basic premise is interesting and Fusilli's descriptive abilities of the sights and sounds of New York strongly ring true. However, the plot is too drawn out and Fusilli seems unable to forego describing all the thoughts and feelings of his main character, Terry Orr. By the time I got through the first quarter of Closing Time (about 75 pages), I was spending as much time thinking about what to read next as on the story itself. Closing Time is not a bad book, it's just not an especially good one. If you're into reading the first works of authors with promise, than Closing Time might be worth your time -- but buy in paperback, or better still, get it from the library. Otherwise, since there are so many books and so little time, I'd suggest you skip this book.	2002-11-13

Keep in mind that if you're looking for good literature and/or a strong narrative, and/or well-developed characters, this book --as well as all of James Patterson's other books -- will probably not be to your liking. However, if you're seeking a book whose story is packed with suspense, thrills and surprises, and whose writng style will keep you turning the pages at a rapid pace, then grab yourself a copy of Roses Are Red. I think you'll find that for as long as you're reading this book you'll be able to escape into the world of Alex Cross and forget about everything except what is going to happen next. While I've been disappointed in several of James Patterson's recent books, Roses Are Red has helped me to forget about the past. Enjoy!	2002-11-05

In his first novel, Grant Sutherland has produced a well-written, highly suspenseful (albeit slow-building) thriller about a murder that takes place at the United Nations. In addition to its well-developed plot,which is packed with twists and surprises, Sutherland's characters are believable and multi-dimensional. In many ways, Diplomatic Immunity reminds me of the early works by Robert Ludlum, which, to me, is a high compliment. If you're a thriller lover, or any reader who is seeking a very good book, Diplomatic Immunity is definitely worthy of your consideration. I'm very much looking forward to Sutherland's next book.	2002-10-30

Typical of a book by Philip Margolin, The Associate is written in a style that makes the pages fly by, has an interesting plot and builds to a suspenseful conclusion. It's the type of book that is good for a plane trip or beach vacation. However, unlike most of Margolin's other books, The Associate lacks the intense courtroom drama, his characters are more superficial and the outcome was too predictable. Having read all of Margolin's other books, The Associate, while enjoyable and entertaining, is nowhere near the top of his works. If you, too, are a Margolin fan, I think, on a comparative basis, you might feel mildly disappointed but, overall, I think you'll consider The Associate to be a fun read. If you haven't read Margolin before, I'd very highly recommend Gone But Not Forgotten, Heartstone, The Last Innocent Man, After Dark and Wild Justice.	2002-09-29

I've been a thriller lover most of my life, and am usually pretty forgiving of minor flaws as long as the story is good. Unfortunately, this book is one of those rare exceptions. The plot is very weak and extremely unbelievable and the characters are cardboard figures, uninteresting and poorly developed. The only reason I kept reading it was because of the mostly favorable reviews posted here and I figured the book HAD to get better. The only real mystery involved with The Next President is where was Joseph Flynn's editor and why was it published. The only thrill for me was when I finally came to the end. I know some of you reading this negative review will be skeptical of it since it is in the minority of reviews to date. However, I don't want to see you waste your time and money -- as I did.	2002-09-21

Stephen Carter is an excellent writer but The Emperor Of Ocean Park is not an easy book to read. I'd suggest you only attempt to read this 654 page book when you are willing to invest a lot of time and patience in wading through Carter's extensive descriptive passages in order to for the plot to move along. The plot, itself, while very slow moving, is intelligently crafted. The characters are very well-developed and are probably what is most memorable about this book. On a few occasions early on in the book I had to force myself to keep from moving on to another book due to the snail's pace of the story line, even though I was enjoying the high quality of Carter's writing. All in all, reading The Emperor Of Ocean Park is &quot;work&quot; -- but pleasurable work. I think you'll enjoy this literary mystery but,as I said, only attempt reading it when you're in a particularly patient frame of mind.	2002-09-11

The only factor keeping me from rating it five stars is that the characters, while serviceable for the purposes of THE STORY, were not as well-developed as I would have hoped. Nevertheless, this is a minor detail and should not deter you from reading The Sigma Protocol. I think you'll find that this 528 page book (I read the hardcover version) will keep you turning the pages as fast as your fingers will allow. Get ready for a very enjoyable &quot;escape&quot; reading experience. Enjoy!	2002-08-30

City Of Bones represents another riveting, hard-edged, unforgettable thriller in the continuing series featuring Harry Bosch. In typical Connelly fashion, he's created an intelligent, attention-grabbing plot -- this one involving the finding of evidence of a murder committed over twenty years earlier. Also, as fans of Connelly have come to expect, City Of Bones is filled with well-developed characters, \\"real world\\" dialogue, and lots of surprises. While it can be argued if this is the best in the series or not, it is unquestionably well-worth reading and very enjoyable. I'm looking forward to the next book in the series to see what the future holds for Harry Bosch. Get a copy of City Of Bones and prepare yourself for a highly entertaining mystery.	2002-08-16

Having enjoyed Salinger's, White Darkness, very much, I was very disappointed in this author's first book, Behold The Fire. While the basic plot was okay, Salinger's characters were too shallow and poorly developed, his writing style was too disjointed and after a while I found myself not caring at all about what was to happen next. My main goal became to just finish this book, which was a struggle. While I, obviously, don't recommend Behold The Fire to you, I would highly recommend White Darkness by Salinger. It not only has a well-developed plot and interesting characters, it clearly demonstrates Salinger's improvement as a writer.	2002-08-04

Manhattan South is a fast read, has an interesting story and pretty well-developed characters (for the most part). While the plot moves along at a brisk pace, I didn't think this book deserved more than 3 1/2 stars since there really weren't any surprises and most of the occurences were  predictable. Also, Mackie leaves too many loose ends regarding some of the relationships between some of the characters. Perhaps, however, the author did this intentionally in order to create interest in a sequel or a series involving these characters. Nevertheless, despite these limitations, Manhattan South makes a good beach read or when you're in the mood for a \\"light \\", action-packed police yarn.	2002-07-28

In typical Tess Gerritsen fashion, The Surgeon is a book that gets your attention right from the start and doesn't wane throughout this fast-paced medical thriller. The plot, which is described in many of the earlier reviews, is well-developed and exciting. However, I was a little disappointed in that I was able to guess too many of the events that ultimately occurred and the reasons for them too far in advance. Nonetheless, The Surgeon is well worth reading and should keep you engrossed. Enjoy!	2002-07-22

The Beach House is a book I found to be entertaining, fast-paced, and very difficult to put down; and worthy of a 3 1/2 stars if [it was] allowed such a rating. I'm still trying to figure out why I feel this way overall since the plot, while interesting, is very far-fetched, the characters are superficial, the dialog is often poorly written, the love interest isn't very interesting and the ending is fairly predictable. I find this dichotomy to be characteristic of many of Patterson's books, although The Beach House is better than his other (non-Alex Cross) books. If you're looking for a light read for the beach or when traveling on vacation, one that will hold your attention throughout without making you think too much (if at all), this book should satisfy your needs. However, if you're looking for anything more than an entertaining story, try something else.	2002-07-10

The Cabinet Of Curiosities is the best book by these authors since Relic and Reliquary -- and that's high praise since all of Preston's and Child's books have been very good. If you're looking for a top notch &quot;Summer Read,&quot; you'll have a tough time finding a more exciting and entertaining book than this one. Keep in mind, The Cabinet Of Curiousities is not great literature but it is well-written and is a story that will hold your attention from the first to last page. Without going into the plot details, which has been done in many of the previous reviews, this books is very fast-paced, has captivating characters (some of whom you'll recognize if you've read Relic, Reliquary and Thunderhead by these authors), contains lots of interesting historical and science information, and is filled with suspense and surprises. All in all, The Cabinet Of Curiousities is well-worth your time and money. Enjoy! You're in for a fun reading experience.	2002-07-05

John Katzenbach has been one of my favorite authors -- his stories are always well-written and interesting from beginning to end. Hart's War and The Shadow Man and Just Cause are excellent examples of his work. In The Analyst, Katzenbach has come up with a premise equal to his best works. The basic idea can be summed up in this one line: \\"happy fifty-third birthday, Doctor. Welcome to the first day of your death.... You ruined my life. And now I fully intend to ruin yours.\\" For the first third of the book, I couldn't put it down and the suspense kept mounting. However, while the second third and a good portion of the final third of the book gennerally maintained my interest, I found that it was easy to put down because the story became too drawn out and, at times, predictable. The conclusion was pretty clever but not too unexpected. Overall, The Analyst is a book worth reading but I'd take it from the library or wait for the paperback edition.	2002-06-24

Over the years I've been a fan of William Bayer's books and particularly his Janek mysteries. However, Mirror Maze is definitey a book to skip. The plot was much too disjointed, the characters (even Janek in thsi book) were mostly uninteresting and not very credible, and the action was too sporadic to make me care much about what was going to happen next. I felt like I was in a maze reading this book and all I wanted to do was get out of it so I can move on to my next book. Finally, I took the easy way out and gave up on the book about 2/3s of the way through it.	2002-05-24

After reading many of the very negative reader reviews posted here, I was pleasantly surprised to find The Summons to be very enjoyable. While I wouldn't consider The Summons to be a thriller in the style I've become used to in a Grisham book, the tension Grisham creates is ever-present. The characters, while flawed and not very likable, are credible, the plot is interesting and the pace is fast. I found myself steadily engrossed in the story and liked the somewhat surprising ending; though it is open-ended (and maybe too much so for many of those who gave this book a poor rating).<br />The plot Grisham presents is a simple and believable one. Without going into any detail, two brothers are summoned home by their dying father. Upon the return of one of the brothers, he finds his father dead as well as lots of boxes filled with a substantial amount of money. The plot thickens (so to speak) when he decides to keep the money and not tell anyone. As I said, The Summons is not one of Grisham's best books but it is one that's worth reading and very entertaining.	2002-05-11

All of Harlan Coben's books have been excellent but he has far-surpassed himself in his latest, Gone For Good. Be prepared that when you sit down to start this book you won't want to get up until you finish it. It's one of those books that you don't want to stop reading and, at the same time, never want to end. Gone For Good is a rollercoaster of suspense and a tale of haunting love. Coben's skills in plot and character development, narration, and creating credible, edge-of-the seat suspense keep getting better and better. After reading Tell No One, I wondered if Coben had reached the top of his abilities. While there are some similarities in these two books, Gone For Good is by far Coben's best work to date. Now, I'm wondering again if he's reached his zenith. But, when his next book comes out, I'll be one of the first on line to find out.<br />Without going into detail, Gone For Good is about Will Klein's discovery after eleven years that his older brother, who was accused of murdering the girl Will had loved and disappeared afterwards, may not be &quot;gone for good.&quot; To quote the jacket cover, &quot;In Gone For Good, Harlan Coben has written one of those rare thrillers that will not only make the pulse pound, but stir the heart as well.&quot;<br />Now, rush out and get a copy of Gone For Good and have an immensely enjoyable reading experience!	2002-05-04

If you're looking for an exciting, interesting and informative thriller that will take you back in time to the years preceding the U.S.'s entering WWII, I very much recommend The Second Assassin to you. The story is based on the planned assassination of the King and Queen of England in 1939 during their trip to the U.S. The plan was to destroy any hope of an alliance between Great Britain and the U.S., thus ensuring victory for the Nazis in WWII.<br />Hyde is meticulous in his research and is terrific in describing this period with accuracy, charm and lots of color. Further, Hyde's suspenseful thriller is loaded with real-life characters, about which he provides interesting and many little-known facts (at least to me) that enables this book to rise above the average historical thriller. Of particular interest to me (and I think will be to you, too) were the \\"factoids\\" Hyde provides about Lyndon Johnson, Allen Dulles, John Cardinal Spellman, Joseph Kennedy, Franklin Roosevelt, Vice President Garner, Postmaster Farley, Frank Sinatra -- and, of course, the King and Queen of England. Regardless of the accuracy of the historical details described , The Second Assassin is a book that will keep you on the edge of your seat and make you want to read on and on. My only reason for giving this book 4 1/2 stars and not a 5-star rating is that a few of the clues and planned next steps of the \\"bad guys\\" just seem to fall into the \\"good guys/girl's\\" hands just a little too easily. Putting this minor detail aside, as well as the difference between a 4 1/2 and 5 star rating, The Second Assassin by Christopher Hyde is well worth reading and one that should be near the top of your to-be-read list.<br />If you can find a copy, you might also enjoy A Gathering Of Saints, by Christopher Hyde. This book, published in 1996, like The Second Assassin, is a work of fiction based on historical fact during WWII.<br />Enjoy!	2002-04-28

Up Country is a book that succeeds in many ways by providing:  very interesting and strongly developed characters, a tension-laced plot (although this is not a story that is driven by suspense and action), a highly educational perspective of Vietnam from both a contemporary and historical perspective, and humor via the biting, sarcastic thoughts and comments of the main character, Paul Brenner (who was the protagonist in DeMille's book, The General's Daughter).<br />I know that many of those critical of Up Country found it to be more of a travelogue of a veteran's return to Vietnam 30 years after the war than the type of thriller you've come to expect from DeMille. To some degree I agree with the thoughts about the book seeming like a travelogue, but I very much enjoyed the \\"trip\\" and consider it to be a memorable one. I expect that DeMille plans a sequel to Up Country, and I'm ready to sign up for the experience right now. If you're ready for a somewhat different type of book from DeMille, I think you'll highly enjoy Up Country and consider it to be one of his more memorable works.	2002-04-13

I've been a big fan of John Farris from when he published his first novel -- Harrsion High --while (I believe) he was still a high school student. To me, his best works are The Fury and Sharp Practice. For about the first third of Dragonfly, I thought this book was going to rival his best. However, the last two-thirds became predictable and unrealistic. Farris' depiction of the women in this book are love-starved, easily conned, defenseless and in desparate need of a man's attention. For this male reader, these characters were poorly developed and it seemed more like a Harlequin romance novel than a thriller. While Farris tried hard to create suspense and surprises in Dragonfly, he didn't succeed as far as I'm concerned. Hopefully, Farris will recapture his ability to create edge-of-the-seat suspense, strong plots and credible characters. I'll be looking forward to the return of the &quot;old&quot; Farris in his future books.	2002-03-31

The English Assassin has a lot of good things working for it -- a fast-paced plot, lots of action, decently developed characters, and an interesting historical perspective about the Swiss-Nazi relationship during WWII. I found that I could not put the book down throughout the first half. However, I felt that the second half dragged somewhat and the ending, while still filled with action, left me feeling a bit dissatisfied. This is due to its containing few surprises and being somewhat predictable. Further, Silva's conclusion left some 'threads too loosely tied' for my taste. Perhaps this is because he plans to continue his main character, Gabriel Allon, and his secondary characters, Ari Shamron and Julian Isherwood, all of whom were in Silva's The Kill Artist, in future books. While I continue to like these characters, I think that knowing that he plans to use them in other books detracted from the suspense of the ending. With this said, The English Assassin was an entertaining read and one that I, overall, think you would enjoy. It's just that if you have read Silva's other books, as I have, you might feel that his latest effort isn't among the strongest of his works.<br />Also recommended: All of Daniel Silva's previous books, Snow Wolf by Glenn Meade and Jackdaws by Ken Follett.	2002-03-08

The Devil Knows You're Dead is a very well written book that held my interest throughout -- however, I have been a big fan of this series from the beginning. Mystery fans who are looking for lots of action and suspense may want to skip this book. Relative to several of the other books in this series, there is considerably less physical violence and more --much more-- of a concentration on the emotional havoc and angst that Matthew Scudder is experiencing as he makes his way through his topsy-turvy world. The cases Scudder is working on in The Devil Knows You're Dead are interesting but they are not exciting and action-based. So, if this is what you're looking for in a mystery you probably should choose another book. If you enjoy great character development, interesting and likable secondary characers, vivid and accurate descriptions of the Hell's Kitchen/Clinton section of NYC, then treat yourself to this very good book. Keep in mind it's not the best book in this series but it's one I think you'll enjoy. However, I would strongly recommend that if you haven't read any of the books in this series, you first read at least one or two of the earlier books (e.g., When The Scared Ginmill Closes, A Ticket To The Boneyard, A Dance At The Slaughterhouse, A Walk Among The Tombstones, etc.) before reading The Devil Knows You're Dead. These books will familiarize you what the world of Matthew Scudder has been like. This book serves pretty much as a vehicle to further evolve the main character of Matthew Scudder and to let you know where he's moving to in his life.	2002-02-18

If you a person who enjoys a thriller primarily for its suspense and excitement, Last Man Standing will have the pages flying through your fingertips. While the plot is pretty farfetched and strains credibility, it will most likely hold your interest. However, if strong, believable characters are more, or at least as, important to you as suspense and lots of action when choosing a thriller, then I think you'll feel (as I do) feel that Last Man Standing is entertaining and enjoyable but not fully satisfying. Although it didn't bother me as much as many other reviewers, the &quot;good guy&quot; characters --particularly Web London, the main character-- are too &quot;super hero-ish.&quot; Further, Baldacci's characters in general are two-dimensional at best. Despite these flaws, I found Last Man Standing to be a fast-paced an entertaining read; and a book that I think you might enjoy when you're in the mood to read a book to purely escape from reality.	2002-02-09

Faded Coat Of Blue, Owen Parry's debut novel of historical suspense in his series featuring Abel Jones is a worthwhile read. However, while deciding on whether to read this book, make sure that your interest skews more to the history element than the mystery element. Parry's historical recreation of the Civil War period in and around Washington D.C. is very interesting and insightful, his narrative skills are excellent, and his dvelopment of his hero, Abel Jones is first rate. The combination of Parry's abilities in these areas makes you feel that you are right there along side Jones in this turbulent period of the nation's history. Be aware, however, that Faded Coat Of Blue is more a novel of historical fiction than a mystery. The mystery element is not very mysterious and somehat predictable; and serves more as the vehicle to convey the history of the time period and to develop the very likable Abel Jones. If this is acceptable to you, I think you'll enjoy Fade Coat Of Blue very much and go on to read the next two books in the series (as I plan to do). However, if your interest lies more in reading a mystery that will keep you guessing and &quot;on the edge of your seat,&quot; you may want to skip this book.Whatever, your decision, I hope you enjoy your next reading experience!	2002-01-19

Though not as good as Eye Of The Needle or The Key To Rebecca, Jackdaws is Follett's best book in many years. The tension constantly builds and the action is non-stop. For pure suspense-reading, Jackdaws will have you biting your nails and on the edge of your seat. However, Jackdaws falls short of deserving a 5-star rating from me because, with the exception of Flick and Dieter Franck, many of his characters served as &quot;tools&quot; to tell this action-packed WWII thriller and were not developed well enough to truly care (one way or the other) about. While I thought this criticism would be important for you to know, I would highly recommend Jackdaws if you're in the mood for a novel of suspense set in the most dangerous days of WWII.	2002-01-06

Steven Salinger's second novel, White Darkness, is a very strong follow-up to his highly praised debut book, Behold The Fire. White Darkness is an exciting urban-Caribbean thriller that represents a refreshing and interesting introduction to the genre. It grabs hold of your attention from the first page and doesn't let go until the last page. It's the type of book that you just want to keep reading to see what happens next -- but also one you don't want to see end. White Darkness is more than just a very good thriller with characters you really feel you know, it's a story of the American Dream, the new immigrant experience and an evil that transcends peoples and cultures. I would have, if possible in Amazon's system, rated this book 4 1/2 stars. I didn't rate it 5 stars because some of the plot was too contrived and because Salinger didn't tie together some of the plot twists and relationships tightly enough. Nonetheless, these minor flaws should not deter you from putting White Darkness high up on your To-Be-Read list. Enjoy!	2001-12-27

Unlike James Patterson in his book, First To Die, Iles has created a female protagonist that is very credible, strong and one you grow very fond of and really care about. I came close to giving Dead Sleep a 5-star rating; but didn't because the ending, while enjoyable, was a bit contrived. This, however, is a minor flaw, at most, and should not deter you from reading this book. As a matter of fact, if you haven't already done so, you should read all of Iles' books. While all thrillers, they are all very different from each other. What they have in common is a creator who is extremely talented. In just a few years, Iles has established hinself as an author whose books I make it a point to buy just because he wrote them. What the story is about is almost inconsequential because I have confidence, based on past experience, that it will be a real page-turner. Enjoy!	2001-12-22

Sheldon Siegel's second novel, Incriminating Evidence, is every bit as good as his very good first book, Special Circumstances; and he deserves to be placed in the top-tier of legal thriller writers. Siegel's characters are very well-developed -- particularly his continuing protagonist, Mike Daley, and his ex-wife and law partner, Rosie -- and the plot is fast-paced and bristles with energy. Siegel's ability to combine excitement, surprises, humor and suspense makes Incriminating Evidence a book that you won't want to put down. Without going into detail for fear of providing information which might weaken some of the story's suspense for you, the only thing that kept me from rating this book a '5' is that I felt slightly--and I emphasize 'slightly'-- disappointed in the ending. Nevertheless, Incriminating Evidence is a book I know you'll enjoy and will want to recommend to your friends.	2001-12-09
US	52947290	R2WAL8MHL5WGRX	0451409450	553807381	Darkness Bound	Books	3	3	5	N	N	An Okay Debut!	Darkness Bound, Larry Brooks' first novel, starts off very strong and maintains its strength through the first two-thirds of the book. I'd rate  the book &quot;4 stars&quot; up to this point. However, the last third only gets a &quot;2 star&quot; rating, as it didn't sustain my interest and all I wanted to do was finish the book so I could move on to my next one. The basic problem for me is that Brooks introduced so many plot twists -- most of which I was able to anticipate --that the story became too far-fetched and I found myself not caring about any of the characters. As for the book being promoted as an erotic thriller, the erotism is tepid, at best. Overall, Brooks has a writing style that makes Darkness Bound a fast read, and he definitely does have potential. Hopefully, his next book will be stronger on credible character  and plot development.	2001-11-21

Term Limits is a good first effort from Vince Flynn and I plan to read his other novels. The book is filled with action, which makes you turn the pages at an increasingly fast rate. For me, however, the plot, while interesting, went somewhat over the limit to which I am willing to extend belief. Further, none of the characters -- both the supposedly &quot;good guys&quot; and the &quot;bad guys&quot; -- are ones you care much about and it's often hard to distinguish between the good and the bad. As a result, I thought Term Limits is worthy of reading but only deserving of a &quot;good/3 star&quot; rating.	2001-11-16

If this is your first book by Stephen Hunter you'd probably give this book four stars, possibly more. However, having read Point Of Impact, Dirty White Boys, Time To Hunt, Hot Springs etc., Hunter's latest effort doesn't quite measure up. The first half of Pale Horse Coming was in typical Hunter fashion -- action upon action, details about guns, a Swaggert being larger than life. I couldn't put the book down! The second half, however, dragged in too many areas and the action slowed down considerably. Further, many of the events that occurred were somewhat predictable. Overall, Pale Horse Rising is a book I think you'll like -- you just won't love it -- an emotion that true Hunter fans have come to expect (demand?) from his books!	2001-10-27

Having read all the favorable reviews...prior to reading Fatal Voyage, I was really looking forward to an exciting, suspenseful story. While the plot starts off strong and, for the most part, held my interest, I was expecting much more. I'd describe the suspense tepid, the characters only moderately interesting and the climax just mildly satisfying. Overall, by the time I approached the final quarter of Fatal Voyage, I was more interested in finishing the book than caring a lot about how it ended. Overall, Fatal Voyage is not a bad book -- it's just average. I will read another Reichs book but not in the near future.	2001-10-16
US	52947290	R1W410W5KRK8PR	0553258745	512132225	Paladin	Books	2	2	3	N	N	Just Fair!	The Paladin is supposedly a novel based on facts, as told to the author by &quot;Christopher Creighton.&quot; Creighton, the paladin, was recruited as a teenage boy by Winston Churchill during WWII and sent around the world on missions of state -- usually violent missions. The premise of this novel seemed very appealing to me, as I am a big fan of WWII novels. However, overall, I was disappointed in this novel. To me, the book reads more like a CHRONICLE of Creighton's individual, exciting missions rather than a good NOVEL. I found the book just adequate (at best) in terms of plot development, character development (particularly regarding the secondary characters), and believable dialogue. There's no question that the missions Creighton supposedly carried out for his country were extremely heroic. If these supposedly previously untold missions were written as a non-fiction historical biography about Creighton, I would have had different expectations going in and might have enjoyed the book more. In a good novel, however, as mentioned, I'm looking for more than just an interesting chronicle of facts.	2001-09-22

Demolition Angel is very well written and will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout most of this dark thriller. As to the plot, Crais demonstrates his ability to introduce bombshell after bombshell that, at least figuratively, will &quot;blow you away.&quot; Crais also creates very strong, credible and interesting characters. Carol Starkey, the main character, while not always very likable, is one of the more powerful and multi-dimensional female protagonists I've come across in quite some time. In many ways she reminds me of Clarice Starling. Further, I guarantee you won't be able to forget &quot;Mr. Red.&quot; While I rated Demolition Angel 4 stars, I would have liked to be able to give it 4 1/2 stars. It just falls short of a 5-star rating, due to its dragging very slightly in some sections. Demolition Angel is one of the better thrillers I've read in at least the past six months, and is one I'd definitely recommend that you include  near the top of your reading list. Enjoy!	2001-09-18

While some reviewers felt that the first 90-100 pages were slow moving, I found that I did not want to put this book down from the very first page. Icarus is one of those rare books that the less you know about before starting it, the more exciting, surprising and suspenseful it will be to you. While I know it's hard to spend money on a book without knowing what it's about, this is definitely a book that should be the exception to the rule. The style of writing is very easy to read, the plot is very fast-paced, the action is non-stop (particularly in the second half of the book), and the characters are very credible. If this isn't enough to motivate you to put Icarus at the top of your &quot;To Be Read&quot; list, than maybe this will do it for you -- you won't guess who the killer is. Even if you do, it won't be until towards the very end of the book, and by that point you'll have probably gone through a list of characters who you thought &quot;did it.&quot; Icarus is the most enjoyable thriller I've read in quite a while. Do yourself two favors -- 1) don't read any reviews that describe the plot, and 2) go right out and get a copy of Icarus (and don't be tempted to read the inside flap. It will take away from some of the suspense!). Also, if you have a little more money to spend, get a copy of Russell Andrews' first book, Gideon.	2001-09-08
US	52947290	R1G9RW5IW799BR	0743417208	721404877	The Last Vampire: A Novel	Books	3	2	2	N	N	A Good Read -- 3 1/2 Stars!	Overall, I'd give The Last Vampire 3 1/2 stars if this was possible in Amazon's rating system. In terms of originality and imagination, The Last Vampire has few equals in this genre, and Miriam Blaylock is a character you won't be likely to forget. Strieber does a very good job in creating a new theory about how and why the human race evolved, and in presenting the lore of the Keepers. On these dimensions, The Last Vampire is worthy of at least a 4 star rating and possibly 5 stars. What brings me to give the book an overall rating of 31/2 stars is the inconsistency in the pace of the plot and in the dialogue. For me, there were some passages where the pace and dialogue were so fast-moving and crisp that I couldn't put the book down. However, there were several times where the opposite was true -- the plot tended to get bogged down and the dialogue was too phony and unrealistic. Also, while the ending was exciting, it was somewhat contrived and a little bit unsatisfying. It seems that Strieber's greater purpose for this ending was to provide for yet another sequel rather than a true &quot;ending&quot; to this story. As you may know, The Last Vampire is a sequel to The Hunger (which was Strieber's second book written in 1981), which, too me, is a classic in this genre. If you haven't read The Hunger, please do so. It's my second favorite vampire-related book; surpassed only by Strieber's first book, The Wolfen. Also, if you plan to read The Last Vampire -- and it is worth reading -- do yourself a favor and read The Hunger first. It will give you a much greater understanding of Miriam Blaylock, as well as to Sarah Roberts, one of the main supporting characters. Enjoy!	2001-08-26

Cry Wolf is the mediocre result you get when an author tries to go back and convert an earlier effort which was in the &quot;romance&quot; genre --the genre in which Tami Hoag started writing -- into a thriller -- the genre in which Hoag has achieved her fame.<br />Until Cry Wolf, I have been a big fan of Tami Hoag, enjoying thrillers such as Night Sins, Guilty As Sin, etc. very much. Cry Wolf, however, is mostly a soap opera. The mystery/suspense doesn't even begin to come into play until about 1/2 way into this 529 page paperback. Since I am an avid reader of thrillers, I was somewhat disappointed that, despite the fact that a number of murders did happen, the suspense was unsatisfying for me. I kept hoping that as I read on the suspense would build; but, it did not. Bottom line is if you're a &quot;romance&quot; reader who likes some mystery/suspense, this is a book you'll enjoy (and probably a lot). However, this book will probably disappoint you, as it did me, if you are a thriller lover looking for an exciting &quot;read.&quot;	2001-08-09

Brian Haig (son of Alexander Haig) is a fresh new &quot;voice&quot; in  popular fiction. His style of writing -- part witty, part sarcastic and always interesting -- makes Secret Sanction a book to put near the top of your &quot;To Be Read&quot; list. I think you'll be captivated by the story (which moves along at a very crisp pace), the characters ( which are believable and multi-dimensional), and Haig's knowledge of military honor, tradition and politics. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to Haig's first effort. There's no doubt in my mind that you'll like Secret Sanction a lot and be looking forward to Haig's next book. The only reason I didn't rate the book a &quot;5&quot; is that I anticipated the ending a little too far in advance of where I would have liked, since the earlier reviews I read on Amazon led me to believe the ending was a major surprise. However, the actual rating level here is not really that relevant. What is relevant is that this is a book you'll be glad to read.	2001-07-30

Drury has written this book in the same style as Advise and Consent and some of his earlier bestsellers, but that's where the comparison ends. A Thing Of State only mildly holds your attention. Too little happens over long passages to keep you engrossed. On a few occasions I even thought about giving up on it. While Drury continues to demonstrate his strong knowledge of high level politics (although you might not agree with his personal opinions), my basic reaction to this is WHO CARES if he's not telling a story that sustains my interest.

However, after reading a few hundred pages, I started to realize I didn't care about the characters due to the one-dimensionality Ellroy gives them. Further, the plot, while moving at a fast-pace, was not well-developed and I was really tiring of Ellroy's writing style. While I pushed myself to read further(largely because I had already bought Ellroy's sequel to American Tabloid, The Cold Six Thousand), I finally had to give up on it after getting to the half way point. Now I have to see if I can exchange The Cold Six Thousand. I know many of you reading this review will be skeptical given the many very favorable reviews previously written about American Tabloid. The only thing I can say to this is if you feel you must read this book, take it from the library. Please don't waste your money like I did.	2001-06-29

Once you start Tell No One, its twist-filled plot, interesting characters, and subtely humorous, yet realistic dialogue will make you forget everything else around you. If you're a fan of the Bolitar series, you'll be more than pleased by having to wait for the series to continue.

The author's ability to describe in such a poignant and haunting manner the lives of the six men attributed with raising the flag on Iwo Jima before, during and after the event left me spellbound. Further, it made me once again appreciate a generation of Americans that Tom Brokaw refers to as the \\"greatest generation.\\" Flags Of Our Fathers should be read by all Americans, and especially the younger generations, who have an interest in understanding the terror of war and the impact it has on those lucky enough to survive it.	2001-06-13

I enjoyed the basic plot Patterson has created; I only wish he'd remember how to &quot;write&quot; a story that has credible characters with some depth to them. A particular concern is Patterson's inability to write in the first person about a woman protagonist. Her feelings come across as too cliched. His description of Lindsay's, the main character, romance with her new love interest is too sappy. His other characters are mostly one-dimensional and I often had trouble getting into their heads (and after awhile I gave up trying to). Lastly, his dialogue is at best mediocre and, at times, is childish and unrealistic. While I don't often let these criticisms interfere with my ability to enjoy a book, this wasn't the case for me with First To Die. I found these criticisms to be distracting and annoying enough to prevent me from rating this book with any more than 2 1/2 stars. I doubt I'll be buying any more books in this series, and if I do it won't be in hardcover.	2001-06-04

Shame The Devil is the first book I've read by George Pelicanos -- but it certainly won't be the last. As a matter of fact, I've already bought his latest mystery, Right As Rain. Shame The Devil is chocked full of the qualities you want in a book -- interesting main plot and sub-plots, very well-developed &quot;good guys&quot;(particuarly Nick Stefanos)and &quot;bad guys&quot;, lots of action, strong, realistic dialogue and a writing style that makes you want to turn the pages as fast as you can. The only quality that I found to be a bit unrealistic is the degree of knowledge so many of the characters have about different styles of music. At this point, Dennis Lehane is my favorite mystery writer but Pelicanos has the potential to be his equal. Do yourself a favor and get a copy of Shame The Devil. Enjoy!	2001-04-28

However, the plot, which is somewhat simplistic, and the characters, which are only fairly well-developed, deserve only 2 1/2 stars.

The plot is fast-moving, exciting and has lots of action. However, too frequently the action is predictable with not many real surprises. Furhter, without going into detail, several of the characters and some of the plot twists, while interesting, were too over the top and contrived for my taste.

Dennis Lehane's psychological thriller, Mystic River is his best book to-date, which is quite a compliment given that each of his five previous books were very, very good. In my opinion, Lehane is now the king of the mystery thriller genre. Mystic River is much more than a well-told story. It is a masterpiece of passionate narrative and deeply moving characterizations. In Mystic River Lehane tells a great story of love, loyalty, faith and family, in which three former childhood friends find themselves in adult life on an unalterable crash course with the dark truths of their own pysches. I highly recommend that you get a copy of Mystic River as soon as possible and move it immediately to the top of your to-be-read list.	2001-03-10

Spanning 90 years, Lorenzo Carcaterra's Gangster provides a stirring perspective on the ways of mobsters and their history; all of which is encased in a fine and moving characterization of the enigmatic Angelo Vestieri and his partner, Pudge. Gangster is a fast-paced saga loaded with richly developed characters and true-to-life dialogue that could only be written by an author who grew up in a neighborhood and with people similar to those portrayed in this book. If you read Carcaterra's excellent book, Sleepers, you'll know what I mean (and if you haven't, you should). While engrossed in the action-packed plot of Gangster, you won't be able to miss the three themes that resonate throughout this talented author's powerful new novel -- love, violence and destiny. If you like books about the Mafia and/or are interested in understanding the psychology of gangsters, Gangster is a book I'd have rated 4 1/2 stars if Amazon allowed and it is one I'd highly recommend to you. It is well worth reading. Enjoy!	2001-02-27

Given you know the killer(s) early on, there is not as much suspense as I've come to expect from John Sandford, especially from the early Prey books in the series. I'm afraid that Sandford is running out of credible plots and interesting, believable villains, and it might be time for Sandford to consider retiring Lucas Davenport. While I'm not ready to give up on this series, I'm going to need to see a lot of positive reader support before I buy another Sandford book. Bottom line is that Certain Prey is a book that holds your attention but does not live up to expectations.	2001-01-26

From The Corner Of His Eye is another in the long list of compulsive page turners from Dean Koontz that will keep you on the edge of your seat. In many ways Koontz is at the top of his craft in his latest book. Not only is From The Corner Of His Eye is a top-notch thriller, it is perhaps his most emotionally powerful and complex book to-date -- describing themes such as love and hate, joy and terror and triumph and tragedy. Further, his cast of characters are so well-presented that many of them wiil stay in your mind long after you've finished the book. One factor, however, keeps me from giving From The Corner Of His Eye a 5-star rating. That is, Koontz focused so much of his effort on creating a narrative tour de force and many rich characterizations, he at times let the pace of the suspense slow down too much. The saying &quot;Sometimes less is better&quot; applies to this book. From The Corner Of His Eye, at 622 pages, probably would have earned 5-stars from me if it had been edited down to about 500 pages or so. Nonetheless, Koontz's latest book is well worth reading.

Michael Connelly's newest book, A Darkness More Than Night, features Terry McCaleb and Jaye Winston (from Blood Work)and Harry Bosch in a thriller that will definitely keep you glued to your seat. Be prepared for the pages to seem that they they are flying through your fingers. If you liked Blood Work, you'll greatly enjoy seeing how McCaleb tries to once again see inside a horrifyingly deranged criminal mind. What he uncovers, however, will not seem possible. In typical Connelly fashion, he develops characters, both good and bad, that are very well-developed and ones you'll feel are very real. Further, his plot will keep you engrossed from first page to last. Don't hesitate to add A Darkness More Than Night to your must-read list.	2001-01-24

Overall, Code To Zero is a fast and enjoyable &quot;read&quot;. However, its suspense gradually wanes and the so-called &quot;surprises&quot; and eventual outcome become somewhat predictable. Further, you might feel that you have to suspend belief more than you are willing to in regards to the ease with which the main character:  1) discovers who he is and what he does after learning he has amnesia; and  2) uncovers the plot to sabotage the U.S.'s launching of its Explorer I satellite.<br />Code To Zero, despite its limitations, is worth reading but I'd suggest you take it from the library. There are better books on which to plunk down $26.95.	2001-01-05

Be warned, however, that much of what is written about DiMaggio will make you realize that he may not have been as deserving of the pedestal on which the American public allowed him to live his life. Rather, Cramer makes DiMaggio less of an icon and more like what the rest of us are -- mere mortals and very human. Cramer certainly gives DiMaggio his due as an outstanding baseball player and worthy of the legendary status he still holds. However, he does not mince words in describing DiMaggio's frailties as a husband and father as well as his self-centeredness and, oftentimes, selfishness as a friend and business associate. While DiMaggio has been loved and worshiped by millions of people for his heroic baseball accomplishments, he appears to have lived much of his private life -- particularly his post-baseball life -- as a lonely and unhappy man.<br />Richard Ben Cramer's &quot;Joe DiMaggio: A Hero's Life&quot; is much more than a biography about a baseball player. It is a book that transcends the game and it's players and very clearly makes evident that the public image created by the media about our heroes may not be true representations of what these people are really like. Much controversy has surrounded this book in terms of the honesty in which Cramer portrays various episodes about DiMaggio's life. Regardless of how much of what is written is true, this is a book that is well worth reading and one I'd highly recommend.	2000-12-23

Unfortunately, I can't give this book more than just a &quot;fair&quot; rating (i.e. 2 stars) for two reasons. One reason is that Altman's characters lack sufficient depth for me to care about any of them. The second reason is that while the plot takes many twists and turns, many of them lack credibility and are too predictable. I think Altman has the potential to be a future bestselling author and a writer of well-written books. However,unlike some other reviewers, in my opinion, this particular work does not deserve for Altman to be compared to some of today's better spy thriller authors. Maybe he'll be deserving of this comparison in the future, but not now.	2000-12-02

Putting this very minor detail aside, Storm has it all -- a slam-bang plot, lots of surprises,and very interesting characters. As good as Storm is, however, it's not as good as Starling's first book, Messiah; which I thought was great. If you haven't read Messiah, do so fast.

The Pledge is a fast-paced and exciting debut by Ron Kean that will most likely find wide appeal among both younger and older readers. It will definitely hold your attention from beginning to end. So why a &quot;3&quot; rating and not higher? Basically because the plot and characters, while interesting, tended to stretch my willingness to extend credibility beyond the breaking point in too many instances. While I understand this is a work of fiction and some implausability is 'allowed&quot; in order to maintain suspense, The Pledge, for me, went too far too often to rate it more than three stars. Nonetheless, The Pledge is worth reading  and I'm looking forward to Kean's next book.	2000-11-18

David Clement-Davies's first novel is a truly excellent book for readers young and old alike. Fire Bringer is a gripping saga that draws you into an animal world that is at once incredibly convincing yet also a sharp reflection of our own. Epic but suspenseful and swiftly paced, Fire Bringer follows closely in the tradition of another beloved fantasy and one of my all-time favorite books, Watership Down. It is a story of war and healing, cast with unforgettable characters -- particularly Rannoch -- and told with the resonance of legend. Fire Bringer has the ability to be a classic fantasy and is perhaps the best book I've read this year. I don't give 5 star ratings often but Fire Starter is definitely worthy of it. Do yourself a favor and get a copy as soon as you can.	2000-11-04

As he did so well in his Civil War trilogy and Kent Family Chronicles series, in On Secret Service John Jakes provides a very fast-paced story while blending in lots of interesting and little known facts about the Civil War and the role of the secret service. Also typical of his other works, Jakes provides such vivid descripions of his &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; characters (both real-life and fictional) and of the historical period that I felt that I was right there observing these people and events -- rather than just a reader of a vey good book.<br />On Secret Service has something for all readers -- lots of action, lots of interesting facts about the period before, during and immediately after the Civil War, well-developed characters, and romance. It is a book that I think you will enjoy very much. Actually, if the Amazon rating system allowed it, I would have given On Secret Service 4 1/2 stars. Enjoy!	2000-09-21

Margolin's latest, Wild Justice, is VERY fast-paced, exciting and  suspenseful. Without giving away the plot, I know you'll feel that once you  start reading this book it will seem that the pages are just flying past  your eyes. If you like thrillers, you won't find many recent books in this  genre that will stack up to Wild Justice. The only reason that I didn't  give Wild Justice a &quot;5 star&quot; rating is that despite Margolin's  many and interesting efforts to keep you guessing as to who the murderer  is, I was able to determine the killer too early on in the story. Even if  this turns out to be your experience as well, I think you'll still feel  that Wild Justice is a book that will keep you on the edge of your seat and  is one that you'll want to recommend to others.

However, also typical of  McBain&quot;s mysteries is the fact that the police detectives he regularly  has &quot;star&quot; in his books are secondary to his plots and, thus, are  only superficially developed. Having read many of the books in this series,  I don't feel that I know his characters in any, or at least much, more  depth than after the first 87th Precinct book I read. You must be willing  to accept the fact that you're not going to get much more than a good story  from McBain in this series. This usually has been enough for me. But to be  honest, having read the books in the series by Dennis Lehane, Michael  Connelly and Harlan Coben, where you not only get very good and exciting  mysteries but well-developed characters, McBain's 87th Precinct series has  been steadily losing its appeal to me.	2000-09-01

A Conspiracy Of Paper has it all -- very well developed and interesting characters  (particularly Benjamin Weaver), an exciting and mysterious plot, an ability  to make early 18th century London come alive for the reader,and a  compelling historical perspective of the London stock market in its  infancy, the criminal underworld, the powerful business elite and of  anti-semitism. There is no question about the depth of research that Liss  conducted to write this book, but what makes A Conspiracy Of Paper so  special is the way he successfully manages to weave all of this research  into a novel that will have you totally engrossed and glued to your seat.  Do yourself a favor and read this book as soon as possible. I think you'll  definitely enjoy the trip back in time!	2000-08-30

Overall, Everbody Dies will maintain your interest, although  it is not a book that will keep you glued to your seat. Further, it is not  in quite the same class as many of the earlier Scudder books -- e.g. When  The Sacred Ginmill Closes, A Dance At The Slaughterhouse, and Sins Of The  Fathers. Like some other reviewers, I'm starting to be concerned that Block  is losing some of his edge in this series. Scudder continues to be one of  my favorite fictional characters and I'll remain a loyal reader of this  series with the hope that Block will return to his earlier form.	2000-08-19

The Trench is very fast-paced and  the many scenes in which the Meg attacks just about anything in sight will  make you think twice about going back into the ocean --even if you're in a  boat! If you are looking for a book that will hold your attention but make  no demands on your intellect, The Trench will be a decent choice. Keep in  mind, though, that the writing is just okay, the characters are not  particularly well-developed and the dialogue is at times unrealistic.  However, the plot moves along at a brisk enough pace that I think you will  overlook these deficiencies. Happy reading!	2000-08-10

Overall, I would have rated 24 Hours 3 1/2 stars if it were possible to do so in Amazon's rating system. In 24 Hours Iles has delivered another book  that moves along at a galloping pace and is packed with lots of suspense.  I'd rate this book 4 1/2 stars on these qualities. Unfortunately, I found  that I was able to predict much of the action and, in particular, the  ending, well in advance of their occurences. Also, while the story is  interesting and enjoyable to read, I found that Iles' often severely  strained my ability to extend belief in his main characters. Thus, I'd give  only 2 1/2 stars to 24 Hours on the dimensions of believability and  credibility. Further, while not a major criticism, I would have liked 24  Hours even more if he had provided a brief epilogue to tie up some of the  loose threads in the story. Having finished 24 Hours, I have now read all  five books Greg Iles has written and I would recommend them all to you.  However, if you are considering reading your first book by Iles, I'd  recommend Mortal Fear and The Quiet Game above 24 Hours. Enjoy!	2000-08-10

However, Reich's writing style has made his latest suspense thriller somewhat lacking in &quot;the stuff&quot;  I need to keep me, and I think many readers of this genre need to keep  them, on &quot;the edge of their seat.&quot; For instance, the main  character and key supporting characters are not interesting enough, and so  I found myself not caring as much as I probably should have about what  happens to them. Further, the action sequences were not plentiful enough  for my taste and were too spread out when they did occur. As a consequence  of these limitations, I found The Runner, overall, to be moderately  enjoyable but a book that was easy for me to put down to do other things  and not be in a rush to get back to.	2000-07-26

Actually I would give The Homing an overall rating of 3 1/2 stars if Amazon's system allowed for this. The intensity with which the story is told deserves a 4-star rating, as your eyes will fly across the page to see  what happens next. However, the quality of the writing, dialogue and  character deveopment deserves only a 3-star rating. If you can accept the  implausibility of the plot (which I think you have to do to enjoy a book in  the horror-SF genre) and put aside any strong desire for literary quality,  The Homing will provide you with several hours of excitement and horror.  I'm pretty sure that after you read this book you'll never think the same  way about bees again. I know I won't be able to!	2000-07-16

If you enjoy books about the Mafia, you won't want to miss Sicilian Blood by Darryl London. This is a sequel to London's Respect, which was also very good. The plot moves along at a brisk  pace, the characters are  well-developed and highly memorable (particularly Bephino Menesiero) and  your attention is captured from the first to last page. While Sicilian  Blood (and Respect) never got the promotional support to make them big  sellers, both deserved to be. A third book was to be written to complete  the planned trilogy, but I don't think it was published. Don't be concerned  about this, as both books can &quot;stand alone.&quot; A caution -- be  prepared for lots of very descriptive violence and sex; although to me,  these characteristics added to the book's excitement. Sicilian Blood is  out-of-print and I think Respect is as well. But if your library or used  book store has a copy, do yourself a favor and read them. They are both as  good as Mario Puzo's new Mafia book, Omerta, which will become a big  bestseller, and deservedly so.	2000-07-08

It well deserves the large reading audience it will definitely attract. Typical of all of Puzo's books, Omerta grabs your attention and never lets go, it's  filled with action and suspense, and it's loaded with interesting  characters. Omerta' s greatest quality, however, is Puzo's narrative style,  in which you can feel every emotion his characters are feeling and vividly  picture every setting in which his characters appear. Omerta is without  question a fitting memorial to a great writer. The only reason I didn't  give Omerta a 5-star rating is that would make it equivalent to 'The  Godfather', which it is not. But than again, how many books are? Make  yourself an offer you can't refuse and buy a copy of Omerta. Enjoy!	2000-07-07

You enjoy it while chewing it but forget about it immediately once you're through with it. Baldacci provides enough action in this political thriller to  maintain your interest, although much of the suspense and interplay between  the characters is somewhat predictable. While I enjoyed reading Saving  Faith, it is certainly not among his best books. However, I don't agree  that it is as bad as many of the earlier rewiewers consider it to be. If  you're looking for light beach reading that is fast-paced, mildly exciting  and will hold your interest, give Saving Faith a try. But if you have not  read Baldacci before, I'd suggest you start by reading one of his other  books --especially Absolute Power.	2000-07-04

Hot Springs is another in the line of fast-paced, highly entertaining, action-packed books from Stephen Hunter. This one has Bob Lee Swagger's father, Earl, as the main character. As you will see if you are a fan of  Hunter's books, several of the characters appearing in Hot Springs were  also in Dirty White Boys (whose setting is several years later). In the  absolute, Hot Springs is a book I enjoyed a lot and I think you will, too.  Comparatively, however, it does not quite measure up to Hunter's more  recent books (i.e. Point Of Impact, Dirty White Boys, Black Light and Time  To Hunt)in terms of suspense and credibility. But don't let this deter you  from reading Hot Springs. As I said, it is a very enjoyable book.	2000-06-28

The only reason I didn't rate it a &quot;5&quot; is that it has  SO MANY plot twists I, at times, felt I needed a score card to keep track  of all the events that occur.

If this is your first book by Deaver, The Empty  Chair will entice you to read his other books.

What if the President of the United States is unwilling to use the military to protect U.S. citizens, and defend the nation 's rights and ideals from attack? What if Congress used a hidden clause in the  Constitution to authorize military action without the President's approval?  That's the spectacular theme of Balance Of Power, the thrilling debut novel  from James W. Huston.<br />For me, Balance Of Power's unique blend of the  fascinating world of today's military technology with the intricacies of  high-octane politics and legal maneuvering, makes it a new kind of  intellectually-challenging, can't-put-it-down thriller. If you like  military/political/adventure thrillers, you won't want to miss this book!  It's like Tom Clancy and Stephen Coonts meet John Grisham on Patrick  O'Brian's high seas. Balance Of Power's only flaw, albeit a minor one, is  that it does not develop well enough the character of the bad guy, George  Washington.<br />Huston has the potential to be a new master in this genre. I  can't wait to read The Price Of Power,the sequel to Balance Of Power, to  see if Huston can deliver a solid &quot;one-two punch.&quot; Look over your  shoulders Clancy, Coonts and Grisham-- there's a new player in town!	2000-06-02

As you may or may not know, Cradle And All is a rework of Patterson's 2nd novel called Virgin. Most likely if you read Virgin within the past few years and remember the ending you probably won't want to read Cradle And  All -- even though there are differences between the two versions. But if  you haven't read Virgin or read it like I did(when it first came out in  1980)and don't remember the outcome, you're in for a real treat. After  reading an advance reader copy of Cradle And All, I'm sure that most  Patterson fans will find many of the qualities that have made them devour  his previous books. In typical Patterson fashion the plot moves along at a  break-neck pace, the chapters are very brief with each ending on a note  that makes you want to quickly turn the page, and the characters--while not  developed in great depth--are interesting. While I'm not a particularly  fast reader, I read this book in two days. Be prepared to be glued to your  favorite reading place until you finish Cradle And All!

Brokaw deserves credit for providing a major tribute to a generation that for too long has been underappreciated. Unfortunately, people in their late 70s and older are just seen -- particularly by Gen Xers and Gen Yers -- as  OLD; with most of us having little understanding of the sacrifices and  contributions they made towards making America what it is today. I agree  with Brokaw that the WWII generation may be the greatest generation in  America's history for the various reasons he cites in his book. As a book,  however,The Greatest Generation, while interesting, does not fulfill the  promise I was anticipating. Basically, what Brokaw has done is provide a  series of short, somewhat fluffy chronicles of the lives of WWII veterans  from various cross-sections of the United States. While these chronicles,  as I said, are interesting, they do not provide enough depth and insight  into how these individuals' wartime achievements contributed to what they  accomplished after the war. Nonetheless, The Greatest Generation is a book  worth reading for the main value it provides -- making each of the  post-WWII generations understand and appreciate better a generation which,  sadly, will not be with us for too much longer.	2000-05-16

Harr demonstrates a strong  ability to weave many interesting and little known facts about the  Revolutionary War, Benedict Arnold and many other historical figures into a  well-written and, at times, suspenseful work of fiction. Further, as some  other reviewers have noted, Dark Eagle is rich in visual imagery that makes  you feel you are right in the middle of the action. Dark Eagle  should find  a large audience among those who are fans of books about history, war and  even suspense.	2000-05-09

One element I was somewhat disappointed in was the  element of &quot;surprise,&quot; as I guessed a large part of the ending  about midway through the book. Also, a few story threads were not tied  together tightly enough for my satisfaction. Nonetheless, I enjoyed Steve  Hamilton's first book a lot and a think you will too.	2000-04-30

The Brethren is a perfect example of a book that becomes a megaseller just because of its author's mega reputation. While it moves along quickly (Thank God! ), The Brethren is weak in just about every quality you want in  a thriller -- plot, characterizations, suspense, surprises, credibility,  etc. This book is one more recent example of Grisham's spewing out books  without  caring enough about the quality on which he built his reputation.  Since he's become a dynasty in the publishing world, he seems to have  forgotten about the need to satisfy his readers. While it won't amount to a  &quot;spit in the ocean&quot; to Grisham, his future fortunes are going to  have to be made without any more contributions from me. This is likely to  be my last John Grisham book.	2000-04-13

Its plot is very fast-paced, the dialogue is crisp, the characters are well-developed, the humor is well-integrated within the non-stop suspense, and you'll be  guessing &quot;who-done-it&quot; right up until the end. Could you ask for  anything more in a mystery? This is definitely enough for me and I think  you'll be more than satisfied as well. If this will be your first Simon  Bolitar book by Coben, you're in for a treat. If you've read other Coben  books you KNOW you're in for a treat with Back Spin. Enjoy!	2000-03-28

Unfortunately, in Blackout his characters are so poorly developed and, in particular, his dialogue rings SO untrue that they completely outweigh the  suspense Nance tries to maintain throughout the book. Usually I am not that  critical of these factors as long as the plot is very strong. This is  definitely not the case in Blackout. As a matter of fact, because of these  factors I had to give up on this book with over 100 pages still to go. Save  yourself from this disaster and thrill yourself with another book! I'd  highly recommned Peter Blauner's Man Of The Hour.	2000-03-23

I was feeling that this is  the rare sequel that is better than the original. BUT... then came the  ending!  Or rather the lack of one that provided any sense of closure or  satisfaction. It seems that Mr. DemIlle just ran out of steam and decided  that rather than provide a &quot;real&quot; ending, he'll write yet another  sequel. While The Lion's Game is a book that is enjoyable, it could have  been so much better.	2000-03-17

I found the story started out with a lot of excitement but soon dragged -- and continued to do so for much too long a stretch. The last quarter generated excitement once again but by  that point I had pretty much stopped caring about the outcome. The greatest  thrill for me was coming to the final page so I could move on to my next  book. Shelby's writing style holds your interest, but this  &quot;thriller&quot;, while fairly fast-paced, turned out to be much too  predictable and, thus, not very thrilling. I was especially looking forward  to reading this book after reading some of the earlier reader reviews.  However, as you can see, my reading experience with Last Rights differed  from theirs. Now, if you're in the mood for a good thriller in the same  vein, try David Hackworth's The Price Of Honor.	2000-03-05

However, there really aren't very many surprises for a book almost 400  pages long and it ends with with some subplots being resolved too abruptly.  The suspense would have been more intense if The J Factor was 50-100 pages  shorter. Kanar is an author with a lot of potential, and I'm looking  forward to his next book. The J Factor is a book that is worth reading but  don't rush to put it at the top of your &quot;To Be Read&quot; list.	2000-02-24

Each time time Lehane writes a new book it is better than the ones that came before it -- and keep in mind his first book, A Drink Before The War was VERY GOOD. Prayers For Rain is a book that you won't be able to put  down once you start it. In typical Lehane fashion, the plot grabs your  attention from page one and never lets up; and the main characters, Patrick  and Angie, come across as so real you feel that you are one of their  friends (or at least would like to be one). And let's not forget Bubba --  and I don't mean Clinton. Bubba is definitely one of my favorite bad/good  guys in fiction, and is someone I'd want on my side if I was ever in major  trouble. In Prayers For Rain Lehane provides insights into Bubba's  character like never before. Don't miss this book!	2000-02-17

While I didn't enjoy Koontz's last two books and  his new book is not as good as Watchers, Dark Rivers Of The Heart and Intensity, he definitely has a big hit with False Memory.It's filled with very interesting characters  and the compelling plot holds your interest right from the beginning. But  beyond these vital elements, Koontz's main strength in my opinion in False  Memory is his ability to tap into the dark side of society and to  demonstate how his main characters prevail. Make sure that when you start  this book you've cleared your calendar of all things to do because you  won't want to put False Memory down.	2000-02-11

In Sheldon Shapiro's first novel, Special Circumstances, he deserves to be placed in the top-tier of legal thriller writers. Siegel has created well-developed characters -- particularly his protagonist, Mike Daley --  and the plot is fast-paced and bristles with energy. Siegel's ability to  combine excitement, surprises, humor and suspense makes Special  Circumstances a book that you won't want to put down. Without going into  detail for fear of providing information which might weaken some of the  story's suspense for you, the only thing that kept me from rating this book  a '5' is that I felt slightly--and I emphasize 'slightly'-- disappointed in  the ending. Nevertheless, Special Circumstances is a book I know you'll  enjoy and will want to recommend to your friends.	2000-02-02

Actually, I would have rated this book &quot;3 1/2&quot; stars if Amazon allowed for such a rating. His debut novel  provides a good writing style, a well-developed plot and a variety of  surprises. However, I found the story dragged on for some long stretches  which, at times, caused my interest level to wane. Further, while he spent  sufficient time developing the major and minor characters, I found myself  not caring as much about them as the author would have wanted me to. Also,  I felt that Fergusson tried to weave too many elements into the story which  I, at times, found to be confusing and which he never completely tied  together at the end. Perhaps he's left the door opened for a sequel.  Despite these minor criticisms The Piper's Sons is worth reading and  Fergusson is an author with a lot of potential.	2000-01-17

Lehane describes  these characters in such realistic detail and uses such crisp dialogue that  you forget that they are only fictional characters. Nonetheless, they are  characters you want to get to know better, and Lehane successfully evolves  the personalities of Patrick and Angie in each of the five books in the  series. Thus, it's best if you read the series in chronological order.  Sacred is very fast-paced and loaded with surprising plot twists, which  forces you to read on non-stop. While you can see I am very high on Sacred,  it -- believe it or not -- is not the best book in the series. Of the four  I've read so far, I enjoyed Darkness, Take My Hand and Gone, Baby Gone even  more. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to all of Lehane's books.	2000-01-08

The latest in  an eight-generation line of Caine men to serve Duty, Honor, Country,  Sandy's character has been hammered out on an almost flawless anvil of  military tradition.

And ever since his Spartan childhood, Sandy can't help  brooding about it.

However,in comparing Void Moon to Connelly's other non-Bosch thrillers-- The Poet and Blood Works--Void Moon is not as good.  Comparatively, it does not measure up on the extent of surprises,  believability, and depth of character development (although Cassie Black  and Jack Karch ARE interesting characters). If Void Moon is your first book  by Connelly you might give it a higher rating than the '3' I gave it (which  I actually would have rated a '3 1/2' if Amazon had such a rating), but  it's hard for me to evaluate this book without comparing it to The Poet and  Blood Works, which I would highly recommend. Keep in mind, that a '3' (or a  '3 1/2') is a good rating and, as I said, Void Moon is worth reading.	1999-12-12

I found that while the plot had many twists, most were predictable. Further,  the relationships between the key characters were also able to be predicted  well in advance. Nonetheless, Martel tells a story that will make you want  to read on and has developed characters that you will care about. Actually,  while I rated The Alternate a '3', it really deserves a '3 1/2'.	1999-12-07

Embedded within Personal Injuries is what could have been an interesting plot. HOWEVER, Turow feels it necessary to describe in excrutiating detail every thought, every feeling, every rationale for these thoughts and  feelings of every major and minor character in this book. As a consequence,  I feel that I, personally, have suffered a personal injury trying to force  myself to read Turow's latest effort. Finally, after making myself read  about 1/3 of the book, my disgust with Personal Injuries won out and I gave  up on it. It's possible that people who read books mainly for in-depth  characterizations versus plot will enjoy this book. But,for me, the  following saying was the basis for my decision to not waste any more time  reading this book, 'so many books, so liitle time.'	1999-09-30

Redmond's first effort moves along quickly and generally holds your  attention. However, there is little depth to the characters, and there is  little suspense because you'll be able to guess what happens well before it  actually occurs.

It has many of the elements loved by lovers of serial killer thrillers -- fast-pacing, murders and gore galore and lots of  plot twists. However, my main fault with this book is that Connelly failed  to develop his main character and key supporting characters well enough for  me to feel that I really knew them and, as a result, I never cared enough  about what happened to them.

After Patterson's last disaster, When The Wind Blows,he has redeemed himself with his newest book, Pop Goes The Weasel. This story is very exciting but light in terms of character develoment, narrative style and  basically most other literary elements which make for a well-written novel.  However, these are not elements I, and I think many other readers', seek in  a James Patterson book.With this said, I think you will enjoy Pop Goes The  Weasel very much and find it a very, very fast read. The one minor flaw  that I've found in this and other Alex Cross books is the totally  unrealistic maturity level and dialogue voiced by Cross's seven year old  daughter, Jannie. I'd suggest that in doing research for future books,  Patterson should spend a little time finding out what real seven year olds  are like.	1999-07-06

Both of which read like thrillers but are really great,  adrenaline-pumping fiction. Consistent with these past successes, Blauner's  latest, Man Of Honor, is another must-read and may be his best yet. If you  like exciting well-written stories with well-developed and memorable  characters--and who doesn't?-- rush out and buy Man Of Honor when it comes  out in April. While you're at it, do yourself a favor and pick up copies of  Slow Motion Riot and The Intruder as well	1999-03-04

In Reckless Homicide, first-time novelist, Ira Genberg, has written a legal thriller that is at least as good as--and possibly better than--the best of Grisham, Turow, J.F. Freedman, et al. The plot never wanes in its  excitement, the characters are very interesting and well-developed, the  dialog rings true, and surprises pop up throughout the story.

While Preston definitely is familiar with all the details about biological warfare, he has virtually no  ability to develop and sustain a plot and in creating rich, interesting  characters. All of his characters are cardboard-like figures. The publisher  would have been more honest in marketing this book as a scientific  documentary on biological warfare than as a suspense thriller. Save  yourself the time and possible expense and skip The Cobra Event.	1999-01-26

The story builds to a point where where you expect really a memorable ending. While the conclusion is satisfying, the author  allows it to end much too quickly.

I have read every book by James Patterson has written and felt that they  were all readable. I consider his Alex Cross books to be excellent. His  latest, however,When The Wind Blows, is not only HIS worst book, it is one  of the worst books I've read in many years. This book has no redeeming  qualities--the writing style is amateurish, the characters are plastic and,  worst of all, the dialogue is awful. Do yourself a favor and read ANYTHING  else but When The Wind Blows.	1998-10-02

While  well-written, the plot is mostly  predictable and mechanical. Unlike most other books by R.N. Patterson there  are no major surprises. No Safe Place would be okay to take from the  library but save your money to buy another book.	1998-09-18

The main characters are mostly likable but could have been more fully developed. Nonetheless, High Crimes is well worth reading! Further, if this is your first book by Finder, you might also want to read The Moscow Club and Extraordinary Powers. His third book, The Zero Hour, was not as good.	1998-08-07

The Mark Of The Assassin (originally to be titled The Society) is an exciting, fast-moving thriller that is well-worth reading. It has it all...interesting characters, good plot and sub-plots, lots of action and some good surprises.  Silva can expect another bestseller when this book goes on-sale in March (possibly April); however, it is not without some minor flaws, such as occasional weak dialogue and a few secondary characters which could have been developed more. I think you'll be able to easily  overlook these flaws.<br /><br />The Mark Of The Assassin is a very good second effort by Silva, but it is not as good as his previous thriller, The Unlikely Spy (which is now out in paperback).

Gray did  manage to recapture some of my attention and interest in the final quarter of the book but by this point I was as much interested in finishing it so I could move on to my next book as in finding out how the story ends.

Buffa has written a fast-moving, fairly entertaining story that generally  holds your interest. The ending, however, is very predictable and one that you are likely to guess about 2/3s of the way through the book. Also, Buffa needs to improve his pacing in terms of providing for the passage of time. In several instances he allows years to go by without sufficient set-up for the reader.  My suggestion is that if you have an interest in reading The Defense, get it from the library or borrow it from a friend; do not pay $20 for it!	1998-01-19
