John Gordon's history is a good introduction to economics and its influence in America since 1776.  Recommended as a start for a novice interested in the US's achievements and success that has generated it current tremendous economic power. <br /> <br />My only negative opinion is this:  the book, as other reviewers here have allude to, glosses over and even completely dismisses critical events in US economic history.  One striking example of this is Henry Poor, whose company today is one of the three major credit ratings agencies in the world (Standard & Poor's).  Nonetheless, Poor began his career in mid-19th century as one of the pioneer financial analysts providing research information concerning the emerging railroad industry.  Without his efforts, the lack of transparency of a railroad company's financial progress would have severely dampened enthusiasm and reduced the number of actual investments that were made during that period.	2005-09-15

First, the questions are much longer than the real exam, attempting to provide the reader with the intellectual underpinnings of the project manager's role.  Second, it provides many scenario-based questions that apply enormously with the actual exam. <br /> <br />I've read and heard many reviews that this study guide is far off the mark when it comes to the actual exam.  For me, it provided a good way to think about the questions without jumping to the supposed right answer just to pass the exam.  Project management success is heavily based on experience--the more and varied it is, the better chance of success you will have.  Like management theorist Kurt Lewin stated:  \\"There is nothing so practical as a good theory.\\"	2005-04-08

War was the basic element of Nazism.  Not just for territorial conquest, but of racial superiority and annihilation.  For example, the WW2 was lost as early as 1942 (right after Stalingrad), but the regime wasn't prepared to refocus strategy since its only stragegy was waging war endlessly.  Germany suffered the majority of war casualities in the last 2 years (1944-1945) which were also its most brutal. <br /> <br />2.  Majority of Germans believed they were victims in the post war world.  The German Army, the Wehrmacht, underwent a period of revisionist history in that it was not a advocate of the racial war.  Only in the mid 1990s did Germany feel comfortable discussing the army's role in the war. <br /> <br />3.  Nazism's collapse was total (unlike Baathism and its insurgency in post-war Iraq 2004).  Allies destruction of German forces in 1945 and the Nuremburg trials (where high level Nazis were hanged) removed any advantage Nazism once held by its believers. <br /> <br />This book has almost 220 full pages of text.  The remaining 20 pages or so are for notes and bibliography.	2005-02-07

I was an avid fan of Harvard Business School Press (HBSP), and their brand of management summaries and knowledge. However, over the years, I've become disillusioned with the HBSP editoral style and model of publishing management/general business books. <br /> <br />Funny how many of their titles are written by Harvard Business School professors. Basically, the professors -- Olympian guardians of all management ideas and \\"know-how\\" -- are writing books telling practicing managers (middle to senior level) how to maximize their leadership styles and their corporate profits.  <br /> <br />Anyhow, I believe that HBSP has recently released a rather improved book, \\"A Bias for Action,\\" written by Heike Bruch and Sumantra Ghoshal. It strives to explain the idea that effective managers aren't necessarily busy managers. Busy managers being those who find comfort in just being active, without a vision or long-term goal for their group or team. It asks the question: what can we do as a managerial class to become more effective and focused? <br /> <br />What really shines through (and caught my attention) is the book's underlying theme that willpower is a major force for success. Willpower, to the authors, is a combination of energy and focus. There are several traps/pitfalls that are outlined:&lt;ul>&lt;li>Trap of overwhelming demands <br />&lt;li>Trap of unbearable constraints <br />&lt;li>Trap of unexplored choices <br />&lt;/ul>What I've found most favorable is the authors' strategy of finding a goal and protecting your intentions. Inevitable setbacks will occur. Great managers and leaders know how to deflect that and concentrate on the positive energy by thinking about past successes, envisioning the goal, controlling your confidence, or talking with a mentor. <br /> <br />The latter half of the book deals with CEO-level management and how they can program their organizations to exhibit the environment that enable managers to become \\"purpose-driven.\\"   Depending on your rolein the organization, this half may not be too useful.	2004-11-15

Cicero is displayed in all his greatness and timidity (especially his well-known fear of physical harm).  It's remarkable how much Cicero wrote about his life and times.  Besides completing his political and philosophical books, Cicero found - it seems - an enormous amount of time to write personal letters to friends.  The majority of the facts around this time in Roman history is transmitted through Cicero.  <br />This history is highly recommended for the beginner and intermediate Roman history buff.  Many of that time period's famous historical figures, incluing Caesar and Antony, are vividly brought to life.	2004-02-03

This book is a good introduction to the internal organizational politics that occurs.  I believe the author has used several themes to highlight the story of how Microsoft created the Xbox.<br />1. Innovation.  This is always a topic for business stories.  The book does an excellent job on describing the (almost) day to day activities that an internal, subversive group within Microsoft that hatched the idea for a game console.<br />2. Corporate culture.  Microsoft has been accused of having a insular culture that prohibits risk-taking activities.  I think in the Windows Operating System group this might be true.  But Microsoft's game console strategy was one of new entrant.  Sony, Sega, and Nintendo were the heavyweights.  It was interesting to read how Microsoft approached the market by listening to game developers and gamers needs.  They outlined a strategy that highlighted several competitive elements that the other, more entrench firms ignored.<br />3. Overview  of Game Culture.  The author is a well-known journalist that has been covering the game industry for years. There are some great insights on the industry's perks and unique charactistics.  The Japanese game culture is much more highly developed vs. the American.  The demographics are very selected in the US -- 18 to 26 males.  Microsoft, as part of its initial console strategy, aimed to enlarge this demographic to include woman and older men.<br />Yet I have several misgivings about this book.<br />1. There aren't any reproduced internal memos, white papers, or notes that made up the effort to create the console.  We are only shown photos of Microsoft employees.  It would have been nice to see actual artifacts.<br />2. The reading sometimes is too easy.  The author, of course, is a journalist.  It is by far an unscholarly text.	2004-01-01

Peter came to the Russian throne at a time that most Europe was entering the Industrial Revolution and peeling the fruits of the Renaissance.  Russia needed to quickly come up-to-speed in its culture and military.  The book focuses on Peter's strategy to do this:  build Russia's first navy, update military tactics, and update Russia's culture while lessing the dependence on the Russian Orthodox Church.<br />The book also delves into the details of Peter's personal life, his various illness, and his clemency to his subjects (especially those military commanders that suffered defeats).  He was a born leader, knowing when to drive out fear, and when to force change for the benefit of the Russian State.  <br />Massey wrote the perfect history for Peter and 18th century Russia.	2003-07-14

I was interested in the specific leadership abilities these \\"supreme commanders\\" portrayed.  Not only does the author provide a concise review of the leader's life and times, he expands the discussion to include the successes and failures of a leader's attributes.  All four of the leaders are accussed of micromanaging their generals-who in turn complained loudly (even to the press) and came dangerously close to insubordination.   <br />The book's primary theme is that political leaders must control their military counterparts.  Through such leadership actions as asking tough questions, being widely read with a large common sense, constantly learning military details, courageously dealing with ambiguity within the larger context of human suffering (war), and leading a team with powerful egos (the generals) to a political solution.<br />The US's Gulf War in 1991 is particulary relevant (and recent) as an illustration of the \\"normal\\" concept of civil-military relations since Vietnam.  That is, political goals and military strategy are highly evolved professions and distinct from each other.  One group should not infringe on the other's playing field.  The book's theme remains controversial as it spotlights wartime leadership qualities.	2003-01-04

I approached this book on a travel writing level where you would read Lawrense Durrell and Henry Miller books about Greece.  I did experience this in addition to a great story about finding (and losing) your life-long dreams.  <br />As recorded in the brief summary above, the book follows the author's adventure one summer trying to run a Greek taverna on the Agean island of Patmos.  The book recounts how the author set up shop, ran it daily with his dubious Greek partner, and finally discovered what his dream really meant to him.  The narrative seems to take place before Patmos become a hot tourist location (before 1990), yet Tom Stone doesn't reveal any dates.  The author's page revelas that Tom no longer lives in Greece, but in Southern California.<br />The book is light reading (probably take 2 hours of reading...after all it is only 199 pages) -- it includes with some folklore about the island (much revolving around St. John's visit in the first century).  The recipies printed in the appendix are a nice touch, especially for those wanting to indulge in the culinary experience.	2002-08-05

(The book, by the way, is dedicated to Lawrence Durrell - the author of the Alexandria Quartet.)<br />The book is divided in to 5 sections: <br />1. The Birth of the City<BR>2. The Mind of the City<BR>3. The Power of the City<BR>4. The Soul of the City<BR>5. The Death of the City<br />The first two chapters are very good.  They outline the philosophers and cultural aspects that thrived in Alexandria from ancient to Byzantine times.  However, the book is centered around the 3rd chapter, which is a lenghty retelling of the Roman invasion, Cleopatra's effort to successfully incorporate Egypt into the Empire with Caesar, and her eventually fall with Antony.  <br />More could have been written about the city's finances and politics.  The philosophical discussion is basic -- it doesn't go into much detail regarding the Alexandrian philosophers' teachings. <br />Altogether, this Alexandrian history is valuable as there is very little else out there (besides Cavafy's Alexandria-myth poetry and Durrell's love themes) that cloud the real, important history of the city.	2002-02-17

As I reached the midsection, I realized that the book combined travel aspects (Byzantine architecture, battles, etc.) with the harrowing stories of religious persecution told by a myriad group of monks, priest, innocent bystanders, and various historical writings.  <br />Dalrymple weaves a talented tale of how modern countries in the Near &amp; Middle East are coping with their Christian legacy.  It even shocked me when I read how &quot;modern Islam has kept several of the long-lost traditions of Christianity.&quot;  Another remark sparked the same interest: &quot;How Christianity is a product of the Eastern world, but has significantly lost connection with its birthplace.&quot;  A truely great book!	2001-12-17

She's the Heroine of the novel that experiences what most of us do not see...family oblieration and identity upheavel.<br />This novel works on different levels.  For one, the Turkish government continues to suppress its brutal heritage spawned in the early 20th century.  Blame aside, this history has not been adequately told to the world, and a book such as &quot;Not Even My Name&quot; shouts it loudly and from a tragically personal level.  Another level is the author's progression towards realizing what her mother (and the family) went through and how it bears on the descendants.	2001-06-13

As a Greek-American reading about Greece in Miller's account written in the 1930's, I found it to be very moving.  It isn't simply a travel book about Greece, it's about Greece healing someone's soul!<br />I absolutely love  Miller's, &quot;Tropic of Cancer,&quot; and was expecting the same style  for Maroussi.  However, I was mistaken.  Miller doesn't include any of his  notorious womanizing stories here.  Instead, Miller writes about finding  peace in contemplating Greece, modern and ancient.  Again, his written  prose is like reading poetry.  There are some passages from this book that  I had to &quot;cut out&quot; and keep for inspiration.  <br />I highly  recommend this book to anyone interested in Henry Miller or Greece.  I must  also recommend Edmund Keeley's, &quot;Inventing Paradise,&quot; which is  something of a companion to Maroussi.  In it, Keeley discusses Miller's  Greek journey, which he took along with George Seferis, Lawrence Durrell,  and other 20th century Greek poets, writers, and painters.	2000-02-08

However, after reading this book,  I come to respect Venice's history as a lonely light that shined in Europe  through most of the &quot;Middle Ages.&quot;  One interesting fact was the  the Republic lived almost 1,000 years and was finally destroyed (or, as  Norwich said, &quot;humiliated&quot;) by Napoleon.<br />As for the author,  Norwich is an excellent writer and brings life to the Republic's once  glorious past.	1999-12-18

In a related note, Sir Steven Runciman has written a respectable history of the Church during its occupation by the Ottoman Turks.<br />Meyendorff has written a very  detailed and extraordinary book that spans the entire life of the Eastern  Orthodox Church.  For example, he writes how the various translations of  the New Testament have lead the Roman Catholics and Orthodox believers to  divide on dogma.	1999-12-07

We read about Miller's &quot;down and out&quot; days in 1930s Paris.  He writes excellent prose and has been a major influence on  writers.	1999-09-21

As a grad student, I found this book to be an excellent one regarding strategic management.  I first read the HBR article on &quot;core competencies&quot; and found the concept very intriguing.  The book  pre-dates the online markets, but the issues discussed are still very  relevant.  It's interesting to compare the book's theories with what  AT&amp;T is currently doing in the cable arena.	1999-05-19
