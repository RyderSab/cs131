The poverty of the Longchamp family is poignantly and well described and it's touching that Dawn and Jimmy have a close bond between them as siblings. Jimmy is rather sweet, despite his quick temper and difficulty dealing with the rich, spoiled kids in their new private school that they are attending only due to their dad getting a maintenence job with the school.<br /><br />Everything changes for the worse when Ormand is arrested and it's revealed that Dawn actually is biologically part of another family...the rich, snobby Cutlers with priggish, spiteful, jealous Clara Sue and phony Philip who tried to charm his way with Dawn and mocked poor Jimmy behind his back while smiling to his face.  The couple who all themselves Dawn's \\"parents\\" are really not parents at all in the way Sally Jean and Ormand Longchamp were...Laura Sue is another phony who spends her time upstairs pretending to be sick whenever anyone brings up anything she doesn't want to hear (I laughed and mentally imagined the \\"medicines\\" she was claiming to be on were actually jelly beans or milk duds) and irresponsible dependent Randolph Cutler who repeatedly makes excuses for the others' shabby treatment of Dawn.  Randolph especially makes excuses for his lousy mother, Lillian Cutler, the biggest snob of all.  Lillian, who calls herself Dawn's grandmother, treats Dawn with open contempt and gives Dawn one of the worst jobs in \\"her\\" hotel as chambermaid while she gives Clara Sue and Philip cleaner jobs.<br /><br />Jimmy, who has his load of problems in the foster home he's sent to, runs away and finds where Dawn is and offers his shoulder to lean on, despite the fact that he was abused in the foster home and is dealing with his own trauma from that as well as still grieving for his lost mother, whom he loved very much.<br /><br />I really liked Jimmy because even though he tried to hide his vulnerability under a mask of fiery bravado and his fiesty temper, he really was soft and sensitive inside and it's clearly seen when he weeps over Sally Jean's tragic death, then cries over being seperated from Dawn.  I was sooo glad when I read that later on, Jimmy gets in a better foster home.<br /><br />Dawn later finds out why the grandmother is such a heel and why she seems to resent Dawn from an unexpected source.  Dawn confronts her grandmother with it; that part was great since then her grandmother was confronted with her wrongdoings and had no choice but to send Dawn to the school of her dreams...learning about music, Dawn's lifelong passion.<br /><br />Dawn finds out more about Laura Sue and Randolph in this spellbinding story and also finds out what the entire story is behind the terrible accusations against Ormand and Sally Jean Longchamp.

Poor, poor Harry's really having a hard time.  He's been badly traumatized by Cedric's death and by his latest confrontations with Voldemort and he hurts deeply inside, but his reserve and fear prevent him from getting it out. Few know how Harry secretly weeps at night and about the terrible nightmares he's being plagued with and his silent anguish and fear during the day.<br /><br />The Senior Ministry is playing cruel mind games with the Hogwarts students and teachers.  Dumbledore himself has been pressured to conceal something important from Harry; will Dumbledore be able to get by the Senior Ministry's manipulations to reveal what Harry needs to know before it's too late?<br /><br />To complicate matters more, Harry is going thru puberty and has his first romantic fling.  He's also beginning to realize how sensitive he is and discovers that bullying and others' suffering bother him much more than the average person.<br /><br />Percy, Ron's older brother, is becoming colder and turns on the rest of the Weasley family and Harry in a cruel way and indirectly threatens Harry in a condescending letter to Ron. It becomes clear that Percy could really hurt Harry and in the process hurt Ron too.<br /><br />Immature, spoiled Draco Malfoy becomes worse in this book, bullying Harry and Ron and robbing Harry of his enjoyment of Quidditch.<br /><br />Enter a sadistic new DADA teacher who takes pleasure in tyrannizing the students.  When Harry tries to stand up to her, she punishes Harry in a very cruel, humiliating way that adds to his trauma.<br /><br />In addition, Harry discovers something awful about his late dad that is very painful and could change the way he feels about James Potter forever.<br /><br />As a result of all this, Harry is more fearful, anxious, irritable, and sad and appears to be suffering from clinical depression complicated by post-traumatic stress syndrome.  His appetite is poor; small things are upsetting him more; his ironic sense of humor seems to have faded; he cries more easily; he's not as resilient as he was in the first four books, and he seems sad, joyless, angry, and much more anxious and fearful in this book.  My heart really went out to him in this book.<br /><br />One underlying theme which was illustrated beautifully is Harry's deepening compassion and empathy and his strong character.  Despite his depression and a painful loss of someone close to him, Harry continues to stand by his classmates when Malfoy and Umbridge and the Senior Ministry bully them; most of what Harry is upset about are not just his own problems, but others' pain and suffering.<br /><br />I loved how Harry stood up for Ron when Ron was driven to tears on the Quidditch field by harrassment; Harry's inner beauty shone thru another time when he was in pain over losing someone he loved very much, yet he was worried about Luna Lovegood when she was looking for her things and feared that she might have been harrassed.  Bravo, Harry...bravo!  I think the depression and pain will be Harry's biggest battle, even bigger than his battle with Voldemort or any other battle he's ever fought and so far he's held on admirably thru it all like a Gryffindor trooper.<br /><br />Another lovely underlying theme of this book is the loyalty of friends.  While Harry is going thru all his pain and heartache, his friends Ron, Hermione, and Ginny stick by him and in addition, Harry makes two new friends, Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood.  So it is no longer exclusively just the \\"trio\\" anymore; they are now a sixsome.  It's really beautiful the way the six of them stick by each other thru thick and thin.  Since Harry has been loyal and a very good friend to the five of them; he's always been there when they need him; it is coming back in spades now and esp. at the end, when Malfoy threatens Harry and Harry has lost his loved one and is grieving, it is apparent that these five friends are reciprocating and are now standing by Harry when he needs their support. I suspect these six individuals will each play a crucial role in defeating Voldemort and the death eaters in the last two upcoming books.Harry when he needs their support.

Poor Charlie is painfully shy, ultra-sensitive and is frightened when he's the center of attention.  He even finds it hard to enjoy his own birthday party, much to his classmates' amusement. He knows he's different from most other boys, but doesn't know what to do about it.<br />Ramsey happens along and is really a talking dog...he talks a LOT.  I laughed out loud at Ramsey's funny comments, esp. since I get the feeling he wasn't too crazy about Charles' rather outgoing, overbearing dad.  Charlie's sociable, boisterous dad can't understand why his quiet son is so fearful &amp; timid and along with his mom, wheedles Charlie into entering a dog show with Ramsey.  Ramsey's excited about it, but poor Charlie's nerves are completely on edge.  The book was very good at describing Charlie's many fears and how he got through the week before the fair in a haze of fear.<br />Even though I am not shy myself, I feel for people who are.  My heart went out to Charlie as he dreaded the performance and had a flashback to a painful memory of another performance where he blundered and everyone had laughed at him.<br />Socially, I got the feeling that Charlie also had a rough time, since quiet sensitivity in those days (and sometimes today) isn't valued in boy children.  Charlie even had difficulty dealing with store clerks and crabby Mr. Crisp doesn't make it any easier for Charlie to get a much-needed collar for his dog.<br />It was touching to see how Ramsey encouraged Charlie to deal with his shyness and to try new things, despite being so fearful.  Although Charlie will probably always be shy &amp; sensitive, Ramsey made it easier for him to deal with and changed his life for the better.	2003-11-15

I read this book in 2nd or 3rd grade & re-read it just last week The years haven't washed this wonderful little book of its magic.  After falling off the broom of a resentful old witch who secretly wishes she could have a cat instead, Spook lands on top of little Jamie, who falls into a rain barrel while bobbing for apples with his older brother and two older sisters on Halloween night.  John, Jamie's bossy brother announces that poor Jamie is \\"too young for Halloween\\" which dissolves Jamie into tears.  Spook follows the kids into the kitchen where their mom washes and puts a nightgown on Jamie, then they feed Spook, who then becomes very attached to Jamie.<br />It's a story of love & Spook's longing to be in a warm caring home & little weak Jamie's desire to be able to do the same things as his older siblings.  I rather liked little Jamie & felt kind of sorry for him when his siblings went to the Halloween party without him.  I also get the feeling that his older brother teased him a lot.<br />I thought it was neat that Jamie grew to love Spook so much that he risked his own life to ride on mischievous Grimalda's broomstick and over to the witch coven at the hillside cave.  I suspect Jamie was a bit frightened of the large, imposing Head Witch, but it turns out that the Head Witch is a fair judge, is not really a bad witch & I think she was impressed by Jamie's supernatural power to turn Spook back into a normal dog after Grimalda hexes Spook into a caterpillar.  I think by the end of the contest, the Head Witch rather liked little Jamie & saw that Jamie had a rather big heart & kind soul.  I wonder if Jamie's a wizard, but doesn't know it?<br />It's so touching how sweet Jamie loved Spook so much and there were several funny parts like the witches (all old crones, the kind you'd mostly find in Knockturn Alley of Potterverse) cackling and fussing to each other and Grimalda's frightening poor Jamie at the Halloween party and the rather amusing, yet touching part where Spook, in the guise of a leaf accidentally lands in the Head Witch's lap and Jamie's so nervous, being still a bit frightened of the Head Witch, that he swallows as he tries to touch the leaf.<br />The ending is truly a scene of pure magic as Halloween ends and November begins.  I think after that fateful Halloween, Jamie's siblings will have a new respect for their little brother and Spook goes thru a transformation himself.  It's one of the most memorable childhood books that I've read.re Spook, in the guise of a leaf accidentally lands in the Head Witch's lap and Jamie's so nervous, being still a bit frightened of the Head Witch, that he swallows as he tries to touch the leaf.<br />The ending is truly a scene of pure magic as Halloween ends and November begins.

He gets more and more enchanting the more I read about him.  This book is even better than the first two esp. since Hogwarts is on high alert and on the lookout for an escaped convict.  Allegedly, rumors are flying that he's after Harry, which makes Harry really nervous.  Also there is a wonderful scene at the Leaky Cauldron where he stays with the Weasleys.  Readers can see that Molly Weasley esp. is forming a deep attachment to Harry and really loves him like another son.  I get the feeling she feels protective of Harry.  To make Harry's 13th year and 3rd year at Hogwarts even more complicated, dementors are guarding the school and pay a visit to the Hogwarts Express.  Poor Harry faints at the sight of these ugly, draining creatures.  Later, he has frightening flashbacks of his parents' senseless deaths in the dementors prescence, since dementors cast dark thoughts on their victims.  Harry even has an unfortunate encounter with a dementor on the Quidditch field and that causes him to lose his first game.  I liked how Oliver Wood and the other Gryffindor players conforted him and stood by him, even though they were disappointed at losing the game.  Then that mean, horrid Malfoy is nastier than ever and makes fun of Harry's fear of the dementors very cruelly and mimicks his fainting and his falling off his broom.  I was sooo glad when Hermione finally got fed up and slugged Malfoy!  Harry's fortunate to have someone as caring as Remus Lupin come onto the staff and try to help Harry overcome his fear.  My favorite scene in the book is when Harry's at one session with Lupin and has a particturaly awful flashback of his folks' death and end up in tears.  Poor Harry's embarrassed about his weeping and tries to hide them by pretending to tie his shoe; it was a touching, yet funny scene!  I think Lupin saw his tears, but was too kind to say anything and embarrass Harry even more.  In this book, readers can see how sensitive Harry really is, esp. since he's the one most affected by the dementors.  Harry, though, is very embarrassed about his sensitivity and tries to don on a front of bravado, but doesn't always succeed.<br />The scenes with the new divination professor are funny too; Hermione gets fed up with her and ends up dropping her class.  I like that Hermione is developed more in this book too; I can see she and McGonagall have a lot in common and have a real rapport.  It's also great that more female characters are added, including Sybll Trelawny and Cho Chang.  I also love how contemporary the books and most of the characters are; for Harry and his crowd, the ABSCENCE of girls on the Quidditch team is an unusual sight...in past and more stereotypical books, the PRESENCE of girls was considered unusual.  It's so refreshing to see a young boy with enlightened, feminist views of girls and women; Harry never thinks of females as \\"other\\" or \\"different.\\"  I've just started the book 4 and I get the feeling that will be the best book of this bunch, esp. since Harry is edging into puberty by book 4.

Bravo, JK and Harry!  Wow, Harry puts up with so much from the Dursleys; it was a great, funny getaway.  I laughed also when Harry's first trip by floo powder results in him coughing, and winding up in the Dark Arts section of Diagon Alley, totally embarrassed.  Boy, I could see that Harry was soo scared when he sees Lucius Malfoy, who's even worse than that awful Draco Malfoy.  It was kind of funny that Harry hid in a closet, too afraid to let them see him, esp. since Harry was a mess and his glasses were broken.  Malfoy gets worse in this book and torments poor Harry even more, esp. during their first Quidditch game when Harry's trying to avoid a bludger.  I was soo glad when Malfoy missed the snitch and caused Slytherin to lose because he was too busy taunting Harry and wound up getting blasted big-time by the Slytherin Captain! Malfoy deserved that one; he's a rotten snob. Dobby is funny and cute and it's sweet that Harry frees him from the Malfoy's control even though Dobby causes a lot of trouble for Harry. I could tell poor Dobby was miserable with the Malfoys and I get the feeling that the Malfoys treated him like dirt.  I also laughed and my heart kind of went out to Harry when Colin Creavey is gushing over him and taking pictures of him and basically annoys Harry.  Harry tries hard to be patient with Colin, but it isn't easy.  Ginny finally works her way into this plot, but she's still a rather marginal character.  Hopefully, she'll be more into the future books and movies.  It's great that she and Hermione become friends.  It's also great that female characters stay strong here and there's a new female professor, Sprout, who teaches Herbology.  I'm now reading the third book and hope to get to book 4 soon, but I'm glad I've read the first two; they're a great read!  I'm also looking forward to the release of the second movie!	2002-11-09

Four \\"problem\\" kids are put into Torey's class because no one knows how to handle them.  I love how Torey takes each of them to heart, even when they're being difficult.  I kind of laughed, yet sympathized with Torey when Tomaso first arrives, full of anger and swear words and he challenges Torey with \\"what are you some kind of *&%# crazy teacher\\" when Torey stays calm and doesn't let Tomaso make her mad.  I could tell Tomaso was used to having adults yell at him or hit him.  I could also tell this book took place around the 1970's before many people were aware of learning disabilities, because no one knows why Lori is having so much trouble with reading and spelling, yet she is very bright.  I do hope Lori has now learned to read; so many kids back then never learned because of inadequate resources to help them. I get the feeling Lori had dyslexia, a common byproduct of brain damage. Boy, was I disgusted with Edna Thorsen's attitude toward both Lori and Torey; she really had no right to barge into Torey's classroom and demand that Torey account for how she was teaching Lori.  I could tell poor Torey was really upset by a lot of Edna's behavior and Edna's attitudes smacked of the Nazi belief in \\"survival of the fittest\\" as an excuse for exterminated their handicapped.  I liked that Torey was caring enough to go over to Lori's house when Lori refused to come to school for a week and talk her into coming back.  My heart went out to Torey because she blamed herself for that incident and feels so guilty at one point that she swallows when she's talking to Lori.  Torey was swell in that she struggled to find professional help for Claudia, who was suffering from depression and pregnant at twelve.  I like how Torey is honest in her own feelings and lets herself feel vulnerable.  She's not afraid to cry in front of her students sometimes and the most touching scene is when she's playing a guitar and singing along with her students near the end of the year and she unexpectedly starts crying mid-song.  It was kind of funny and touching when Lori asks her, \\"How come you're crying, Tor?\\"  At first, Torey tries to fight the tears, but she can't and admits that she's feeling a bit emotional, esp. since she worries about their futures.  All in all, a touching, wonderful read to anyone who's ever dealt with kids or handicapped people.  Way to go, Torey!!!of the year and she unexpectedly starts crying mid-song.

I laughed out loud and sympathized with the Hatchers when their relatives invite themselves over to their apartment and camp out there for several weeks.  The twins, the \\"Natural Beauties\\" were cute and funny, even though Peter's embarrassed by them.  I kind of felt a little sorry for the twins because their dad, Howie struck me as rather backward and to add to it, they're home-schooled (personally I think one of the worst ideas in education along with the look-say method of reading).  All in all, the books was heart-warming and hilarious!	2002-10-12

I actually read the book AFTER I'd seen the movie and the book of course adds much more detail (there's only so much you can squash into a two-hour movie).  The book is a wonderful read for kids and adults alike.  Harry is a loveable, loving, endearing character and I like how sweet and polite he is.  I loved the scene where at the zoo; parts of it was funny.  It was touching, though, how Harry had empathy for the poor snake and it was cute how he says softly, \\"It's annoying, I know, having stupid people banging...\\" (Dudley & Vernon pound on the glass of the cage and in the movie, Harry gets sick of it and tells them, \\"He's asleep!\\")  The Dursleys reminded me of many narrow-minded, judgemental people I've encountered in the world, including people who feel threatened by those who are \\"different\\" (Harry's awful aunt and uncle call him \\"strange and abnormal\\" in a very cruel way right to his face).  J.K. did a wonderful job creating little Harry, right down to the glasses and thick, dark, rather unkempt hair.  Apparently the reviewer who said didn't like Harry and claimed that he \\"became self-centered and unwilling to follow rules and expects Dumbledore to save his butt\\" and \\"treated rivals badly\\" didn't get the depth of Harry's character.  Harry is the LEAST self-centered character I've ever read about; the only rules he breaks is maybe being out of bed at night (a rule not really strictly enforced at Hogwarts)  The times Harry does get into trouble (most kids do from time to time, he accepts the consequences willingly, even if it means serving detention with Malfoy for a weekend.  Harry NEVER mistreats his rivals; he just refuses to butter Malfoy up.  Harry's reasons for sneaking out of bed at night reflects his deep caring for his fellow students and for the future of Hogwarts; it's not just idle curiosity that he's creeping around the restricted section of the library at night (in the movie, he's so frightened he swallows when he almost runs into Snape and Filch).  The ending was sooo sweet and touching when he's recovering from his confrontation with Voldemort and Dumbledore comes to visit and tells him about his mum's great love for him and saved him and Harry is overwhelmed with emotion and can't hold back the tears (a scene they unfortunately deleted from the movie, which I wish they'd included).  I could picture Dumbledore holding his hand as he cried, then took off his glasses and wiped his eyes.  I like how each of the Hogwarts Houses were described; the Slytherins weren't necessarily meant to be all-evil; they were noted for \\"cunning\\" which could be either a good or a bad trait.  It was Malfoy and some of his cronies that brought down that particular house.  It was good to see Harry, Ron, and Hermione recognized for their courage, even if they did have to skulk around to do it.  I think if anything, the book teaches that sometimes kids won't always do the expected thing, but 90 percent of the time, it's for a good reason, not because they're just being \\"bad.\\"  The book delves more into the psychology of the characters.

Same recycled backlash trip borrowed from the 1980's backlash anti-feminist books.  Same old ideas lifted from other backlash eras claiming that working moms &quot;shortchange&quot; their kids &amp; that the only narrow perscription for happiness for women is getting married early &amp; having kids young and resigning yourself to a life of being a housewife.  She blatantly insults women's intelligence by implying that women &quot;followed&quot; some small band of leaders and were &quot;duped&quot; into thinking, God forbid, of any other choices besides the same tired, hackneyed &quot;choice&quot; pushed on women in the fifties.  She also insults working moms by painting a rosy picture of the virtuous young housewife who &quot;gave it all up&quot; to be a &quot;perfect&quot; mother to her kids, implying that working moms don't love or care for their kids...the same guttersnipe lifted right from the eighties backlash era, almost plagiarously. The book's only good for a few laughs, but don't be duped by the message; most women I know, who are mostly working moms are happy and have well-adjusted happy kids who turn out well.	2002-03-28

Good, fairly accurate description of Helen's life, but there were a few inaccuracies. I have the feeling that the author was a little critical of poor Anne Sullivan at one point.<br /><br />Joan once mentions that Anne \\"reduced Mr. Gilman to a mass of quivering jelly\\" when talking about Mr. Gilman's (I think cruel) plot to forcibly separative Anne and Helen, wrongly implying that Anne was this domineering tyrant.  I was soo glad to read that Mr. Gilman's awful plan failed.<br /><br />But if anything, it was Mr. Gilman who tried to crush Anne; he had poor Anne in tears!  I got the feeling he was jealous of the close bond Anne and Helen had and their achievements.<br /><br />Another inaccuracy was the claim that Anne was \\"scornful\\" of women's suffrage; Anne was not; she just didn't pay too much attention to it until Helen got her into it; Anne was actually very much pro-suffrage by the time she'd split from John Macy.<br /><br />It was a curious thing another reviewer said that Helen \\"marketed\\" herself as a curiosity; I guess what it is was that both Helen and Anne had peculiar handicaps and used them as assets to support themselves rather than depending on others to support them.<br /><br />And it does still make their lives remarkable esp. since they lived in an era where neither handicapped individuals or women were encourage to lead independent lives.  All in all, a good descriptive biography.	2002-03-19

Very touching, vivid story told from a mentally disabled teenage girl's point of view; it's the first of its kind that I've ever read.  I love the bond that Emily develops with her new sister-in-law, Phyllis; I liked how Phyllis respected that fact the she was growing up & never talked down to her like so many people make the mistake of doing to mentally disabled people.  I'm so glad her parents slowly began to realized that she was growing up & needed more space & independence.  The book really delves into the world of the disabled & I like the scenes from the school Emily goes to.  What really thrills me is that Emily also learns who can be trusted & who can't; I cheered inside when Emily is able to use her intuition to know not to get into a car with someone she doesn't know well.  The book illustrates that yes, the mentally disabled CAN learn the same things others can, they just learn it more slowly & their minds take a little longer to absorb things.  I re-read this book right on the heels of a book about Annie Sullivan & Helen Keller; this book is a wonderful addition to the growing proof that more & more handicapped people, whether mental or physical, or leading independent, productive, happy lives.	2002-03-09
US	50761071	RULVMIQ4OP034	0440036542	226920224	Helen and teacher: The story of Helen Keller and Anne Sullivan Macy (Radcliffe biography series)	Books	4	11	16	N	Y	Informative!	Informative!  It does get a bit long and wordy at times, but it's a fair representation of Helen and Annie's lives.  The more I read about Annie Sullivan, the more I like her.<br /><br />I think it was a real shame that Arthur and Kate Keller felt threatened by the close bond Annie had with Helen.  I think Arthur and Kate just wanted Helen to be \\"trained,\\" but not really the free independent spirit she was meant to be.<br /><br />I'm so glad Annie stood by her and helped her become a free person and became a lifelong friend to Helen as well.  Annie was very open about whatever failings she'd had and was a warm, loving supportive guide in Helen's life.<br /><br />I get the feeling Helen and Annie had almost a mother-daugher-like bond, which of course practically killed Arthur and Kate.  The stupid thing was, the Keller parents wanted to just shift over the responibility to Annie of educating her and getting her to fit into society, yet wanted total control over Helen's life.<br /><br />If anyone was manipulative and controlling, it was Arthur and Kate.  Especially Arthur, I think was really patronizing and downright domineering toward Annie.<br /><br />Kate didn't help matters either and when I read about her attempts to break Helen and Pete up later on and her consent to try to split Helen and Annie up, I really lost respect for Kate.<br /><br />I know I'm slamming Kate and Arthur here, but I see Annie as more of a loving parent figure in Helen's life.  I really commend Annie for standing strong against Helen's domineering, manipulative parents.<br /><br />Oh, boy, was that John Macy a real creep!  I was sooo glad Annie got away from him; he accused Annie of being \\"manipulative and controlling\\" when he was controlling himself!  He KNEW Annie and Helen had a tight bond, yet after he married Annie, he started giving poor Annie a hard time about it!<br /><br />What was really contemptable was that John wrote to Kate and others badmouthing Annie behind her back and it's good that the book exposed that clearly.  That made me lose respect for John too; sorry, but I have no sympathy for John Macy.<br /><br />I think Annie tried really hard to be a good wife, yet John just criticized her for being too close to Helen.  Poor Annie, it was sad reading about her heartbreak.<br /><br />It was touching and kind of reassuring to read that it was Helen who came to Annie's support when Annie couldn't stop crying for several days over John.<br /><br />It was Helen who fired a letter off to John blasting him for badmouthing Annie.  I cheered when Helen was the one who helped Annie get back on her feet, esp. since I hear that John cleaned out the Macys' joint account and closed it without Annie's consent & Annie had to struggle to get her career going again.<br /><br />Boy, was it inspiring to read about Annie's heart healing and her getting her writing going again as well as back on her feet financially!  I love how Helen and Annie stood by each other all the way and once Polly joined them, stood by them too.  Annie's shaky pride suffered a lot of blows in her life, but always she managed to get back on her feet.<br /><br />I always knew Helen was forever grateful to Annie for freeing her from her early wordless prison and helping her get started to an independent free life and Helen showed this gratitude by being the one to take care of Annie when Annie grew old and frail, going permanently blind.<br /><br />It was a touching mother-daugher bond almost...when Helen was young, Annie looked out for her, then the roles reversed; when Annie got older and weaker, Helen was the one to look out for her and it was great that Helen was able to be by her bedside when her mentor and friend died.<br /><br />What was wonderful also was that Annie was a really sweet, accepting person; she had so many problems in her life, yet never sank into self-pity; she even made wry jokes about her blindness and even wrote a self-effacing column *Foolish Remarks From a Foolish Woman.*  That part cracked me up!<br /><br />Annie was a quick-tempered little thing, but was quick to forgive and had a big heart. I'm glad this book acknowledged that.  Even Helen said that Annie was generous \\"to a fault.\\"<br /><br />But the last best gift Annie gave Helen was the capacity to become completely independent, even from her, so once Annie died, with only a little help from Polly, Helen was able to live a free life, even long after Annie was gone.  I say kudos to both Helen Keller and Anne Sullivan!!!!oolish Woman.*  That part cracked me up!<br /><br />Annie was a quick-tempered little thing, but was quick to forgive and had a big heart.

A book on one of society's greatest hereos, Anne Sullivan!  Oh, boy, was her childhood a NIGHTMARE!!!!  Oh, she was so strong to endure so much; she endured more pain in twelve years than most human beings endure in her lifetime.  Poor Anne!  It's her dignity & courage that keeps her going throughout poverty, her dad's alcoholism & abuse, her mom's tragic death, her own lifelong battle with trachoma & being blind, her brother's horrible death in the poorhouse, the terrible conditions in the poorhouse...wow, and to think she survived that all & grew up to reach out to Helen Keller & other handicapped people!  Wow, were her cousins, John & Statia so stupid to dump her & Jimmie in the poorhouse; I wish I could just blast those two idiots for not understanding that they needed love & support, not to criticize Anne & put her down.  Well, it was their loss since Anne battle her problems & grew up to be a loving, wonderful person to be proud of.  The books goes through her arrival at Perkins, her difficulty dealing with her wounded feelings when other students make fun of her & when a teacher humiliates her, then her working hard & graduating valedictorian of her class.  The part with Helen also changed her life & I'm glad they found each other since their relationship blossomed into a beautiful lifelong friendship.  The part after the Breakfast Table Battle where Anne struggles & wins at getting Helen to eat with a fork is touching as it describes how Anne went up to her room afterward & cried.  Poor Anne didn't realize how out of control Helen was!  I found Arthur, James, & Kate a little shallow & short-sighted; after Anne opens the world of language for Helen, at first they fell all over her with praise since she'd \\"tamed\\" Helen so she'd be easier to handle, but I get the feeling that they, esp. Mr. Keller felt threatened by Anne & the fact that Helen had a closer bond with her than with them.  I like how it went into how their relationship deepened over the years & became almost like a mother-daughter bond.  Anne had her heart broken so many times throughout her life, yet I think Helen was one consistant light in her life.  One thing the book left out was Anne's disastrous short marriage to John Macy (who, from what I've read in other books, was a real jerk who broke her heart, cheated on her & was jealous of her & I think even hit her).  I would have liked to have read that there, but I guess since this was more of a teen-or-kid book, they didn't want to get into the sordid details of that.  Anne stayed true to herself to the end & encouraged Helen to do so too, much to the chagrin of the rest of the Kellers.  The best gift she gave Helen was her freedom & independence.  I thought it was really wonderful that Anne wanted Helen to be even independent of her, since once Anne got old & became permanently blind, she wanted Helen to continue her happy, productive, independent life long after she was gone.  It is such a good lesson of pushing yourself to be free, since once Anne died, Helen did just that...lived a free, independent life even without Anne & continued working on behalf of handicapped people everywhere.  As the last sentence in the book says, \\"Annie hadn't failed.\\"  She sure didn't'; she really was a success story.  WAY TO GO, ANNE SULLIVAN!

It's inspiring because it details the struggle to overcome serious handicaps.  Annie is my absolute favorite character.  I love the scenes with her & despite her own set of problems, like being blind herself & having terrible flashbacks & nightmares about her horrifying childhood, she gets her heart into getting Helen in touch with the world.  Anne is one courageous lady!!!  Even though I hear she was very modest about her accomplishments, Anne still deserves the honor of being remembered as the miracle worker of all time.  I love how she persisted even though the rest of the Kellers were just content to have Helen \\"trained.\\"  Anne wanted Helen to be free to live like a real independent human being & it's so touching how she became attached to the little girl even though Helen was VERY difficult to handle, knocking out two of Annie's teeth & locking her in the room, then later battling with her at the breakfast table.  And through it all, poor Annie struggles with trachoma hurting her eyes as well as being haunted by the death of her brother James.  Of course, having James Keller around to make stupid remarks doesn't help either & I often felt like telling him to shut up.  I get the feeling that there was a real power struggle between Arthur Keller & Anne too.  I think Kate wanted to stand by Anne, but was didn't want to oppose her husband, whom along with everyone else, called him \\"Captain.\\"  I mentally cheered inside when Anne gets a chance to be alone with Helen, then later when she finally gets through to Helen about language!  Anne really worked hard for that & I get the feeling that even though Kate & Arthur fell all over her thanking her at first because she'd \\"tamed\\" Helen, I read that later they really didn't appreciate Anne going the extra mile for them & teaching Helen to be independent & that's too bad because they really missed out on what Annie could have taught THEM and brought to their lives.  Here's to you, Anne Sullivan!ht to their lives.  Here's to you, Anne Sullivan!	2002-02-27

What a realistic beautiful portrayal of life 100 years ago!  The struggle of the immigrants to make it in the States is realistically portrayed.  I actually felt like I was there in that awful-smelling steerage hold & the scariness of the storm.  I thought it was interesting & neat that three girls from three different countries & religions form a strong bond.  Ellis Island was really accurate too; I especially loved the scene where the immigrants see Ms. Liberty (I personally think she's the most beautiful statue in the world!).  But what was really true-to-life was the struggle once the Levinskys get to the States & the portrayal of the sweatshop they're forced to work in seven days a week.  The descriptions were so vivid that I could actually feel the heat & grime of the garment sweatshop as well as visualize the rampant poverty & noisiness of the Lower East Side of New York.  It made me think of how we've come a long ways since, but still have a ways to go.  A great historical read for history buffs!	2001-09-25

Parts are raw &amp; touching, especially when Davey is not only dealing with her own grief, but is witnessing her brother &amp; mom's grief as well.  I thought her aunt &amp; uncle were a little controlling &amp; presumptious &amp; I cheered when Davey refused to let them control her.  I mentally crowed, &quot;She's gonna make it!&quot; when Davey's mother Gwen starts to get herself together &amp; decides to move back to Atlantic City, despite the objections of the aunt &amp; uncle, who I suspect, both had a rather selfish need to keep Gwen dependent on them.  I love the last chapter where Davey &amp; her family are walking along the beach together &amp; you get a sense that even though their dad will always be missed, they're still very much a family.	2001-08-18

Interesting start of having Liz headed to London for her third year of college, but it kind of went downhill from there.  I would have had Liz still get into London University &amp; go on to study there rather than just have her wander around helplessly in the British rain without a cent to her name.  And I was kind of disappointed with her parents in this book; they bailed Jessica out as usual (I can see them LOANING her money), then came after Liz at the airport &amp; ordered her to come back &quot;home&quot; as if she were still a child, then lectured her.  Maybe it wasn't the right thing for Liz to leave Jessica stranded, but I really think if the twins are almost twenty &amp; adults, Ned &amp; Alice should have stayed out of it &amp; let them resolve the conflict on their own, even if it meant Liz flying off to London for a few months.	2001-07-31

It can very easily happen even here in the US.  When you have the cliques who gang up on other kids &amp; make fun of others &amp; exlude others, it needs to be taken seriously, not passed of as just &quot;normal&quot; adolescence or childhood games.  Boy, does Aaron learn a powerful lesson when that awful Brian manipulates him into doing stuff to other kids.  Poor Aaron was wracked by guilt!  His granddad's warning about being careful about clubs was a good one.  We need more books like this to make sure this kind of history never repeats itself.	2001-03-10

The writing itself is excellent &amp; I love the little diary entries, but why in Sweet Valley's name is almost everyone( except Andy) hooked up &amp; so many of the plots revolving around romance?  I can some of the plots being romance, but all of them?  And boy!  Do Jessica &amp; Jade have a lot of growing up to do!  Jessica broke up with Jeremy, yet she falls into a jealous huff because Jade's going out with him.  I thought it was so spiteful of her to bring Jeremy over to where Jade was with another guy, then tries to get Jade fired from her job.  And Jade...I liked the Jade in the old series better; it's really too bad that Francine changed Jade too much like that.  Jade used to be thoughtful in the old series &amp; into ballet; now in this new series, Jade's only interests seem to be cheerleading &amp; getting boyfriends to show off.  I really wish this series would get deeper plots.  That would make this series a lot better.	2000-10-03

Her heart has just about healed from Logan;I'm glad Ann didn't latch her onto another boyfriend like so many other series would have done.  I liked that she joined the yearbook in a previous book &amp; she's doing more things.  It's so heartwarming that her house has been re-built &amp; she &amp; her family move back in.  I loved the descriptions; I felt as if I were right there with Mary Anne &amp; my heart just warmed for her.  She's been through so much pain &amp; suffering in her life &amp; it's good that she's happier now &amp; at peace.  She deserves peace &amp; happiness; she's such a good, courageous person!  I liked how she sensed that Sunny was still hurting from losing her mom, even though Sunny was hiding her pain under a facade of cheerfulness &amp; she comforted Sunny, even when Dawn got mad at Sunny.  It was funny how when the girls snuck off to New York City, Mary Anne felt so guilty.  I was sooo sure that she was going to break down &amp; fess up!  I'm surprised that she didn't.  The ending was gave such a sense of peace &amp; closure &amp; I'm glad that Mary Anne's feeling peaceful these days.	2000-10-03

I thought the part about the drinking at the class trip was realistic &amp; especially the part dealing with peer pressure was real when the Fantastic Foursome ridiculed the Fab Five for not joining in the drinking.  I liked how Katie was courageous enough to openly refuse to drink at  Shawnie's party no matter what others said.  Katie's always been my fave;  she has a lot of courage.  It was good that the other Fab Five members came  around &amp; resolved not to drink on the trip, even with Laura's teasing.  The descriptions of the Ellis Island trip was good &amp; I was touched by  how Katie was aware of the beauty &amp; significance of the Statue of  Liberty &amp; Ellis Island &amp; the important role immigration had in  American history.  I think Jana needs to grow up when it comes to  &quot;her&quot; Randy, though!  Randy tries to help Laura discuss trouble  that she has at home &amp; Jana falls into a jealous snit &amp; ruins the  trip for herself &amp; almost for Randy too!  And I think that when Laura  got drunk, then threw up on the trip, I get the feeling that Jana was  feeling superior.  Of course Randy comes back &amp; reassures Jana that  he's ever-devoted to her &amp; tells her, &quot;I'm glad you never handled  things the way Laura did.&quot;  Jana secretly gloats over Laura's mistake  &amp; the fact that Laura's embarrassed in front of everyone on the trip.  I think Jana needs to have a little more compassion, even if she doesn't  like Laura.	2000-06-21

I've read all of the  Ramona books over &amp; over, even though my parents used to wonder how I  could read some book so much &amp; about the same characters over again.  I  loved the wedding scene where Ramona saves her aunt's ring.  I also liked  where the girls are slowly maturing &amp; are staying home alone after  school.  It is there that they learn to handle conflict &amp; work it out  constructively &amp; to deal with the death of a beloved pet.  I STILL leaf  through the books sometimes, even though I've long outgrown them; it makes  me remember what it's like to be in third grade &amp; understand kids.	2000-04-25

One trouble I have with this series is that they're high school seniors, but they go out on dates on school nights &amp; they're rarely shown doing homework or studying.  And the Liz/Connor line is getting old; have Liz be single for a while (without falling into an  insipid depression).  I don't like the message to teenage girls that if you  don't have a boyfriend or are not dating, you must be some kind of weird  outcast or miserable.  In real life, teens are too busy with homework  &amp; getting ready for college than for dating &amp; partying on school  nights; save the partying for weekend nights.  Have these characters get  REAL plots other than romance &amp; partying, otherwise this series could  get insipid really fast!	2000-04-25

Parts of the book were slightly inane, such as when Jessica is falling into a depression over losing Nick, Liz tried to enlist Mike McAllery's help.  I think maybe Liz just needed to be a good listener while gently  prodding Jess to keep up with her classes &amp; friends...speaking of  classes &amp; friends, Jess needs to start figuring out some kind of career  plan.  She &amp; her brother Steve discussed that in &quot;Billie's  Secret&quot; SVU#18; it's high time she did something with her life besides  bounce from guy to guy.  Each time a romance starts, she's sure that the  guy is just &quot;right&quot; for her, that they're going to get married  &amp; all, but when it ends she falls apart!  I think if she were more  grounded &amp; had some inkling of what her interests &amp; talents are,  maybe when a romance does end, she wouldn't cope so poorly with it.  I  think maybe Liz could guide Jess toward some counseling, both personal  &amp; career.  Her sorority, especially horrid, rotten-hearted Alison Quinn  doesn't help matters at all!  I think Jess needs better, less shallow,  &amp; more understanding friends.	2000-04-07

I love how she gets up her courage to stand up to that mean  Cokie Mason &amp; put her in her place(not to mention going against her  dad's wishes, but for a good cause).  I also loved how her friends stood by  her &amp; stood up to Cokie too &amp; exposed Cokie's dishonesty in the  yearbook contest!

It's interesting to see how Beverly has evolved in her portrayal of childhood, especially young girls through the years.  Here in one of her early books, you can tell the story is set in the olden days (1950's).  Back in that era, moms were expected to stay home &amp; housekeep, whereas  dads were expected to go out to work five days a week.  Ellen's mom was a  stereotypical homemaker, spent the entire spring season spring-cleaning her  spotless house, &amp; Ellen calls her &quot;Mother.&quot;  Divorce &amp;  sex were NEVER discussed (although it was certainly around).  Little girls  were expected to be dainty, clean, always wear dresses(even to a  picnic!)&amp; always have their hair neat.  Ellen is a model for that  stereotype.  She brings a beet to school, not really out of a curiousity  for science, but to please her teacher.  In another scene where Ellen is in  dancing class, the class &quot;bad boy&quot; Otis comes sauntering into  class &amp; teases Ellen by imitating her.  Ellen just squirms &amp;  suffers in silence, not wanting to create waves.  Dresses are focused on a  good deal in this book.  Almost two whole chapters are devoted to Ellen  &amp; Austine's wearing matching dresses to school &amp; getting into an  arguement about the dresses.  One good realistic thing is that Ellen &amp;  Austine are loyal friends &amp; stick by each other, so at least girlhood  pals are recognized here in the ignorant 1950's.  From this book, then into  the 1970's to the 1990's, Beverly characters change along with the  enlightening of times, the result being that Ramona is now her main  character.  Beverly even deals with divorce in a recent book.  Even with  Ramona, even though her parents are happily married, Ramona recognizes that  there are kids in her class with divorced parents, something Ellen &amp;  her world never acknowledged.	2000-02-18

This book touches on a topic few people discuss...why some people are so sensitive.  I love how the author tries to reassure the highly sensitive that no, they not crazy or \\"flawed.\\"  I tend to be drawn to  highly sensitive people; many of my favorite celebrities, including singer  Steve Perry & the late Princess Diana are highly sensitive.  Also my  favorite fictional book character, Mary Anne Spier is very sensitive. So are my favorite sci-fi character Beverly Crusher and my favorite sitcom character, Jackie Harris.<br /><br />Sensitive people fascinate me; they seem to have a surreal, pleasing  quality about them that sets them apart from normal people.  Maybe that's  why many of them feel \\"odd\\" or \\"different.\\"  I like how  the book encourages the highly sensitive to learn to deal with their strong  emotions, not try to hide from them or let their emotions overwhelm them.  We need more research and books about sensitivity.	2000-02-11

I just love Mary Anne &amp; her endearing sensitivity &amp; her incredible courage!  She's such a lovely, sensitive person with a strong character!  It was a cute, funny opening scene in the beginning when Mary Anne is  feeling depressed &amp; watches a sad movie &amp; cries &amp; cries.   Trouble is, she doesn't feel much better &amp; goes to the BSC meeting with  red, swollen eyes.  Mary Anne gets involved in the readathon &amp; THAT  lifts her sadness.  But, wow, when the fires in the library were happening,  it was scary for her!  She even has nightmares!  Boy, were Mary Anne &amp;  Kristy heroes when they finally caught the firebug!  Another cute, touching  scene is when the librarians are giving out awards to the kids, Nicky Pike  whistles when Mary Anne is recognized for her hard work &amp; Mary Anne  blushes a bright red!  Then to top it off, Mary Anne ends up blubbering in  front of everyone!  It's so touching how she cries so easily.	2000-02-04

Lacey doesn't just have a problem; she's got a load of emotional baggage topped off by an attitude a mile long &amp; a humongous chip on her shoulder!  She has a rocky homelife, but doesn't cope with it well at all.  She's lucky to have Kristen for a friend; unfortunately, she doesn't  realize it &amp; treats Kristen like dirt most of the time.  I can see why  her dad &amp; stepmom don't trust her; she lies to them &amp; shoplifts!  At the rate she's doing, she'll end up in jail by the time she's twenty!	2000-02-03

I was sorry to see Abby, Jessi, &amp; Mallory drop out of the club.  I loved the parts of how Mary Anne is getting on with her life after the fire.  I was so touched when she decided  to give up going to camp with Abby &amp; Kristy to make sure her parents  were all right.  It was so good seeing Mary Anne's grandmother again!  I  hope Verna appears in more future books.  I just love her.  I love how  understanding she was of Mary Anne's sadness over the house fire.  Boy, was  I annoyed with Logan when he started butting into Mary Anne's business  &amp; acting as if she needed special protection!  I was glad that Kristy  urged her to stand up to Logan.  When Mary Anne &amp; her family went back  one last time to try to collect what they could from the remains of the  farm house, Logan had NO right to invite himself into to what was strictly  family business!  Mary Anne is one strong, courageous girl who doesn't  sugarcoat reality &amp; that's one reason she's my favorite character.  I  loved the scene where Jessi, Mallory, &amp; Shannon give Mary Anne a photo  album &amp; Mary Anne is so touched that she cries.  Another moving scene  is when Verna gives Mary Anne's family boxes of things that that had  belonged to Mary Anne's natural mother &amp; whatever bad feelings Richard  &amp; Verna had just melt &amp; they're re-united!  I know that made Mary  Anne relieved!  I like the letters between Stacey &amp; Claudia; those were  the funny parts.  Claudia's family was intending to &quot;get in touch with  nature&quot; by vactioning on a remote island...no TV, computers, or  dishwasher.  But the results are hilarious!  Meanwhile, Stacey &amp; her  dad are each dating someone &amp; each of them feel funny about the other's  spending so much time with that person.  I thought it was realistic that  Samantha's thinking of moving in with Stacey's dad.  All in all, touching,  some sad parts, funny, &amp; uplifting.	2000-02-02

I liked how, even though she  was missing Dawn &amp; Logan, she didn't sit around feeling sorry for  herself.  Wow, those parts where the fires were happening were scary for  her.  Poor Mary Anne has terrible nightmares!  The nightmares get worse,  considering that Mary Anne is anxious &amp; nightmare-prone.

It's endearing how she cries so easily.  I love how the girls in  the BSC solve their own mysteries &amp; problems unlike many of the girls  from the former Fabulous Five series who wait around for their boyfriends  to be the heroes.  There needs to be more books about girls as heroes.	2000-01-25
US	50761071	R3SCTTOT5JZLHR	9993346098	839877654	Standing Out	Books	3	8	8	N	N	Compromising plot...	I had mixed feelings about how Billie &amp; her family handle her growing up &amp; the arrival of her new brother.  One thing I did like was that  Billie realized that she did NOT have to give up baseball just because she  was growing closer to womanhood.  But several things bothered me.  I kind  of wished that when Billie goes dress shopping with Jess &amp; Liz to get  ready for a party, the twins had just let her pick out what she wanted,  even if it was just a denim skirt &amp; plain blouse.  I would have also  let her hair stay straight, maybe let it hang loose for the party.  The  main thing that was troubling was that when Billie parents are discussing  what to name the baby &amp; decide to name it after her dad's father,  William Arthur.  Billie overhears the conversation &amp; her parents assume  that she'll give up her own nickname when her mother says, &quot;I'm sure  Belinda will understand.&quot;  Even more shocking is that Billie's dad  says, &quot;And now we'll have a boy to carry the name on.&quot;  What an  awful thing for a girl to hear her parents say!  I gathered from that  comment that Billie's dad secretly preferred a boy &amp; Billie sensed  that.  No wonder Billie's devastated!  I would be too!  I don't think  Billie should have given up her nickname to become the &quot;proper&quot;  Belinda.  Yet this happens to many girls, maybe not their name, but they  are often pressured to give up unique parts of themselves to become a  &quot;proper lady.&quot;  Also discouraging was when Billie gets dressed  for the party (in the dress that the Wakefield twins wheedled her into  buying, along with curling her hair) everyone gushes over how beautiful she  is, then when she gets to the party, all the boys are falling all over  themselves to dance with her &amp; Billie is flattered.  It was dumb that  the book claims that the boys were &quot;finally treating her like a  girl.&quot;  When her brother arrives &amp; Billie goes to visit her mom,  it's a little unrealistic that Billie so easily aquieses to being called  Belinda &amp; gives up the name Billie for the &quot;real Billy,&quot; her  brother.  I would have had Billie hang on to her nickname &amp; maybe her  brother go by Willie or Will.  That would have been so much better &amp;  neat to have a Willie &amp; a Billie in one family!  I'm so glad that  Kristy Thomas &amp; Abby Stevenson of the BSC series hang on to who they  are, even if they're considered &quot;tomboys.&quot;  I think it's time we  put to rest the trite sexist plots of &quot;tomboy&quot; turned into a  &quot;proper young lady.&quot;le unrealistic that Billie so easily aquieses to being called  Belinda &amp; gives up the name Billie for the &quot;real Billy,&quot; her  brother.

This nonesense with Conner &amp; Liz has dragged on for TWELVE books!  I think Liz ought to be single for a while.  Get a new plot for her, one that DOESN'T involve a guy for a change!  Also  unrealistic is that all year, she's let her grades slide &amp; has been  going out on school nights, then when her guidance counselor calls her to  the office to discuss her grades &amp; contacts her parents, her mom nearly  has a fit.  Then she forgets an appointment with her counselor &amp; her  parents get hysterical &amp; ground her.  And of course by that time, Liz  is feeling rebellious &amp; sneaks Megan into the house.  Naturally her  parents catch her &amp; yell at her.  Then a ludicrous &amp; rather funny  part is that she sneaks out of the house &amp; goes to a party &amp; gets  drunk...then, of course Conner shows up to the rescue!  Conner's getting  rather annoying &amp; his lame, cynical &quot;tough guy&quot; attitude is  so old.  Francine needs to put a close to this drawn-out plot.	1999-12-22

I think Claudia should give Stacey a break &amp; realize that no guy is worth ruining their friendship.  I like that at least they're trying to work things out.  My heart went out to Stacey when she cried as she &amp;  Claudia were talking; I could see that Stacey didn't enjoy fueding with  Claudia.  I just hope Ann doesn't drag this Claudia-Stacey fight on for the  next ten or so books; I've always liked that the BSC books rarely dragged a  single plot on &amp; on for ten or twenty books like some other series do.  One good thing as a sort of subplot: I like that Mary Anne is getting on  with her life after her heart-wrenching breakup with Logan.  I admire how  Mary Anne never gets mired in self-pity (unlike Liz in the SVHSY series,  who is STILL lying around the house feeling sorry for herself after  Conner).  One cute scene is when Claudia &amp; Mary Anne go to a movie  together &amp; the movie is about a couple breaking up &amp; that makes  Mary Anne cry &amp; bawl her eyes red &amp; swollen nearly shut!  It's  inspiring that Mary Anne, even though she's still heartbroken, she's doing  things with her friends &amp; keeping her BSC notebook neat &amp;  mistake-free, as always.  It was also so good seeing Abby, Dawn, Jessi,  &amp; Mallory re-appear for Thanksgiving!  I'm so glad Ann didn't write  them completely out of the series; I miss seeing them as regular  characters.  I'm so glad the BSC is still friends with them.  I just hope  Claudia &amp; Stacey grow up really soon &amp; are able to work things out  so their precious friendship can continue forever!	1999-12-10

The portrayal of how difficult it is for a girl to be without a mother is real.  Mary Anne's dad also STILL makes her wear childish clothing &amp; wear her hair in braids.  Her dad means well, but  doesn't always understand her &amp; Mary Anne desperately needs a mother in  her life.  She gets into a HUGE fight with her friends that leaves her in  tears, then meets Dawn &amp; her mom, Sharon.  You might say it was the  beginning of the crazy Schafer-Spier family then, especially when Dawn  &amp; Mary Anne discover that their parents dated in high school.  But, too  bad Sharon &amp; Richard's parents didn't like each other &amp; separated  them.  So...there's a new twist...will Mary Anne &amp; Dawn be able to  re-unite them?  But the best scene is when Mary Anne is baby-sitting  little Jenny &amp; Jenny runs a high fever &amp; Mary Anne stays calm &amp;  acts responsibly.  I like how even though she's sensitive &amp; cries  easily, she's doesn't panic or fall apart in an emergency.  Here you begin  to see that she is one courageous girl &amp; her dad begins to see it, too  &amp; realize that she doesn't need to be &quot;protected&quot; all the  time.  Mary Anne is one person to be proud of!	1999-11-24

It was a very real portrayal of the struggles to adjust to life in a stepfamily.  Dawn discovers that being friends with someone &amp; LIVING with that person are two different things.  Dawn &amp; Mary Anne  each have different habits, like Dawn is a vegetarian &amp; Mary Anne is a  junk-food &amp; meat lover.  They discover that the CAN'T share a room  &amp; nearly drive each other to the brink of insanity when Dawn wants the  radio on &amp; Mary Anne needs complete silence to study.  I thought it was  funny &amp; creative how Dawn thinks up a way to scare Mary Anne, who still  believes in ghosts, into a near-faint!  Poor Mary Anne!  All in  all...realistic.	1999-11-23
