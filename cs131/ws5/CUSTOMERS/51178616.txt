The author does not spend any time at all delving into the problems that got the teens into the Unit in the first place.  I kept waiting for her to get more in depth with the characters, but it never happened.  Having said that, the plot was very interesting and I couldn't put the book down.	2004-11-09

It could have been much more in depth and the ending was so abrupt.  I wish Caroline Cooney would write yet a 4th book - either a prequel to tell  Hannah's story, or a continuation of Janie's story.  Is she really going to  forgive Reeve's betrayal, or move on with her life?  She still has so many  fears to deal with it would be nice to see her evolve into an independent  young woman.  So, Caroline, if you're reading this:  Please write more!   I'm hooked.	1999-07-23

Not only did I learn a lot of historical truth, I learned about courage.  This book provoked many emotions in me. Malcolm was one of those rare people that truly lived by  his principles and ideals.  He was not afraid to speak out passionately  about his beliefs, and not afraid to admit that he might have been wrong in  some instances.  He was fully alive, always thinking, questioning, and  preaching his beliefs.  After reading this book I came away with a  tremendous amount of respect and admiration for Malcolm X.  I wish everyone  would read this book because it is unforgettable.	1999-06-13
