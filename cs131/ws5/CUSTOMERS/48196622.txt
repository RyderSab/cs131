His past is forgotten because it is too painful for him to remember by himself, but he has help from a doctor. Throughout the book he describes his bike ride to his fathers house, that never happened, and the challenges along the way.<br /> It is a confusing book, and I would not recommend it to younger readers. The book is boring and drags on. I had to read the book twice before I could understand it properly. The author brought his point across which was, that you can't trust anyone in this world anymore.	2002-09-30

This book was a great read because it was action packed with many surprising revelations.<BR>The themes of this book would generally be to never jump to conclusions and never give up. These themes are clearly exposed throughout the book and make it even more meaningful for the reader. The age level i would recommend ranges from young adults, beginning at 12 because of difficult words and mild violence, to adults of all ages. I recommend this book to anyone in that age group who wants to read a great mystery.	2002-09-30

A lot happens in this 260 page book, like when he asks the girl of his dreams out on a date. My favorite part is when Gloria's dad is mad at him and he has to escape from their house.

As Hannah strides to survive, she also begins to lose hope of ever returning to the present, but she refuses to give up.<BR>   I enjoyed reading the Devil's Arithmetic because the plot was interesting and informative.  Although it contains a few unrealistic events, the facts it contains on the Holocaust are true and used well in the story.

Something that makes the book different from many others, is that it is told from two points of view; Julie Baker's and Bryce Loski's. Julie, for the longest time, has had a big crush on Bryce, her neighbor, who happens to absolutely hate her. For many years, a long story developes about Julie trying to get Bryce to like her, and Bryce trying to get Julie to stop liking him. As the story goes on, though, the two of them start maturing, and a strong theme developes. Treat others the way you would want to be treated, whether you like them or not. Through the course of events, one of the characters (I'm not saying who) starts to change their opinion of the other, revealing this very strong, yet true, theme. This is an excellent book that I would recommend to anyone from the age of about 10 on.	2002-09-30

Throughout the year she suffered emotionally because of this. Melinda learned that her life could be improved if she tried harder. There was little to no communication between Melinda and her parents or anybody. In the beginning of the story Melinda was very depressed; she cut school, didn't do her homework,failed classes, and moped around her room.

I read this book because I had read several excellent reviews about it.  It turned out to be one of the best books about historical events that I have ever read.  The author's decriptive tone gave me a clear image about the different chacters, settings, and events.  The theme in this book is that, as hard as it may be at times, you must learn to empathize with others to understand their feelings and points of view.  It is never easy to understand what someone has gone through unless you have experienced the same ordeal. Hannah had a hard time understanding what made her grandfather, who had survived the Holocaust, so angry when he saw Nazi footage on television.  That was until she herself went through a concentration camp.  <BR>The story has three main settings.  It begins in Hannah's grandfather's apartment in New York.  The story then moves to a small Jewish village in Poland, where Hannah lives for a short period of time.  The third and most important setting is in a concentration camp in Poland.  This is where most of the book takes place.  <BR>Although the vocabulary in this book is not remotely difficult, the reader has to know a bit of backround about the Holocaust to understand the book.  It is also a very emotional story, full of sacrifice and hatred.  For these reasons, I would recommend this book to anyone who is in the sixth grade and above.	2002-09-30

In this book, Toby, the main character, realizes that Antler, Texas is not exactly the most exciting place to grow up. Then, Zachary Beaver, the \\"fattest boy in the world\\", comes to their little town hoping to make money as a freak show act. Toby and his best friend Cal meet Zachary and are enthralled with Zachary's stories and tales of the far off places he has been, and as the stories are told, they gradually discover the meaning of friendship, which is the main theme of the book. This was a wonderful book, not only because it was touching, but also because it illustrated that it is not only what is outside, but mostly what is inside that counts. I would recommend this book to anyone, but specifically to fifth through eighth graders because it is not a difficult book to read.	2002-09-30

I chose to read it because I heard its author, Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, was thirteen when she had it published and this interested me.  I liked the book because its main character Risika, a compassionate three hundred-year-old vampire, becomes stronger emotionally and physically throughout the book.  The overall themes of this book were never give up and always have compassion.  After losing battles with Aubrey, a vampire  that eventually kills everything Risika has ever loved, Risika is finally able to avenge all of the hardships Aubrey has caused.  The question is: will she?  I would recommend this book to sixth, seventh, or eighth graders who like science fiction/fantasy.	2002-09-30

It's a story about an eccentric millionaire living in the late twentieth century who knows he is about to be murdered and developes his own mystery plan of finding the heir. The endlass riddles, clues, and solutions in this book made it more challenging to read. In addition, many of the 17 characters change and grow during the story because they have so many interaction with each other. Lonely characters find friends and those who are bored are challenged throughout the game.<BR>I would reccommend this book to others. I think this book was defintely more than just a story and the fact that the author was awarded the Newberry Medal proves it.	2002-09-30

It's a story about a dozen boys who are stranded on an island alone after the plane crash kills their parents.  Their biggest struggle was finding leadership among a group of immature children.  The main characters of this story are Raplh, Jack Merridew, and Piggy.  Ralph is the oldest, Jack is the leader of the choir, and Piggy is a fat boy who has no friends.  The theme of this story is that everyone should stick together no matter how bad conditions get.  As you near the end of the book, the boys begin to spread apart into a group of savages with no rules.  Sadly, all the disorder ends in two of the boys deaths.  I recommend this book to anyone from the 7th or 8th grade.  You should read it sometime.  It is a really great book.	2002-09-30

I like this book because of the way the author put the plot together. He had two ideas happening at once and ending up coming  together at the end for a huge climax. The only thing that was hard to understand was the way some of the characters talk in the book. All characters talked in Old English. Every part in the book is important for the climax. If you skipped a chapter or even a page you will miss something important. You have to read the series to be able to understand where the characters in the book are talking about. Alot of this book is about the past of the two main characters and how they have to find each other to explain why this is happening in the book.	2001-12-06

I must of read the book 5 times because it was so good. Believe me when I say this I never read a book more than once. I like it because it teaches kids my age about how they shouldn't judge people by how they look. For example when certain baseball teams said, &quot;Jackie couldn't play on their team because of his race&quot;. When he was better than half the their team. <BR>     Another good reason is that it is a non-fiction book so you know ever thing is real. For instance everbody thinks he had an easy life after he joined the MLB but in the book it shows what really went on, on and off the field. LIke when fans would scream at him and players would try to peg him or take his needs out when he was running. I would defiantly buy this book because it is somewhat about how baseball use to be and about one of the best baseball player that ever lived and to play the game.

In this diary this girl started off like any normal girl who had a loving family.  One night at a party she had tried LSD, and because it was such a great experience, she wanted to explore all the other drugs other than that.  When she finally realized that drugs weren't the answer she stopped but he life had changed so much and it would never be the same.  Throughout the rest of the school year she was harrassed by all the students and she was known to be the one that always did drugs.  You may think that it is okay to try just a few drugs but it's not.  They're dangerous and will ruin your life just like they did to her.  After reading this true story, I hope teenagers will start to think twice.  I encourage everyone possible, even parents, to read this book and see what it's like.  You will definately think twice!	2001-12-06

It is very sad what Berry is going through.  She doesn't even want to be with her dad.<BR>   <br />   Berry doesn't want to go with her dad, even though she is going to a nice suite.

His name is Stanley Yelnats and he gets accused of stealing a pair of shoes from a museum. He gets sent to a camp for juvenile kids. In the camp there are different groups, Stanley gets sent to group D where all of the boys give each other nicknames. The punishment was they had to dig holes 5 feet wide 5 feet deep everyday, the warden says they dig holes to build character but Stanley thinks she is trying to find something  very important. I recommend this book because unlike some books that are boring in the beginning and start getting good at the end this book is always exciting from the first page.	2001-12-06

I liked this book because it had a lot of drama.  I also liked it because I was amazed that Ernest could make a good book out of catching a fish.<br />     This book was about an old man's desire to catch the biggest fish in the sea.  He goes through many obstacles through the story to delay him from possibly catching the fish.  His line almost breaks, and he needs to somehow get food for his long journey.<br />     I would encourage everybody to read this book.  If you like drama and excitement, you will like this book.  I would recommend the book for all reader's except for beginners.	2001-12-06

It's a real page turner and really relates to real life. The part I really liked was it was written by a teenager, S.E. Hinton. The author wrote it so people my age could relate to it and we could read it easier since it was written on our point of view.<BR>   The Outsiders is about life. How you can live on either the bad or good side of the tracks which determines whether your a greaser or a soc. The greasers are regular people only they dress differently and aren't great off money wise. The socs are high class kids with a lot of money and too much freedom. The socs and greasers have always been enemies and are always getting into fights with each other. One great thing about the greasers is they are like one big family. For example, Johnny and Ponyboy get into a bad fight and a soc ends up being killed. A friend of theirs helps them escape police and hide out until things cool down. That just goes to show how tight they are with each other. They risk their lives and freedom for each other.<BR>   I definitely recommend this book to all teenagers. Even if you don't like to read you'll love this book. It really touched me and I wish more people knew how things aren't always how they seem. To let them realize they shouldn't take everything for granted. I know I do now that I've read this book. I really hope hope teenagers all over will read this book and like it as much as I did.	2001-12-06

This book was a very good book and the way it was set up was very different because you would never guess the ending.<br /> It was about 10 people that got letters from someone who was in their past. The letters said that they wanted them to come to an island far away called Indian Island. When they all got there they relized that they were the only ones in the house except the maid and her husbsand, they took care of the house. So they were going to try and leave the next morning but when they went to see if any boats were coming there were none. So they ended up staying there for a while.And the whole book is based on the poem The 10 Little Indians.The only reason I gave it four stars was because I think that the author jamed alot of information in the second chapter and I kind of got confused. It doesn't sound like a good book but I just don't want to give away the ending!	2001-12-06

It is partially real while on the other hand it has fiction woven into its pages. The boy, Brent, that the story is about, is as real as a teenage boy can get. He has his good times and his bad times. The story is written and put together in a strange way. It finishes one chapter of Brent traveling. Then in the next chapter, it tells about a totally different character that is living in the city Brent is visiting next. Then the chapter after that is about Brent in that same city.<BR>I enjoyed the book, but the character chould have had more interesting encounters. The story just goes on and on. The beginning was better than the rest of the book. The story line was written well in detail, but in my opinion, it just seemed boring. Otherwise, the book was good.<BR>I would recommend this book to anyone who likes books about people who have mental problems or who have killed people in automobile accidents. This book's character deals with these two problems.	2001-12-06

He liked little kids a lot, he liked how they acted. Jason was acused of murdering a young girl who he liked to  play with every once in a while. Since he was the last person to be seen with her, they pointed the finger at him.<br />I could have given this book a lower rating but the book was exciting in a way that made me never put it down until the book was done.

I liked it because it didn't drag on that much. It kept going. Also, some of the words in it were hard to read and understand, but once you got going on it, it was easier to read. <BR>It started out with ten people being invited to Indian Island for a summer vacation by someone that they have never heard of before. Once they get there they go into their rooms and there was the poem &quot;Ten Little Indian Boys&quot;. Each verse is how each murder happens. The first verse says that one indian boy choked himself and the first man that dies had choked himself. Then the next verse says that an Indian boy choked himself and in the story that is what happened in the second murder of the story. And it went that way throughout the book.	2001-12-06

He and his family one-day find out what the cost of being ignorant is. The Nazi's come to his town and quickly starts placing all the Jews who live there into ghettos. Elie and his family go through unspeakable torture. They are sent to Auschwitz. Auschwitz is infamous for being one of the most unbelievable death and work camp in the Nazi history.<br /> This book helped me to see the real horrors of the holocaust.

The things I liked about this book was that the whole book was exciting.  Basically every part of the story wants to make you continue reading it.

In describing the &quot;Old man&quot;, he says, &quot;his eyes were as blue as the sky and his face was as pale as a ghost.<br />  Some of the dislikes I had in this book was that for basically the whole story the old man is in the boat.  Also, when the old man sees the big fish he keeps trying to catch it for a long time.  Another dislike is that the old man almost dies trying to catch the fish.

Some of the reasons I enjoyed the book is because it described a lot about racism. Another reason I enjoyed the book was because it taught a lot about racism and how you shouldn't judge people by their skin color or race.<br />There were some parts of the book I didn't care for. Some of the plot lines were a little shaky. It also had a disappointing ending.<br />All in all, I thought the book was OK but it could have used some work.	2001-12-06

This book is so entertaining I couldn't put it down.  All the events that happen in this diary are not only true but unforgetable.  <BR>   When this anonymous girl runs away, does drugs, and gets sucked into a another world that she can't seem to get away from.  The only thing that kept this girl alive was her diary.  If you like graphic horrifying reality or any kind of drug use in a book or movie, I am more then positve that you will like this book.  Go Ask Alice is a superb example of a novel.  Not only I would recommend this book for teens but their parents as well.	2001-12-06

It's full of adventure and excitement. <br />The book is about a young boy who lives with his aunt, uncle, and cousin because his parents died.  His aunt and uncle never treated him well.  On his eleventh birthday, he recieved a letter from a school for wizards and witches, known as Hogwarts.  The letter said that he has been accepted into the school.  He didn't believe it until the messanger used magic against Harry's uncle which was refusing to let Harry go.<br />So Harry goes off to school and makes some friends that help him learn things about the magic world, since his aunt and uncle never told him a thing about magic and that he was a wizard.  Why he's there he plays a wizard sport called quidditch.  The book has a great ending, and I suggest that you read this if you like adventure stories.	2001-12-06

Bernard Malamud wrote this book brilliantly. He uses his knowledge of baseball and creative talent to write a book about a man's life long struggle to become a professional baseball player. There were only really two minor things that I did not like about this great book the first is that it was a little hard to follow with the characters frequent flashbacks and dreams.<br />It made it hard for me to exactly know when it was describing present day and when it was talking about a dream or telling a flashback. The second problem I had was when the book was talking about one of the main character's girlfriends, and since he had so many it was hard to tell which on the book was explaining.<br />These two minor problems were easily overcome, but still were noticeable to be mentioned from memory. This book was an excellent portrayal of a baseball story, which gave the reading that little edge and twist.	2001-12-06

The authors Jack Canfield, Mark Victor Hansen, and Kim Kirkberger are brilliant to have thought of this. Teens send in their stories of friends, family, love, life and death. Canfield, Hansen, and Kirkberger read the stories, pick certain ones and publish the stories. Then teens all over read them. This book teaches lessons in life. The lessons you usually have to learn on the way through your life.<br />There's stories that will touch your heart, make you laugh, or make you cry. I highly recommend this book to anyone, not just teens. The book is in sections, so its not like you have to read the hole book to understand whats going on. If you are interested in a book that tear at your heart and teaches valuable lessons, I recommend Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul.	2001-12-06

If you like Maniac Magee, then you will definitely love this book. <BR> <BR>Stargirl was a very unusual girl who had trouble fitting in.  The way she would try to get people's attention is very unusual.  She would sing to people on their birthdays and play her ukulele.  Everyone startd to like her, but she started to be a little TO nice to people and everyone turned on her except, her boyfriend, Leo.  I really think that everyone should read this book.  This book might not sound that good now but I don't want to give to much of it away.	2001-12-06

Zindel is able to develop the main characters, John and Lorraine, extremely well. The plights of growing up are clearly defined as John and Lorraine struggle to understand what friendship is all about until it's too late.<br />The plot line is not all that great, however, Zindel should be able to grab readers for years to come through his characters and theme.	2001-12-03
