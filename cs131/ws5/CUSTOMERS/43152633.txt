Books	4	4	8	N	N	The life of ancient Egypt	It is 1493 B.C. and Egypt is a thriving empire under the rule of a female Pharoah, Hatshepsut. It is during this time that Maia lives, in the major city of Thebes. However Maia's life is cruel and harsh just like the waters of the Nile when it floods. Her and her brother were orphaned and left to live with their uncle and aunt. Maia's life is full of hardship as her uncle and aunt treat her poorly and constantly berate her. Maia knows she must find a way out before her life is ruined. She secretly pleads with her brother, Sethnet, to teach her how to read and write since he is studying to be a scribe. Sethnet finally does agree and the course of Maia's life is dramatically changed as she will use this new skill to her advantage and finally escapes Thebes and her unwelcome uncle. This book was a good edition to the Life and Times Series. Ann Turner has always been good at writing historical fiction and this book was another classic Ann Turner book. She successfully brings to life the daily working of Ancient Egypt and the intrigue that goes along with that era. Will be a good read for fans of the series.	2005-05-21

She is a mediator---a person who guards wayward souls(ghosts)back to where they should be, their final resting place. Of course being a mediator also causes some social problems for Suze. After moving to California, so far for Suze things have been fab. Even the hottest guy in town, Tad Beaumont, asked her out! Everything couldn't be better. That is until the ghost of a dead woman shows up in the middle of the night and screams for Suze to find a guy named \\"Red\\" and tell him he isn't responsible for her death. Tracking down a murderer is pretty hard but when things lead to \\"Red\\" Beaumont, Tad's dad, things get alittle tricker. After not listening to Father Dominick, a fellow Mediator, who also happens to be Suze's principal, Suze goes all by herself to see Red only to find out he might be a vampire. Things get even crazier as Suze digs deeper into the mystery and finds out about coverups, mysterious disappearances, and a web of deceit. <br />Another good edition to the Mediator series. A lot of unexpected twists and turns and Jesse and Suze are such a cute couple!	2005-05-14

Things start going from okay to bad when Suze is awakened by Maria de Silva---the ex-finacee of the 150 year old hot ghost that shares Suze's bedroom, Jesse---with a knife to Suze's neck, telling Suze to stop her stepdad, Andy, from digging up Jesse's body from her own backyard. Suze has a good idea that when the body of Jesse is discovered she might lose him forever, but she isn't about to help Maria de Silva. Suze knows, however, Maria de Silva will do anything to stop the digging, even if it does mean killing Suze. As Suze digs deeper into the mystery surprising things happen in a world that Suze can't control, but even though helping Jesse might risk certain death onto herself, Suze is ready for the challenge.  <br /> <br />Wow! What can I say? The best Mediator book yet with revelations at every corner that are more shocking that before. This is definitely a pivatol book in the series and a turning point. The cliffhanger ending makes you want the next book, Haunted, like crazy.	2005-05-14

Besides that her new life is actrully pretty cool. That is until she finds a 150 year old hot ghost named Jesse living in her bedroom. You see, Suze is a mediator---a person who guards wayward souls back to their final resting places, wherever that might be. For Suze, this gift she has is more like a curse. But at least this new ghost who is sharing her bedroom is pretty attractive, not like Heather, the crazy ghost at her school who is out to revenge her own suicide. It looks to Suze like alittle talking isn't going to help getting Heather back where she should be...it is time for some action. This was a pretty thrilling beginning to the Mediator series. Coupled with some humor, and twist and turns that keep you guessing this book is definitely to be read.	2005-05-14

The new guy in school is creating a lot of buzz and it just happens to be Paul Slater, a hot, but very evil fellow mediator whose been giving Suze nightmares all summer. Suze though is intent on staying committed to Jesse, even though he has been avoiding her ever since their intimate kiss and it doesn't help that Paul seems to know a lot more than Suze does about a mediator's powers and what it could do to certain ghost, like Jesse. Not only does Suze have to deal with Paul, but her stepbrother Sleepy has brought back a new college friend who also happened to bring along a resentful dead brother. Things aren't working the way Suze had hoped for and for once her fears may be catching up with her. <br /> <br />This book had so many plotlines and what Paul said about mediators was somewhat confusing. The next book should clear up some of the confusion though. This overall had to be the weakest book in the series. The humor and edginess was definitely missing but it is still a good read even though Meg Cabot wasn't at her best.	2005-05-14

Most people familiar with the Arthur legend know of the father-son conflict between Arthur and his illegitmate son, Mordred, a product of a one night stand with Morgause, Arthur's half sister. Because of the unfortunate events leading up to his conception, Mordred is seen as being born evil, predestined to do harmful acts. The wizard Melin phrophesizes that Mordred's fate is to kill his father and destroy Camelot. Thus Arthur tries to kill Mordred when he was a baby, yet Mordred is saved by a fisherman and his wife. When young Mordred learns of his true identity, he rides to Camelot hoping to become a knight and finally get to know his famous father. Yet Camelot is not what Mordred had hoped for. His father, Arthur, doesn't even so much as acknowledge him and the affection that Mordred hopes Arthur would show him is nonexistent. Mordred becomes a loner in Camelot and soon begins to hear voices in his head telling him to fulfill his phrophecy. Mordred, longing for Arthur's love and acceptance, would do almost anything to cheat his destiny, even selling his soul. <br /> <br />I Am Mordred is one of the best works on Mordred I have ever seen. He is one of the most misunderstood characters in the myth and the preconception that he is evil because of the circumstances of his conception is quite unfair. Springer tries, and effectively, pictures Mordred as a young man trying to fight his destiny, yet the more he tries, the more closer he comes to fulfilling the fate we all know happened. The reader feels very sympathetic towards Mordred, yet sits there unable to save him. In the end you realize that Mordred was not what the famous Arthur authors wrote him to be, born evil, but instead a boy that needed love and attention from a father he so wanted acceptance from, but in the came up empty. Like I am Morgan Le Fay, this book is more of a physcological work that raises new questions to previous assumptions. I definitely recommend this book to all fans of Camelot. It is one of the best.	2004-12-04

In Buring the Sun, the continuation of the stories first told in Angel on the Square and The Impossible Journey, 14-year-old Georgi and his family have returned to the city of Leningrad, rented a little apartment, and started up a new life. Leningrade, 1941, is a peaceful city, grand and beautiful but all changes when Germany turns against Russia and WWII finally hits the communist country. Suddenly Georgi's life becomes a whirlwind of change in preparation of war. His mother joins the Russian army as a nurse, his sister Marya is working at the Hermitage, a museum, where she is helping pack up the artwork so that they can be sent somewhere safer. Georgi is too young to join the Russian army but that doesn't stop him from trying to help the war effort. He and his friends do tasks around the city to help the needy. However the days grow darker as food and supplies is cut off from the city and the residents are literally starving to death. Georgi sees the once grand and tall city change in just a few months into hell. Is there some way he can help the city survive? <br /> <br />Gloria Whelan has once again written a poignant historical novel. Like its two predecessors, Burying the Sun doesn't try to hide the cruelities of war and famine. Instead Whelan tells the truth in a way that is not too horrific but still gets the suffering across. Her biggest achievement though is showing how the determination of one young boy managed to illuminate a city shrouded in the darkness of war.	2004-11-27

However Chloe's secret abilities not only make her special, but targeted, by The Order of the Tenth Blade, an organization out to destroy all of Chloe's kind. Gradually Chloe begins to understand her true nature and that she is part of the Mai, and Easter European species of humans that have developed unual powers of a cat. Chloe is not alone in her fight against The Order of the Tenth Blade, who will stop at nothing to destroy the Mai. However keeping herself alive may be easy compared to keeping her family and friends, Amy and Paul alive. Unfortunately they don't have NINE lives, they just have one. Can Chloe trust Brian, a member of the Order who says he is on her side to help her? And what about her attractions to him? Are these attraction making her blind to Brian's true nature? Ultimately, can she trust him? <br /> <br />More developments in the second book made this a tad better than the first installment. There were more suspensful moments and the book moved along just fine. Still not the best supernatural series out there which is why it doesn't deserve 5 stars. Still, I really recommend teens who enjoy the FEARLESS series, which just ended, to pick up this new series.	2004-11-24

It turns out that his owner, Master Lucius Opimius, is a spy for the Emperor, on the lookout for any traiters. Opimius eventually makes Atticus a spy himself and unexpectatly one day Atticus hears the plot to assasinate the emperor. Atticus and his Master manage the foil the assasination attempt and at the celebration festeval, Atticus meets the one person he never thought he'd see again, his father.  <br /> <br />I'm sad that I have to give only two stars to an author whose books in the Dear America series I have thoroughlly enjoyed. Unfortunately there were just so many things wrong with Attiucs. The plot had tons of holes and the writing style was just so dull. It took me 4 days to read this book when it would usually only take me 1 if it were interesting. I don't see little kids having enough resolve to finish such a dull book that falls flat in the end. There really was no climax and I don't rememeber one time that I felt on the edge of my seat or had any anticipation. There were also other numerous mistakes that the editor should have caught but didn't. The good thing is that the other book in this series, Pandora of Athens, is quite enjoyable and should be read even if you didn't enjoy this book. Overall a big disappointment. After Pandora, I was expecting something way better than this big mess of a book.	2004-11-14

Athens, where life for women and their rights are mostly denied. Pandora deeply loathes the fact that she has no say in her life and that on her fourteenth birthday she will have to marry a man she deeply despises, her cousin, Menander, who also happens to be twice her age and very monotone. Her life takes a change though when she meets the Wise One while fetching water. Socrates is a very respected greek scholar and he tells her things that will profoundly change Pandora's life forever. Things seem possible now including marrying Phoenix, Socrates' young disciple, whom Pandora adores. However as Socrate's famed trial begins, Pandora finds herself mingled in the intrigue and politics of Ancient Greece and having to choose between her true love and the stability of someone she doesn't love. I enjoyed this first book in the new series Life and Times. Unfortunately the book should have been a tad longer because the ending came very quickly. It should have been more developed. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of this series as it comes out and I think readers who enjoy girl protagonist and ancient history will enjoy this book very much.  <br /> <br />	2004-11-13

One called 'LEPrecon' - The story of Captain Holly Short's move from Traffic to Recon, and how she became the first female officer to serve under Commander Julius Root and the other is called Seventh Dwarf(which I had already read when it was published earlier, just not in the United States). <br /> <br />LEPrecon was somewhat of a disappointment. The villian, who has a very interesting background, turns out to be flat in the end and the story was just lacking the usual Fowl smartness and edginess. The story is pretty much a prequel that explains the beginning of Holly and Root's relationship. The Seventh Dwarf on the other hand was much better. Mulch Diggins returns as he and Artemis plot to steal a diamond off a word famous tiara. They run into some problems with the LEPcron, namely Holly Short, though trying to steal the tiara from a band of circus dwarfs. This story had the usual Fowl flair and the ending was very interesting.  <br /> <br />The rest of the book is composed of various sections that include interviews with the main characters of the series, a fairy code to decode, a gnome alphabet, guides on technology, a very interesting report card of Artemis Fowl's, and some puzzles to solve. I found the interviews most entertaining and the puzzles were okay, though some were quite unchallenging. Overall the book is a good one to fill your time while waiting for Artemis Fowl: Opal Deception.	2004-11-13

Few see Morgan le Fay as what she is depicted as in Nancy Springer's version in which an innocent young girl meets her demise because of the evil actions of those around her. <br /> <br />Morgan le Fay was a normal girl until she saw a man that looked exactly like her father go to bed with her mother Igraine. However, that man was not her father, who had died hours before in battle, but the king, Urther, who lusted after her mother. Soon Uther takes Igraine to be his wife and little Morgan and her older sister Morgause are left to live with nurse Ongwynn. However as the landscape becomes more and more dangerous Morgan and her sister must escape with nurse Ongwynn to her secret home. There Morgan learns her magical powers and falls in love with Thomas, an intriguing young man. Desperate for answers to her life, the young teenage Morgan sets off to find her mother in Avalon. Along the way she faces many trials and her relationship with Thomas deepens. Yet in the end rejection and selfishness leads to Morgan's ultimate demise and her fall into darkness begins.  <br /> <br />Morgan comes off as a very powerful character who you feel sorry for because a lot of things in her life were uncontrollable. The path to her demise is hard to read because the reader wishes every step that Morgan had made a different decision to save herself. The romance between Morgan and Thomas is the shining part of the story and its bittersweet ending is hard to swallow. Besides Morgan and Thomas, other characters were weak, with probably the exception of nurse, who came across as a very motherly figure. Igraine hit a sour note with me. I just didn't really see much in her. The ending was a bit odd but hints at the future of Morgan. The villian in the story was very weak and you feel a bit betrayed in the end with the demise of the romance. In the end Nance Springers version of Morgan was very insightful and will be a hit with all fans of Camelot.	2004-11-05

She lives in Hickory Heights, a small town in the state of Virginia that is right in the midst of the Union and Confederate army's attacks. Her family is caught up in the battle too. Her old brother Lawrence enlisted in the Confederate army and her younger brother Jamie joined the Gray Ghost, John Mosby. Annie and her mother cannot avoid the war either. Together they tend to the many wounded Confederate soldiers. The experience is very hard on Annie but she takes even more daring roles to help the Confederate cause. Soon she is dubbed Lady Liberty by Lawrence's commanding office Jeb Stuart for her acts to help the Confederate army defeat the Union forces. However Annie's views on the war change when a Union officer is dragged to her farm. Thomas Walker was saved from being hit by a bullet because of his volume of Keat's poetry and soon he and Annie connect because of both's passion for poetry. As tragedy and conflict erupt in Hickory Heights, Annie must question her stance in the war. Which side is really right? Which side is the one she believes in? I am a big fan of L.M. Elliot's Under a War-torn Sky. The book is still one of my all time favorite historical fiction stories. Annie, Between the States was not as good but it is still a worthy addition to my Civil War collection. Annie is a strong protagonist that most girls will connect with.

Nell is overjoyed that she will soon begin the required training to become the Imperial Wizard. However an unexpected twist of events might threaten everything for Nell. When Nell's father, King Einar, discovers that his long lost son, and Nell's twin brother is actrually alive, he denies Nell the right to proceed with her training. The boy instead must become the Imperial Wizard like tradition says. Nell is of course extremely hurt and outraged, even more when she finds out that her twin brother is no other than Owen, the person she used to pose as her at the Witch Academy so that she could complete her quest. Now all seems to be lost just because she is a girl. That is until Owen falls into the hands of the evil forces. Nell once again must prove that she is worthy to become the Imperial Wizard and save the day for her family and Eldearth. <br /> <br />This is a worthy continuation of Nell's story. Nell is a strong girl character that appeals very well with the audience. Girls will very much like to read about her battle against prejudices and how she beats all the odds against her.

All of Eldearth is worried that their peaceful days are over. Eleven-year-old Princess Arnelle \\"Nell\\" who has overcome an extremely difficult task to be the next Imperial Wizard, must use all her intelligence and wit to stop the forces of the Dark Lord from extinguishing the Scepter of Light, which has always protected Eldearth from Graieconn. However soon Nell comes to the realization that she cannot do it alone. She must have the help of her twin brother Owen, her competitor for the title of Imperial Wizard. Can Nell and Owen work together to stop the dark forces? Will the two be strong enough? <br /> <br />This was a good conclustion to the Keeper's Trilogy. This wasn't my favorite fantasy trilogy but did have a very headstrong heroine that will connect with many young girls. Though this series is reminiscient of other books I have read, it does have its own uniqueness in some areas. Its a good book to read for leisure. A definite recommendation.	2004-10-29

The Imperial Wizard, The Keeper of the Light, is dying and if someone new is not found soon, Eldearth will fall into darkness and the evil hands of Lord Graieconn. The tradition has always been that the Imperial Wizard is a wizard, a boy, but time is running out and all the boys who have attempted the extremely difficult quest to become Imperial Wizard have failed. It looks like a different tactic must now be used before time is too late. <br /> <br />Eleven-year-old Princess Arenelle, \\"Nell\\", daughter of King Einar, has always shown promise in witchcraft and wants to undertake the difficult quest. Of course her father forbids it mostly because she is a girl and fearing for her overall safety. Nell, being the cunning intelligent girl she is, comes up with a plan to evade her father and sets out on her quest. Along the way she meets many of the people and creatures of Eldearth and sees their many trials. She gains some wisdom and through her kindness to the people Nell shows her true colors. Soon she has an albino dragon, whom she saved from death, and folk helping her on her quest. Can she prove herself worthy to be the Imperial Wizard? <br /> <br />I have always enjoyed the magic of fantasy and this book was no exception. I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy. However some parts of this book were quite reminiscent of other books I've read in the past. This is not the first time I've heard of something called the Keeper of the Light. I think that was also part of the Rowan books by Emily Rodda. However Koller manages to give her own spin to these books and Nell is a true heroine. A definite recommendation.	2004-10-28

Bound by the old traditions of China where she must become the servant of her stepmother after her father's death. Bound by the injustice and ill treatment of women. Bound to remain a servant the rest of her life and be neglected by society. Bound to never find a husband because she has no parents to arrange her a suitable marriage. Xing Xing spends her days being a slave girl to her half-sister Wei Ping who is also bound, but in a different way. Wei Ping has her feet cruelly bound to make them small, a tradition in China, that symbolizes wealth and elegantness, a painful compulsory act if a girl is going to marry into the high society. Xing Xing however does not complain about her role in the family and secretly feeds her passion of and gift of poetry and calligraphy. She secretly dreams of a different life of freedom, a life that seems so far away, that is until the village has its annual festival, a big celebration in which Xing Xing's stepmother hopes to find a husband for Wei Ping. Things are going to change however and greed in the end might threaten all that Xing Xing has built up for herself. <br /> <br />I am a Chinese-American and I really did feel this book lived up to my expectations and the Chinese Cinderella myth that is was based on. Life in Ancient China was not easy for women and the bound feet was something that my great-great-grandma had to go through too and it was a terrible experience for her. I have become a fan of Donna Jo Napoli after her book Daughter of Venice and Bound lived up to everything I'd hoped for. A definite recommendation!	2004-10-25

These rich, beautiful, wild life Upper EastSide New York kids are still up to their backstabbling, malicious ways but this time life is gonna throw them some curveballs.<br /><br />Blair is still waiting to see if she'll be accepted by Yale but after the whole interview mess and accidental affair with an older man things don't look so great, but meanwhile her obsession with ex-boyfriend Nate continues, though she is finding new avenues in her life, including letting go of her major Audrey Hepburn obssesion. Yeah, bet we expected that. Nate himself is turning over a new leaf after getting busted for drugs. He is sent to counseling where he saves a girl who overdoses. A drugged Snow White beauty would be a nice way to describe her and it looks like Nate's romantic status is headed in a different direction.<br /><br />More emphasis is put into Dan and Vannessa's relationship, and less on Serena, though I find her increasingly annoying. Dan, the romantic poet gets his poem published in the New Yorker somewhat by accident and then meets a yellow toothed lady whom he goes off and has an affair with. Call that messed up!<br /><br />Serena and Aaron are finally an item, but who knows how long that will last knowing Serena...Jen is moving on to a new man since Dan no longer seems to have time for her...Things are changing and the scandals/soap opera is getting weirder by the minute but the biggest question is still: Who is Gossip Girl? Could it be someone we least expect??? A definite must read though not as good as the previous few. Some storylines were a bit dull but still not one to miss:) Probably not your mother's favorite cup of tea but who can resist some guilty pleasure?	2004-10-19

Its Christmas time in the prestigious Upper East Side of New York and that means midterms, presents, breakup and get togethers, and college essays. <br /> <br />Serena and Blair are friends again, and back to their old tricks and scandals. Partie, limo rides with celebrities, and jetting off to the island of St. Barts for Christmas vacation with a bunch of friends are just some of the antics Blair and Serena are up to so they can blow off some steam after midterms. On the wild beaches of St. Barts theres plenty of scandal and backstabbing as Blair flirts with her stepbrother Aaron's drummer friend Miles while Aaron is trying to suppress his feeling for Blair himself. Meanwhile Blair is still trying to write her Yale essay, based on who else but her idol Audrey Hepburn, even though she knows she been putting it off for way too long. After a botched Yale interview, the essay is extremely important if she wants a ticket to Yale. <br /> <br />The sophisticated Serena has got problems on her hands too, trying to fend off the affections of Flow,the sexy lead singer of the band Komunik8, whose got every girl at Constance Billard School drooling over him. When everyone returns to New York from St. Barts to attend Serena's party, things heat up between Blair and her ex-boyfriend Nate and his new girlfriend Jenny, whose only 14, but has got totally huge attributes in the chest area. Then theres Danny, Jenny's big brother, the romantic poet whose still trying to sort out with Vanessa the should we do it or not issue in their relationship. <br /> <br />All and all the 3rd book in the series was another worthy installment of guilty pleasure but I though the previous 2 were better. The plot lines were a bit choppy and not that intricately connected like the previous two. The characters have many new developments and the identity of Gossip Girl is becoming more interesting. A fan scandalous read that Idefinitely recommend.  <br /> <br />	2004-10-17

Blair been really insecure lately since her former best friend Serena van der Woodsen, just expelled from boarding school overseas, is back and Nate, and the whole male population, can't seem to take their eyes off Serena. Blair once again is becoming the sidekick, one of Serena's friends, out of the school's mainstream limelight. But Blair is going to fight back at Serena this time with all shes got. <br /> <br />Serena doesn't understand why every girl, especially Blair, is suddenly becoming so cold to her and spreading nasty rumors about her. However Serena has other problems to deal with. She has fallen terribly behind and if she doesn't pick herself up, Yale or Harvard is never going to accept her. So Serena decides to join the school play and unexpectantly the lead male actor is extremely cute, but unpopular. Throw in the fact that the director has a crush on the male actor and things are heating up. <br /> <br />Drink, eating disorders, insecurity, drug use, and profanity are just many parts of Gossip Girl that might make your parents have a heartattack, but the book itself is really wonderful and delicously full of gossip.

But birthday's aren't the only thing on Blair's mind. Blair has an interview at Yale coming up and her mother is getting married again, after a 2 month courtship, to Cyrus Rose, a man of the high society, who just happens to have a hot son named Aaron, a hippie. Worst of all, Blair's mom has chosen Blair's former best friend Serena as bridsmaid instead of Blair and of course such a big occasion must also catch the attention of Vogue, the magazine, who will be taking pictures at the wedding.  <br /> <br />Then there is Nate himself. Blairs been so busy with all the wedding and college applications that shes been too busy to see that Nate isn't exactly hers anymore. He has been secretly dating Jenny Humphrey, a ninth-grader, whose got some pretty good attributes in the chest area. Jenny's brother Danny, the romantic poet, is still swooning over Serena, whose busy with her interview with Brown.  <br /> <br />Bad languague, inapprapriate situations, makes Gossip Girl appropriate for only mature readers but once you get into them, you really can't put it down. The storylines are enticing and the scandals are just pure fun. The characters are great and there is never a dull moment. A definite must read if you want to catch up on some \\"gossip\\".  <br />	2004-10-16

She kept up well in her classes, except for some occasional mischief, and generally had some issues with her mother(You know the whole teen girl and mother conflict thingy we all experience). However Chloe's life is about to change forever. The day before her sweet sixteen, Chloe and her two best friends Amy and Paul decided to ditch school so they can visit San Francisco's Coit Tower, the highest tower in the city. In a split second Chloe's life changes when she falls from the tower and hits her head, except defying all odds, she isn't dead, she lives to tell about it. Surviving such a fall is impossible for a human and Chloe soon begins to develop unusual powers. When her two best friends begin dating, Chloe feels left out and begins to have an assortment of relationships with young men who seem really interested in her, to the point of prowling. That not all of Chloe's problems, she's growing claws, ones that a cat might possess and to top it off, someone is trying to kill her, or maybe a secret organization. Can Chloe's other eight lives save her from death? <br /> <br />I first came to know of this series from an excerpt of the book in Francine Pascal's Fearless series. Like the Fearless series, Celia Thompson develops a character who has supernatural powers and has someone after them. A good read for fans of teen fiction for sure, but the book has its weak points. However, I can't wait to read the next one.	2004-10-14

Back then I was in 5th grade. The still can hold my attention even now 5 years later. I recommend parents of young children to definitely let their kids read this series. Its a great way for children to start on chapter books and the pictures can keep your child's attention.	2004-10-11

Can they somehow outmuster Lord Sparr and save Droon? <br /> <br />This was one of my favorites in the series. Definitely quite entertaining with a few revelations.

They are cruel and brutal and nobody have better get in their way, adult or fellow student. Some girls, such as Myrna Fry makes it their life's goal to become part of the group so that they no longer get picked on and can start wreaking havoc. The school is truly a total nightmare until the arrival of the unfashional, and worst of all unwealthy poor girl Twyla Gay Stark. The school is about to tilt on its own axis when Jeanette's \\"man\\", or as she would like to put it her property, Ryder begins to have a relationship with the new gal. Uh oh.... <br /> <br />I am a fan of Francine Pascal's Fearless series and was really eager to read this book. I found it to be another very enjoyable teen book. The girls at times were a bit overly vicious but I bet many people can find similaries between Highland Park and their high school. You do feel for these girls, even Jeanette Sue. A definite recommendation.	2004-10-10

When the diary begins, Green Jay is preparing to make the long journey to Xukpi to meet the husband she has never met. Green Jay is sad because she knows that the long journey from Lakamha to Xukpi will likely mean that she will never return home. Her journey will be a treachrous one, as 749 Mesoamerica is not a peaceful time in Mayan history. Neighboring tribes are not on good terms with Lakamha and anything can happen. First her entourage of guardians and soldiers travel to Mutal, a allie of Lakahma where they rest for a few days. We get to see glimpses of the Mayan culture through their celebration. As the journey brings her more closer to Xukpi, Green Jay's anticipation of what her husband is like grows until the moment they finally meet. <br /> <br />This book is not as bad as some of the review here have portrayed it to be. I found it to have an okay storyline, though my interest did wane at some points and I had a hard time finishing the book. The names were quite hard to keep straight since they were so long and complicated. I had to check back to the glossory every few seconds to remind myself of who is who. I do believe this is the weakest Royal Diary so far but if you have some extra time on a boring day, this book might not be a bad read.	2004-10-05

Unfortunately sorrow soon follows as Angela records the loss of family and friends along with the terrible tragedy of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire where her sister works.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed this diary very much. It was probably one of the saddest Dear Americas out there but it really accurately described the situations in the factories. I recommend fans of Dear America to read this book.	2004-09-22

Granted it still isn't, but this one was at least better than the previous few. We finally get some new plot developments in every area: <br /> <br />Loki has officially returned. This time he is using Jake as his operative and things don't look too good. If Jake doesn't start doing things right and getting information, Loki might just do to Jake what he does to every operative that fails. <br /> <br />Gaia doesn't understand why she is so attracted to Skyler but she is. He seems to always know how to comfort her and with him her fear isn't that bad. Gaia totally erupts in anger when Jake tries to accuse Skyler of using Gaia and plotting against her. How could Jake suggest those things? Things are definitely changing in their relationship but that not the only big surprise. By accident Gaia realizes something: Her fearlessness has come back.(I was so glad with this development. Gaia with fear just isn't Gaia:) <br /> <br />Skyler thinks he has got all the cards. Gaia seems totally reliant on him and for once he seems to be God. Can he keep it up? <br /> <br />Sam and Heather once again are non-existent. The FOHs are still plotting to split Gaia and Jake, though they might not have to anymore since Gaia and Jake seem to have already broken themselves up. Ed is going with Kai to the prom, though he can't stop worrying about Gaia. <br /> <br />The last few chapters of the book were great. We finally get the old Gaia back!! The first few chapter, I could have done without. Hopefully the next book will be even better. Only 3 more left to go. I'm exited!	2004-09-18

The last few books have been totally boring, and the plot lines are just twisted versions of former ones. WIRED is pretty much a continuation of TERROR and gives little plot movement. <br /> <br />Gaia is still feeling fear. Not only is she worrying about the prom, but she wants very badly to fit in with the FOHs. Unfortunately the FOHs don't have Gaia's best interests in mind. They are hatching up a plan to get back at Gaia, who got invited to Liz Rodke's party instead of them..their target: Jake of course. Speaking of Jake, he and Gaia are still having problems. Jake doesn't understand why Gaias changed and Gaia doesn't seem to understand why Jake trusts Oliver so much. Their little romance is totally going downhill. <br /> <br />The Rodkes have a more intense role in this book. We begin to find out their real motives and the oldest, Skyler, is making Gaia feel all different inside. Could this be the start of something?  <br /> <br />It seems Francine has totally forgotten about half of the old characters. Sam and Heather have been axed. They are totally non-existent and probably will not return for the rest of the series considering the storyline. Ed doesn't get many pages either and his deadlocked relationship with Kai is a boring read.  <br /> <br />Very glad that Fearless is finally winding down. After 6 years we deserve to know what happens to Gaia. Unfortunately we should have known a long time ago.	2004-09-18

Not wanting to separate the two boys escape to Venice, a city their mother told them had magical lions and great canals.

After a series of events, Victor discovers their hiding place and many more surprising turns finally bring to light the true identity of The Thief Lord.<br />The Thief Lord is definitely a very enjoyable read. Unfornately a book that was suppose to be realistic was made into a part fantasy ending which didn't fit the book at all. Nothing in the whole booked suggested fantasy as being part of the book and the ending came totally out of the blue. If you get past the ending though you'll definitely enjoy this book that has is like a 21st century Dicken's novel.	2004-07-14

Not only is the Grim stirring up chaos in the House, but in Arthur's world too. The Grim's Grotesques, his seven ugly, mishapen servants, are up to no good and Arthur's family is on the verge of a financial crisis. So once again Arthur must return to The House and retrieve the Second Key from Grim Tuesday to save everybody. Soon he finds himself a worker in the Grim's Pit and befriends Japeth, a Denizen that talks like a thesaurous. Of course Suzy is also there to help, after being sent by the Will to assist Arthur. Soon Suzy and Arthur find themselves battling Nithilings, stealing a Sunship, harpooing sunsprites, and trying to knock some senses into the Second Clause of the Will, which is in a bear form. Of course everything leads to the final showdown with the Grim, but unlike Monday, this won't be a contest of strength and swords, but creativity. <br />The second book in this series was a definite improvement over the first one. Japeth provided some much needed comic relief and Soot was just funny. I also loved Tom, and I definitely hope he returns again. Oh, and the bear was a definite improvement over the previous Clause of the Will. Overall much better than the first one. I can't wait to read Drowned Wednesday and meet Lady Wednesday!

After reading the first chapter of this book, I knew that I wouldn't be disappointed as it just sucks you in. I found this book to be more darker than Garth Nix's past stories, but you can definitely tell his unique writing style. His story structure carries over and you can pinpoint many similarties with this book and his other works. Arthur is a great protagonist, though he lacks the charm of Sabriel and Tal from Garth Nix's previous books. I definitely recommend reading this book, though I feel it is a touch lower than Garth Nix's Sabriel and Seventh Tower.	2004-05-24

But boy was I wrong...<br />We catch up with Mia almost at the end of the school year. Of course things are now definitely clicking better than the beginning of the year. She is going to become a big sister and has just gotten a job on the newspaper \\"The Atom\\", even if it is the lowly position of reporting the school's lunch menu for the week. (Just as a side note : I loved the issues of \\"The Atom\\" in this book! Wish there had been more. They were so light-hearted and fun to read). But the best thing of all is that she has the world's greatest boyfriend, the love of her life, Micheal and it is Mia's dream of a lifetime to go the the school Prom with Micheal and spend an evening with him and hopefully getting to \\"second base\\". Unfortuntely things go all wrong before they do right. A diaster at Mia's 15th birthday party has caused the whole city's busboys to go on strike and now both Grandmere and Lily are in a deadlocked battle against eachother because of it. If things don't get settled soon, there might be no prom at all. But most importanty, the BIGGEST problem is that Micheal thinks the Prom is LAME!!! LAME!! Can Mia work some magic so her dream comes true? Or will she have to spend all her life regretting that she never went to the Prom with her love?<br />Okay, okay, enough with telling what happens. Now onto my opinion of the book. Like always, Mia made me laugh with all the idiot things she keeps coming up with. Being the same age as Mia herself, I can relate to some of those lame teen things everybody goes through. But my favorite part was when Mia thought she had Asperger's syndrome. So why didn't I give this book 5 stars? Because Mia obsessed way too much about the prom! Every other thought of hers was HOW AM I GOING TO GO TO THE PROM or WHY HASN'T MICHEAL ASKED ME TO THE PROM. Way too repetetive. Besides that, this book wasa vast improvement over #4, and I can say that Mia is officially back, bright and bubbly.	2004-05-02

This new Gaia screams at a cockroach, is afraid of a Doberman, is constantly paranoid of herself, and is wanting to \\"fit in\\". For the first time we see Gaia caring about her appearance and come on, it just has to be hilarious to read about a \\"blond Gaia\\" and her episode with shaving. But this new Gaia hasn't all been good. Her newfound paranoia and jealousy has caused rifts with her relationships with Jake. Plus I think this whole fear thing has clogged Gaia's judgment. How could she avoid all those warnings from Oliver? <br />Jake isn't sure if he likes this new Gaia or not. For one he fell in love with her because of her independence and toughness. The good thing is they finally had their conversation, but Gaia is reminding him more and more like a vulnerable girl, and Jake isn't too keen on dating more girls like that. <br />Ed is still recovering in the hospital. This is the one part of the book that I think Francine did not give enough justice to. When was the last time Ed was only mention in one chapter of the book? And yes, I am still an Ed and Gaia believer. <br />The FOHs are back to their plotting selves again, and this time their target is Gaia. There must be something special about her since she seems to snag all the hot guys!<br />Not much new plots happened in this book. Pretty much a continuation of 31. The ending was a semi-cliffhanger that makes you want to read the next book desperately. As for my opinions of this new Gaia, I dunno. The reason I loved Gaia was because of her kick-ass attitude. This new girl is a bit scary at times but maybe I'm just getting used to her.	2004-04-28

These 800+ words not only help you do good on standardized tests but also enrich your vocabulary for everyday conversations. I especially found the pronunciation keys for every word very useful. It doesn't really make you look very smart if you mispronounce a word does it? I found it really funny that books never gave you pronunciations and was so pleased when I finally saw them in Word Smart. The sentence examples are also a great way to learn how to use these words and Adam's humor definitely shows up in some of them:) The word root list and GRE hit parade were also very helpful.<br />I recently got a score of 700 on my verbal section of the SATs. A large part of the reason was Word Smart. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because I feel that you need to also purchase Word Smart II to get all the words that you absolutely need to know for the SATs. There are also some words in this book that are way too easy. Come on, ironic? Who doesn't know what that means. Otherwise this book is a must-buy for anyone taking the SATs.	2004-04-22

It is 1501, and young Catherine of Spain is betrothed to Arthur, the heir to England's throne. She begins by writing of a her journey to England. What was to be a great union of two powers was not to be as Catherine describes her utter loneliness in the English court. Arthur is very sickly and unable to perform the duties of a husband to Catherine. Six mothes after marriage, Arthur dies, and Catherine's fate is thrown up in the air as Spain and England dispute the outcome. There are rumors that she will return to Spain, and also rumors that she will marry Henry. Catherine's life is thrown into chaos for the next 7 years, and she lives through a time of poverty while the two kingdoms fight over her drowry. Through it all Catherine is determined to become Queen of England one day. During this time she comes into acquaintence with Henry, Arthur's younger brother. Catherine takes a liking to Henry and in the end, she does marry Henry and become England's Queen, though quickly the happiness fades. This was another wonderful book in the Young Royals series. Catherine painted a very vivid image of her life in the English court and her feelings toward Arthur and Henry. Fans should definitely also read Mary, Bloody Mary, about Catherine's daughter, and Doomed Queen Anne, about Anne Boleyn, the woman who ultimately stole Henry's heart from Catherine.	2004-04-22

From how to eat, talk, stand, make an incredible entrance, or how to wear a tiara, Mia creates another funny page-turner with these hiliarious questions of what makes a perfect princess. From old princesses, young princesses, real princesses, to fiction princesses, Mia analyzes how each exhibits the sings of a true princess. My favorite had to be WuZeTian(I'm Asian and Chinese). Couldn't believe she was in there. Mia just about covered every princess I could ever think about.<br />Like Princess Lessons this book should probably only be read by true Princess Diaries fans.(I did find it slightly better than Princess Lessons) I really enjoyed it, though I could tell if someone would find it kinda boring if they weren't a true fan. You don't have to read this book to get the series since nothing is connected. It is just a fun book for those of us who dream of becoming princesses one day.	2004-04-14

Her mother is pregnant again and the whole family prays for a son, because they know the strict rules of 2 children per family would not permit them to have another child if the baby turned out to be a girl. Unfortunately, Chu Ju's new sibling turns out to be another girl. Chu Ju's grandmother is very bitter at the result and convinces the family to put the girl up for adoption and hopefully have another child that will be a boy. Chu Ju is devastated when she hears of her family's plan and she decides to run away so her baby sister will not have to suffer. Little does Chu Ju know how important this journey will be to her life and self-realization. Told over several years, Chu Ju's journey brings her many hardships, but joy as well. She goes from village to village finding an assortment of jobs, such as working on a silkfarm, a fishing boat, and working in the rice paddies. In the end, Chu Ju realizes she made the right decision and you know she will be happy since she has found her true love and a family that accepts her for who she is and not her gender.<br />Being a 2nd-generation Asian-American this book hit very close to home. Unfortunately this type of gender discrimination is very common in many of China's rural villages which still go by old customs and have not been educated in the new modern ways. This topic was probably very tough to write on, but I think Gloria Whelan did a great job touching on both sides of the issue. Like Homeless Bird, she has created another great story of a girl who had courage to face the odds.	2004-04-13

The two share many adventures as both are in the 5th grade. They have many new experiences including celebrating the various \\"new\\" American holidays.

Like the title suggests, this book centers around 14-year-old Weetamoo, oldest child and successor of sachem Corbitant. The book describes one year in her life and was depicted through many Native American legends. I especially enjoyed the story of Squant, a beautiful squared eyed young women Weetamoo prays to for patience and who appears to Weetamoo in a spiritual ritual fast. The book also describes Weetamoo's interactions and feelings toward the \\"Coat-Men\\", the English of the Plymouth Colony. As the story passes, Weetamoo has many life changing experiences such as her ritual fast in which she see clues to her future, and she finds her love whom she believes will be her husband one day. <br />I really did enjoy this book, though it was not one of my favorites of the Royal Diaries. It is nice to know that there are more Native American women other than Pocohantas or Scajawea who stood up for their beliefs. Though in the end Weetamoo and her people did not triumph, their culture is very much alive in the US today, and I really recommend people to read this book to develop an understanding of them.	2004-02-10

This time things are very different. We as the readers have no clue who is now after Gaia, unlike previously when everybody know it was Loki, and then Yuri. This time we are totally in the dark and Gaia is in more danger than ever. Francine also gave the plot line some punch with the fact that Oliver is starting to return to his Loki ways and reassembled his \\"team\\". There are also two new characters, \\"the queen of toothpaste\\", Liz and her gay brother Chris, new super rich students who begin to attend Gaia's school, whom befriend Gaia. (I personally suspect they are up to no good). The HUGE cliffhanger ending at the end literally drove me mad. I can't wait to find out what happens between Gaia/Ed/Jake/Kai. Lets just say things are definitely gonna change.	2004-02-09

Who will now make the dress Kathleen so desires and where will the money come from? It seems impossible, but when one thing leads to another Kathleen finds herself flying across the stage in her first contest. This was another great Girls of Many Lands book.

But it seems he has dropped out of the \\"Gaia loop\\" and Jake is now in...<br />FREAK was a pretty decent book in the series. It had quite a few revelations and explained a great deal. I love the fact that Tom, Gaia, and Oliver can now be a family. However, Jake/Gaia bothers me somewhat. Their relationship lackes the spark of Sam/Gaia and Ed/Gaia. It was also quite disappointing that Ed was almost nonexistant in this book. He was the one that saved Gaia so many times and I kinda feel sad that Gaia has now forgotten all about him and gotten together with Jake to live her \\"new life\\". Well, I can't wait to read the next book and can't wait for the new series coming out on the WB.	2003-11-14

It is there that Saba finally learns of her true identity. At first, Saba, keenly unaware of the dangers of the court, can only delight in her new found surroundings. Unfortuantely, innocence can not last forever, and she learns of a deadly threat to her and her brother...one that threatens their very lives and freedom. Yet, Saba is determined to use her wits to save her and her brother from the treacherous inner working of the court.<br />I was very much fascinated with this book for it was one of the very few books that talks about the Ethopia royal family in any great detail. Saba is a strong first-person narrator and you will enjoy her way of expressing herself. A definite must-read.	2003-10-29

Unfortunately Artemis doesn't count on the operation being a total failure. When Artemis meets with American buisnessman Jon Spiro all Artemis wanted to do was trick Spiro into losing some big bucks over the \\"C Cube\\", a mixture of human and faerie technology way ahead of our time, a technology that will literally cause all of Spiro's enterprises to become ancient history. Instead of intimidating Spiro, Artemis is set up and Spiro steals the C-Cube while fatally wounding Butler in the process. Artemis is once again forced to enlist the help of his less than happy faerie friends. So once again we are off in another new adventure with Holly Short, Foaly, Commander Root, and of course Mulch Diggins.<br />Eoin Colfer just keeps getting better and better. This book kept you on your toes and the more involved role of Juliet Butler was definitely a welcoming surprise. In this book, Colfer shows us his great logic and humor as a writer. The ending was fitting though I will seriously miss Artemis, he just kept getting better and better. I am definitely hoping that Colfer will change his mind and write a fourth book. The ending definitely suggest more adventures in the future. Anyway more books or not, Artemis has definitely sealed his legacy in the book world.	2003-10-15

I am really beginning to wonder if that is the final straw in Ed and Gaia's relationship. The pretty new character Jake is confusing me. You expect him to be an agent for Loki, yet at times he is actrually pretty cute. Of course I am all against him and Gaia. Dimitri the new character is also very suspicious...but the one singular thing that surprised me so much was Sam's actions at the end.

At this time in history Green Marsh is a very dangerous place for Loyalists for many support George Washington and the Patriots. As each day passes Pru fears for her family's safety and each day adds sadness because she and Abigail are no longer close because of political differences. Soon it becomes clear that Pru's family must leave their beloved home and flee to Boston for safety...I had always wished to read a book from the view of a Tory, instead of from a Patriot. I must say that this book was excently written and gave a good perspective of the other side of the Revolutionary War. The Patriots were not the only side that suffered, the Tories did too.	2003-04-18

I guess I should have expected Francine to add this twist but Ed and Gaia were SO perfect together. Why did she have to bring Sam back and add more stuff to this complicated mess?? It doesn't help that Gaia stood Ed up just for Sam. I really don't want Sam and Gaia to get back anymore. I used to like the idea. When Sam first died it was like a bomb had dropped, and now that he is suddenly back alive I don't know what to think anymore. It doesn't help that Gaia is keeping Sam's return a secret from Ed. I can just see the breakup coming. The new character Jake is also a mystery. He is probably a replacement for the dead Josh. It seems whenever the series starts getting better a new twist just has to happen and once again we are strung into Gaia's messed up life again. Plus Natasha and Tiatiana are starting to act suspicious again and I'm screaming my head off because I don't need another George to pop up again. The ending was yet another cliffhanger and once again I can't wait to find out what happens next. Unfortunately Sam's return has really messed thing up. Why did he have to come back?

Unfortunately when they arrive in New York they learn that Jonathan and the others had just left to go to Long Island for a few days. Can Mandie stand the suspense?<br />This new Mandie book I felt wasn't as good as the others, but I'm sure the next book Mandie and the Night Thief will be much better as Mandie and her friends go to visit the Pattons. Of course the animosity between Senator Morton and Lindall Guyer will be fun to watch. As Jonathan said:\\"May the best man win!\\"	2003-01-20

The horrors of the past have just become plain history and is featured in a documentary that history teacher Ben Ross will show his class. After the viewing of the documentary though, Ben is pounded with questions on why German people could have let that happen...a question to which he has no anwser for. That nagging question haunts Mr. Ross and he comes up with an experient for his senior history class called \\"The Wave.\\" A movement with the mottos \\"Strength Through Discipline\\", Strength Through Community, and Strenght Through Action\\". Soon The Wave becomes more than an experiment but a fad that takes the whole school by storm. Everybody feels The Wave is uniting people together like equals but only Laurie Saunders can see the dark, menacing side of The Wave...Will history repeat itself?<br />This was based on a true story that happened in California. I was really surprised something like this could have happened again after WWII. It was a definite awaking. This book overall was okay. There wasn't a very interesting plot and the ending was as predictable as ever, though that wasn't the authors fault. All true stories have those problems. I still recommend teens to read it though.	2003-01-15

Agnes decides to return to the Mohawk Indian reservation where she could get advice from her aunt, also a healer. Soon she goes on a powerful vision quest that will conclude Mary's story, the story of a girl who beat all odds and used her special powers to become a healer.<br />This was a fitting ending to Witch Child. Mary's ending wasn't exactly how I expected it to be but it was nice to find out about all the other people at Beluh and how the quilt where the original diary was found got to the museum.

From the time she was born, Anne had been the dark sheep of her family. Not only did she have a sixth finger, but she also had a black mole. Anne had neither the beauty of her older sister Mary, or the importance of her younger brother George. But with an ambition as high as the mountains, Anne vowed one day that her sister, Mary, the King's mistress, will one day kneel at her feet. As a lady-in-waiting to Queen Catherine in Henry's court, Anne finally begins to see her wish coming true when she finally catches Henry's eyes. Though Anne knows Henry loves her, she knows that is not enough. The people's overall hatred of her and loyalty to Queen Catherine might ultimately be her downfall. When finally she bears Henry's child, she is finally declared Queen, a title she had vied for so many years. Only one nagging issue is  in the back of her mind: What if the child isn't a son? What if she fails Henry's ultimate wish to have a male heir? What would become of her...<br />This new edition to the Young Royals series has to be my favorite. It was quite accurate and Anne was potrayed perfectly as a girl who just wanted to prove herself worthwhile to a world that shut her out. To many Anne was the ulimate symbol of evil, but after reading this book, my opinion of her changed. She was in a tough position, but ulimately her big ambitions was also her downfall. <br />This book definitely will be more fitting for older readers. Doomed Queen Anne also probably appeals to an older audience than the previous two books. Definitely a great book to add to your collection.	2002-11-16

Kaya knows that if Brown Deer marries Cut Creek, she will have to leave them. Will Kaya come up with some plans so she won't be losing both her sisters at once? I felt that this book could have been better. When they introduced this book they said there would be a lot of festivites for the Nez Perce during the summer. Unfortunately so much time was spent on Kaya trying to solve her family problems, that nothing really fun was mentioned. I was really hoping to see how Nez Perce celebrated the arrival of summer. There wasn't that much mention of Two Hawks either which disappointed me a bit. Still this is a good book to add to your collection.	2002-11-11

Some of those expectations were met, like always Lasky described very well the court life of India. Unfortunately I felt this book was really lacking a center plot. Too many things were going on and Lasky never really established a plot. It is still a very good book about India though.	2002-10-12

Being the only child of an U.S. Calvary officer she is the only reminder to her father of her dead mother. You can say Miranda is a bit naive, for after repeated warnings, and living on the frontier, Miranda never believed there was much danger to the news of Cheyenne raids, that is until she herself is captured by a Cheyenne warrior named Shadow Walker. Shadow Walker is a respected warrior to the Cheyenne and after his uncle got captured in a raid he was out to revenge and was quite disappointed to find that he had only managed to capture a worthless girl. Soon though he begins to realize this isn't one normal girl, but a defiant one as she rebels against him any chance she has. Frustrated, Shadow Walker begins her into the wilderness of the forest to teach her lessons. Little are both prepared for the feelings that will surface between the two of them. I felt that this is probably one of the weakest Avon True Romances. It is still a nice book to sit down and read.	2002-10-05

So he does the one thing he could ever do for the woman he loves, except the stakes are high and he know he will pay with his life...<br />Wow, this was a definite improvement on the recent fearless books. Definitely this story arc is coming to an end and the cliffhanger ending starts a whole new story arc which is defintely going to bring its ups and downs. I can't wait for the next edition Betrayed. This ending to this book was so unexpected it caught me by total surprise but will definitely bring more interesting plots in the next few editions. This book definitely brought back some excitement in the series!	2002-09-28

It perfectly brings the new and old generations of Star Wars fans together and makes a great continuation of Vector Prime. Though, this isn't my favorite book in the series, it did have some well described action scenes. I don't think this book, though, quite gave me the edge of the seat effect other Stars Wars books do though and for some reason this book just didn't have that much juice to it. Still, I do recommend this book to Star Wars fans all over our wide galaxy.	2002-09-20

That is until the day came when she slammed into her tree and lost her sight forever. For Bess suddenly the whole world had just changed in a split second. An avid diary writer since seven, Bess finds now that she must rely on her twin sister Elin to right entries for her. At first all Bess wants to do is hide from the world, shut herself in a room. But her family wouldn't let her give up on herself and sent her to the Perkins School for the blind. Bess slowly begins to regain her confidence as she finds herself surrounded by people who are much like her, blind and also struggle to grasp the concept of Braille, language for the blind. This unique diary takes you into the life of a girl who is very couragous and I really liked it because it was a fresh new idea from Dear America, the first of its kind. It was also nice to learn about Perkins, where Hellen Keller went to school. All and all another hit from Dear America.	2002-09-08

Sixteen-year-old Anna Becker's life had spun out of control when her beloved grandfather died, still clutching the tickets for the Hindenburg to America. Now she'd be lucky if she can get out of the strong clutches of her brother Kurt, before he marries her off, and she surrenders her freedon forever to Nazi Germany's rules. When she is finally able to outsmart her brother, young Anna begins her daring escape to America on the doomed Hindenburg and on the way meets a young, mysterious man named Erik Peterson, who offers instant safety and maybe something more...then her world comes to a crashing halt when she meets the man who tore her heart to pieces, a man she swore to forget forever, Karl Mueller, the man she used to love, who Erik says is now a Nazi spy. Soon Anna finds herself torn between the two men, one who promises new love, and one who probably holds her heart as well as her future in his very hands. Soon Anna finds that is it more than her conscience, but her heart too that will help her make the right decision.<br />Wow! This was such a great love story movie. It would make the most romantic love story. Even though we knew that the Hindenburg was doomed this story brought the accident into a whole new light. The tragic ending was so sad it made me cry, but I think it was a fitting ending to the story. Just a beautiful book everyone should read.	2002-08-20

Things change though when Mandie's Cherokee friend Uncle Ned shows up with the quilt Mandie found in the attic, with the mysterious message. He had promised Mandie he would ask Uncle Wirt what it meant but now Uncle Ned refuses to tell Mandie what it means, saying that it is a bad,sad message. Of course it stirs up the couriosity juices in Mandie, and she changes her plans and decides to go see her Cherokee people first, to find out what the message on the quilt means, instead of visiting Jonathan first. Just when Mandie and her friends get settled down the quilt mysteriously disappears! Who could have taken yet? Can it be connected to the disappearence, once again, of Mandie's cousin T'sani, who is a noctorious troublemaker? Will they ever find out what the message means? Read to find out!<br />This, as usual, was another wonderful Mandie book. I have been reading them since I was 9 and it has been 4 years since I have started and they are still as good as the first ones. I can't wait for the next installment called Mandie and the New York Secret. It looks like it will reveal why Mrs. Taft and Jonathan's father don't have a very good relationship...something from the past caused the rift and what is it? I can't wait to find out!	2002-08-15

The Jedi Council decides to give him and Master Obi-Wan Kenobi their first mission to hold some of Anakin's loose energy. Their mission: to go to the little know rogue planet, Zonoma Sekot, the source of the fastest planes in the universe, to search for a lost Jedi Vegere. Soon the two find the planet isn't all it seems as the two are swept up into deadly intrigue that will threaten their relationship and show Anakin his most darkest side. <br />I was sure the combination of George Bear and Star Wars would work out but not really. This book was pretty confusing at times and just not that good. I would recommend \\"The Approaching Storm\\" besides this. I did like seeing the beginning of Anakin's dark side and the fact that they introduced the character Vegere who will have a more interesting role in the New Jedi Order series.	2002-08-14

When I heard that the sequel of Artemis Fowl was coming out I was very excited and got the book the first day it was published, though I have been too lazy to write a review until now. I must say, I LOVED this book much more than the first one and will definitely give Harry Potter a run for its money. <br />This whole new adventure of Artemis Fowl's starts with him at an Ireland boarding school when suddenly out of the blue he receives an urgent video email from a person he thought he would never ever see again in his life---his father, Artemis Fowl Sr. It turns out after his ship the \\"Fowl Star\\" sank in the arctic ocean, Artemis Fowl Sr. was kidnapped by the Russian Mafiya. (Intersting huh?) As Artemis rushes to save his father, he is once again stopped in his tracks by a familiar foe, LEPrecon fairy police, Holly Short. This time though Artemis isn't going to work against them, but must enlist in their help to track down and save his father. Of course, things aren't going to be easy, as a betrayer in the LEPrecon fairy police, must once again call Atemis' brilliant mind to work. Artemis Fowl is definitely back and better than ever. I really liked to see the lighter side of Artemis Fowl and this book was another adventure full of magic, laugh-out-loud humor, and more importantly, heart.	2002-08-12

Disguising herself as a boy, and taking the name Rowan, she begins her daring journey into Sherwood Forest to track down her father. Soon she enlists the help of a band of followers, including Lionel, the cowardly giant, who has a gift with music, a runaway princess, and a half-wolf, half-dog. Together this strange pairing of people must survive the many perils of Sherwood Forest. However when Rowan gets the news that Robin Hood had been captured, can she gather up her courage to go and save him? Can she live up to her famous name?<br />I had high expectations for Nancy Springer's book Rowan and many of them were met, though not all. As always Nancy Springer weaves together a great fantasy tale, but somehow Rowan just doesn't pass to me as a heroine. This book is still good and I do recommend people who enjoy fantasy to read it.	2002-08-12

So thus their adventure begins, one that can only happen in the land of Droon!<br />I have been reading Droon books for quite awhile and even though they are out of my age group, I must say, I really really enjoy them. The magical world of Droon will suck you in and every book invites you go through the door in Eric's basement and walk the staircase to another world!

For Jane things couldn't be better now that she is a lady, and when her childhood crush, William Baldt, asks her to marry him and go to the Northwestern Territory, Jane consents, even against the wishes of her beloved father. Soon though, Jane begins to kinda regret her decision as she suffers seasickness, deals with the young, despicable, yet charming sailor Jehu Scudder, and sees her companion Mary die in a storm. Jane knows, however, that William will be waiting for her and she perseveres. Unfortunately when she arrives, she learns that Willliam won't be back for months after he was sent on a mission by the Governor. Soon Jane learns that the wilderness life is quite unsuitable for her ladylike ways, and she finds herself going back to her old ways, the person she truly is. In just a few short monthes Jane has had as many adventures as we might have in a lifetime, from forage for salmonberries, almost drowning, sharing a cabin with flea-bitten, dirty men, and the one thing that Jane fears the most: her growing relationship with the young sailor Jehu Scudder. Her mind tells her though that she must stay loyal to William, even though her heart says something else, so she rejects Jehu, telling him she has no choice. The hurt Jehu leaves the settlement and for the first time Jane feels very much alone...until finally William returns! However William has brought secrets back with him, and when Jane finally finds out the truth she learns how ignorant she was to her father's warning, but the thing that she regrets the most is telling Jehu she had no choice...<br />This is the first novel I have ever read by Jennifer L. Holm and I must say I have become a quick fan of her. Jane has the charm and wit that is hard to resist. It was also really fun to read how Jane reminded herself how to be a ladyand quoted alot from her etiquette book. I can't wait to read the new book in the Boston Jane trilogy: Boston Jane: Wilderness Days!	2002-08-07

For the first time Koly feels safe and realizes hope is one the horizon for her.<br />This was a wonderful book about modern India, written beautifully by Gloria Whelan.

Not wanting to go to jail, Sarah agrees to pose as a spy to investigate Rose Greenhow, who is thought to be a spy for the Rebels. What Sarah doesn't expect is the lies, love, betrayal, and intrigue that will come with this new, dangerous job.<br />I am a big fan of Ann Rinaldi, and though \\"Girl in Blue\\" I felt was not her best work, it was still a pretty good book. Though at times the book was a little slow going, especially during the time Sarah does her spy work, it is still one to be read.

It tells of Obi-Wan and Anakins daring mission on the planet Anison...<br />Anison is a very important planet to the Republic, but it is in danger of joining the secessionist movement. Because of Ansion's many treaties, if it seceeds, many others will also follow. The urban dewellers on Anison are tired of the constant control of the Republic, wanting to expand into the prairies outside the cities, but always stopped by the Ansion nomads and the constant rules of the Republic. If their demands are not met they will secede---and the already fragile Republic will weaken even more. To keep the peace the Jedi Council sends two Jedi Knights, Obi-Wan and Luminara Unduli(you've got it! she is a lady! YEAH!) along with their two Padawan learners Anakin and Barriss to settle the conflict and hopefully sign a peace treaty between the two conflicting sides. As the Jedi soon find out, their journey won't be easy... Not only are natural diasters in their way---there are man-made ones as well---for someone wants their mission to fail...<br />I really did enjoy this book by my longtime favorite Alan Dean Foster. I wish I could give it 5 stars but there were some glaring weaknesses. For one, I thought at times there was too much detail in one area and too little in places that needed more. The action scenes(what little there was) were not really well described. On the other hand there were pages describing different nomadic tribes the Jedi come upon in their journey. The first time it was actrully nice to read about the tribes, but by the second and third time it just became a total waste of time and paper, which made the story slow going. Othewise I really did enjoy this book. Probably my favorite part of this book was that there were actrully female Jedi(Luminara and Barriss). The two happen to be my favorite characters in this book. They truly bring a whole new atmosphere to this book. The Approaching Storm is definitely a worthy edition to Star Wars.	2002-08-01

Two: The murderer shows up too and threatnes them to give him $200,000 dollars or else. Deperate the four teens go back to school and devise a plan with the help of Mackenzie and Hobson to catch the thieves with their own game. <br />I first got interested in these books after reading the excerpt in Payback: Fingerprints #7, another series I love. I must say this series was no disappointment. Though it had some weird humor it was still satisfying to read. You wish all the characters are real, even Allison! My favorite character has got to be Noah, though Mackenzie is a close second. I recommend everyone to read this trilogy as Daniel Parker's way of writing is perfect in a weird way.

Soon weird things start happening at Wessex starting with Tony Viverito, no other than Salvatore's brother, getting expelled from Wessex because he had chewing tabacco in his bookbag. The problem is Tony never chews tabacco and all fingers point to Fred Wright who does. Fred knows some conspiracy is going on at Wessex and he and Sunday decide to investigate. What they find out will surprise them both. This book was definitely better than I thought it would be. It was a little wierd but also very funny to read. It'll crack you up, I am sure. The cliffhanger ending makes you want the 2nd book even more!	2002-07-23

The young Nicola is very much ready for her first London Season and there is one thing she doesn't have to worry about and that is chosing a husband. Her choice has already been made: a handsome viscount known to Nicola as the \\"God\\" Lord Sebastian Bartholomew. Nicola is sure that she made the right choice. It was love at first sight and both have the same love of poetry. Things, however, don't go as planned as the few coversations they have had weren't very successful, save the talk of poetry. Nicola still is sure everything will work out until her best friend Eleanor's brother, Nathaniel Sheridan, a recent Oxford graduate, begins to cast doubt on the Viscount's character. Nicola is furious with Nathaniel for saying, what she believes, false things about the Viscount, but as she begins to find out the truth, the Viscount might not be the only problem for Nicola. Her own heart and feelings might be the biggest of them all. I have always been a big fan of Meg Cabot, especially her Princess Diaries series, and this book was no exception. This book has to be my favorite so far in the Avon True Romance series and I recommend every girl who likes a sweet romance to read it. I can't wait for Meg's next Avon True Romance Victoria and the Rouge.	2002-07-23

Gaia couldn't wish for more and runs desperately to all the places Nikolai tells her to go, for more stories of the past... When the story finally begins it is 1983...<br />Tom(Tommy) and Oliver(Olly) are as close as twin brothers can be. Yeah they have their sibling rifts and Tom does envy Oliver for getting into the CIA first and always winning all their combat fights but thing are harmonious between the two. Lately though Oliver has been having problems cracking a code from the \\"Organization\\" a mysterious agency who would do anything for money and guess who cracks it? Tom. The biggest problem though isn't that, it is the fact that they both fall in love with the same Russian girl---Katia, a former journalist, now aspiring singer at the Bitter End NightClub, a girl running from her mysterious past in Russia. (To see the first interactions between Tom and Katia and Oliver and Katia were really cute, so childish) When Oliver finds out that Katia is really in love with Tom, he is outraged and feels betrayed by his twin brother and finds solice in drinking. The thing that pushes Oliver over the top is when Tom takes over his job at the code-breaking department of the CIA. As their misunderstandings grow Oliver feels more betrayed and when a mysterious man from the Organization named Nikolai, offers Oliver help in gettting Katia back, Oliver accepts... Thus all the hurt and betrayal begin until Gaia is born---a new hope---a girl with outstanding powers, whom Tom and Katia hope will finally stop the civil war in the family. There is however one problem with Gaia, whose daughter is she? Tom or Oliver's?<br />This book made some big revelations and its unique style was quite intriging to read. I am so happythat we finally know what happened and who betrayed who. We also know who truly is Gaia's father. A new enemy of Gaia's is also introduce, actrully I'm not sure if he is enemy or foe for he is one of Gaia's closest remaining relatives---a man from Katia's past---the very reason she feld from Russia. This book is a definite must-read. I don't think you will get further installments of Fearless unless you read this book.	2002-07-18

Told myself that Francine will somehow bring back the excitement in this series, which has pretty much disappeared since book #20. Unfortunately what I got was some more frustrating story lines. Gaia is still avoiding Ed. Nothing new there. All we hear is how she want to be with Ed but can't(very repetitive) Now she is trying to see who is leaking information about her father to Loki. George, her friend and former CIA agent tells her it is Natasha, her new foster mom. Gaia definitely believes him, there is evidence. But Tatiana, Natasha's daughter is out to prove otherwise. As the two of them work together to uncover the truth, a relationship forms between the two of them and each learns something new about the other(of course we know that this friendship will most likely not last, just like Gaia and Heather's short friendship didn't either) When the traitor is finally revealed you won't believe who it is. It makes you want to scream because it another stupid storyline that Francine is throwing at us once again!<br />Another disappointment was that there was no advance in the Tatiana-Ed-Gaia love triangle. Yeah, Ed has been avoiding Tatiana at all cost so they don't have to discuss the \\"kiss\\" they had in the park. One good part is Ed finally gets to walk without his crutches(Yeah!!), after encouragement from his new physical therapist, Lydia, who is kinda a suspicious character. Still Ed and Gaia didn't even have really much conversation in this book and the most interesting storyline, the love triangle, had little to no mention at all!!!<br />Another total change of character is with Josh(You know characters can't just go from evil to good like this so it is totally frustrating!! It just seems that Francine makes these characters good when she needs them to be good and evil when she needs to kill off a character!!! He has totally changed from the character that killed Sam) Josh has now desperately fallen in love with Heather(UGH!!!!) However Loki wants him to give her the serum that will make her fearless, just like Gaia. Josh of course is undecided on the matter, as is Heather. He fears that once Heather takes the serum she will change to a person he doesn't know, one he doesn't love. Of course bother Josh and Heather make some stupid decisions and Heather does take the serum and the new Heather is very much different....(Why does Heather have to be so jealous of Gaia? COME ON!!!)<br />Lets just say my patience is wearing thin. Francine please end this series soon. Even if I am desperately hooked on this series the last few have dragged on and the 200 pages practically were a waste. Too much the same thing. When I actrully finished the book I thought did I really find out anything new? Isn't it pretty much like 21? Francine PLEASE just put some SENSE into Gaia. Get her and Ed together once and for all, kill Loki PLEASE!!!! Hopefully Fear is a lot better than Alone. It better be or I really will stop reading this series, even if it used to be my favorite series and I still want to know what happens.	2002-07-16

Gaia is STILL avoiding Ed, knowing that if she gets near to him, Loki, her evil uncle, might just kill him like every other person who ever got close to her. But this time Gaia is taking some action to change her fate. When her old foster father, George, a former CIA agent, comes to Gaia telling her that her that someone close to her father might be leaking information about him to Loki, and the main suspect is Natasha, Gaia decides to stay at her new foster home, and spy on her new family. Thus Gaia begins to set her trap for Loki...<br />Ed still can't figure out why Gaia just walked out of their relationship after the best night of their lives. All he knows is that he has to move on, even if he is still desperately in love with her. He begins spending more time with Tatiana, but the more time he spends with her, the more he thinks she is Gaia. He doesn't LOVE Tatiana, he just LIKES her as a friend, but Tatiana seems to think differently...<br />Heather is getting MORE obsessed with Josh.(UGH!!) But she is still very bothered by what Gaia said about Josh, that he is a KILLER. Of course, Josh comes up with the excuse that he used to date Gaia but then dumped her, and that is why Gaia is saying all this stupid stuff about him. Heather, of course believes him, and when Josh offers her a serum that can make her fearless, just like Gaia, will she accept?<br />Ugh, what can I say? I have been hooked on this series since the beginning but since Sex everything has gone downhill. I wish that Gaia would just get some sense into herself. She DESERVES some happiness here! The ending was quite exciting and I REALLY wish Gaia would just kill Loki once and for all. Even though I desperately love this series, I think the series should come to an end soon so it doesn't turn out to be a drag.	2002-07-11

Episode I: The Phantom Menace, the prequel to the original Star Wars Trilogy, tells of the beginning of the Sith, Dark Sidious's plan to topple the Republic and create the Dark Empire. The start of his plan begins with the Trade Federation's invasion of the small peaceful planet of Naboo, which Dark Sidious thinks will be very easy to take over, for the ruler is only a very young 14-year-old named Padme Amidala. However he is in for a surprise... When the two Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn, and his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, negotiations with the Trade Federation fail and Naboo is taken over by the Trade Federation the two Jedi rescue the young queen and try to escape to Corusanct, hoping the Senate would intervene. However mechanical problems cause them to have to land on Tatooine, a remote planet controled by the Hutts who are gangsters. There the Force brings them to a young boy named Anakin, we know the eventual Darth Vadar. It is herre that Padme and Anakin first meet and we know what happens later... Qui-Gon knows there is something special about the boy and when they are finally able to leave Tatooine he takes him with him to Corusant to have him trained as a Jedi and the long saga of Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vadar begins.  This was a superb beginning to what is to be 3 new movies-novels. I have always loved Patricia C. Wrede's writing style and this didn't disappoint. To see the first interactions with Anakin and Padme was just great. One not to be missed!	2002-07-08

Patrick writes of a trying time in our nation's history. He writes to his family often, knowing one day it could be his last letter. Known as \\"Mighty Mouse\\" by his fellow Marines, Patrick soon finds out that making friends isn't very easy in a war-zone, you lose them too quickly. The hot, steamy weather of Vietnam doesn't make things easier, as the hills are pounded everyday with mortars and rockets, but at least Patrick is in top physical shape being the star athlete on his football team back in Boston. When finally the Marines are rescued from their seige in Khe Sanh Patrick hopes for better times, but the horrors ahead of him are none that he could imagine. I think this was one of the best My Name Is America if not the best. This book, I felt, was a touch better than the companion diary of Patrick's sister, Molly, Where Have all the Flower's Gone, The Diary of Molly Mackenzie Flaherty. Both are quite well done though.	2002-07-01

Ten years after the events of the Phantom Menace, there are disturbances in the Force. The Republic continues to be corrupt even under the leadership of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. Now Separatists threaten to tear the Senate apart and start all out war and the Senate is hopelessly divided on the issue of whether to raise an army for battle or keep the peace. Young Senator Padme Amidala, former Queen of the Naboo, has come to Corusant to cast her crucial vote in this matter. After barely escaping an assasination on her life, the Jedi Council sends Obi-Wan Kenobi and his mischievous, but talented apprentice Anakin Skywalker to protect the Senator's life. A decade has passed since Anakin and Padme last crossed paths, but the years have not dimmed Anakin's feelings for the beautiful politicion. After another attempt is made on the Senator's life Obi-Wan Kenobi leaves to find the assasin and what he finds will shake the Jedi Council to its core. Meanwhile, Anakin is given his first mission, to protect the Senator. As he and Padme spend time alone with eachother, at the secluded Naboo lake resort, their fondness for eachother continue to grow in what is a forbidden romance. <br />R.A. Salvatore did a great job writing this book. I have seen the movie and I feel in many ways the book is better than the movie. There is definitely more character development. The romance has more detail to it, and it wasn't that bad to have extra chapters about Shmi Skywalker before she was kidnapped by the Tuskan Raiders, and Padme with her family. Of course seeing the book come alive at the movies is another whole new experience. R.A. Salvatore also did a great job with describing the action scenes too. A great book for all of us Star Wars fans!	2002-06-27

Susannah---Suze for short--- Simmon has just moved from her longtime home of New York City to the quiet town of Carmel, California to live with her new family which consists of, unfortunately, three new stepbrothers who Suze has nicknamed Sleepy, Dopey, and Doc. Besides that her new life is actrully pretty cool. That is until she finds a 150 year old hot ghost named Jesse living in her bedroom. You see, Suze is a mediator---a person who guards wayward souls back to their final resting places, wherever that might be. For Suze, this gift she has is more like a curse. But at least this new ghost who is sharing her bedroom is pretty attractive, not like Heather, the crazy ghost at her school who is out to revenge her own suicide. It looks to Suze like alittle talking isn't going to help getting Heather back where she should be...it is time for some action. This was a pretty thrilling beginning to the Mediator series. I didn't really expect Jenny Carroll to write a book like this but I do think this was a pretty good book. Coupled with some humor, and twist and turns that keep you guessing this book is definitely to be read.	2002-06-04

In fact it is one of my favorite Royal Diaries. It tells of 14-year-old Sondok, Princess of Silla, part of North Korea. However times are not well for her kingdom. Her father, King Chinp-yong of Silla, is constantly at war with 2 other kingdoms, Koguryo, and Paekche. The headstrong Sondok feels it is very immature of these three kingdoms to be constantly at war just for supremecy and their different views of three faiths, Shamanism, Buddhism, and Confucianism. For Sondok, as a girl, there are many limitations. She desperatly wants to study atronomy but her old fashioned grandmother refuses to let her. This book, like Lady of Chiao Kuo, shows a girl who lives in a region of civil war and who is smart to come to the rescue of her people. This is one of my favorite Royal Diaries.

From first sight I was surprised at how thin this book was and the huge print.( Kinda like a book for a seven-year-old) Then was disappointed me even more was that the initial interview was only about 2/3 of the book. Some of the facts in the interview was interesting but much to me was already known. It seemed to me throughout the entire interview J.K. was controling every little detail she let out. That is her character though. She never really ever revealed any of her plot line in her writing either.<br />The rest of the book was a complete overview of the Harry Potter series. This to me was a waste of time for I have read the books like 3 times each. And reader bewarned...if you haven't read all the Harry Potter books, this section holds a lot of spoilers which might ruin your experience.<br />All and all this book disappointed me very much. I hope someday J.K. decides to write a book about herself because billions of people are very interested in her life.	2002-03-22

Life there in France is pretty much every day life for Mary. She enjoys going to dances, and playing with her future husband Francis. But she loves hawking the best. However the charming Mary's life is made very difficult by the vicious jealous Queen Catherine de Medici. She finds confort though in Henry's mistress Diane de Poitier who was quite the lady and gave Mary strength and inspiration through good and bad times. <br />This was another ideal great Royal Diary. Like any other Royal Diary it had a part that explained the real history of Mary and it was sad to learn of her tragic ending. Like Francis said he and Mary were really chess pieces on a big chess board and a wrong move could ruin things.	2002-03-18

That wasn't the biggest one though. Let's just say when I opened it up I found the print to be HUGE. Another thing that disappointed me was from pg. 58 and on it was just an overview of the first 4 Harry Potter books. As a teen fan of Harry Potter and having read them many times I found it quite boring to have about 30 pages of just overview of things I already know. For a new fan of Harry Potter who hasn't read all the books it includes plenty of spoiler so I recommend you read the books first before you actrully read this interview book.<br />This book was split into three parts. The first part was called \\"An interview with J.K. Rowling. As enphasized on the cover this the first and only Authorized Biography of J.K. Rowling and I have found the little tidbids of information J.K. reveals to be disappointing. However that is the nature of J.K.'s character has she never reveals much about her story plotlines either. This first section of the book goes from pg. 11 to 57. It is split into four parts:<BR>1)My family and my childhood<BR>2)My school days<BR>3)My career<BR>4)My career as a writer<BR>These few pages were mostly all that was worth reading for me.<br />Part Two of this book was called \\"J.K. Rowling books\\" It was split into two parts:<BR>1)An overview<BR>2)The fourth book<BR>I recommend again not to read this part if you haven't read all the books yet because it does give out a lot of important storylines and spoiler. Of course it was boring for me because I've read the books many times<br />Part three of the book was just a bibiography and had a page of summery of the first 4 books. All and all this book only had 50 pages of HUGE print worth reading and I finished it in 40 minutes. As an teen fan of J.K. Rowling's I hope she writes a biography that tells more about her life than this after she finishes her seven Harry Potter books.	2002-03-18

However I am disappointed to say that I didn't like it as much as Angus. I found all the old character to be very enjoyable but I found Georgia in this book to have lost some of her spark and at times is really very self-centered and very inconsiderated of her best friend Jas. She is just flat out mean. However I stil anticipated futher adventures in her life in the next book coming out in May 2002 in the U.S. called Knocked Out by My Nunga-Nungas. It is already out in Britain. Hey but the American addition will have another fun glossary to read of all the word we American chums don't know about.	2002-03-03

Well, I think that this book was really very well written and had great imagination and magic in it...but it doesn't measure up to Harry Potter. I didn't feel the need to read on with this book as I did with Harry. Plus the plot lines are definitely very different. In this book 12 year old Artemis Fowl is a so called child genius. He and his sidekick/bodyguard Butler hatch a genius plan to steal some fairy gold so they can restore the Fowl dynasty. Well, Artemis made one big mistake by capturing Holly Short an LEP officer. Thus starts the battle of brains between the fairies and Artemis. Magic is throughout this book and I found the end to be very exciting and suspensful. I can't wait for Artemis Fowl: The Artic Incident...but this book did not measure up to Harry Potter. Even though it had great magic in this book the explanation for that magic at the end was kinda not what I expected. I wanted something much more creative. Something the so called genius Artemis would think up.	2002-01-28

Though it did have some parts on her childhood the things were very vague and gave you hardly any information. Half of this book was on Harry, and practically a lot of info in this book everybody already knows. It seems all J.K. ever really accomplished in her life were the Harry Potter books. The only reason I gave this book 2 stars is because it was informative on what J.K. is going to name her future Harry Potter books and some plot lines to number 5.	2002-01-24

This book focuses on Elizabeth's life after her father's death until she becomes queen. The young princess has to endure much such as spies all around her. The young princess knows she has slim hopes of ever being able to rein, being third in line for the succession of the throne. However Elizabeth proves everybody wrong by not only surviving her brother Edward's rule but also her evil sister Mary's rule and finally becomes queen. However the way to the throne was far from easy for Elizabeth. She had to endure the conspiraces after her dear brother's death and the execution of Lady Jane Grey, the queen of nine days, and she had to endure the stay in the Tower, locked away by Mary, who thinks she is going to try to take over the throne. Mary's spies are never far from Elizabeth and she has to live a life of danger everyday. Elizabeth knows, one day may be her last, if Mary doesn't trust her loyalty.<br />Caroyln Meyer succeded again in writing another great historical novel. I really like this book because it gave a different perspective into Elizabeth's life and how hard it was for her just to stay alive, and living each day with fear of execution. I highly recommend you read the companion to this book about Elizabeth's sister, Mary Tudor. The book is called &quot;Mary, Bloody Mary.	2002-01-18

What will her new life be like?<br />Though this book focuses on Louisa it also details Abby's lifestyle as the daugter of an abolitionist.<BR>Based on the true story of the capture of the Pearl in which 76 slaves attempted to escape to freedom Freedom Calls : Journey of a Slave Girl truly gives you new insight into the Civil times and the internal and external conflicts of that time. It also teaches that friendship is a loving bond. You can tell this book was well researched as the details were very descriptive. Though Louisa is fictional she could very well be real. This is a great book for researching that time period! I recommend all people to read this gripping new book, especially girls and fans of Dear America!	2002-01-08

However she isn't done with shocks yet. (...)<br />The second diary of Mia was another hit for me and should be for anyone who liked the first one. However I think the first one was just a tiny bit better than this one! I am just really attracted to Mia's sassy humor and all the normal teenage problems she gets.

Well, once again that Baily School Kids are out to save Baily City and this time in a ecological way too by cleaning Swamp Dread! However will cleaning be the only way to drive out Mr. Bunyip? Read to find out!!!<br />These Baily School Kids books are quite entertaining and still give me a few laughs. However these books are definitely getting more predictable and the plot lines are practically the same in all the books with just different monsters. I have been reading these books for 4 years and I still find them to be entertaining at times but I usually only read them if I have a lot of spare time. To sum it up: Still not a bad read for a cold dreary day!!! Especially would be good for little kids cause I think part of the reason I am not that interested in them anymore is because I am much older now!	2001-12-03

Such as her brother Charlie who worked in the CCC and earned money for the family. However Kit learns from Uncle Hendrick too! She could write a letter about all those kids who need clothing and shelter in the soup kitchen! So she, Ruthie, and Stirling go to the soup kitchen and took pictures of the poor condition the children were in.

In book the third the Baudelairs are taken by their lawyer Mr.Poe to live with Aunt Josephine at her house on the top of the mountain at Lake Lachrymose, home of the venomous Lachrymose Leeches. Aunt Josephine is scared of everything and expects diaster to always be around the corner.

Plus Aunt Josephine loves nothing more than grammar and constantly corrects the orphans mistakes. However Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are thankful that Count Olaf hasn't appeared in the quiet Lake Lachrymose yet. Their luck doesn't last long. It seems this time Count Olaf disguises himself as Captain Sham a sea captain!!! He totally fools Aunt Josephine but not the Baudelairs! Mysteriously Aunt Josephine seems to have commited suicide after a phone call to Captain Sham and has left the children under his care! Can the Baudelair orphans foil his evil plans once again?<br />I found this book to be very sad even though it was still hilirous. Lemony Snicket truly works his magic in these books.

This part just really fustrated me very much! I was expecting Rae and Athony's relationship to blossom! Things get even more fustrating when Yana seems to have gotten into her head that Rae is the one who sent a letter to her dad about the ballet story. Rae feels all alone and it doesn't make her feel better when it seems Anthony and Yana are hiding something from her. So when she gets a chance to find out about her mother more she goes by herself. However going by herself is definitely going to be dangerous. <br />This book was really fast-paced and as Rae finds out about her mother, unexpected truths about the group, her mother's powers, Amanda Reese, and a lot of stuff about herself. Metz definitely thickened the plot in this story. However the Rae and Anthony dilemma is really getting to be a pain. You just can't have tooooo many misunderstandings!

My parents bought the Harry Potter books for me as a Christmas present because they heard how popular the books were. I was hooked immediately!! This books are just great and J.K. truly works her magic in them. She has managed to bridge the generation gap with just these 4 books. I have to say it is not the books that are magical but it is J.K. with her magical wand that has united readers young and old together again. Hopefully critisism won't ruin the great things she has done with these books.<br />&quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; the first book in this series tells of Harry's first year at Hogwarts school. It begins when Harry as a baby is sent to live with his disgusting aunt,uncle, and cousin when he was just a baby after his parents were killed by an evil wizard. Harry grows up with no notion of being anything close to a wizard. All he know is that he is a worthless creep in the Dursley's eyes. However when he turns 11 he begins to see changes. Before he knows it he is wisked off to Hogwarts with the gamekeeper Hagrid. Thus his adventures begin. He quickly makes friends with Ron Weasly, and becomes the first first-year student to participate in Quidditch. I have to say my favorite aspects of this book was how J.K. imagined up Quidditch. Truly a work of magic. This first book totally blew me away and I read it in 3 hours.<br />Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets focuses on Harry's second year at Hogwarts. When Harry returns to the Dursley's during summer break he finds himself very not welcomed and confined to his room. Harry is more than happy to return to Hogwarts. However things at Hogwarts are not the same. The whole school is in cahoots when Finch's cat Mrs.Norris seems to have turned to stone. Harry, Ron, and Hermoine decide they have to investigate this mystery. However one day Hermoine seems to have found out something but is too mysteriously turned to stone. Soon more and more people suffer the same fate. However you won't believe who the number one suspect is, it is no other than Harry himself! This second book gripped me just as much as the first book. However for some reason I still like the first one better. The ending to this book is totally fantastic to read!<br />Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is one of my favorites so far. Before returing to school Harry is warned by a mysterious House Elf named Dobby that someone is out to get him at Hogwarts. So Harry goes to school having bad feelings about this new year. When he gets to school Harry learns the reason why everyone is uneasy. It seems Sirius Black an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he's after Harry Potter. His last words were &quot;he's at Hogwarts.&quot; Why? The ending to this book was really very creative and totally came as a surprise. I also love the new Defense of the Dark Arts Teacher Professor Lupin. Unfortunately he turned out to be a werewolf but that is another whole different aspect of this sorry. To sum it up this book was just truly magical!!! Another thing I liked about this book is that it offered new insights into Harry's past and his parent's past. This one was spectacular and the ending totally blew me away!!! This is probably the one I want to see the most if made into a movie.<br />Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire the fourth in the seven book series started out with a bang! Harry and his friend Ron decide to go to the Quidditch World Cup. However mysteriously the Dark Mark shows up. Everybody knows that is the sign of Lord Voldemart and Harry has had enough of that evil wizard for a life time. It was kind of disappointing to know there would be no Quidditch but I was totally excited to learn of the Triwizard Tournament. Hogwarts will vie with two other magicians' schools, the stylish Beauxbatons and the icy Durmstrang schools. Harry is mysteriously allowed to participate in the tournament even though he is underage. This leads to a whole new mystery finally leading up to the end when Harry finally has his confrontation with Lord Voldemart. The ending was kind of gory but I still thought it was justified. This fourth book totally blew me away again and even though it had 700 some pages the time just flew. Usually I would never read that long of a book!<br />The 2 year drought is almost over now because I heard Harry Potter number 5 is coming out early 2002. However J.K. has satisfied us with two Harry Potter school books which I highly recommend you read. The are very fun! The new released movie Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone should be another great see! Heard it was great! It seemed this two year drought hasn't been as bad as I thought it would be when I first heard it!! I can only say that I am going to be the first in line to see the movie and see the magic of J.K. come alive!!inally leading up to the end when Harry finally has his confrontation with Lord Voldemart.

However he isn't much help because he gets skittish around the village elder for their stupid rules. The good thing is that he keeps a secret inventing studio and a secret library( which by the way are against the rules in V.F.D.) for Violet and Klaus to enjoy.

The detective who comes to review the case is no other than Count Olaf in one of his new ridiculous diguises. And he accuses the kids of murder! Can the Baudlaires find a solution to their neverending series of unfortunate events? <br />This 7th book was totally genious by Lemony Snicket! It is one of my favorites. The 8th book which Ihave already read can be said to be even better. However let me warn you if you hate bad and unfortunate endings don't read these books!!!! Listen to the author's advice!	2001-10-28

Rose couldn't believe it back then. It was a dream come true! She couldn't wait to enjoy the pool and just party while recording her great experiences in her diary. However someone turned up dead that weekend and Rose's weekend was ruined. It turns out Angelica's dad's partner in law Frannie was murdered that weekend and he was the last one to see her. Four years later the police have reopened the case and to Rose's horror steal her diary in which she wrote her thoughts that weekend. To protect her family Rose steals the diary back. However it seems someone is out to get Rose. Whoever Rose is protecting doesn't seem to want her to protect them! Who could it be? <br />This book was kind of slow moving. I would recommend you borrow it at the library. I was sorely disappointed in Caroline's new book and I really didn't think the ending in this story sounded right.

Let me warn you before you pick up this book that after you read it it will change the aspect of this whole series. The shocking revelations stunned me to pieces.<br />First of all the shocking revelations on Tom's mission in Europe was exciting and shocking. Tom manages to foil Loki's plan thus stealing one of Loki's top secret disks. Inside he learns the shocking truth about what Loki has planned for Gaia. Let us just say it is pure EVIL!<br />The other shocking revelation was so sad I sobbed through the end of the book. This revelation has to do with Sam. He finds himself sinking deeper and deeper in Loki's organization and by trying to protect Gaia he loses her. Finally he comes face to face with the unthinkably evil Loki! The move at the end of the book with Sam's character was so sad! After this revelation I don't know what to think of what to come. I was never a big Sam fan but I still am not sure if the move by the author is really a good one. The only thing it signals is that the series is definetly coming to an end pretty soon. The only part in this book that wasn't very shocking is that Gaia is definetly getting more uncomfortable around Ed now that he has regained the use of his legs. I wonder how their relationship will turn with the sudden move of Sam's character. All I know is I can't wait to read #18 Love to find out!	2001-10-21

However there are more surprises to come but the most important thing I learned from this story and I know many of our grandparents and great-grandparents learned during the Great Depression, is that family love and bondage will make the worst situation seem ever slightly bearable. Kathryn Lasky is one of my favorite Dear America authors and her new book is one of the best in the series! I went away from this book being more thankful for the things I have.

The Bad Beginning, the first book in the &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; can be classifed as clever, dark, and funny. At the beginning of the book when the author says don't keep reading if you hate bad endings he is quite right. First the Baudelaire children get the most horrifying news from Mr. Poe, a guy who can't seem to stop coughing, that their parents had died in a horrible fire. They have a fortune but they learn the unfortunate news that they can't have it until the oldest Violet who is 14 becomes adult age. So their lawyer Mr. Poe takes the three children Violet, Klaus, and Sunny to the horrible guardian Count Olaf who will stop at nothing to get their fortune. The three orphans seem defensless against Count Olaf's evil plans as he traps Baby Sunny in the forbidden tower until Violet would marry him. However Count Olaf seems to have underestimated these smart children! <br />This book was really really funny. In many ways it has the humor and darkness of Harry Potter and even more. This is a great start to the books about the Baudlaire orphans but firsthand let me warn you: If you hate unhappy, unfortunate, bad ending stop reading now!	2001-10-19

As I already knew before Sam is falling more and more into Loki's organization and can't stand up to Josh. His and Gaia relationship has fallen apart. Lets just say their relationship broke up because the self-centered Sam can't stand Paul Moss(Mary's brother)who Gaia is hanging out with now since she moved in with the Mosses.

And she always seems to jump on a clue or something to solve it. You could say she is 160 of 160 in cases. I have read about 150 Nancy Drew books from the Nancy Drew files, Nancy Drew, and Nancy Drew on Campus. I find they are still good books to read in my pastime because there is still some mystery to them and most books keep you guessing.<br />In this installment of the forever lasting Nancy Drew series we have Nancy, Bess, and George going to New York City to visit the magnificent bird collection of the Van Hoogstraten family. The birds were supposidly done by Julius Van Hoogstraten the starter of thier empire. But as Nancy and her friends go to visit Dell Van Hoogstraten who is a friend of Nancy's Aunt Eloise things get out of hand as a crystal chandelier falls out of nowhere scaring the hell out of the guests. Things follow as the most prized peace of the collection the Crystal Dove is stolen. As  Nancy is trying to solve a mystery in the present she must dig deep into the past of Julius Van Hoogstraten to find the sinister serect. As we all know she came through again but this time guessing who did it wasn't that easy. Still a good read.	2001-08-13

The 3rd installment in the Harry Potter books is by far my favorite out of the first three. It went way beyond my expectationns in many ways. I couldn't put it down for a minute!<br />In this book we get to know the characters in this book a lot more better as now Harry is in his third year at Hogwarts. This year Harry learns about the cruel way his parents died, a lot more about Voldemart, who Sirius Black truly was, and the person who is hiding at Hogwarts. <br />This was really an exciting book to read and the ending is very inventive so people would probably never have guessed it. Hopefully Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire can match the intensity and fun in this book that makes you not want to put it down!	2001-08-08

Rowling did an excellent job writing the plot lines.<br />The story starts when Harry's parents are killed by You-Know-Who and Harry is made to live with his uncle, aunt, and the unbearable cousin Dudley. Harry lives a boring and horrible life as he is mistreated by his relatives. Everything however gets much more interesting on Harry's 11th birthday as everthing seems to be out of ordinary.

Sometimes it is very frustrating reading this book because you want the kids so much to tell the teachers what thy have discovered so they don't get into danger but it is impossible.

However when Morwen learns that the magic in the enchanted forest is disappearing and King Mendenbar's sword has been stolen she is determined to get it back. With much protesting from Mendenbar they finally decide who goes.

As if their quest isn't hard enough they encounter a fire witch, mud, vines that want to eat them, and the all too familiar wizards society.(Need more lemon juice?) Can they get the sword back in time to save the Enchanted Forest and Mendenbar? A cliffhanger ending that you just can't miss!! These Chronicles are probably the best fantasy books I have ever read!

Daystar is given a sword by his mother but doesn't even now what it is about and is sent on a mission that he doesn't even have a clue about either. The only thing bothering him is the twingling he feels from the sword and a firewitch named Shiara who can't do any of her magic. Along the way the two meet up with all of the old characters such as Kazul and all the dragons, Morwen, Telemain, and a bunch of wizards who have been causing all the trouble in book two and three. They also meet new characters such as Suz the lizard and a young dragon. However can all of them stop the wizards and rescue Mendanbar from being trapped in the enchanted castle forever?

Searching for Dragons was written from Mendanbar the King of the Enchanted Forests point of view. After he finds parts of the Enchanted Forest have been destroyed he sets out on a journey to find out who did it. By inlisting in the witch Morwen's help he goes to the Mountain of Morning to find the king of the dragons Kazul. (Notice that these names are very imaginative?) However when he is there he runs in Cimorene the princess of Kazul whom was the main character in the first book of this series. Mendanbar learns from Cimorene that Kazul has disappeared. Most likely captured by the evil wizards society. As they set out to find Kazul they have many exciting adventures with giants, a magic carpet that needs fixing, a dwarf who use to be like Rumplestilskin, some more lemon juice, and a magician who is too smart for his own good. This was another great fantasy book by Patricia C. Wrede and I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read the 3rd book in this series. Just to let you know there are 4 books in this series. The names in this book are very imaginative and I always look forward to see what the people are called. This is a great series for kids I think ages 8-15.	2001-08-07

Also it gave me a much different perspective because the movies always talk about Anastasia's life after the tradegy. <br />Anastasia lives a very carefree life when the book begins. She is protected from the bads in the world and is unaware of what is threatning her and her family. She writes vivid accounts about her mothers meetings with Rasputin. When World War I starts Anastasia's life is turned upside down. She and her family are now no longer the royal family and her family has to move to cold Siberia. This book was really written very accurately about a young duchess who didn't really know anything about what was going on in the world. This was probably what led her family the Romannovs to be the last royal family in Russia. This was truly a great book about a young girl who didn't understand pain very well. I highly recommend people to read this book because it gives you a much better insight on Anastasia's life than any movie will ever do.	2001-07-31

Plus you will learn about all the types of dragons, faires, merpeople, centuers, and other interesting magical animals and the category they fall under. <br />Both of these books were fun and charming. After reading these books I got a lot more info. on the wizard world and a better understanding of the first four Harry Potters. What wonderful books and they are for a great cause! Thanks J.K.!	2001-07-31

I felt like I was in the army camp with Abigail and Mrs. Washington when I was reading this book. It had very vivid details on how bad the army camp's condition was. The soliders lacked clothing, food, clean living conditions, etc. The camps smelled horrible. Abigail is touched by all this but she doesn't like how the army treats soliders who run away because they just wanted a better living. However she is greatful to the army for protecting her family from the British and she looks up tho Mrs. Washington very much. This is a great book that was written with great detail! All Dear America fans will enjoy this book.	2001-07-31

However at times the book was a little bit boring because I think the author went in too vivid of detail on things many kids can't understand like me. However I think the adventures they had on the trip was very real like the encounter with the grizzly be Augustus. I recommend this book because it will teach you a lot about the Lewis and Clark Expedition but there will be places that will be hard to understand.	2001-07-31

It was nice to see that book four was 734 pages long, knowing it was the last book before the 'dry spell' while waiting for Hogwarts year 5 to be released in 2002. This book is very juicy in storylines. The book starts out with some very strange happenings at the Qudditch World cup when the Dark Mark is seen.( I won't tell you what the dark mark is or I ruin the suspense!) As most people know there will be no Quidditch this year at Hogworts but to make that up they will have the Triwizard Tournement. They haven't had this event in hundreds of years due to the amount of injuries and deaths to the participants. The suspense continues when Harry somehow gets into the tournament even though he is underage.<br />In this book J.K. also introduced a new character know as Mad-Eye Moody who is the new defense against dark arts teacher who seems to have quite a liking and interest in Harry. As the Triwizard Tournament progress the storylines definelty get much more juicier. As the final event approaches it looks like all the contestants from the three schools are in contention. However the best part of this book isn't until the very very end as there will be a big surprise!!! I don't want to spoil anymore of the book so you will have to read the book! All I can say is after reading the ending of book 4 I can't wait for the return of the Harry Potter books in 2002!!!!	2001-07-31

She could have written a lot more! I will really miss reading about Zoey, Lucas, Nina, Benjamin, Claire, Paolo, Christopher, Aisha and all the others. Now back to this book. For starters I think this book was a great book. However this book wasn't a very good book for ending a series. It left so many things unanswered that it drives me crazy! Here are some:<br />1.Will Nina and Benjamin ever get back together? KA shouldn't have left us wondering! 2.What happend to Jake in the last book? He wasn't even mentioned! 3.What happened to Kate and Aaron? 4.Did Lucas finally go to college? There are many questions that are left answered that I am just so disappointed! I give this book four stars because it was really a very good book to read, but it was written like just another book in the series and not an ending book where we get all our questions answered! There could easily have been another book written after this one!	2001-07-27

The civil war tears her family apart as it also tears apart her beloved country. Day by day life becomes more dreary as the deaths in her family pile up. When her brother's body shows up at the doorstop she learns of his tragic death and can't shut out the inevitable feel and sight of death that has taken over her town since the war began. The only thing she can hope for is that the Lord would not take anymore of her family members away. However things don't go her way. Her mother is sick as well, and her only friend is slowing going mad with all the casulaties and deaths caused by the war. I find that the title When Will This Cruel War Be Over is the best way to describe Emma's feeling as the days drag with the stench of death in her town. The book in many ways was very depressing but the hope in Emma is one of the very lone bight stars in the book. This first book in the Dear America series starts a very promising series.
