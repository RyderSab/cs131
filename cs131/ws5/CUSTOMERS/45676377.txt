It reads very smoothly, a very nicely articulated tale of the 17th century.  It is an excellent historical fiction choice.  I love the way it led to plot twists that I did not expect.  The tale of Juliette tells of a lifestyle full of excitement, love, betrayal and beliefs that one can never be too sure of.  Highly recommended.	2005-07-11

Rabbit Howls takes the reader through the time during therapy to uncover the horrors the troops of Truddi Chase live with.  It is a gripping story, at times difficult to follow so reading the Introduction, Authors' Note and Epilogue is very enlightening.  It is amazing the author was able to create the story from the journal kept, recounting the flashes of memory that gradually lead to the discovery of the 92 different personalities within Truddi Chase.  The accounts of traumatic events are shocking.  One can understand how healing this effort must be.  I can see why this was a NY Times #1 bestseller.  A good read to expand your range of books.  This book presents some nice thought challenges as you try to figure out what the author is referring to in the writing.  Certainly a nice change of pace if you're in a boring reading rut.	2005-07-06

I can't wait to read more from her.<br /><br />Crow Lake tells the story of four family members who lose their parents and struggle to remain an intact family.  The story is told through the eyes of the third child and the perspective she develops of life and her family as she grows into adulthood.  The characters develop wonderfully and encounter situations which make them and their situation quite believable.  In my opinion the only flaw of the book is that it didn't conclude with some event that would have built anticipation for a sequel.  The ending was a little flat for my liking, but this should not deter you from enjoying this peaceful and enjoyable book.  I read this on vacation in three days and love it.	2005-07-06

Shem Creek delivers a delightful reading experience about Linda, a divorcee living in NJ, and her two daughters Lindsay and Gracie as the relocate to Linda's childhood town.  Humor abounds throughout the story as the family encounters the good times and difficulties in their new community.  The characters are lovable, even the ones you love to hate.  The good and bad of the book is it's an extremely enjoyable story and moves quickly (the good), and (the bad) sometimes characters or actions occur too quickly (we never really learn much about Alex, when Brad truly falls in love it's rather sudden in the text).  These are minor flaws compared to the wonderful experience reading another great Frank book.  I will admit Isle of Palms still remains my favorite and the appearance of some of those characters in Shem Creek was fun.  I look forward to reading Pawley's Island.  Highly recommended, and would be especially enjoyable as a summer vacation read.	2005-06-28

Each character is very different and superbly developed.  The rotating style of the book gives each character a short chapter which continues throughout.  This adds greatly to keeping order of the characters and those around them and  avoids leaving the reader confused with all the various people.  Having knowledge of knitting causes one to smile every so often but is certainly not requisite to read this book.  This is an excellent vacation book and very relaxing to read.	2005-06-23

I will say the story is one that creeps back into my mind because I really liked the way it all came together.

So often we blindly accept without doing the mental gymnastics and here are some great examples of the obvious not being quite so (swimming pools vs guns).  This book includes important issues as well as frivilous ones and is definitely not for the politically correct at heart.  If after reading this you can remember to stop and think in a different way your life will be improved because feeling smarter gives everyone a lift.  I can only wish that more of this type of analysis could be done for so many important issues in our society.  In the (hopefully) next book, I have no doubt the authors could unlock autism, reform welfare, fix social security, and perhaps turn a few more beliefs upside down.  Properly examined and compiled figures, unmanipulated by outside influences (politics, society, etc) don't lie.  Here it is to read and believe one can truly think outside the box.	2005-06-16

Journalism is heavily influenced by many factors.  LAKE NEWS brilliantly presents a story of the misuse and positive influence of journalism.  The believability of the story, the characters, and the setting all add to how enjoyable this book is.  Being a NH native I can attest to the truth of attitudes and language presented in the story.  I love Ms. Delinsky's smooth writing style; it's effortless to read.  A super summer reading choice.	2005-06-16

This story is well written making its reading very enjoyable.  Perhaps at some points it seems somewhat unrealistic that the behavoir and/or attitude would exist in the time period.  Overall, however, these flaws are tiny and the stronger points of the book's themes carry it admirably.  I loved the interweaving of art, religion, history, and mystery (the painter's identity.)  I wish some of the sexual episodes would have been written less explicit and more suggestive to generate excitement in our imagination.  They seems almost crude compared to the beautiful way the story is put together.  Fans of \\"Girl With A Pearl Earring\\" will undoubtedly enjoy this novel; well worth the read.	2005-06-07

That, however, does not diminish a great work here.  The lead character, Nicholas, was a little harder to like so it didn't catch me as quickly as I'd like.  The generous assortment of other characters certainly added to a complex cadre that developed beautifully.  The second half of the book was compelling not to put down.  The subject matter was fascinating.  Well worth your time to read this gem.	2005-04-01

Spencerville does indeed do that nicely.  You've got to love these quirky characters with all their endearing flaws.  While this all may sound funny, it's the place you only want to visit in a book.  The cat and mouse game played throughout the book works well and keeps your attention.  The sadistic side of things is edgy enough to give you a shiver, as does the invisible underworld Government angle.  A darn good entertaining book.	2005-01-21

In three days, every page has been read and thoroughly enjoyed.  This is a truly wonderful story and well-deserving of all laudatory words written about it.  This well-rounded story introduces us to several major characters surrounding this amazing animal.  Each story is told magnificently from start to finish.  Along the way, about the ninth chapter, I started to compile a list of words not commonly used and am delighted in learning them (insouciant, obstreperiousness, excoriation, imeriousness, sobriquet, addled, rictus, etc.)  So often what we read today, although entertaining, is created from imaginary circumstances molded and manipulated into sometimes farfetched, but exciting stories.  Here we have real life, packed to the rafters with excitement, a feeling of the undercurrent of a generation ago, skillfully composed into one of the best books I've read.  This is drama set to paper and it's a doozer!	2005-01-21

The plot has been condensed for you in other reviews better than I can repeat.  So, the main character is your narrator and you will understand Rueben well.  Big brother Davy is briefly revealed but never developed that well.  He remains somewhat a mystery but perhaps intentionally so.  The character of younger sister Swede does/says things that create some question as to believability.  Just remember this is fiction and enjoy her for her lovability.  Tormented Dad comes across as a good character and call me a hopeless romatic but I love Roxanne's introduction into the story and what she brings although it happens a bit quickly.  She's a nice strong character as is Jape.  Wow - eerie and good. Very good writing that flows nicely and reads well.<br /><br />Upon starting this book I thought it would be about the tired saga of stupid things teens can do but this story proved to weave itself in other directions and provided multiple aspects of religion, family, justice, prejudice, strength and weakness in human character.	2004-11-02

Her writing ability carries this book and is pleasure to read.  There are no shocking events here, the story simply and beautifully advances the Bonner saga forward.  The climax is nicely constructed as Hannah must make a decision on the direction her future heads.  The love story for this strong and independent character is nicely developed and builds anticipation for the reader.  The author has done a nice job of making us like the next generation that is to follow.  Fans of historical romance like the Outlander series will thoroughly enjoy Donati's writing and her characters.	2004-09-02

Givens does a fine job writing about Scotland and London while moving the story quickly.  The interaction in the society is believable and character development is good.  A character map would help a little along with a sketch of the land for those of us who like to see it laid out.  Where this book falls short is in the exchanges between Alex and Mary.  She comes off as a emotionally immature London society girl after we've seen her embark on a new life in the Scottish highlands that in itself suggest bravery and growth of the character.  Her emotion as the war approaches is understandable but the behavior by the character is the behavior of a child.  Knowing this I think Gabaldon fans can enjoy this story since its sequel does sound worth reading.	2004-08-25

Mr. McCullough indeed paints us a view of Adams that our history books did not, as well as a different perspective on Franklin and Jefferson.  Who's to say one is more correct than the other.

It is absent such things as petty squabling that you might expect between two women competing for the attentions of Guthrie, or irritated ramblings of Ella's sister when the boys visit.  It does contain just a glimpse of insight into the feelings which contributes to the feel of how this story proceeds.  The chapters tell the stories of people in Holt and how some connect in unusual ways.  Each story pulls you into their world through strong character development, and the absence of quotation marks for spoken words by the characters uniquely adds to that overall effect.  This is a very enjoyable read for its peacefulness, a good book for a good feeling of the heart.	2004-06-05

The most interesting and flowing parts of this book surrounded the characters in action.  The development of most the characters is too brief causing acceptance of them versus getting to know them.  The scientific and environmental detail while necessary and compelling at some points unfortunately more often detracts from the storyline.  A little more editing of the story would have helped, and yet at times the text jumps forward causing the reader to fill in the blanks.  These inconsistencies are a bit distracting.  Overall this not a bad read, I just was expecting more due to the hype about best book of the year.  Plot twists are intriguing and creative.  Do enjoy this book.	2004-04-04

It can open your thoughts to another aspect of how to look at the subject matter of the story.  The settings are richly presented, the writing flows, and the story moves at a good pace.  Do not select this book and expect historical facts in every aspect.  It is a work of fiction based on some historical fact.  Dan Brown is an excellent writer and presents his view in a spellbinding story.  This book is thoroughly enjoyable and shouldn't be missed.	2004-03-29

It is an excellent book to spend time reading.  A good story, very likable characters, and an accurate depiction of the political scene (I can personally vouch for it).  It's suspenseful and loaded with superb plot twists.  So what's the big deal that North launched a few well deserved jabs at those in high places.  Not altogether undeserving given what we know.  Christian themes are deeply rooted in many Marines lives (personal knowledge hereagain).  And what are we expecting here, remember it is a work of fiction.  Take it as that and enjoy yourself.  This is a tremendous effort and well worth reading.	2004-03-29

This rich portrait of a young Chinese girl, Pei, takes you on a journey through the silk sisterhood of the 1920's and 1930's.

The idea of time travel and romance was not exactly what I go for, but this one, oh it is incredible.  After several years this still is my No. 1 book of all time.  Don't miss this one and its successors.  The story of Claire and Jamie is captivating.  Diana Gabaldon leads you to unbelievably romantic situations and lets your mind get lost in what she has not written.  It's masterful and provides a key element in leaving you wanting more.  I'll admit that Outlander is the best of the series, but the others will fill the craving Outlander leaves you with.  Don't miss this great read.	2002-08-05

The &quot;sister bond&quot; is beautifully developed as well as the &quot;silence&quot; that quietly exists still today in Irish descendent households (the powerfully unspoken moments).  The story is well crafted througout.  A strong debut novel!	2002-04-01

While the environmental details can bog you down in this text, forge ahead and this recounting of actual events chills your sense of contentment.  Jonathan Harr does an incredible job of weaving this complex story into sensible story-telling.  An award worthy effort.	2002-04-01

The story is well written to demonstrate how one person feels about another does relate to their gender orientation even though words temporarily say otherwise.  Entertaining story which this author weaves so well.  Very much worth reading.	2002-03-15

I can't say I liked or agree with the author's conclusions, but I highly respect her ability to put this together.  I found the story of the past more interesting than the current story of her relationships.  Don't miss her other gem Fortune's Rock!	2001-11-26

Faith is a wonderful thing and it's shown how it's best served.  External pressure for faith is examined with its unexpected results.  The depth of faith is also shown in the main characters.  I loved how each told their story from their perspective.  Don't let your faith, or lack of, prevent learning from the many aspects of this book.  The views and actions of this Country are also brought to light.  While the ending seemed a bit too long, this book comes highly recommended.	2001-11-26
