I was looking forward to reading more of Orwell's essays.  I soon discovered, however, that Orwell's essays not published in book form shared all the faults of those that I had read, but few of the virtues.<br /><br />Many cite Orwell's honesty as his primary virtue, but these essays reveal a man who is, if not dishonest, then at least quite blind to his own experiences.  He states, without any supporting evidence, that \\"only Socialist nations can fight effectively\\" (p. 67, from The Lion and the Unicorn), despite the fact that he served in an army organized along socialist lines (as narrated on p. 255), if not the army of a socialist nation, five years prior to the publication of this statement; the army was defeated decisively by Generalissimo Franco's decidedly non-socialist forces.<br /><br />Orwell also frequently resorts to name-calling.  Those who disagree with him politically are almost invariably \\"reactionaries\\", \\"Fascists\\", or \\"pro-Fascist\\".  Jack London is \\"not . . . a fully civilised man.\\"; rather, he possesses a \\"streak of savagery\\".  Any thought, expression, or even word of which Orwell disapproves is \\"vulgar\\", from the cartoon postcards of Donald McGill to Kipling's statement that \\"He travels the fastest who travels alone\\" to Yeats's use of the word (!) \\"loveliness\\" (Orwell also claims that \\"Yeats's tendency is Fascist.\\" on p. 273).<br /><br />It is clear to me after reading this volume that the editors who selected pieces for the three volumes of essays published during Orwell's lifetime made the right choices; they show him at his best.  The rest of the material here is hardly worth reading except as a window into the soul of a man who was incapable of viewing the world except through the distorting lens of a commitment to socialism.	2005-09-07

He is, in fact, a liar, a chiseler, a boor, and a swindler, as his conduct over the week or so covered in this novel demonstrates. <br /> <br />Skipton is ruined in the end, of course.  I do think that the novel had been better had any of the major characters been at all sympathetic; as it is, only Lotte, Skipton's landlady's daughter, who knits socks for him and brings his meals to his room is at all appealing.	2005-07-17

Pongo Twistleton's Uncle Fred, the Fifth Earl of Ickenham, is dedicated, in his own words, to spreading sweetness and light wherever he goes (others have less complimentary words for what he does).  In aid of this objective, he has previously appeared at Blandings Castle in the guise of the noted nerve specialist Sir Roderick Glossop, and been discovered as an impostor.  While he remains a favorite of Clarence, the Ninth Earl of Emsworth and the proprietor of Blandings Castle, he is extremely unpopular with Clarence's sister Constance, who actually runs the place.<br /><br />No Blandings Castle novel is complete, of course, without at least one impostor, sundered hearts that must be reunited, the threat or actuality of the theft of the Empress of Blandings (the Earl of Emsworth's prize Berkshire sow), and an abundance of farcical monkey business.  Wodehouse supplies all of these, plus the presence of the two Earls, each one of the great characters in literature, and Alaric, the Duke of Dunstable, an impossibly rude man and the perfect foil for Uncle Fred.<br /><br />All in all, a marvelously funny book by the greatest master of farce ever.	2005-06-30

In this, they could hardly be more in error.  The only contender for the title of the greatest novelist of the twentieth or any other century is P.G. Wodehouse, farceur supreme, or, in plain English, an extraordinarily funny writer.<br /><br />Wodehouse wrote novels and stories that can be easily classified into several series:  there are the Bertie and Jeeves novels and stories, the Blandings Castle novels and stories, the Mr. Mulliner stories, the Uncle Fred novels, etc.  The characters from one series rarely appear in another.  This novel is an exception.  Uncle Fred appears at Blandings Castle, where he poses as Sir Roderick Glossop, normally seen in the Bertie and Jeeves novels (and one story); indeed, he encounters Sir Roderick while traveling to Blandings Castle.  Uncle Fred, properly, Frederick Altamont Cornwallis Twistleton, fifth Earl of Ickenham, is a man who \\"together with a juvenile waistline, . . . still retained the bright enthusiasms and the fresh, unspoiled outlook of a slightly inebriated undergraduate\\" at the age of sixty or so.  It is he who sets in motion the events that enable young lovers to marry and his nephew Pongo to settle his gambling debts.  In general, his role is that normally played by Lord Emsworth's younger brother Galahad.<br /><br />Of course, any reader of Wodehouse novels knows at the start that things will turn out all right for any sundered hearts or frustrated lovers, as he knows that, any time the efficient Baxter appears, he will be discredited despite being thoroughly correct.  The fun is in discovering just how it happens.<br /><br />And what fun it is.  Wodehouse's mastery of the English language is unrivaled.  He succeeds in producing prose that not only is enjoyable in its own right but also moves events ahead at a pace that is nigh exhausting.  In the Bertie and Jeeves novels and stories, it is Bertie's narration that does this.  In this novel, it is the dialogue as much as the narration that moves events ahead, establishes the characters, and gives the reader immense pleasure.nd Jeeves novels and stories, it is Bertie's narration that does this.

In addition, there are some special features:  Bertie's Uncle Percival, Lord Worplesdon, the second husband of Bertie's Aunt Agatha (the one who, as I recall, \\"chews ground glass and conducts human sacrifices at the full moon\\") makes his only appearance in the Wodehouse oeuvre, as I believe is also the case for Boko Fittleworth, whose actions go awry just as often as Bertie's. <br /> <br />It's all held together, of course, by Bertie's extraordinary narration. <br /> <br />I have read this book perhaps a dozen times, and I still laugh aloud at least once on nearly every page.	2005-05-12

Reynolds Price, in his introduction, states that Hemingway and Capote are the \\". . . only two writers of distinguished fiction . . . to become American household names.\\"  The comparisons with Hemingway go further, I think, than that.  Both writers produced their best work by age forty or so, and both, at that point, exhibited increasingly bizarre and self-destructive behavior, becoming celebrities more than writers.  Capote was forty when he published In Cold Blood in 1965, and he produced very little work at all after that.  Only three of the stories here were written after 1960.    So we have seventeen stories dated from 1943, when Capote was eighteen or nineteen, to 1960, plus three later stories.  As Price notes, several of the earlier stories betray the influence of his earlier contemporaries and fellow southerners Eudora Welty and Carson McCullers.  Yet even in many of these, Capote's voice is his own.  \\"Children on Their Birthdays\\", for example, is a marvelous story.    Taken as a whole, this collection is a reminder of what a great writer Capote was and what a tragedy it was that his muse abandoned him so early.	2005-04-24
US	52882363	R2PQP96LPUP44F	1585672319	647115723	The Mating Season	Books	5	22	22	N	N	One of the Best and Funniest Books Ever Written	Evelyn Waugh, a tight man with a compliment for his fellow authors, referred to P.G. Wodehouse as the Master, and nowhere are the reasons more apparent than in The Mating Season.    There is never a dull moment as Bertie Wooster impersonates Gussie Fink-Nottle, Claude Cattermole (\\"Catsmeat\\") Pirbright impersonates the non-existent Meadowes, to appear at Deverill Hall as Gussie's personal gentleman (Bertie is impersonating Gussie at the time), Gussie impersonates Bertie, with Jeeves in tow, no fewer than four pairs of sundered hearts are re-united, as Bertie once again escapes the matrimonial trap, and Esmond Haddock, the landed proprietor of Deverill Hall, defies his five aunts to marry Claude's sister, the celebrated Hollywood actress Corky.  With all this action and imposture, however, Wodehouse's writing is so skillful that the reader, with no effort, keeps the characters and action straight.  There is, of course, time for Wodehouse's unexcelled magic with the English language.  To put it more briefly, this novel provides one whale of a good time.    Wodehouse wrote dozens of hilarious, wonderfully-written, and intricately-plotted novels.  It is high praise indeed to note that The Mating Season would almost certainly rank in the top five in any poll of Wodehouse fans.	2005-03-28

From the tenderness of the stories about Wheeler Catlett and his law practice first collected in The Wild Birds to the boisterous, almost slapstick humor of the Ptolemy Proudfoot stories first collected in Watch With Me, Berry covers an impressive range of material. <br /> <br />He also confronts the reader with some difficult questions regarding the value of a way of life that had already, for the most part, vanished when he published the first of these stories.

This is a terrible book; if it were possible for a book literally to stink, this one would. <br /> <br />Since 1970, I have been an admirer of Anthony Burgess, but only a qualifed admirer.  I think that his work is uneven, and that he's frequently more interested in showing off his own erudition than crafting a good book.  In my opinion, Tremor of Intent and A Vision of Battlements, for example, are quite successful novels, while MF and A Dead Man in Deptford are not; others may differ, but that's not really the point here.  The point is that I have no axe to grind on Burgess's behalf. <br /> <br />I am willing, if supplied with evidence, to believe that Burgess was a monster as a person; he would be in the company of such major literary figures as Hemingway and Fitzgerald as such. <br /> <br />Roger Lewis, however, seems to be so obsessed by his hatred of Burgess that, rather than telling us the story of his life and showing how it fits with his work, he finds it necessary to condemn virtually everything about Burgess, going on for an entire page (pp. 10-11) about Burgess's comb-over hairstyle and general appearance, comparing it to that of a \\"snapper turtle . . . tapir . . . . baboon.\\"  He wastes the reader's time with completely irrelevant observations, using a footnote (p. 255) to express his opinion that the cavemen in Quest for Fire, for which Burgess wrote the screenplay, look like the bearded male model in The Joy of Sex's illustrations; exactly what this has to do with a biography of Anthony Burgess is far from clear to me.  Another example is a rant of approximately half a page (pp. 110-111) on the inferiority of Welsh culture.  Does it actually add anything to a biography to include eight lines giving details of the 1960s television series Ben Casey, based solely on an off-the-cuff reference to it by Burgess?  Or to spend half a page on a footnote poking fun at a British television personality named Clive James? <br /> <br />Ultimately, Lewis is guilty of the major sin of which he accuses Burgess:  it's all about him.  In the guise of a biography, he has given us a parade of his own prejudices. <br /> <br />In my opinion, Burgess's work falls far short of his reputation as a prodigiously talented writer.  He produced no book to which I can point and say unambiguously that it is a great book.  He did, however, produce a body of thoughtful, well-written work, and he deserves far better than this.	2005-03-08

It covers nearly every aspect of them - their behavior, how to recognize one (although Dr. Hare quite properly cautions against making a diagnosis), how to protect yourself against one.  It does not cover the psychodynamic issues involve, e.g., conflicts and unconscious processes; Dr. Hare explicitly avoids those issues as not properly the subject matter of his book (p. xii), and I feel that the book is complete without any discussion of them. <br /> <br />It does not offer a solution in the form of treatment for psychopaths individually or in the form of recommendations for families or any larger group to prevent the production of more psychopaths.  Dr. Hare is commendably honest in saying that psychopaths are poor candidates for psychotherapy, which may actually make them worse (pp. 195-196). <br /> <br />The copyright on the book is 1993.  Dr. Hare notes toward the end of the book (p. 203) that \\"the Canadian government recently challenged me to design an experimental treatment/management program for [criminal psychopaths].\\"  I truly hope that Dr. Hare updates this book to include the results of that program and of other research done since 1993.	2005-02-08

He does a fine job here.  While the earlier book is simply a narration of incidents whose narration is inevitably distorted in Cobb's favor, this book is an earnest attempt to present a fair picture of its subject. <br /> <br />Stump bends over backwards to be fair to the eminently dislikeable Cobb; indeed, that is the book's primary fault.  For example, on several occasions, the book mentions Cobb's excellence as a defensive center fielder, yet statistics posted early in the book give his lifetime fielding percentage as .961, with 274 errors in 3,033 games.  Cobb clearly won games with his bat and legs, but he lost them with his glove and arm.  Stump also mentions the oft-narrated incident in 1925 in which the thirty-eight-year old Cobb allegedly told two sportswriters before a game that he would abandon his hands-apart hitting style and attempt to hit home runs.  He went six-for-six in the game, with three home runs and a double.  The next day he hit two home runs and a single.  The natural question to ask is why, if Cobb could get nine hits, including five home runs, in nine at-bats while trying to hit home runs, he didn't stick with it, since his career average was approximately three hits in eight at bats, none of them home runs.  Is the story apocryphal?  Did Cobb simply know that the starting pitchers for the next two games were pitchers against which he had had unusual success in the past?  Stump never even asks the question. <br /> <br />There are other flaws.  Stump spends the first 400 pages of the book on the first forty-two years of Cobb's life, covering the period from his birth to the end of his major league career, but only twenty on the remaining thirty-three.  Of course, Cobb would be of little interest had he not been a great baseball player, but, given that Cobb was clearlyseriously mentally ill, it would have been a good idea, I think, to spend more time on, for example, the causes of the break-ups of his two marriages.  Stump, moreover, calls Cobb psychotic in several places in the book.  It would also, I think, have been a good idea for him to consult with one or more mental health professionals for a more precise diagnosis. <br /> <br />These, though, are minor reservations about a book that held my interest from the first page to the last.  All serious baseball fans will want to read this book, and even many of those who are not very interested in baseball will find it interesting.	2004-12-23

Wodehouse wrote this book in his very late seventies (he was seventy-nine by the time it was published), and he had already written ten Bertie and Jeeves novels.  Yet there is new material here:  Sir Roderick Glossop reveals hitherto-hidden aspects of his character and Bertie's former schoolmaster Aubrey Upjohn appears in person for the first time. <br /> <br />Wodehouse's books, however, are not appropriate subjects for this sort of detailed criticism.  Suffice it to say that I roar with laughter every time I re-read How Right You Are, Jeeves.  It would be impossible to improve on the plot, the characters or the language.  Read and enjoy.	2004-12-20

This book enables a layman like me to make sense of them, and of many other words in more common usage.  Michael Quinion's explanations of the word parts (usually prefixes and suffixes, but frequently syllables found in the middle of words) are clearly written, and he provides examples of the most common words using each stem. <br /> <br />I would estimate that perhaps 80% of the word stems contained in this book are of Greek origin, either directly or as modified by Latin usage.  Since the list of stems is 269 pages long, however, that means that there are plenty of word stems of different origin. <br /> <br />This is also one of those rare reference books that are a joy just to dip into and read an entry or two.	2004-07-20

The authors, while clearly Serkin fans, give a balanced look at his life and his music.<br />I would prefer that the book had been considerably longer, and that the additional length had been used to discuss things like his choice of repertoire.  For example, the authors, in refuting the claim that Serkin didn't play much besides Beethoven and Brahms, note that he played a good deal of Chopin's music in recital.  The list of Carnegie Hall performances in the book bears them out.  The list of Serkin's recordings, however, shows very little Chopin, and it would have been interesting to find out why the disparity existed.<br />The fact that I wish that the book had been longer is also, though, testament to how well-written it is.  The short pieces in the second half of the book by his colleagues and students add interest, as well.	2004-07-12

They aren't bad; I don't think Fraser is capable of producing a bad story or novel.  They just don't merit the praise that The General Danced at Dawn and McAuslan In the Rough do.<br />There are a few excellent stories here:  The Gordon Women is plotted with a skill worthy of Wodehouse, The Constipation of O'Brien shows McAuslan at his comic best, and Extraduction (not really a story, but one of the offerings here) is a touching remembrance of the battalion's colonel.  On the other hand, Captain Errol relies in large part on a &quot;surprise&quot; ending which I was anticipating an entire page (in a thirty-one-page story) earlier than it was revealed.  Ye Mind Jie Dee, Fletcher? is not about Fraser's outfit in northern Africa circa 1945, but, rather, Scotland's 1978 national soccer team.  McAuslan narrates it in his usual dialect - for eight unbroken pages, and McAuslan isn't nearly as funny out of uniform.<br />Those who have enjoyed The General Danced at Dawn and McAuslan In the Rough (two of my very favorite collections of stories) will most probably find this worth the read, as I did.  They may also find, as I did, that it suffers by comparison with the two earlier collections.	2004-06-02

Wodehouse hit his stride in the 1920s (at approximately the age of forty!), and Right Ho, Jeeves, the latest work published here, dates from 1934, so these are works from the beginning of his greatest period, which, for my money, runs to the mid-1950s (Wodehouse lived until Valentine's Day 1975).<br />Wodehouse was that rare author who was a master of both the novel and the short story.  These stories are wonderful.  I'm particularly fond of Jeeves and the Old School Chum and Sir Roderick Comes to Lunch; others may well have different favorites, and who am I to differ?  Every story is a jewel in its own way.<br />Right Ho, Jeeves isn't, in my opinion, in a class with The Mating Season, Summer Lightning, or Heavy Weather as one of the greatest of Wodehouse's novels, but that's a bit like saying that Symphony No. 25 in Gm isn't Mozart's greatest symphony.  Symphony No. 25 is still a wonderful symphony, and Right Ho, Jeeves, is a great, funny novel.<br />Wodehouse has brought me more happiness than any other author; there are, I'm sure, thousands more who would join me in that opinion.  If you've never read any Wodehouse, you could do far worse than to start with this book, and you're in for a rare treat.	2004-03-09

Professor Bradford's biography is both complete and well-written.<br />It is marred, however, by Professor Bradford's insistence that \\"Amis's fiction (is) one of the most entertaining and thought-provoking autobiographies ever produced.\\"  His point is not simply that Amis has modeled some characters on people he has known, nor that some events are paralleled in Amis's life.  Virtually every writer of fiction draws from his life.  He goes much further than that, claiming that nearly every character in Amis's novels and stories is intended to be Amis himself or somebody that Amis knew.<br />He starts with the contention that Jim Dixon, the protagonist of Lucky Jim, Amis's first and perhaps best-known novel, is Amis himself.  Dixon, fresh out of college, is teaching in an obscure English college.  Amis began teaching at University College of Swansea in Wales while completing his graduate thesis at Oxford.  The parallels break down there, however.  The plot of Lucky Jim involves Dixon's jettisoning his unattractive, somewhat mentally ill girlfriend and acquiring an attractive, nice blonde one.  Amis married an attractive blonde woman while still at Oxford, more than a year before he began teaching at Swansea.  Central to the plot of Lucky Jim is Dixon's status as an outsider, never explicitly stated but implied by many things, including the fact that he is from the north of England with an accent that immediately identifies him as such and the fact that he attended a university of no particular prestige (a passage in the third chapter hints that it may be the University of Leicester).  Amis, by contrast, was born and raised in London, and, by Bradford's own account had a BBC accent.  As already noted, he was an Oxford graduate.  Whatever else Amis was, he was not an outsider, at least not by virtue of his birthplace, accent, or university education.<br />On andon it goes, with Bradford claiming that Simona Quick, the waif-like nineteen-year-old in I Want It Now, is really Jane Howard, Amis's second wife, who was in her mid-forties at the period in which the book was written and takes place, that Amis has split himself between two characters in Girl, 20, that the ten-year-old boy who is to be castrated to preserve his pure, youthful voice in The Alteration is in fact Amis in his mid-fifties, worried about declining .... prowess, and that Amis has split himself into four different characters in The Old Devils, attributing to them such unusual characteristics as the fact that they all drink too much.<br />Bradford and his editor also get some facts wrong, either by design or by laziness.  On page 206, he claims that, in One Fat Englishman, \\"Micheldene is obliged to take part in a game of charades and is asked to become the embodiment of 'Englishness'\\".  In fact, the other characters try to act \\"Britishly\\", and it is Micheldene who is to guess what the word is.  This is not a very important point, but consulting the novel itself is all that is necessary to get it right.<br />Similarly, Bradford, in claiming that Jake Richardson, the title character of Jake's Thing, is actually an older Jim Dixon (who, by Bradford's thesis, is Amis under a different name), asserts on page 305 that \\"Jake's given name is James\\", while, in the novel itself, Jake's given name is, in fact, Jaques, pronounced \\"Jakes\\".  One might argue that the French \\"Jacques\\" (Richardson's ancestors came from France) is the equivalent of the English \\"James\\", but the chain of reasoning is now one link longer, and, once again, consulting the novel would have been sufficient to provide correct information.	2003-11-08

He had more than his share of problems with alcohol, jealousy, and anger.  He bore grudges, physically bullied others, and frequently lied.  Those who knew O'Hara or have studied his life seem to agree on all these points.<br />Geoffrey Wolff, however, seems to think that these characteristics justify him in contradicting himself, failing to verity facts, devoting only one paragraph to the last three and a half years of O'Hara's life, and generally using a biography of John O'Hara as a platform from which to pronounce his opinions on subjects ranging from Norman Podhoretz's Making It (page 315) to the likelihood that James Thurber threw a second glass of whisky at Dashiell Hammett after throwing one at Lilian Hellman - during an incident at which O'Hara seems not to have been present (page 131).<br />The laziness and poor quality of the research and editing are evident throughout the book.  Let these stand as examples:<br />On page 52, Wolff writes \\"According to at least two biographers, O'Hara's grade of 97 was the highest ever recorded at Niagara (an absolute that this biographer, who confesses to a lazy failure to chase down and pin facts of this nature, absolutely disbelieves).\\"  I would have thought that, if the grade was worth reporting, it would be worth researching.  As it is, Wolff turns his own, self-described laziness into an excuse to call into question the accuracy of two other biographers.<br />On page 42, Wolff describes O'Hara at age fifteen as \\"taller than six feet\\".  On page 179, he states that O'Hara \\"caused to be reported that 'he was married once, is six feet one inch tall and weighs 184 pounds.' (So he added an inch; doesn't everyone?)\\"  Well, was O'Hara \\"taller than six feet\\", or was he exactly six feet tall?  I don't really care, but since Wolff is accusing O'Hara of dishonesty, shouldn't the facts on which his claim of O'Hara's dishonesty rests not contradict each other?<br />O'Hara was a greatauthor, even though he was far less than a great person - a statement that can accurately be made of his earlier contemporaries Hemingway and Fitzgerald.  He deserves better than this.	2003-10-12

Although they are all set in the Europe (in general, England) that existed prior to the First World War (in which the author was killed), they remain fresh today; the period and location can usually be identified, but the point of the humor is timeless.  The overall high quality is illustrated by the fact that, if you ask two dozen Saki aficionados to name their one favorite story, you'll probably get a dozen different answers.<br />Saki is one of those authors who was a master of the short story, but not of longer genres.  The novels and plays lack the tight construction of his stories.  The collection still gets five stars, however, because the stories alone would be a bargain at twice the price of this volume.	2003-05-20

If you just want to lie back in your recliner for a few hours and have a few laughs, though, this is your book.  There's next to no plot, and there are more than a few New York in-jokes and Yiddish phrases to get in the way, but Trillin's writing is, as nearly always, delightful.  There's even a little twist to what passes for a plot at the end of the book.	2003-05-13

Chappell's narration veers from straightforward fiction to fantasy, telling of the gusto and humor with which Joe Robert meets life.  I found myself laughing out loud and slapping my knee at some of the passages, while being touched deeply by the novel's underlying theme of belonging to a family, a place, and a tradition.	2003-05-08

His explanations are complete, and, as far as this amateur can tell, accurate.  They are also fun to read.<br />He also includes quite a few recipes, which are simple and easy to prepare.

I thought it was a great book then, and my appreciation for it has deepened over the many years since then.<br />This is a truly great novel.  As a high school freshman, I liked it because it told a good, traditional story of the American West.  As I've grown older, I have also discovered its themes of fidelity, the struggle between the frontiersman and the farmer, and the question of whether violence can be a solution.<br />Shane is not just one of the greatest novels about the American West.  It is one of the greatest novels ever written.	2003-04-29

The studies are arranged in a progressively more difficult order, and Noad includes his comments on each as to what skills it seeks to develop, etc.<br />While I feel that the book deserves five stars, it is not without problems, specifically:<br />     1.  It is extraordinarily difficult to keep the book<BR>         open to the desired pages when it is on a music<BR>         stand; spiral-binding would have solved this.  This<BR>         may seem like nit-picking, but it's an important<BR>         shortcoming given the purpose of the book.<br />     2.  Right-hand fingerings are given for only a few of<BR>         the pieces; in many cases, choice of the proper<BR>         right-hand pattern can make a huge difference in<BR>         the ease of performing a piece.<br />     3.  While Noad gives full left-hand fingerings, he<BR>         does not give diagrams of hand-positions to adopt<BR>         for a passage, with fingers in place for the next<BR>         few notes.<br />Even taking these into account, however, it remains, in my opinion, the best book of exercises available to any but the most advanced classical guitarist.	2003-01-08

Parkening doesn't spend much space on choosing a guitar, but, then, I'd imagine that anybody who buys the book already has a guitar.  He does spend lots of space on holding the guitar properly, sitting properly, and positioning both hands properly (I benefited from this last, even though I've been a guitarist for thirty-five years).  He goes on to cover tuning and the two basic right-hand strokes.<br /><br />The music is arranged in a logical order, getting progressively more difficult through the book, including several duets for student and teacher.  Every piece is appropriate for a beginner, and no piece involves anything that has not been taught.<br /><br />The book ends with Mr Parkening's own views on what a musician should try to achieve.  Although I do not share his Christian faith, I found his views stimulating and inspiring.<br /><br />This book is so good that the only negative comment that I have is that it would be even better if spiral bound to lie open on a music stand.<br /><br />UPDATE:  The book is now issued with a spiral binding.  Thank you to Henry for pointing this out, and to Hal Leonard for making the change.	2001-07-16

I picked this book up a couple of weeks ago and have been learning the pieces in it, and I'm satisfied.<br />The fifty pieces in the book are arranged in more or less increasing order of difficulty. There is a nice variety of different tempos, time signatures, keys, etc., and the pieces are about as good as they can be at this level of difficulty.<br />I'm torn between four stars and five stars for this book. The reasons that I've decided on four stars are:<br />The pages in the beginning devoted to brief biographies of the composers would have been more useful had they been devoted to things like explaining that p means the thumb, a means the ring finger, and general advice on right-hand patterns where the notation does not explicitly give right-hand fingerings.<br />The notation should give right-hand fingerings more frequently. Very often, I can get the notes in several different ways. My guess is that some of them will build up bad habits when I move to more demanding pieces; it would be helpful to be practicing patterns that will prove helpful in the future.<br />These are, however, minor criticisms. This is a very nice collection of pieces, and I can recommend it whole-heartedly.	2000-12-07

Calvin is both lovable and exasperating.  The cartoons capture the boredom of school, the fun of making believe you're a pirate or a spaceman or an adventurer, the frustration that the most loving of parents experience.  Mostly, though, the cartoons are some of the funniest that you'll ever read or see; both the drawing and the dialogue are great.	2000-10-06

Something Fresh isn't quite as good as Summer Lightning and Heavy  Weather, because that memorable pig, the Empress of Blandings, has not yet  appeared at the Castle.  Heavy Weather takes place immediately after Summer  Lightning, and the two are, in my opinion, two of Wodehouse's very best.   Some of the great Wodehouse characters are here - the woolly-headed Ninth  Earl of Emsworth, his sister, Lady Constance, and brother, The Honorable  Galahad Threepwood, not to mention, among others, The Efficient Baxter.   Not to be missed by anybody with a sense of humor.	1998-10-02
