US	52207482	RUNVABT6LGRLR	014038572X	249148416	The Outsiders	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A new mythology	The late mythologist Joseph Campbell was once asked what happens when parents fail to pas on their mythology to their children...where do children today get their myth?  <br />Campbell's response:  &quot;They make it  up themselves.  This is why we have graffiti all over the city.  These kids  have their own gangs and their own initiations and their own morality, and  they are doing the best they can.  But they are dangerous because their own  laws are not those of the city.&quot;<br />In The Outsiders, S.E. Hinton  explores this theme of adolescents left alone without the guidance of adult  role models and the tragic results that can ensue.  The adolescents in this  novel have fashioned a mythology of their own and modeled it after the gang  leaders, who get druck, lift hubcaps and blow off steam in gang fights.  As  one might expect, when conflict arises the characters resolve thier  conflicts, as some adolescents do, with violence; with little or no thought  for the consequences of their actions.<br />Through Ponyboy's eyes we see the  growing resentment between Greasers and Socs that escalates into two  conflicts between the gangs...both with tragic results. Ponyboy learns that  Socs are no different than the Greasers, they are equally ignored by their  parents.<br />An excellent companion to Romeo &amp; Juliet and even West Side  Story...all three are compelling works that can and should be used as  springboards for teens to discuss their emerging independence, their  beliefs and behavior.	2000-07-12

Lewis.  If you believe that, then you just may be  the king or queen from Narnia; you certainly don't live in, or have much  knowledge of today's literature for children and teens.<br />The diary of a  young girl who unsuspectingly is introducted to LSD says &quot;It was  glorious&quot;, but we later hear her say, &quot;the garbage that goes with  drugs makes the price too god-dammed high for anyone to pay.&quot;  Those  two quotations helps us understand and reveal an adolescent's struggle  toward maturity.<br />The content of the book is unpleasant, the language can  be crude and the experiences horrifying, yet because of that this is a must  read for teenagers and their parents.  The book offers no solutions.<br />When  this book was published in 1971 (according to the Statistical Abstract of  the US) there were 38000 rapes, 16000 murders, 2505 deaths from drug  overdoses.  In 1997 rapes more than doubled to 97500, murders increased to  21600 and accidential deaths from overdosage skyrocketed to 13923.<br />These  aspects are around our homes and children.  J.R.R. Tolkien once stated,  &quot;It does not pay to leave a dragon out of your claculations if you  live near him.&quot;  Our lives are filled with dragons, so we better be  prepared.  Some say this book is an extreme case, bit it's impact cannot be  denied!	2000-07-12

Jeffrey Lionel Magee wanders into Two Mills, PA and  instantly creates a larger than life character who can out run a dog, hit a  homerun off the best pitcher in town, and win a race by running backwards.   Aside from the unbvelievable physical feats Maniac Magee also helps erase  the invisible line drawn between the east and west sides of town. <br />Why is  Jeffrey a maniac?  Because he can do Houdini-like feats, or because he is  willing to confront, albeit unknowingly the status quo of Two Mills?<br />The  slight exaggerations of nearly impossible situations are really brought to  life as Spinneli examines real issues such as illiteracy, homelessness and  racial prejudice...the story is &quot;real&quot;, but it may have been  embellished, and I dare say that has made it a great book!	2000-07-12

Eventually it is safe to return to London, but is it safe for Willie to  return to his mother?

Cormier's books are representations of realism; and that usually makes him a target of                               censors, and or controversy. Once again, he weaves a story of struggle, and it ends up an                                unsuccessful struggle. I enjoy Cormier's books because they have  twists and don't have                               happy endings...the  world is filled with dragons, and we better be prepared for them.                                Some of these dragons give us undesirable endings.<br />                               The quotation in the summary is from Mary  Shelley, and the ending reads...he only                                mistakes it for happiness...&quot; Keep that in mind as you read or think  about the book. <br />                              You will either hate or  find you self feeling sorry for Eric, and that is what Cormier                                wants, he wants you to identify with the character and  have strong feelings...if not the                               book fails.  It is ironic that we find sympathy for a serial killer, but that is not the  only irony                               in the novel. <br />                               Keep in mind that &quot;Lori&quot; is short for  &quot;Lorelei&quot;, a German maiden who lured sailors to                                shipwreck on the rocks of the Rhine River.

Tish is trying desperately to do  the child-rearing that                                                 her  mother should be doing. When her English teacher assigns a journal, Tish                                                  is sure she won't write at  all, but once she starts, she finds writing cathartic,                                                  especially since Mrs. Dunphrey keeps her word  and doesn't actually read                                                  anything that the girl tells her not to read. A totally happy ending would  be                                                 unrealistic, but there  is hope that Tish and Matt will have a better life. <br />                                                 A great read that will open your eyes to the  hardships of a not so ordinary                                                  teenager.	2000-06-29

Once again, he weaves a story of struggle, and it ends up an unsuccessful struggle. I enjoy Cormier's books  because they have twists and don't have happy endings...the world is filled  with dragons, and we better be prepared for them. Some of these dragons  give us undesirable endings.<br />     The quotation in the summary is from  Mary Shelley, and the ending reads...he only mistakes it for  happiness...&quot; Keep that in mind as you read or think about the book.  <br />     You will either hate or find you self feeling sorry for Eric, and  that is what Cormier wants, he wants you to identify with the character and  have strong feelings...if not the book fails. It is ironic that we find  sympathy for a serial killer, but that is not the only irony in the novel.  <br />     Keep in mind that &quot;Lori&quot; is short for  &quot;Lorelei&quot;, a German maiden who lured sailors to shipwreck on the  rocks of the Rhine River. How fitting!<br />     Enjoy this book, and read  Cormier's The Chocolate War...the novel that is a study in conformity and  cruelty.	2000-06-26

A totally happy ending would be unrealistic, but there is hope  that Tish and Matt will have a better life. <br />A great read that will open  your eyes to the hardships of a not so ordinary teenager.	2000-05-19

I was waiting for an explosive confrontation between the characters that never came.<br />I adore Lnych's novels, especially Slot  Machine and Extreme Elvin, and this one just didn't live up to my  expectations.  I hope you will try it yourself, perhaps you'll have a  better time than I did...certainly don't pass up _Slot Machine_ or _Extreme  Elvin_.	2000-05-17

Scott Fitzgerald once wrote, &quot;show me a hero and I'llwrite you a tragedy&quot;.<br />Josh is certainly a local hero, as heleads his high school to great things on the athletic fields, but his personality and character are on the edge, and sometimes over the edge.<br />I grew up with the idea that leaders, whether they be in the classroom or on the ballfield had to have a clean slate when it comes to your character, perhaps this book is making a societal statement that things have changed.  We read about college and even high school athletes who have had run-ins with the law and they are freed to continue to play and to cause more ills.<br />What a shame...despite the horrible feeling I got as I read about Josh the book is a quick fast read, that will lure you in and keep you turning pages faster than a Randy Johnson fastball.<br />Enjoy...also try _Heart of a Champion_ by Deuker, and _ Bull Catcher_ by Alden Carter.	2000-04-26

What about the side of the story where the  tree is not happy because of what is expected of her?  Certainly there are  multiple viewpoints of this book, but I will leave you with one:<br />It's  about the mutilations females undergo in the interest of pleasing males.	2000-02-29

A freshman at a private  high school decides to &quot;disturb the universe&quot;, and soon realizes  that he may have  overstepped his bounds. The shifting narrative is very  distinct and unique, yet sometimes confusing. This is a great novel for  classroom discussion with some strong themes: to include, courage &amp;  cowardice, peer pressure, victimization, individualism, good v. evil and  god and religion. The ending is unconventional and truely climatic, can you  remember when you first realized that life is not fair, and sometimes  doesn't come close to being fair? <br />This book opened up the new genre of  YA literature, and Cormier certainly &quot;disturbed the universe&quot;  with its publication. This book is constantly under the eye of parent  groups who would like to see it &quot;banned&quot; or placed on a  restricted list(recently under pressure from a parent's group here in  VA)...because that is the case, it should be required reading for all  teenagers. If you are younger, you may want to read Spinelli's WRINGER: a  story so foul, so horrifying with peer pressure that it should be shelved  next to Cormier's The Chocolate War.<br />As a children's librarian, I will  continue to offer Cormier's books because he refuses to compromise the  truth as he sees it. <br /> For an indepth look at Cormier's writing try:  PRESENTING ROBERT CORMIER Twayne Publishers	2000-01-13

That's the crux of the novel...now the more interesting points and examination of the 1980's and  California lifestyle.<br />Clay is seen as a detached observer while back at  home, despite being apart of the peer group the novel follows around from  club to party, to restaurant.  Look at Clay as an example of Shakespeare's   Hamlet(ailed by Hesitstion).  We ceratinly see Clay's shortcoming when he  fails to react/save the 12 year-old girl who is tied to the bed at the  party.  In this very same scene we see Ellis' theme of the novel: &quot;If  you want something...you have the right to do it.&quot;<br />Throughout the  novel we see the destruction of LA, a city that is prone to excess and  decadence.  Also revealed in the following scenes:  Clay's sisters are  permittd to watch pornographic films, the dog eats a cigarette but(showing  that even animals behave in unnatural ways), we can even look at the hot  weather as a symbol of the apocalypic decline of the city.  One scene that  really stands out of the fall of LA and it's citizens is when Clay's  friends are watching a &quot;snuff&quot; movie-clearly showing that murder  and rape are condoned as entertainment.<br />At the end of the novel we see  Clay leaving LA...we assume to return to school and never  return...Wondering if Ellis ever returned to LA...and wondering when the  catharsis happened?<br />If you enjoy this novel, from contemporary fiction's  &quot;bad-boy&quot;, try _Bright Lights, Big City_ by McInerney, Ellis'  _American Psycho_, and _Mysteries of Pittsburgh_ by Chabon...all three deal  with the seedy life of the american city in the 1980's.	2000-01-12

Certainly I don't want to give away the story-line, but  certainly worth the 75-90 minutes it will take you to read, and like the  review below states, a good introduction to Ayn Rand.	1999-07-10

This time the drug of choice is heroin.  Many people will not  want their children to read books like this, they'll say it will foster the  mindset of promotion of drug abuse, but I don't think that is true.  I have  never taken drugs, and reading about a person taking drugs has never  prompted me to indulge.  (I have also seen 1000's of acts of violence on Tv  and in the movies, and I have yet to committ felonious assault.)  If you  deciede to read this book, please read Go Ask Alice too.  If this book does  not scare you, then I'm not sure what would.	1999-01-04
