He must be since he has gone from writing the Harry Bosch novels to writing about a new well-drawn character, defense lawyer Mickey Haller.<br /><br />Haller is a different breed of cat than Bosch.  Bosch is a heroic figure who is fairly ethical.  Haller, on the other hand, is an anti-hero who is often less than ethical.  Haller works out of his car and defends riff raff.<br /><br />In the Lincoln Lawyer, Haller suffers from an uncharacteristic twinge of conscience.  Also, a crime hits close to home.  These events test his mettle as a defense lawyer almost as much as his oftentimes surly clients do.<br /><br />One thing that is constantly on Haller's mind is this wise sentence uttered by his lawyer father:<br /><br />\\"The scariest client a lawyer will ever have is an innocent client. Because if you [mess] up and he goes to prison, it'll scar you for life.\\"<br /><br />It is this sentence that drives Haller's pursuit of justice and subsequently Michael Connelly's superb new novel The Lincoln Lawyer.

The war on science is a short sighted device by corporate interests acting in conjunction with religious zealots to further special interest agendas.  The war on science threatens the environment that we all live and breathe in as well as our public health. <br /> <br />The war on science is fought with the following tactics: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />1)Create the illusion of controversy amongst scientists where non in fact exists. <br /> <br />2)Demand \\"peer reviews\\" by scientists working for industry. <br /> <br /> <br />3) Politicize science. <br /> <br /> <br />4) Pretend to stand up for \\"sound science\\" as opposed to \\"junk science.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />5) Establish \\"think tanks\\" run by scientists who are actually puppets of big business.   Demand that these  puppet groups have equal time on TV and radio with legitimate scientists and think tanks run by legit scientists. <br /> <br />Mooney's book is a timely and important work that every American who is concerned with issues relating to public health and well being needs to read.	2005-10-12

Many of its critics have taken the position that its wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are unconstitutional.  The War on Terrorism combined with the Bush Administration's decisions regarding both the ABM Treaty and the Kyoto accords have provoked strong allegations that the Constitution's framework for foreign policy has been dismantled. <br /> <br />The author of  The Powers of War and Peace : The Constitution and Foreign Affairs after 9/11, John Yoo, is a former lawyer in the Bush Justice Department.  He argues that the Bush Administration's foreign policy has solid precedent in the actions of previous administrations. <br /> <br /> <br />Yoo points out that from the Undeclared Naval War With France in 1798 through Bill Clinton's war in Kosovo in 1999, American presidents have often prosecuted armed conflicts without formal declarations of war.  He argues that the Constitution grants different powers over foreign policy to Congress, the courts and the presidency, requiring these institutions to negotiate what the country's foreign policy is.  Yoo's argument is based on the original intent of the Founding Fathers supplemented with constitutional law and history.   <br /> <br />For instance, Yoo argues that just because a war is undeclared does not mean that it is unconstitutional.  He points out that Congress's power of the purse gives it an effective veto power over executive decisions to go to war.  He also points out that the 1973 War Powers Resolution has been systematically violated and has been treated as being de facto unconstituitional almost since the day that it was passed.  He also argues that Congressional resolutions for war are legally unnecessary and serve only a political purpose in demonstrating unity in foreign policy and war.   <br /> <br />Yoo makes a number of arguments that are bound to provoke controversy.  For instance, he argues that the Constitutionallows the government to violate international law whenever it wants to.  Yoo also holds the position that captured terrorists are not covered under the Geneva Convention since they are not combatants belonging to another country and by didnt of being terrorists did not obey the laws of war.   <br /> <br />The Powers of War and Peace : The Constitution and Foreign Affairs after 9/11 by John Yoo is an excellent work that is sure to ignite controversy and nationwide discussion/debate over these important subjects.	2005-10-12

He was also notable for the sheer number of appearances that he made on TV game shows such as the \\"Hollywood Squares\\" where he was a regular for many years. In other words, Paul Lynde was one of many actors who had a lucrative career, yet who was hardly a household name. He was both rich and obscure, able to enjoy the Hollywood life without having to put up with the likes of the paparazzi. <br /> <br />Now, however, that obscurity has been lifted with the publication of Center Square: The Paul Lynde Story by Steve Wilson and Joe Florenski. Paul Lynde's life story has been revealed for the tragedy that it really was. Here was a man who was at one point making $50,000 a week during most of the 1970's, yet considered himself a failure because he never had a starring role in a major motion picture. This despite his previously cited accomplishments in addtion to significant supporting roles on such movies as \\"Bye Bye Birdie,\\" \\"The Glass Bottom Boat,\\" \\"New Faces,\\" and \\"Send Me No Flowers.\\" He also supplied the voice of Templeton the Rat in the animated classic \\"Charlotte's Web.\\" Most folks would consider that to be a pretty successful career. <br /> <br />The main reason why Lynde failed to land a starring role in a movie was because he simply could not say no to any offer. As a result, he was constantly working and casting directors came to assume that Lynde was simply too busy doing game shows and the like to take on a major role. Additionally, he became typecast in Hollywood as a sitcom guest star and game show participant and not as a serious actor. <br /> <br />Center Square: The Paul Lynde Story is a solid book.  Center Square: The Paul Lynde Story is heartily recommended as a book about Hollywood that goes beyond the fluff and gloss found in most other books about filmdom and TV-land.	2005-10-09

It is one of those \\"quickie\\" books that takes only a superficial look at its subject. There is little on how Meyer was able to pull off the feat of going from the professional disgrace of the porno flick racket to becoming a big budget Hollywood filmmaker.

Actually, her novel reads more like a thriller than either romance or horror, but its very well done and much more interesting than most vampire novels are these days. <br /> <br />There is one major drawback in that it was never clearly explained just how the mistreated half sister of the real Lady Simone Gilbert was able to take her deceased half sister's place and masquerade as her so much so that she could deceive everyone of her half sister's acqualintances that she really was Lady Simone Gilbert.  However, the rest of Raleigh's novel is so well done that by the time you are finished reading it, you really do not care that much about this particular deficiency.	2005-10-03

It covers the rock music TV scene from Dick Clark's \\"American Bandstand\\" show through the troubled \\"American Idol.\\" Its author is Jake Austen, producer of the popular Chic-A-Go-Go show on Chicagoland Public Access cable channnels, so he is in a position to know about this subject. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, TV-a-Go-Go : Rock on TV from American Bandstand to American Idol  falls well short of the mark. It is one of those \\"quickie\\" books that takes only a superficial look at its subject. Many of its assertions are  questionable. For instance, Austen claims that punk rock only became popular after the band Fear was on \\"Saturday Night Live\\" in 1981. Actually, punk rock was popular before 1981 and it was the result of that popularity that Fear made it on the show. <br /> <br />Austen claims that many classic cartoons such as \\"Alvin and the Chipmunks\\" and \\"The Banana Splits\\" were examples of rock TV. Well, this writer grew up watching those shows and the only way that you can classify those shows as rock music oriented is if your definition of rock music is so broad as to include everything from the William Tell Overture aka the \\"Lone Ranger\\" music to Garth Brooks. In other words, its a ridiculous assertion. <br /> <br />There are other problems with this book. There is practically nothing about the sleazy likes of Alan Freed and the payola scandals that shook the rock music scene during the late 1950's and the early 1960's. There is also nothing about the spread of perversion and immorality into rock music, which began as clean music. There is little about the local and regional rock TV shows, which is strange since the author is the producer of one such show. <br /> <br />The basic problem with TV-a-Go-Go : Rock on TV from American Bandstand to American Idol , is that for all its claims of being the definitive book on its subject, there really is little new about its subject. Almost everything in it was originally published in other, better books. You would be much better off hunting down those books in your local public library rather than plunking down your hard earned money for this book. <br /> <br />TV-a-Go-Go : Rock on TV from American Bandstand to American Idol is a book about an interesting subject that is in itself less than interesting.	2005-10-01

This decision invalidated the ruling in the 1896 Plessy vs. Ferguson case that held that segregated facilities were acceptable as long they were &quot;separate but equal.&quot;  The court also overruled a lower court ruling that the Topeka schools were substantially equal and hence constitutional. <br />In reaching its decision the court found that it was inconclusive if the original framers of the 14th Amendment intended to outlaw segregation in educational facilities.  Actually, it is clear from the historical record that the authors of the 14th Amendment did not intend banning such segregation.  The court also took the attitude that social circumstances had changed regarding the role of public education since 1896 so much that the court simply could not be held by the Plessy ruling any more. The court also took the position that segregation was inherently harmful to minority groups.  <br />Another related case to Brown was the Bolling case regarding school segregation in the District of Columbia.  In this case, the court held that the 5th Amendment applied to racial segregation. In the Brown and Bolling decisions, the court held that referees should be appointed by the lower courts to supervise the end of segregation.   <BR>   <BR>The court decisions in the Brown and Bolling cases were written in very brief texts.  They failed to convincingly explain to a skeptical public just why it was that segregation was unconstitutional.  They also did not quote the lone dissenter in the Plessy decision, John Marshall Harlan, on just why segregation was inherently unconstitutional.  <BR> <BR>The content of the actual court rulings reveal that the justices failed to properly understand the evility of segregation.  This showed a basic ignorance of the justices of the effects of racism upon minorities.  The record also shows that Chief Justice Earl Warren prized public relations over doing his duty.  Additionally, in an effort for an unanimous decision, the actual ruling in Brown was severely watered down.  By doing so, the court inadvertently signaled the segregationists that it really was not serious about enforcing equality in the land.  The end result was that a decade later, there was little real progress made towards racial integration in the Deep South.  <br />As the above shows, Kluger's volume about Brown vs. Topeka Board of Education contains plenty of sharp opinions about the Brown case and its true role in the history of American race relations. <BR>Kluger's book is also an invaluable source of information about the folks who actually filed the historic lawsuits in the first place.  <br />Kluger's book also contains masterful character sketches of the leading figures behind the historic Supreme Court decisions.  One of these heroes was the flawed Earl Warren who had earlier supported the mass detainment of Japanese Americans during World War II.  <BR> <BR>The principal hero in Kluger's mind, is Thurgood Marshall.  Marshall was a tireless crusader for civil rights.  Marshall had been the head of the NAACP's legal division since 1938.  Initially, Marshall refrained from contronting the Plessy decision head on because he realized that doing so would be counter productive.  That being the case, Marshall endeavored to win victories for minorities within the separate but equal guidelines.  This strategy resulted in a string of victories that encouraged Marshall to challenge the Plessy ruling.  <br />Unlike most other authors of books about the history of civil rights, Kluger does not laud Marshall for being a latter day saint.  Kluger's portrait of Marshall is both fair and balanced and takes note of Marshall's flaws.<br />Simple Justice is a classic work about civil rights history and as such should be required reading in American History classes.	2004-07-12

This was an attempt at an alternative school that went unaccredited throughout its existence.<br />The Jack Kerouac School was both founded and lead by Allen Ginsberg.  Among its alumni were such luminaries as William Burroughs, Gregory Corso, Ann Waldman as well as Ginsberg himself.<br />Kashner kept copious notes and a diary in which he recorded the various goings on at the school.  That being the case, When I Was Cool offers readers a portrait of a time and  place and people that has since gone by the wayside.

Nastase was noted for his frequent temper tantrums and other forms of misbehavior which stands in sharp contrast to the polite tennis stars of today.  He was also noted for playing tennis all over the world in all sorts of unlikely places simply for the thrill of it. By 1973, he was the highest ranking tennis player in the world.  <br />Also in 1973, he obeyed the order of Romania's Communist dictator to play Wimbledon despite the fact that there was an international group of players that was boycotting the tournament.  He also built a reputation as a ladies man who had affairs with numerous beauties.  <br />Nastase defected to the West after 1973 so that he could enjoy both freedom and the ability to both go pro and keep the money he earned instead of turning it over to the Communist dictatorship in his Romanian homeland.  Following his retirement from tennis in 1984, Nastase did a number of interesting things ranging from writing a pair of novels in French to running for mayor of Bucharest in 1996.<br /> As his motto goes, &quot;My ambition is to do a good job.

Historically, its culture has been based on that of Europe.  However, there are waves of new immigrants from Latin America who refuse to assimilate and who stubbornly hold on to their non-Eropean culture.  <br />Carlson also holds that America has been down the wrong path ever since the New Deal when there was a massive increase in the size and role of the Federal Government.  <br />According to Carlson, family and community have been the cornerstones of American culture ever since colonial times.  This culture included the idea that men were dominant and Protestantism was the dominant religion.  <br />Also acording to Carlson, prior to the New Deal, social welfare was handled by private agencies, many of which were created by German-Americans before 1900.  There was also a moral consensus that aided the growth of the American nation.  That consensus has since collapsed.  <br />The role of family in American culture has been undermined by government policies such as outlawing workplace discrimination against women.  <br />Carlson's book is a bit gloomy, but it is still an excellent review of the better aspects of traditional American culture.	2004-07-10

Col. Robert &quot;Buzz&quot; Patterson is an excellent book about how a certain political faction is utterly unfit to handle U.S. military and foreign policy.  <br />According to Patterson, anti Vietnam War leftists took over the Democrat Party in the early 1970's and have retained power over it ever since.  John Kerry is a &quot;Trojan Horse&quot; of the far left in that he is a military veteran who subscribes to its hatred of America philosophy.<br />According to Patterson, Kerry is a hypocrite for attacking Bush's National Guard service since Kerry originally attempted to have his student deferment extended by transferring to a French university.  Upon arrival in Vietnam, Kerry did all he could to accumulate as many medals as he could so he could later use them for political advantage.  Kerry even made his own home movie in which he had his crew re-enact his shooting of an enemy soldier so that he could impress the folks back home with his bravery.<br />According to Patterson, Kerry astounded his fellow officers and soldiers with his reckless demands for multiple Purple Hearts for even the most minor wounds.  Some of his crew even suspected Kerry of self-inflicting some of those wounds.  Also, just after leaving the U.S. Navy, Kerry met with a North Vietnamese official in Paris in what Patterson believes mavy have been a treasonous act.  Additionally, Kerry's subsequent anti-war speeches were used as propaganda by the Communist enemy who used them in their torture of captured Americans.  <br />Reckless Disregard is a powerful book about both a dangerous man and a political party that is literally out of control.  It is must reading for all patriotic Americans.	2004-07-10

Morgan argues, with some persuasiveness, that the internal subversion of America by pro-Soviet forces began right then and there.<br />The U.S. Government mobilized to fight this menace and as a result, the Cold War according to Morgan really began in 1917, instead of 1947 as traditional historians would have you believe.  In Morgan's narrative, the fight against Communist espionage and treason in America had periods of intense public awareness (1919-1920, 1947-1954) and other, longer periods of public indifference such as the 1930's.  <br />Morgan's book is an uneven effort.  It alternates between intensely interesting portions and utterly boring parts.

Klarman's book  From Jim Crow to Civil Rights: The Supreme Court and the Struggle for Racial Equality is the best book written about civil rights in America in quite some time.  Klarman's book is one of the few works about the civil rights movement that analyzes the significant change that occurred in racial attitudes during 1900-1954 as well as the movement itself.<BR>  <BR>Klarman's book is a revisionist account that downplays the importance of the 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education case.  Klarman contends that there would have been a civil rights movement even if the Supreme Court had ruled the other way in Brown.  Klarman believes that the conventional history gives court rulings too much credit for effecting change in America. Essentially, Klarman believes that the federal court system is actually very weak and does not affect America much in the long run.  <br />Klarman believes, for instance, that the White Court's civil rights rulings during the Progressive Era did nothing to help blacks.  Other than the Smith case of 1944, Klarman does not believe that Supreme Court rulings helped black Americans.  In the Smith case, Klarman holds that it effectively opened the door for some black participation in Southern politics.  <br />A large part of Klarman's book is devoted to debunking the idea that the Brown ruling helped speed the civil rights movement. Klarman holds that the Brown decision did little to inspire blacks to seek redress for racial grievances.  He does, however, concede that the media coverage of Brown did help raise consciousness among white folks about racial injustice in the South.  <br />Klarman's book is a revisionist account of civil rights history. It is well-written, makes its points well and is  backed up by prodigious research.  It deserves a wide audience.	2004-07-03

He has made movies and television shows and written books about the contemporary American scene.  There are many who love him and others who hate him with very few folks who are in between the two extremes.  <br />Both Jason Clarke and David T. Hardy can be counted among the critics of Michael Moore.  They are the creators of the popular MooreLies.com and MooreExposed.com websites that are dedicated to exposing what they consider to be the wholesale falsehoods of Michael Moore.  They contend that Moore's documentaries are so far off base they really should be called \\"crockumentaries.\\"<br />According to Clarke and Hardy, Moore bends the facts to fit a predetermined thesis.  He doctors film footage, manipulates facts and takes excerpts out of speeches completely out of context by doing so tampers with the truth.  He has also gotten in trouble for this tendency.  For example, Warner Brothers was forced to pay legal damages to a man who was unfairly denigrated in Moore's first film, Roger and Me.  <br />According to Clarke and Hardy, Moore is a man who pretends to be a man of the downtrodden even though he lives in Manhattan, is rich, and enjoys a luxurious lifestyle.  Additionally, they point out that although Moore has often claimed that he comes from a blue collar family, he is really from an affluent background.  They say that Moore's denunciations of rich white people is only an act.  <br />According to Clarke and Hardy, Moore's documentary Bowling for Columbine is \\"as manipulative as totalitarian propaganda.\\"  In that same film, he made Charlton Heston, a personal friend of Martin Luther King and a supporter of civil rights in the 1960's, out to be a racist nut via \\"creative\\" editing and manipulating the evidence.  <br />According to Clarke and Hardy, Moore's attacks on Heston were especially interesting in light of his own racial problems.  For instance, just after 9/11 Moore made what many consider to be vicious racist slurs on an European speaking tour.  <br />Essentially, Clarke and Hardy's  argument is that Michael Moore is a fraud who lusts for  political power, public attention and above all, money.	2004-06-29

Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser to Jimmy Carter, is a critic of the neoconservative approach to foreign policy.  The neocons believe that might is right and therefore the U.S. should assert its will over the world.  Brzezinski, however, favors a much more subtle approach.<br />Brzezinski's approach is using U.S. influence to improve the world instead of bullying the rest of the world around with military might.  For example, Brzezinski favors withholding U.S. aid to Israel to cause that country to withdraw from the occupied territories and recognize an independent Palestinian state.  He also favors alliances with friendly regimes in the Islamic world.  <br />Brzezinski's ideas are pretty much the same as those which guided the Carter Administration.  However, now that there is no such thing as either the Cold War or the Soviet Union, those ideas may very well have a better chance of succeeding.  Perhaps a future president will implement Brzezinski's ideas.<br />This is an intelligent and closely argued book.  Brzezinski marshals his evidence and his arguments to a highly persuasive effect.  This book also avoids the Mr. Know-It-All tone that pervades so many other books written by former government officials.	2004-06-29

He was a leading propagandist for the Soviet Union in both Europe and North America.  However, he was not particularly skillful at propaganda, with the result that his efforts constituted a waste of precious Communist funds.  He also lacked political acumen as shown by the fact that he believed that Adolf Hitler had no chance for victory in the Weimar Republic. <br />However, he was able to persuade several major European business leaders to donate money to the Communist cause.  The book did not adequately explain just why these businessmen would contribute to a cause dedicated to their demise.  <br />After spending about a decade and a half wasting the money supplied to him by the Soviet Union, Munzenberg came to something of a break with Moscow.  The book really did not explain this break very well.  <br />During the last four years of his life, 1936-1940, Munzenberg increasingly distanced himself from Moscow and his rhetoric and writings took a decidedly more anti-Soviet nature.  He even engaged in a correspondence with Soviet dictator Josef Stalin's chief rival, Leon Trotsky.  In 1940, following the conquest of France by the Nazis, Munzenberg was found hanging from a tree.  It is still not known if it was a suicide or a murder.  <br />This is a decent biography of a forgotten propagandist for a now dead cause.  It is very well-written and is very well-sourced.  However, there are some major flaws to it.  For example, the book fails to explain why Munzenberg consistently made western Europe his main focus even though he had much greater success in fund raising and in converting writers and others to the Communist cause in North America.  Also, the book does not explain why Munzenberg stayed in France even when it became clear that country was doomed to a Nazi takeover.  Finally, the book does not explain why the Soviets continued provideMunzenberg with major funding for Munzenberg's continual failures in both promoting Communism and in opposing the rise of Fascism.  <br />With all this in mind, The Red Millionaire rates a rating of 4 out of 5.	2004-06-29

Hosts rely on stirring up passions by making ad hominem attacks and by twisting/distorting facts to fit preconceived views.  Radio talk shows are generally dishonest and are a very poor source of reliable information.  <br />One prominent radio talk show host is Sean Hannity who has written a book entitled Deliver Us From Evil.  Hannity directs his attacks on \\"liberals\\" whom he claims are responsible for all that is rotten in the world.  Hannity goes as far as to claim that liberals, either because they are evil or stupid or possibly both, are responsible for the existence of terrorism in the world.<br />According to Hannity, all liberals are either \\"appeasers\\" who engage in \\"appeasement\\" of tyrants and terrorists or they engage in \\"accomodation\\" with such evil people.  Hannity continually throws around such red meat phrases as \\"pure human wickedness\\" and \\"absolute and aggressive\\" to characterize those who he disagrees with.  One chapter is even entitled, \\"Terrorism, Despotism and Liberalism\\" as if there are no real differences between terrorists, despots and liberals.  <br />According to Hannity, everyone who disagrees with the Bush Administration on how to fight terrorism is either evil or stupid.  <BR>He says that anyone who disagrees with the Bush anti-terrorism strategy are members of the \\"antiwar lunatic fringe\\" and are nothing more than \\"mindless pacifists.\\"  <br />Essentially, what Hannity does in this book is tell the hard core listeners to his talk show exactly what they want to hear.  All liberals are either evil or stupid.  Anyone who disagrees with George W. Bush on what to do about terrorism is either a fool or a traitor or a mental case.  <br />If you are interested in reading a book that is both honest and informative, this is not for you.  Books such as Deliver Us From Evil do nothing to further the policy debate in this country and, if anything, poison it.	2004-06-29

It has richly drawn characters, lots of suspense and a strict adherence to historical fact.  In short, it is a great read.  If Saylor had the judgment to end his novel with the first 300+ pages, I would have given it a 5-star rating without any reservations.<br />However, such is not the case.  The reason is that Saylor either decided to throw in one final plot twist or his editors compelled him to do so.  This twist contradicts both established historical facts and also the facts of the case that was laid out in the previous 300+ pages.  It is also written in such a way that it literally violates the suspension of disbelief that is vital to any enjoyable escape reading.  The reader feels cheated at the end of the novel.  <br />Due to the merits of the first 300+ pages, I still give this a 3 out of 5 star rating, but it could have been a 5 all the way.	2004-06-29

The real Pony Express existed for only 18 months, but Hollywood has made it appear to be a long lasting agency.  The company itself left very few records, making it difficult for the serious historian to write about it.<br />Christopher Corbett's Orphans Preferred is the best book thus far to tackle the Pony Express.  The first part is the most thorough history of the ill-fated company ever written.  It makes the most use of the scanty records available.  The second part is a look at how such a marginal enterprise that lasted for less time than many television shows today do made such an impact on American mythology.  <br />This is an excellent book on a subject that had previously defied the efforts of many good historians before Corbett came along.	2004-06-25

Marcinkus was corrupt and he placed the Holy See's investments in the hands of Roberto Calvi and Michele Sidona, both of whom were Mafia-connected bankers.  Their corruption lead to the collapse of the Banco Ambrosiano in 1982 and caused the exposure of one of the greatest scandals in Papal history.  <br />Where it stays on focus on this scandal, Paul L. Williams's The Vatican Exposed: Money, Murder, and the Mafia is an excellent work.  However, when it strays from this scandal into other aspects of the Vatican's finances, this book gets shaky.  Williams simply bites off more than he can chew.<br />For instance, Williams calls the Vatican's financing of anti-Communist efforts during the Cold War a scandal.  But is not sticking up for your fellow Catholics against atheistic dictatorship a fundamental duty of a church?  Also, he attempts to link the Vatican to other financial scandals often without any real proof.  In other words, he tries to make the Vatican out to be more corrupt than it really is.  <br />Ths book is worth reading only as far as the Marcinkus scandal is concerned.  After that, it becomes not much more than shallow sensationalism and bad reporting.	2004-06-19

It concerns the steps that were taken in creating the USA from the attempted Alabany Plan of Union in 1754 to the inauguration of Thomas Jefferson in 1801 that marked the first time in American history where control of the presidency was transferred from one party to another.  <br />According to Ferling, there were two principal questions that informed the debate that lead to the creation of the American form of government:  (A) what was the true relationship of the states to each other and to the federal government and (B) what  was the true meaning of the term &quot;republican form of government&quot; that nearly everyone agreed should be the type of government that America should have.  <br />A Leap in the Dark is a historical work at its best.  Ferling combines in-depth historical research with writing that is easy to read.  No academic stuffiness here.  This book should be required reading in undergraduate history classes.	2004-06-19

It is also his best.<br />This novel has both good plotting and an otherworldly atmosphere that pervades the book.  The setting is 1920's New England where there was a revival in interest in the occult.  However, the key to the tale is the 18th Century New England scene that Lovecraft had a lifetime interest in.  <br />The character of Charles Dexter Ward was based on Lovecraft himself:  a lonely intellectual who was an antiquarian who detested the Industrial Revolution.  Ward's research into the occult leads to the reincarnation of one of his ancestors who in turn hatches a plot with both Ward and one of Ward's friends for a mass resurrection of the dead who would become mindless zombies dedicated to both the destruction of heavy industry in America as well as the forced expulsion, if not mass murder,  of the Roman Catholic immigrants who Lovecraft detested so much from America.  <br />The Case of Charles Dexter Ward is a fantasy/horror novel that tells you a lot about its author.  H.P. Lovecraft was a self-styled aristocrat from a decadent Old Money family who bitterly hated the Roman Catholic Church and especially the Irish and Italian immigrants who by 1928, when this novel was first published, had already assumed a position of political power at the expense of the WASP elite that Lovecraft was a member of.  Clearly, The Case of Charles Dexter Ward was reflective of Lovecraft's religious bigotry and his hateful tendencies towards certain ethnic and religious groups.  It should come as no surprise that during the 1930's, Lovecraft frequently praised Adolf Hitler and the Nazis.<br />The Case of Charles Dexter Ward is a uniquely powerful and compelling work by a master of horror fantasy.	2004-06-18

It is about one James Tilly Matthews who was declared insane for his beliefs about treason at the highest levels of the British Government during the French Revolutionary/Napoleonic period.  As it turns out, Matthews was actually right to some extent and as a former spy, was in a good position to be able to determine if there really was treasonous activities in the British government at the time.  Matthews's case became a cause clebre and he was eventually released from the insane asylum and eventually started an architecture magazine and even submitted plans for an insane asylum.  <br />This is an excellent book dealing with a most fascinating episode in British history.	2004-06-18

According to Morris, \\"All public figures use makeup to cover a blemish or two.   But only Hillary wears a mask of so many layers, one that hides her true face altogether.\\"  <br />According to Morris, Hillary Clinton is an even more accomplished liar than her husband is.  One such lie is the claim she made on the Today Show that daughter Chelsea was in harms way at the World Trade Center.  Hillary is an extremely materialisic woman who is extremely greedy.  As such, there is a strong likelihood that Hillary will one day become embroiled in a politically suicidal financial scandal.<br />According to Morris, Hillary has  a strong propensity to use private eyes and skullduggery for political purposes.  If Hillary were to become elected in 2008, it would be like Richard Nixon all over again.  <br />Essentially, Morris's argument is that Hillary Clinton is a fraud who lusts for supreme political power and who, if she should ever attain it, will be the biggest threat to democracy in America since the days of the Nixon presidency.	2004-06-17

The Venus Throw is supposed to be an ancient historical mystery.  That is, a mystery novel that is set in ancient history.  Problem is that there is no real mystery and the historical detail is faulty.  This is a novel in which the characters act like modern day folks instead of authentic Romans.<br />The novel starts out with the murder of an Egyptian ambassador to Rome.  However, the reader can easily figure out just who did it in just the first few chapters.  The only thing that the rest of the book does is to provide the &quot;why&quot; in the whodunit.  The explanation as to the motives behind the murder is laughable.  <br />Basically, this is a novelette with about 250 pages of padding which makes for dull reading.  There is hardly any suspense in this suspense novel.  The characters, save for Clodia, are not particularly well drawn and are generally not much more than mere cardboard.  There are several historical errors as well that mar the learning experience that you are supposed to have while reading a historical novel.  <br />In sum, The Venus Throw is a novel to avoid.	2004-06-17

Additionally, this book includes  the alleged suicide of a female musician and the still unsolved murder of a police officer both of which directly tie in with the death of Cobain.

In the 12th Century, there was a work entitled The Book of Chess that doubled as a plea for women's rights.

All too often, Hollywood acquiesces to their demands.   The military believes that they are only enforcing accuracy, but they also maintain that any film that does not reflect well on the military is &quot;inaccurate.&quot;<br />This baleful influence has altered the view that Americans now have of the military.

That's what author Jonah Raskin has to say in this new book.  According to Raskin, the likes of Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs were not  devoted artists who shunned fame and fortune.  <br />Instead, Ginsberg actively sought fame and fortune, but did so in an unconventional way.  Specifically, Ginsberg's epic poem Howl was purposely written to create controversy which lead to notoriety and eventually a lot of money.  Ginsberg also set up a Bhuddist institute in Colorado to capitalize on his fame.<br />The institute also served Ginsberg's need to cultivate publicity and raise large amounts of money without appearing to &quot;sell out.&quot;    The institute also ran a school for aspiring writers that included a faculty consisting of many other leading Beat Generation writers.  <br />In recognizing fact that so many Beat Generation writers praised poverty while enjoying quite materialistic lives, author Raskin has shattered the myth of the Beat Generation.  If anything, the Beats's writing  had more in common with the hackneyed horror fiction of H.P. Lovecraft than with anything truly original.<br />This book is an excellent contribution to the literature about the Beat Generation.	2004-06-09

His views on Iraq have been long known in Washington, D.C.<br />However, what's really important about this book is that it is co-authored by Tom Clancy.  This is interesting since Clancy is the popular fiction author who has been the most visibly aligned with the Republican Party. In all of his novels published before the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990's, the bad guys were always Communists.  Additionally, liberal activists were labeled in nearly all of these novels as constituting a fifth column for Communism.  In other words, Clancy's fiction doubled as both endorsements for Republican policies and slams on Democrats.<br />In Battle Ready, both Clancy and Zinni continue on the theme of denouncing left wingers for being unpatriotic while also denouncing Bush and his Iraq policy.   Clancy and Zinni contend that a conservative president who is reckless with using the military is just as bad as a liberal president who is overly pacifistic.  If this argument resonates in the heartland, then Bush is in serious trouble.	2004-06-09

In Rubicon, Saylor does not use any of the lush characterization or attention to historical detail that he used in his previous novels in the Gordianus the Finder series.  <br />Even worse, was the fact that this is a mystery novel without a real mystery.  The reader is able to figure out whodunit very early on in the book.  However, the detective Gordianus the Finder does not reveal the solution until after going through a series of contrived incidents that violate the readers's suspension of disbelief.  The only reason why the solution was not revealed early on is that this would have made Rubicon no more than a novelette.

Bush Administration, it has become increasingly clear that the folks who run foreign policy do not reflect what most American think.  As aurhor James Mann has brilliantly delineated his magisterial new book, &quot;Rise of the Vulcans,&quot; American foreign policy is now in the hands of a small neoconservative clique who like to refer to themselves as &quot;Vulcans.&quot;  <br />Almost none of these neoconservatives  served in the armed forces and most of them sought out deferments with the zeal of antiwar activists, with Vice President Richard Cheney getting five of them because, \\"I had other priorities.\\" Yet neoconservative foreign  policy is   devoted to using military force, in practically every  scenario. <br />These neoconservatives are war hawks who relish war even though they were draft dodgers themselves.  For instance, before the '91 war with Iraq, then Defense Secretary Cheney and his chief aide Paul Wolfowitz immediately began devising their own war plan \\"without telling Powell or anyone else on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\\" <br />James Mann's book   is quite comparable to  David Halberstam's classic &quot;Best and Brightest&quot; about the Kennedy/Johnson foreign policy team.

Pledged is the result of intensive research into sororities.  One fascinating aspect of Pledged is the extent to which Satanic-like rituals play a role in many sororities today.  Also revealing is just how much alcohol and illegal drugs are at the center of sorority life today.  Robbins also reveals how much of a role that peer pressure at sororities plays a role in young women becoming dangerously anorexic, not to mention neurotic.  Another interesting relevation is that while community service was stressed back in the 1950's, today's &quot;Greek&quot; campus organizations perform almost zero community service.  Robbins does a service in exposing  the fact that  sorority members  generally earn worse grades, suffer more alcohol-related trauma, engage in more perversion, have a higher rate of anorexia and bulimia  than the rest of the student body on campuses today.  <br />Every parent of a girl who wants to go to college needs to  read this book.	2004-06-03

Although most folks today have never heard of Fischer, he was one of the pioneers of hardboiled detective fiction.  As such, this book is a real treat for mystery lovers.  One note of caution:  The stories in this book reflect the prejudices of the times.  Modern day audiences are likely to find some of the elements in some of the stories offensive.  That being the case, this book is an excellent artifact of politically incorrect times gone by.	2004-06-03

Parenti reveals, for instance, that one of the first uses of fingerprinting was as a method of keeping Indians on the reservation.  Especially interesting is Parenti's revelation of the widespread government domestic spying apparatus used to harry  critics of the American political establishment, especially under the reign of J. Edgar Hoover as FBI director.<br />The only real drawback to Parenti's book is that he gives but little coverage to recent instruments of repression such as the Patriot act.  Other than his skimpy coverage of the last few years, Parenti's book is recommended reading for Americans concerned with governmental intrusions on civil liberties.	2004-06-03

However, poor sales restricted October Dreams to the initial 1989 bok.  When it was published, most of the authors were fairly obscure writers.  Now, many of them such as Mel Odom, Ken Wiseman and editor David Kubicek have become fairly well known among horror fans.<br />The stories range in length from Steve Vernon's excellent short-short story, &quot;Beat Well&quot; to Robert C. Guenzel Jr.'s novelette, &quot;A Divine Comedy.&quot;  October Dreams is a must have item for every horror book collector.  I heartily recommend it.	2004-06-03

The Norman Podhoretz Reader is one such book.  Norman Podhoretz pretends to be a sophisticated thinker, however the essays in this book reveal him to be a fairly simplistic person, at least as far as politics are concerned.<br />For instance, Podhoretz maintains that any and all criticism of Israel is motivated by anti-semitism.  Also, he holds that criticism of the U.S. involvement in Vietnam is motivated by anti-Americanism.  In other words, if you disagree with Podhoretz on the vital issues of the day, then you must have ulterior motives for doing so.  Folks, this is comic book thinking.<br />I give this book 2 stars only because there are a number of interesting essays concerning some of Podhoretz's literary contemporaries such as Norman Mailer and Philip Roth.  It is literary criticism, not political pontificating where Podhoretz's true strengths lie and unfortunately, Podhoretz's intellectual energies during the past 25 years or so have been almost entirely consumed by politics.	2004-06-03

This particular novel is set in Egypt, which appears to be outside Saylor's area of expertise.  I'm not trying to pass myself off as any sort of Egyptian history scholar, but I have always been fascinated by ancient Egypt, and there are a number of factual errors in Saylor's historical account.  While it is true that these are mainly minor errors, they are still errors nonetheless.  One thing that all historical fiction writers should strive to do is be 100% factually accurate so that the reader can learn history while escaping from reality.<br />Even worse than the history, is the lack of a real mystery in what is supposed to be a &quot;historical mystery&quot; novel.  Yes, Gordianus the Finder does take on a case, but its one that the reader is able to figure out long before the detective does.  In any event, Gordianus is more concerned in this book with finding a cure for his wife's illness than with the case.  <br />Steven Saylor has written novels that range from  pretty good to not good at all.  Of all his books that this writer has read so far, this is the worst one of them all.	2004-06-03
US	36749329	RITB70JYHEEVP	0972085939	575928158	The Fear Report	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Very Good Collection of Short Horror Stories	Elizabeth Massie has written 23 previous books ranging from horror to historical nonfiction. She is also a seasoned short story writer who has been published in such  small press horror  magazines such as Cemetery Dance, The Horror Show, Bizarre Bazaar, Footsteps, Weirdbook and Deathrealm. Her first short story collection, Southern Discomfort was published in  in 1993 and established her as a major horror writer in the eyes of her peers. However, this respect has not translated into best selling status.  This is largely due to the fact that many major publishing houses will not touch her &quot;controversial&quot; horror fiction with the result that her anthologies are published by small outfits with equally small press runs and promotion budgets.   Fear Report, her most recent collection, is a major anthology of Massie's short horror stories.  Many of these  stories have never before been anthologized.  <br />If you have never before read any of Massie's horror stories, then this is a good book to start with.  An added bonus is that 2 of the stories in this volume were written by Massie in collaboration with her 2 children.  These are actually the best stories in the book.  <br />I rate this book as being 4 out of 5 stars because of one troubling aspect of many of these stories:  their using offensive stereotypes of folks who live in the Appalachian Mountains.  Massie uses words like &quot;redneck&quot; and &quot;hillbillies&quot; and other prejudicial language about folks who are like you and me who just happen to live in a rugged part of the USA.	2004-06-03

One reason for this was the fact that he ran Yale in such a way that the university almost completely escaped the tumult that wracked other campuses during the Vietnam War.   Another reason is that he revamped the admissons policy at yale so that poorly achieving students at prep academies such as Andover could not get in Yale over high achieving public school graduates.  <br />It was in this area of expanding the elite educational experience  at Yale  to all Americans, not just members of the WASP elite that Brewster did his most signal public service.  Brewster was truly an agent of change.  This was most interesting in light of the fact that Brewster was born to a comfortable upper class family, which is precisely the sort of background one would think would spawn conservative thinking.  Brewster's activism began back when he was a big man on campus as a Yale undergraduate.  <br />Interestingly enough, Brewster was also one of the founders of the America First Committee that many Americans today regard as being a right wing outfit.  Actually, as the author of this book points out, America First was originally a left-wing group and many of its most prominent members were left wing activists.  After America's entry into World War II, America First dissolved and Brewster wholeheartedly took up America's cause against the Axis Powers.  <br />It may surprise many Americans today that the Republican party used to have a strong left wing and Brewster was both a stalwart liberal and Republican.  It was for this reason that Brewster was never offered a position in the Kennedy Administration. <br />As university president, Brewster initiated a wide body of reform on campus.   Unlike most campus administrators of his time, Brewster did not resort to repression of dissent during the Vietnam War.  In fact, Brewster publically sympathized with the radicals on many issues.  After resigning from the presidency of Yale in 1977, he became the U.S. ambassador to Britain.  After leaving the diplomatic service, he retired from public life and passed away as the 1980's were drawing to a close.  <br />Kingman Brewster was an important American who held an important position as Yale University president.  Geoffrey Kabaservice has done a public service in writing this book about a forgotten man in American history.	2004-06-03

Leamer's book was an objective look at the radical avant garde and the publications spawned by the radical youth movement.  <br />Leamer's book begins with a look at the precursors of the underground press, namely with the socialist press that was suppressed following America's entry into World War I.  It should surprise most folks, including many historians, that in the pre-WWI era, there were over 100 socialist newspapers in America, of which half a dozen were dailies.  <br />After WWI, there was a lull of about three decades before there was a new flowering of the radical press in the USA.  This trend began with the Guardian which started as the national newspaper of the Henry Wallace for President campaign in 1948.  The Guardian was followed by the Village Voice and then by The Realist.  <br />These publications became the role models for the underground newspapers of the 1960's.  Underground newspapers were the cutting edge of the revolutionary youth movement and as such were also one of the first areas of the movement to wither and die away following the end of the Vietnam War.  <br />Leamer's work was a survey of the underground press and was based on interviews with a large number of its participants and also a review of many of the leading radical youth newspapers.  As such, it is invaluable because it captured the ideas and values of the editors and writers as they really were during the early 1970's and is not some weepy nostalgia for good old days that never were or an attempt at revisionist history.  It is also valuable because many of the underground press veterans are no longer with us.  <br />I give this book 4 stars.   This is because Leamer was too credulous with claims of &quot;repression&quot; that were made by underground journalists.  Also, he failed to realize that the strength of both the radical youth movement and its press derived from mass discontent with a single issue:  the Vietnam War.  Indeed, within 5 years of this book's publication all but a small handful of the newspapers covered by Leamer's work were defunct.	2004-06-02

In the author's introduction, Dickerson says that she aims at making the case that blacks should get away from obsessing over past grievances such as slavery and Jim Crow and take full responsibility for the choices that they make and accept the consequences.  In other words, blacks should stop blaming white folks for everything that goes wrong.<br />She then turns around and spends the first half or so of the book blaming whites for the state of black America.  She presents  horror stories of racism, such as the murder of Emmett Till, just as if she believes that they represent the state of race relations today.  Indeed, she expends much verbiage on whites and on how they pretend to support civil rights while secretly doing everything that they can to undermine those same civil rights.<br />Dickerson seems to have some racist tendencies of her own.  She seems  to resent the fact that Asian Americans  generally  live in mostly white, middle-class  communities as opposed to having their own ethnic enclaves.<br />Dickerson also has some weird ideas on how prevalent racism supposedly is in America. For instance,Dickerson complains about the fact that the movie &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; does not  include black soldiers storming the Normandy Beach. However,  she admits that no blacks participated in the D-Day invasion. Yet, she criticizes the producers for excluding a black presence in the film anyways.<br />After her carnival of criticism of whites and Asians for their alleged role in keeping blacks down, she then gets into the second half of her book, which is a critique of blacks in modern America.  In this part, she criticizes blacks for dwelling on the racist past and using racism as a crutch for blacks not making it in America.  By doing so, she completely contradicts the first half of her book.<br />This is an inconsistent and contradictory book on race relations in America.  Definitely not recommended.	2004-06-02

Contrary to what Easterbrook says, the economic state of middle America is not so rosy.  Jobs are this country's leading export.  Wages relative to inflation are stagnant at best for most folks who are not in white collar occupations.  Even for white collar workers, the economic climate is not so good.<br />Essentially, Easterbrook's book is a prosecutor's brief on the side of raising taxes.  He claims that even though most Americans are now better off than they ever have been, they are really miserable.  Easterbrook claims that what's needed is a big tax increase to fund the programs necessary to &quot;defeat global despair.&quot;<br />What Easterbrook has done, in essence, is to bend the facts to fit his predetermined agenda of advocating a big tax increase to fuel a big spending program.  More and more big government is what he's really interested in, not in healing the wounds of the middle class.	2004-06-01

It is also the one that does the best job of explaining just what Hiss's motives were.  According to White, Hiss had an incredible knack for manipulating people and took huge risks and literally thrived on living on the edge.  In other words, Hiss's espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union was motivated as much by the thrilling experience of being a spy as much as any ideological sympathies that he may have had for Communism.<br />This book is recommened reading for everyone with an interest in recent American history.	2004-06-01

Granted, it was an above average novel, but it had the potential to be much more.<br />The novel opens in Rome in 48 BC when the city is in tumult and the city government is hard pressed to maintain basic law and order.  There is an alleged prophetess who goes under the name of Cassandra and who like her Trojan namesake is widely believed to be able to forsee the future.  However, she is poisoned and detective Gordianus the Finder decides to try to figure out who's responsible for the dirty deed.<br />So far, so good.  However, the plot unravels from there.  Gordianus decides that the killer must have been one of the seven prominent women who went to Cassandra's funeral although it is not clear on what basis he makes that determination.  <br />One problem with mystery novels set in past historical times is that the detectives are invariably private citizens who do not have any legal power to compel folks to talk to them.  Nor do they have any sort of investigator's license to give them legitimacy.  So, the authors of these novels generally have the suspects answer just about every question put to them by the hero except the one that would establish who done it.  When a suspect refuses to answer a particular question, you know right then and there that this person is either guilty or a red herring.  <br />In the case of &quot;A Mist Of Prophecies,&quot; the reader can figure out who the villainess is early on in the book since the author, Steven Saylor, failed to establish a plausible red herring.  The guilty party in this novel just about did everything possible to make it easy for Gordianus to determine her guilt so much so that she might as well as gone around in public with a target painted on her back.<br />While the mystery part is weak, the historical part is the novel's strength.  The reader learns a lot about Roman history during this important time period in a way that holds the reader's interest.  Additionally, the novel is well written and has richly drawn characters.  <br />Overall, I give it 3 out of 5 stars, but it could have been so much better.	2004-05-31

This encyclopedia covers the years from the team's founding in 1900 through the 1996 season.  This book fills a need since few books of quality have been written about the White Sox over the years.<br />It includes short biographies of over 100 players in Sox history and biographies of all the managers, general managers and owners as well.  The encyclopedia also includes a year by year summary of all of the club's seasons.  And the best part is that it is loaded with all sorts of statistics that should settle just about every argument about Sox history and lore that you have had with fellow fans.  <br />One of the best things about this book is just how much better it is than the entry for the Chicago Cubs in the larger Temple University MLB Team History Series.  Hopefully, there are plans for a revised and expanded version of this excellent work.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-05-30
