A group of students were asked to make an evaluation of a group teachers, after being shown a 30 second clip; next, the clips were shorted to 10 seconds; and finally, too 2 seconds.  The results were roughly the same suggesting the immediate and direct impulse remain consistent despite duration and amount of information.  Interestingly, the same students were asked to evaluate the teachers after taking the course and the results were similar to the 2 second clip evaluations.<br /><br />Predicting divorce. A system of evaluation was devised to measure positive gestures against negative gestures using a numeric ranking system: defensiveness, inflexibility, hostileness, and anger.  The researcher analyzed short segments of interaction and rate it then compiled the results into a mathematical graph.  A trend line was next established.  The trend line suggests that once a pattern line converged downward, the results predictable were divorce, 94% of the time.  A micro glance immediately suggested divorce or long term relationship potential.<br /><br />Economics. A system of cards was devised where red cards caused loss and blue cards caused profit.  Participants discovered the profit loss pattern usually within 50 to 80 cards.

We assume valuable knowledge is in the hands of a few hands.  The truth is the experts are about 60 percent right.  For example, mutual fund experts, 95 percent of the time did not beat the stock market index.  One would have been better off just to invest their money in a S&P 500 index or the market valuations, as a whole.<br /><br />\\"Diversity and independance are important because the best collective decisions are the product of disagreement and contest, not consensus or compromise.  An intelligent group, especially when confronted with cognition problems, does not ask its member to modify their position in order to let the group reach a decision everyone can be happy with.\\"<br /><br />The fact that cognitive diversity matters does not mean that if you assemble a group of divese but thoroughly uninformed people, their collective wisdom will be smarter than the expert's.  Experts are needed too gain collective wisdom.  However, a group of only experts does not mean collective wisdom prevails: experts often consent, offer no new knowledge to the group, and exploit the existing knowledge.  Experts have a narrow speciality and produce a false assumption, they are experts in all areas of knowledge.<br /><br />Diversity brings new knowledge and perceptions to the table. The key to group intelligence is diversity. \\"And much of what we've seen so far suggest that a large group of diverse individuals will come up with a beter and more robust forecast and make more intelligent decisions than even the most skilled 'decision makers'\\"<br /><br />Independent information. Instead, it figures out how to use mechanisms - like market prices, or intelligent voting systems - to aggregate and produce collective judgments that represent not what any one person in the group thinks but rather, in some sense, what they all think. (Case in points given: Craven and the Scorpion, O-Ring failure of the space shuttle, Audience accuracy polls discovered by analyzing 'Who wants to be a millionare')<br /><br />Information cascade causes people to pay attention to the actions of others and imitate them.  Wisdoms comes as individuals chose too follow.  Error is discovered when results fail to keep the loyality of the following (Case Wood plank road).<br /><br />\\"The fundamental problem with information cascade is that after a certain point it becomes rational for people to stop paying attention to own knowledge - their private information - and to start looking instead at the acitons of others and imitate them.\\"  The cascade become a sequence of uninformed decisions, so collectively the group begins to make bad decisions, the trend stops.  In information cascade, people decisions are not made independantly, but are profoundly influenced - in some cases, even determined by those around them.  Information cascade is kept going by people valuing public information more highly than their private information.<br /><br />Encouraging people to make incorrect guesses actually makes the collective group smarter.  Why? Peoples private information is imperfect and incomplete.  So paying attention to ones own information will make the guess wrong.  But it is the group's collective accuracy that counts and when this truth is follow people will listen to their private information.  For this reason organizations, clearly should have people offer their judgments simulateously, rather than one after another.<br /><br />Wisdom of the crowds supports decentralization as a given good. \\"Decentralizations great strength is that it encourages independance and specialization on the one hand while still allowing people to coordinate their activities and solve difficult problems on the other.  Decentralization great weakness is that there's no guarantee that valuable information which is uncovered in one part of the system will find its way through the rest of the system.\\"<br /><br />\\"A decentralized system can only produce genuinely intelligent results if there is a means of aggregating the information of everyone in the system.\\"<br /><br />Coordination. 1958, Thomas C Schelling suggest that in many situations, there were salient landmarks or \\"focal points\\" upon which peoples expectations converge.  Schellings findings are important because it shows that people can find their way to collectively beneficial results without a centralized direction and without talking with each other.  Schelling points suggest that peoples experiences of the world are often surprisingly similar, which make coordination easier.e other.

ZettaCore is developing nanoscale organic molecules to function as memory.  HP is working to develop an Atomic Resolution Storage product that can encode one bit per atom.  If successful, ARS would allow for storage of material at one hundred million times the density of the current disk technology.  Applied Nanotech is introducing a nanotube display which will change flat screen display. In their first demo they demonstrated a 14 in nanotube display which will be cheaper, better, and thinner than existing technology.  Nanophase technologies producing nanoparticles that are being used in vinyl floors and the floors are harder, more resistent to scratching and chipping, and maintain their gloss.  Nanomuscle is producing micro sized devices that are created from nanocrytals taht can change shape whien applied with electric current.  Nanomuscle has been delivering to Hasbro too be used in new toy product lines.  The Navy is employing nanoparticle technology to coat turbines and engine parts increasing performance and efficiency.  Likewise, the Navy has been using Nanoparticles to create corrosion resistent protection helping Navy ships reduce drag, increase speed, decrease rust, and making the surfaces harder and more resistent to barnacles and tubeworms.  The application of nanoparticles has produced a 10% increase in efficiency.  Nippon Corp uses Titanium dioxide nanoparticles to coat mirrors, create stain resistent automobile paints, and sterile hospital rooms.  Titanium dioxide is a photocatylst when combined with light will burn off dangereous bacteria.  Photocatalystically reactions can use sunlight to loosen dirt and smudges from material producing self cleaning light and appliances.  Nano-Tex is creating nanomaterials that resist stains helping Lee Jeans and Eddie Bauer to market stain resistent jeans.  Nanotechnology is creating nanoclay and nanocomposites for use in every day plastic.  Plastic has the advantage of being flexible, moldable, and cheap.  The nanocomposites are combined to produce super strong plastics and increasing their melting point and facture point.  In 2004 and 2005 Nanotechnology created products that were better, smaller, cheaper, and better.  Nanosphere introduced a viral detection system capable of sounding an alarm against airborn substances, such as, anthrax and smallpox with ten times faster response and 100,000 times increase in accuracy.  C-Sixty is researching a nanoscopic device which when injected in the body can precisely fit in the pocket of an AIDS virus and disrupt the virus ability to reproduce.  Angstrom is developing nanocrystals that can be mixed with the bodies cells to help regrow bones, a promising treatment for osteoporosis which affects 28 million Americans cost Health care $15 billion.  Fuel Cell storage and separation of hydrogen will use nanotechnology.  Nano particle catlyst will be used instead of graphite fibers to split the hydrogen into protons and electrons.  Also, nanotechnology will be used to storage the hydrogen and reduce the rate of hydrogen escape from its container.  Fuel cells offer the promise of providing electricity for transportation and power to businesses and homes.<br /><br />What does the future hold?  Nanobots running specific algorithms similar to biological celluar algorithms.  The nanobots use raw material molecules, prode, manipulate, and assemble the molecule into a material composition.  The material composition are assembled into a geometric shape.  For example a mound of copper could be assembled into a door knob, for macro assembly.  The end result could be a home created from molecules that nanobots assemble to build a more complex structure.<br /><br />Nano technology will disrupt how medicene is delivered to patients.  In the future, nanotechnology will come in the form of a patch.  The patch will be applied to the skin of the patient, small nanomachines will release specific drugs into the blood of the patient, as needed.  The patches will be computer assembled and disseminated.<br /><br />Nano technology will be used too simulate celluar functionality. These nanobots will be used able to fix celluar damage, prevent disease, destroy cancer or defective cells, or provide barriers between host and foreign cells.  For example, pig islets cells contained within a protective nanocell allow glucose into the cell, produce insulin which is small enough to pass outside the cell, and block incoming antibodies that cell the pig islet cells.

Focus is the key.  One could spend their whole life reflecting and pondering about the atonement and its power to save.<br /><br />The infinite atonement includes an understanding of Christ's suffering, Christ's power over death and sin, Christ love for us, and the possiblity of exaltation.  The atonement makes weakness and infirmity bearable because Jesus descendant below all things, overcame all things, and trumphets as Lord of Lord and King of Kings.<br /><br />I found Callister discussion of the atonement scripturally comprehensive and his sources for doctrinal support familar and solid.  Callister instructs the reader to study the atonement and warns against the adversary distractions that remove a person from focusing on the mercy and beauty of the atonement.  All doctrines can be measure in terms of relevancy and save capacity by relating the doctrines to the atonement.<br /><br />I have seen the atonement and testify it is more than a concept.  The atonement is the most beautiful and merciful experience in my life and I would not worry about all the scriptural argument relating to the atonement, when you seen the atonement in action, one's life changes because it is glorious and powerful and it transcends the critical mind, it is mercy and compassion.  We are the sheep and the Lord is the good sheppard and seek to hear the words of the the good Sheppard by seeing with ones spiritual eyes and listening too the still small voice and feeling with the heart.  The atonement will change ones life, if one will seek to understand and become obedient to God's laws.<br /><br />Callister seemingly expresses many of the emotions associated with the grace of Christ.  Callister highlights numerous church leader thoughts relating to the grace of Christ.  We learn that Jesus has compassion on the descendants of Adam and is merciful to the children of men.  We learn that the suffering in garden of getheseme pressed the Lord with the weight of sin and infirmity until great drops of blood flow from every pore. Everything in the garden bore testimony of the atonement, the symbolism, and the sacrifice of the only begotten.<br /><br />Christ demonstrated obedience to the will of the father and kept his premortal pledge too be a savior.  Jesus is real, he is not a concept, a story, or a myth.  Through the atonement, Jesus knows how to succor us in our infirmities.  Justice extended credit to the Messiah and many penitent were reconcilled and received forgiveness and eternal life, prior to the garden of getheseme.  The atonement bridges the separation between man and God and provides a way home.  As in the story of the one leoper out of ten, who returned and worship Jesus, we learn that Jesus connects us to our heavanly home.<br /><br />Jesus alone suffered the sins of the world. The father's spirit withdrew as the sins pressed against the Savior, Jesus cried out, \\"Father why hasth thou forsaketh me?\\".  Three times, Jesus requested comfort and support from his disciples and did not receive comfort.  The atonement was carried by the Messiah, alone.  Jesus suffered the atonement because he loved us, \\"Greater love hath this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\\"  The great Jehovah completed the will of the Father, defeated Lucifer's evil forces and hordes, and provided everlasting hoping.  The atonement grant every man the opportunity too be resurrected, learn between good and evil, and prevail over evil.<br /><br />The infinite atonement covers the fall of man, redemption through Christ and the saving ordinances, and glory and exaltation.eseme pressed the Lord with the weight of sin and infirmity until great drops of blood flow from every pore.

US	52769921	R1MIU924VQJI9M	038551316X	86124043	The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ	Books	5	36	53	N	N	A witness and a Warning	Do not deny the writings of the Book of Mormon.<br />2 Nephi 33:11,14<br />11. And if they are not the words of Christ, judge ye-for Christ will show unto you, with power and great glory, that they are his words, at the last day; and you and I shall stand face to face before his bar; and ye shall know that I have been commanded of him to write these things, notwithstanding my witness.<br />14.And you that will not part of the goodness of God, and respect the words of the Jews, and also my words, and the words which shall proceed forth out of the mouth of the Lamb of God, behold, I bid you an everlasting farewell, for these words shall condemn you at the last day.<br />Jesus Christ will prove the Book of Mormon words are true with great power and glory at the last days. Jesus Christ will be our judge and He will judge all mankind. Jesus Christ admonishes the righteous saint to continue in righteousness, be faithful, and endure to the end. Jesus Christ convincingly warns the wicked to repent, stop hating Him, cease from rebellion, and seek admission into the Kingdom of God. The contest is between the unbelievers and the Lord; the Lord says He will prove the words of the Book of Mormon are true with great power and glory; the unbeliever will be without defense, as the power and glory of the Lord is manifest: the innocent will be vindicated, the saints will be quickened, and the wicked destroyed with fire.<br />Moroni 10:27<br />27. And I exhort you to remember these things; for the time speedily cometh that  ye shall know that I lie not, for ye shall see me at the bar of God; and the Lord God will say unto you: Did I not declare my words unto you, which were written by this man, like as one crying from the dead, yea, even as one speaking out of the dust.<br />Moroni also testifies that he will be a witness at Judgment that the Word of Christ written in the Book of Mormon is true. The punishment of the law demands that Justice is not robbed. Moroni teaches that those who die in their sins will not escape justice through the mercy of Jesus Christ. Instead, the word and law of Christ as described in the Book of Mormon will bear testimony against their sins and justice will claim the creature.  Thus these words are a sharp rebuke for the wicked to repent and avoid the awful monster of justice. Ignorance is not a defense against the claims of breaking the law. Today is a day of probation, a time to prepare to meet God, a time to repent. Failure to read and study the Book of Mormon is no justification to escape the laws binding to the inhabitants of this earth. Therefore, both member and nonmember are under condemnation and if they do not study and apply the teachings of the Book of Mormon.<br />2 Nephi 28:29<br />29.Wo be unto him that shall say: We have received the word of God, and we need no more of the word of God, fore we have enough.<br />Whenever, the Lord uses the word, \\"wo\\", he indicates a sharp warning; a warning so severe that if this is ignored the wrath of God and calamities of the wicked are sure to follow.<br />2 Nephi 29:3-11 \\"A Bible, we have got a Bible, and we need no more Bible\\".<br />The Lord teaches that in the mouth of two or more witnesses the truth is established God does not favor one nation over another; he is no respecter of person. The canon of scriptural writings will prove that God is the same yesterday, today, and tommorow, unalterable and unchangeable.<br />Ether 12:23-27 \\"Lord, the Gentiles will mock at these things, because of our weakness in writing, for Lord thou has made us mighty in word by faith\\", \\"I fear the gentiles will mock us at our words\\" 26. And when I had said this, the Lord spake unto me saying, Fools mock, but they shall mourn; and my grace is sufficient for the meek, that shall take no advantage of your weakness;<br />The wisdom of the wise shall perish; the learned, who hearken not to the Lord will fall; and the meek shall inherit the earth. I believe in the prophecy that the meek inheriting the earth also suggests they will receive their celestial inheritance. Interestingly, the meek will be blessed with the grace of God, to understand the words of the Book of Mormon.<br />Mormon 8:16-17<br />16. \\"And blessed be he that shall bring this thing to light; for it shall be brought out of darkness unto light, according to the word of God; yea, it shall be brought out of the earth, and it shall shine forth out of darkness, and come unto the knowledge of the people; and it shall be done by the power of God.\\"<br />17. \\"He that condemneth, let him be aware lest he shall be in danger of hell fire.\\"<br />The Book of Mormon is not to be condemned. Those who choose to condemn the Book of Mormon rashly tempt God, or smiteth the righteous bring Judgment against themselves.<br />Oppose and resist secret combinations.<br />Ether 8:18-26. \\"Murder for gain is abominable to the Lord\\". Mormon 8:26-41.<br /><br />The cries of the slain saints will cry up for Justice and the Lord will be unable to turn a deaf earth to their cries. The wrath of God will sweep the wicked from the earth.  We are to hope that there is sufficient time for the wicked to repent before the great and dreadful day of the Lord. Time is mercy because it give the wicked an opportunity to see the error of their ways, the lack of fruit in the lies they believe, and the craftiness and deceptions of man. The wild branches needs time to be grafted into the tame fruit of the tree and start producing good fruit.<br /><br />The Book of Mormon is a type of our Day.  Murder for gain or theft is the driving force behind war.  Scarcity is the product of war and not the forces of free market systems.  Righteous moral belief systems abhor war and consider its methods and affects, evil.  I do not believe Jesus delights in the conflicts and wars of men.  I do not believe that in the last century man has been justified in the cause of war.  I say where is the reveal justification that the Lord is command man to fight and kill?  Men fight because they have forgotten the teachings of Jesus.  Listen to the anquish of Momon:<br /><br />Mormon 6: 17-22<br />17. O ye fair ones, how could ye have departed from the ways of the Lord!  O ye fair ones, how could ye have rejected that Jesus, who stood with open arms to receive you!<br /><br />18. Behold, if ye have done this, ye would have not fallen.  But hehold, ye are fallen, and I mourn your loss.<br /><br />19. O ye fair sons and daughters, ye fathers and mothers, ye husbands and wives, ye fair ones, how is it that ye could have fallen!<br /><br />20. But hehold, ye are gone, and my sorrows cannot bring your return<br /><br />21. And the day cometh that your mortal must put on immortality, and these bodies which are now moldering in corruption must soon become incorruptible bodies; and then ye must stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, to be judged according to your works; and if it so be that ye are righteous, then are ye blessed with your fathers who have gone before you.<br /><br />22.  O that ye had repented before this great destruction had come upon you.  But behold ye are gone and the Father yea the Eternal Father of heaven knoweth your state; and he doeth with you according to his justice and mercy.<br />Pride leads to the fall of civilizations.<br />Moroni 8:27 Pride destroyed the Nephites.<br />2 Nephi 28:15-16 The proud are puffed up, they teach false doctrines, commit whoredoms, and pervert the right way of the Lord. The proud are full of iniquity and ripe for destruction. The rotten fruit analogy versuses the beautiful fruit analogy should be a point of focus. The righteous have radiant countenances, bright and illuminated like the crystal lights of a beautiful light. The righteous radiate with happiness, contentment, and intelligence and they are a delight to behold. The fruit of the tree can be directly witnesses by the countenances of the righteous saint. There inner light is so transparent that all can see andglorify our father, in heaven.  In contrast the rotten fruit demonstrates a countenance of anger, pride, arrogance, and decept.  A rotten fruit can not bring forth good fruit.<br />Alma 32:14 Blessed are those that are not compelled to be humble.<br />Pride leads to the fall because a untrue hypothesis is undefeatable and irrational.  The mind can not grasp and sustain a lie indefinitely.  The pain associated with embracing a lie will eventually cause the individual too abandon the lie.  Interestingly,  as the group discovers and abandons the lie often in force.  As true is revealed, a stronger and more compelling force substitutes and dissolves the lie.  The power of the true is so tremendous that complete systems based on pride will dissolve instantaneously.  The either means the system repented and turned from their error or they were destroyed.  Now, Jesus Christ understands our case and has pleads for us.  If we will discover the truth, we will find that Jesus has been careful orchestrating events designed to assist in our success, all along.  Destruction only occurs when the fruit is rotten and the devil has seal these servants as his own.  At that point, there is not use in trying to redeem the bad fruit.  The fruit is only salvageable in the early stages of sin.<br />The Lord warns against the curse of unbelief.<br />Mormon 9:7-10 The Lord speaks against those who deny the revelations of God telling them if they willfully deny revelations, prophecies, gifts, healing, speaking in tongues, and interpretation of tongues, then they must think God is a changeable God. Furthermore, these individuals must think God is not a God of miracles. Therefore, they deny that the power of God exists.<br />Mormon 9: 15-21 \\"Miracles cease because of unbelief\\"<br />Moroni 7:37-38 \\"It is by faith that miracles are wrought\\". Men have faith in Jesus Christ because of their meekness; if we do not have faith in Jesus Christ then we are not fit for membership in his church. Moroni 10:24-34 \\"If the day comes that the power and gifts of God are done away with\\" it will because of unbelief and those that do good possess the gift and power of God to act.<br />30. And again I would exhort you that ye would come unto Christ, and lay hold upon every good gift, and touch not the evil gift, nor the unclean thing.<br />31. And awake, and arrive from the dust, O Jerusalem; yea, and put on thy beautiful garments, O daughter of Zion; and strengthen thy stakes and enlarge thy borders forever.<br />The priesthood is the power and glory of God manifest through the actions of worthy priesthood holders.  The glory of God is intelligence.  Priesthood holders are too act and not be acted upon.  A good measure of faith is required too act.  A priesthood holder should \\"Invoke\\" the powers of heaven rather than passively request assistance.  The priests of Levi exercised great faith by stepping into the waters of the Jordon before the river parted and they crossed over dry ground.  Faith must proceed the miracle.<br />Mormon 9:2,5 (To the unbeliever) 2. Behold, will ye believe in the day of your visitation-behold, when the Lord shall come, yea, even that great day when the earth shall be rolled together as a scroll, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, yea, in the great day when ye shall be brought to stand before the Lamb of God-then will ye say there is not God?<br />5.

We will be judged out of the books given to us by God, including the words of the Book of Mormon.<br /><br />See<br />2 Ne 26:16-23; 2 Ne 27-30; Morm 6:16-22; Morm 8:26-41; Morm 9:1-6; Morm 9:7-10,15-19,27-31,35; Moro 8:9-24; Moro 9:8-24; Moro 10:24-34; 2 Ne 33:10-15; Eth 8:18-26; Moro 8:27; D&C 20:9, 38-39; 3 Ne 25:1; Morm 5:22-24; Hel 12; He 6:17; Eth 2:9-11; 2 Ne 1:20; Hel 13:12-14; 3 Ne 9:11rotten fruit can not bring forth good fruit.  Alma 32:14 Blessed are those that are not compelled to be humble.   Pride leads to the fall because a untrue hypothesis is undefeatable and irrational.   The mind can not grasp and sustain a lie indefinitely.   The pain associated with embracing a lie will eventually cause the individual too abandon the lie.    Interestingly,  as the group discovers and abandons the lie often in force.   As true is revealed, a stronger and more compelling force substitutes and dissolves the lie.  The power of the true is so tremendous that complete systems based on pride will dissolve instantaneously.   The either means the system repented and turned from their error or they were destroyed.   Now, Jesus Christ understands our case and has pleads for us.   If we will discover the truth, we will find that Jesus has been careful orchestrating events designed to assist in our success, all along.   Destruction only occurs when the fruit is rotten and the devil has seal these servants as his own.   At that point, there is not use in trying to redeem the bad fruit.   The fruit is only salvageable in the early stages of sin.  The Lord warns against the curse of unbelief.  Mormon 9:7-10 The Lord speaks against those who deny the revelations of God telling them if they willfully deny revelations, prophecies, gifts, healing, speaking in tongues, and interpretation of tongues, then they must think God is a changeable God. Furthermore, these individuals must think God is not a God of miracles. Therefore, they deny that the power of God exists.   Mormon 9: 15-21 \\"Miracles cease because of unbelief\\"   Moroni 7:37-38 \\"It is by faith that miracles are wrought\\". Men have faith in Jesus Christ because of their meekness; if we do not have faith in Jesus Christ then we are not fit for membership in his church. Moroni 10:24-34 \\"If the day comes that the power and gifts of God are done away with\\" it will because of unbelief and those that do good possess thegift and power of God to act.   30. And again I would exhort you that ye would come unto Christ, and lay hold upon every good gift, and touch not the evil gift, nor the unclean thing.   31. And awake, and arrive from the dust, O Jerusalem; yea, and put on thy beautiful garments, O daughter of Zion; and strengthen thy stakes and enlarge thy borders forever.   The priesthood is the power and glory of God manifest through the actions of worthy priesthood holders.   The glory of God is intelligence.  Priesthood holders are too act and not be acted upon.   A good measure of faith is required too act.   A priesthood holder should \\"Invoke\\" the powers of heaven rather than passively request assistance.   The priests of Levi exercised great faith by stepping into the waters of the Jordon before the river parted and they crossed over dry ground.   Faith must proceed the miracle.  Mormon 9:2,5 (To the unbeliever) 2. Behold, will ye believe in the day of your visitation-behold, when the Lord shall come, yea, even that great day when the earth shall be rolled together as a scroll, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, yea, in the great day when ye shall be brought to stand before the Lamb of God-then will ye say there is not God?   5.

Feynman	Books	5	2	2	N	N	The great chess game of physics	Science is discoverying the rules to the great chess game of the physical world.  If the rules do not work in all situations, one must assume there are new rules and this means accepting the reality that there are new rules.  We can not assume to control science or think to limit the rules because confined understanding of the rules.  The rules can be very complex.  Some rules are very predictable, such as the rules outside the atom; however, rules about the interior of the atom are largely unknown.<br /><br />At best we can approximate what science is.  We must simply observe and try to understand the physical rules.  Feynman tells us, to learn from experience and experimentation.  A scientist must have a curious mind, a scientist is a curious discover.  Doubt is good.  Doubt makes the scientist question, these questions lead to experimentation, observation of pattern, and arrangement of models to explain the observations.  Feynman doubts that further scientist will be able to contribute because of their intuitive powers, as in the case of Faraday, whose theories of the atom proved true long before the mathematical models verified the perceptions.  Feynman says, that scientist will need to know the mathematics techniques and concepts of the past and then incrementally build on these ideas.  Feynman says students are getting smarter, in the early 70s, QED was thought to be too complicated for undergraduate students and currently the University teaches the class to undergraduates.<br /><br />The experiment proves the truth.  Science and mathematics is about pattern recognition and memory recall.  Feynman explains physics in the first person, explaining what it would be like in an atom, what a person would see, if they could see quarks and quark streams.  I particular enjoyed how Feynman explains how his father taught him physics.  His father explained inertia by demonstrating to young Feynman that the ball does not move against the back of the wagon but the wagon moves against the ball.  Feynman became very skilled at visualizing pattern.  In one weaving class, Feynman was recognized by the teacher for his skill at predicting a weaving pattern before it was wove and then creating the complex series of patterns.<br /><br />Feynman observed that woman can be taught advanced mathematics.  Once while sitting in a cafeteria, he overheard two girls taking about knitting.  Feynman thought they were talking about geometry and when he discovered they were talking about knitting realized teaching mathematics to different brains was possible but that the approach may need to be different. Feynman does not like to teach equations and assemble of equations for students to get passing grades.  Instead, Feynman likes to provoke students to think, disprove, and fight to discover what the equations mean.  Feynman is a masterful sparing mentor, many students acheive understanding, and these are the student he wants to teach.gon moves against the ball.

Bogle on Great Ideas in Financing includes four criteria: 1. Simplicity - Buy the whole market haystack, an index capable of matching the market. 2. Focus (Seek the hard crusted but nutritious bagel of earnings, dividends, and interest yields rather than the sweet donut taste of price with its high price earning multiples) 3. Efficiency (minimize frictional costs of fees, commissions, and taxes with an Wilshire 5000 index).  4. Stewardship (keep the interest of the client first).  Bogle's index was free of tax, include a small transactional fee, represented 8000 stocks in the market, and matched the market rate of return.<br /><br />Mutual funds have become a vehicle for short-term speculation, a trend fostered in part by the industries focus on marketing.  Today the average fund holds stock for 400 days compared to six years when Bogle graduated from Princeton.  Most investors hold their mutual fund for 3 years rather than 15 years.  Since 1980 - 2000 mutual fund assets have risen 70 fold from $100 billion to $6.5 trillion and assets of stock funds have risen 120 fold or $4.0 trillion.  In a 15-year span there were 426 mutual fund boats and 113 sunken mutual fund boats.  Survival was strong because of the generous returns of the market.  However, Mutual fund efficiency was problem: 1. Sales tax, excessive fees, spending too much on marketing, failing to share economy of scale with the investors, and 90% turn over of the portfolio each year suggested one thing, \\"short term speculation\\" was becoming the norm.  Mutual fund sites charge costs included a front-end sales commission of 6%; opportunity cost meaning held cash positions equal to 7% of assets with these asset earning smaller returns than available in stocks; a transactional cost of 1.7%; and operating cost equal to 1.2% per year.<br /><br />Bogle's outlook of the stock market is brilliant.  Bogle states: financial economist cannot predict the future.  The DOW may hit 36,000 and it may not.  Who can predict accurately what the market will do?  The market is not a machine.  The market is not an insurance actuaries spreadsheet.  However, the market performed remarkable well with price gaining 17% a year and at this rate doubling every four years.  To understand the market lets look first too dividend yield and earnings growth because these elements provide the steady underlying force over the long pull.  For two decades dividend yield equaled 4.5% and earning growth paced at 5.9% producing a 10.9% return.  In 1970, P/E fell 50% from 16 times to 7.3 and dividend yield equaled 3.4% and annual earnings equaled 9.9% producing a 10.4% investment return and Bogle preached \\"stay the course\\".  By 2000, dividends equaled 1%, earning growth rate reached 8%, and P/E ratios top 30.  Again, Bogle preached, \\"time, risk, and control\\" raising a cautious outlook and a cry for investors to return back to investor basics of earnings, dividends, and yields.<br /><br />What were the factors associated with the 87 crash? 1. Stock prices were simply to high to the underlying earnings and dividends in comparison to higher yields available on fixed income securities. 2. Deterioration in economic outlook with no progress to reduce the federal deficit, no improvements in the trade imbalance, and inflation in the air.  3. Program trading in the futures market sparked massive computer driven sales.  The impact being 35% of the equity traded out of the market.  In 87, if you're a Contrarian, it is a good time to buy or hold.<br /><br />Thinking about 2000, Bogle observed for growth to remain constant over the next ten years, the P/E ratio would need to move from 30 to 67 an unlikely possibility.  If in 2000, the P/E ratio fell too 12 then the market level would be 580 rather than 1400 with a P/E of 30. If the P/E fell from 30 to 20 then market return would drop to 5.5% less than the percentage rate of high yield bonds and such an event would be the first in stock history.  Is the market comfort zone, a P/E of 15.5 and this fact suggests the market has moved to a level of high risk and possible correction?  Bogle states, \\"Looking back 70 years, major market highs were almost invariably signaled when the dividends yield on stocks fell below 3%, or price earnings rose much about 20 times earnings\\".  The purpose of any stock investment is cash now with the expectation of future flows of cash.  A high P/E ratio means investors are expecting a large flow of future cash.  The high prices are based on speculation about the cash flow in the future.  If the future cash flow expectations are not rational does this mean short-term profit taking is picking clean the amateur investor?<br /><br />Bogle was left to reflect on two questions: 1. Will the bagel of investment fundamentals give us its usual sustenance? 2. And will the doughnut of speculation get even sweeter than it is today, or will it finally sour?  Bogle concluded, \\"We are in a new era of investing\\".<br /><br />Warren Buffet said, \\"The art of investing in public companies is ... simply to acquire, at a sensible price a business with excellent economies and able, honest management.  Thereafter, you need only monitor whether these qualities are being preserved.\\"<br /><br />Bogle suggests two principles when dealing with risk 1. Get your asset allocation right, maintaining a long-term horizon, and stay the course.  Bogle observed that the long term real return on stock is 7.5%.  Assuming one has a million dollars that is $75,000 annual income.  2. Diversity some of the risk away by introducing equities with reliable different correlations with the U.S market.  Maybe, we will see the creation of a worldwide index, 60/40 - 60 percent U.S stock and 40 percent other?  Bogle stresses investors not too speculate, however, life is short and if one needs too speculate they should limit the amount too 5 percent in the gamble for higher profits.  Bogle's is betting on the performance of the whole market index rather than one sector mutual fund.  Bogle is saying the market price is too high and a risk at its current levels.  Bogle thinks mutual funds should be able to buy bonds and other stable securities as a part of the mutual fund mix.<br /><br />Thinking about bonds, bond yields drop as the economy moves to a recession because investor flee from stocks into bonds and since money is easy to acquire the rates drop.  In this scenerio, short term traders buy bonds now with the anticipation the yields will drop more in the future and investor will pay more for these bonds with a higher yield.  Again, a short-term speculation to capture a quick profit.  However, if haystack of stocks continues producing 7.5% real returns then stay the course.of high yield bonds and such an event would be the first in stock history.

US	52769921	R2B340AFT8SEVA	0805058745	749684877	When Things Start to Think	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Smart devices should keep context information used by the device to provide helpful reactions	Dr Gershenfeld,the director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Centre for Bits and Atoms believes the next digital revolution will be a personal-fabrication machine costing about $20k. The personal-fabrication machine is made possible through open software, wireless communication, and internet collaboration technology.<br /><br />Gershenfeld like Bill Gates recognizes the potential in connecting the computer to the customer. Gates recognized the power of programmable languages; data presentation through a multitasking, preemptive context switching, and windows interface OS; and aggressive marketing of the microsoft products. Gershenfeld realizes the power of giving the most complex and sophisticated hardware and software to scientist and engineers of poor and remote countries giving them the power to fabricate tools and machines. Gershenfeld approach makes the digital virtual bits become concrete natural material bits. This is not about charity, this is about reducing the cost of production and increasing the quality of the product in cost prohibitive areas of the world. More directly it could mean a change in how consumers acquire the products they need. These tools and machines are cool because they solve simple problems where access to manufactured goods and services are not possible because of cost.<br /><br />Gates received strong support from the engineering and software development community and they rallied too build hundreds of millions of dollars worth of VBX/OCX components. Gershenfeld will need strong support from the community of programmers, scientist, and engineers too build a rich public library of tool/machine/chip schematics available by internet search and all downloadable digitally into the fabrication lab; also, complex scientific theory will need to be delivered, as intuitive concepts for search and application; and engineers and computer scientist will need to write software applications making the Computer Aid Design intuitive and functional.<br /><br />Manufacturing is about process oriented series steps in a complex series of systematic events. Gershenfeld knows that the complexity is massive and reducing this complexity to a simple lab is the first step to bringing engineering and science to the consumer.<br /><br />However, Gershenfeld freely admits that scientist experts, computer experts, and engineering experts will need to be access through the Fab Lab communities. The idea that imperfect components with error correction can build a perfect system is the fundamental law. Machines that can provide a little maintenance can last forever and produce indefinitely, things that become smarter.<br /><br />The personal-fabrication machine will allow individuals and small businesses to customise products meeting their needs and releasing an outpouring of talent. The segmentation between structural design and functionality are bridged by personal-fabrication. Structural engineers can build prototypes and include microchips to provide functionality. Eventually, these microchips will be small wirelessly computers with the ability to provide feedback, make decisions, and start other processes. Personal-fabrication becomes more feasible as the size of the computer reduces and the cost drops and the computer becomes more functional and more closely integrated into all facets of existence.<br /><br />Gernshenfeld poses a thought provoking idea that smart devices should keep context information and this context information should be used by the device to provide helpful reactions. In the case of the product theft device, a small frequency transmits a certain frequency within a magnetic field, a siren goes off, and staff attention is attracted. The amazing fact is that the device cost about one penny. Gernshenfeld explains that the goal is to get more functionality for less money. In the case of the Fab Lab, micro chips cost about 50 to 70 cents. I believe things of demand always become cheapers, so the goal will be getting desired functionality on these chips fast and easy and that takes brains!<br /><br />Fab lab&#34; version 1.0 includes a laser cutter capable of making two and three dimensional structures, a device that uses a computer-controlled knife to carve, a miniature milling machine, software for programming cheap computer chips known as microcontrollers, and a jigsaw.<br /><br />The &#34;Fab lab&#34; is capable of precision of a millionth of a meter. The purpose is to provide inventors in poor countries with the best technology to solve their problems. Fab Lab provides an scaled down manufacturing fabrication model allowing device creation that is both functional and structural suitable for the need. The end result is a working prototype capable of solving a particular problem. Fab labs have been used to produce jewllery, car parts, agricultural tools, communication equipment, solar power devices, radio collars, wireless networks. The &#34;Fab Lab&#34; makes printing semiconductors, transistors, and other electronic devices as if they were made of paper. Fab Lab will produce things and these things will be smart. Reuse will of things will be a big issue.<br /><br />Hits=0 Hey, how cool would it be too walk into Radio Shack, ask for a demo of the Fab Lab, and build a machine? Remember when the TRS-80 when cost 5k? The concept was cool and now everyone has a computer a million times more powerful.<br /><br />Many companies will ask is it practical to purchase the &#34;Fab Lab&#34; with the proliferation of components that can be ordered by internet or catalogue. I think the Fab Lab will gain in strength as it continues to bridge the gap between form and function. As structural and functional pattern package and standardized by groups these packages will be replicated and the Fab Lab will be the technology for replication. The Fab Lab must build the infrasture to become the bridge between the virtual digital world and the concrete world. The advantages of pure digital storage of pattern is staggering: just in time inventories, richer possiblities for solutions, stronger collaboration between ideas, and open design communities to sponser innovation.e goal will be getting desired functionality on these chips fast and easy and that takes brains!<br /><br />Fab lab&#34; version 1.0 includes a laser cutter capable of making two and three dimensional structures, a device that uses a computer-controlled knife to carve, a miniature milling machine, software for programming cheap computer chips known as microcontrollers, and a jigsaw.<br /><br />The &#34;Fab lab&#34; is capable of precision of a millionth of a meter.

US	52769921	R29NZRGBHHJP7Y	0471412791	437056771	The Biotech Investor's Bible	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Biotech is a small market niche with strong growth potential	Biotech investors may be able too realize profits by recognizing the Biotech sector is an industry that will take several decades to mature.  Biotech has taken two decades of research for the first wave of products to start hitting the market.  In 2000, biotech had 30,000 patients submitted more than all the years combined of 16,000 patients total.  Individual investors have the opportunity to own some of tomorrow's giants, if they take a position early and wait as the market gyrates and finally recognizes a great emerging giant.<br /><br />Biotech is a small market niche and the growth potential is strong and investors provide the capital for growth and expansion in this sector.  Investors have shifted investment strategies away from research information collection investment too product oriented investment.  One expert estimates the cost to bring a drug to market at $1.5 billion and 15 years of research and development effort.<br /><br />The author segments the Biotech sector into four tiers: Tier 1 - biotech companies generating a substantial revenue flow and usually having high PE ratios suggesting high investor expectations for results and offer greater reliability because of their revenue flow: Amgen created Epogen, a drug that cause blood regeneration yielding profits of over a billion dollars a year and Biogen created three interferon drugs for (Hepatitis C, Cancer and MS); Tier 2 - biotech companies representing a long term growth investment.  These types of biotech companies have strong developed research capabilities, a strong drug pipeline, a good array of partners and alliances, royalty revenue, and greater prospects than Tier 1; Tier 3- biotech companies with a promising product line, market capitalization greater than $800 million, in danger of severe loss on product failure or FDA rejection, position for great gains if FDA approved, and represent the major of investment opportunity; Tier 4 - biotech companies that are inexpensive to position in, these are the great bargains and they are characterized as having market capitalization below $800 millions with low trade volume and risks of liquidity shortages.<br /><br />Tier 2 companies are attractive because they have products on the market and these products usually take one to two years to realize a gain.  Biotech survival depends on having getting more drugs to the trial stage, thus, increasing the likelihood of a profit.  Second creating drugs or therapies focused on treating serious or untreatable diseases.  Third arranging alliances and partnerships too reduce risk and provide market and development capital.  And fourth shorten times for FDA approval.<br /><br />The author recommends keeping an eye out for simple and inexpensive ways to combat disease.  The author warns that biotech is very volatile characterized often with swings reaching between 10 to 30 percent in a day, furthermore, hedges against the risk of loss where gains could be 20-30 percent if FDA approved and 70 percent if reject.  The market will not tolerate failure and has punished numerous companies when a product has an adverse effect on a consumer.<br /><br />The author also points out that often the market will react positively on news driving the price up but sell off in the following months but often the long term pattern demonstrates a positive price acceleration.

A new bull commodity market is emerging. The twentieth century saw three long commodities bulls (1906-1923, 1933-1953, and 1968-1982), each lasting an average of 17 years. Price is a function of supply-and-demand, as supplies are plentiful prices remain low; as supplies become scarce prices will rise. An investor, who realizes when a supply and demand imbalance is occurring and invests, will make money.<br /><br />Good investment is looking for opportunities and buying cheap then holding long term for significant profits. Stocks are over priced with excessively high P/E ratios. Can stocks continue to soar higher? When commodity prices go up stock prices go down, the cost of doing business. Bonds yields are weak as lower interest rates have drove down yields. Real Estate is an investment bubble waiting to be burst with a possible resulting loss of wealth ranging between $2 to $3 trillion. Prices are too high for investors to make money. Currencies values are a function of national debt. The U.S is the largest debtor with $8 trillion dollars of international IOUs. For the last 20 years, the U.S has been borrowing in world financial markets because of large trade deficits and the continual borrowing has drove down the value of the dollar. Increase government spending and the Feds printing of money have created a devalued dollar and reduced foreign investment; in a 12 month period between June 2003 and June 2004 foreign investment went a negative $155 billion). The weaker dollar makes commodities seem more expensive, as in the case of oil; between 2002 and 2004 crude oil prices rose 64 percent in dollar and 16 percent in euros with the dollar losing 40 percent against the euro in the same time period. The strength or weakness of the dollar has nothing to do with the price of the commodity. Commodity price is driven by increasing demand resulting in shortage or perceived shortage.<br /><br />\\"Commodities are so pervasive that, in my view, you really cannot be a successful investor in stocks, bonds, or currencies without understanding them.\\" Investing in commodities can be a hedge against a bear market, rampant inflation, and a major downturn in the economy. One reason in the 1980s and 1990s companies and stocks did so well was raw materials were in a bear market and investors realized in the late 1990s the commodity bear market was ending and the stock bull market was coming to an ending, also. The bear commodity market came to an end in 1998 reaching a 20 year low. The cost of doing business was eating away profits taking drive for growth away from companies. Millions of investors listening to experts advocating the new economy were financially hammer and are still trying to break even.<br /><br /> Why buy commodities now? The current supply-and-demand balance for commodities worldwide is out whack. Time will turn any oversupply of a commodity into an empty warehouse unless its inventory is replenished. Demand for supplies increased and years of cheap oil drove a taste for gas guzzlers; low mortgage rates increased the size of homes and the cost too heat and cool them; bigger cars and home ate up lumber, steel, aluminum, and lead. Now China has started to gobble up commodities. China has the fast growing economy in the world for 2003-2004 at 9 percent. China imports half of its copper, three-fifths of its iron ore, and one-third of its oil; and draining Europe re-cycle plants of every bit of scrape they can produce. China must feed 1.3 billion people and the Chinese are eating more meat increasing the demand for corn feed; China is importing Soy from Brazil and Australia; and China is importing more sugar. All at a time when China is short of every raw material that it needs. The imbalance is exploding demand while supplies are being depleted. Let look at the basic survival commodities: Oil, Natural Gas, Metal, and Sugar. Oil: No Major oil field discoveries, giant reservoirs are 50 to 70 years old, no new U.S oil refineries, drilling rigs decreased from 4,530 to 1,201 (1981-2004). U.S officials and companies are looking to Russia to pump enough oil to satisfy hunger for energy. Natural gas: North America has not kept pace with demand and officials are expressing alarm about possible prolonged shortages of natural gas. Gas fields in Canada and Alaska are still without pipelines to bring gas to the market. Metals: No new mine shafts in 20 years world-wide. Sugar has become an energy commodity having been turned into ethanol to power vehicles. More than 60 percent of the world's ethanol is produced from sugar. Brazil is promoting ethanol sales in China. War and political chaos push commodity prices higher.ing rigs decreased from 4,530 to 1,201 (1981-2004).

Marketing communications for services haul a heavier burden than communications for products.  We trust products but we are far less trusting of services.  So communications about services must make the service more tangible and real and must sooth the worried prospect.<br /><br />People are interested in themselves.  Turn the attention away from \\"I'm an expert\\", \\"I'm the smartest\\", \\"me, me, me\\" and turn the attention to the client.  Indifference is the worst enemy not competition.  When you do speak say one thing.  Saying many things usually communication nothing.  Your prospects have one question \\"What makes you so different that I should do business with you?\\"  So give them one good reason to do business with you then repeat it again and again.  Don't use adjectives to explain your reasons, use stories.  Work one good basic communication; the communication must be vivid and not unclear, concrete and not abstract, familiar and not unfamiliar, and proper nouns not adjectives.  Create evidence of your service and then communicate your service quality.  Don't use silly or unprofessional promotional ideas.  Prospects don't necessary want to buy the best, they just don't want to buy bad; so, help assure the prospect that you have weakness, you are good enough, and they can be comfort with selecting you.  Convey that you are positively good.  The client will continue using your service, if the client feels comfortable with them.  The golden rule of marketing applies: \\"It is far better to say too little than too much.\\"<br /><br />People hear what they see.  When people watch commercials they don't hear words, they see pictures.  For example, an attorney climbing a mountain caused people to say that \\"First Banks were strong and solid, like the man climbing the mountain\\".  People will trust their eyes far before they will ever trust your words.  Make the invisible visible by using visual symbols to look for clues about what the business is about: Prudential has it's Rock of Gibraltar, Travelers is umbrella, Allstate is good hands, TransAmerica its tower, and Wausau its railroad station.  Make sure people see who you are.  Make sure your visual communications are consistent and reinforcing through out your company, it make you look more organized and professional and easier to remember.  If your selling something complex, simplify it with a metaphor.  Metaphors can quickly define your concept and your uniqueness.<br /><br />If you want publicity then advertise.  Prospect believe advertising is publicity and creditability.  Advertising is the source by which people come to know the companies mentioned in the ad.  People do not believe in companies they have not heard.  Write articles and if you want editors to help you then give them something interesting.  Give them a story worth publishing.  Look deeply there are interesting stories to be told.<br /><br />Focus on Buying and not selling.  Think of the opposite side ask the customer \\"What do you want; what do you need; who are you\\".  Make buying easy for the customer.  Talk with the prospect about them and not you.<br /><br />People want to smile.  The most important thing you can sell is hope.  Hope makes people feel good and customers that feel good will continue to give you business.ymbols to look for clues about what the business is about: Prudential has it's Rock of Gibraltar, Travelers is umbrella, Allstate is good hands, TransAmerica its tower, and Wausau its railroad station.

The end result of any market research project can be engineered to give a predictable outcome. For example, in a sampling of 18 people - questions were ask about a specific product likes and dislikes and a conclusion drawn about the product.  Next, the pool size was increased to 500 people with the similar characteristics found in the first 18 person sample and surprising the same marketing research results were achieved.  So, marketing decisions driven by market research can be hazardous, if absolute faith in the conclusions of the Research are followed.  Also, too further break down reliance on market research, Beckwith states that people exhibit the Heisenburg principle meaning people change their behavior when they are being studied.  Beckwith concludes, soft research is better than hard research and the bottom line is to listen to the customer.<br /><br />The Marketing has fallacies. Best practices make an invitation to ordinariness.  Instead of following Best practices, innovate and create best practices.<br /><br />Focus on satisification and equate quality too price believing that customer who have perspection of receiving quality will pay a higher price. Price discounting works in special cases. Price discounting is designed too acquire new customers and destroy competitor profit margins causing them to collaspe.  For most companies discounting only attracts the wrong type of customer.<br /><br />Focus on achieving customer satisification rather than cutting price. Customers, who are bargin hunters will flee to businesses that offer lower price.  These type of customers are always looking for cheaper product and customer loyalty is a function of price.  For every one large discount store, it destorys 100 smaller businesses while attract high volume of customers at low prices and profit margins.  These companies expect people to buy more product because of the lower price and profit off the higher volume of sales.  So, the lower profit margin per product is offset by higher volume of products sold.  The only way to combat the discount business model is to offer better service, more specialized products, and a stronger focus on meeting customer expectations.  Rather than seeking larger numbers of people, emphasis a business model with a selective group of customers with more disposable money, and selective tastes for products and services; stay on the upper pyramid of product and service differentiation.  For example, Boston Market thought, if they offer discount coupons, they would increase foot traffic into their stores and the clientele would love their food.  So they offer coupons and increased traffic, slowed down service time per customer, fustrated the clientele that should have become their loyal customers and attracted the wrong type of customer.  Boston Market stock valued at $41 share price plummetted to 33 cents, as the company cut its coupons and the clientele seeking discount priced food fled.  The prime customer was also fed up with delayed service and the company entered Chapter 11.<br /><br />Build Brand as a mental expection that the customer believes he will get.  Branding has become the most effective when customers nolonger are willing to do comparative pricing and analysis and instead select a product because of its brand.  Brand is the symbol that people associate with a specific expectation which is often better than reality.  Brand can create an expectation so strong that the customer ignores diminished quality and value in the product or service. Brand represents the symbol companies seeks to position in the minds of the customer.<br /><br />Packaging adds beauty to the product and reinforces the brand.<br /><br />Focus on the customer relationship.  Seek customers like yourself.  This does two things: 1) Increases understanding of the customer and predictablity of his responses 2) Reduces complaints and nonsolvable conflicts with unsatisified customers.uct is offset by higher volume of products sold.

Trump made his wealth in real estate and the location of choice was Manhattan where prices were soaring to 1,000 dollars a square foot. Trump hedged on the belief that real estate prices would go up, rather, than down, and leveraged properties values to acquire more investment money. If values were going up - leveraging only increased profits without risking extreme losses, a win-win situation. Why would this fact be important? The negative risk factor suggested extreme exposure for Trump because the investment was an asset intensive liability and in a negative financial economy, fatal. What would be the odds that Manhattan Real Estate would drop in value? If Real Estate prices dropped caused by economic downturns or market reversal trends and would lead too massive debt, on the books; creditors would be forced to liquidate the property, but, as long as, the creditors did not call this debts in, survival was possible. An another risk that Real Estate presented was Trumps money was not liquid. Money lossing would increase and Real Estates would be difficult to onload and time would be the enemy.<br /><br />Trump may have realized this fact and moved into Casinos because this form of Real Estate was more stable and the cash flow not so cyclic. Trump continued to market Manhattan Real Estate because the strategy of promotion made him money. Manhattan Real Estate to become the standard for the wealth and Trump Towers the brand for the Real Estate. The rich seemed to sponser him and this was the right customer for him. Thinking like a billionare mindset has nothing to do with the middle class or lower class. I am sure Trump distains the incompetence and lifestyles of the middle class and would find it inconceivable to understand the lifestyle of the poor.<br /><br />The Trump Towers are the classic design and branding too attract potential buyers seeking an upperclass lifestyle: tourist centered landscapes, beautiful interior designs, and prestige of the community. The price seemed to suggest quality for the real-estate investment. The rich seem happy with Trump's lifestyle because it matched their own.<br /><br />At one point, Trump acknowledged, he had billions of dollars in debt. Trump says, his father told him that he had perfect confidence in Trump too pull through the crisis. However, Fred Trump had a different style than Donald Trump. Perhaps, the real meaning behind Fred's statement was that Fred really was saying, he knew Donald had 100 percent confidence in his ability to make money and Donald should not doubt this ability because doubt could kill the future.<br /><br />Trump gives a small excerpt about his turn-around which occurred during a dinner appointment with one of the bankers. Supposedly, the banker helped Trump realize a problem, understand a new solution, and see a new vision for the future direction of the company. Why didn't Trump talk about the advice that changed his life and saved his company? This amazes me that Trump would mention such an important event only to skim the details.<br /><br />What type of person is Trump? If Trump represents the bulk of all Billionares then assume Billionares don't think much different than normal people: 1. they look for value 2. they don't like to waste opportunities 3. they believe in helping people 4. they trust the people around them 5. and they believe in honesty, hard work, and integrity 6. they seek happiness and personal fulfillment.<br /><br />Trump would argue that he is a pragmatic, hedonistic epicurian with a zest for life. Interestingly, Trump attempts to give Buffettology advice on investing, bad choice. It seems that Trump is not the expert as Buffet on investing and purchasing companies. Trump does not use technical formalized methods for measuring investment value and opportunity like Buffet does. I would not trust his advice based on his statements like I do Buffet.<br /><br />Trump claims to trust his instincts, trust his lawyers, trust his brokers, trust his interior designer, and trust his board members. Trump says, he pays them a significant amount of money to give him good advice. Trump does not think reliance on technology is necessary. I think Trump is making a big mistake with this belief. Digital business design is the wave of the future and he is missing it. A Digital Business Design could allow Trump to leverage the Trump brand without owning assets, something Trump is already doing.<br /><br />Trump encourages attention to detail. Trump advises the reader to watch every detail because money is in the detail. Trump claims money is lost in every deal that lack negotiating power. Trump brags not so much about his empires wealth as much as about his own financial genius. This was a strange remark. What is to say that Trump acheived financial dominance because of family money. Old money is the single greatest reason for extreme wealth accumulation. Innovation is the greatest reason for an increase in the wealth. I really didn' hear Trump talk about any innovations in real-estate. This leads me to believe his wealth was old money.<br /><br />However, Trump claims to only have met 47 of the 587 billionares in the world suggesting his wealth was individually earned, a personal war - a single soldier. What do I believe about Trump's mindset? It is ordinary. Perhaps, that is his point that he is an ordinary person with an exordinary amount of money.<br /><br />The real issue Trump should have brought up is how he turned his debt ridden company into profit oriented company. Perhaps, the verdict was not out. Perhaps Trump could not claim victory cause the future for him was so unstable.<br /><br />Trump would agree every dollar matters in business. Trump worship of beauty caused him to waste millions of dollars on projects that cost rather than profit. Beauty without profit is contradictory. How can one trade a family for a more beautiful celebrity and call that profitable? Trump belief is too reducing pain and increase pleasure by getting along, molding morality to fit the circumstance, and keeping everyone who effects him satisfied and free of pain.<br /><br />The media strategy is designed to get Trump, out in front by showing how great a life a billionare lifestyle can be, and at the same ignore the pain of the bottom line facts. The bottom line facts could save Trump one day. The bottom line fact I would want to know is how Trump reversed a losing business model and turned into a profit oriented model. Did Trump reduce asset intensive investments and move to Mortgage financing? Did Trump discover a tax scheme that would give him an financial advantage by selling his name rather than owning assets? Did Trump sell of Casinos, buildings, and properities that were an operational cash drain? Why doesn't Trump talk about the real issues? Has Trump moved from being a hard as nails business man to a celebrity? Trump would argue it is all about marketing.rchasing companies.

Management must move away from product-centric thinking and migrate to customer-centric solutions.  Re-Inventors know that customer-centric solutions help identify the business design modification and enhancements to invest resource, talent, and raw materials to build.  Customer expectations, beliefs, and problems are constantly changing.  Companies, who listen to their customers' needs and priorities are more likely to change processes to meet those customer needs.<br /><br />Traditionally, companies have focused on selling more to anyone willing to buy products and services.  The driving belief was growth was a function of capturing larger amounts of market share.  This belief is not factually true.  Many companies gained significant market share only to discover, they were not growing in profits.<br /><br />The authors main argument is that market share does not equate always to profits because the customers needs and priorities are changing.  This observed fact means companies not responding to the customer needs and priorities will loss market share even if they currently have massive market share.  Failure to hear the customer needs and priorities will lead to the lost of profits: IBM (IBM had the market share in mainframes)yet faced decreasing trends in profits.  IBM moved towards customer solutions.  IBM mainframe business struggled (Read Who said Elephants can't dance) - IBM moved to solutions.  IBM profits increased as they responded to the customer not the fact that they acheived market share.  Market share is an indicator the company is meeting the customer needs not the reason to meet the customer needs.  The egg before the chicken philosophy where meeting the customer needs produces the gold egg of profits.<br /><br />As with more of the same philosophy so was the advocacy.  Companies continued focusing on what they did well and continue tryingtoo sell more of the same without understanding the needs and priorities of the customers; sustaining a false premise that more of an unwanted or unresponsive product will generate high profits.  When companies were small, they listen to their customers; when they became a mid size companay, they struck a balance in between the company and the customer; and as a large company they mostly ignored the customer needs and a priorities and focused on company productivity.  So the company eventually focused only on increasing efficiency and delivering products with the goal of gaining market share believing revenue would be generated from each unit sold.  The internet and high speed communication has changed everthing.  Business are becoming more digital and companies are expected to respond to the customers needs and priorities.<br /><br />The most important question to ask is \\"How do I get paid?\\"  Without a clear understanding of how profit is generated and how a business must be designed, there will be no profit. Next ask: \\"Who are my customers?  Which customers do I not want?\\" Next ask: who are my innermost competitors? How are they meeting the needs and priorities of customers and thus taking away business.  Who are my external competitors?  Competitors that are emerging with disruptive technology that will meet the silent needs of my customers.\\"  Last, \\"What do I need to do to gain dominance in the market space?\\"<br /><br />Start by identifying the profit model or models that explain, \\"How do we make money?\\"<br /><br />22 Profit Models<br /><br />1. Customer Solutions (Invest to know the customer, create a solution, develop the relationship.<br />2. Product Pyramid (At the base are products and services that are low price and high volume; at the top products and services that are high price and low volume)<br />3. Multi-Component (Several of the components represent a disproportionate share of the profits)<br />4. Switchboard (Multiple sellers communicating with multiple buyers.  The more buyers and sellers join the great the organization builds on itself.)<br />5. Time Profit (Takes advantage of uniqueness, profit margins erode as competition seeks to imitate.

King Edward VII recognized as a hero Shackleton and knighted him.<br /><br />1914-1916 Endurance expediation lead Shackleton and his men 1200 miles from civilization and in one of the worst situations possible.  Pack ice had trapped, dragged the ship for ten months, and eventually crushed the ship.  The men had to rely on life boats salvaged from the ship.  The men endure temperature far below zero, four months of darkness, survived on a diet of penguin, seal, and sometimes dog.  Once the ice began to melt the men moved to the life boats and spent week fighting for their lives before hitting land, Elphant Island and at Elephant Island the men spent most of their time huddle under overturn boats.  The men suffered extreme boredom, starvation, extreme discomfort, and lost of hope.  Shackleton offer his men hope.  Shackleton was charming both a poet and adventure.  His men never doubt Shackleton's discipline and Shackleton's  brotherhood with his men help overcome intense boredom as they sang songs, played games, and wrote of their experiences.<br /><br />Shackleton decided to take five men and sailed 800 miles in the most sever weather and oceanic conditions to South Georgia and return and rescue his men.  The interesting fact about the journey was Shackleton planned to succeed by sailing to South Georgia using Star navigation, and if, the navigation was any degree imprecise their deaths were sealed.  The Altantic has some of the harshess waves, it is amazingly cold, and no modern expediation has successfully completed the Shackleton crossing to Georgia.  The Altantic ocean was too much.<br /><br />Upon reaching South Georgia, Shackleton realizes they are on the wrong side and proceeded to accomplish another amazing feat, the crossing over of the South Georgia Mountain, at the only time of the year possible for the crossing.  The whalers were in awe of Shackelton and his partners as they walked down the mountain.  They seemed invincible.  Shackleton turns right around and launches a rescue mission for his trapped men on Elphant Island.  Not one man was lost in the expedition and his men shout for joy in seeing their captain Shackleton approach to rescue them.<br /><br />\\"I love the fight and when things are easy, I hate it\\".<br /><br />British explorer Apsley Cherry-Garrard, \\"For a join scientific and geographical piece of organization, give me Scott; for a winter journey, give me Wilson, for a dash to the Pole and nothing else, Amundsen; and if I am in the devil of a hole and want to get out of it, give me Shackleton every time.\\"<br /><br />\\"By endurance we conquer\\".  Shackleton replaced the War Hero of World War I with the exploration hero.  Shackleton gave hope to the world.  Men died for honour, instead of fearing death.  Europe and America were invigorated with Shackleton's courage.<br />\\"He had a quick brain, and he could visualize things a head, and as far as he could he safeguarded any eventuality that was likely to occur\\" - Lionel Greenstreet<br /><br />\\"His method of discipline was very fair.  He did not believe in unnecessary discipline.\\" - William Bakewell<br /><br />\\"No matter what turns up, he is always ready to alter his plans and make fresh ones, and in the meantime laughs, jokes, and enjoys a joke with everyone, and in this way keeps everyone's spirits up\\" - Frank Worsley.at the only time of the year possible for the crossing.

Different personality types contribute significanly differently to the epidemic.<br /><br />A connector knows a vast number of people because of their diversity of interest.  A connector is a good communicator.  However, a connector by himself can not always cause a trend.  Paul Revere was an example of connector that caused an epidemic response to the English invasion.  Both Paul Revere and William Dawes road through the countryside warning the British were coming.  Some historians think the region where Dawes road was pro-British.  The truth was people responded differently to Dawes message as compared to Reveres.  The connector type attempts to explain how human beings are connected.  The connector type demonstrates how information travels through and population.  The theory is that everyone is connected or linked to someone through six steps of association.  Connector types are link to more people than average within 2-3 steps.  Connectors take advantage of weak ties.  Weak ties are more powerful than strong ties, so proximity can have the same impact as similarity or better.<br /><br />The Maven should be treated as the most valuable indentity in all trends.  Trend momentum is signficantly influenced by the Maven.  Mavens can make or break a product trend.  Their opinions can generate incredible demand.  Marketing should focus the wealth of their funding to appeal to the Mavens rather than the masses.  The message is Market the Mavens and listen to their feedback.  Winning is getting the support of the Maven<br /><br />The Mavens evaluation and opinion significant influence the masses opinions.  Bottom line, don't upset the Maven.  Market to the special interests and comparative interest of the Maven.  A few Mavens can make a significant impact on a trend.  The Maverns are experts.  A Maven specializes in certain domains of knowledge.  Mavens are teachers.  Mavens are not necessarily persuasive in style. Mavens are known for their knowledge and social skills.  When a Maven speaks their associates listen and believe.  A Maven can use his skills to start or stop an epidemic trend.are not necessarily persuasive in style.

LTCM was too big, possessing $128 billion in assets and $3.6 billion in the bank and 2/5 of money belonging to the owners. Notation derivates reaching leverage 100 to 1 preventing rapid sell off and bankruptcy out of question, for bankruptcy would have caused a world cascade economic crash and loses reaching above $1 trillion. Bankruptcy was not an option; LTCM was too big to fail and the Fed knew it. LTCM only chance was too secure money from warranties, loans, or a buy out; none of which in the end would save them. In the end, the Feds 16 banks would invest $250 million each with a total accumulation of $4 billion dollars rescuing LTCM and the partners would leave with relatively nothing in their pockets. How did smartest guys on Wall Street fail? How did the impossible happen?<br /><br />1997, Indonesia, Rupiah dropped 85 percent as currency traders forced devaluation revealing a corrupt banking practices and overextension of bad credit; volatility rose to 27 percent.<br /><br />1998 LTCM bet that no future recession would occur and believed the Bond margins would narrow. Instead, the world economy were experience new global forces as communism was breaking down, China's GNP was heating up, and East Germany was experiencing new economic freedoms. A U.S - 56 point margin increase on the swap, England - 45 point margin, and German - 20 point margin and LTCM was losing money on all of its markets. LTCM had previously negotiated a warrant by UBS and UBS was being seriously exposed while LTCM was claiming \\"Future expected returns are good\\" although Equity Volume was in trouble, Swap margins were increasing, and Treasuries were falling as investors fled to safer securities and as Treasuries were being bought up their rates dropping to 5.56.<br /><br />With Indonesia falling - all eyes were turned to Russia. There was no rescue by the IMF for the Russian ruble. Shares in Europe and Turkey were weak and Venezuelans were buying dollars all the while swaps margins increased. Aug 21, the Dow fell 280 points and investors continued to prefer the safest bonds, the 30 year treasures, US swaps increased to 76 points, 20 points in one day, Britain swaps increased to 62 points and mortgage spreads spread to 121 points, high yield climbed to 276, and treasurers were at 13. LTCM lost $558 million in a single day, 15 percent of their capital. LTCM was certain the markets would correct rationally and the spreads converge. Losses accumulated faster because leverages increased. Additional $200 million in funding was requested from Merrill Lynch. Hedge funds were not considered a bank and so credit extension regulation was constrained. The drop in LTCM performance caused banks to tighten their credit lines to hedge funds. In fact, the hedge funds poor performance screamed default and banks demanded their entitlement to repayment. LTCM was very close to insolvency. Mattone told Meriwether, \\"when you're down by half, people figure you can go down all the way\\" and \\"your out\\". Aug 31, the DOW crashed 512 points, Hong Kong Authority stopped supporting local markets by buying local shares. For the month of Aug, LTCM had lost $1.9 billion, 45 percent of its equity capital, and still had $125 billion in derivative assets. Death was imminent, the leveraging could not be stopped, LTCM was immobilized by its size, and Bear was threatening to suspend trading. After reviewing LTCM books, Bear allowed LTCM trades and gave a harsh warning, if they dropped below $500 million all trades would halt.<br /><br />Sep 10, LTCM experiences a sum lose of $500 million dollar for five days of trading. LTCM still has 7,000 derivative contracts totaling $1.4 trillion dollars.<br /><br />In 1987, Alan Greenspan was appointed as chairman of the Federal Reserves.

By Divine mandate, all people have certain inalienable rights mainly the right to life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness.  The sovereignty of a nation is vested in the people.  The source of sovereignty is held by the people and when the powers are granted by the people too the rulers, they must be limited in scope.  The rulers do not have a God given right to expand their powers beyond the limited scope established by the people meaning no law or taxation creation should occur without representation which is the voice of the people.<br />2. No Nation can violate the inalienable rights of its people without facing the judgment of God.  The principle of freedom is based on liberty.  Slavery does not exist except in the minds of those who are slaves.  A slave must believe they can be controlled, deprived, and willfully submit too oppression.  Slavery is contrary transfers sovereignty of the people too their masters willfully.  All people have certain inalienable rights which can never be taken away, unless they willfully inactivate these rights.  For example, in many states, slave masters could not kill their slaves.  Slaves had a right to life.<br />3. A sovereign nation should be governed by a written constitution which careful defines separation of power.  Foremost in importance is the legislative body creates law.  Legislatures are employed by the people through free elections.  Free elected representatives represent the interest of the people or voted out next election.<br />4. The constitution should clearly set forth the fundamental rights of the people.  Madison wisely understood the need to enumerate the right of the people in the Bill of Rights.  The first eight were written by Madison too protect fundamental rights of the individual: freedom of religion, press, speech, right to own arms, due process of the law, equal protection of the law, a fair trial, protection against self incrimination, habeas corpus, right to counsel, too cross examine their accusers, a speedy trial, a right to a jury when serious charges a filed, reasonable bail, protection against cruel and usual punishment, and narrowly defined interpretation and application of treason.  Powers not express granted to the Federal government must be reserved too the States.  Central government limitations must be clearly defined.<br />5. No king should ever rule in America.  The legislative body is the only power capable of declaring war.  War debts should be paid immediately.  War should be defensive and war powers held temporarily.  No one person should have the power of a dictator in America.<br />6. The military must remain subject to the civil authorities.  The legislative body has the right and responsibility to review all charges of war crimes and atrocities.  The Senate and House of Representatives have the power to start and stop war.<br />7. The government must allow religion to operate freely among the people.  The long term influence of the Puritans allowed the doctrines of the Anglo Saxons too be maintained from the time of William the Conquer, King John, Cromwell, Jefferson.  The Puritans represented 2/3 of Parliament:  they revoked repress laws, were needed to raise taxes, and had the power to remove an incompetent king.  The Puritans transplanted their influence too America and helped establish a free government of America.  Freedom of religion was fundamental to the Puritan belief system.  The Puritans linked back too the Anglo Saxon birthright.  The Anglo Saxons learned Latin and studied the bible and recognized numerous elements of the Law of Mose similar to their own doctrines: such as, local governments of 10 families and 100 families and a representative government.  Governments do not have the right to deny the God given right too worship and practice according too their religion.<br />8. All men are created equal which means equal before God, equal in their rights, and equal before the bar of justice.<br />9. All mankind were designed by God to be free<br />10. The central government must never take away from the people the ability too defend themselvesl mankind were designed by God to be free<br />10.

Similarly, if governmental interests preempt a man's land and the grounds for justification are not compelling as necessary for the welfare and security of the nation then the government is expected to pay fair market compensation for the land.  A Laissez-faire ensured government encroachment in business would be held too a minimum allowing commerce to flourish through free trade.  Often times the Supreme Court did not feel competed too impose their opinions of business on the market and remained neutral.<br />Federal courts began establishing a dominate of pattern of reversing jury decisions for physical damages and punitive damages award by juries.  Sometimes the cases involved a conflict between and individual and a business, an individual against another individual represented by a silent insurance company, or a state regulation against a business.  In over 70 percent of the cases appeal to a federal court, the court reversed the decision of the jury.<br />The Supreme Court ruling in Hancock established that judges held the power to tell juries what the law is.  So, Judges instructed juries on the meaning of the law.  Judges specific told juries what laws should apply to the case and which laws to ignore.  Even before a trial started, a judge could decide, who should win the case.  In both the Silkwood and Pringer federal cases involving a federal judge reversed the punitive damages.  The reason for reverse in Silkwood suggested that a state could not regulate Kerr-McGee, a private nuclear business, instead that was the job NRC, a federal agency.  NRC had over 500 filings on record against Kerr-McGee and no formal litigation.  In Pringer, a Federal Judge reversed the Ms Wyoming defamation suite because the stories sold too 26 million men were fantasy and not reality therefore no direct damage could be assigned.  Federal courts preempt the rulings and regulations of State courts when the punishments are excessive causing appeal.  It seems the federal courts force state courts to preempt.

US	52769921	R1GTOAYA5GJ3ZR	0767908171	997649583	A Short History of Nearly Everything	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Just like on PBS	I like Bill Bryson's writing style.  This is a book one wishes they read as a teenager.  It really brings science alive.  One feels like they are witnessing events as they occur in the first person.  I like how Bryson takes scientific topics and makes them simple too understand.  Bryson puts numbers in perspective and helps the reader understand the spatial enormity or complexity of the elements, atom, planets, and stars.  Its easy to retell a Bryson story because they have good imagination well connect ideas that flow into an interesting story without sounding too intellectual.  Like, &quot;What is it like to be inside of an Cell?  How do cells work?  Who discovered DNA and why?&quot;  Question like these.<br />I think reading &quot;A Short History of Nearly Everything&quot; is a great introduction to science, astronomy, biology, and geology.  Bryson keeps the narrative down to earth, terminology to a minimum, and brings out interesting viewpoints on the birth of the cosmos, the self-repairing DNA, life on planet earth, and the composition of the earth.<br />Bryson did a job not boring the reader with the mysteries of science.  Its entertaining reading and not difficult material to understand. Bryson presents thought provoking material that makes one want to read many other published books by Bryson.	2004-06-03

Nevertheless, Ender is a killer, a dark character, darker than Peter. The buggers view humans as not intelligent and excessively brutal and violent. The Buggers attack earth and start a war. The buggers could have originated from earth, are mentally connected, and travel the space distance faster than the speed of light.<br />Peter is the antagonist. However, Peter never kills, he manipulates, threats, and twists both Valentine and Ender to conform with his plots. It is Ender's desire to receive Peter's love. Peter and Ender divide as brothers with Ender becoming a great general and Peter the controlling political force of earth. Peter becomes Locke and Valentine, Demosthenes using their father citizen key to gain access to the nets. Locke and Demosthenes are recognized as great political writers controlling the minds of people of the earth; Locke supports the Warsaw pact and Demosthene a moderate view appealing to the common man for the war. After Ender destroys the buggers, Locke ostracizes Ender to the Bugger world. In the last effort repudiation of Peter, Valentine leaves with Ender to the Bugger world. Ender will arrive at the bugger world in two years, realize familiar scene from the desktop, find a the queen hive, and desire to restore the buggers.<br /><br />Interestingly Ender never realizes, he has killed both Stilson and Bonzo, instead he believes his victories are a product of superior intelligence, remorse is never a part of the experience; the I.F carefully controls Ender to produce an objective killing machine. So, Ender believes pain is good and pain can be used to control or defeat enemies. Even after being betrayed by the I.F, Ender realized he was glad too be a survivior and rejoices in not being killed by the buggers with his friends. Ender's soldier revered him as their commander.<br /><br />General Pace and Colonel Graf careful protected Ender and manipulated him into becoming the supreme commander of the I.F forces against the buggers. Ender training forms him into a fanastic commander, order intricate battle advancements, sacrifices, and surprising offensive tactics. Ender learns to always win, sometimes breaking the rules to win, but always winning. The game becomes reality. Ender learns from Maser Rankham the first bugger victory came when Rankam surprised the buggers by attacking the queen ship, apparently the bugger never thought such an attempt could be done and once the queen was dead the drones were helpless because the collective mind links were useless and so they eventual all died.<br /><br />The supreme command had to be young. Ender was young, seven when he entered the academy and twelve when he lead the I.F forces against the buggers. Youth allowed Ender's inhibitions to act too remain at a minimum; he was willing to take risks and adapt with creative strategies and attack patterns; the result being defeat of all the training armies in the school: fatique odds matching him unevenly against multiple armies, unfair advantages, and eventually 1000 to 1 game scenerios were all part of the game. Ender learns the Greek warfare lesson, \\"if you want to win, don't play the enemies games.\\" In the case of 300 Spartians depending a narrow pass against hundreds of thousands of Persians with kill ratios around 15,000 men to one Spartian. Decisive victories with limited resources, this is the brillance of Ender Wiggin. Ender's grooming by Maser Rankham and taught him how to use the Dr Device weapon, a weapon that can cause molecules to disperse, a weapon used to destroy the home of the buggers. Ender realized the game was real, Ender realized he did not want to destroy the buggers, Ender realized the system used him to eradicate all the buggers, and in the end just one soldier in the war, his opinions didn't matter. The true power remained in the hands of the politicians and Peter controlled the politicians.eapon used to destroy the home of the buggers.

Life is comfortable, neither too hot nor too cold. Obviously in the old world, glaciers formed in a time when the earth was too cold, likewise, volcanic activity and vegatation growth made the earth too hot with thick clouds of C02. The earth is perfect for man containing water, oxygen, O3, and a magnetic field. The mass of the earth is perfect allowing the right gavitational and rotational orbit, changes in the winter and summer tilt. Even the milky way is perfectly balanced. If the milky way had a massive star in the center or a black hole gravitational forces would be too strong on the sun. Timing is also important.

God forbid that we ever become ashamed or discouraged, at our desire to stand blameless before God. We must turn to God, repenting of our sins, and avoid rationalizing weakness by reducing God's expectations for us. The dichotomy becomes no unclean thing can enter into the kingdom of God; and, one must be perfect to enter back into the kingdom. So, when man sins, he falls short of the glory of God. Therefore, we must cast off sin, resist the devil, and bring about much righteous of our own free will and choice. Remember, death and sin were overcome by the grace of Christ.	2004-02-17

Sinai	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Saudi Arabia	Jabal Al Lawz<br />At the age of eighty, the Jehovah instructed Moses to free the children of Israel, wander the coastline of Eygpts Sinai, cross the Red Sea into Saudi Arabia, and lead a nation for forty years. Why Saudi Arabia? Because Jabal Al Lawz is located in Saudi Arabia, the mountain of Moses, the place of antiquity, and it has managed to remain preserved for two millenniums by a closed Saudi society.<br /><br />Moses ascended the 7800-7900 foot mountain approaching into a consuming fire. To the Israelites, the mountain rumbled with power, smoke ascended from its crown, the children of Israel could smell the burning of granite, and a brilliant fire could be seen at a great distance. Only Mose saw the Lord face to face. To the rest of the children of Israel, Jehovah appeared in a pillar of fire.<br /><br />The fire of God was hot enough to melt the surface of the brown granite into a coal color, black, obsidian, textured glass, with the core remaining brown granite. An angelic trumphet blasted from the top of the Mountain of God announcing the presence of Jehovah. “Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the Lord descended on it in fire. The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace, the whole mountain trembled violently” Exod 18-19 . After, Moses descended from the Holy Mount, his face radiated with the power of God. The children of Israel requested Mose put a veil over his face to block the radiance. The children of Israel had withdrawn to safer purses while Mose communicated with Jehovah.<br /><br />The power of Jehovah brought fear upon the children of Israel, and in the forty days and forty nights Moses remained on the mountain, they began to encourage Aaron to build them a gold calf. The stone cutter used the granite to build a massive alter and employed thousands of Israelites to move the stones into place. The altar was flat on the top. Aaron allowed the apostate Israelites to use the gold from jewelry to metal-work a golden calf. “Take off the gold earrings that your wives, your sons and your daughters are wearing, and bring them tome.” “These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.” “Tomorrow there will be a festival to the Lord.” Exod 32:1-5 A pictograph of a male bull was etched in the granite of the altar. Saudi Arabia was not known for large herds of cattle. Mose later would destroy the golden calf, grind up the gold, punish by death the apostates, and distribute the power gold down the stream flowing from the rock of Horeb.<br /><br />Also, near the summit is a large rock with a laser-like seam descending from top to bottom with a near perfect gap of 19 inches. At the base of this rock is the same burned rock that embedded the crown of the summit. The Horeb rock was probably the location where Moses brought forth a geyser of water to quench the thirst of about 2 million people. Water erosion at the base of the rock suggests the flow of the water from the geyser was fast-running water. “He brought streams out of a rocky crag and made water flow down like rivers.” “When he struck the rock, water gushed out, and streams flowed abundantly” (Ps 78:16,20) “He split the rocks in the desert and gave them water as abundant as the seas” (Ps 78:15)<br /><br />A near perfect semi-circle extended around Mount Jabal Al Lawz, and every 400 yards, a marker of rocks was piled. The markers protective semi-circle warned the children of Israel to not go past the markers. The penalty for crossing the markers was death. “Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death” (Exod 19:12). The Israelite community may be expected to punish the trespasser with death or perhaps Jehovah would destroy the trespasser.<br /><br />Also found at the base of the mountain were pens for sacrificial animals. A V shaped formation could be seen from the summit.<br /><br />Moses took 12 stones and built a altar representing the 12 tribes of Israel. At the base of Mount Jabal Al Lawz are the remains of stone columns. “Moses … got up early the next morning and built an altar at the foot of the mountain and set up twelve stone pillars representing the twelve tribes of Israel. Then he sent young Israelite men, and they offered burnt offerings and sacrificed young bulls as fellowship offerings to the Lord.” (Exod 24:4-5)<br /><br />In Al Bad, Acacia wood is plentiful. Acacia wood was used to build the ark of the covenant, the alters of incense, the table it resided on, and the tent poles.<br /><br />In Elim, twelves springs with sweet water exist. In Marah, the bitter springs made sweet as Mose pleaded to the Lord and was instructed to throw a piece of wood into the water that healed it. (Exod 15:25)<br /><br />The cross of the Red sea could be near the Straits of Tiran.<br /><br />At the base of Jabal Al Lawz there is a valley large enough to camp over 2 millions inhabitants.<br /><br />Why the secrecy? It is a known fact, the Moslems revered Mose or Musa, as a Moslem prophet. The Moslems of Tabuk can reaccount the history and lineage of Mose’s family. The Moslems knew of Elijah’s cave. There is a connection between Elijah and Mose. Elijah held the sealing keys for eternal families and Moses held the gather keys bringing families together into a grand lineage.<br /><br />Elijah must have known about the prophet Moses, who also dwelt in a cave. This region of the world brought forth two great prophets. This was a holy land. Both prophets understood the meaning of the word isolation. Jehovah brought them up out of the humblest circumstances to humble the world with his power, voice, and miracles.<br /><br />Jehovah is the God of the Holy Mount. Jehovah is Jesus Christ. Jehovah is the one and only true God. There is no other name under heavan by which man can be saved and that name is Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Christ will return to the earth. Christ’s return will mark the open of the seventh seal and an angel of God will announce his arrival through a loud blast of a trumpet that will shake the earth. The angel’s blast is to awaken and make aware the bridegroom approaches and it is a petition for the people of God, to go out and meet the bridegroom. Christ return will be with fire capable of consuming the whole earth. The elements will melt at the heat of consuming fire. The earth will receive its paradiscal glory. All the wicked will be completed burned up; the tares bundled and burned; the goats slaughtered; and no telestial being left alive. At that moment, the righteous will remember Mose, the great intercessor. The righteous will remember how Mose pleaded Israels case before Jehovah, they will know the greatness of the prophet Mose: they will appreciate Mose the liberator, the will love Mose the intercessor with Jehovah, Mose was the great prototype of Christ, Mose son-in-law to Jethro, the Midianite.

It is important to know the specific characteristics and attributes of God as given in the lectures-that he was God before the Creation; that he is the same from everlasting to everlasting that he is no respecter of persons; and that he is a God of mercy, truth, love, knowledge, power, justice, and judgment.

Its very important to carefully read each paragraph. You can miss a few steps, however, as you get more comfortable with the tool, the special effects are amazing and empowering.  For the most part the book provides step by step examples and pictures to verify your at the correct stage.  The visual aids were very helpful when I missed a step.  Here are the following techniques I liked: Gel Characters, liquid Gold and Chrome Characters, Glass pills, Carved in Stone, Glass tabs, Full metal jacket, Studio Tarp, ultimate chrome, Going for the Gold, and saturday night effects.  The book covers alot of the Photoshop functionality in under 300 pages.	2004-02-11

Everest Disaster by Jon Krakauer<br />The incredible adventure starts with a story by Ed Davis of his first hand visual experience seeing the Ark.<br />They arrive at a village with mud and rock adobe living spaces.  Davis sees hand-carved latches and lock pins, ancient oil lamps, clay vats, bowls, jars, and crude tools and what appear to be prehistoric farm implements.  Davis sees a three-foot-tall cage that appears to be petrified with vertical bars made of twisted branches that are hard as a rock.<br />The ark could was embedded in a glacier and could only be seen during certain warm years.<br />Davis notices a peculiar vineyard built around a remote village.  The village is called, \\"Where Noah Planted the Vine\\".<br />Davis' journey will traverse three caves enroute to Doomsday rock.  The first cave is located in a maze of low ravines deep in the foothills.  They follow a path called the \\"Back Door\\" to the second cave.  This was hostile territory, and they were on constant watch for Russian soldiers.  The path is treacherous with hairpin switchbacks along the razor edge of a sheer cliff.  They arrive at the second cave.  There is a strong smell of sulfur present.  They must be \\"roped together to scale an increasingly chaotic tangle of narrow ledges, steep ridges, and high cliffs\\".  There are Russians stationed below.  They reach the third cave hidden in a snow bank.  In each cave, a mysterious chef has prepared a meal of goulash for them.  Davis sees beautifully etched paintings of lions and other animals.  They climb up a jagged moraine called the Doomsday rock - \\"a great, bulbous outcropping, dropping off on one side into a mile-deep chasm.\\"<br />Davis sees a horseshoe gorge.  Davis sees \\"rocks, ice, and mountainside melding as one in the deep gorge\\" rendering everything into an inky black.  Then Davis sees the ark, \\"A huge, rectangular structure lying on its side, like a battleship stuck on a sandbar.\\"  Davis exclaims, \\"Its enormous!\\"<br />\\"Davis blinked his eyes, then realized he was looking into the craft, its dark, yawning maw easily stretching one hundred feet into the cleft of the ice.  Twisted, gnarled timbers, splintered up and out where the hull had split apart, framed the hole.\\"<br />Davis could see, a half-mile from the main section, another massive structure settled in among the boulders, its timbers ripped and protruding to one end, exactly as the first.<br />Davis gazes deeper into the cross-section cutaway of the main hull and sees 1. three distinct floors 2. frail-looking partitions and walkways 3. on top, a raised roof that ran the better length of the structure.<br />Davis creates a map of his journey, and in 1999, Team Iran is assembled.  I won't share the adventures leading up to team Iran, read the book.  Dan Toth, Dan Holbrook, Darrel Scott, Todd Phillips, Larry Williams, Bob Cornuke, and Dick Bright attempt to find the Ark using a five day visa.  They believe they know the exact location of the Ark and attempt to be the second group witnessing the structure.  The location is Mount Sabalon in Iran instead of Mount Ararat in Iraq.  They discover, Urartu, original location was in Iran and later moved.  They discover an ancient myth claiming the name of the mountain was \\"Noah's Mountain\\".  Their hopes are running high.  They are racing against time, Dan Toth is using GPS and Russian maps; under pressure, they get lost and don't start up the right trail until after hiring local guides.  They don't use GPS and the maps and rely on the local guides; the mission looked to be in jeopardy.  The guides take them back to a fork in the road and follow a \\"road by a river\\".  They ascend to 11,000 feet.  They see what they believe was the Doomsday rock spoken by Davis.  They believe the gorge is two or three miles away.  Toth identifies the gorge as \\"Davis Canyon,\\" and there is no Ark.  They leave realizing that time is up.  The book ends and it needs to continue.<br />I think the Ark was higher up on the mountain based on Davis Account.  I hope they try again.vis Canyon,\\" and there is no Ark.

While Christ was passing through Samaria from Judea to Galilee, he stopped at Jacob's well to drink water. The disciples departed in search of food and Christ remained at the well. Upon arriving at the well, Christ approached a Samarian women who was drawing water. The woman was surprised that the Lord verbally interacted with her, a Samaritian, because the Jews and Samaritians were both socially and politically separated. Samaritians were consider pagan and impure Jewish line corrupted by intermarriage with Assyrians ,after capitivity. Christ would answered the woman's question, \\"How is that thou, being a Jew, asketh drink of men, which am a woman of Samaria\\" with the reply, \\"If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee eternal life.\\"<br /><br />Image yourself in a state of dehyration caused from countless hours of walking in a hostile terrain. The texture of your tongue tasting like cotton paste and the lips split open and bleeding from exposure to the dry wind. The heat of the day and the sound of the wind blowing offer no companionship as the sweat has stopped and the pains of kidney drive one for survival. At times, the mirage of a water provide relief too strained eyes with hopes of eager anticipation of water, but only to step aimlessly toward dry deseret. Suddenly, the sound of water is detect; scrapping feet along the unlevel surface, one stumbles towards the beautiful sound of water. Reaching the waters edge, scoups of waters can not quench the fast enough; so the urge for more water causes a change of posture to a prone position next to the earth allowing increased water intake. The quest for water was never so important. Reflection of those moments of deprivation caused a strong longing not be every return to such hostile terrain and risk water deprivation. Christ is the spiritual water to a thirst world. He understood perfected the need for man to receive the water of eternal life. Without his water we would die spiritually. The Savior distinquished between the water at Jacobs well and his spiritual water by telling the women, \\"But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.\\"<br /><br />Only the faithful can tap into the living spring. \\"But unto him that keepeth my commandments I will give the mysterious of my kingdom, and the same shall be in him a well of living water, springing up unto everlasting life.\\" Why are so many spiritually thirsty?

Avoid paper derived wealth.	Save 10 percent of your money.<br /><br />The bank reposses homes, so pay it off quick. Fear reduces the wealth accumulation effect. The depression symbolized a massive reshuffling of home ownership and loss of ownership. People who lost their jobs could not pay for their homes. In the 1950s a home cost between 2500-5000 dollars. Original mortgages were designed to be paid off within 10 to 15 years. The 30 year mortgage forced homeowners to pay up to three times the values of the original purchase price. The more equity the home acquired the less money paid in interest. Eventually after thirty years the home was paid for and the title delivered. In the 1990s, the wealth accumulation was equity in the home. Home owners were using the equity to borrow and invest in other homes or improve their existing homes. Money shifted from savings accounts to real estate as low interest fed policies inticed money to move from the bank into the market.<br /><br />The power of interest compounding works for the mortgage companies through significant gains in long term growth from investments. A mortgage can be used as a tax shelter. Don't fear owning a home. The first principle is to buy a home you can afford and divert the maximum amount of money to pay of your home.<br /><br />Getting rich is a process of consistent saving program/investing program and keeping a job long term. There are three share price patterns: high to low, high to low to high, low to high.<br /><br />Lets look at the high to low pattern. Suppose an individual invests 100 dollars a pay period in the high to low scenerio; what would be the break even point? Total invested/number of shares is the break even price with the point being that the break even price is significantly lower that the average share price.<br /><br />Long term investing and dollar cost averaging allows the investor to buy cheap shares and profit handsomely as the price swings to higher prices.<br /><br />Focus on accumulating wealth through saving and investing.

It is our shield against the unthinkable	The JCS would never accept an arms reduction without a space defense program. The JCS goal was keep SDI in research avoiding deployment and increase interceptor missile deployment. The doctrine of deterrence would could through the twenth century.<br />The Reagan administration gave the Bush administration an unique opportunity to reduce arms. The Bush administration did not continue the Reagan administrations views on foreign policy with Gorbachev. The Bush administration would stop and the continuation of the Reagan summits ceased and Bush would contemplate the previous administrations philosophy and direction with disagreement. The Bush administration would take a broad interpretation of the ABM. The transition between the Reagan and the Bush administration would treat the ARM reduction opportunity like a hostile take over, replacing Shultz and Weinberger with Bush people, and resume deterrence buildup policy. Bush's differed in his view of foreign policy, not willing to take Reagan's hardline position. Bush felt Reagan's hardline rhethoric was offensive to the Soviet leadership. Reagan had openly challenged Gorbachev on issues of human rights condemning the violence. Reagan called the Soviet Union the \\"evil empire\\". Reagan's hardline position postured the United States as one of military strength, 3 to 4 percent increases for SDI, and a estimated cost of 1.6 trillion dollars to deploy SDI; inconsistency in reporting and engineering feasiblity of the chemical and X-Ray laser brightness (Daniel Graham and Teller) as a military weapon; economic drives to reduce military spending, balance the budget, and reduce inflation. Reagan's NORAD vision prompted his to dream of a defensive system capable of making the Soviet ICBM impotent eliminating the potential of first strike. Reagan realized \\"Mutal Assured Destruction\\" did not stop a first strike response, it only deterred; and with the Soviets considering the possiblity of winning a nuclear war, defensive missile systems needed to be engineered and deployed immediately. Moscow media was warning of the possiblity of U.S first strike. The fear was caused more by a pattern of military buildup than an particular doctrine. The nuclear arms races of the cold war positioned the U.S in a potential first strike position. ARM reduction talks were a mandatory must.<br /><br />Gorbachev as General Secretary was considered trustworthy, known as \\"incorruptable and courageous\\", by Soviet leadership too secure Soviet communist interests and start reform leading too social and economic structural revolution of the soviet union paving a pathway for Marxist views of property rights, freedom of press and speech, primary elections, openings for foreign investment and transplating of foreign companies, free markets and free trade, and the arms reduction. Gorbachev would raise to the status and power of President. Boris Yeltsin was critical of Gorbachev. Gorbachev would not be able to break from Russia's totalitarian past. Yeltsin would be eventually elected as president. Yeltsin would struggle with reform against the hardliners and failing expectations of previous era's. Yeltsin would face the struggle to a market economy: failure of taxation, hyper inflation shock to lifting price controls, and problems with stablizing privatization.<br />Gorbachev received a standing obviation from the U.N. after a fifteen year soviet absence caused by Brezhnev condemning speech against the U.N. Gorbachev seemed different from other Soviet leadership and Margret Thatcher seemed to agree. Gorbachev return to the U.N signals a change in Soviet strategy. The strategy did not deviate from the goal of world domination.<br />Gorbachev proposed an unique idea, \\"the complete destruction of all nuclear weapons by 2000\\" and social change for the Soviet Union. This vision would make Gorbachev, man of the year, according to Times news. The reduction of 50,000 missiles. Was the offer pragmatic and realistic? Reagan never did buyinto a 100 percent arms reduction nor believe in negotiate from a position of weakness. Reagan had forced the confrontation by building up the NATO missile arsenal.<br />The soviet military economy was bankrupt and the financial drain at a crisis level, social change was inevitable: the actual missile growth rate was lower than Soviet Analyst had originally reported, Soviet satelite terrorities conflicts could not be assured intervention, and Gorbachev would start Perestroika changing the face of communism. \\"Perestroika stimulate human initiative and creativity within the Leninist/Stalinist paradigm.\\" Reagan exploited this weakeness and put the U.S in an unique negotiating position.<br />Reagan spoke to students at the Moscow University telling them they were part of a great change in their country and had the responsibility to ensure the change was successful. The U.S Soviet talks started at the same time: the Iran-Contra scandal with North and Ponidexter (arms/drugs for hostages); and the Chernobyl disaster forcing the evacuation of a hundred thousand people.<br />Reagan, Collin Powell, and Shultz formed a tight negiotating team advising Reagan on tactics and strategy during talks with Gorbachev. Shultz work with Sheverdnadze opened up allowed talks to open between the two countries. Powell was very aware of Gorbachev's skill in debate and couched Reagan on counter tactics: more one on one private discussion, type double space notes for Reagan to follow, and maintaining control of the conversation. Gorbachev was a tough negiotator, who knew his facts and Soviet interests and he came prepared and should not be under-estimated.<br /><br />Reagan hardline rhetoric, love for America, and empathy put him one of the most unique negotiating positions in the world history: the position of achieve a realistic arms reduction. Eventually, Gorbachev would propose over a 1400 soviet missile and 429 U.S missile reduction and the beginning of START and condition SDI to stay in research phase only. The proposal could not be accepted. SDI research would continue through the Bush administration into the Clinton administration. The Clinton administration would provide the greatest chances for SDI deployment. Other deteriant missile types were conceived, such as small and light smart missile providing a defensive shield from space that cost hundreds of thousand of dollars rather than millions. The greatest challenge to the ABM technology was that Soviets missile changed from liquid fuel to solid fuel causing and increased variance in speed, obsoleting missile interceptor technology. Continual adaptions in Soviet missile technology threaten the security confidence.<br /><br />The nuclear threat has not gone away. Topol M under the ABM treaty again challenges our perception of a defensive shield against an adaptive missile technology capable of confusing satelite tracking and mid flight navigational variation designed to avoid destruction by ground interceptor missiles. The need for defensive missile is as real today as in Reagan's era.<br /><br />Other personality discussed in the Book were Jeanne Kirkpatrick, Weinberger, Meese, and Baker.into a 100 percent arms reduction nor believe in negotiate from a position of weakness.

They tend to the spiritual and material needs of others, following Christ example. They heal the sick, comfort those in need of comfort, cloth the naked, cast out devils, and raise the dead. The lean on God as he strengthens them through their struggles. They provide deliverance and the message of salvation to those less fortunate then them. They continue on towards perfection and sancify their lives further. These are they that are known, as \\"Saviors on Mount Zion\\". They act as an intermediary between God and man, as a type of Messiah. The prophet demonstrates this pattern. The prophet intercedes for the people of the world and church and pleads our case to the Lord. Joel and Alma stated we must all become prophets and be capable of prophesying of all things. The reason for this counsel is that Christ Servants are empowered as a type of Messiah and have the power to act accordingly.<br />4. The promises of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are realized and sealed through the spirit and power of Elijah in Holy Temples of the Lord.<br />5. God Servants act as a type of King David. They maintain the covenant and provide protection to God's people. The rebuke the curses of plagues, starvation, and death. The servants of God call upon divine protection. Just as the Lord provided divine protection against the Egyptians as they fled from bondage, so will God protect his people in our day.<br />6. Christ appears directly to his servants and ministers to them. Christ instructs them directly and communicates as one man speaks and reasons to another.<br />7. Gileadi Quote: As Christ's servants become more like Christ, by learning to love and serve others, he blesses them with the same eternal blessings and promised lands, thrones and dominions, and so forth as persons in the past. End Quote<br />8. Jesus said the \\"Meek would inherit the earth\\", these are the servants of God, as celestial beings they inherit the celestial earth. The earth will become a great urim and thummin and the glory of God will reside on the earth. Those who have received their exaltation will receive an inheritance on the earth.<br /><br />Isaiah Decoded<br />The pattern for traversing the ladder to heavan<br /><br />Ruin and Rebirth (ch 1-5;34-35)<br />Rebellion and Compliance (ch 6-8; 36-40)<br />Punishment and Deliverance (ch 9-12; 41-46)<br />Humilation and Exaltation (ch 13-23;46-47)<br />Suffering and Salvation (ch 24-27; 48-54)<br />Disloyalty and Loyalty (ch 28-31; 55-59)<br />Disinheritance and Inheritance (ch 32-33; 60-66)<br /><br />Gileadi Quote:<br />Isaiah's ladder accommodates every class of character, from the noblest to the basest and as on Jacob's ladder, the God of Israel-the creator of heavan and earth-stands at the top. The only way to experience \\"salvation\\" and \\"exaltation\\" is the meet the requirements. God asks each of us to love and be loved, to give and to receive, to reach out and be reached. Isaiah's ladder to heaven is a ministering model that embraces everyone, in which each of us discovers he or she is important.<br />End Quote<br /><br />Hezekiah foreshadows our day<br /><br />Hezekiah is a type of savior. Hezekiah interceded for his people providing \\"salvation\\" from the Assyrian forces of Sennacherib. You may recall, the Lord told Hezekiah, he would die soon, so, Hezekiah pleaded with the Lord to preserve his life. The Lord considered Hezekiah's valiancy in destroying the places of Idol Worship in Israel and restoring the covenant with House of Israel and chose too extended Hezekiah life by fifteen years through both a miracle and a sign (sun dial turned back). Isaiah counseled Hezekiah not form an alliance with Egypt because the Egyptian soldiers were men not Gods and Isaiah foresaw the Egyptian army falling to the Asyrians and the Lord would fight Israel's battles.<br /><br />Sennacherib blasphemied God and his cursing were known by God causing the wrath of God to be turned against the Asyrians and as they came to deliver the death blow to Israel, a rumor was heard among the soldiers causing them change course away from Jerusalem. The Lord sent his destroying angel to lay waste 185,000 Assyrian Soldiers. This pattern is a foreshadowing of our day. The watchmen need to wake up from their sleep and be aware where the enemy resides and his movements. The enemy will strike fast and his destructions are at a global scale that no organization can mitigate, neutralize, or alleviate the suffering. Only those who are prepared shall not fear, the great and dreadful day of the Lord.<br /><br />Gileadi Quote<br />Just as the king of Assyria attack's God's people \\"Israel\\", so he attack \\"Egypt\\". In Isaiah's end-time scenario Isaiah is also a codename. Isaiah use Egypt and Assyria as codenames for end-time world powers follows a pattern often employed by Hebrew prophets. Zechariah, for instance speaks of Egypt and Assyria as world powers God will subdue in a future day of destruction. (Zech 10:11) So they represent opposite Political and Spiritual Power Today: (Egypt verses Assyria) (Zion verse Babylon)<br /><br />When Assyria suddenly became a world threat, other nations still looked to Egypt's immense military might to defend them, trusting in alliances for protection: \\"Woe to those who do down to Egypt for help, relying on horses, putting their trust in immense numbers of chariots and vast forces of horsemen, but who do not look to the Holy One of Israel, nor inquire of the Lord!\\" ...The Egyptians are human, not divine, their heros are flesh, not spirit: when the Lord stretches out his hand, those who help them will stumble and those helped will fall; both will come to the end together...Pharaoh's protection will turn to shame, shelter in Egypt's shadow to embarrassment (Isaiah 30:3;31,3)<br /><br />However, the only nation today that fits Isaiah's description of \\"Egypt\\" is America...In future rerun of past events, we may expect to see a scenario develop like that of Isaiah's time: when Egypt's inhabitants choose evil, preferring idols and spiritually altered states; when Egypt's economy crashes and civil war sweeps the land; when Egypt's politicians take matters into their own hands and mislead the nation.

I found many of insights helpful and insightful.<br />The saints of God must turn away from false Gods, turn their hearts to the Lord, and seek out their &quot;Calling and Election&quot;.  In the last days, Christ words will be considered by some to be true and other fables.  Christ is the Messiah King providing covenant protection, exaltation, and creation and order in the Universe.  Christ servants protect the covenant people.  Prototype of Christ were: Moses, Abraham, Melchezedek, Nephi, Benjamin, Mosiah, and Joseph Smith.  Christ is the great high priest interceding for the children of the covenant bringing us back into the presence of Heavanly Father.<br />Christ's atonement, resurrection, and law giving him capability too ransom us back into grace with Heavanly Father.  Christ determines the integrity of the individual's determination to obey commandments, endure to the end, and serve; and justifies the individual worthy by pleading his case.  As King, Christ has absolute power, absolute knowledge, and absolute presence.  When the saints keep the covenant they are ensure protection. When they break the covenant they are left to their own power.<br />Avraham says Christ attempted to establish his covenant during his mortal ministry but was unable.  As a consequence of not establishing the covenant: Nero's pillage, dispora, and the holocaust occurred as the Jews were unable to stop the intruding forces of evil.  The Jews are still waiting for their King Messiah having been betrayed by many false Messiahs.<br />Christ established the New and Everlasting covenant.  Through the spirit and power of Elijah the promises of the covenant are sealed.  Father is sealed to child and child to father.  The keys of Elijah were restored to Joseph Smith.  Throught the spirit and power of Elijah, the temple have the power of salvation and exaltation.  In essence, the saints have all the saving ordanances necessary to receive their calling and election.  A foreshadowing of Zion and Zion will be established creating the Heavanly city.  The ten tribes of Israel will reunite, 144,000 high priest will be selected and receive their calling and election, and Christ will return to the earth.  The prophecies of Isaiah, Ezechial, Joel, Micah, Nephi, Jeremiah, John the Revelator will be fulfilled and the earth will be restored to its paradiscal glory.l the saving ordanances necessary to receive their calling and election.

Having vowed to make war and weapons of mass destruction obsolete, a renew humanity begins the task of healing the environment. (John Naisbitt - Megatrend 2000)<br />Here are some of the question Naisbitt raises:<br />Is the Millenium the symbolic struggle between Good verses Evil? Is the Millenium revival a metaphor of choice, where, on one hand man can destroy himself through: nuclear annihilation, bio terror, or the green house effect; and on the other hand, God destroys the wicked because of their willfull disobedience to his laws. What does it mean when we hear \\"God is Dead\\" espoused by the Greek Nietzsche philosophy of those who worship science? Are we prepared to embrace and accept both sides of human nature? Do we have to abandon our humanity too embrace science? Is the spiritual revival a quest to better our lives and our neighbors?<br /><br />In times of religious persecution, economic hard times, social change people seek to escape out of history seek millennial promises of peace and plenty.<br /><br />Science and technology do not tell us the meaning of life. One starts to rediscover the emotional side of life. There is a deep need for emotional fulfillment through religion. In tough times, people anchor down with either fundamentalism or spiritualistic experiences.<br /><br />As stronger emotional needs start surface, more advocacy of millennial doctrine will occur with rhetoric centering on themes of apocalyptic destruction and the final return and reign of Christ. The end out come will be \\"Good\\" has over \\"Evil\\".<br /><br />Fundamentalism will increase: Shinto, Islam, Protestantism, Buddhism, and Judism.<br /><br />Joseph Cambell's in his book \\"Power of Myth\\" emphasized the importance and power of myth. Myth has power and influence on human behavior. Naisbitt indicates that in time of rapid change both inner-directed, \\"trust the feeling inside\\" and out-direction, \\"authoritive doctrine\\" will increase. \\"The Battle for God\\" further supports the idea of a religious revival with a vast potential to influence media, business, and politics.<br /><br />Naisbitt observes, one Shinto priest known as the \\"miracle man of Japan\\" won 5 million members, in Japan, United States, and Brazil with 80 percent being non-Japanese. Fundamentalist Soutern Baptists have become the largest Protestant denomination. Naisbitt says, \\"The Catholic Church is reflecting the evangelical influence by tolerating a full-fledged charismatic movement that make some Southern Baptist look tame\\". In North America new religions outside of the Judeo-Christian framework are growing: Moslem, followers of Islam, Buddhism, and Korean religions.<br /><br />The fundamentalist have used media to spread their message. Religion is targeting marketing, larger architectures to congregate, music, books and generating billions of dollars in business. The religous leader broadcast taylo made messages and content which are being modeled by feedback from what the people want. Fundamental religion authoritivately spells out the answers. The New Age of Channeling seeks to use meditation, chants, and dream works to increase human intutition.<br /><br />The New Agers and Fundamentalist commonly dislike each other. \\"New Agers are tired of the tyranny of fundamental religions trying to take away the right of freedom of religion and the press,\\" says Elizabeth Burrows. Harvey Cox says, \\"a global phenomenon that has to do with the unraveling of modernity\\" and marks the end of \\"a kind of faith where science would master all our problems.\\"h inner-directed, \\"trust the feeling inside\\" and out-direction, \\"authoritive doctrine\\" will increase. \\"The Battle for God\\" further supports the idea of a religious revival with a vast potential to influence media, business, and politics.<br /><br />Naisbitt observes, one Shinto priest known as the \\"miracle man of Japan\\" won 5 million members, in Japan, United States, and Brazil with 80 percent being non-Japanese.

It was a terrible disaster.  Numerous warnings were given, but the people became hardened to the danger.  In the past, cyclic flooding in the valley had conditioned the citizens to endure nature disasters.  They just accepted it.  The danger of the dam was no different.  They learned to live with the danger.  No one really understood potential damage that could occur if the dam broke.<br />Even prior to dam breaking and even when the dam was breaking, citizens thought the warnings were a joke, humoreous, laughed at; until they saw a wall of water 40 feet high forcing dust and wind in front and saw homes rolling as debrie in the approaching monster.  They saw homes and buildings in front of the water destroyed.  Many caught refuge on top of roofs, thousands died a debrie trapped them.  Fires started burning.  The stable community was completed destroyed.<br />The owners of the lake were the Carnagies, some of the richest people in the world.  They sponsored a club of wealth patrons called the club of 100.  The wealthy club of 100 enjoyed fishing, camping, and recreationing in exclusive private lodge near the reservoir.  The club of 100 had a detailed engineering analysis was done of the dam.  The engineers recommend rebuilding or reengineering the dam reasons being:  1. lack of spill ways 2. The earthen structure needed more outlets.  The dam need to be reengineered to steel and concrete. 3. Stocking of fish prevented spill ways to be opened because they didn't want the fish to escape 4. When heavy rains hit, the spill ways were cloughed with debrie  The Carlie Steel company and railroad where thought to have the largest financial interest in fixing the dam, yet no action was taken.  The dam had stood for years and in its time was consider an engineering achievement.  20 million tons of water were pressing on the dam.

I liked his work ethic.  The ideas of love (discovering why men suffer), obedience, and zen were made in a very clean presentation.  The most impressive feat in the book was the portion where Nakamura demonstration his power by breaking river rocks.  This is no cheap trick.  The breaking represented, the complete symbolism of:  giving a 100 percent, seeking mental clarity, releasing extreme power through joining as one with the material.  The verbal discussion of zen being manifest as action.  One can reason, breaking the rock is simply the principle of the fulcrum and leverage being applied to a material through a mechanical forces. However, one must experience the physical and mental pain associated with failure to perform such a feat to understand the simplicity and perfection illustrated by Nakamura.<br />My teacher talked about breaking river rocks in the mountain.  He told me it was a matter of timing and speed.  Apparently, the his first attempts at breaking the rocks were unsuccessful and he wanted to quit.  After receiving encouragement and demonstrations that it was possible, he proceeded to break many rocks.  Also, my first attempt to breaking a 6 inch piece of ice using a full circle chop failed. I thought about power only and failed.  I turned inward focusing internally and broke the ice with a one inch slap.  People want to know what was the difference in technique.  Zen was the difference, and it produced the power needed to break the ice.  The difference in breaking quality was noticeable.  Nakamura inspired me to encourage my students to give a 100 percent at every practice.  He demonstrated katas as a means to strengthen the mind of the body.  I hope for significant improvements in concentration and desire.  Nakamura karate is very good, no wonder he became a karate legend.<br />The photos in the book create a strong connection to natural beauty of the sunsets, waterfalls, rock textures, and the whiteness of snow.

My background is Information Technology consulting, so I found I related too only a few of her stories.  I would say her stories were interesting and demonstrated how companies move through change stages arriving at fruition.  Ms Duck reminences on her experience and draws important conclusions and abstractions from her experiences.  Some of her experiences seemed familar while a larger portion were not as concrete.  I could see how large organizations profit from her holositic view of change.<br />I'm sure her wisdom should not dismissed.  I've read Jack Welch's books and reflected on the quantifiable and scientific approach to change and can see objective change can appeal rationally; however, Ms Duck seems to have produced change through insight and dramatic effects a vast range of companies and types.  She seems to have a gift for perception and insight into the inner dynamics of the people that make change happen in a company.  Duck hand holds her clients through change stages and comforts them by imparting wisdom that allows her client to see a &quot;better way&quot;.  This &quot;better way&quot; seems to have dynamic impacts on the production of the company.  Once the barriers are removed the company matures and reaches fruition.	2003-09-25

The theme protrays Michael Jordon as competitive and a tough player with a fierceless tenacity to raise the standard of basketball transforming the NBA into big business.  Michael Jordon intelligence, hard work, and vision helped him lead his team to six championships and a three repeat.  Probably one of the worst days of my life was when Michael Jordon hit a three point shot over Bryon Russell in the 1998 championship final game against the Utah Jazz.  One word imprinted on my brain, \\"No!\\" as Jordon crushed Utah's dreams of a championship.<br />The Bulls under Jackson had created the perfect weapon.  The perfect weapon being the triangle offense: Jordon, Pippen, Rodman, and the center - synergistically integrated to destroy the opponent's defense.  The perfect weapon was not easily formed and Halberstam compliments Jackson's ability to bring all the talent, personalities, and ambitions together into one focus, another championship.  Despite management irritation and desire to split the team, Jordon and Jackson managed to negotiate another season,  to stay together, one of the greatest seasons of Bulls history.  Halberstam details the struggles of Scottie Pippen and his eventual emergence as physically gifted player, the rebounding threat of Rodman, and Jordon's williness to work with Pippen creating the perfect weapon.  Jackson would saw Pippen as a critical component to a third championship but struggle to achieve control.<br />Fierceness on both ends of the court characterized Jordon with him winning both the MVP and the defensive player of the year.  Jordon was not happy unless he was winning.  The era of Michael Jordon represented increases in crowd attendence, quantum leaps in player contract pay, more spectacular moves, new emerging talent emulating Jordon, and increased media coverage.  If you love basket trivia and want to learn more about the formation of the Chicago Bulls during the Jordon era this is an excellent historical documentary.<br />Halberstam chronological spans events ,such as, Jordon's family life, his father, mother, and brother Larry; Jordon's high school years, his speed and growth; Jordon's player years at North Carolina and respect playing for Dean Smith; Jordon's leadership as he lead his team to a victory capturing the NCAA crown; Pippens defiance of management and arguements of devaluation; the strange behavior of Rodman and his importance as a rebounder;  The championship defeat of the raining kings, Los Angles Lakers, and the fustration expressed by Magic Johnson;  Jordon's first championship, his joy and relief of winning a championship;  the battle, defeat, and conquer of the NY Nicks; and Jordon's retirement.<br />One of the rare portions of the documentary is Halberstam's insight into Michael Jordon's intelligence, such as, the secret weapon to build strength without increasing significant mass creating a stronger Bulls team.  Jordon knew strength was necessary because the game of basketball was become more physical.  The strength training payed off as Jordon was able to finish shots after being hit.<br />Halberstams work represents a change in American culture as basketball came onto center stage.

The supreme court ruling in Brown v Board of Education starts the paving of the road against segregation. The struggle would not be easy as young black activist wanted more rights, rights not popular among the white community, right such as, to eat with caucasians, ride buses in non-segregated sections, attend movies without having to watch from the black only balcony, and vote limited by the literacy and discriminatory practices design to prevent eligibility for blacks. The movement for equal rights started slowly and was large based on Christian idealogy, \\"if they enemy strike thee on the check turn also the other cheek\\". Black religious leaders would draw from simple fundamental teachings of Christ and Ghandi about non-violent philosophy to encourage the black community to resist violence to achieve their objectives. The religious leaders could see the long term advantages to non-violent protests, knowning that militant approaches would lead to significant increases in death. The civil rights era was a time of danger, excitement, and determination. The black leaders believing the beating could not break down the spirit and they could rise above their attackers. If they were beaten down, they would be replaced, and show their undominatable determination.<br /><br />As the movement grew diverse idealogies emerged leaving some of the black leaders disoriented about the groups commitment to non-violence. The first trumiphant event breaking the barrier of segration came as political pressure mounted against Mayor Ben West who commit to stop segregation and allow blacks and whites to eat together. James Bevel who involved both the older black generation who feared and submitted completely the white man and the children in protest marches. Halberstam seemed to believe this was the turning point for the movement as the older generation was ready to standup against their oppressors. If even the children could make a statement the movement was gaining force. An the movement would increase in the thousands from town to town and the media would follow the marches, beatings, speechs, and the unrest of a nation in disruption. Halberstams book of over 700 pages demostrates the amazing interest the media acquired while centering on the social changes threatening to break the social imperatives of the time. The intensity and interest was amazing.<br /><br />The movement was to remain disciplined, non-violent, and legal. Individuals not willing to commit to the principles and practices of non-violence were not allowed to participate. Mr Luther King would not march against a court injunction until his lawyers cleared the injunction. The goal was non-violent protests. The struggle to gain Federal protection for the freedom riders did not come immediately. The freedom riders brought local law confrontation and klan involvement into the picture. Robert Kennedy right hand man a federal agent would be badly beaten. The battle lines were emerging between the Klan and the Federal government. Violence, death, and brutality characterized the protests of the freedom riders highlighted withnumerous encounters with Bull Conner, a known member of the Klan, and general racist corruption controlling the police force. Halberstam struggles with explaining the issues preventing the Federal government from early involvement in civil right violations. Its seems the south even after a 100 years of emancipation struggled with the after effects of slavery. The social imperatives had not been redefined and the government seemed perplexed on how to influence change. The civil war had been won by the North but the idealogy remained very Southern. However, Dr. King would visionalize a future where the idealogy of the south and the world would be more tolerate and accepting of the black culture. The price to gain this freedom would require the deepest commitment from all of the black culture. Analogies to Dr. King being the Mose to liberate his people were often used to rally the black communities to action.<br /><br />Dr King would become the figure head for the media to focus on. Dr King role in increasing black rights would be recognized by the black community. However, some would not feel so supportive and desire leaders by John Lewis to play a more promient role. The fundamentalism deriving the equal rights movement crowned in the confrontation between black activist and the white klan police force at Selma. The violence is appalling as Halberstam paints a picture of hugh waves of militant officers beating and club innocent men, women, and children in the act of prayer. This is an extremely painful depiction of suffering and determination. Dr King would attempt to rally support in Chicago but find a different culture and challenges. Dr Kings assassination was a sad moment in American History.

The author, Nathan Johnson is an eloquent writer. The book is written in a narrative that provides detailed historical lineages of the most popular martial art disciplines (Kungfu and Okinawan systems) known throughout the world. Most of the book focuses on the principles of zen. Mr Johnson, demostrates numerous katas and shows how the posture translate into arm twists, throws, and strikes. The application was not design inflict permanent injury rather control. Control rather than injury seems to build his case for the actual intrepretation and purpose of the martial art system. He effectively defends his intrepretations of these kata with philosophical discussions about their historical origins, religious buddist intent, and zen application. It is clear that Mr Johnson believes that spiritual and moral development is the core belief of the Shaolin Martial Art system teachings. He convinces the reader of this fact by dedicating a chapter to discussing why the shaolin martial art system was not a system of combat. Mr. Johnson demostration of pushing hands conveys the message, the tao is the middle way, \\"not agressive and not passive.\\" The hand transformations where used to understand how to blend with resistence or force, neutralize it, and return it to the sender. The book is about the desire of enlightenment, kindness, and hard work and how to achieve lasting meaning in the study of the martial art system.	2002-12-06

Leaders from the most profitable businesses don't need to inflate their emotional competencies ratings because the people supporting and working for them will provide an accurate rating. Visionary leaders paint a larger picture illustrating the purpose for the organization. Visionary leaders have the ability to increase corporate focus and enthusiam. The leader is the focal point of the organization. Everyone looks to the leader during a crisis. Leaders who are empathic and understanding impact people both personally and professionally. Workers measure their performance based on expectations and feedback provided by their leaders. The book \\"Primal Leadership\\" describes a perception and behavioral model for to help leaders change behavior and significantly improve their organizations.<br />\\"Primal Leadership\\" attempts to gain the readers focus by illustrating a new leadership model, a leadership model centered on emotional perception where increased trust is transferred to the leader through iterative improvement. Elements to the model are ideal self, realistic self, planning agenda, and behavior modification. The authors authors original emotional competencies remain: Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness, and Relationship Management with these competencies helped us measure the quality of leader, but does not necessary describe how to improve a leader. \\"Primal Leadership\\" goes to the next step by providing an leadership model designed to strengthen an leader by empowering for greater impact through greater levels of trust. The organization improves as the result of leadership improvement.<br /><br />The leader looks first at the ideal condition. \\"Describe what you want to be doing in fifteen years\\". The ideal condition describes the future and drops the barriers of reject and fear. The interesting observation is that 80 percent of the ideal has nothing to do with work. The ideal condition feeds into planned agenda. The planned agenda conceptualizes a course of action to achieve the ideal.<br />The ideal self plans for and builds the future of the company. Without an vision new product lines and service centers would not likely be created. The ideal self has the potential to energize the company.<br /><br />The realistic self narrows the focus to the leaders strengths. Diversity is the enemy with increased product and service not leading to increased profits. Diversity is often viewed as method to improve profit, but more often a long term drain on the company. The key is to narrow the range of products and services to those where the strongest core competencies exist. The realistic self helps center the leader back to the areas where clients are willing to pay the most money. The realistic self keeps the company from engaging in activities that lose money.<br /><br />Faith, hard work, and practice facilitate behavior modification. The paradim \\"You can't teaching a old dog new tricks\\" is not true. Leaders are expected to improve behavior.

Embu is extremely efficient way of teaching students how to apply their skills in actual combat while avoiding the contentiousness nature of sparring.  Sparring is not the traditional method for teaching martial arts.  The purpose of sparring to teach speed, distance, rythm, and timing.  However, the end results of sparring while not create the desired quality and deep understanding of the art.<br />Anciently, the fighting monks practiced kempo to improve personal security against bandits.  It is very doubtful these monks would have engaged in actual fighting to practice the martial art.  Monks regarded injury to an another human being as unacceptable.  Often after a real confrontation, they would administer relief to the injuried attackers, when possible.  The monks sought peace and esteemed themselves as pacifist.  So, how did they obtain fighting skills second to none?<br />The monks practiced kempo using the philosophy called embu.  Embu in Japanese means &quot;Martial exercise.&quot;  The first Embu method has two partner moving simulateously, without any prearrange techniques.  They move softly and slowly maintaining safety.  The one punch pull is required to avoid contact and serious injury.  The flow between defense and offense is expressed during the exercise.  To the viewer, it seems like the practitioners are engaged in a dance: weaving, entering, blocking, and striking.  The use of hand and foot skills is encouraged.  As the skill levels increase, vitals areas become the pin point targets.  Embu should appear effortless and direct.<br />The second embu method requires coreograph or a set of moves to be practiced.  A group of four students work together with one student defending against the other three.  Each student has a set of moves to perform, whether it be an attack or an defense.  As students masters the old movements they can begin to create new movements.  The new movements usually are created after a few years of study with the teacher.  At first the student learns how to perform each movement.  The movements are practice slowly at first, and the speed increased as their skill improves.  Eventually, the practice increases in speed and power.  The attacking students measure their response after each defense technique is performed by the defending student.  The flow of motion can increase in speed and power until it closely approximates real combative environments.  The one inch pull punch or kick is encouraged, to avoid serious injury, and allow for continueous training.  If injury starts to occur during training, students are required to examine levels of control, slow the techniques down, and apply an softer application of the technique.<br />Eventually, the subtle mysteries of the technique are revealed, and as the student reflects on the technique a vast range of application are realized: joint turns, throws, cavity presses, blocks, strikes can be seen in the technique.  Additionally, the use of chi and mental focus changes the techniques consequences.  Kempo real power is understanding vital points and how mental focus increase the effectiveness of the strikes and block.  The most powerful material breakers are often practitioners of kempo.  Softer and more penetrating potential is realized by the defending student.  The student begins to visual the physical consequences resulting from each techniques.  The degree of reflection depends on the understanding of the student and their perspectiviness.  Students are required to reflect on their practice and work together to improve each others perfection.<br />Kempo techniques are expanded to use grappling.  Anciently and modernly, Chin na expresses itself within the philosophy of kempo.  Throws, chokes, joint locks put the receiver down.  Finishing strikes can be apply allowing the practitioner to clear the oppponent before moving to the next attacker.<br />During practice Kempo trains against a vast variety of weapons: knives, clubs, staff, sword, and hand to hand.  Embu philosophy still applies regardless of the attack pattern and type.  The goal is to blend and work harmously and effortless against a wide range of spacial patterns.  Position, speed, power, and feel are developed during practice.<br />Embu does not encourage aggression.  It allows realistic self-defense training.  The result is a stronger feeling of calmness and control by the student.  More importantly it enourages cooperation and control through a heighten sense of awareness.  Movement can flow from one attacker to another, awareness of how space can be occuppied is anticipated.  Vulnerabilities become traps with counters, locks, and strikes responding.

The knowledge worker produces magnitudes of scale more value to any organization.  A knowledge worker represents the &quot;Brains&quot; of an organization.  They know how to setup company infrastructure, keep it going, and improve upon its structure.<br />Capital is not as important as knowledge.  Capital by itself does not create wealth, innovation, or increases to productivity. Knowledge produces ideas, innovations, efficiency, and productivity.<br />A knowledge worker can create a idea without capital, knowledge is brain power.  Once the idea is realized, funders provide capital floods transforming the idea into process or product.  Knowlege provides an incredible economic company potential.  Remove the knowledge worker and growth stops, systems and processes stagnate.  Reduce the number of service workers and operations become more efficient.  Historically, as service workers number decrease their tasks and output have increased proportionate to their numbers.  Basically, the service worker were expected to &quot;Do More with less&quot;.<br />Knowledge represents the whole expertise in domains of finance, information, policy, management, etc..  The knowledge worker generates the &quot;Ideas&quot;.  Ideas are transformed into processes and systems.  Its principles of creativity and credibility which provides trust in the idea.  Drucker concludes that knowledge itself is profitable.  In the post capitalistic society knowledge produces wealth.  Knowledge increase productivity.  The sum of knowledge in a domain increases productivity and growth exponentially.  Its this radically breakaway phenomenia which knowledge produces providing wealth and growth to an organization.	2002-10-04

In the first part of the book, Business philopher, Peter Drucker protrays and verbally the business model of today, and highlights the necessary interactions of managers with the model. In the second part of the book, Drucker breaks away and reveals a series of startling revelations about today's business.<br />The theory of business is what Drucker, defines as \\"what a company gets paid for.\\" Drucker states when big companies get in trouble they blame \\"complacency, arrogance, mammoth bureacracies\\", as a plausible explanations. However, the problem's root causes are rarely identified and the prevously stated explanations are rarely right. Most companies fail, to perform well, at what they get paid for.<br /><br />Drucker defines the parts of the business environment, as: environment (society and its structure and the market), mission (customer ), (core competencies) and technology. Why is this important? The assumptions about environment, mission, and core competencies must fit together. Drucker drives home the point by contrasting the sucess of non-profit organizations with profit organizations, stating we can learn from the success of non-profit organizations, namely: well define mission, lack of deep management hierarchy, individual responsiblity, a deep understand of individual roles and purposes, and cohension between expectations and results. Secondly, the theory of business must be known and understood through out the business. Drucker stresses the importance of learning from the non-customer. And Lastly, the theory of business must be tested constantly.<br /><br />The Effective Decision process involves the follow sequence of steps: 1. Classify the problem 2. Define the problem 3. Specify the answer to the problem 4. Decide what is right rather than what is acceptable 5. Build into the decision the action to carry it out 6. and test the validity and effectiviness of the decision against the actual course of events. This is an high level sketch outlining a model for effective decision.<br /><br />Drucker provides two methods, to help make, people decisions. The two creative approaches are: determine if the right people has right qualifications, perceptions, and talents; and make sure the individual understands the job. The first approaches advocates careful selection of the individual, by determining, how well the candidate fits the job assignment. The second approach measures the new manager's understanding of the job. The process requests, the new manager to write on paper, what they think will make them sucessful, in their job. Senior management reads the paper to determine, if the manager has grasped an understanding, of the job, and revalidates their decison about the individual being the right person, for the job.<br /><br />The discipline of innovation encourages managers to separate the reasons for successful management, into two groups: systematic and non-systematic innovation. Both systematic and Non-systematic opportunies exist within an company or industry because of unexpected occurences, incongruties, process needs, and industry and market changes. Systematic innovation begins by analyizing the sources of opportunity. Innovation is perceptual and conceptual by definition and innovators must go out look, ask, and listen. Effective innovations start small. Small Innovations can lead to large implementations. Without innovation the company will go out of business. Innovation keeps a company competitive in the market and capable of meeting customer needs.<br /><br />Technology has created a great diversity of information. In order for a manager, to be effective, managers need to identify the information they need to effective perform their jobs.<br /><br />The world is moving to a society of organizations. Companies are moving to global economies of scale. People interact with various organizations to achieve results. Because of this new organization theory, outsourcing is preferred when no direct management hierarchy exists to a Vice President. Outsourcing provides high skill specialist, management, and senior management. Companies are achieving better results organizationally by outsourcing business process where possible.<br /><br />Management is responsible for creating the knowledge worker. Historically, significant increasing in productivity were the result of a management core build established. Management is responsible for building the skilled worker. Organizations are made up of individuals, who have a high degree of technical skill and knowledge. Information must be convert into knowledge and manager's communication ability dictates the level of effectiviness in using the skilled worker's knowledge. Organizations represent a network of specialists, rather than a strong command and control heirarchy. However, technology of itself does not increase productivity.<br /><br />How do managers increase productivity? Managers increase productive by helping the knowledge worker to work smarter - not harder. Management creates the knowledge worker by empower them with specialized skills and knowledge. Productivity gaps are closed through training. Management must decide who gets trained. Training the right people increase the worker's capability, compensation, and productivity. Performance can only be achieved by the worker working smarter not harder. Only ten percent of the work is effectively and producing ninety percent of the productivity and profit. Thus, over ninety percent of the work is ineffective. It is management's responsibility to reduce this inefficiency. Drucker will later introduce his activity oriented decision model to help managers reduce the amount of inefficiency.<br /><br />Managers are responsible for creating and maintaining their carreer path. Receiving a higher education degree and employment, in a large company does not guarentee retirement, with the company. Managers are responsible for designing and maintaining their career. Fragmentation of purpose and thought must be overcome to reduce confusion and losses. Knowledge workers must learn how to produce. This requires the knowledge work to remain current, with changes, in the business environment. Their contribution in large part depends on the knowledge workers ability to adapt and learn smarter ways to produce.<br /><br />Activity Oriented Decision model prevents loses and failures. Activity Oriented decisions combine value analysis, risk analysis, quality analysis, and process analysis, into one. Decisions resulting from managers who follow the activity oriented decision model don't risk losing capital. The combination of the various information sources, associated with the activity oriented decision helps the manager understand the potential value of the venture, the potential value, the risks of failure, and the cost of modifying or implement new processes, and the long term affects on quality in the organization.<br /><br />The activity oriented decision model is a conceptually definition and the practical discipline proposed exciting possiblities. Activies are analyzed, defined, and sequenced. Resources are allocated to the activity. The activity outcomes are measured to determine, if they are meeting requirements. Managers weight the risks by asking \\"what are the benefits of the activity?\\",\\"What are the fallout impacts for failure to implement the activity?\\", and \\"what are the impacts to the organization long term by implementing the activity?\\"<br /><br />Analysis of the process, results in time and budget allocation estimates. Schedules provide time lines and sequences linked to a resources. Managers must coordination various organizations to gain access to a resource. A resource represents a individual in a specialize field of knowledge. Communication and coordination are necessary to effectively manage various resources, so each individual understands, what is expected andwhat to produce. Budgets and time provide the boundary of the activity problem. Its possible to have a budget or schedule which exceeds the boundary of the problem, making the activity unfeasible. To avoid this problem, the manager must provide clear objectives to be developed and maintained. The objectives scope must stay within a predefined problem boundary.sponsible for designing and maintaining their career.

Achieving maximum learning requires freedom.  The author states learning is maximized by taking on a 1000 internships, active participation in the community, and periods of isolated reflection.   The principles of democracy are essential in education.  A broad range of freedom needs to given to the student to explore ideas.  Internship implies sharing information and knowledge with a potential employee, aimed at increasing their professional capability, before employment.  Learning is increased as knowledge is put into action.  Servicing and learning are tightly integrated and provide purpose to the learning.   Service is the key to creating a connectedness with the community.  Periods of isolated reflection allow the student to meditate on the principles and information they have learned.  Abstraction, synthesis, and integration mental process allow the information to evolve into other ideas or principles.   Think of the sculpture of the thinking man, deeply focused in thought, reflecting and studying what he knew, sitting on a rock in isolation.<br />The author makes the follow observations. 1. Schools are networks not communities.  2.  Our kids are taught to anonymous 3. Its better to lie or partial lie to avoid being caught 4. Telling the truth or reporting wrong doings is wrong  5.  Schools claim social engineering values such as providing a better environment for the poor.   Social advantages such as: food, shelter, medical, and recreation 5. The education system values: competition, intimidation, and control more than principles of democracy. 6.  Students are taught \\"more is better.\\"  More money creates more happiness. 7.  Kids are taught to network, making contacts with individuals in the network, and keeping information exclusive.  8. Many of the social problems of teen pregancy, drugs, and violence are associated with the rich rather than the poor.  9. The system often mis-diagnose the smart kids as dumb.  Time in the class is often filled with tests and verbal reading.<br />The sad truth is school values translate into individual values.  If your child thinks its ok, to spend hours down in their room listening to their music, refusing to eat at the dinner table, or participate in family activities, you start to wonder.  If your child spend countless hours in homework and very little time interacting with the family, you wonder.  If your child is brilliant and you watch her struggle with grades, you wonder. If your child was previously curious about things and often worked on individual projects and research but suddenly stop, you wonder.  If you go for periods of time without noticing your child, you wonder.  We are becoming a society of individuals, networked, without identity, and without value to the community.  This is very distrubting.<br />Discontent is good.  Discontent creates change.  Change is healthy.  The machinery of public education needs reinvention.  This book is helpful step in helping people to think about 1. why change is necessary 2. why more parential involvement with the childrens education is needed 3. and why the current education system has fail us.	2002-08-23

There is a very personal and intimate feeling associated with contents of the book as the reader understands life experiences of the young boy Billy. One chapter in particular deeply impressed me, chapter 9. In chapter 9, Billy is posed against a coon caught in an old sycamore located at the bottoms, below his house.<br />The time period was the depression and Billy is lucky to have two hounds and he values these animals as his prize and joy. Billy would learned first hand the power and responsiblity he weild with this animals. The depravation of the depression had not prevent this boy from experience life. Billy's grandfather meets with Billy while is chopping down the old sycamore tree. The grandfather thinks it will be good for the boy to chop the tree down, telling him to finish the job he has started. A delimma arose after the grandfather told Billy, his mother had prepared chicken and dumplings for supper, and they would need to leave soon. Billy didn't want to miss supper nor did he want the coon to get away. A compromise was worked out as the grandfather showed Billy how to be build a scarecrow, to keep the coon in the tree, while they ate supper. The next day Billy woke up, to find only little anne begging for his attention. He realized that old dan was not around and was probably down at the scyamore tree corning the coon. Old dan responded to Billy's call and he scolded little anne for not being as faithful as old dan. Once, he realized a larger and smaller bed in the leaves near the tree, he was convinced his two hounds were the best. He was very confident in the quality of his animals.<br /><br />Billy felt bad about chopping the old tree down. However, Billy's desire to catch the coon was as strong, as the natural instincts of his dogs. Billy chopped all day until his hands were blistered. He wrapped his hands and continued to chop. Billy stopped chopping with a groove that almost went through the tree. However, it was not enough for the tree to fall. The tree was almost ready to fall. Exhausted he walked off a distance and kneeled down to pray. He prayed for help to push the tree over. This is a very powerful moment in the book. Billy didn't want to give up, but knew he had reached his limits. He sought divine help in his quest.<br /><br />Shortly after a gush of wind pushed the tree, the tree seemed to fight back, but with a burst of crackling, it fell over, and with a strong thud, hit the ground. He realized the cause and effect of the tree falling. He had destroyed the old tree to get the coon and could not what nature had provided. Billy pondered, if it was worth chopping the old tree down, to get at the coon.<br /><br />It seemed odd to Billy, how the tree fell since the other trees did not seem affected by the wind.<br />Once the tree fell, the coon escaped out of the branches. The coon put up a fight, but Billy's hounds eventually killed the coon. The blood and injuries associated with killing the coon shocked Billy. Billy picked up the dead coon by the hind legs and carried off his prize.<br /><br />Billy brought the coon home and told his father about the old sycamore tree and the wind. Billy mother said she was afraid for him when she heard the tree fall. Billy told her he was far away from the tree and it couldn't have hit him. Billy asked his father, if he thought that God had helped him push over the tree. His father told Billy he would have to decide for himself. Billy maked his decision. I found the story to be about a young boy becoming a man. His father, mother, and grandfather watched and understood Billy's transformation and were pleased with the values this young man discovered.. Billy on the other hand learn some of the harsh realities of life.However, it was not enough for the tree to fall. The tree was almost ready to fall.

The storie sources came from friends, associates, and research cases.<br /><br />I disliked the conclusions drawn from the stories suggesting confidence in cause and effect of EQ results.<br /><br />I liked what Dr Goleman was advocating about the importance of people skills: social radar, arts of influence, and collaboration and teams.<br /><br />I disliked lack of detail methodology to achieve the desired results. I felt there was too much contrast between IQ verse EQ. The book provides a strong case argument for an investment in Emotional Intelligent.<br /><br />One shocking point the author makes early in the book, states that the top 1 percent of the Emotionally Intelligent in the IT field are 1200 percent more productive. I would have liked to read more cases studies about these observations and conclusions for his study. That statement alone sparked a ton of curiousity about EQ. I'm very interested in learning how effective IT managers are in accessing the emotional needs of their employees and customers and how to implement EQ to improve performance.<br /><br />I disliked the lack of practical application. There was a disconnect between converting ideas of EQ into action. I felt the book focused too much on the principles of EQ, rather than the practical application of EQ.

Top company leaders recognize the six sigma is synonymous with constant reinvention of their business and gain success through sustained customer satisfication both internally and externally. Six Sigma business are held the highest standards of 3.4 defects per million opportunities. The belief that tool usage used for measuring results should be easy and simple. The silo-breaking effort produces strong communication and collaboration throughout the company. Core competence is improved as the company makes a strong commitment to learning and training as the standard. The six sigma way involves increase expense for training, resource, and employee time allocation; but numerous case studies suggest the end result is increase productivity. Increased productivity can apply effectively to both service and manufacturing businesses.<br />What is six sigma? 1. A focus on the customer 2. Fact based management style 3. Process focus and improvement 4. Proactive management 5. Boundaryless Collaboration 6. The drive for perfection but tolerance of failure 7. 3.4 defects per million opportunities performance standard.<br /><br />What is the improvement Cycle? DMAIC (define,measure, analyze, improve, and control) 1. Identify the problem and define requirements 2. Redefine the problem and measure key steps 3. Analyze the root causes of the problem 4. Develop improvement ideas to remove root causes and create standards of performance measurement. 5. Establish control measures to maintain performance and correct problems as needed.<br /><br />How does a company determine whether six sigma is right for them? The authors expand that six sigma is a company cultural change. Case studies indicate the change can be profitable but requires tremendous commitment, resources, and time to implement effectively. The authors assess readiness with three questions: 1. Is change a critical business need now 2. Can the company come up with a strong rationale for applying six sigma to their business 3. Will the existing improving systems be capable of achieving the change needed. A deeper understanding of what six sigma can do for the organization is requested. Scope analysis answers the question of what is feasible in terms of resources, attention, and acceptance. A timeframe analysis answers the question of how long will management be willing to wait for results.<br /><br />Where to go from here. 1. Develop a strong rationale supporting six sigma methodology in your organization 2. Management plans and actively participates in implementation 3. Create a vision and market plan 4. Become a power advocate of the process improvement cycle 5. Set clear objectives 6. Hold yourself and others accountable 7. Demand solid measurements of progress and results 8. Communicate results and setbacks to the organization. 9. Organize roles (black belts, green belts, and master black belts) 10. Select the project with the biggest impact on the organization.<br /><br />In short, The six sigma way is a big improvement over Total Quality Managment. It signifies a much higher standard of quality and connects management closer to the improvement effort. A ranking structure of black belts and master black belts brings the best expertise to facilitate improvement in the project. Accountablity and communication increase learning, cooperation, and leverage creativity and focus, in the problem solving stages. Because management is actively participating training, resources, and individual talent is effectively configured.

Its better to be a pioneer and lead from the front. The goal is to arrive with the stuff customers want, first.<br />\\"Competition for the future is competition to create and dominate emerging opportunities, to stake out new competitive space.\\" Today's company's future depends, on its ability to achieve intellectual leadership, by identifying a solid view point of the future.<br /><br />Next migration paths of developments must be managed transforming todays processes into tommorows processes.<br /><br />Finally, by developing for the future the company position themselves among is peers, first in the market. By arriving first, the company has time to build infra-structure, to maintain dominance in the space. A high level blue print called a strategic plan allows the company define their view point of the future.<br /><br />Here are three questions to help build the best assumptions necessary to build the future:<br />What type of customer benefits should the company seek in 5, 10, 15 years?<br />What competencies will we need to build or acquire in order to offer these benefits to the customer?<br />How will we need to reconfigure the customer interface over the next several years.<br /><br />Each healthy company must have a commitment to the future. Senior management must actively review strategic projects and be involved in resource allocation. This means the best talent is assigned to solve the problems of tommorow. Senior manage must have a point view of what type of people will feel comfortable while designing and building the future company. The process of getting to the future is one of successive approximation. All the knowledge and experience learned of the team is used to understand the gained opportunity. The knowledge and experience is embodied in the successive approximation. One does not have to be a big risk taker to get to the future first. Talent must be capable of learning faster than the competition. The cost of learning must remain low. Additionally, as new opportunities are understood they must be gained. Company foresight and investment must remain equal. As new discoveries are understood investment is escalated, to seize the opportunity.<br /><br />A company must learn by doing. Top management must be capable of creating a sense of direction, a sense of discovery, and a sense of destiny. A sense direction means giving company talent higher purposes for their work; an clear understanding of management intent; and the feeling of enthusiam, about building the future.

I related to the concepts and stories told by the author.  A martial artist knows the commitment, skill, and dedication required to gain a Black Belt, but few really understand the essence of Zen, in their training.  The author does not try to explain all the philosophical aspects of Zen or Buddism, instead draws from his own life experiences instances of Zen.  Many of these stories are very personal and easy to relate too.  The author has a very honest and non-assumption style to his writing; rather than focusing on achievements and personal aggrandizing, he emphasizes his struggles with marriage, tournament fighting, recovery from a bankrupt school, and a brother killed in Viet Nam.  I personally found the book to be very inspiring and renewed a desire to be a leader and better example to my students and those around me.  The author effectively communicated topics of  Zen in a easy to understand concepts and stories.  A rare addition to your Marital Art Library.	2002-06-18

The book took three days to read.  The code samples were very helpful.  The content is very rigorous and academic.  Lulushi starts with a simple Forms sample.  It seemed trival, but it built my confidence. I believed the remainder of the book to be good.  The first few chapters explain the Developer 2000 environment: Navigator, Layout Wizard, Menu Editor (I need this information and found it to be valuable), and Library Editor.  I found the section on subclassing and reusable object difficult to apply.  In theory the chapters made sense, but I needed a few simple samples to understand the practical application.  About half way into the book the author really takes off: data and control blocks, frames, relationships, canvas, menus, and windows provide a good basic understanding of code development.  This was great.  I was bored.  I found the last portion of the book on triggers very enlightening.  However, I'll admit its pretty complex.  I've taken Oracle Instructed courses for Oracle Forms/Reports and I found the book was very suppliment.  I used Lulushi book to deeper insight into how code for Developer 2000.  Lulushi uses a layering effect to teach the principles of Developer 2000.  As I read further into the book, the more complex the layers became.  He didn't try to overwhelm with every detail at the beginning of the book. He demonstrated a mastery of tool and language.	2002-04-17

Getting the front seat means being the first to class.  Studying &quot;Revelation of the Restoration&quot; was my class away from class.<br />The authors provided a comprehensive study of the Doctrine and Covenants.

Each chapter has interesting stories about early leaders, saints, and pioneers.<br />There is a nice balance between doctrine and biographies of people, who were a part of Church history.  The authors research yields some very interesting stories many of which were new to me.<br />One of the most important aspects of the book is that it gets the reader to reflect on man's relationship with God.  The Doctrine and Covenants is a marvelous set of revealed scriptures.<br />It outlines the organization and name of the Church, (establishment, organization, and power of the priesthood), man's eternal potential and covenants., the establishment of Zion, building of temples, eternal marriage and family, judgement and mercy, prophets and revelation, genealogy and family research, (priesthood keys: Elijah, Elias, Mose, John the Baptist), wickness before the second coming, the call to be a missionary.

My site is David Nishimoto's Perl Page.  I've read the 'Perl by Example' book many times and find it to be one of the best written books for perl.  I like the book because it takes  the reader - concept by concept through the Perl Language.  The large  number of examples helps demonstrate how the language syntax behaves.  My  experience in teaching perl is that examples are very helpful in  understanding syntax. Once a programmer understands the Perl Language, Perl  Function modules can be created to insulate some of the complexity of the  language.  Perl's substitution, match, and translate grammers are  explained very well in the book. I valued the explainations on user defined  functions and built in functions.  The 'Perl by Example' book finishes with  a discussion of CGI and interface with the http server, also very  valueable.  The book keeps the reader enthused about learning Perl by  building from simple concepts to more advanced concepts through the  document.  I feel comfortable in recommending this book as a valuable Perl  resource.	1999-10-18

After each  chapter the student should be able to perform certain open inventor tasks.  I assign daily programming variations drived from the book.  The  accumulative effect is to have a student capable of maintain or developing  applications in Open Inventor.  The logical extension of the programming  language is to develop using SGI tools or TGS tools.  I think the Inventor  Mentor book is one of the most prized Open Inventor books on the market.  I  adhere to the book when teaching Open Inventor exclusively. The Open  Inventor book sheds a new light on the next five weeks which moves into  VRML and Java.

Students are lectured from  the material in the book, numerous examples are provided illustrating the  concepts and principles of 3D programming and opengl function calls.  I  use VRML 2.0 to demonstrating the code examples, and student can read the  opengl code  for the example.  During the Semester students use the OpenGL  programming Guide to create a 3D game.  The game uses movable cameras,  hierarchial motion, collision detection,  display lists, texture maps,  materials, lighting, and nurb surfaces.  The material is absorbed within a  5 to 10 week period.  I've tried other books like the OpenGL superbible,  but found the Opengl Programming Guide to be much more comprehensive, and  therefore more productive in the results.  The OpenGL Programming Guide is  a book to keep.

Second,  change is a matter of  focusing on pleasure and deterence from old behavior patterns is the result  of pain.  Third,  creating 10 totally positive days.  I haven't yet  accomplished this assignment, but just three days or one day in a month is  amazing.  I will be happy to share other insights, but reading the book is  really the key, to begin your self-improvement journey.	1998-10-11

Beautiful illustration of techniques ranging from traditional  stances, hand techniques.  Overlapping photography really helps understand  the actual motion, of the hand technique.  Hundreds of photographs showing  the fundamental hand, foot, and stances of traditional karate.  My  interest was sparked as I carefully studied the hand techniques, in the  book.  There are some awesome illustrations of students breaking stone,  concrete, and wood.  I liked the book, and recommend you buy it, also.	1998-08-28

Reading the &quot;Oracle8 Pl/Sql Programming&quot; book was like being in the Oracle Education course without paying $2000.  Here's why - each chapter has short narrative descriptions of the topics followed by a lab you can do.  I like the learn by experimentation approach.  Beneficial topics were: Oracle Objects, Collections, DBMS_OUTPUT, TEXT_IO, cursors, and Dynamic cursors.  I found &quot;Oracle8 PL/SQL Programming&quot; far superior to the Oracle documentation.	1998-06-17
