This review first appeared in the \\"Ephrata (PA) Review.\\" <br /> <br />Energetic animal fathers keep busy in this ode to dads' varied contributions to home and family life.  <br /> <br />Daddies cook meals, fix things, play with you at the park, teach you to ride a bike, help you when you're sick, give baths, read bedtime stories, and come when you call and are scared at night. <br /> <br />          \\"Daddies like to make things work. <br />          \\"They fix the faucets when they drip, <br />          \\"hang the pictures on the wall, <br />          \\"and help you button, tie and zip.\\" <br /> <br />The font is set so that the sentences themselves exude energy-by curving and swerving up and down, getting smaller, growing bigger. <br /> <br />Rollicking illustrations emphasize the action.  One shows Dad in the kitchen.  With one hand he's flipping eggs and ham and with the other he's helping kids prepare a salad-while also supervising two children crack eggs into a bowl.  Meanwhile, two pots cook (boil over) on back burners. <br /> <br />A nice tribute to dads who really become involved in the nitty-gritty of home and family life. <br />	2005-06-11

This review first appeared in the \\"Ephrata (PA) Review\\". <br /> <br />Dad's out of town for the day, and the dog comes downstairs dressed exactly like dad!  Mom, brother and sister experience a highly unusual day.  The dog acts like dad in many ways-\\"he woke up grouchy and demanded some grub\\"-but unlike him in others.  He chased a cat, for example. <br /> <br />Kids who like zany books will get a kick out of this silly work by two friends who were inspired to create it after realizing they had both dressed just like their dads that day. <br />	2005-06-11

This review first appeared in the \\"Ephrata (PA) Review.\\"    Real-life examples from the animal kingdom highlight the varied roles animal fathers play in their offsprings' lives.    The text is bare bones.  \\"Some daddies build you a house\\" accompanies a picture of a fish carrying seaweed in his mouth to an emerging structure.    Realistic and richly textured pastels focus on the father-offspring duos--gorillas, birds, prairie dogs, foxes, zebras, horses, and finally, a human dad and child.  The illustrator adeptly plays with light, adding depth and interest to the illustrations.    Young animal lovers will appreciate \\"The Very Best Daddy of All\\" and they can sign and give to their own best daddy the greeting card enclosed in the book.	2005-06-11

Will they end their day with the delicious fried fresh fish Dad is dreaming of? <br /> <br />Perhaps not, but lucky are those with dads like Piggy's, who take their cues from their young ones, and go with the flow.  They and their children invent their own ways of doing things together. <br /> <br />The gentle watercolor and pencil illustrations are good-natured depictions of father and son.  Daddy Pig looks relaxed in Hawaiian shirt, floppy hat and glasses.  Piggy never removes his bright yellow boots.

Pete's father must stay hidden or on the move.  Convinced that a spy network is out to get him, he freaks when helicopters pass overhead.  <br /> <br />The story is told from Pete's viewpoint, through journal entries and letters to a friend, which lends a fresh authenticity to the account. Pete's entries range from musings on the past to his daily concerns, gradually revealing how he and his father have arrived at their present homeless state and how they are extracted from it.  <br /> <br />The story is gripping, the characters believable and likeable.  American readers will be tickled by some of the Australian English and will enjoy piecing together the meanings of colloquialisms such as \\"chucking a wobbly.\\" <br />	2005-06-02

He's been down since Lipton's birthday, when extraordinary gifts for the celebrity poured in from all parts of the world and there was no time for Mr. Pip to give Frederick his gift. <br /> <br />Santat's colorful pages are alive with silly people and wacky inventions in action, and he doesn't overlook whimsical details.  When not poring over the pictures, children will feel proud that they can figure out what's wrong with Mr. Pip, even if the geniuses can't.  The story is also a gentle reminder to adults that children, like monkeys, thrive on personal attention and time with the important people in their lives. <br />	2005-06-02

Goldfish are not exactly exciting, and the boy in this story had dreamt of a different pet:  \\"One who could run and catch. Or one who could climb trees and chase strings.\\"  <br />  <br />But alas, he's received Norman, \\"a sorry-looking fish in a gunky bowl.\\"  If he takes Norman to show-and-tell, will someone want to swap with him?  No ... but soon Norman's quiet, reassuring presence is making the boy's heart flip.  He decides he wouldn't trade Norman for \\"any pet in the whole world.\\" <br /> <br />The phrase \\"Not Norman,\\" bookmarks the story, and in a clever twist it means one thing at the beginning and just the opposite at the end.  <br /> <br />In his first children's book, Jones' expressive illustrations of boy and fish accentuate the story's silly side.  He depicts Norman blowing bubbles, smiling at the boy, boogeying to his tuba playing.  The cover illustration plays with shapes-the boy's head mirrors the fishbowl's dimensions.  As the boy peers through the bowl, we can see his eyes-and a floating Norman takes the place of his mouth and nose. <br /> <br />The author is quoted on the leaf: \\"Fish are fun and funny.  Just watching them makes me laugh.\\"    She and Jones have succeeded, glug, glug, in communicating fondness for the humble goldfish.  <br />	2005-06-02

This review first appeared in the \\"Ephrata (PA) Review\\": <br />This book's cover catches (merited) attention and readers' imagination; it features a building shaped as an elephant. Lucy-constructed of nearly 1 million pieces of wood, 200 kegs of nails and 4 tons of bolts and beams-makes her home in Margate, New Jersey.  Erected in 1881, the elephant is the nation's oldest example of mimetic architecture-buildings that mimic other objects. <br /> Designed by engineer and land-developer James V. Lafferty Jr., Lucy was meant to attract potential buyers of land that Lafferty owned near the growing seaside resort of Atlantic City.  The marketing ploy paid off, hugely, and residents grew fond of the community's \\"mascot.\\"  In 1976 Lucy was designated a National Historic Landmark. <br /> Travelers have purchased gas at stations designed to look like teapots, gas cans, pagodas, even an iceberg.  They've stayed in lodgings resembling giant teepees, windmills, and ships.  They've eaten at restaurants and food stands shaped like milk bottles, dogs, watermelons, castles, roosters, and ice cream cones. <br /> This attractive book, highlighting 35 still existing mimetic structures, provides fun and facts as it explores a whimsical, little-known facet of Americana. <br />	2005-05-01

Although Hannah grows up watching the bridge go up, and exhibits ceaseless fascination for the huge structure, her father \\"always clutched her hand a little tighter and drew in his breath a little deeper whenever she peered out at the modern marvel.\\" <br /> <br />When they attend the circus, the herd of 21 elephants, Jumbo at the lead, gives Hannah an idea.  She approaches P.T. Barnum to ask to borrow the elephants, but the great showman has already thought of the idea himself. \\"Great minds think alike, little lady,\\" he tells Hannah. <br /> <br />The rest, of course, is verifiable history.  Jumbo did indeed lead the herd across the Brooklyn Bridge on May 17, 1884, putting to rest doubts about the structure's safety and strength. <br /> <br />Bildner has engineered a deft blending of fiction and fact to construct a tender story, and Pham has illuminated it in golden tones, imparting an old-fashioned feel, and warmth between the doting father and his darling Hannah. <br />	2005-05-01

[This review was first published in the \\"Ephrata (Pa.) Review.\\"] <br /> <br />The author, founding editor of \\"Dolls\\" magazine, argues that it's been women, strong entrepreneurial women, who have designed the dolls that children over the past century have loved, and continue to love.  Here she tells the stories of five of these women, along with profiles of six contemporary dollmakers. <br /> <br />The inability to find dolls to meet their own daughters' needs inspired several dollmakers. Kathe Kruse, for example, may have never designed dolls if not for her 2-year-old who, after a brother was born, asked her mother for \\"a child like yours.\\"   The lavish porcelain dolls available in Germany in the early 1900s were hardly babylike.  It took Kruse years of experimentation to find a design for a realistic baby doll.  The company she founded still produces dolls that inspire tenderness and care.  <br /> <br />Ruth Handler created Barbie only after noting how her preteen daughter and friends played for hours with paper dolls representing adult women, creating imaginary worlds for them, which Ruth viewed as the girls' rehearsal of possibilities for their own futures. <br /> <br />In each of the five bios the author emphasizes how each woman became an entrepreneur, struggling to bring her inspirations to life and breaking ground in a men's world.  These stories will appeal to doll lovers.  They will also inspire and instruct creative young women embarking on their adult lives.  <br />	2004-12-13

As Hart learns how to manage his fractious peers, Mr. Meinert sees that allowing students to create their own unique production may be more important than musical perfection. <br />  <br />    One strand of this lively story illuminates the relationship between freedom (democracy) and peace, the messy self-interested \\"lobbying\\" and eventual compromise that makes for peace-even in the sixth-grade classroom.

(I know, I know -\\"Truth is often stranger than fiction.\\")<BR> King Frick and King Frack have each inherited half the kingdom.  They build a great stone wall that slices it in two.  No one may cross the wall.  Unfortunately it divides families from their relatives-in this story, little Tamala and Abalon and parents from Grandma and cousin Peter.  The family sews together a huge balloon, attaching it to a basket outfitted with a gas burner.<BR> One night they take off in their hot-air balloon, and sail over the wall, even while soldiers below attempt to shoot them down.  They are reunited with their relatives.<BR> The story is based on the wall constructed in 1961 to divide Berlin in two.  In 1979, two East German families sewed a balloon four stories tall and sailed over the wall.  (In 1989, the wall came down.)<BR> \\"The Balloon Sailors\\" illustrates the bizarre circumstances that ideology and politics can visit upon citizens, and how some use great imagination and perseverance to overcome the barriers imposed upon them.<BR> The heart-felt illustrations evoke folktales of old, depicting simple village folk and stereotypical kings.	2004-06-19

Dr. Seuss's life story will inspire and guide those who dream of someday working in the creative arts.  Theodor Geisel had native ability, but was hardly a child wonder who bedazzled others with his artistic talent.  He did possess, however, large stocks of imagination, persistence, and optimism.  Equally importantly, he was blessed with some well-timed luck and a hugely supportive wife, Helen Palmer Geisel, who had a master's in English and would also become a published children's author.<BR> It was the winter of 1936-37, and Geisel had walked the manuscript of his children's book-\\"And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street\\"-to 27 New York publishers.  They all rejected it.  It was too different, his drawings too strange.  He was walking along Madison Avenue, heading home to burn it when an old college mate hailed him on the street.   The friend had just been hired as juvenile editor at Vanguard House, a publisher looking for the not-yet-tried.  Within hours, Geisel had met the publisher and signed a contract.<BR> Fortunately, critics loved the book. Dr. Seuss's career had been launched. It was a career that both Theodor and Helen worked tirelessly to develop and sustain over the decades.<BR> The author of this biography-one in a series titled \\"Who Wrote That?\\"-has aptly integrated Geisel's life with the world events and trends that helped shape it, including World Wars I and II, the Depression, and the Cold War.  She also explains the workings of the publishing world-again, important context.<BR> The 100-page narrative is illustrated with 19 color photos and laid out in an attractive format.  Back matter includes a chronology of the highlights of Geisel's life, lists of his works and awards, an index, and more.  This highly readable biography will acquaint children with a beloved author.	2004-06-19

It is set during the Ottoman Empire's brief Tulip Period-a golden age-in the early 1700s.<br /> Croutier possesses excellent credentials for interpreting Turkey's cultural history for young readers.   Raised in Turkey, she has written two novels (adult level) set in that country, as well as the non-fictional \\"Harem: The World Behind the Veil.\\"<br /> In \\"Leyla,\\" the protagonist spends her early years in the Caucasus, learning to paint from her artist-father and to garden from her mother.   When war broke out between Russia and the Ottoman Empire, Leyla's father was mustered into the army and is now assumed missing.  Leyla believes she will keep her mother and three siblings from starving by selling herself to men claiming they'll find her a wealthy husband-in far-off Istanbul.<br /> Leyla soon learns she has been sold into slavery; she is eventually purchased to become part of the sultan's harem.  At the sumptuous Topkapi Palace, she is assigned to work in the flower gardens. <br /> The ending is marred by an incredulous array of serendipitous happenings.   A handsome, young prince befriends Leyla and arranges for her to teach art. During the Tulip Festival, she wins the sultan's favor as well as a hefty prize for her green thumb.  Then she learns her father is alive and working in the palace!  And much more!<br /> Despite this, the story is engaging and does provide a good picture of life in a harem, where women are physically protected, even pampered, yet deprived of basic freedoms and subject to the jealousies and intrigues of a highly politicized setting.	2004-06-19

He cries inconsolably for two whole days, and cannot even eat the favorite supper Mom prepares for him.  He and Mom plant a rosebush with orange flowers at the burial site, and the boy sits by it after school and tries to talk with Charlie.  Listen as hard as he may, however, there is no reply.<br /> When the vet calls to ask if Victor would provide a home for Shelley, a brand-new tortoiseshell kitten, he is hesitant.  Perhaps he won't like the kitten, or the kitten won't like him.<br /> Victor brings home the multi-colored bundle of fur, and gradually adjusts to her ways, which often differ from Charlie's.  She does not like to be scratched between the ears while she eats, as Charlie did.  She prefers the windowsill to the special pillow on Victor's bed where Charlie used to sleep.<BR> <BR>Soon, however, Victor begins to delight in Shelley's unique behaviors-how she plays with the water while he brushes his teeth and how she chases her own tail.<br />Himler's pencil-and-watercolors capture Victor's full range of emotion-concern and worry, grief, amusement, and joy--in this book that demonstrates how the human heart can have many rooms.	2004-05-25
