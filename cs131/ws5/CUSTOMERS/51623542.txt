I bought this at a used book store for a buck; and that goes to show that you get what you pay for. I, too, went through the book with a red pen and edited the misspellings, fractured usage and ambiguous sentences.

Liam Clancy still has legions of fans around the world, and his fans have been waiting anxiously for this book. It is, in a word, delightful. He takes us through the landscape of his birthplace of Carrick-on-Suir in County Tipperary to the early days of the sixties in Greenwich Village. Along the way we watch a metamorphosis occur: from the shy baby of a large, loving and musical family, to an experienced stage actor who revels in all the temptations of the body and soul. What struck me about his story is that he does not pull punches nor does he excuse or whitewash his experiences and antics. You are there as he drinks too much, picks up women, and goes from one adventure to another. The story is plainly told, yet Clancy's ear for poetry comes shining through his prose in a most heart-warming and deightful way.<br />The only complaint I have about the book is that is seems to stop rather abruptly. It almost seemed at the end of the book that Clancy was busily trying to cram in as many names as he could (managers, restaurant owners, fellow entertainers etc.) and neglected to actually wind up the narrative. I'm hoping this is Volume One in a series; we at least would like to know what happened to him from the middle sixties to the present. <br />If you are a Clancy Brothers &amp; Tommy Makem fan, I heartily recommend this book.	2002-02-26

A famously private individual, he opens up his heart and mind to the reader in this hiliarious &quot;memoir&quot; of growing up in Minnesota in 1956.  It's rare for me to break into LOUD guffaws while I'm reading something, but this book had me giggling and chortling and wheezing every other page. Just Keillor's description of fourteen-year-old Gary is worth the price of the book: a tree-frog boy with Herkimer hair and high-water pants..... What more can you say? <br />Anything Garrison Keillor writes is genius, in my opinion. This may be his best work yet. I highly recommend it.	2001-10-30

It's taken me 21 years to finally get around to reading &quot;Bellefleur&quot; and it's classic Joyce Carol Oates... I must say that it wasn't one of the fastest reads chiefly because I was flummoxed from page one by the chronology. Because the characters in the family tree didn't have birthdates or death dates should've been my first clue. I find it unsettling when I don't have a frame of reference for the TIME involved in a story. At first I thought Leah and Gideon were living in the early 'teens of the last century. Then it would appear that no wait --- it must be the 30's, whoops, now it's the 50's, now back to the 20's and so on. That was extremely frustrating for me, and when I finally finished the book I almost had to conclude that the entire story took place in Bromwell Bellefleur's parallel universe. <br />All this left me with a real uneasy sense of a colossal &quot;HUH???&quot; Although the prose was beautiful and the imagery was striking, I felt a bit of a sense of let-down when I couldn't figure out the basic theory of time in this novel.<br />So -- what did I miss?	2001-10-30

I've been a King fan for 25 years but always felt that the Dark Tower/multiverse stuff was not up my alley. Boy. Was I wrong. I have since devoured all Dark Tower stories, Eyes of the Dragon, The Talisman and now Black House. <br />It's probably one of King's/Straub's very best. The opening narrative was a little rattling at first, but once I caught the cadence, I can't think of a better way to start the sketch which quickly becomes the most colorful, interesting, page-turning tapestry yet. Jack Sawyer as an adult is completely plausible, and what I liked most about this story is that the COPS, the law, the AUTHORITIES are right in the middle of the conflict. So often in horror or mystery stories, the authorities are seen as cynical disbelievers or bumblers and it's up to an intrepid gang of amateurs to solve the case. Not so here. Balancing a very real and very mortal serial killer with the dark forces of the Crimson King is brilliant. I think it ties in the Dark Tower worlds with ours beautifully.<br />In short, this is going to be one of my top three favorite King novels and I highly recommend it to anyone. There are ghastly and repulsive passages dealing with the Fisherman, but beyond that, I found the novel absolutely impossible to put down.	2001-09-19

Once I got past King's effusive praise and guarantee that I would &quot;never read a book like this. Never.&quot; I became totally hooked on Don Robertson. This book really IS like nothing I've ever read. His characters are dowdy and dumpy and troubled and fat and maybe not the most dazzlingly brilliant people you could read about, but who wants to do that? <br />This book stayed in the back of my mind for months. I started reading all of Robertson's books in order, and while they differ widely in plot, setting, point of view etc., his basic techinique is usually there: there are good people and bad people and the good people suffer but the bad people get theirs in the end. Robertson writes a morality play but because he doesn't make his good people TOO virtuous, you are always surprised by what happens. The conclusion to The Ideal, Genuine Man was completely believable and true to life, although certainly extremely unsettling.<br /> In short, I can't say enough about this brilliant and talented man, and I must wonder as well: why are these books out of print? You can still get copies of A Confederacy of Dunces and Catcher in the Rye. Don Robertson's work should be required reading in all Freshman Lit. classes! <br />P.S. I loathe having to read a 40 year old library book with 40 year old drips and stains and suspicious blots on them. Ick.	2000-12-13

This novel is a  real change from his Montana based stories, and I was skeptical at first. I  wondered how he could place himself within an eleven year old boy who comes  from Boston.... but I need not have worried for long. As usual, this is a  beautifully written, lyrical piece that is almost poetic in its beauty. The  trouble I had with it, though, is that neither Paul nor Laura was a very  sympathetic character. By the end of the book I had the feeling that I had  been cheated in a way, for I felt that there had to have been something to  redeem Paul and his horrendous obsession with Laura.... Laura having  Alzheimers is just, I think. Serves her right, is what I really think. I do  not remember a character so thoroughly unlikeable in recent fiction as  Laura Coe Pettit. <br />Maybe I just too strongly relate to the characters of  Martha and Catherine. In any rate, this is a beautifully written story and  I am recommending it to anyone who loves finely wrought tale.	2000-09-16

I  almost couldn't finish the book because of the haphazard narrative style;  the tenses shift from past to present without warning -- or without reason,  and that habit the author has of interjecting dialogue without cues is  absolutely maddening. I have never seen anything like that before: Jake  blah blah blah and &quot;Suddenly says something.&quot; That particular  device was so irritating I almost couldn't focus on the plot.<br />It was a  good story but I really wish it had been told in a more straightforward  manner.	2000-08-11
US	51623542	R27DM22FG9XBCF	0451200152	728640065	The Town	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Flimsy Premise	I have read most of Bentley Little's books, and up til now have maintained a high level of admiration for his somewhat unusual plots and his writing style. But this latest book _The Town_ just doesn't seem to measure up to  _The Store_ or _The Ignored_.. I found the premise here  to be flimsy at  best, and the whole notion of a benevolent house spirit gone rogue just  doesn't make for a very convincing story line. I think he might've given us  a little more background on the Molokans for one thing, and all the red  herrings (the sinister nature of the mine, the Native American angle, the  disturbing activities of Adam and his fantasies etc.) didn't add to the  suspense. Plus, the time lines didn't add up: if Babunya remembered the  time &quot;shortly after WWI&quot; when the townsfolk burned Russiantown,  that would make her around ninety years old instead of seventy-four. <br />In  short, while I am still a great Bentley Little fan, this book disappointed  me. There was nothing new or intriguing or startling in this book. In fact  a lot of it sort of reminded me of a luke-warm, rehashed telling of  &quot;The Shining&quot;. Hopefully his next one'll be on a par with his  earlier works.	2000-05-16

The problem I have is that the characters seem to almost WANT TO tell more about themselves, but the  writer never really finishes the task of developing them further. There is  a great potential for a grand finale here, but it seems to sputter and  fizzle and finally sort of just peter out. Plus it seems as though these  characters just sort of pinball their way through the plot - bouncing off  each other but not really affecting anything major. Dede is troubled and  shoots Nolan..... and then what? She gets off scot-free? What about Delia's  missing family? Seems to me there would be more on that, too.<br />Overall,  this was an interesting read, but I was left fairly unsatisfied by the  loose ends at the conclusion. I didn't really find myself caring too deeply  for any of the characters -- and if pressed, I'm not sure I could even name  a protagonist. Cissy? Delia? Their personalities were drawn so blandly and  the action in the plot shot from one to another to another that I am left  with a vague feeling of &quot;Hey! This isn't finished yet!&quot;	2000-05-12

I thought this was one of the more refreshing books I've read in a while, due mainly to the fact that Larry is nothing special. I get so tired of reading novels where the protagonist is a billionaire or a stunningly  handsome James Bond-type character. I really enjoyed the mundane  descriptions of Larry growing up in Winnipeg, and how the events in his  life just sort of happened to him. I found the ordinary characters to be  much more believable and much more interesting than the usual hyped-up  characters who populate modern fiction. The layout of the book actually had  me wondering whether these chapters were originally written as short  stories; I too found the repetition of background material in each chapter  to be somewhat tedious. As a plot device it didn't really wash. Overall,  though, this is another Bargain Bin treasure that I am going to recommend  to others. I read &quot;Stone Diaries&quot; and must say that I liked this  one better. Hoorah for the common man!	2000-05-05

This book seems to generate a lot of heated discussion; and I, adding my two cents' worth, merely wish to say that for an adolescent writing from the perspective of an old man, I found it to be quite astonishing. The plot was a bit too derivitive (Henry James, Wharton, blah blah blah) and  certainly the old &quot;Evil Twin&quot; twist wasn't any gem of literary  brilliance. But hey! I read the paperback while on vacation at my in-laws',  and I was absorbed -- if not by the stellar dialogue -- at least I wanted  to find out how in heck a guy could kill his wife of 45 years. And take 300  pages to do it. <br />It's not the worst book I ever read, and if this is a  debut effort, I am going to keep my eye on this guy. When you're striving  to bury yourself in a novel (at your in-laws') a good old English murder  mystery is just the ticket.	2000-04-26

I kept waiting for  the entire plot to be revealed as a dream dreamed by an inmate in an asylum  - or maybe just a Walter Mitty-like daydream. I can't believe anyone took  this seriously. <br />I remember the Eighties as a time of self-absorption and  greed, and sadly enough, even the grossest violence depicted here sort of  loses its shock value after a while.<br />So where were the cops? Didn't  anyone miss those girls? Oh yeah, that's right. All those creepy Yuppies  looked so much alike and never really knew anyone..... and nobody ever  listened to anybody. I'm still disappointed.	2000-04-10

I bought it just because I was out of reading material... It was wonderful! I found the archaic prose style to be  absolutely appropriate and nothing in this book was too far-fetched or  boring. I guess I expected Thomas to bite it; if I may offer any criticism  at all, it would be that the character of  Thomas seemed to be a little  thinly drawn. I wish Lidie would've dwelled on her relationship to him a  little more, but I suppose her reluctance to is in keeping with what a  nineteenth-century woman would share with the reader. <br />All in all, I  found this to be a very good book, and recommend it highly!	2000-02-07

BUT! What is the deal anymore with his overblown, purple prose? His similies and  metaphors are overused to the point where it's almost ridiculous. I find  his extraneous descriptions to be so distracting, that I tend to skim his  books instead of really getting absorbed in them. That's a shame, since  this book has a fairly original, suspenseful plot. <br />But c'mon!  (&quot;Turning more heads than a coven of chiropractors&quot;)? I wish  Koontz would just stick to simple, straightforward story-telling and leave  the stupid figurative language out altogether.	2000-01-12

Anyway, my point is.... this is a highly entertaining novel, and I thought it was extremely fun and I couldn't put it down. So it reads like a screenplay. So what! Sometimes you want a good  old cliff-hanger, and this one does not fail to deliver. The whole concept  of time-travel was very well explained, and I think Crichton's material on  fourteenth century France was very detailed and well researched. <br />I  thought this was a great book; by that I mean it kept my attention and I  wasn't too distracted by the &quot;cinema-ready&quot; pace of the prose. If  I want to broaden my horizons intellectually, I will go back to the same  Joseph Conrad book I've been plowing through for the past year. Meanwhile,  though, a diversion like &quot;Timeline&quot; was entirely welcome!	2000-01-05

She seems best, however, at describing the landscape (with an almost lyrical, poetic manner) than at developing a  solid and coherent plot. I found the relationship between Marlis and  Candice to be unbelievable, and the entire Eleanor-thing was also a little  perplexing. <br />I am disappointed in how Erdrich describes Fargo. Her  descriptions are basically those of a late 1940's Fargo, and certainly does  not jibe with what Fargo, North Dakota, is like nowadays. Makes me wonder  if she's been up here lately. Perhaps she ought to pay a visit before  writing a novel about it.	1999-12-22

I found the pace rather slow, and was waiting until the last sentence for Ellen to  get a grip, get her children, and get out. The plot thread of the two  murdered infants was just a little TOO easy, yet at the same time too  preposterous to be believable. It seems hard to believe that in the late  30's/early 40's, the deaths of two infants would go unquestioned. I wasn't  convinced that Mary-Margaret's character was so warped because of her  abusive husband. And the elderly aunt: the name Salome didn't seem  believeable either, and her character was really nothing more than a  sinister hulk in the background.<br />I've read much better books, but this  one wasn't the worst I've read. Just wish it had been a little more  satisfying.	1999-12-15

It's always fun to read material from  unfamiliar writers, but less fun to read the old stand-bys. King's short  story is predictable and self-derivitive; and William Peter Blatty's  novella is so filled with purple prose and almost Bulwer-Littonish bad  writing that I couldn't even finish it. And Joyce Carol Oates is good -- as  usual, but her point of view confused me. Who is the narrator? One of the  children? Which child?<br />There were quite a few editorial thorns in this  anthology as well. In &quot;An Exultation of Termagants&quot; one  character's name is spelled LILLY at one point, and then it inexplicably  changes to LILY thereafter. Is there a reason for this? Did I miss  something? In other stories fine, unimportant details are not kept track of  very well. (A blue Jeep Cherokee is later described as a green Jeep etc.)  Minor, nit-picky points, but I still get annoyed by things like  that.<br />Overall, though, this is a fun collection to have and I'm keeping  an eye on some of the lesser-known writers.

What a shame; I hope you all have good teachers who can teach this wonderful book in a way to make it vivid  and real for you. Wharton is a rare writer who can take a simple winter's  day and turn it into a finely-wrought canvas. The story of Ethan Frome  itself is very interesting and I myself read the book from cover to cover  in one sitting. The ending is a surprise, and brings to mind the old adage:  Be careful of what you wish for. You might get it.<br />Perhaps because this  book is almost ninety years old and doesn't have a splashy, gory cover or  jacket blurbs from modern hacks, it appears to young people as boring.

The first five-sixths of the book was about as I had hoped. I was eager to find out what happened to Frank, and his extreme poverty during  his early years in New York was about as heart-breaking to read about as  was his childhood in Limerick. I don't know if McCourt exaggerated to make  his point.One almost hopes so. His descriptions of himself as a young man  are fairly dreadful. Makes me wonder how he managed to land the fabulous  WASP babe he married and later divorced.<br />The last few chapters seemed  rushed and not as well-thought-out as the rest of the book. And there were  a few loose ends: what *was* with the eye infection? How did he meet his  (2nd?) wife?

I found A.  Scott Berg's treatment of the historic flight, the kidnapping, the world's  opinion of Lindbergh during WWII - and his later years, to be nothing less  than 100% objective and fair. I think Berg does an outstanding job of  presenting &quot;just the facts&quot; and allows the reader to draw his own  conclusions. Although it's clear that Berg admires the great man and his  family, he never editorializes or sensationalizes. That is a rare trait in  biographies these days. I am recommending this book to everyone I know; I  have copied lines of poetry and prose from this book into my own journal.  Lindbergh's final line about &quot;... I am of the stars&quot; ranks right  up there with the most profound to be found anywhere.	1999-09-17

I read the book, and  found it quite interesting and well written. But whatever HORROR there  was in the plot was superseded by a dry, tongue-in-the-cheek humor that  sometimes wore pretty thin. I recognized allusions to Louise Erdrich's work  (in using Pillager as a last name for one of the characters, and  &quot;Louise&quot; as a main character). <br />Overall, this wasn't all that  great a read as a horror novel - and Disch's use of locations in Minnesota  is confusing at best. Since when is Leech Lake near St. Cloud? And the  Wabashas? Not likely. Also, I'm not sure Sinclair Lewis is actually buried  in Sauk Centre. Anyway.

Most of the reviews I've read here give Horwitz' book four or five stars.

Well, what do you expect? I don't sense that Horwitz has  exaggerated; in fact it seems to me he's taken great pains and has made a  huge effort to be (and sound) even-handed and fair. Face it: the Civil War  has been over for 130+ years and my first instinct is to echo the time-worn  sentiment of many: &quot;Get over it!&quot;<br />But you do still keep a sense  of regional pride and we here in the upper Midwest face a similiar  phenomenon. The rest of the world sees us as farm-raised, naive, insular  yokels and it's difficult sometimes to dispel the myth. Tell someone you're  from Minnesota - or North Dakota - and you get a derisive snort in reply.  So I understand the feeling of loyalty those who love the South and live  there still carry. <br />But. The War's over. I think Horwitz has done a  wonderful thing in researching and writing this book. I was especially  fascinated with the chapter on Shelby Foote. It's a must-read for anyone  who's curious about  the Civil War.	1999-06-30

It seems like he gave up and just threw a bunch of crap together, bundled the manuscript up, sent it off, and called it good. What's with the garbled  points of view? I found this book to be an insult direct from Harris to his  fans. The plot was wooden and predictable in the beginning, moderately  interesting in the Florence scenes, and then degenerated into total  self-indulgent nonsense at the end. I agree: I think Harris has fixed his  own wagon so he won't be expected to continue the saga of Lecter and  Clarice. I see his attitude as &quot;Hey, screw you American Reading  Public. You asked for a &quot;sequel&quot;, here you go, now leave me  alone.&quot;<br />I'm disappointed in this.	1999-06-17
