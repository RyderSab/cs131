However, the book is supposed to present on overview of Indian history, spanning from prehistoric empires to the coming of British rule (the Raj), so its age would not preclude me from recommeding it to anyone.  The text is insightful, clear, and well-illustrated with photos and prints of classical Indian art and architecture.<br />I read this book before travelling to India on a vacation, and it was a very useful learning tool for me.	2002-06-05

I agree with other reviewers that each book in the Alvin Maker series cannot stand alone and must be viewed as a 300-page chapter in a longer work.  The plot is also rather weak, about a man with all-encompassing magical powers trying to create a utopian city, but these books are not about the Crystal City, any more than LORD OF THE RINGS was about Frodo Baggins and his magic ring.  Like Tolkien, Card is using a simple journey plot to give his readers the opportunity to explore a strange new fictional universe.<br />Unlike traditional fantasy, however, Card's universe is an \\"alternate\\" America, circa 1800, similar to the real America except that frontier superstitions, Indian folklore, and African voodoo are all real.  Over the course of five books, Card has examined Midwest frontier life, the American Indian struggle, Puritan witch trials, Appalachian mountaineers, French outpost settlements, and opulent Southern slave plantations.  We have met numerous historical figures, some accurately depicted, others a mere caricature of their real selves.  We have debated religion, politics, and law.  It is clear Card is steering us towards a finale where all these subcultures learn to coexist in a true melting pot society.<br />Like other readers, I too am ready for Card to begin to wrap up the story, but as long as he continues to create such a unique new landscape, and populate it with quirky, textured characters, I'll keep reading.	2002-04-29

This book comes across as a hybrid of the two.  King addresses serious issues such as growing old and abortion rights, but the story itself is pulp horror comedy, complete with troll-like demons, magic rings, and evil spirits that can take human and animal shapes.<br />The characters are well-developed, and the story is fun, especially at first, but it is not good enough to carry its 800 pages.  Unlike other King milestones-like The Stand or Dark Tower series-this book becomes tedious and repetitive.  In the end, it's about an elderly couple trying to save 2000 people from getting killed by right-wing fanatics who are unwittingly being manipulated by supernatural forces.  Even the protagonists don't seem to care too much whether they succeed.   For Dark Tower fans, there is also a small event near the end that will affect the story of Roland the Gunslinger.<br />My recommendation is to skip this one.  King has written many other, more entertaining novels.	2002-04-29

Here is a man who spent his life in two worlds most of us never experience.  For ten years, Nash devoted himself to the estranged, eccentric, \\"ivory tower\\" world of abstract mathematical research, where his unbelievable feats of intellect were matched only by his extreme social and sexual immaturity.  His peers recognized him as being a true genius, but his often mean-spirited behavior and utter selfishness turned people off and resulted in his being passed over for important awards and university positions.  Then, he suffered a schizophrenic break, and spent the next thirty years in and out of mental hospitals, undergoing electroshock and insulin coma therapy, haunted by complex, fanciful delusions that he was at the center of vast government and alien conspiracies.  Supported only by his wife and a few friends, he eventually recovered and was awarded a Nobel Prize for his contributions to the field of economics and his research into game theory.<br />Unlike the recent movie, which omitted the seedier side of Nash's life in order to make him more sympathetic, Sylvia Nasar does not pull her punches.  Her book explores the entire man - his intellectual brilliance, his emotional aloofness, his insecurity, and his willingness to prey sexually on men and women desperate for affection.  It neither lionizes him for his accomplishments nor demonizes him for his faults.  With detached objectivity, she describes both his \\"discovery\\" of a new equilibrium in cooperative games and his abandonment of a mistress and illegitimate son.  As a reader, I was both awed and repelled at the same time.  But it was the story of a life worth reading.  <br />My one criticism of the book is that Nasar writes like a journalist, never presenting a fact without documentation.  The result is that every paragraph is littered with quotes from sources - friends, acquaintances, newspapers, journals,government documents, etc.  The book reads like an extended newspaper article.  It takes longer to digest, and it gets bogged down in details (such as long chapters on the history of MIT and Princeton University).  I prefer biographies that are more narrative in style, that get to the point quicker, and that are more emotionally engaging.	2002-03-16

Unfortunately, I found his short stories somewhat confusing and hard to understand.  The magical elements seemed more like whimsy than serious literature.  I bought this book because I thought it would help me learn about GGM and how to decipher his writings.<br />This is a very slim, light-hearted biography of GGM's life and work.  It is illustrated with \\"cutesy\\" cartoons and caricatures that manage to be both clever and annoying at the same time.  The book is useful if you (like me) are unfamiliar with the references to Latin American customs, legends, and politics.  Its biggest flaw is that it does not devote much space to discussing magical realism, the literary style that GMM invented and perfected, but it did at least give me some perspective on Latin America culture and GMM's early life experiences.  I think I know enough now to go back and appreciate those stories.	2002-03-16
US	51754136	R3E9140BTK25UP	0060176555	350955066	Homebody	Books	3	0	1	N	N	A good ghost story (with a slightly hokey ending)	In the mid-1990's, Orson Scott Card ventured away from his usual science fiction and Mormon books to try his hand at a more commercial genre:  ghost stories.  Homebody is the last of a trilogy of ghost stories published by HarperCollins.  <br />Homebody is Card's spin on the old-fashioned haunted house story.  During the first two-thirds of the book, Card uses the motif sparingly, giving only hints of the supernatural to provide thrust to the plot.  The tale centers around three lonely people in North Carolina, each alone, each trapped by guilt, each able to find friendship and forgiveness within the beauty and tragedy of an abandoned house near the local college.  The concluding act is something of a letdown, as Card's great character-driven subplots give way to ghosts and magical spells.  The most interesting female character, a mother grieving over her decision to abandon her family, is written out prematurely to set up a love story between the leading man and a vagrant woman, who (predictably) turns out to be the ghost of a murdered university student.     <br />Despite its flaws, Card's writing is a refreshing change. Most modern American writers write about characters with severe sexual, emotional, and personal dysfunctions (if you don't believe me, take a quick scan of the [book club] over the last two years).   But an Orson Scott Card book is like a Frank Capra film.  The characters are wholesome, idealistic, and noble.  Even their mistakes are well-intentioned.  They are usually plagued by self-doubt, but in the end, they always manage to do the right thing, for the right reason, with the right result. Card writes about normal people making responsible life decisions. He creates good people you can actually care about.  <br />And he is a good enough storyteller that even a ghost story with a slight hokey ending is worth reading.	2002-02-28

Maybe it's because I had more fun reading about scary, man-eating dragons than cute, lovable ones.  Maybe it's because the stories in this volume are more dramatic and less comical.  Or maybe it's just because a few of these stories tickled my imagination, while none of the others did.<br />It is still not a great anthology, but three of the fifteen stories are well worth reading.  <br />1.  \\"Alas, My Love, You Do Me Wrong\\" is a haunting study of a father and son who are unable to relate to each other, and who pay a terrible price.  <br />2. \\"Negwenya\\" is a well-crafted piece on racial tensions during apartheid in South Africa.  <br />3.  \\"Plague of Butterflies\\" is Orson Scott Card's only foray into Latino-style magical realism, with surprisingly good results.  (There is a small essay on how this story came to be written in the book \\"Maps in a Mirror: The Short Fiction of Orson Scott Card\\").<br />Unfortunately, there are also more than a few lighthearted duds like \\"Middle Woman\\" (written by Card under a pseudonym), \\"Lady of the Purple Forest\\", and \\"Fear of Fly\\" (in which a lady knight saves a handsome prince-in-distress from a large dragonfly).  Plus, a few adventure sci-fi stories like \\"Storm King\\" and \\"Though All the Mountains Lie Between\\".  I was surprised to see \\"Thermals of August\\" included since it features an erotic lesbian scene, and Card is known for his religious stance against homosexuality.<br />Overall, I would not recommend this.  Card has published much better science fiction anthologies, such as MASTERPIECES and FUTURE ON ICE.	2002-01-26

The book's major premise is that the phenomena of human evil should be studied as a branch of psychiatry, subject to the strict scrutiny and observance of science.  Peck maintains that we have only a very dim view of how evil operates, and what forms it takes, because the scientific community has always refused to make the necessary value judgements to discern good from evil.  We need to find a healthy middle ground between religious and psychiatric schools of thought.  Peck supports his theories with many anecdotal stories from practicing  psychiatry in government, military, and private settings.  <br />These case studies are the best part of the book, even if you do not agree with Peck's conclusions.  They present fascinating examples of the depths of evil in some \\"everyday people\\" and how these people manipulate others to avoid being exposed.  Peck makes an interesting deduction that evil results from the twin forces of laziness and intense narcissism.  As a liberal Christian, he describes (and encourages) using exorcisms to heal patients of  demonic possession.   Unfortunately, his political views obviously biased his perceptions of the military and the Vietnam War, which he discusses at length in a chapter on \\"group evil\\". <br />Overall, the book is a mixed bag of theology, science, and self-help. Personally, I do not believe narcissistic parents should be labeled as \\"evil,\\" while mass-murdering psychotics are merely \\"sick\\".   Nor do I accept Peck's opinions (which he presents as fact) about Satan, Hell, and the salvation of non-Christians.  But the call for the scientific community to engage in a systematic study of evil has proved beneficial, since it has resulted in increased use of  psychiatry in law enforcement and criminal rehabilitation.	2002-01-03

But I grew bored mid-way through Fellowship of the Ring, as the second half of that book focused on the ancient histories and alien geography of Middle Earth.  I never finished the trilogy.<br />When I picked up both books fifteen years later, I had the reverse experience.  The Hobbit was still fun to read, but rather childish and simple.  On the other hand, FOTR captured my imagination because of the incredibly complex, detailed lore surrounding Middle Earth. Tolkien spends much time discussing the differences in attitudes, customs, and languages of his three major races  men, dwarves, and elves  almost as if he were writing an anthropology textbook rather than a novel.<br /><br />Frodos mission to destroy the Great Ring, while exciting, serves primarily as device to flesh out the mythos of the Middle Earth universe.  Indeed, some of the most exciting action scenes in the recent movie version (Gandalfs battle with the evil wizard; the capture and escape of Gollum) occur off camera in the book and are related to the reader second-hand.  Other important sequences, such as the battle with the demon balrog, occupy only a few brief pages.<br />This book is not for everybody.  It demands a lot of patience through long passages of exposition and backstory.  It leaves gaps in the narrative for readers to flesh out in their imaginations.  But, once you begin to understand the intricacies of Tolkiens world, it becomes an engrossing experience.  I will wait another year before reading the next volume (just in time for the movie, probably).  But I plan to buy a copy of the Silmarillion this week to brush up on the stories of ancient Middle Earth, events alluded to in FOTR but never fully explained.	2002-01-03

It is not surprising the creator of Middle Earth, and the father of the fantasy genre, would create such an elaborate, creative collection of Christmas stories for his children.  This book is a nice addition to my library, as it contains the text of the letters, as well as Tolkien's hand-drawn illustrations and North Pole post markings.<br />While this book does not relate to his Middle Earth universe, it is easy to recognize the origin of some of its characters.  The goblin attack on Santa's cellar presages the Goblin-Elf wars in Lord of the Rings.  Santa's elf-secretary Ilbereth is the obvious progenitor of the ancient elf-queen Elbereth.  We even get a glimpse of elvish writing and the goblin alphabet!<br />If you have the chance, buy the new revised version of this book.  I have the 1991 reissue edition.  It is only 48 pages long, and omits the letters from 1920 - 1924 and from 1939-1942 .  The new edition is one hundred pages longer and contains previously unpublished material.	2001-12-31

Each story has a bizarre twist-- which the characters never seem to recognize as strange-- that is used to emphasize the futility of human emotion.  The effect is similar to \\"magical realism,\\" where an author uses supernatural elements but treats them as commonplace.  Here are a few examples:<br />\\"Tales of a Kept Ape\\" is told in first-person, through the eyes of a frustrated lover who cannot understand why the woman he adores has alienated herself from his affections.  Bizarre twist:  The jilted lover is a pet ape the woman has been sleeping with.<br />In the title story, a middle aged divorced father worries that his fourteen year old daughter has fallen into a lesbian relationship with an older woman.  Bizarre twist:  The older woman is a three-foot dwarf.<br />In \\"Dead as They Come\\", we watch an obsessive, arrogant millionaire fall madly in love with a woman, only to destroy the relationship out of uncontrollable jealousy.  Bizarre twist:  The woman is a department store mannequin. <br />My complaint of these stories is that the bizarre \\"twists\\" are never explicitly dealt with by the characters.  It's as if McEwan wants us to believe that loving an ape, or a dwarf, or a mannequin  is no less strange (or less hopeless) than loving another human being.  So, each tale becomes a plodding, why-can't-we-get-along diatribe that is neither interesting nor enlightening.	2001-12-18

Some religious authors over glorify the characters, making them saints, reducing their credibility and immediacy.  Non-religious authors usually try to reinterpret the Bible to fit a \\"modernized\\" word-view or social gospel, which changes the meaning of the story.  Fortunately, Buechner avoids both of these pitfalls with this re-imagining of the lives of Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph.  He ruthlessly depicts ancient cultures, full of graphic sex and violence, where God chooses a few unworthy messengers to carry out his work amid the backdrop of pagan gods and brutal animal sacrifice.  <br />While the forefathers of the Jewish and Christian faiths are more wholesome and generally better behaved than their contemporaries, they often misinterpret the meaning of God's words, leading to bad decisions and dysfunction.   Jacob ends up married to two squabbling sisters, siring children by his servants, and watching his older sons  sell his favorite son into slavery.  In fact, when you think about it, Jacob makes very few good decisions and leads a troubled life no one would envy.  Yet, out of the turmoil, he becomes a \\"hero of the faith\\" and changes the course of history forever.<br />Buechner has a gift for direct, strong, image-laden prose that moves his story forward without too much analysis or \\"preaching\\".  His voice is at times sorrowful, humorous, or downright cranky.  His account embellishes on the Biblical versions without contradicting them.   He relishes in showing us his characters' flaws and mistakes, all the while highlighting the work of \\"the Fear\\" in their lives.  I urge you to read this book; you'll never look at Genesis the same way again.	2001-12-18

Ashley treats us with every variety of the legend imaginable. First, he draws from pre-Malory sources: a retelling of the last chapter of Geoffrey of Monmouth's History of Britain; &quot;The Lady of the Fountain&quot; from the Mabinogian, an ancient collection of Celtic myths; and the 12th century epic poem Jaufry, which was forgotten for 600 years. <br />He also includes retellings of famous selections from Le Morte D'Arthur, including Steinbeck's take on Sir Balin and the Dolorous Stroke, and Roger Lancelyn Green's somewhat liberal translation of the &quot;Tale of Perceval&quot;. <br />And finally there are many modern fantasy stories that treat the Arthuran mythology in turns as comical, idyllic, historical, or romantic. The depictions of Merlin and Arthur vary from author to author depending on the mood and setting, but that is what makes the legend so exciting to study. <br />I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in the stories of King Arthur and Camelot.	2001-10-22

Unfortunately, this one is not high on my list of recommendations.  Only nine stories are presented here, and many essential tales, such as the \\"Death of Merlin\\" and \\"Tristram and Isode\\", are omitted completely.<br />Vinaver's translation is cumbersome because, although he claims to modernize spellings and standardize names, there are still many words and phrases he chooses not to translate, so the reader has to constantly refer to footnotes at the bottom of the page.  If I wanted to do all this work, I would have read the original version with no modernization at all!   <br />The only redeeming addition to this book is the preface which discusses the difference between Mallory's version of the Arthurian romance and the French Vulgate Cycle upon which he drew his material.  Instead of this edition, I would refer readers to Keith Baines' modern prose edition (ISBN: 0451625676).  It contains all the stories and is much easier to read.	2001-07-17

In the three stories, Aldiss poses two good questions: &#8220;Can robots feel love?&#8221; and &#8220;If so, are they human?&#8221;, but he never gives us satisfactory answers.  Throughout the trilogy, David remains a static, unchanging little boy incapable of articulating or learning from his experiences.  The only character the audience can empathize and grow with is the aging, philandering father, who learns nothing in the end except that greed can ruin your life.  The worst thing about these stories, though, is that they fail to cover any new ideas that have not already been discussed before, most notably by Isaac Asimov&#8217;s far superior &#8220;Bicentennial Man&#8221;.<br />The sixteen short stories that follow are much, much worse.  Most of them teeter on the edge between dramatic fiction and satire, so that they are neither interesting nor funny.  Only &#8220;Apogee Again&#8221; contains any imaginative ideas and descriptions.  Some of the stories, such as &#8220;A Whiter Mars&#8221; and &#8220;Cognitive Ability and the Light Bulb&#8221;, are not really stories at all; they are summary descriptions of how society will evolve into a vegetarian, religion-less utopia.  Others, such as &#8220;Dark Society&#8221; and &#8220;Steppenpferd&#8221;, start out promising but leave the reader with lady-or-the-tiger endings, without any resolution to the conflict.  <br />Please, please don&#8217;t waste your money on this collection.	2001-07-17

Unfortunately, Card's best works are often overlooked in favor of his more commercial, action-oriented fantasy franchises, such as the Ender Wiggen novels and the Tales of Alvin Maker.  This book features five interrelated stories in a post-apocalypse America, character-driven pieces that deal with `fitting in' on the edge of society. These are not the kind of  subjects that appeal to sci-fi's ready-made fan base of teenage boys, but the mileu will turn away readers who do not like science fiction. The characters are mostly Mormons, a fringe group themselves, who are portrayed as long-suffering people persecuted at the hands of mainstream Christians. <br />But underneath the exterior premise, Card displays some very strong writing.  \\"The Fringe\\" contains the best depiction I've ever read of the struggle and rage of a handicapped character.  In \\"Pageant Wagon,\\" Card creates some very complex family relationships, and writes a stirring ode to the possibilities of theater, all within a few short pages.    On the whole, this is Card doing what he does best - exploring how human relationships operate and survive under extreme conditions.	2001-07-05

It's fast-paced and engaging, and the characters' offbeat dialects are just plain fun to read.  They live in the 1800's (well sort of, its an alternate reality) and unlike many modern-day novels, they don't talk or act as if they grew up in the 1980's. They seem genuine, or as genuine as they can be in a world where magic and coincidence are equally common parts of life. <br />At this point in the series, Card allows himself to have a little more fun, as the action criss-crosses the Atlantic, and we get to meet hilariously distorted versions of Napolean, Marquis de LaFayette, Benjamin Harris, and Daniel Webster.   This book is much better than the low point of the series (RED PROPHET) because there is less hocus-pocus Indian magic and more character development.  But it is not as fresh or inventive as the original (SEVENTH SON) partly because Alvin's naivete and innocence is much more believable in a ten-year old boy than a 25-year old adult. I look forward to the end of the series, but like many other reviewers, I wish it would come soon.	2001-07-02

Fitzgerald was less than halfway finished when he died, and the seventeen \\"completed\\" episodes were in obvious need of re-editing.  Judging from the author's notes, they would have been revised extensively anyway to fit his shifting vision of how the plot would evolve.  There are moments of clever satire on the Hollywood Industry (and especially its writers) that would probably have made the finished product well worth reading, but Fitzgerald was still struggling to balance the satirical tone of his novel with the love story of its protagonists.  The editor's notes were very helpful, though, inasmuch as they showed what direction Fitzgerald wanted to take and the alternate endings he had in mind.	2001-07-02

As far as kids' books go, this one is pretty good.   The story is simple, but the illustrations are unique, with every picture combining elements of medieval fantasies (castles, knights, dragons, abbots) and contemporary life (computers, scanners, office meetings).  It is also interesting when the text says one thing, such as \\"Queen Heather mounted her steed\\", and the picture shows something different, like the Queen speeding off in a sports car.  The subject matter is a bit mature; the pictures (more than the prose) imply acts of suicide and adultery. However, everything works out happily ever after in the end.	2001-04-13

The story starts out with a strong premise: Harry Pendel, tailor to Panama's rich and famous, has a compulsive habit of telling tall tales, which leads to unpredictable mayhem when he gets recruited by a British spy.  Instead of the usual James Bond buffoonery --thrilling chases, gratuitous sex, outrageous villains-we get dry British wit and sly social satire.  <br />Le Carre demands a certain amount of sophistication from his readers.  Historic American-Panama events -- the Canal Treaty, the Carter visit, Operation Just Cause.-are important to the plot but never explained to the uninformed.  The book also subtly plays on classic stereotypes - for example, the British spy Andrew Osnard is presented as a drinker, gambler, and womanizer (just like James Bond), but also a fat, gullible comic foil.    <br />If the author had put Harry Pendel's just-quirky-enough-to-be-believable character in an straight-up spy thriller, this could have been a great book that managed to balance suspense, humor, and social critique.  Instead, Le Carre asks us to believe the British Secret Service would send a 26-year old rookie into Panama to retrieve evidence of an international conspiracy, and then fork over millions of dollars based on the uncollaborated testimony of one ex-con-turned-informant.   He surrounded Pendel with characters far too stupid to be seen as anything other than caricatures.  The conclusion is so implausible (a secret cadre of Right Wing politios manipulate the media to start a war), it only be read as slapstick satire, ala \\"Dr. Strangelove\\".   Unfortunately, for me at least, the jokes just weren't funny.	2001-04-13

Besides being just a great page-turner, the author demonstrates a few very unique and engaging storytelling techniques:<br />The gimmick of the book is that the main character's death is \\"foretold\\" from the beginning.  Readers know from the opening chapter that Santiago Nasir is going to die, and when, and why, and by whom.  The story generates suspense, not because we do not know the outcome, but because we see the inevitable happening and feel powerless to stop it.  Like watching a train wreck, we cannot keep from staring, and we feel guilty when we enjoy it so much. <br />The murder is also foretold to other characters.  Almost everyone in the book has the opportunity to intervene but for a variety of reasons-apathy, malice, fear, coincidence-do not.  Marquez heaps irony upon irony, mingling both comedic and violent scenes, highlighting the role of fate in our lives.  On another level, this novel is also a scathing indictment of Latino \\"machismo\\", a culture that turns two young boys into killers to protect their sister's honor and makes an entire town of bystanders accessories to the fact. <br />The narrator tells his story in a pseudo-journalistic style, through interviews and flashbacks.  This allows Marquez to tell and re-tell scenes from different vantage points, jumping back and forth in time, adding details and exposing layer after layer of hidden motives.  By the time we actually see the murder scene, we already know all the actions that led up to it and the repercussions that will result. <br />Although Marquez is known for his use of magical realism, this tale is told without the use of the supernatural, excepting one small incident near the end, when a young girl sees an apparition of Santiago climbing the stairs to his bedroom, just before he is murdered outside her door.	2001-04-08

The adapter A. E. Hochner also throws in an informative essay on the art of adapting.  While this will certainly interest would-be playwrights and Hemingway afficionados, there is little else of substance here.<br />The short story is little more than a premise--a poor Bahamian fisherman finds a sunken luxury yacht and tries unsuccessfully to scavenge it-with no supporting characters and an unsatisfactory resolution.  Hochner adds villians, conspiracies, and two love triangles to spice things up.  The result is a better-than-average TV movie, due to solid performances by Benjamin Bratt and Armand Assante, but it is still too slow and formulaic to meet the standards of a feature film.	2001-04-03

While I did not agree with either theologian on all points, this somewhat overly scholarly debate did help me reexamine my own beliefs and determine why I believe what I believe.<br />Dr. House argued that capital punishment is not only condoned but also commanded by God in the Old Testament, and he used New Testament passages to affirm those commands were universal and unchanging.  His arguments relied heavily on his interpretion of Genesis 9 (the Noachian Covenant) as a universal mandate establishing God's relationship to man, and man's relationship to each other.  Unfortunately, I felt he took the \\"easy\\" way out by claiming that the entire Mosaic Law had been invalidated by Christ and therefore was not relevant to his case.  I think a more fair analysis would have been to divide the Mosaic Laws into moral, religous, and legal subcomponents and deal with each  separately.<br />Dr. Yoder used a standard \\"Christ-transforming-culture\\" argument to assert that God's acceptance of capital punishment has changed from Biblical times to today.  The themes of Christ's teachings have helped evolve modern culture past the need for retribution-based systems of punishment (i.e., some Scriptures have to be interpreted in terms of the cultural bias of its authors).  Yoder explains away the Noachian Covenant as a reflection of an obsolete era and basis his arguments primarily on John 8, where Jesus pardons an alduteress about to be stoned to death.<br />I really enjoyed seeing this contemporary issue discussed from Scriptural postions.  Both men made interesting arguments, but I felt Dr. Yoder did not respect or believe in the infallibility of Scripture and tried to use secular sources (modern psychology and social science) to bend his interpretations.	2001-03-25

James M. Cain manages to squeeze a whole novel's worth of characters, plot twists, and emotions into only 116 pages.  Like Ernest Hemingway, Cain employs a minimalistic writing style to fashion uneducated, \\"simple\\" characters with complex emotional undercurrents.  He knows when to understate a scene and when to use vivid, erotic images to shock his readers.  His pacing is nearly flawless, except for one awkward scene with the briefly-mentioned Madge Allen character.  And the conclusion, while somewhat of a cliche, is typical of the best 1930's roman noir fiction.     <br />The only reason I gave this book 3 stars instead of 4 is that I wish Cain had added more dialogue and development scenes at the beginning to show how Frank and Cora fell in love and fed off each other's neuroses.	2001-03-25

His handling of Moses and Pharaoh is similar to what we've seen before (one still thinks of Charlton Heston and Yul Brenner), but it is the minor characters that make this novel come alive -- the gruff Jethro, an ambitious Aaron,  a painfully fussy Miriam.  Their idiosyncrasies and relationships with Moses transform this narrative from a heavy-handed Sunday School lesson into a heartfelt novel that made me laugh, ponder, and believe all over again.  <br />Card includes tidbits about Mormon history and theology, which I could have done without, but he was very forthright in his introduction about the historical liberties he took and the worldview from which he drew.  Once again, Card proved his talent at combining great characters with great plots, his \\"literary fiction\\" being just as good, if not better, than his more well-known science fiction.	2001-02-21

I saw the play (also written by A.C.) before I read the book, so I knew who the killer was, but there were still plenty of surprises.  The book only got four stars because, as another reviewer pointed out, A.C. crammed too many bad guys on one cruise ship -- a political assasin, a kleptomaniac, a jewel thief, a would-be killer, the real killer, etc.  It was exciting, but not as &quot;realistic&quot; as Murder on the Orient Express and Murder of Roger Ackroyd.<br />I'll promise you one thing about this book:  Even if you figure out the identity of the killer, you'll never guess how it was done.	2001-02-10

Let me just utter &quot;ditto&quot; to everything Lowkell said in his excellent review.<br />Here are the main points you need to know before reading this novel:<br />1.  If you are a fan of science fiction, you will be blown away by the detail and complexity of Frank Herbert's imagined universe.  I've never read anything quite like it.  It truly has a &quot;cast of thousands&quot; and weaves together over twenty subplots.<br />2.  If you are a fan of simple, direct writing, skip this book.  Read DUNE only if you enjoy complicated, interwoven plots full of ambiguities and mysteries that the reader must &quot;unravel&quot; for himself.<br />3.  Underneath the details, mysteries, intrigues, and &quot;feints within feints,&quot; the story boils down to a boy with special powers who saves an entire race of humans from extinction. Personally, I don't much care for superheroes and think the story would have been better if Paul Atreides had been an ordinary man who accomplished these amazing feats.	2001-02-10
US	51754136	RBKQNBMKAZ6JS	0425178986	556294920	The Pledge	Books	4	34	35	N	N	A different kind of pot boiler	It is difficult to review this novel, written by a Swiss author and set outside Zurich in 1957.  At first, it appears to be a standard police-officer-chases-child-killer crime novel.  But unlike American novels, there is little character development, sparse detail, and no subplots to \\"flesh out\\" the rather bleak storyline.  The prose plods along methodically, almost mimicking its stubborn protagonist, and the dialogue is at times awkward.  <br />But I hesitate to attribute any of this to bad writing because everything else about the story is so carefully constructed and obviously planned from the beginning.  About half-way through the book, I became so engrossed I could not put it down.  The final resolution, which relies heavily on coincidence, perfectly reinforces themes of randomness and absurd cruelty that run through the novel.  Any other ending would seem contrived.  You get the feeling that European audiences have different expectations about how stories are supposed to flow, and I strongly suspect a lot of metaphor and imagery has been lost in the translation to English.<br />A movie based on this novel, and starring Jack Nicholson, should be coming out soon.	2001-01-19

Reichheld's \\"customer lifecycle profit\\" and \\"customer value proposition\\" concepts provide a unique, innovative framework for evaluating your company's philosophies and strategies.  The chapter on finding the \\"right\\" investor defies almost everything I learned in my MBA program.   <br />The second half of the book explains (in excruciating detail) how to set up measurement and incentive systems based on this loyalty-based framework.  Unfortunately, the author only gives passing mention (in Ch. 10) to the fact that these systems are not applicable to many businesses, including technology firms and makers of commodity products.  As an IT analyst in a paper company, I got little tangible benefit from Reichheld's discussions.	2001-01-15

I highly recommend keeping a copy of  Ender's Game nearby when you read Shadow.  It's really neat to compare  scenes in one book and see how they dovetail with scenes in the other.   <br />This technique allowed OSC to explore details about his fictional world  that were omitted from the previous version.  He revisited old characters  and scenes, fleshing them out with new detail and sometimes altering their  significance just enough to give readers a fresh vision of his universe,  without fundamentally changing its story.  <br />The main characters of both  novels seems more human, more whole, once we've seen them through each  other's eyes.  <br />The only flaw was that OSC tried to outdo his first book  by making Bean (the protagonist of Shadow) smarter than Ender (the hero of  Game).  While this gave Bean the chance to work \\"behind the scenes\\" and  learn things Ender never did, it also resulted in more than a few stilted  scenes and passages of dialogue where Bean's actions in Game did not fit  his personality in Shadow.  In most cases, Card had to explain away the  discrepancies by attributing hidden or patronizing motives to Bean.   Sometimes, it worked and sometimes it seemed gimmicky.<br />Still, the concept  of a parallel novel has a lot of possibilities, and I would love to see  other authors give it a try.	2000-06-26

The  story was captivating from the first paragraph, and the characters were so  well drawn I felt as if I knew them personally.  King's use of supernatural  events owes more to Gabriel Garcia Marquez's &quot;magical realism&quot;  than earlier works like Carrie or Needful Things.<br />The only flaws in the  book were the absence of strong female characters (I loved King's Delores  Claiborne) and a tendency to be more wordy and repetitive than necessary.   This second flaw, however, can be traced to the fact the story was  originally serialized and published in six parts.	2000-01-25

Ansay's writing is wonderful if you like (as I do) the meandering &quot;academic literary&quot; style.  The characters were realistically drawn, even though  their personalities were well outside the normal realm of behavior.  <br />My  problem with the book is that I disagreed with its message.  The main  character, Ellen, makes the decision to leave her husband and abusive  in-laws to salvage her life and give her children a bearable future.   Ellen's struggle is supposed to be seen as a difficult, yet admirable  choice, but the cards were stacked in such a way that this ending was the  only reasonable outcome.  The male characters were all mean and lazy, the  Catholic Church chauvinistic and grossly inept, and the female characters  had been victimized by society's  gender roles.   <br />Rather than depicting  realistic options for dealing with a dysfunctional family, this book simply  endorses the feminist mindset that it is better for an unhappy woman to  break up her family than live in an oppressive situation.  There was no ray  of hope, no middle ground, and no serious attempt to explore or even  acknowledge the dangers of divorce.	2000-01-05

The book is much more powerful after you have tried to puzzle the meaning of the monolith for yourself.

It  answered my two main questions:  &quot;What did the story of HAL 9000 have  to do with the story of the monolith?&quot; and &quot;What did the ending  mean?&quot;<br />Unless you are a fan of the old school of &quot;hard&quot;  science fiction, you'll probably be annoyed by Clarke's overly-expository  writing style and obsessive devotion to scientific accuracy.  This story  was obviously written when the science was much more important than the  fiction.  At times, it reads like an astronomy textbook.   But, in the end,  all your questions from the movie will be answered.  If you like the  answers, you'll like the book.   If you enjoyed &quot;figuring out&quot;  the movie, the book will spoil the mystery for you.<br />In the final  analysis, this novel deserves high marks because without it the classic  film would never have been made, or at least would have turned out much  differently.  In his companion book &quot;The Lost Worlds of 2001,&quot;  Clarke describes how the movie and novel were developed simultaneously with  feedback in both directions.  Clarke would write a chunk of the story,  Kubrick would film it, then Clarke would revise what he had written to  parallel the movie.  Both Clarke and Kubrick wanted the movie and the novel  to be viewed as one collaborative effort, even though there are some minor  discrepancies between the two.  The story was originally inspired by  Clarke's much older short story &quot;The Sentinel&quot;.	1999-08-23

It faded out of print, then Card made some major revisions/rewrites and republished it in 1988 under a different title.  I  have not read the revised version, simply titled TREASON, but it is  supposed to be a complete overhaul with 10% new material.<br />As Card himself  has acknowledged, A Planet Called Treason is amateurish.  There is no  question Card has improved his tone, pacing, character development, and  storylines over the last twenty years.   But this story is still one of the  most imaginative I have ever read, despite the structural flaws.   This is  the kind of wild, no-holds-barred fantasy every 10-year old boy dreams  about, but few adults have the talent to write (Orson Scott Card and George  Lucas come to mind).  This novel illustrates why I enjoy OSC so much - even  when he's not in peak form, his books are still too fun to put down.   <br />One note about different versions:  There are differences between the  Dell paperback and the hardback edition (at least, the Book Club edition I  own).  First, the map included on page 1 is much more detailed in the  paperback version than the hardcover.  Second, I think there are some minor  editorial revisions in the paperback.

I made an exception in this case,  however, because the same author penned both the novel and the screenplay.  This is his story, from start to finish, and he tells it well, in both film  and print.<br />Most everyone has seen the movie, so I'll be brief and just  say the book is better:  the book contains scenes cut from the movie; the  story is more effective in print because it takes longer to build up and  develop some of the crucial moments; the biting dialogue is not lost in the  montage of on-screen violence; and the characters seem  better developed.   The only elements that translate better on the big screen are, obviously,  the battle scenes.	1999-07-25

You don't often find stories this enticing. I was hooked from the first page, a vivid scene of the 90-year old heroine surveying her life, her family, and ghosts of old  mistakes come back to haunt her.  Despite its hefty length, this book kept  me coming back for more, daydreaming at work about what would happen next,  and staying up late at night to get to the next chapter.  I read it in just  a few days even though with my schedule it usually takes me at least a week  to finish a book. <br />However, despite the story's addictive sway, Sheldon's  writing style did not meet my expectations.  After reading all the glowing  reviews at Amazon.com, I expected this to be a terrific epic that would  leave me awed and inspired, something in the vein of Gone With the Wind or  Lonesome Dove.  Instead, &quot;Master of the Game&quot; is more akin to  John Jake's &quot;North and South&quot; -- yes, it is a multigenerational  saga full of adventure, betrayal, and suspense, but it  resembles a  television screenplay more than a novel.  The author moves from scene to  scene, from tragedies to triumphs and back again, at a breakneck pace with  only the barest attention paid to character development and plausibility.   While I enjoyed the twists and turns of the story, it started to seem a bit  melodramatic and predictable.  You didn't have to be a brain surgeon to  realize that [spoiler alert!]  Salomon van der Mewre was going to cheat  Jamie McGregor out of the money.  Or that Tony would fall in love with  Marianne rather than Lucy - and that it was Kate's plan all along. [end  spoiler].    <br />This book is pure brain candy, all fun with no substance.   Similar to a night-time TV soap like Dallas -- you can predict what is  going to happen, you know it is wildly improbable, but yet it has just the  right mixture of intelligence, ruthlessness, and intrigue to keep you  coming back.	1999-07-23
US	51754136	R1HO8BF7JRD3A1	0451076451	116097775	Rage	Books	3	14	18	N	N	A good story, but you can tell King was still maturing	The most interesting thing about &quot;Rage&quot; is its history:   Stephen King began writing this novel his senior year in high school, finished it in 1971, and published it as an original paperback in 1977  under the pseudonym Richard Bachman.  Years later, after it became public  knowledge that Stephen King and Richard Bachman were one and the same, it  was republished in hardcover as part of an omnibus called THE BACHMAN  BOOKS, which contained the first four novels published under the Bachman  penname (there were six in all).  In the years since, all the Bachman  novels have been reprinted as separate paperbacks--all except Rage. In  response to the recent school shooting tragedy at Columbine High School  (and the anti-media backlash it caused), King decided to pull Rage out of  print, forever.   He is afraid its depiction of school violence will  further 'glorify' such acts of aggression. <br />The story itself has some  obvious flaws:  the plot is cliched (although, to be fair, school violence  was not as common in 1977); the students in the story do not act  realistically (at least, they didn't act like real students in similar  situations have acted); and at times the dialogue seems wooden (not like  King's modern writing at all).  Still, King was good enough even back then  that you could see some real talent under the surface of the teen angst.   He is a master at turning a situation on its head.  By the end of the  130-page book, I found myself rooting for Charlie, the troubled teen who  kills his teacher and holds his classmates hostage.  And I was solidly  aligned against the forces of good--the cops, the psychiatrists, &amp; the  parents.  On the whole, the book certainly held my interest, and it was  sort of fun looking back and seeing how Stephen King, the most successful  commercial writer of all time, got started.	1999-07-14

A very moving character story	Peter Hedges' novel reminds me a lot of Larry McMurtry's early writings, such as  HORSEMAN, PASS BY and LAST PICTURE SHOW.  Both authors write character-driven books with meandering, sometimes barely discernible plots.   Yet, both are able to weave a cast of quirky characters, slapstick comedic  moments, and old-fashion melodrama into satisfying, touching coming-of-age  stories.  Plus, Hedges' prose  is cleaner, sharper, and funnier.  I can't  count the number of times I laughed out loud while reading this book.  And  the ending was, as one critic put it, &quot;totally luminous&quot;.  It's  hard to explain without ruining the story:  The characters do something  that, logically, doesn't make much sense, but emotionally you know it was  just the right ending--an ending that will lead the characters to a new  beginning.  <br />I gave this book a five-star rating, with one caveat:  If  you like plot-driven stories, rather than character-driven,  you may find  this book drags in places.  <br />Finally, let me say one thing about the  movie, which is about the only publicity this book has  gotten.  The film  is good; it's worth seeing if just to see Leonardo DiCaprio's wonderful  portrayal of Arnie, a young retarded boy.   However, read the book first.   The characters are much better developed, and lots of the great comedy  scenes unfortunately had to be omitted from the film due to time  constraints.   In fact, the movie deals mostly with the last 75 pages of  the book.	1999-07-11

The story is so completely  nonsensical I had a hard time remembering what happened to the characters  ten minutes after I put the book down.  <br />The one redeeming quality of the  book is that it's a very fast read.  Things happen so quickly and the pages  keep turning, so you don't ever think to ask yourself why you're wasting  time reading it.	1999-07-04
US	51754136	R35H9SX949QWFM	0451177096	252564915	Dolores Claiborne	Books	5	2	2	N	N	One of King's best works	I quit reading Stephen King in high school when I &quot;outgrew&quot; (or at least thought I did) horror stories.  But I picked up &quot;Delores Claiborne&quot;  because I heard it was a well-written suspense story  without any monsters, killer clowns, or posessed canines. I was pleasantly  surprised.  The book was as expertly conceived as any &quot;literary  novel&quot;, and it managed to be enthralling and suspenseful at the same  time.  The main character, Delores Claiborne, had a distinctive and  powerful voice (and the whole book was written from her point of view).   When I finished the last page, I was sad to see her go.  King managed to  make her world seem real, populated with complex people, filled with both  humor and tragedy.<br />King certainly has the capability of writing pure  horror best suited to a juvenile audience (Needful Things, Christine, &amp;  Carrie).  But when he's at his best (The Stand, The Shining) is as talented  as any author being published today.	1999-06-27
US	51754136	R2KUAGER8UNI1B	060611761X	752150633	Prentice Alvin (Tales of Alvin Maker)	Books	4	1	6	N	N	Much better than its predecessor	This book has all the trademarks of a good Orson Scott Card book. The story is fast-paced and interesting.  Card's pacing, tone, and voice, as always, is faultless.  The characters are well developed and wholly  believable. They live in the 1800's (well sort of, its an alternate  reality) and unlike many modern-day novels, they don't talk or act as if  they grew up in the 1980's.  They seem genuine.  <br />This book is much  better than its predecessor, RED PROPHET.  There's less hocus-pocus Indian  magic and more character development.  For the first time in the Alvin  Maker series, you feel the saga unfolding over the span of several years.  However, ALVIN PRENTICE cannot stand on its own, and one of the biggest  drawbacks of the book is that you have to read both SEVENTH SON and RED  PROPHET in order to understand it (the first one was good, but the second  one stunk).  <br />And, despite the excellent storytelling, this book is still  a fantasy novel with a nameless, faceless villain (the UNmaker - it sounds  like a bad 7-Up commercial) that hardly inspires fear or anxiety.  I guess  I'm not much of a fan of science fantasy and that's why I can't rank this  series at the top of my list.	1999-06-16

It is interesting and was helpful to my research (I have to get  up to speed with the dynamics of e-commerce because my consulting company  has a client who wants to set up an online auction) site.  Unfortunately, I  cannot recommend this book to other readers.  It was published in 1997;  most of the articles originally appeared in 1996.  As such, about half the  discussion is outdated and not very useful.  I suggest reading something  more current, such as Bruce Judson's HYPERWARS.	1999-06-13

It does not have the grandeur of the Lonesome Dove series, or the poignancy of THE LAST PICTURE SHOW.   However, it does showcase a cast of quirky and  eccentric (if not wholly believable) characters that seem uniquely human.   The plot is interesting and fast-paced.  The story is told from the points  of view of Harmony, an aging Las Vegas showgirl, and her beautiful daughter  Pepper.  The symmetry of their stories--as Harmony's career ends and  Pepper's begins--lends the story a lot of texture and irony.  And McMurtry,  as usual, writes in a strong, compelling voice.<br />But there are some flaws.   First, it is obvious Harmony is supposed to be a more likable character  than Pepper.  McMurtry even refers to Pepper as &quot;a monster&quot; in  his preface to the mass market edition.  However, Pepper is stronger,  smarter, and takes her destiny into her own hands.  I identified with her  much more than her overly optimistic mother.  I have heard that Pepper is  absent from the sequel (THE LATE CHILD).  If that's true, I'll probably  skip it.  <br />Second, there is a LOT of sex in this book.  This is not  unusual for McMurtry's novels, but unlike in LAST PICTURE SHOW and  TEXASVILLE, it adds nothing to the story.  Much of it was thrown in simply  for the sake of vulgarity and titillation.  <br />Finally, the book could have  benefitted from another go-round with the editor.  There is a big timing  descrepancy in Part I (told from Harmony's point of view) and Part II (told  from Pepper's point of view).  In Part I, we learn of an important  breakfast conversation between the women about Pepper's future.  However,  when the events are retold in Part II, the conversation is left out--and  there are no time gaps during which it could have occured.  This is a small  flaw, but an annoying one (I have a pet peeve against sloppy  editing).<br />Flaws notwithstanding, the story was fun (and short).  I've  definitely read worse.	1999-06-07

In fact I can count the number of science fiction authors I've read in the  past ten years on one hand.  I went through a period in high school when I  read a lot of Isaac Asimov, and I read a few Larry Niven novels.  But other  than that, the only science fiction I've been exposed to has come from  Orson Scott Card, who has become one of my favorite authors in many genres.   <br />This is a collection of 18 stories by prominent science fiction authors  in the 1980's.  Before reading this book, I hadn't even heard of most of  them.  Honestly, I expected it to be similar to some of Isaac Asimov's  anthologies, where there is usually one or two good stories and a whole lot  of mediocre ones.  But Card really surprised me.  <br />Out of 18 stories, two  of them rank up there with some of my favorite short stories of all time  (S.C. Syke's &quot;Rockabye Baby&quot; and Orson Scott Card's &quot;The  Fringe&quot; -- both of which, ironically, dealt with severely handicapped  characters).  <br />Almost all the others were also much better than I  expected, especially George Martin's &quot;Portraits of His Children&quot;,  Octavia Butler's &quot;Speech Sounds&quot;, and John Crowley's  &quot;Snow&quot;.  <br />Unfortunately, as is the case in most anthologies,  there were also two real stinkers in the book:  Asimov's uninspired  &quot;Robot Dreams&quot; and Lisa Goldstein's &quot;Tourists&quot;. <br />One  the whole, however, I'd heartily recommend this book one to any fan of  science fiction, but also to any open-minded reader who enjoys  character-driven fiction with a twist of the imaginative.<br />Orson Scott  Card has also edited other anthologies, including FUTURE ON FIRE (1980 - a  companion volume), TURNING HEARTS (1994), DRAGONS OF LIGHT (1980), and  DRAGONS OF DARKNESS (1981).  He also had a small role in co-editing BLACK  MIST AND OTHER JAPANESE FUTURES with two other authors.	1999-05-28

It is lavishly illustrated with artwork and is an exhaustive reference source.   The author states upfront that, for purposes of study, he considers any  literature written before the time of Thomas Malory's LE MORTE D'ARTHUR to  be fair game and part of &quot;authentic&quot; Arthurian lore.  Anything  after Malory is either a modernization or a retelling of the original  legends.  Therefore, references to works such as Tennyson's IDYLLS OF THE  KING and White's ONCE AND FUTURE KING are omitted.<br />This book is wonderful  reference material.  It alludes to many obscure source materials and  attempts to explain the origin of many elements of the stories of Arthur  and the Round Table.  However, I would not recommend it for novice fans.  Coghlan takes it for granted that most of the stories are familiar, and he  spends most of his time explaining how the stories originated, how they  were altered over time, and why inconsistencies exist.  The format of the  book makes it useful for looking up a particular name but not for browsing  through a chronology of the tales.  <br />This book is for the scholars and  historians, not necessarily the readers and dreamers.	1999-05-14

It contains an A to Z listing of Mormon vocabulary with some funny and irreverent definitions.  Modeled after Ambrose Bierce's DEVIL'S  DICTIONARY, it is (as Card puts it) a &quot;satirical but gently  affirming&quot; book about Mormons, their faith, and their lifestyle. It  was written by a Mormon for a Mormon audience.  Frankly, I think I missed a  lot of the humor since I'm not part of the in-crowd.  Some of it, though, I  did relate to since my father was a Presbyterian minister, and I spent a  lot of my childhood around people from my church.  However, if I had been a  non-churchgoer, I don't think I would have had a clue as to what the book  was talking about most of the time.  <br />It's worth the  money if you are (a) a fanatical Orson Scott Card fan, or (b)a Mormon with  a stout sense of humor. Perhaps the book's greatest value is that it  inspired Card to create his own publishing company--Hatrack River--and to  begin writing religious fiction.	1999-05-07
