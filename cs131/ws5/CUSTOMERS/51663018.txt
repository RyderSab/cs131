US	51663018	R6A9JM62X8FJS	0441005969	950318092	Riddle-Master	Books	5	2	2	N	N	I agree, the best of the genre	When I first attempted to read this trilogy I got about 30 pages into it and put it down.  The brother and sister argueing down on the farm just didn't draw me in.  But luckily for me, I decided to give it another chance a few days later.<br /><br />I have never read anything like it.  After the first 30-40 pages the first book is like being on a ride of \\"wonder.\\"  Everything you see is fascinating and although you want to know the \\"secrets\\" you really don't want to get to the end.<br /><br />The change of perspective in the second book is the most creative technique I've seen in fantasy writing.  Once again at first I was almost put off, but loved the first book so much that I pressed right on and quickly became enamored of the second story teller.<br /><br />The third book and payoff sometimes can be a let down after a great buildup.  Not in this story.  It builds to a great cresendo and delivers a mighty payoff that in no way disappoints.<br /><br />Great writing Ms. McKillip!  Thanks for a wonderful journey that I've enjoyed several times over the years and probably will reread again soon.	2005-02-19
US	51663018	RWV52R5X3IR5W	0306811049	886878439	Memoirs Of A Mangy Lover	Books	5	5	7	N	N	I read this when I was 15	and as far as I remember, this was the first book I read that made me laugh out loud.  Prior to this I had only seen Groucho on reruns of his game show and really didn't see the big deal.<br /><br />This book made me start watching his movies and truely appreciating the man.  Later I rewatched the gameshow (can't remember the name of it now, just remember that duck with the word of the day hanging from above) and caught more of Groucho's subtle ribbing of guests.<br /><br />I enjoyed the jokes in this book, as well as, the true affection for his brothers that can be read in between the lines.	2005-01-04

Although I love vampire series, because the cover art made me think it was very slanted towards being a romance novel with just a little vampiric story thrown in.<br /><br />A friend recommended the series to me, recently, and described it and it sounded much more exciting.  She was right.  Many stories of this type have some exciting vampiric action and then some long lulls of description or more dull events thrown in the middle before getting back to more action.  This story is more similar to the first Indiana Jones movie.  Where the story never lulls.  The action never lulls.  And the tension is kept up from the first page til the last.<br /><br />Good read.  Look forward to reading the rest of the series.	2004-12-28
US	51663018	R3BO49H16E4D7	0399152326	488819459	The Runes of the Earth (Last Chronicles of Thomas Covenant)	Books	3	2	5	N	N	Thanks Mr. Donaldson for giving us more of The Land	I struggled with what to rate this book.  All of the first 2 series I rated either 4 or 5 stars.  By rating this 3 stars I feared that I would be sending the message that this book is a dissapointment and it is nothing of the kind.<br /><br />I think I am struggling with the loss of wonder in the land due to The Masters and Kevin's Dirt.  I felt the same way when I first read The Wounded Land, but on rereading later, raised its rating so perhaps I'll end up doing the same for this book after the series is complete.<br /><br />What I liked about it:<br /><br />More indepth treatments of creatures that weren't covered as deeply in the first two series.<br /><br />-The Ramen<br /><br />-The Ranyhan<br /><br />-The urViles<br /><br />-even more indepth treatment of the Haruchai<br /><br />And new interesting new characters like<br /><br />-Anele<br /><br />-Esmer<br /><br />I thought I would really miss Thomas Covenant himself, but Linden Avery is a very worthy successor.  I resisted her in the Wounded Land but by The One Tree she had already won my heart.<br /><br />I've always felt like Thomas C. was the most approachable hero I've ever read.  Very easy to identify him.  A great creation by Donaldson.  Look forward to the next three books!	2004-12-17
US	51663018	RCD232VGTPOO4	0671042858	321732450	The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Better than expected	When I picked up this book to read, I would have guessed that I would end up rating it 2 stars. At most 3.<br /><br />The surprise for me was that Tricia McFarland would not be the average spoiled brat that most child stories center around but a very interesting person who I would come to deeply care about. That's the mark of a great writer in my book.<br /><br />I had always thought this was SK's attempt at how he would do The Blair Witch Project. This story couldn't be further from that other one though. It's a story about strength, and determination, about perservering, and how brave the human spirit can be.<br /><br />If you get a chance, don't miss this one like I almost did. I took me what, 5 years to give it a chance.<br /><br />I listened to the CD-Audio version read by Anne Heicht. I've never been an Ann fan. I thought she tried to get by on gimics more than acting ability. Watching her on Ally McBeal began to change my opinion. Hearing her read this has at least convinced me that \\"Anne, you can read me a story anytime!\\" Excellent capture of Tricia and the voices in her head.	2004-10-30
US	51663018	R3ES1E5PYFPEN	1582344167	481973042	Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell	Books	2	22	27	N	Y	I believed the hype	Hearing the book of the year and Harry Potter for adults tags, I grabbed this book with a lot of expectations.  I've seen other glowing reviews here so I assume this is a case of YMMV (your mileage may vary).<br /><br />The old style of writing didn't put me off.  But I think this could have been a good (but not great) 200-300 page story.  The book set up an interesting premise and contained some interesting sequence.  But inbetween is a lot of rambling.<br /><br />The footnotes remind of of Book of Leaves where the first 50 pages or so they come off as an interesting unique devise but by the 400-700 pages I began to find them very tiresome.  If you have a two page footnote, maybe that story should be part of the main storyline.<br /><br />As someone else said, don't expect Harry Potter for adults.  It is definitely not that.	2004-10-10

Although I rated it the same as The Scar, I consider it just slightly less interesting.<br /><br />BTW, does anyone know of a website that contains a map of Bas-Lag?  I know only New Crobuzon has been included in the first book.  Would love to see anyone's attempt at showing more of Bas-Lag.<br /><br />This book continues the pattern set forth in the first two Bas-Lag books.  The settings and world is a more likeable and interesting character than any of the people in the book.  Mieville is the first author I've read that can get me interested in his stories even though I don't like any of the characters and can't really get into rooting for any of them to overcome their crisis.<br /><br />The idea of Golem magic.<br /><br />The idea of society following a train and laying tracks as they go<br /><br />The idea of the Cacotopic stain area<br /><br />The city of New Crobuzon and all its different, unique areas and societies.<br /><br />The idea of the monks of the Moments<br /><br />These are what hold my interest.	2004-09-13

Good characters and creatures.  But way too many plodding sections for my tastes.  Reminds me of the Soldier in the Mists/Arete books.  If you enjoyed that style you will probably enjoy this one.<br />For me, not as tightly written as the New Sun/Long Sun/Short Sun books.  Those always had me on the edge of my seat.	2004-02-07

US	51663018	R33QUNLHJG7TRN	0345459407	981903971	Perdido Street Station	Books	5	2	5	N	N	Masterfull Writer	It's always nice to find another reliable scifi author.  I enjoyed King Rat very much so dove right into Perdido Street Station after finishing it.  Great read!<br />As others have said, the city is the star of the book.  New Crobuzon is a fascinating place with fascinating &quot;species&quot; (although all the species are really humans).<br />When I see a book about a new &quot;world&quot; with a very complex map at the beginning, I prepare myself to be overwhelmed with learning the different peoples and places of that world.  But Mieville never made me feel uncomfortable.  He writes so fluidly and is so easy and enjoyable to read, that I was able to relax and let him slowly introduce me to the peoples and places.  I never felt like info dump overload.<br />Another mark I give to Mieville is that usually I need to like at least one character in a book strongly, and be able to identify with them and want them to &quot;win&quot;.  But in this book I would find myself filled with a great desire for the &quot;good guys&quot; to win, but then would think, &quot;Wait.  Who are the good guys?&quot;  I didn't particularly like any of the characters.  Didn't dislike them, just didn't identify with them.  It was the city of Crobuzon that I found myself rooting for.  And whether it was a man, a garuda, a vodynoia, a weaver, rebels, militia, handlings, etc.  I found I was rooting for &quot;the city&quot; to survive and win.<br />On the one hand I would like to know more about:<br />deamons<br />weavers<br />vodynoa society including undines<br />the forrest<br />the southlands<br />On the other hand I admire an author that can write a great work without turning it into endless sequels that lose more and more of the wonder as they go on.  So not sure if I want China to write a sequel or not.<br />True scifi fans will definitely enjoy this one.  Reminds me of when I discovered Hyperion by Dan Simmons in 1990.  Something unique and wonderful.	2003-10-05

I noticed King Rat and although I had not heard anything about it, I recently read Neverwhere and enjoyed it.  Since this book seemed to have a similar theme and setting I took a chance on it.<br />Great read!<br />The story was drawing me in, anyway, but once it revealed that it was a dark retelling of a myth, I knew I was hooked.  I've always enjoyed stories that either purport to tell you the *real* story behind the myth, or attempt to bring characters from a myth into modern times.<br />Great characters.  The three kings were very well done.  The Piper was one of the best villians I've read.  Saul seemed to avoid feeling cliche-ish as he &quot;comes of age&quot;.<br />Can't wait to check out more Mieville.	2003-08-29

Wish she would write more like this	I was actually hoping the movie Stargate would be based on this book, and although I enjoyed the movie and series, would have enjoyed it much more if it *had* been based on this great book.<br />I read this back in the 80s when I received it as a selection of the Science Fiction Book Club.  Very engaging story.  It draws you into the characters and they stay with you many, many years afterwards.<br />Good story of just what is good, what is evil and how do we go about living our lives with what we learn about good and evil.<br />Would love to reread this one, if I could find it.	2003-04-03

I was amazed that a book written in that common language style of the 40s would fit in very well with the language many teens use today.  Almost undated at all.  Only in his outward respect to elders which today's cynical kids don't display.<br />My problem with the novel is the humor and freshness wears thin after about 80-90 pages.  I think this novel could have been half the length and would have been much more effective.	2002-05-03

Refugee was one of the most affecting/haunting books I've ever read.  It is not for the weak stomached.  There is much violence in this book, but it's not about the violence it's about the human will to survive. The first four books in this series, Refugee, Mercenary, Politican and Executive are excellent page turners.  The fifth Statesman is good but not quite the same level, a little anticlimatic.  But don't miss out by not reading at least the first four!	2000-12-09

On retrospect I would agree.  This book continues Horn's story and adventures on the planet Blue.  What I like about Wolfe is that from any point in time you not only go forward but  backward.  As he reveals Horn's future we continue to learn more and more  about his past.  What we thought we already read and understood in the Long  Sun books is further explained, questioned and explored.  Like peeling the  layers of an onion Wolfe keeps us hooked looking towards the future and the  past.<br />I am currently reading In Green's Jungles and can't wait for Return  to the Whorl.  Once finished I'll probably go all the way back to the Book  of the New Sun and reread all three series in order.  You can never reread  Wolfe enough.  You will always find more nuggets.	2000-07-22
