The main problem is that much of this history is a mixture of hearsay, misdirection, and out and out lies told by men who liked a good story better than reality. In order to make some sense of the whole thing an author would need some incredible resources. Jones tries to work around this limitation by focusing most of his energy around the creation of Superman by two fairly naive young men out of Cleveland, Ohio. The problem here is still the same; the men involved were not the greatest sources when alive and most of the information comes through hearsay and retellings of stories that seem a bit too pat. For the uninitiated, there are some interesting insights and history to be found here, but for those familiar with the industry, most of the stories will be very familiar.  <br /> <br />When Jones strays from his central concern of Siegel and Shuster's struggles the book actually becomes a more enjoyable read. Jack Kirby and his anger fueled imagination, Steve Ditko's intensity, and other visionaries of the times make fleeting appearances and I often found myself wishing that Jones had decided to investigate any of these other individuals' lives and contributions to the industry. This could serve as a readable and enjoyable entry to understanding where the industry came from, but I really think the truth will never really be uncovered; unlike many historical figures, these men didn't have any idea what they were doing would be examined for posterity. They were just making comics. Bless their hearts. <br />	2005-10-12

That usually works to the detriment of a series like this one where the byplay between Nero and Archie is the real reason for this series success; however, the stories in this collection are at least interesting diversions, if not as satisfying as the novels. <br />\\"The Gun with Wings\\" is a \\"locked room\\" mystery with a rather familiar \\"Gideon Fell\\" feel to it; and \\"Bullet for One\\" has more than its fair share of annoying characters, a fairly forgettable plot, but is slightly redeemed by memorable scene in an office where a Marx Brothers style romp occurs with Archie as a bemused bystander. <br />The winner here is \\"Disguise for Murder\\" which proves to be a lot of fun. Wolfe's aversion to disturbance in his household is overshadowed by his love of showing off his orchids. This proves to be a huge problem as murder occurs in his office, and then the unthinkable happens: Inspector Cramer shuts down Wolfe's sanctuary as a crime scene. Wolfe in high dudgeon is always a treat and the added attraction of Archie in jeopardy ranks this with the best of the Wolfe tales. One classic and two also rans make this a acceptable deal and CURTAINS FOR THREE with your time.  <br />	2005-10-10

What he ends up with is a variety of veiled threats from police hierarchy and the feds to lay off, which of course, just pushes him further into the investigation. As Bosch continues his digging the reader begins to perceive that what seems to be a promising storyline ends up being fairly predictable tale of greed and revenge with innocents caught in the middle. For a number of other writers this would have been good work but for Connelly it comes off as more than a little disappointing. It was nowhere near as emotionally involving as the other Bosch novels I've read; it comes off a bit perfunctory. There is a major surprise in Bosch's personal life revealed within, but even that comes off as anti-climactic. It's three stars because even bad Connelly is better than most, it is always readable and entertaining but it isn't up to par. <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

Whenever Wolfe leaves the office, bad things are bound to happen, but having to go to a fashion designer's workplace, albeit at the request of some of NY's top orchid growers, to investigate a murder, makes Wolfe more than a little grumpy and things go from bad to worse.  As this is an early Wolfe mystery fans will find a few things not in line with the later more polished work; Archie lacks the sophistication we see later in the series and there is particularly unfortunate episode of police brutality that accepted as par for the course by all parties involved. But it is a good mystery with a few more twists than some of the more formulaic Wolfe stories. <br />	2005-10-10

Images from the silver screen and TV mix with insights into life; reflections of today as seen through the slightly skewed perception of Hollywood creating images ingrained in our imaginations and unleashed for inspection through Trowbridge's insight. Stan and Ollie cavort as representatives of sex and anger confronted by authority; the \\"magma landscape\\" of the shoe exhibit at the Holocaust museum, and Michael's kiss of death for his brother Fredo are some of the images that Trowbridge uses as a base for his word play. <br />There are also a number of trips into Trowbridge's personal life, childhood remembrances and painfully examined relationships with aged parents that allow you into the true wonder of what well written poetry can accomplish; a truth and emotion that only poetry can convey. <br />The only misfires here are the series of poems featuring The Glad's, a sort of pseudo suburban family that seems more than a bit heavy handed in its attempt at satire.

Haunted by memories of his father whose ghost he sees everywhere, Tim is adrift in life lacking direction or focus. His situation changes suddenly when he is confronted with the body of a young girl and then the peril of another. This leads him to combat a societal evil that will prove all too obvious to a 21st century reader, but one whose impact is still horrifying by its mere existence.<br /><br />Tim is unsure of himself but driven to confront the evil placed before him, despite lacking the basic tools to combat it effectively. Teamed with a street urchin of with amazing survival skills and a young girl whose will belies her size and age, Tim Cratchit rises to the occasion and faces his fears, both physical and psychological.<br /><br /> . By placing A CHRISTMAS CAROL's characters in a setting more befitting one of Dickens more dramatic works and, in essence, making them more real,  Bayard has not truly succeeded in capturing the nature of those characters. It is a decent mystery and one that captures the time well, but the central conceit of having Tiny Tim grow into this \\"lost soul\\" adrift in the world just didn't work for me. I found the future that Bayard has created for Dickens's Cratchit family and the old miser was wanting.	2005-10-07

Wolfe's involvement in a case relating to the civil rights movement, interracial relationships, and of course, a murder that will confound the police, is an interesting time capsule. The book exposes some harsh truths which appear a bit dated today, but don't lack for impact. The mystery itself is a fairly involving one, but the weight of the events surrounding this particular tale is a bit too heavy for Nero and Archie to carry. Stout was not afraid to make political statements in this series, but they didn't always make for the best episodes.	2005-09-30

The saving grace for this work is that the author of the aforementioned diary is one of the great comic minds behind Monty Python and The Rutles. On tour, reprising some of Python's greatest hits, Idle hits upon the idea of sharing his thoughts with his pythononline audience. What follows is surprisingly personal and often very funny memoir.There are wonderful stories here, ranging from the day to day life of Idle and his merry band of players, their trials and tribulations of touring across the states and Canada, Python reminiscences, touching stories of Idle the husband and father and a number of great stories of his friend, George Harrison. There are a few political tirades, some very funny stories and a general feeling of good will towards his fans that was nice to read. I was amazed that Idle was willing to share so much and was impressed with his candor. The book does suffer from its original source; the repetition of a number of stories is fine for an online diary but definitely should have been edited out of a book. But this is a minor knock against a book that should satisfy any Python fans or those who like a well-written memoir about life on the road.	2005-09-30

Hopelessly romantic, he marries a woman incapable of responding in kind. Pursuing his father's love and acceptance, he's rejected. And then he agrees to give Satan seven sessions of analysis. Things continue to go downhill from there. Leven's book is an interesting mixture of guilt, suffering and comedy, not entirely successfully blended together, but it does have its moments.  Psychology and its many different disciplines takes a beating here as does the legal system and religion, but by taking on so many \\"sacred cows\\" Leven dilutes the message. So many scenes are so far over the top that it becomes hard to take anything seriously and there are enough deaths and lives destroyed that this hurts the book's tone. Kassler ends up being so useless that it is difficult to find sympathy for him, but the scenes where he is shown with his kids are truly moving. The ending is the most disappointing part of the journey where elements of horror are introduced that seem out of place as if the there was nowhere else to go, and revelations about some of the characters seem forced. Despite these flaws, SATAN does raise a variety of intriguing ideas and is worth a look.	2005-08-26

Rowling stays true to her vision here and other than some unfortunate \\"snogging\\" scenes which are, of course, an example of life goes on in spite of the horror, but they are poorly written, serving as an afterthought and lacking in real emotion.

Despite the fact that this really is an atypical case for Wolfe, it is accepted with the caveat that Wolfe merely has to prove Rony unsuitable for Bascom's daughter. This leads into one of the more pointless Wolfe outings. Dated references (the \\"red menace\\" angle just does not hold up very well.), an overly convoluted plot, and more than a few dangling threads make this one of Stout's weakest tales. The only real reason for making this an important read for Wolfe fans is the presence of Zeck, who precedes to destroy the plant rooms in retaliation for Wolfe's involvement in his affairs. This will lead to the final showdown between Zeck and Wolfe. (THE BEST OF FAMILIES) For that reason alone, this is an important part of the Wolfe canon, but as a mystery it falls far short of the excellence of much of the rest of this series.	2005-08-08

This mystery has Archie showing how successful he would be as a solo operator and Wolfe pulling off one of his most outrageous gambits, leading to a final showdown that stunned me the first time I read it because of its distance from the regular \\"Wolfe's office wrap up.\\" The original murder investigation itself rewards the reader; the mystery is solvable by a reader who carefully examines the facts; it's always fun when the writer plays fairly, something Stout didn't often do.

He is being passed over for promotion at the post office, he has intimacy issues with his girl and he is fixated on Ernest Hemingway. These factors combine together to make a novel that begins with a humorous tale of man versus unwanted progress and becomes a darker tale of a man losing himself in Hemingway, or as the author would have it, finding himself. I was disheartened by Martin's transformation from an unsure individual to one who uses Hemmingway as a crutch to some better existence. I doubt this was Palin's intent, but this novel left me cold with its eventual transformation. I found it very heavy handed and lacking the deft touch that I have found in Palin's non-fiction works. I enjoyed the early scenes of the novel with its look at the slightly bizarre lives in this small British town , but as the novel moves forward it becomes involved in far too much soul searching and tries to be something more meaningful than its beginnings allow. The change is merely jarring, rather than enlightening.   <br />	2005-08-03

Hester is involved in a nursing matter of her own dealing with a soldier who is horrifically injured and the difficulty he and his wife are having dealing with this condition. But the matter she is dealing with leads to a mystery as well and Monk once again becomes embroiled in a matter which seems to lead to no easy solution.<br /><br />This is my first Anne Perry book and I was impressed by her ability to handle characters. They are well-drawn and convey real emotion towards each other in the way that characters in all excellent series do. The mysteries involved, while not entirely original are well-structured and although the central mystery takes far too long to be revealed the author generally plays fairly with the readers. I was a little surprised by the rather modern sensibilities that many of characters take towards Victorian morality, it seems odd that all the characters with these beliefs are portrayed sympathetically and all others are without any redeeming qualities, but this is a central point in this book. Perhaps this was not the best choice to start reading the \\"William Monk\\" series, but I was intrigued enough to give the series another shot.	2005-08-02

This one has a nice balance of the usual Wolfe conventions, Archie's efforts to needle and thus motivated Wolfe, plenty of red herrings to confuse the issues, and Wolfe pulling off one of his better stunts to wrap up the case. One of the better scenes is when Wolfe actually tries the beverage that conveyed the poison; you can picture Wolfe's face as he is confronted with the \\"pop\\" in question.  There is also the introduction of the character who will prove to be Wolfe's Moriarty, Arnold Zeck, whose disembodied voice on the phone lends a share of menace rarely found in Nero Wolfe tales.

Not being an avid birdwatcher I thought The Audobon Society would be the place to look, but I found this guide to be just OK. Separating the photos from the descriptions is more than a little annoying, and the photos themselves only show one angle so identification for the novice is often dependent upon seeing the bird from the correct angle.

The ability of Yann Martel to keep this story of a boy and a tiger on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean fascinating and plausible is nothing short of amazing. This examination of what it takes to survive, both physically and mentally in the direst of circumstances, might make this novel a welcome addition to the \\"tales of survival genre,\\" but that does not do the book justice. Only a great work of fiction is able to present so many concepts worthy of examination, questions on the nature of life, faith, and what makes us human. There are so many concepts and ideas addressed in these pages, from beginning to end, that the book is much more than a tale of survival; it is a tale that captures the essence of what it is to be human. <br />	2005-07-28

Along comes Johnathan Strange, who is everything Norrell is not, even tempered, congenial and in possesion of a sense of humor. At first Strange becomes Norrell's pupil and after a difference of opinion over the future of magic his foe.Behind the scenes a member of Fairie is creating problems that will lead to climactic scenes of magic and a satisfying tying together of the various subplots in this novel. At almost 800 pages the novel does occasionally get bogged down in all the details that Clarke puts in and occasionally the footnotes are of little value, (Ex: Hexenmeister is German for magician. The context easily answered this without a footnote.)but overall this is a fine addition to the world of fantasy fiction.	2005-06-25

This journey into Hendra's life, his attraction to the monastic life, his time with the Lampoon, and even his inability to be a successful father are all faced with the aid of his moral compass, Father Joe. Occasionally the book lapses a bit into the self serving particularly like when discussing \\"Splitting Image,\\"(Just a bit too much vitriol there) but the overall effect is that of one man's profoundly moving spiritual journey.

When I read A YEAR IN THE MAINE WOODS, I was intrigued by Heinrich's examinations of the natural world, but found myself occasionally bored by his writing style; and THE GEESE OF BEAVER BOG suffers from a similar fate. Heinrich has a tendency to focus on the mundane, details like the time and date are used over and over, appropriate perhaps for a journal, but tedious in this setting. His personal connection to the geese is endearing, and the examination of the behavior of nesting geese is often fascinating, but I still found my mind wandering as the general dryness of the descriptions just becomes a bit tedious.

Rebus, with his inability to let things remain status quo, proves to be an excellent protagonist, his interest in music a nice trait and his heavy drinking understandable given his sense of isolation. Scotland as a setting proved to be fascinating for this American reader and the police procedural nature of the book is well-served by Rankin's attention to detail. But I did find there was a bit too much going on , an old case coming back to haunt Rebus, two serial killers, a murder that involves big oil and big crime, and one of those unresolved endings that really could have been resolved without any great difficulty. This was just too many threads to tie together successfully, but in away I like the idea that Rankin feels the need to challenge the reader within the confines of this type of mystery. I'll definitely give Inspector Rebus another look.	2005-03-10

Most of the stuff is nonsense but it still adds up to a fun read.

Surviving a childhood of neglectful and deranged parents, moving to an environment where the concept of normal does not apply, Burroughs creates a vivid picture of the bizarre world of his childhood. The basic problem is that as you read it the individual epsisodes start to blend together; you start to guess where the narrative is going because at a certain point the element of surprise is lost, and you  can no longer be shocked by each and every incident. There is humor to be found here as well, but it is mired in misery. I'm glad Burroughs was able to convert these horriffic experiences into a successful book, but I don't know if I would care to read any further tales of his youth.	2005-03-10

Now a whole book featuring McBain's least likeable character, Ollie Weeks. Fat Ollie's written a book and during the investigation of a mayoral candidate's murder someone steals it from Ollie's car. now the hunt is on. The murder case is pushed to the back burner as we are punished with excerpts from Ollie's book, Ollie in lust,and meeting someone even more loathsome than Ollie, his snitch the pederast Fats Donner. Enough already! Coupled with a fairly simplistic mystery, this book is McBain at his weakest, scattered and barely able to hold the interest of the reader.	2005-02-22

Kaplan does an admirable job working to heal this dichotomy; he sticks to focusing on Clemens the man, with all his qualities for good or ill. Kaplan does fine work developing the reader's understanding of how Twain's early years of wandering created the necessity of Twain the writer. The gradual evolution of Mark Twain is an interesting and at times riveting tale and Kaplan supplies all the details needed to experience this transition. As Twain ages and his focus shifts from writing to his pursuit of financial success at the level of America's richest men, Kaplan maintains his ability to tell Twain's story in an interesting fashion, but Twain's life becomes less interesting. Bogged down in bad business decisions and family health issues Twain becomes someone the reader will find less patience with. Kaplan does have some difficulty here, with choices that occasionally lead to judgmental writing. Phrases like \\"his flawed best,\\" \\"He would shamelessly upstage anyone,\\" and mentions of his self-centered nature and megalomania make their appearances periodically. Kaplan is particularly harsh when considering Twain in his final years when his daughter's influence was significant on an old man who was ill and afraid of losing any more family. But there is an overall sense that Kaplan is just showing an actuality based on his research. <br />The book does come up a little short when discussing Twain's literary output. Kaplan makes judgments on what was significant, but there definitely needed to be a more complete look at Twain's output and discussion of the literary merits of his work. It may have added a number of pages to the work, but I felt twain's work needed a closer examination, perhaps at the expense of some of the financial minutiae of Twain's bad business decisions. Overall Kaplan does an excellent job of examining Twain the man; I just wish a bit more time had been spent on Twain the writer. <br />	2005-02-22

Patrick McGilligan does a good job of examining Nicholson's early career, his work from the late fifties to the early 70's is discussed with insight and detail. The early chapters show a young man searching for his role in an industry he desperately wanted to be part of; and McGilligan focusses on Nicholson's attempt to create a role for himself in Hollywood. You definitely get the feeling that McGilligan had much more access to the people in Jack's life from this time period. <br /> But as Nicholson becomes more famous, McGilligan's work seems to lose focus,and as Nicholson became more circumspect when dealing with the media, McGilligan's sources of info seem to dry up. Writing a biography of a living person without access to them in some way will always cause a bio to have a distance that only the best writers can overcome. McGilligan is not able to overcome this deficit and the book becomes tedious as it progresses to repeated mentions of Nicholson's less than ordinary formative years as the child of a woman he grew up believing to be his sister and their presumed affect on his work and relationships. This is a focus for McGilligan as he tries in some way to gain some kind of psychoanalytic understanding of Nicholson and the book bogs down under the weight of these constant asides. By the time the book reaches its end in 1992, I was thoroughly bored with McGilligan's take on what really should have proven to be an interesting life.	2005-01-23

As such, they serve their purpose, yet they really never come to life. They live in such a controlled environment that they seem to function more like experiments than actual people; DeLillo makes his points but his creations never achieve an existence that will capture the reader. What will fascinate is how prescient DeLillo is and how well he is able to capture so many truths about America. It is just a shame he didn't decide to do it with characters that might possibly have existed in the real world.	2004-10-06

AN EXPERIMENT IN TREASON is a rather weak addition to this fine series. Basing the case on actual historical events involving Franklin and some rather interesting letters that became available for public consumption in the states; Alexander had a good idea, but the execution is lacking. Franklin comes off as a caracature of himself, a bit of an old lech, (which he may have been but I believe he may have been a bit more circumspect in an unfamiliar environment like Sir John's home.)who was rather lacking in the wit or the intellect that is so celebrated in many of his biographies. Even the tales involving Sir John's household were particularly weak, involving an unfortunate return of Lady Fielding's son from the navy. While I appear to be in the minority on this one; I feel this book is lacking the quality of mystery and character development that is the norm for Alexander's generally excellent historical mysteries.	2004-09-22

For those who are wondering, WEIRD NJ is a magazine and website that spends its time and effort investigating (well, investigating is probably to strong a word) the strange happenings, people, and places of the Garden State. Poorly written letters, second hand tales of haunted sites and all manners of the bizarre are contained in the pages of each issue. I was hoping the book would be a bit more professional in its presentation and research. One out of two isn't bad.  <br />The book looks great.Well-illustrated with a variety of excellent photos and artwork, the book immediately catches your eye. Breaking the book into sections is a nice touch, from Local Legends to Bizarre Beasts (Go, Jersey Devil)the book covers a lot of territory. <br />Of course how the territory is covered is the real problem. Stories that begin \\"My friends and I went to,\\" \\"I know someone who knows,\\" \\"I grew up in ,\\" all must be taken with far more than a grain of salt. So much is \\"reported\\" here without any documentation that the stories that are based in reality get mixed with the tall tales to create a less than satisfying mixture. The charm of the cheesy magazine cannot take the glaring light of scepticism when blow up into book format, but if you can let that go and just enjoy the sheer wackiness of it all, you'll have a good time.	2004-09-21

It brought the U.S. to the forefront of world events and showed the willingness of Americans to defend their rights on the world stage. Nevin applies his knowledge of the event and its participants to the task of explaining the war's importance with mixed results. James Madison and his wife Dolly come off well as Nevein shows \\"Little Jimmy's\\" rising to the occasion bolstered by Dolly's fierce and loving determination. Winfield Scott comes to the forefront as a soldier who changes the way the U.S. looks at tactics, but serves, oddly, as a love interest for an imaginary character. Andrew Jackson gets a bit too much time as the raging lunatic who is calmed by his wife's gentle influence. I don't find fault so much with the presentation of Jackson as it took away from Madison and Dolly, who I found to be the more intriguing pair. <br />   That being said, it is the battle scenes that really make this book one of interest. New Orleans has been discussed a multitude of times but Nevin makes it fresh and the battles on the Niagra frontier were vividly presented. Here Niven's obviously strong research truly comes to light. 1812 may be a novel but it is one of excellent insight, occasionally plagued by melodrama, but worth the time of any fan of this genre. <br />	2004-09-06

I did not read Greenlaw's previous work, but the idea of presenting life on a Maine island, delving into the trials and simple joys of this life, really appealed to me. I wish that was what Greenlaw had done here. Instead I found a series of dull complaints about inept handymen, the lackluster love life of the author, and character sketches that are so lacking in detail that I can't understand why they were included. Chapter after chapter of complaining about the poor season, her father, her poverty, become so tedious that you hope she gets a few lobsters just so she'll stop whining. Even the sections that were more enjoyable, when she's writing about the nuts and bolts of lobster fishing, are written in a style that just lies on the page. There was a great idea here, somewhere, buried under the bad prose.	2004-08-24

A hulking figure who has basically come to the conclusion that he deserves nothing better than a wife who has nothing but contempt for him and an existence that has no real meaning. Events suddenly overtake him and he ends up as a writer on a New Foundland weekly, with his two rather feral children and a house in the middle nowhere. What makes this book so much fun to read is Proulx's vivid characters, who seem to take on a life of their own. What really is a rather basic story of self-discovery becomes a wonderful examination of life on Canada's eastern coast and how life goes on regardless of the circumstances. You start to feel anger at Quoyle's inability to step up and reach out for what life offers, and this to me is high praise. When characters become that real, you know the author's doing her job. While the few twists are not that surprising and the book really ends in a predictable fashion, the characters and the wonderful setting make this a worthwhile read.	2004-08-18

Playing around with the typical conventions of cross channel warfare, identical twins(never a good idea), and a foray into LeCarre territory, a nice thriller emerges. The story does have its flaws with a rather obvious villain and a few too many twists to hold onto the realism that Higgins generally strives for but overall it works its way to its inevitable conclusion effectively. Other than the ridiculous cover on this paperback, as astutuely mentioned by another reviewer-a U-Boat which has nothing to do with this tales of an E-Boat and espionage, this one's a rather nice page turner and not bad for a quick thriller to fill in on the plane trip or at the beach.	2004-08-10

This is the book's problem. Being so much larger than life, Ravelstein's presence overwhelms all the other characters so that they totally disappear into the background. When Ravelstein dies, the book for all intents and purposes ends as an interesting read. It limps along with Chick's own brush with death which just feels tacked on. I am aware that this book has a basis in reality, but it just doesn't hold together well. The character that Bellow has created in Ravelstein; regardless of his origin, deserved better.	2004-08-02

Pearson follows two storylines with the slimmest of connections; his two protagonists are cousins.  The far better of the two tales is that of Ray Tatum, a former city cop who is now a deputy sheriff in Hogarth, Virginia. Trying to put a family tragedy and failed marriage behind him, Ray discovers a body along the Appalachian Trail and with the assistance of a rather fierce Park Ranger from DC; he pursues the trail which leads to one of those places that are very difficult to deal with in a small town. This part of the story feels very authentic to me, the story stretches just far enough to hold your interest and the relationship between Ray and the ranger, Kit just feels very real. The dialogue and settings work exceptionally well.  <br />It's the tale of Ray's cousin, Paul, and his trip to NYC that reads like a bad pulp story. Paul is called in to identify the body of the son he never actually had anything to do with after his original conception. From there Paul becomes involved with a dopey duo of cops, a conniving actress, and a criminal who almost seems omniscient in his portrayal by Pearson. Wasting time with a trip through the seamy side of Manhattan and finishing up with an outrageously ridiculous ending, I couldn't help but wish Pearson had focused all his energies on Ray's tale and left Paul in his notebook; Pearson's dialogue and settings seem to ring much truer in the South. <br /> <br />	2004-08-02

Mary works undercover and with her newly found wealth makes herself a target, with serious consequences. King creates a real sense of menace in this installment and Russell's peril is strongly rendered and will make the reader feel true compassion for her. <br />Holmes's presence is felt throughout the novel, and King does a fine job of staying true to this character, fleshing out some of his personality while never forgetting that he is the \\"world's greatest detective.\\" The eventual match of Russell and Holmes may put some traditionalists out of sorts, but I find it a way to breathe new vitality into this legendary character, and in Mary Russell, King has developed a fine and equal partner for the detective. <br />	2004-08-02

The one big mistake in this otherwise solid addition to the series is the McBain's sorry attempt to create a rap band, in this case one called Spit Shine; a band that is important to the plot but is one more example how many writers are \\"tone deaf\\" to rap.

Anthony Arthur takes an interesting look at how far egos can get out of control in this examination of some LITERARY FEUDS. Some of the feuds have been pretty well-discussed in the past, but Arthur's research and willingness to investigate the causes of these feuds makes for an entertaining read. Each feud here has different set up. Starting with the totally one-sided Twain/Harte debacle and wrapping up with latest major battle involving Wolfe, Updike and Irving, Arthur does a fine job recapping the origins and the outcomes of these literary contretemps. He also examines the works that led to these quarrels with a critical eye that gives the reader added insight into these rather fierce battles. While I feel some of these arguments were tempests in a teapot and I still have never read anything by C.P. Snow or F.R. Leavis (Two of the subjects within), I still feel this book added to my understanding of some of these authors and gave me new appreciation for some of their work.	2004-07-26

This is an enjoyable keepsake for fans of the show, but there is some obvious padding, I mean, 90 pages of illustrated script? The book is only 192 pages long. There are other extras, like the production sheets and Melendez's original backgrounds. They are welcome sights and it would have been nice to see more effort put into details like these.

Hijuelos also presents us with Mr. Ives' great agony; the sensless murder of his son and his desperate attempts to understand it. We see Ives' life in brief glimpses, each time we get a better understanding of the man and the world that he is part of, but he still remains a cipher. It's as if he is not a fully formed person, or perhaps it's the distance that Hijuelos wants to create in this man who does not truly know where he came from. I found this distance to be my great obstacle in liking this book more. Ives is more symbolic of a crisis of faith than he is a human being. I couldn't connect with him even as he was in the throes of anguish. Hijuelos' prose is marvelously readable, he creates a Manhattan that you can feel. Too bad I can't say the same thing for mr.

Having had a single opportunity to attend this (Christopher Walken's Hamlet!) event, I was hoping for some insight and history of the event. Instead, I found out far too much about Smith's problems; of his difficulties coping with a family that was overwhelmed by having a severely disabled child in the home (Smith's sister), and very little about Stratford's festival. Well, shame on me for buying into a blurb, but I still found the book very disappointing. Focusing basically on his youth, and his later contributions to the community by running Shakespeare reading groups at senior centers in NYC, HAMLET'S DRESSER, needs far more Shakespeare. When Shakespeare does appear, the book comes to life. The joy senior citizens get from the reading groups, Smith's fascination with Shakespeare that led to a life immersed in his works, and especially in the sections where Smith discusses the actors he had an opportunity to work with is where this book truly becomes interesting. Katherine Hepburn, June Havoc, and Bert Lahr all make memorable appearances. The chapter where Smith discusses going on tour with Lahr gives the reader a wonderful glimpse into what it is like to work with a talented yet irascible actor on the road with all of its joys and pitfalls. Sadly, there are not enough of these journeys in this book. I feel some empathy for Smith's trials and tribulations, yet they didn't make for interesting reading. The troubled tales of his youth seem better suited to a therapist's office as opposed to a memoir. They truly pale in comparison to his tales of the theater, which when shared with the reader make for some fine storytelling. If the focus had stayed with Shakespeare and the theater I feel this could have been a wonderful book, as it stands it is a flawed a bit boring overall.	2004-06-03

A gang of thieves are ransacking London homes, and the thieves are identified as black men. This throws Sir John into a mystery that has political and social ramifications that only a quick resolution will keep from turning into a major disaster for London's citizens. With an attempt on his life incapacitating him, Sir John turns to his assistant, Jeremy to be the lead investigator on this case. Alexander presents a clever mystery, which portrays a number of this series' regulars in a new light. Even the nature of Sir John and Jeremy's relationship shows some change, allowing Jeremy to show more maturity and giving the reader an intriguing glimpse into what motivates Sir John's gamesmanship. This one is a fine puzzle, which should be enjoyed by any fan of historical mysteries.	2004-06-03

This particular collection is of interest to fans of the JSA because it contains the stories that give Wildcat and Mr. Terrific their memberships. Instead of being forgotten heroes of the forties, their legacies live on because of these brief appearances.  Roy Thomas's intro explains the events leading up to this change in membership clearly. The main problem with this edition is the art. It is of particularly poor quality by lesser lights, with the exception of Joe Kubert's wonderful Hawkman segments, and make the stories appear exceptionally amateurish. It's a shame because the stories themselves are pretty good, especially the one dealing with the heroes being aided by people with disabilities which seems fairly enlightened for the time period. Not some of All-Star Comics finest moments, but has historical value for the comic fan.	2004-06-03

Starting by focusing on John Laroche, a \\"collector\\" who becomes involved some interesting adventures in search of orchids, Orlean shifts gears by giving the reader insight into the history of collecting, orchid shows where the competition is particularly fierce, and finally the dark side of this hobby. Writing in a style that is informative without ever being boring, Orlean succeeds in bringing the reader very close to the innate mania involved in this pursuit of \\"beauty.\\" While I'm sure other hobbies suffer from these manias, THE ORCHID THIEF is a wonderful example of a book that tells how a wonder of the natural world becomes the object of man's covetousness.	2004-06-03

With a clever use of the second person, the reader is welcomed as a co-voyeur into the private world of a prostitute, taking an incredibly personal view into her daily life before we are blithely informed that this character will have no bearing on the rest of the novel. I found this a clever and quirky opening and was hopeful that this tone could be maintained for the duration of this rather lengthy tome. For a time this momentum continues, as we are introduced to William Rackham, the disappointing son of an industrialist, and Sugar the courtesan who is willing to do \\"anything.\\" Infatuated by Sugar, Rackham, through her intervention, becomes a success and takes Sugar as his \\"kept woman.\\" But it is at this point the novel begins to bog down in repetition. Sugar, who is originally writing a secret novel of revenge against men, is now found to be pining away in her furnished rooms, wondering if Rackham will be visiting her; Rackham's wife having one demented episode after another, each one losing its emotional impact as the reader starts to wonder, \\"What is she going to do this time?\\" while continually losing sympathy for this rather poorly drawn character, and finally Rackham's tedious transformation from callous fool to insufferable boor. These activities are presented for page after page until we finish with a predictable and less than satisfying conclusion to these rather sad little lives. I will admit Faber's excellent descriptions and clever dialogue keeps this book readable, but I felt there was a great story here, but it was buried so far under an excess of verbiage that only a mediocre story emerged.	2004-06-02

Beginning with \\"Hunger,\\" where Constantine has to \\"bottle up\\" a demon before it consumes a whole city, the reader is introduced to a man who doesn't fight for heaven or hell, but rather to save mankind from getting caught in between. Using whatever means necessary, including the lives of anyone who is too close to him, Constantine rages against the unfairness of it all. Fueled by Jamie Delano's rage of Britain's and America's system of government and economy, Constantine battles yuppie demons and stands against both the Resurrection Crusaders and the Damnation Army in his hope that man will be allowed to make their own mistakes. However, the art doesn't help tell the story. Ridgeway's work is extremely \\"scratchy\\" and only the addition of Alcala's inks at the end of the collection make things This collection is a bit dated, with its Thatcher references and a connection to the Swamp-Thing series that hampers understanding of all the references, but it is a solid beginning.

By utilizing an incredible grasp of the time period, Fleming creates a very plausible scenario, a plot to kidnap George Washington. Caught between British and American spymasters is Caleb Chandler, a minister, who has lost his faith in face of war's destruction. He finds instead a woman of questionable loyalties and this leads him into a world from which he can find no escape. Filled with double dealing and a gamesmanship usually found LeCarre novels, DREAMS OF GLORY gives the reader of what cloak and dagger was like during America's early years. I did have some difficulty accepting some of the personality transformations different characters undergo, they seem to be more for the purpose of moving the plot along as opposed to having real depth, but the real focus here is on the intrigue and the setting. Fleming makes this combination hard to resist.	2004-01-21

The structure of pure dialogue between the physicists, Heisenberg, Bohr and Bohr's wife Margrethe( who represents the non-physicists in the audience) lends itself to the closer examination the written word gives us. Michael Frayn brilliantly imagines a moment frozen in time- Heisenberg arrives from Germany in 1941 to discuss something with his mentor, Bohr in occupied Copenhagen. Seizing upon this historical event and its mysterious circumstances, Frayn recreates the event from a variety of perspectives in pursuit of  a greater truth. Was Heisenberg a hero, who kept the Nazi's from achieving the ultimate weapon, or a victim of his own carelessness?<BR> Reading the play, gives you the time to reflect upon how creatively Frayn frames each of his scenarios. The dialogue is never less than challenging, even while playing to the audience surrogate, Margrethe. Frayn uses these two great minds to introduce the audience into the realm of advanced physics and the moral ambiguities involved in the mixing of pure science with the nature of war. The forced civility between the two men emphasizes the underlying current of terror created by the Nazis rise to power and the oncoming dawn of an atomic age. Frayn does not offer any easy answers, to do so would be an insult to the wonderful work that has gone on before.<BR> The postscript alone is worth the price of the book for any fan of the play. It sets up the historical context for the play's creation and gives the reader a much greater understanding of where Frayn came up with many of the issues he examines in this work.	2004-01-21

That's the storyline in this JSA collection. The Ultra-Humanite steals the body of Johnny Thunder and then steals the Thunderbolt from its current master, Jakeem. He then proceeds to remake the world in his own warped image. Only a few remaining heroes (and one villain) are still free to stop him. The Johns/Goyer team does a nice job of bringing back Hourman II, who finally outgrows his father's shadow and leads the team into action. The focus on Wildcat is a nice touch as well, as he personifies the \\"tough guy\\" superhero, but most welcome of all is the opportunity to see Jakeem be more than \\"the  angry kid\\" character and become a hero.

Working with some of the top artists in comics, Gaiman focuses on stories that feature each one of his creations with varying degrees of success.<BR>Death- the idea behind this story is an old one: \\"How can someone cheat Death?\\" Gaiman's take on this old chestnut is not really a new one, (In fact, the movie GROUNDHOG DAY comes to mind) but P. Craig Russell's art makes the most of a forgettable tale.<BR>Desire- This is the first Desire story that I feel truly captures the appeal of the character. This story of someone paying the ultimate price for her desire and still believing it was worth it, goes a long way in showing me what Gaiman was trying to convey with this character all along. Milo Manara does a fine job on this story as it plays well to his strength as a storyteller. <BR>Dream- Wonderfully otherworldly art by Prado is a welcome sight on this story. It takes place in the distant past when our sun was young and Gaiman shows long time fans the reason for the animosity between Dream and Desire.<BR>Delirium- Sienkiewicz is at his lunatic best with this trip into Delirium's realm. When Delirium falls too deeply into her own world, Dream and Delirium's faithful dog, Barnabas, collect some denizens of her realm to go in and find her. Gaiman cleverly utilizes Sienkiewicz's inspired illustrations to paint a portrait of what it is like inside the minds of Delerium's charges.<BR>Despair- 15 intuitive portraits of Despair by Barron Storey are used as templates for short pieces by Gaiman allowing the reader to get a glimpse of Despair's realm. Each story is as dark as Storey's art is haunting.<BR>Destruction- This is basically a decent SF story that happens to have Destruction (and Delirium) in it. Their presence is superfluous to this tale of weapons from another time invading our world.<BR>Destiny- Just another stroll through Destiny's garden, albeit with great art by Quitely. One dayGaiman will get around to writing a story with this character, but this isn't it.<br />This collection should satisfy fans of the series, but it lacks the epic scope of Gaiman's Sandman series. But until Gaiman decides that he wants to take another run at his creations this will have to do.	2004-01-21

He decides to return to the last place he was truly happy, their Maine getaway, \\"Sara Laughs.\\" Considering this is a Steven King novel, you know things will start to get weird from this point on. The problem is like much of his recent work, a good idea is crushed under the weight of unnecessary prose.<BR>The book starts out promisingly enough; King presents the reader a terrific glimpse of what happens to a writer when he can't write, his presentation of Noonan's pain over the loss of his wife is brutal to read as it is presented with a great deal of insight, and the tension and fear Noonan feels when he returns to \\"Sara Laughs\\" is definitely showing King at the height of his powers. This set up only makes you crave more.<BR>And that's the problem; \\"The More\\" you get is a mishmash of a custody battle between an evil old man and his hard luck daughter-in-law, a town that has no stand up citizens when confronted by money, and another story of the living paying the price for their ancestors' wicked doings. At three hundred pages this might have been a heart pounding thriller; at 500 you just want it to end. From the ludicrous battle between Noonan and the old man and his far from spry assistant, to the gratuitous death of one of the lead characters (done only for shock value, it is totally unnecessary to the plot) BAG OF BONES just disappoints after the great start.	2004-01-21

Max Mercury and the rest of the DC speed crew (Johnny and Jamie Quick, Impulse, Jay Garrick) help the Flash stop him. Collected from crossovers in Flash and Impulse comics, the art is a distraction. Jumping from Jimenenz (very angular with no real feel of motion) to Ramos (anime styling and definitely not appropriate for this storyline serious nature) is disconcerting and definitely does not improve what is already a weak story. Basically, these stories are an attempt to solidify the importance and attraction of the Speed Force, but serve instead as another opportunity to remove another Golden Age character from the DC landscape. This character's death is like many in the DC universe the past few years, occurring mainly for shock value. If you decide to kill off a hero, (albeit in this case, a minor one) at least let them go out in a blaze of glory, not a whimper. DEAD HEAT is far from the high standard Waid has set on his Flash run; it is needed by completists only.	2004-01-21

That being said, the constant recycling of of material has hit a new low with this collection.

By utilizing Jackson's own writing Burstein examines Jackson as he presented himself to others. This Jackson seems to be a man motivated by his belief that he was right in all things that mattered and if you disagreed you were disloyal. These are probably not uncommon traits for a president who was exceptionally popular, but played fast and loose with the U.S. Constitution and the will of the other branches of government. <BR>That being said by focussing on Jackson's relationships with various individulas in his life, I felt I was not getting a complete portrait. Why was this man so revered by the people and what motivated his his various decisions? I feel this book gave me a starting point in understanding Jackson, a president who I feel abused his position like few others, but there seems to be more of a story here and THE PASSIONS OF ANDREW JACKSON seems to raise as many questions as it answers.	2003-08-28

Virgil Selby starts out as a young man in search of something more than life is offering him. By taking on the identity of a fighter named Kid McCoy and following the advice of a Chinese flim-flam artist named Johnnie Gold; he sets out to make himself into a great man. The real problem is that Virgil's new life is based on a lie and of course it falls apart. Sort of a rags to riches to rags tale that could have been so much better if Strauss had stayed closer to McCoy's actual life; which fans of boxing history know had more than a few twists and turns to it, or at least skipped the ridiculous character of Johnnie Gold, who is so over the top in his Machiavellian plans that he is seen as blatantly unbelievable. Strauss is most successful at portraying McCoy's love for Susan Fields, an actress, who McCoy is constantly winning back after pushing her from his life with his lies.  Strauss does a nice job recreating the rural and urban America of the early twentieth century, but Johnnie Gold and the finish with McCoy's plan for one last score are just so far-fetched they distract from the other pleasures of the novel. An interesting read, but like CHANG AND ENG, the idea for the novel is better than the execution.	2003-08-14

Many people seem to enjoy them and while it's not a style of mystery I'm normally drawn to, let's try it with an open mind.<BR>The good: The mystery itself is fairly clever. There are a number of red herrings and it will keep you intrigued to see how it falls together. The characters range from likeable to ridiculous stereotypes, but a new comer did not have much trouble figuring out who's who.<BR>The awful: I am sure the reason these books have found a home is the presence of the talking animals. I understand and accept that. However, this \\"hook\\" is one of the most annoying affectations that I have ever come across in literature. The animals are portrayed as incredibly intelligent yet can't convey their discoveries. The reason given is that the humans won't pay any attention to them. The real reason is this is being portrayed as a mystery novel not a fantasy. The animal commentary is so cloying and cutesy that I actually yelled at the book for the blatant silliness of it all. It is rare that a book can cause such aggravation.I also realize that there are thousands of fans of this series that love it enough to keep it going for so long. So I will wish Mrs. Murphy and the others well on all their other adventures. I won't be going along with them. I am sure I am now going to get hammered by all the \\"Sneaky Pie\\" fans.

Forever... that's how long it took me to get through this ridiculous hodgepodge of Irish blarney, skewed Manhattan history, and African mythology. Unlike SNOW IN AUGUST, with it its wonderful characterizations and short trip into fantasy, (albeit one of deus ex machina)FOREVER is overwhelmed by magic,  myth and bad romance. Cormac, our hero, is granted eternal life by an African shaman he saves while on a quest to kill the English lord responsible for his parents' deaths. Whew, more plausible fantasy is found on the old soap, DARK SHADOWS. I love good fantasy but this is its opposite. Missed opportunities are found throughout the novel, where an interesting history of NYC could have been portrayed through vignettes. Instead we get a full 1/3 of the book setting up how Cormac becomes immortal; then in quick order, the Revolutionary War, Cholera in 1834 and the subsequent urban renewal through arson, an oddly sympathetic portrayal of Boss Tweed, and finally 9/11. But there are so many other time periods and events that Hamill chooses to ignore in favor of character development for a character who really doesn't deserve the effort. There doesn't seem to be anything Hamill can do to make Cormac interesting. The only thing that really comes to life in this novel is NYC; Hamill should have made the city the star.	2003-07-02

King's life is presented here in a breezy, happy go lucky style. Ostensibly an autobiography, (although if you heard any of B.B.'s interviews about the book and his amazement at some of the details that were revealed, you know David Ritz did much more than help out.) this book deals with B.B.'s childhood of amazing poverty and his eventual rise to be the \\"King of the Blues.\\" Conversational in style, but revealing in detail, BLUES ALL AROUND ME works as both a personal reminiscence and as a look at the life of a black man living in America during the 20th century. Tales of racism (in the military and elsewhere), the difficulties of dealing with a less than honest music industry, and the struggle for success against these odds are all expressed in a manner that shows no true anger, rather an acceptance that these were challenges to overcome. B.B.'s personal relationships with the many women in his life is not avoided, nor his opinions of many of his contemporaries.

By gradually (a bit too gradually) introducing the reader to the time period and the public's preoccupation with all things mechanical, Standage shows the reader a world waiting to be amazed; even if the amazement comes by way of an ingenious form of misdirection. With appearances by a number of figures who were intimately involved with The Turk's \\"performances to the interaction of such luminaries as Napoleon and Poe, Standage keeps the reader interested in each and every twist of The Turk's rather bizarre history. It is only when Standage takes on the philosophy of the \\"thinking machine\\" does the book make a wrong turn; it slows down the pace and interrupts the flow of what is otherwise an intriguing look this amazing example of man's ingenuity. <BR>P.S.

JOHN HENRY DAYS gives us John Henry, the icon, the mascot, the hero, the folktale, all wrapped up in this novel that bounces between Talcott, West Virginia for the U.S. Postal service release of the John Henry stamp and a number of times and place that show John Henry's importance in the fabric of America's history. Our protagonist in Talcott is J, a writer working on a non-stop jag of event after event, getting work from the omniscient List and living on free food and lodging, collecting receipts and rarely contemplating an empty existence. J's progression from this rather shallow being to a man who at least begins to question life's meaning is the main focus of the story. Too bad, it doesn't work. By the time J becomes interesting you just don't care enough about him. Whitehead creates such an emotional distance between the character and the reader that you really want to get back to the other stories contained within this novel.<BR> The other stories are trips through America's past and John Henry's place in it, a bittersweet look at a young girl discovering the joy of discovering \\"The Ballad of John Henry\\" and how that doesn't fit in with view her mother has of a future member of the Sepia Ladies club of Harlem, a blues singer in Chicago cutting record sides and John Henry being his ticket to a few extra dollars, the destruction of Paul Robeson for not being what the American establishment wanted him to be; these are the stories that make this book worth reading. Best of all are Whitehead's takes on John Henry himself, the folktale comes to life as real human being. <BR> Whitehead writes wonderful sentences. They are crafted beautifully and each seems to be placed with as much care as any master craftsman creating a work of art. The problem is that he spends too much time working with a creation that doesn't seem to warrant his attention. Read it for the beauty of its construction and the trips into the past, but the central plot left me cold.	2003-05-26

Each synopsis seems to be a repeat of the previous one depending on the region. Sticking pretty much to the main highways and spending far too much time in the big cities (8 places in Pittsburgh alone) the repetitious style starts to wear thin. In NJ (My home state) you are pretty much limited to subs and hot dogs. This is repeated throughout the book, lobster roll and clams in New England, BBQ and fried food in the south, you get the picture. Occasionally peppered throughout are a few personal commentaries about the people and places, but I think this could have been a more useful guide by focusing on fewer places with more detail. The summary says you should carry it with you, but its size keeps it from being a good traveling companion, especially considering its narrow culinary focus. While not a total waste of time for the road food adventurer, it is so much less than it could have been.	2003-05-26

Bourdain pulls no punches here; (if you go to a brunch after this you're probably a daredevil)his world of cooking is one of violence, long hours, drugs and alcohol, and more than enough enough testosterone. It's the constant machismo that wears thin after a while, when Bourdain is on target (\\"A Day in the Life\\" will actually get your heart racing) this book is as good as it gets, but for every great section you have another like \\"The Level of Discourse\\" which reads like a discarded George Carlin bit.

In this first volume of Gary Giddins' biography of Crosby, a valiant effort is made by Giddins to capture what made Crosby such a popular and important figure. This volume details  Crosby's early years and his rise to fame; ending in 1940, shortly before the height of his popularity. Giddins' understanding of jazz serves him in good stead here; with in depth analysis of Crosby musical talent. As I am not a musician, I will bow to Mr. Giddins obvious understanding of how Crosby was able to synthesize many influences (not the least of which was the great Louis Armstrong) and create an entirely new take on many songs. With his ability to articulate, combined with his talent for understanding a song's natural rhythm; Crosby became one of the most important innovators of jazz, but Giddins shows the reader how that talent was eventually homogenized by the influence of  Jack Kapp, the man who is most responsible for Bing's gradual transition from jazz artist to the most popular recording artist of the 1st half of the 2oth century. Giddins also has a solid grasp of Crosby's gradual rise to success; as he worked his way from vaudeville performer to radio and film star. Where the book falls short is in its examination of the man himself. Crosby remains a cipher, an accusation that was often made of him by his contemporaries. The death of his close friend and accompanist, Eddie Lang is shown by Giddins to be a major cause of his distant relationship with people, but there seems to be more of a story here than Giddins was able to discover. Giddins also makes some unfortunate choices in his descriptions of others. Words like \\"effeminate\\" and \\"dwarfish\\" are used in descriptions where they really have no purpose in context. Dixie Crosby's gradual drift into the haze of alcoholism is mentioned, but without any major examination into the effects of this circumstance on Bing or their children.  But it's early yet. Giddins' examination of Crosby has just begun and I look forward to the second.	2003-04-08

Morocco, Cambodia, Vietnam, are all on his travel schedule as he pursues the perfect meal. Cobra heart, haggis, fugu are all on the agenda, but it's the little wonders that are truly memorable. The Tokyo fish market, the trip to the hometown of his sous chef, a wonderful look at true Mexican cooking,and Bourdain's regret and acceptance over a pig being slaughtered for his benefit in Portugal are all wonderful examples of how well Bourdain can tell a story. Bourdain constantly entertains and intrigues with his willingness to describe the food, the people, and most comically, the TV Food Network's attempts to \\"spice\\" (sorry) things up. Much more thoughtful than the \\"in your face\\" approach of KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL, A COOK'S TOUR succeeds as a culinary adventure, with an intelligent and thoughful guide, who realizes that \\"Perfect, like happy, sneaks up on you.\\"	2003-04-08

THE MUSEUM OF HOAXES is a book based on a website collecting a variety of tall tales, con games, fantastic stories and urban legends. The problem with the book is that the haphazard way the stories are put together and their general brevity works on a website, but are far from acceptable in a book. Very little investigation is done into the actual circumstances of each hoax and the prose lacks any variation or even a good sense of humor. The best thing about this book is that it might pique a reader's interest to investigate some of the stories behind these little glimpses into mankind's collective gullibility.

Justin Quayle's wife has been murdered, and this quiet British diplomat tries to unravel what occurred. What he finds is deceit, betrayal and eventually a realization that the things he thought were important really don't count for much. While on a journey through his wife's life, Justin learns how much he has failed as a husband and how difficult it is to set things right in a world that is not concerned about morality. Le Carre greatest talent is his ability to make us care for his characters as they struggle valiantly against odds too great to overcome. There is no mastermind here, just a faceless corporate entity whose singular quest for profit leaves many lives in jeopardy. Le Carre is not afraid to show the ugliness of this world, warts and all, and there is a great deal of truth in this work of fiction. This one will force you to think about a number of issues that may have escaped your notice; at least that's what happened to me after finishing this one.  Some people wondered what Le Carre would do after the Berlin Wall fell; THE CONSTANT GARDENER shows that he definitely is not at a loss for ideas or \\"bad guys.\\"	2003-02-06

(One ten millionth the distance between the North Pole and the Equator) Along the way, they combat rapidly changing governments, ignorance and fear of the unknown, and most importantly (in Mechain's case), a crippling fear of error. The twists and turns of this enterprise are amazingly well-researched by Adler, and they are written in a style that is both informative and entertaining.  Adler suggests that this quest led to nothing less than the transformation of how science was perceived by its practitioners; the change from the idea of savants (who believed in certain absolutes in science) to scientists (who were \\"engaged in a struggle to quantify their [scientists] uncertainty. \\") The metric systems importance to France and the world at large is explained in political and economic terms that are easily digested by the reader, but at the heart of this book is the basic concept that how man deals with error; it can be his salvation or in the case of Mechain, his downfall. This is a wonderful examination of  this momentous undertaking and well worth the time of anyone interested in man's constant efforts to utilize science for the improvement of the human condition.	2003-02-06

Forget about labels, SF, fantasy, etc. He is just one of the better practitioners of this art form. He also can be one of the most infuriating, writing experimental stories that take many pages to say nothing. ANGRY CANDY is bit of both with the good outweighing the incomprehensible.<BR>\\"Paladin of the Lost Hour,\\" \\"Prince Myshkin,\\" \\"Laugh Track,\\" and especially \\"Soft Monkey\\" ( an incredible tale of survival in the heartless city) are all fine examples of Ellison's ability to create a variety of stories that can grip you with suspense or put a mile on your face ( a  rare talent in any writer). It is the few occasions where Ellison drifts off into the bizarre; with stories like \\"The Region Between\\" or \\"Eidolons\\" where the point is...well I'm not sure where the point is; this being the problem. It is these types of stories that keep me from giving this collection the highest rating, but one thing about Ellison's writing it is never boring and it will always challenge the reader's emotions and intellect. ANGRY CANDY is another example of Ellison's ability to do both of these things magnificently.	2003-02-06

The flashbacks to their lives and that of their rebellious daughter gave me no sense of connection to the characters. They were a particularly dull couple, two academics, who met during a research project, fell in something that approximated love, and stayed together. While the husband tries to rekindle some youthful passion and the wife tries to deal with her own demons related to a horrific fire at this site, they are murdered by a passing drifter. The eventual return of their bodies to nature after life seeps out of them becomes the core of this book. Nature at its most raw and unfeeling is unleashed, yet Crace makes it seem comforting after the senseless destruction that ended the lives of his characters.  Flashbacks and the daughter's eventual return to search for her parents seem unnecessary and interrupt the flow of the book, to the point where they seem to be filler, needed to turn an excellent short story into a novel.	2003-01-29

The relationship Abe had with his parents and their place in the community sounds very realistic. At this point, I felt Slotkin had a real grasp of what Lincoln might have been like and I was really enjoying this speculative look at the young Abe Lincoln. The trip down the river changed that for me. Slotkin uses Lincoln's flatboat journey down the Mississippi as the basis of Lincoln's eventual political beliefs, but it just doesn't ring true. The journey is one event after another, with social and sexual overtones that intefere with the natural flow of the novel. Eventually, it doesn't even seem that the novel is about Abe Lincoln anymore, but some nameless boy's \\"journey into manhood along the Mississippi\\". The best historical fiction gives the reader insight into the characters; this book seems to be trying to make too strong a point, as if it were an actual historical document instead of a picaresque fiction.

The plot, such as it is, deals with a race of creatures that return from the past and start reverting people to a more primitive state. Why is not entirely clear and I just didn't care enough to figure it out. The characters are so interchangeable that you can't tell one from another and the big finish happens so quickly that there is no attempt to build suspense.

Many red herrings shouldn't keep the careful reader from seeing the ending coming, but the individual by-play between Estleman's \\"tough guy\\" and the various characters he deals with is worth the price of admission.

The bits of history are fascinating and compensate for the rather pedestrian plot. Combining fictional and historical figures works well as they seamlessly combine, but the basic problem is the mystery is no mystery. The plot moves along at a good clip; but it leads to a foregone conclusion.

Too bad the execution is not up to the pitch. Starting with Artemis, who is introduced to the reader already the head of a criminal empire, most of the major characters are poorly written. (Although I will admit the Dwarf, Mulch, is an inventive if more than slightly repulsive character) They are cardboard cut outs, lacking in personality. They don't capture the imagination as characters from the best children's literature do; they just go from point a to b in a predictable fashion. The magic and wonder that should be found in the mythical creatures Fowl confronts is lost amidst crude dialogue and predictable plot turns. I know this has proven to be popular, but I honestly don't see why. It's definitely aimed at a male audience, not withstanding Sgt.

On any given page there are as many as 15 different names with barely enough information about each artist to differentiate them from one another. The book is so short and so densely packed that it is difficult to absorb the information. The author uses the regionalization of the Blues as it traveled from the South to the North as his basis for examination; occasionally throwing in lyrics or musical notes to support a point, but their inclusion seems to be haphazard at best.

While often filled with the melodramatic elements that are common in these types of novels; THE CARDINAL makes an honest attempt to show what life was like for a Catholic priest in the 1st half of the 20th century. By examining aspects of a priest's spiritual and temporal life, Robinson creates a moving portrait of the difficult choices that are made by a man who chooses this life. Abortion, miracles, and the financial realities of poor and wealthy parishes are all dealt with in an evenhanded manner, but with a continued focus on the belief system of the Catholic faith. The book shows particular strength when it deals directly with the Catholic Church and its hierarchy; with an emphasis on how the church felt about its American brethren.  The novel does slow down considerably when dealing with the protagonist's (Stephen Fermoyle) stereotypical Irish family and  Fermoyle's crisis of faith when confronted with feelings for various women in his life. But the novel does provide an intriguing view of what a priest's life might be like in America between World War I and II.	2002-08-21

By writing as Poe, Schechter was able to create the illusion of Poe telling this &quot;true&quot; tale. The problem is Poe's prose is deadly dull. With a delicate sensibility, &quot;Poe's&quot; narration avoids any mentions of things to horrible to convey to the gentle readers, leading the reader to fill in all the blanks. This technique starts as quaint, but rapidly becomes irksome . <BR>    The mystery is far fetched, but it is clever in the way it references Poe's work. Crockett's appearence as the frontier hero image he created for himself was a bit larger than life as was Poe's fainting at every horror. The portrayal of Poe's relationship to his cousin and future bride was appropriately creepy, but this occasional glimpse at the &quot;real&quot; Poe was buried amidst the dated Poe first person dialogue. A good idea, buried under literary pretensions.	2002-08-01

King's fantastic and horrific visuals are well complimented by Straub's style and finesse. The book is an intriguing mystery, with a definite sense of menace. Old friends and foes from The Talisman make their presence known and even the Dark Tower makes an oblique appearance. (Mainstream King fans may have missed King's epic fantasy series based on Childe Roland. It won't interfere with your enjoyment of this one, but it is definitely worth checking out.) Great characters like the radio savant Henry Leyden make the reader's acquaintance, and the occasional mistake (The beer brewing, college educated, biker gang for example) are easily forgiven. The story still doesn't feel complete, however. Hopefully the writers have a final tale to tell of Jack Sawyer and the Territories. (Now I'm going to have to read Bleak House, a Dickens that I haven't gotten to yet, and see how it compares.)	2002-07-10

He took over the life of another and basically lived a life he didn't deserve. It doesn't work. The idea of giving the reader an uncensored and outrageous Grant is lost amidst the metaphysical concepts of the importance of self and other navel-gazing. But when Ev Ehrlich focuses on the military Grant, struggling against incompetence, the novel becomes a comic tour-de-force. Playing against the profane and loyal Sherman, a Lincoln who is barely understood by those around him, and a lascivious Mary Lincoln, Grant becomes more human and funnier as each situation becomes direr. These sections are joys to read and the dialogue rings so true that you feel Ehrlich had a transcript. But then the reader is brought crashing back to earth by one more visit from the \\"other\\" Grant who becomes an \\"everyman\\" character representing the changing America. I would have preferred more laughs and less philosophy.	2002-07-10

The research is exemplary, bursting through the misconceptions and tall tales, with a factual account of the events and people of this era. Beginning each section with a narrative, Anbinder piques the reader's interest with a tale of old New York, followed by a straightforward historical account of the topic of the chapter. The Bowery Bhoys, the Dead Rabbits and Tammany Hall's effect on the area are all discussed in detail.<BR>     Rather than try to use a pure chronological order, the author focuses on socio-economic issues for the topic of each chapter. By giving a detailed investigation into topics like the daily life, patronage, and entertainment, Anbinder creates a realistic and interesting look at life in the notorious Five Points.	2002-07-10

Good triumphs, but not without paying a tremendous price. The pain of betrayal and the power of friendship are each given a full examination. A whole world is created, with languages and customs that are far from those we understand, but that are based on their own inherent logic.

The idea of a book dealing with the study of an airplane malfunction, with occasional rants against the people who are supposed to protect our safety was a good one.  Crichton once again fills a book with a tremendous amount of information and barring a background in the field, the casual reader will be dazzled by the quantity of info presented. (The quality would need a more expert opinion than mine.)However cookie cutter characters abound and they are often interchangeable with the most cursory of description and motivation. Sometimes I think Chrichton decides to research things that he is interested in and than thinks, &quot;This might make a good book.&quot; Not this time.	2002-05-07

Combining the arrogance and naivete of youth with a fierce intelligence, Jason Moss creates what should be a harrowing tale of a boy who becomes entangled with a serial killer. Moss's plan to contact serial killers to \\"get inside their heads,\\" hits pay dirt when he starts to write to John Wayne Gacy. By posing as meek young boy willing to be dominated, Moss gets Gacy to show the true face of the serial killer. As the relationship between the two accelerates from letters to phone calls, Moss starts to lose his sense of self and begins to separate himself from his \\"normal life\\" and enters the dark world of serial killers. Gacy's repulsive personality is seen in all of its squalor as he gradually breaks down Moss's psyche culminating with a final meeting between the two, unsupervised, bringing Moss and the reader far closer to a serial killer than anyone should or would want to be.<br />  The major flaw in this book is the autobiographical format. Moss is an amateurish writer who tries to show humility, but constantly pats himself on the back. The information in this book is often stunning but the execution makes the reader long for a more skilled writer to tell it. For those who are fascinated by the evil that man do, The Last Victim does give an entry into the horrifying world of the serial killer, in a more personal fashion than most others of this genre.	2002-04-30

Creating a murder mystery set at a secretive international religious conclave, Kendrick sets  an interesting table. Populated with familiar characters (Mycroft, Lestrade, Watson) and using the clever excuse that this was Watson's undiluted (by Doyle) account; Kendrick creates a page turner. But the little errors kept nagging at me. Like when Holmes states he never caught the Ripper because \\"he was too random, impulsive and totally haphazard,\\" then in the next paragraph Holmes says, \\"The odder the murder, the easier it is to solve.\\" The Ripper murders were not odd? Later Kozan, the Buddhist monk, compliments Holmes twice on his familiarity with Buddhist principles. Did he forget the first conversation? I'm usually not that much of a nitpicker but these types of errors interfered with my enjoyment of this book.	2002-04-30

Each play is examined thoroughly, with the author taking the time to give examples of Shakespeare's abilities as a creator.  The reader is constantly fascinated and challenged by Bloom's observations into Shakespeare's plays, and will be amazed at the details and understanding that Bloom brings to light. Bloom's particular focus is on the characters that transcend the norms of literature, those that seem to take on their own lives, like Hamlet and Falstaff. Bloom presents the characters as examples of Shakespeare's magnificent powers and considering Bloom's exceptional ability to justify his point of view; it is difficult to disagree with him. Not since Ian McKellen's \\"Acting Shakespeare\\" have I seen Shakespeare's plays so clearly. Did Shakespeare \\"invent\\" us? Maybe not, Bloom makes it clear that the world would be a very different place without him.	2002-03-26

Charles Carter, a contemporary of Houdini's, is the Carter in question and Gold does a fine job of mixing fact with fantasy to create this mixture of history, romance and mystery. The novel is a delight when Gold shows us Carter as a man who tries constantly to achieve the next level in performance, to leave the audience stunned by the magic of the moment.  Carter's trials and tribulations are intriguing enough to support the novel. The problem lies with the all the extraneous action, Warren G. Harding's death, the disgraced secret service agent who is sure Carter has something to do with it, and Carter's \\"magical\\" nemesis Mysterioso. The mystery itself is not very challenging, and actually leads to a very long, drawn out climax that really would work better as the end of a movie.<BR>The true enjoyment of the novel comes from the characters that come back to life in Gold's capable hands. The imperious Houdini, some performing brothers named Leonard, Adolph and Julius (better known by their stage names), and even a young inventor named Philo Farnsworth make delightful appearances. Gold recreates the 20's with an ease that is appreciated by the reader. From BMW motorcycles and Pierce Arrows to PEZ, Gold makes it all work. It's easy to forget this is fiction when Gold focuses on Carter and his world of magic.	2002-03-26

Relegated to a history trivia question,  (Ex: Who was the first Vice-President of the U.S.?) John Adams is presented here as he should be, as a true patriot, an impressive intellect, and a virtuous man, without whom the chances that America would exist as it is today are nil. McCullough's Adams is far from perfect, with a vanity that blinded him, and a stubborn streak that prevented him from making the best decisions in regards to his own political future. Despite or in spite of these flaws, you can't help but admire all the things he accomplished for America.<BR>      McCullough also makes the reader aware of those who were Adams' confidantes and foes. Chief among the former was his wife Abigail, who is truly a remarkable woman whose influence on her husband cannot be discounted. Among the latter, Thomas Jefferson appears front and center, seen here, as a master manipulator, who starts and ends his life as Adams friend, but is his main foe during America's formative years. With a wonderful clarity and sense of purpose, McCullough's biography of John Adams should be required reading for anyone who wanted to gain a better understanding of America's early years as a nation and Adams importance to its development.	2002-03-26

The Burrowers Beneath introduces us to Titus Crow and his Watson de Marigny as they combat underground creatures from Lovecraft's Cthulu mythos. This is a taut thriller that gives the reader a much more active hero than any of Lovecraft's hapless victims. Lumley greatly improves upon Lovecraft, a man of great imagination with almost unreadable prose. Lumley does a fine job keeping the reader guessing to the bitter end how it would turn out for his protagonists.<BR>   Book 2: The Transition of Titus Crow is a drastic drop in quality. Crow travels in time, is transformed by a rather hackneyed old school science fiction method, and ends up in a place akin to paradise. It is all told in one long journey that has very little dramatic purpose and disappoints as horror, suspense, or science fiction. By making the journey too fantastic, Lumley loses sight of the very human characters so well used in the first book. For me, the collection was worth the purchase to discover this interesting character, <BR>but I can't wholeheartedly recommend this collection to anyone who doesn't already have an interest in Lovecraft's work.	2002-03-26

This is an example of the latter.

Some decent insights into his recording career are to be found throughout, but this is really not well-done.  You can put your time to better use by listening to a few Costello CD's and wonder about the workings of the man who created all this challenging music.

Louvish gathers many details about Fields' early life and career and uses this material to punch holes in the constantly repeated misinformation previous biographies contained (most of the misinformation was supplied by Fields himself. For the facts alone this book is worth the purchase for any fan of \\"The Great Man,\\" but don't expect to be enthralled by the writing style of Louvish, who has a tendency to write while patting himself on the back. Not enough time is spent on Fields' movie career and his personal life remains a mystery despite Louvish's efforts. Probably the best biography available on W.C.

Choosing to reprint the comics in their newsprint format, with the original coloring and pages turning brown with age, while stylistically interesting, proves to be a mistake as the quality detracts from truly appreciating Cole's skill and inventiveness.

An arthritic street performer, who once used his fingers as his puppets, he lives for his next sexual adventure. Any other ties to humanity, love, trust, honesty, (although he claims this value, he only uses it when it suits him) are lost amidst his pursuit of sexual gratification. Roth has deliberately created a character with no redeeming qualities, and while I admire his skill at developing such a reprehensible human being, I didn't enjoy reading about Mickey Sabbath or the lives he destroyed. No matter how many disastrous situations Roth creates for Sabbath I found myself wanting this to end; the book became a chore to read.

The title of this book is a bit misleading as the titular pond plays a minor role. This book is mainly concerned with the economic history of New England; the secondary concern is the effect this economic growth has had on New England's environment. As an overview of New England's growth from colonial struggles to industrial age giant, this book performs admirably and the material is well researched and documented. As a description of the environmental changes brought forth by this growth, the book is not quite as successful.The author occasionally intrudes with first person commentary, which seems strangely out of place and this often relates to the environmental impact of New England's economic transformations.

He lets you know that his version of Chang and Eng's life does not correspond to the known history of the &quot;Siamese Twins.&quot; But by giving voice to Eng's interior life without trying to stay within the framework of that life, I felt that Strauss was taking the easy way out. Working towards an understanding of the complexities of the life of a conjoined twin, Strauss succeeds admirably in giving Eng a voice that compels the reader to care for him and his brother. The problem lies in the soap opera elements of their relationship with their spouses and the idea that Strauss needed to change the facts to better fit his goals for the characters. A historical novel dealing with actual people need not pay lip service to history to tell the story. An interesting novel, worth your time, but I prefer historical novels to try to stay as close to the facts as possible.	2001-12-04

Grant's belief that Reconstruction and American Indian rights were of vital importance is undercut by his refusal to remove men who cannot, or worse will not implement his plans. Smith could have more closely examined Grant's relationship with his wife, Julia; her influence on Grant should not be ignored. Overall the qualities of this biography outweigh any faults and it is easily one of the better biographies of a man who rarely got his just due.	2001-10-10

Celibates and Other Lovers is a novel written like a series of intertwined short stories, never quite coming together as a true novel should. Taking place in the village of Creevagh, this slight book is an example of  \\"cute\\" Irish literature, with its silly characters, the expected Irish wake, and the overwhelming authority of the Roman Catholic church; all pushed together to form this superficial look at rural Ireland in the 40's and 50's. (Although you rarely get a good sense of time period other than the occasional pointed reference.) On the other hand, my mother, a first generation Irish-American, loved this book and found it to be very truthful, so I might not be the perfect audience for this one.	2001-10-08

Everywhere you look there is another fascination for the eye. The layout, the commentary, and the overall style are a sight to behold. But Jimmy is such a pathetic figure you just want it too end because you can't take anymore. Abandoned by his father and raised by an overwhelming mother, Jimmy is a shell of a human being, barely existing. When given the opportunity to meet with his father he does so, which leads only to more heartache and indecision. By journeying back in time you see that Jimmy is a product of generations of neglect, and while Ware succeeds in making you want to grab a hold of Jimmy and say you'll be his friend, he is also smart enough to show you how depressing this could be for you if you let that occur. I found it too unrelentingly depressing to recommend without hesitation, but if you are looking for an example of the literary quality this format can achieve; you could do a lot worse than Ware's work.	2001-09-19

Loeween's companion to Lies My Teacher Told Me is an examination of our nation's fascination with corrupting the past. Statues and memorials to Klansmen and others of their ilk abound and it is amazing in this day and age that this many errors of taste, judgment, and research exist and seen as our heritage. For this reason alone this book is worth reading. The only difficulty is it must be taken in small doses, as you will be overwhelmed by the similarities between the sites. After awhile you become numb to the constant repetition of sites that degrade, insult or ignore many Americans whose contributions are as important as any who happened to be males of European descent, and I am sure this is not the author's intent. For it's relative importance to an understanding of what is wrong with our historic sites this book deserves a high rating, but as a reading pleasure it dips drastically until it falls somewhere in the range of a very good text book.	2001-09-19

By creating a most readable version of Beowulf, Seamus Heaney has done the world a great service. His brilliant ability to capture the essence of this tale while allowing the language to flow in a beautiful rhythm is a wonder. The problem is the original story is what it is. Beowulf's battles with Grendel, his mother, and the final struggle with the dragon are still stunning and even more so in this version, with Heaney's interpretation carrying the day. But the remainder of the tale with its Nordic infighting and endless gift giving is tedious no matter how it is approached. At least now the boredom is enlivened by some great poetry.	2001-08-29

King's research and attention to detail is on full display here, perhaps too much detail. An assassination plot in Palestine is the central mystery here, but the story takes too long to unfold. While making for an interesting history lesson and a welcome view of the developing relationship between Holmes and Russell, the book could easily have been shorter by removing some of extraneous details that sometimes make the book more like a travelogue than a mystery.	2001-08-29

The character of Mike Hoolihan just never became a real cop to me. In one sentence she's talking tough,  \\"a bass player chokes to death on his own ralph,\\" the next paragraph  \\"a shoah of suicides\\" is mentioned. Is she a tough cop, or an intellectual one? If she's supposed to be both, it didn't convince me.  These inconsistencies are found throughout the book. At first the odd feel of the character intrigued me, but then I just started to be annoyed by her. The plot, dealing with a suicide investigation that Mike has a personal connection to,leads to an unsatisfactory conclusion. The last chapter is titled \\"The Seeing.\\" The sights within are very disappointing, and seem to make the whole book up to that point rather \\"pointless.\\" Maybe that was the author's intent, but I'm sorry I found out the hard way.	2001-08-07

Trying to describe Levi's journeys are particularly difficult because the visual element is as strong a component as the verbal; suffice to say that Levi's odysseys include trips to Hell, reality, school and time. The introduction mentions that these are the lighter strips in the series, which seems a bit of a cheat to me. Hopefully a more complete collection is in the offing. If this is \\"Leviathan Lite\\" I'm ready for the rest. This is a challenging and highly entertaining contribution to the world of comics.	2001-08-07

The Holmes presented in King's novel is more accessible than Doyle's , more human and maybe, more believable. By presenting the reader with an intellectual match for Holmes, in the form of Mary Russell, King has given Holmes an equal to play off of, not a Watson who stood in constant awe of Holmes' skills. The storyline itself presents the author with the typical problem of how to introduce the characters without boring the reader with exposition, and King does an admirable job in solving this difficulty. The mysteries and their solutions are well thought out and fit well into the established Holmes mythology. Any Holmes' fan should be will be well satisfied with this version of the \\"Great Detective.\\"	2001-07-30

He believes he is always correct despite plenty of evidence to the contrary, his personal grooming and general behavior is blatantly anti-social, and he treats his confused mother horribly.  He takes on a \\"Don Quixote\\" quality when attacking what he perceives as social injustice; usually making matters infinitely worse. Yet for all of this, you are compelled to finish this book about this very odd man, the particularly inept policeman whose actions start the book's action, a young man who is trapped in a modern form of slavery by events beyond his control, and a host of other New Orleans denizens who are all particularly bizarre but somehow very real. This work is a true original that probably could have used some editing ( some plotlines take far too long to develop); I don't know if I would categorize it as a classic, but it definitely shows an author who had talent and it is a shame that this is his only major work.	2001-07-30

The problem is the book reads like extended Ripley excerpts, sometimes containing some of the same sloppy research that was found in the newspaper strip. This book is filled with many interesting facts, but the scattershot method of compiling the info does not make it a compelling read. Luckily, an index is available to reference facts. The real problem with the book is the repetition of some of the historical errors that this book is designed to erase. Many times the author works with conjecture (\\"Did John Wilkes Booth escape?\\") or incorrect information (Jefferson's election was not the cause of Burr killing Hamilton in a duel; the duel took place years after the election.) And to say that shameless self-promoter Ben Franklin was humble (a genius, yes; humble, no) is buying into the material that this book is supposed to be exposing. But giving due to such interesting people as Israel Putnam, and showing Benedict Arnold for the complex character he was, makes this book at least worth a look.	2001-07-30

In American Gods, Neil Gaiman revisits some of the territory he touched upon in his \\"Sandman\\" series. If belief is the food of the gods, what happens to them when no one believes anymore? Gaiman takes a long, hard look at this idea in his book.  Shadow, a recent parolee, finds his life in total disarray after his wife's death; in this confused state he enters the employ of Wednesday, who hires him to act as a bodyguard.  This begins an epic journey into the concepts of belief, commercialism, death, and why America is so different from the rest of the world. I enjoyed the book, but I sometimes felt Gaiman had bitten off more than the reader can chew. By filling this book with so many diverse characters,and by assuming the reader understood their relative mythologies, Gaiman leaves the reader with the difficult task of understanding their motivations and actions. Maybe that is intentional, as man isn't supposed to know the way of gods, but I found it annoying. I have read many books of mythology and still felt left out by some of the references. It was a good read and Gaiman raises many valid points throughout, but it seems like the target audience was too small; the book seems like a missed opportunity to really take on America's cultural and religious ambiguity.	2001-07-30

This series takes a fresh look at superheroes, showing how a callow young man can grow into the role of hero. Robinson takes the idea of the new hero and shows the reader all his faults; the fears he faces, and his anger at events outside his control. Despite these factors, or in spite of them, Jack Knight becomes Starman. This is as good as superhero comics get.	2001-06-29

From the original story of Jessica Savitch, an ambitious and ultimately self-destructive young woman, Dunne's screenplay transforms over many years and many rewrites into a story that would get Disney's stamp of approval, which translates into \\"a feel good movie with an uplifting storyline\\".

Douglas Adams is such an author. The only problem is his writing style should be taken in small doses, because when read all together you start to get buried in all the clever little comments and they lose their effectiveness. The first two novels in this series are two of the funniest books I have ever read. The basic plot is simple: Earth is destroyed to make way for an interstellar highway and Arthur Dent, one particularly hapless Earthman, is taken along by an interstellar hitchhiker to the far reaches of space. This synopsis does not do justice to the incredible universe Adams drags us into: Ships that run on improbability factors or restaurants checks, a two headed former president of the galaxy who is looking for a real good time, and other events and people too bizarre and numerous to summarize. The problem is that each succeeding book seems to jettison some whimsy for a more serious form of science fiction until in the last book the laughs are hard to find. The first two books deserve the highest rating, but this review is based on all the content contained within. But once you start, you'll want to read all of them, Adams does make sure that the reader wants to know how it all turns out. Hopefully you'll enjoy the journey.	2001-06-29

There had been other comics that were designed for  mature readers, but Watchmen changed the face of comics forever. Alan Moore originally wanted to use the Charlton heroes (The Question, Blue Beetle Captain Atom) for this series, but when DC saw what was going to be done with the characters they told Moore to make up his own. This dark look at superheroes in a relatively realistic setting creates images and ideas that were new to the medium. It seemed that Moore had decided that comics should grow up, so he used shock therapy to make it happen. The story line of heroes being murdered, which eventually builds to an end of the world scenario, was not totally new but the execution of it was. With Dave Gibbon's clear, concise art and panel placement and Moore's imaginative plotting, the book worked its way to the only ending that was true to its theme, but that ending was gut wrenching nonetheless.	2001-06-29

In his introduction Frank McConnell refers to this series as a tragedy, and that is a true summation of this series. How long has Dream prepared for his own ending? The Fates, who have been seen throughout the series in various incarnations, are empowered to punish those who spill blood within their own family. Dream is now on their list. But hasn't Dream been setting this up throughout the series? Looking back you will see how masterfully Gaiman has planned this out. Unlike Destruction, Dream could not leave his kingdom unattended, forsaking his responsibility. Instead he sets the wheels of change in motion, and in essence he pulls the strings of fate (The fates?) himself. The outcome of this epic tale is never in doubt but it is bittersweet at best. All stories, even great ones must come to an end.	2001-06-26

Few do it well anymore, (although Anna Devere Smith and Spalding Gray come to mind) and Gaiman uses A World's End to take a breath and tell some stories before the end of the Sandman series. A tavern in the middle of nowhere is the place to tell stories of Prez Rickard, the elf Cluracan, of a young \\"man\\" at sea and a world dedicated to the proper treatment of the departed. As with any collection of short stories, some stories are more successful than others and one character even complains that they are all \\"boy's own stories\\" simply variations on a theme. This is basically true and I admire Gaiman for having made this reference himself. They are stories to kill time before the next journey.	2001-06-26

O'Higgins, who was Michael Collins successor in the effort to have an independent Ireland, is the catalyst for the latest of Nuala's \\"fey\\" episodes and her husband Dermot once again does the footwork.(Although this time his physical attributes are often brought into play) Mixed with an almost farcical attempt to kidnap Nuala, a charity concert in Ireland, and a commentary on the nature of lovemaking and its importance to a successful marriage, Greely bites off a bit more than he needs to. Sometimes the central mystery gets lost when there is too much extraneous material floating around, and this seems to be the problem here as it was with the last book in the series, Irish Whiskey.

Irish Whiskey, the third of Andrew Greeley's Nuala Anne McGrail mysteries is not as successful as its predecessors. The mystery deals with the mysterious death of an Irish bootlegger, Jimmy \\"Sweet Rolls\\" Sullivan and once again Nuala has the feeling something is not quite right with the story. But the mystery plays second fiddle to two sub-plots; the upcoming wedding of Nuala and her stalwart Watson, Dermot, and a case against Dermot concerning how he achieved the financial independence he has. The former is a problem due to the machinations of Nuala's oldest brother; the latter is caused by a vindictive figure from Dermot's past. Both these storylines take away from the original mystery, which plays second fiddle to these soap opera plot lines. While Greeley continues to make Nuala and Dermot enjoyable and believable characters this was a disappointing sequel.	2001-06-25

The tale of Rose Walker, the dream vortex who must be killed to save The Dreaming, is a complex one. The Doll House introduces the reader to many of the characters who would have a major effect on Gaiman's plans for the series. Particularly excellent is the tale of Hob Gadling, who becomes Dream's friend when he becomes the man \\"Death will not touch.\\" Their meetings each century are little history lessons so well executed they make you wish for more. The \\"Cereal\\" convention, with special guest lecturer the Corinthian, is a scary look at the fascination with serial killers and the final twist involving Desire gives the reader some insight into the relationship of Dream with his siblings.

While trying to capture the personification of Death (a tried and true fantasy convention) a magician captures instead the King of Dreams, who remains his prisoner for seven decades until he (Dream) is finally given an opportunity to escape. Comic book conventions come into play at the beginning with guest appearances by John Constantine and Etrigan as Dream pursues his lost tools of office. But when Dream finally confronts the man,(a minor DC villain,Dr. Destiny)who possesses the last of these tools the series enters a different realm far from the typical comic book. Taking his lead from Alan Moore's work on Swamp Thing, Gaiman creates an atmosphere of real horror as Dr. Destiny warps the lives of a few unlucky diner patrons, driving them to madness before he is finally stopped by Dream. It is in the scenes at the diner Gamain's talent really comes to the forefront and you realize that this is no typical comic book experience. By showing the gradual destruction of these characters Gaiman give the reader a peak at what becomes the theme of the entire series; the power of dreams in our lives.	2001-06-25

Not fighting for revenge or glory, he is a hero because it's the right thing to do. That may sound trite to some, but the truly wonderful thing about this character is Robinson's ability to create a superhero that has no agenda other than protecting his city and the people in it.

Dream plays a minor but pivotal role in these tales; tales designed to show that the importance of dreams is really the key to the series, not Dream as a character. Of particular beauty is Charles Vess's art on \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" where he is equally adept at showing Richard Burbage's players as he is at showing the denizens of Faerie.

From the Quidditch World Cup to the Tri-Wizard tournament, this book bounces from one major event to another with little of the character development that Rowling has become justly known for. More trouble for Hagrid, more problems with Snape, and red herrings abound in this massive tome. The most compelling aspect of this novel is the understanding that Voldemort's evil is a powerful one; it manifests itself horribly in the climax of this tale and reminds the reader that all is not laughs and good times for Hogwart's most famous student. Hopefully Rowling will get back on track with the next installment. Sometimes, less is more.	2001-04-25

Watson's presence is sorely missed and efforts to replace his role with characters from the opera are unsuccessful. Irene Adler's inclusion is an uneccessary distraction and is used soley to comment on Holmes' sexual repression. The case itself is so familiar to the reader that only the inclusion of Holmes changes the basic story, thus there are no surprises.(who doesn't know the basics of Laroux's Phantom?) This was a very disappointing sequel to Meyer's other Holmes' novels and wasn't owrth the wait.	2001-04-25

Hughes	In American Visions, Robert Hughes takes on the rather daunting task of summing up the history of American art.  While he does not entirely succeed it is a valiant effort. By using nine time periods, Hughes attempts to make the understanding of the art he believes is important easier to digest. The inherent problem lies with the concept of what Hughes deems important. Art is not easily criticized, one man's masterpiece is often someone else's waste of time, and although I admire Hughes' willingness to put himself on the line time after time, I often disagree with his emphasis. Artists like Winslow Homer and Edward Hopper get their due, but many others like Alexander Calder get a fleeting mention. Sculpture and photography are ignored and architecture is dealt with in huge sections and then forgotten until the next period Hughes feels is worth discussing. Hughes also has the annoying habit of referencing a painting and then not have it shown, an example being the Warhol \\"Electric Chair\\" pieces that are not presented although they are discussed in some detail. Hughes' vocabulary will have you reaching for a dictionary at some points and wincing at the use of crude descriptions at others ( \\"Charles Demuth was not a flaming queen\\"  \\"Mabel Dodge Luhan ...an intolerable b----) Overall this book frustrates as it educates and the combination is irritating to say the least. It just appears that Hughes has just bitten off more than the reader can chew. While it is a starting point for those of us whose art history is sorely lacking it just doesn't satisfy as a reference work; it is more of a critical review of art in America, not the same thing as a history.	2001-04-24

By using such rarely seen characters as Captain Triumph and Mr.America along with the &quot;big guns&quot; of the era (Green Lantern, The Atom,etc.)James Robinson visits a Post WWII America where superheroes are considered suspect, and only those who conform are to be trusted. Using superheroes to comment on McCarthyism may seem to be a stretch, but Robinson makes the story challenging with many twists. The &quot;alternate history&quot; concept gives the author the freedom to take chances, but also eliminates the element of &quot;this can't be happening&quot; suspense. Too many sub plots (Hourman's addiction, Starman's breakdown) get in the way of the more compelling central tale.<br />Paul Smith's art is a wonder throughout. Shifting from the well-lit scenes of Dyna-man to Paul Kirk's despair, Smith constantly creates visuals that hold your attention and never let you forget the true wonder of this medium; the ability for two dimensional, brightly colored figures to fascinate and entertain.	2001-03-28

The first book in this series (Against The Brotherhood)introduced the reader to a Mycroft Holmes who was a bit too much of an action hero to fit my personal take on the character. Although I enjoyed the 1st book , the plot of Embassy Row better fits the character of Sherlock's brother. Filled with intrigue over a treaty with Japan, The Emperor's son and a mystery woman, and a murder that may cause the events to explode; Embassy Row does an excellent job of showing the behind the scenes role of Mycroft Holmes, hinted at in the few Sherlock Holmes tales he made an appearence in. I did have some problems with Holmes' late identification of the mystery woman, which will be patently obvious to the reader, and the constant appearence of The Golden Lodge's Miss Gatspy, whose role  works as &quot;deus ex machina.&quot; I hope Mr. Fawcett can avoid falling into this trap too often.

Well, the &quot;bloodthirsty&quot; part was correct. The Spider takes all the conventions of the Shadow, blazing guns, long suffering girlfriend, cape, slouching hat, and does a poor imitation. Hundreds of people die at the hands of evil masterminds in both novellas and the Spider is in a constant state of rage throughout. Rage is the basic emotion and even that emotion is not effectively conveyed to the reader. Exclamation points are used throughout the novels for the purpose of creating excitement, it's the written equivalent of constantly screaming at the reader, it loses it's effect very quickly and in the end becomes annoying. The only reason for two stars instead of one is the general excitement of the first tale(The Devil's Paymaster)which at least tries to be creative.These stories lack the sheer mystery of the Shadow or the escapist fun of Doc Savage.

Ellis' Founding Brothers we see the men who are considered the &quot;Founding Fathers&quot; as they really were, men, not the infallible heroes of American history text books. By showing how these men reacted to events in their lives and their interactions with one another, Ellis shows the reader fallible men, with too much pride and envy, who despite these faults helped form America. Events such as Washington's Farewell and the choice of Washington D.C. for the capital are discussed in detail and give the reader insight into the politics and personalities of the times. Despite having to work through the very wordy preface and one more re-telling of the Burr-Hamilton duel that really adds nothing to the book, this book is a highly informative look at the early history of the U.S.A.	2001-02-22

Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill combine for an exciting ride with Allan Quartermain, Jekyll and Hyde, Mina Murray(Harker), the Invisible man, and Captain Nemo. With guest appearances by Sherlock Holmes, Auguste Dupin, the Artful Dodger and a few of literatures great villains this book is fun journey through &quot;what if?&quot; territory with incredible visuals by O'Neill of an England that never was but might have been. The storyline is a bit predictable but overall Moore makes these characters come alive again in a format that appeals to today's readers. I look forward to a return of this group and maybe a visit with the earlier team that seems to have contained such members as Natty Bumpo and Dr. Syn. The only thing missing as mentioned in another review is the Victorian ads that were in the original comics, some were priceless!	2001-02-19

Welcome to the Golden Age of Superheroes! Fueled by imagination the team of Kavalier and Clay create the Escapist, a combination of Houdini and Superman, who battles Nazis before anyone else and becomes one of the most popular superheroes ever. Michael Chabon has recreated the world of the thirties and forties, a world populated by surrealists, escape artists, radio stars and comic books. With Kavalier, a young man who escapes the Nazi occupation of Prague, and Clay, a New Yorker who escapes from an unhappy childhood, Chabon creates an endearing team. While the book loses focus when Kavalier goes to war, the total effect is one of nostalgia looked at through the eyes of a modern writer with a love for wonderful world of comics. Besides any guy who thanks Jack &quot;King&quot; Kirby in his acknowledgements deserves my thanks for remembering one of comics' greatest artists.	2001-02-15

This is my first book in this popular mystery series and I just don't get it. All the characters represent some type of Southern stereotype, the detective work is haphazard at best, and the ending is reminiscent of something out of the Dukes of Hazzard, where everything just happens to fall into place.

Sir John Fielding was founder of the Bow Street Runners, the precursors to modern policemen and Bruce Alexander makes a valiant effort to turn him into the hero of this mystery. The details to the criminal investigation with the limitations of the forensics ring true and the characters are engaging. The mysteries themselves are very basic and some characters seem to be added just for effect, but all in all not a bad addition to the historical mystery field.	2001-02-15

This collection of Groucho's correspondence illustrates a number of things about the man. His wit was not limited to performance, his relationships with his friends were long lasting, and he wrote a number of warm and humorous missives to his children. You get the feeling that this collection is just the tip of the iceberg and a more complete portrait of the man could be seen with a more complete collection of his letters. Until the day an unedited and complete collection is released, fans can make do with this look at some of the funniest letter writing ever to be printed for public consumption.	2001-02-08

If you are looking for a well-researched bio into the life of Groucho Marx, look elsewhere. Arthur Marx's accounts of the Marx brothers' history is basically a rehash of the old stories Groucho had told him, many untrue and without additional research Arthur just tells them again. It is with his eyewitness accounts of Groucho's life that Arthur creates an interesting addition to the Marx booklist. From the ride back from Chico's funeral with Groucho and Harpo to his scathing attack on Erin Flemings influence on his father this book makes for an interesting read. Arthur Marx is a solid story teller and the book is an easy enjoyable read. Just don't confuse it for the truth.	2001-02-07

I was pleasantly surprised. Rowling seems to have the knack for making believable characters young readers will care about. Although Harry probably should be a bit more dysfunctional considering his upbringing, (Don't they have child welfare in his world?) he is a welcome hero, one filled with flaws but also possessing the courage that makes a hero. Any book that promotes reading in today's world has value but it's nice to see Rowling is a true story teller. Not with the epic reach of Lewis' Narnia tales or Tolkien's Ring saga but maybe a better style for today's children, focussing on the power of friendship and the importance of the little things. She has made me curious to see how this all turns out in the end.	2001-01-28

His obvious joy about digging up Margaret Dumont's biographical history takes away from the real accomplishment of the research needed to discover the info in the first place. The books abounds with examples of this cloying style. An example of the annoying writing follows: P.365 &quot;All the fans of the Marx Brothers movies-even if each watched their idols' films 600 times over on the screen-would not equal the number of viewers who would watch You Bet Your Life on one night at its peak, in 1957. I confess I made up that last statistic, but the point stands.&quot;<br />If you made up the stat how does it make a point! This is just one example of Louvish's annoying habit of adding cute commentary to a book that needs none. The facts about the Marx's (and to give Louvish credit Zeppo and Gummo do not get the short end of the stick for once) don't need embellishment, they are interesting enough without the &quot;clever&quot; quips. True Marx fans may find the wading through the syrup worthwhile.	2001-01-22

Almost all American school children are at one point or another presented with the story of Lewis and Clark and their epic trip across the West. This book finally gives us the true details of the journey. From the tedium of planning to Sacajawea's proper place in the expedition's success, Ambrose takes material culled from Lewis and Clark's journals and his own experience on the trail and crafts a fascinating story of these two men and their adventure across the wilderness. Even Lewis's deterioration and eventual suicide is dealt with clearly and with as much accuracy and compassion as history allows. A phenomenal undertaking and one that will be hard to improve upon.	2001-01-15

What I found was a fairly straight forward oral history of the D-Day invasion and eventual victory in Europe. It is made clear that this book is a synthesis of many of the author's previous works and I found myself thinking what purpose did this book actually serve if the ground has already been covered in prior books. I came to the conclusion that this was a WWII primer and if you found interest here you might want to go back and check out Ambrose's more detailed accounts of this time period. Aside from the Eisenhower apologies, this was an easy read but lacked depth. Ambrose makes his admiration and respect for these men clear and that makes perfect sense. But this particular book just seems unnecessary.	2001-01-15

The police work is thorough and though the crime itself is a bit far-fetched(dealing with the rights to a soon to be revived play)McBain plays fair and works towards his typical solid solution. Subplots dealing with some of the problems facing the NYPD are typical McBain, usually setting something up for the next book. Not his best work in the series but all the elements that regular readers of the 87th are looking for are here.	2001-01-02

In Gideon Lowry, John Leslie has created an intriguing detective. Korean War vet, lifetime native of the Keys, and a man who has faced quite a bit of personal tragedy, Lowry is a true original in a field where he detective is the true key(sorry!) to success. This tale of a lost and found chalice and a tragic suicide leads to an excellent mystery where the detective work makes sense and the characters ring true. This is the third book in the series but I will definitely check out this detective again.	2001-01-02

Daziel, the Nero Wolfe type, Pascoe, the gentleman, and Sgt. Wield, the biker cop, are involved in the odd disappearence of the local constable of Enscombe. Art, the loyal gentry, and a disturbed youth are all part of the mix. The characters are solid and the mystery plays fair with one exceptional red herring early on that changes the whole structure of the book until the end when you realize the author just threw it in for effect. Despite this, I'm willing to give this series another shot because the characters are so engaging...and that's really the reason most of us read these mysteries, isn't it?	2000-12-30

Like John Gardner's Grendel, Maguire takes a reviled villain and gives the reader a new perspective of the character. By showing an Oz of political intrigue, usurped by an outsider, Maguire takes the reader deep into a dark fantasy dominated by Elphaba, the green skinned offspring of...well see if you can guess. With an excellent attention to detail, Maguire creates an Oz much more interesting than Baum's and also much more adult. My only problem is the unexplained elements, like the dragon clock, that move the story but are left mysteries. In a book that explains so much about a fantastic character and her motivation for becoming what people perceive her to be, it seems inconsistent to leave so many other questions.	2000-12-28

With just a few basics to work with, Fawcett creates a plausible world for Mycroft to inhabit. The adventure, dealing with political intrigue and occult trappings, moves along well and many details of Mycroft's activities are explained. The inclusion of two different perspectives on the adventure (one from Mycroft's adventuring secretary, one from his butler) add to the interesting format Fawcett uses to move the plot along. Good fun in Victorian espionage.	2000-12-26

While there are elements of Kafka in this book (The Trial); Malamud focuses on the historical reality of a Jew being blamed for a &quot;ritualistic&quot; murder despite all evidence to the contrary. Occasionally, the description of the tedium of Yakov's stay in jail, mixed with the horror of it, can wear on the reader; but it is by demonstrating this that Malamud succeeds in creating the atmosphere of the times. The combination of history lesson and one man's struggle to hold onto what is really important makes this book an important one.	2000-12-12

Imus's scathing commentary on evangelists is not for the faint of heart. Sexual mores and religous beliefs are all fair game in this outrageous look at &quot;God's Other Son&quot; Billy Sol Hargus and his trials and tribulations.

Let me start out by saying I am an Imus fan and have been listening to his program since the 70's. That being said this book was a mild disappointment. The beautiful pictures of the American Southwest are definitely worth the price of admission. But the comments often get in the way. How many times does the phrase &quot;fat tourists&quot; need to be said in order to make a point?(At least three in this book along with other derogatory mentions.)The text seems to be an afterthought and probably could have been omitted all together. But the picture on page 12 alone makes the rest of it worthwhile.	2000-12-12

As a previous reviewer mentioned, the ending is a problem. While the characters are symbolic more than fully developed, they are a serviceable means of telling the story of one possible way the Gaels settled in Ireland. The history seems plausible and the daily life of this tribe comes across as very true. But after creating an atmosphere that seems to be based strongly on available research, Llywelyn introduces the &quot;little people&quot; and things rapidly go downhill. With cryptic mentions of powerful weapons that were &quot;earthkillers&quot; and the disappearence of the Tuatha De Danann, the book enters the realm of fantasy. Not a problem if it started that way, but quite a shock to this reader after following a journey that seemed very true up until this point. If you can make the leap the author requires of the reader, this book is an interesting look at the history of the Irish.	2000-12-07

If after 20 pages you can't figure out where this book is going you're probably going to enjoy it. The time period of the fifties serves no real purpose and adds nothing to the story. (Sea bass and salad in a restaurant in the 50's, please!)The spirituality of love is no trifle but this book never convinces me that this callow youth has made such an incredible change. The prose reads like something that could be picked up the young adult section in the library. There was one saving grace however; it was short.	2000-11-28

With exceptional detail, Baker shows the garish exterior and the seamy underbelly of Coney Island. He takes the reader on a journey through the cruel bars of the Bowery, the backroom politics of Tammany Hall and the brutal sweat shops of pre-sufferage America. By having Freud and &quot;Big Tim&quot; Sullivan interact with Baker's fictional creations, Baker creates a true portrait of the times. My only complaint is with the &quot;choose your own ending&quot; for Kid Twist and Esse. Rather than create various possibilities (although the author makes a point that one is more likely) why doesn't he just choose one? Ambiguous ending aside, this book is well worth your time.	2000-11-27

This mystery deals with the death of a writer, disliked by many, who takes on the tales of an eccentric small town detective. Filled with possible suspects, this book also serves to let Goldsborough take some shots at many targets.

Durkin was there due to Wolfe's refusal to handle a case involving threats to the leader of the Spire's congregation. Now due to Archie's guilt and Wolfe's sense of loyalty to one of his occasional operatives, he takes on the Spire's Circle of Faith to identify the murderer. This one is docked a star for having Wolfe leave the office for the weakest of reasons and confronting the suspects in the church offices. I would have preferred giving Durkin a little more to do considering it was his life on the line.	2000-10-05

Without a central theme other than &quot;How strange America is now&quot; Bryson's generally on target wit and observations tend to meander from point to point.

If an innocent man hadn't confessed there would be no reason to solve the case. This is the most flawed of the Goldsborough Wolfe series I have read. Archie approaches a situation with no real plan and becomes a temporary red herring. Along with murder, which is the usual fare in these mysteries, another crime which sets the chain of events in motion seems out of place in a Wolfe mystery. Finally there is a murderer whose motive better fits a cop show on television. This book just does not match up well to the Nero Wolfe legacy and it really stands out as something that only gets published because Nero Wolfe is on the cover.	2000-10-05

This time our narrator is an Englishwoman who inherits a house in  Sicily and turns it into a guest house in order to make ends meet. With  guests like Bertrand Russell, Henry Faulkner, and Roald Dahl this could  have been interesting. Instead it's more stories of &quot;how quaint these  people are,&quot; even the local mafia chief! Lacking depth and detail,  this book substitutes cute stories of the people and their way of life.  Even the stories that were humorous are retold rather archly and with a  disaffected attitude.	2000-09-12

For those looking for any insight into Murray look elsewhere. Padded  with extra commentary by golf pros, PGA officials and friends this book  will often bring a smile to your face but it is ultimately forgettable.	2000-08-14

She didn't as Archie contends and  Wolfe proves; she was murdered. The whole gang investigates in this one and  it will keep you guessing as there are a variety of reasons for young Faith  Usher's demise. The ending is a little weak as it relies on police  investigation to tie the murderer up but a good addition to the series.	2000-08-14

A body that should be discovered and a variety of possibilities make this book a solid Poirot mystery. The competition between Poirot and a young  detective who uses &quot;scientific methods&quot; such as investigating  tobacco ash appears to be a shot at another famous detective. More could  have been done with this but Christie usually wastes little time with  character development. Hastings is even dimmer than usual in this one, but  the mystery is a good one and not too obvious.	2000-08-14

The start is truly interesting but by the time we get involved with a combination of  Lovecraft and unexplained special powers you no longer care. I made it to  the end because I found the beginning so gripping but I did not feel it was  worth the effort. Straub has written much better books and they are well  worth reading, but this and The Hellfire Club are misses.	2000-07-26

While many books are reviewed in capsule form the author limits himself to repetitive comments like &quot;time waster&quot; or &quot;time passer.&quot; With A, B and C movies mixed together in what the author  refers to a festivals, the book lacks a consistent critical focus. Limited  to movies from 1980-1989 this series is not really that useful. For a  better take on the genre check out Michael Weldon or Danny Peary.	2000-07-26

Looking forward to fun book along the lines of THE BOOK OF LISTS, I instead found myself assaulted by an opinionated trashing of a number of performers, a fawning over P-Funk that takes up three pages, (yes, a great  band but George Clinton's names for himself as a list, PLEASE!)This book is  far too involved with personal attacks to be interesting.  I finished based  on the idea that I wanted to see who was going to fall victim to the  &quot;critical axe&quot; and at the end found this less than rewarding.  Even factual errors like song titles (Zevon's &quot;Carmelita&quot; as  Carmelita's Way&quot; or Thin Lizzy's &quot;Jailbreak&quot; as  &quot;There's gonna be a Jailbreak&quot; were distracting. There is also  whole chapters dedicated to rap which is interesting concept in this book  of Rock lists. I read this type of book for snippets of info and a few  laughs but I just found myself annoyed at the end.	2000-07-22

I finished this book admiring him as teacher not willing to be overcome by circumstances, and disliking him as someone who used his  past as an excuse to behave in a manner that was totally self-centered when  it came to his personal relationships. A complex man is presented, not just  a &quot;Horatio Alger&quot; character, but a real human being is seen here  for all to consider.	2000-07-10

The preface starts with &quot;This is not-nor was it ever intended to be- a definitive biography of the Lighthouse Stevensons.&quot; So the author decided to concentrate on the years 1786-1890 and in the process  shortchanged all the Stevensons. The author stated that to be comprehensive  the writing would be &quot;futile&quot; and &quot;wearing.&quot; The author  makes the reader question, &quot;Why bother?&quot; A scattered summary of  their various careers follows with a confusing look at the building of some  of Scotland's most important lighthouses. As someone with an interest in  lighthouses I was looking for &quot;comprehensive,&quot; not excuses.I also  don't think I've ever seen this many typos in a book published by a major  company.	2000-07-10

This book begins with alternating chapters dealing with the creative and business side of Rock in alternating chapters. While interesting, this dry relating of information is preferable to the idea that very little music of  note was created after the Sex Pistols, an idea that seems to grow as the  book progresses. Elvis and The Beatles get their due but others whose  impact was limited to style are favored over true originals. While Little  Richard and Jim Morrisson definitely made an impact, were they true musical  pioneers or was this a case of style over substance? The author is making a  case for this concept and the idea of &quot;selling out&quot; is bandied  about. Were classical composers selling out when they wrote for a fee or  circumstance? I wasn't convinced.	2000-07-10

Historical fiction that makes up in detail what it lacks in heart, multiple families whose lives mysteriously  repeat themselves(reincarnation?), and a heft to make you think it is more  than a giant soap opera. However, Michener is not for me and this book left  me cold. The history is pretty solid though, so at least it's  well-researched.	2000-05-29

While Heck creates a decent Twain for his book, the rest  is a sorry excuse for a mystery. An obvious villain and an insipid narrator make for a painful read. If not for a decent grasp of Twain's general demeanor and  commentary this book would have been unreadable. A good idea but the  execution does not make me want to see if the author grows into a better  mystery writer.	2000-05-29

By combining a compelling look at Frost's life with an informed commentary on his poetry, Parini has avoided the common pitfall of many biographers;  forgetting the work while describing the life. I feel I now have a much  greater understanding of the man and his work after reading this book which  should be the goal of all biographies and so rarely is.	2000-05-13

The problem is there are too many good characters and as you want to get to know more about one, Irving switches gears and you now are in the middle of  someone else's life. This proves to be very disconcerting and takes your  attention away from the plot. Much more focussed than Son of the Circus, A  Widow for One Year is enjoyable but lacks the emotional depth of Garp or  Owen Meany.	2000-03-13

(OK Romance novelists make a career out of it)Too bad Desperation was the good book and The Regulators  is an example of idea that should have stayeds in the notebook. I wish  Steve would get tired of the evil unknowable force that does bad things  because it feels like it. It reads more like Clive Barker than vintage  King.	1999-08-10

Steven King writes an epic western, a tale of love and sacrifice. Too bad he used this series to tell the story. This could have been a tale set in the old west, another genre King could have been put his stamp on but  instead the reader is sent through a journey into Roland's past. King's a  craftsman and the story moves along but it didn't move the journey towards  the tower any closer. It was a story King felt he needed to tell but maybe  it didn't need to be part of Roland's journey.	1999-05-04

Sometimes a book is written about people you just don't learn to care about. &quot;Surrender the Pink&quot; is a prime example of this. I never developed an affection for these characters, I just never learned to care  about their personal problems. They just came across as shallow, whiny  people.Some of the scenes, including being trapped in a closet in your  ex-husband's house, were very weak and lacked originality. All in all, just  not that much fun.	1999-03-02

In this book he takes the reader to Linda Manor, a Massachusetts nursing home, and shows the day to day life of  the residents. The stereotypes associated with the elderly are quietly  shattered by the men and women introduced in Kidder's book. Lives are  relived, pain is dealt with and each day is a challenge to be met. Kidder  does not hide his admiration for some of these people and his affection is  contagious. You learn to care for these people and that is what makes this  book so successful.	1999-01-23

The concept of trying to summarize Europe's history in a single volume is quite a feat. The problem is the author spends far too much time explaining what Europe is  (geographically) and too little making a clear explanation of how it all  came together. It makes for a good primer but the scope of the book is just  too great for one volume.	1999-01-21

Prison seems to bring out the best in King(?)and this book is no exception. Well-drawn characters, an excellent plot and some good King surprises make for a fun read.

By showing the ants' alien thought process in a context that the average reader can understand, Werber has created an incredibly vivid portrait of  the world under our feet. The problem lies with the human characters that  interact with the ants, leading to an anticlimax that takes away from the  &quot;Empire's&quot; own struggles. Allowing humans to be supporting  characters in this genre(Watership Down) may be helpful but they should not  actively participate. It takes away from the world that was created and  lessens it.	1998-11-30

Too many characters to keep track of, giving  his lead characters too little to do, and burying the reader with one deus  ex machina after another were just some of the frustrations with this  follow up to a much more suspenseful and clever book,The Alienist.

This is not an overview of the formation and acceptance of the Constitution, rather it is an in depth analysis of the goals and purposes behind its creation and those of its creators. A great effort was put into the writing of this book and my rating is based on my ability to absorb the information. It reads like a text book trying to appeal to a wider audience. In my case it did not achieve this goal. For a historian with the background to follow all the references I imagine it would be indispensible.	1998-07-09
