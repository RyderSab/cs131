Although I am not a big fan of introductions-before-book, this one by Donald Keene helps a lot (the spoilers are few) and is recommended.  Professor Keene's translation style is very limpid and flowing -- one is surprised by the end of Act Eleven when the climactic action sequence is brought to an end.<br /><br />Fans of Bunraku (puppet theatre) and Kabuki should have this book -- and hopefully the National Theatre in Tokyo might offer either version of the play (one can get in and see Bunraku these days for about 40-50 bucks).<br /><br />A note of warning:  as Prof. Keene points out, this work of literature shows the other side of Japanese art  (in contrast to austere restraint, this shows the Japanese love for color and violence) -- but it is not a non-stop action work.  Instead, it deals more with the \\"tests\\" of loyalty (hence the title) each retainer must show in order to be allowed to participate in the final plan to kill their lord's enemy.  In that way, Chushingura is much more about the love the retainers have for their lord than, in my opinion, the hatred and violence they harbor against the enemy.  Uma Thurman in samurai garb, they are not...uh...<br /><br />Fans of Chikamatsu's plays will find this popular work refreshing -- it moves at a much faster pace, with more feints here and there.  As a result, it lacks the gravitas of Chikamatsu's works, but it is much more fun.  A great book to own and then pass around to friends.	2005-08-31
US	52996633	R1ZWIQBJTR19AB	0873328205	29357096	Night of the Milky Way Railway	Books	3	10	12	N	Y	Probably the best Kenji Miyazawa book for parents to read to their child	Professor Strong's translation of Kenji's (as he is affectionately known to his fans) \\"Ginga tetsudo no yoru\\" is perhaps the best, most accessible English versions available.  And there are many available.  (Avoid the \\"Rock Press\\" _Milky Way Railway_ edition, it is rock-bottom.)  Roger Pulvers' recent translation and John Bester's older translation are also good (Pulvers' may only be accessible in Japan in Jpn/Eng bilingual format), but I think Strong's version may be the best one yet:  with easy to understand English, wonderful illustrations (that hint at the story contents, not explicate) -- plus you get her copious notes, biography and an alternate version -- all make this a nice copy to have in children's library.  I think it is well-suited for an adult to read to a child (the notes in the back can help the parent out of a jam if asked \\"what is a crow-lantern?\\").    That being said, I give the story (not so much the translation) 3/5 stars.  It is not my favorite Kenji story.  (I'm not convinced it really came from his hand.)  There are much better Kenji stories out there that I encourage anyone to read.  (Try Bester's collection \\"Once and Forever\\".)  \\"Night of the Milky Way Railway\\" is Kenji's longest work, but in my opinion it is not his magnum opus.  A better place to look for that are collections of his shorter stories (Restaruant of Many Orders, etc.) which patch together his brilliance.    Last bit of advice -- do not read the introduction.  (It contains spoilers.)	2005-08-19
US	52996633	R3UAMB748QIXCK	0679733787	66884954	The Woman in the Dunes	Books	2	13	27	N	N	Slow quicksand when 2 hour nausea would be preferred	Having studied Japanese literature for nearly ten years now, I have probably read this book three times and once in Japanese (bitz-n-places).  I am not a fan of the book however.  It is Abe's best known work although I think that's a shame.  With Teshigahara's film adaptations of Abe's works (to wit:  this book, \\"Face of Another\\" and \\"Ruined Map\\"), I have heard many say that the film version of \\"Woman in the Dunes\\" is much more interesting than the book.  In many ways, it is.  The book though does have some interesting features.    One thing, I think, one gets out of the book is that thought process of the man:  his mind is a real mess of mediaspeak, psychobabble, intellectual-posing, spoonfed-existentialism.  He is an anti-hero (perhaps the so-called \\"failed hero\\" of Meiji Japanese fiction) and it is hard to root for him.  Although it is easy to associate Abe's work with existentialism, I think the author is more interested in criticizing any kind of dogma -- even if existentialism was hip when he wrote the book in 1962.  At times, the novel gets bogged down with its deconstruction of thought-processes as seen in the unbelievably long part two.  At times, one is better off seeing the film, getting a 2-hour or less shot of its existentialist take, and moving on.    Parts one and three are really the more interesting sections of the novel.  How he gets lured in and how he figures he can escape -- to me, these show more imagination and creativity of the author than its brooding middle section.  Having read \\"Ark Sakura\\", \\"Face of Another\\" and Abe's short stories, I would say see the movies for his longer works (Teshigahara and Abe together are great) but try to get a hold of his short stories:  Abe is much better in shorter doses.	2005-08-19

Having just completed reading Tyler's new translation of The Tale of Genji, I figured it would be a good time to return to it.  You don't have to know much about Genji to enjoy Enchi's book -- but it helps.  The world she describes is one that is her own:  I have sensed characters something like this in other Japanese novelists, but Enchi's characters are really unique:  they exist on cultural 'roids, making a deeper impression on one than they should.  I'm not convinced that such characters exist in reality, but I do believe that Enchi believes they do.    Enchi uses Genji, Tales of Ise, Noh theater, and a bit of Kojiki as if it were still very much a part of the milleu these 20th century (circa 1958?) characters inhabit.  However, instead of a \\"mythic\\" structure where the modern characters re-enact the personalities of the past, they are rooted in Enchi's world.  The tragedy for many of the characters in the book is not so much that they are doomed to repeat the past, but that they will be doomed to repeat their mistakes in the future.  As another reviewer suggested, the book ends with a lot of questions.  It is a highly poetic novel without a clear sense of resolution, but it reads remarkably fast and is quite enjoyable.  Bound to generate hours of discussion as one tries to look beneath its surface.	2005-08-03

I would loan this out to friends who hadn't read the whole series -- friends who NOT might read all 28 volumes, but still want a good manga read. <br /> <br />The historical details really add to the impact of the individual stories as well as the full arc of this epic.  O-Shichiri (the runner) is awesome tale.	2005-02-16

Here we get Ogami in an intense showdown with the Yagyu forces -- with strong ramifications.

Volume 7 has two particularly good stories.  This is not to say that the other three are mediocre.  Far from it.<br />&quot;Dragnet&quot; - awesome story of how the Yagyu clan manipulates the shogunate into rounding up all criminals just to catch the one ronin they want.  The world of Edo politics is really the heart of this story.<br />&quot;Cloud Dragon, Wind Tiger&quot; is another great story depicting the world of the samurai, more than that of our hero.  In this case, the loyalty of a samurai is examined -- seen from many points of view -- Ogami Itto's inevitable winning duel becomes less important about the survival of our hero than for the metaphor of the death of the virtuous retainer and the code he embodies.  The moral at the end of the story explaining &quot;Cloud Dragon, Wind Tiger&quot; is perfectly rendered.<br />Vol. 7 seemed to represent a shift in the storytelling.  We still care about Itto and Daigoro -- but what really appeals to the reader is their world:  a thriving decadence and a disintegrating ethos.  When Itto has to use his trick gun, you know it's the samurai who have really lost.  4/5 stars here just to reserve my right to rave about the perfect 5 stories out of 5 later.	2004-07-10

This volume features two great stories -- one involving political intrigue from Northern Japan, and the second features a story about yakuza.  Writer Koike provides us with rich detail about the social customs -- the yakuza story is by far one of the most interesting Lone Wolf/Cub stories I've read in a while.  The stories are developing -- instead of merely rely upon the hero and his son, Koike fleshes out two minor characters yet still maintains the spirit of the overall epic he is building.  &quot;Lanterns for the Dead&quot; and &quot;The Soldier is the Castle&quot; are superb -- get this volume for sure.	2004-07-07

Usually, one associates the sword with Japanese martial arts.  Here, Perrin explains that the Japanese not only adopted the arbusque but improved on it to a point where it became too efficient a means to kill the enemy.  Ironically, the Tokugawa shoguns had to eliminate it to preserve the Pax Tokugawa that would run for 250+ years.<br />The book is easy to read:  he approaches the material from a variety of angles (source material from Japan, modern comparisons of contemporary European nations as well as contemporary comparisons by visitors back in the 17th and 18th centuries).  It is also well documented -- the list of notes alone provides one with a shopping list of future reading.  Overall though, I felt the book failed to expand and build its argument -- it just kept repeating itself chapter after chapter.<br />Another complaint I have is that, looking at the Japanese sources, Perrin tended to rely upon WWII Admiral Seiho Arima's  _Kaho no kigen sono denryu_.  Arima's research into pre-Meiji gunsmithing does seem like a good source of material, but one wonders if there were other sources of scholarship to include.  Otherwise, Perrin relies a lot on Western scholarship.<br />A final complaint about the book is the reproduction of the artwork.  The black and white reproductions at times are fuzzy.  A close-up instead of the full work at times might have been more helpful for the reader.<br />Although the book is written in a light scholarly tone which anyone can read, if it were not for its tight focus on its subject matter I would not recommend the book.  Its value lies in its exploration of a subject which goes overlooked in studies of Japanese culture.  A half-hearted recommendation.	2004-06-20

Without having a feel for what role the ashigaru or the samurai leaders (bodyguards, commanders, etc.), I think I would have been lost reading this book.  You probably need to know how armies went into battle, in what order, for what purpose to pick up on the nuances here.  This book expands on the material aspects of the soldier only briefly touched upon in the other books.  Little detailed sections like &quot;Religious Symbolism in Heraldry&quot; and &quot;The Common People&quot; (with its discussion of how mon heraldry was forbidden to the people, kabuki)) -- very interesting.<br />Out of the Osprey books I've read or browsed so far, this one avoids the series' #1 sin:  recycling.  Most of the pictures and artwork are fresh so I feel like there is some value in having it.  It's a nice read to understand how the armies appeared on the battlefield, in their camps, in the castles, etc.<br />McBride's illustrations are perhaps the best I've seen so far in the Osprey Japan books -- very atmospheric; they remind me of comic book artist Frank Miller's art (Ronin, 300, etc.).<br />3/5 stars:  probably only for the history or wargaming buff.	2004-06-17

I've enjoyed Koike and Kojima's work in other manga -- but these stories are incredible.  I couldn't put the book down.  If you're reading this review, thinking about buying the book -- just proceed to checkout.  It is worth the purchase.<br />One reviewer commented on how the stories from the Dark Horse comics were different.  The guys at my comic store set me straight:  the owners of the series only allowed Dark Horse to reprint it in paperback if they did it THEIR way, by presenting the material exactly how it is sold in Japan (format, sequential order, etc.).  So you're really getting an incredible work of artistry here, held up to high standards.<br />The translation and notes (useful!) are really quite good.  I love the manner the original Japanese is handled and am in awe.  This is an awesome import from Japan.<br />My favorite story is the 7th, Gomori-juku Hot Springs.  Incredible mix of psychology and action.	2004-06-16

I have several Turnbull authored Osprey books and I think this is the one to own.  One reviewer on the site says the book does not pass the &quot;So What?&quot; test.  He's right.  This is a book ultimately less about an important (series) of battles than it is about the Legend.  Still, legends are fun.<br />Turnbull is in *love* with Takeda Shingen.  If you read his other Osprey books, you'll get a lot of references to Shingen -- so it makes sense to start here; Kawanakajima is the battle that displayed his strengths and weaknesses as a general.  The book here has lavish layouts of Japanese art and original Osprey produced artistic renderings.  Overall, the book is an interesting read, appealing to the eye as well as the mind.  The author is in top form -- there is a limit of both objectivism as well as historical detail (e.g., the fourth battle, the most important, probably should have been the meat of the book).  But you accept that with Osprey:  you're getting a quick, colorful look at a moment in military history.<br />Yes, there are redundancies:  Osprey/Turnbull recycles art and info from their other books; some of the photos are disappointing (real-life photos really don't help that much; nor do photos of pictures from other books).  Photos/art goes uncredited.  Sources are not always specified.<br />Nevetheless, I give it 3/5 stars:  not for a general reader, but someone interested in Japanese or Military History might enjoy this quick read.	2004-06-15
US	52996633	R2FMI6QGKR8Z4V	0826415474	374515542	Prince's Sign O' the Times (Thirty Three and a Third series)	Books	3	13	23	N	Y	"Like Pac-Man eating one on-the-beat pellet after another"?	I admire Matos' love of this Prince album, although I question his ability to express it.  In these 33.1/3 series, Matos' book cannot stand up to the superior Neil Young Harvest book, but it does surpass the Smiths-Meat Is Murder and Kinks-Village Green books.  In fact, what I hate most about the Smiths-Meat book -- namely, how  engrossed it is in personal recollection, talking more about the author and less about the music's place -- is something Matos does fairly well.  Chapter One of this Prince book gives us the setting for Matos' discovery of the album (13 years old? -- can't we get folks to write about these albums they discovered when they were a bit more mature?) and in doing so, conjures up the late 80s quite well.  The author's \\"place\\" in the album's musical history does not overshadow the album, thankfully.<br />Given that Prince hardly speaks to the press, Matos has done a fairly good job assembling material to talk about Prince and this great album.  It's not as good as the 33.1/3 Young-Harvest book, but it does a fairly good job providing the context for \\"Times\\" and helping us see the album in a new light.  (Sometimes this context is all too-Matos-personal.)  The voice of the book at times wavers from a personal tone, to a historical tone, to a comparative-contextual one.  Is this editorial pressure, or a lack of it?  Although I can forgive the wavering tone of the book, I cannot forgive Matos' imprecise wording (like the quote from my review title).  I found myself lost:  what does the adjective \\"Camille\\" mean?<br />All of these stylistic inconsistencies detracted from what should be the main point of the book:  to get you to listen to the record and hear it in a fresh way.  Although some of Matos' explications of the songs are good (Housequake, Sign, Cross, Hot Thing/It), others are not (If..Girlfriend, Adore, Strange Relationship).  At times, his criticism becomes too murky.  Matos is good when he is retroactively contextualizing the songs with the87/88 music scene (George Michael, Janet Jackson, hip-hop).  His writing is less helpful when he adds his too personal metaphors as his sole aid in explaining the songs (although I loved his take on Starfish.)<br />Overall, it's a nicely condensed retrospective look back on Prince.  The author's lack of bias against Prince's 90s material is refreshing and helpful.  I wish 33.1/3 had gotten him to write about \\"Emancipation\\".  \\"Sign\\" is not a perfect album, but for all it's quirks, it's an interesting album.  One could say the same for Matos' book.	2004-05-11

For anyone interested in exploring a new film from the BFI series, then by all means see this film (readily available in DVD in the UK, sadly only VHS here in the US) and read this book.<br />Breakwell's approach is somewhat standard:  he discusses the arty look of the movie, its incredible design features, and the paradox of the gender of the actor (playing a double+ role).  I wish this book had been better researched -- adding more insight about Ichikawa Kon, his scriptwriter Wada Natto, and the actor Hasegawa Kazuo (or at least a more thorough comparison with Kinugasa's earlier film trilogy from which Ichikawa based this remake on).  Despite its lack of scholarship, the book is infused with the author's renewed appreciation for the film -- that being said, he does a good job reconnecting one with the film.  I definitely want to see it again after reading the book.<br />Problems with the book:  the photo reproductions of film stills are somewhat poor -- it's like someone took a photo of a t.v. showing the film.  Sad.<br />If you want to read a GREAT BFI film book, try Salman Rushdie's &quot;Wizard of OZ&quot; -- that should be the standard for every book in this series.  Sadly, Breakwell's book doesn't measure up (although Ichikawa's film is superior to Oz, hands down).	2004-03-10

Oh, it's a wonderful book on the Wizard movie, too.<br />Rushdie, as outsider/insider, helps one return to the joy of first seeing the movie; he also provides some of the more delicious gossip and facts about this movie -- unlikely as I am to ever read a full book the film, Rushdie captures surely some of its best behind-the-scenes stories (yes:  midgets, sweating, original actors, and the slippers).<br />This book is a great read:  the author is able to remind us how so many good elements (the visual storytelling, Garland's voice, the lyrics, the political incorrectness) bleed together into this wonderful movie.	2004-02-21

I liked the musical context he gives us for country-rock and Young's contribution to it.  Especially fresh was the author's attitude of the album as not being a superlative Young album.  His critical take on the songs at the end of the book is not as enlightening as I had hoped -- it's really the first 50 pages of this 33.3 book that work for me.<br />The author should be credited for pulling in information like how often Young continues to play these songs in concert (context pertaining to Young's own ongoing attitude toward Harvest) and detailed information on the different CD (DVD-A) versions of the album and the merits and faults of each -- definitely helps one consider a new purchase of Harvest in the future.<br />Recommended for anyone who is a music geek or a Young fan.	2004-02-18

I was disappointed.  Maybe I shouldn't have been.  I wasn't too impressed with Marvels as well.    Overall, I think the story lacks strong characterization.  Superman has perhaps the best -- it's really his story -- but even then his character doesn't get realized until the last part of the story.  What you have are great looking renderings of characters that are essentially blank.  Wonder Woman has become a \\"hawk\\" because she was spurned by her fellow Amazons; Batman is older, but hardly aged -- he's more of a realist (as he always was) than the metahumans, but having to wear cyber-exoskeleton all your life makes you a grumpy man -- so he deals with the war on crime his own way.  As usual.  Waid's writing attempts to give the characters a sense of reality (notice the scene where Wonder Woman and Supes skip stones in space) -- but these characters were never meant for reality.  Some could say the same of Miller's treatment of the Dark Knight, but in the Dark Knight you don't have reality -- you have satire.    What Waid does right -- and I admire his work for this -- is visualizing this alternative DC reality.  The bat-drones, GL's emerald city, etc.  He has a knack for cool quips.  Vandal Savage says, \\"I never dreamed they'd return.  Not in a _million years_.\\"  Ba-dum-dum.  Nice play on the character.    Waid's ideas are realized by Alex Ross' painstaking art.  It's definitely beautiful, but I would recommend someone to pick up the 4 oversized books he did like \\"Shazam:  Power of Hope.\\"  In the final analysis, Ross is a great artist but he's not a great comic book storyteller.  His images are too static.  Looking at a work where he's fully illustrated like Kingdom Come, you feel like you're rushing through an art gallery to look at all of the canvases out there.  The story ultimately gets in the way of the visual enjoyment.  I doubt I'll ever go back and read the stories, but I might look at the art from time to time.    For those who love Ross' art, I would recommend the book not to read, but to merely pick up and turn from page to page.  It's a beautiful book, but I don't think Kingdom Come will rock your world.	2004-01-15

I enjoyed reading (in about 2 days) although there were places where I don't think Klock really made his point well (and I consider myself somewhat informed by Bloom's criticism).<br />My recommendation is:  if you are interested in an intellectual view of comics (90s, and 00s comics) then this book is for you.  Moreover, if you like Alan Moore's comics and you want to read an interesting take on them, this is definitely the book for you.<br />The problem is:  I don't like Moore as much as Klock does.  I admit that his perspective on Killing Joke, ABC Comics, Miracleman, etc., -- this stuff is good -- but I don't think Moore is nearly as influential as Klock thinks.  Yes, Watchmen is an important comic.  Yes, it did change the industry back in the 90s.  But to take Bloom's theory and say that Moore is the Shakespeare of the comics field, well, that's saying a bit too much.  Moore's not all that.<br />One amazon reviewer above hit the nail on the head:  Klock totally avoids dealing with Marvel comics (except to remind everyone how the Fantastic Four are getting grilled by Ellis in _Planetary_).  For someone like me who favors Marvel comics over DC (while admitting that DC has been the arena of many original comics in the past decades), this book gets a bit tedious.<br />Other problems with the book (which the author acknowledges) is his way of focalizing the _writer_ over the artist.  I feel that this project was only half-realized.  It seems to me that if you going to talk about the future of comics, you have to take into account the blossoming of writer/artists -- and maybe that's why he avoids Marvel and deals more with the DC writer + artist teams.   Only at various times does he talk about the layout of the comic page, but overall, the stylistics of the comic book get overlooked by the author which is a shame.  It is difficult to talk aboutsequential art (Scott McCloud gets a lot of credit for boiling it down like he has) -- but this should be the main aim of anyone discussing comics.  Yes, Alan Moore is incredible, but so are his artists Bissette, Sprouse, Gibbons, etc.<br />Bringing up Jack Kirby only to say that he was co-opted by Wildstorm as a character in one of their books isn't going to cut it.  If you want to trace influence in comics, it comes from there (or maybe Siegel and Shuster, or Kane, etc.).  Klock stresses the importance of the &quot;writer&quot; over characters, but he treats the Fantastic Four as characters with whom the third age (Moore, etc.) struggle to overcome -- why isn't it Lee and Kirby that they're struggliing to overcome?  Inconsistencies like this don't help the book -- I also wish the author was more consistent applying Bloom's theory and terminology throughout the chapters (some may appreciate this) -- and at other times he's far too abstruse (where was his editor?).<br />Overall, this is a good book. Not great.  Certainly controversial.  I mean, come on:  WildC.A.T.S/Aliens crossover is a starting point for the new age of comics?  Gimme a break!	2004-01-06

Tying together &quot;gilded age misfits, Japanese eccentrics.&quot;  The first chapter on John Manjiro and Melville has great narrative power, unfortunately the rest of the book falls into a poor mix of ties between New Englanders and the Japanese.  One of my big problems with the book is that the Japanese presence is hardly felt -- instead we have long, winding chapters on Henry Adams, Percival Lowell, Mabel Todd, etc. (interesting people in their own right) but whose ties to Japan don't have the sustaining narrative power as those like Melville or Manjiro.<br />Mr. Benfey's book is definitely informative.  I found his list of sources and quotations to be appetizing -- yet I could barely force myself to finish the book.  Its focus is more on what the New Englanders, ok white Americans, came away with from Japan even if it was the boiled down crack of Okukura's &quot;Book of Tea&quot; or Nitobe Inazo's &quot;Bushido.&quot;  Thank god Okakura existed -- otherwise, Mr. Benfey would have not had any glue to keep his American characters in this book.	2003-09-10

Please -- this is not a book about style.  It's a book about people who have no style  -- the have STUFF.  If you're looking for insight into the real homelife style of Japanese, in this book you're mostly going to be seeing only a blur.	2002-11-19

Students of Literature will probably enjoy this book not only for the skills, but also the reading selection (you're reading Hugo, Baudelaire, Bergson, Rousseau in the original!).  Students of history and science, have no fear -- there's good stuff for you too.  <br />How I prepared for my exam:  I read the book, but halfway through I went back and did daily review of previous chapters as I progressed -- things like the French subjunctive, imperfect tenses, etc are hard to grasp, but a little review and you'll comfortable with it.  Vocabulary cards and a thorough review of theFalse Cognates at the back of the book are a must.  After about 2 months of daily work (about 2-4 hours a day), I was able to read articles in my field with little difficulty.  Bon chance!	2002-10-25

Wolverine was a favorite of my generation as he has went on to become the favorites of generations of comic readers after mine.<br />Frankly, I think you're much better off not knowing where Wolverine came from -- how old he truly is -- where he got his powers -- etc.  Imagination -- the dark hallway where his demons hide -- a secret which Clairemont and Byrne and others kept from us -- is one worth protecting.<br />I feel like Wolverine has lost his integrity with this overwrought volume.  As the introduction notes, there was some pressure in the Bullpen to finally write the origin before the movie \\"X-Men 2\\" came out and did it -- and I can see why they'd want to make the definitive version -- and not let Hollywood have our hero -- but somebody should have persauded the Bullpen (and Hollywood) to keep it quiet, bub.  For everybody's sake.	2002-10-05

The Ultron one in particular is very good.<br />Unfortunately, Busiek stepped away from the Avengers a few months ago -- his work and genius (not to mention memory) will not be surpassed for some time.  <br />Avengers Forever -- a sort of sideways drift alongside continuity -- shows Busiek at what he does best:  keep the Avengers interesting within \\"the family\\" as well as punching bad guys.<br />This book is perfect to turn others onto the other Avengers books as it is more self-contained (although it in itself is a microcosm) -- it can be read without understanding the regular Avengers title.  4 Stars not 5?  There should be more Avengers Forever!	2002-10-05

If Lovecraft will go on in the 21st century to be one of America's great writers, much credit will go to Joshi for his incredible research, storytelling and critical view of a very curious man.<br />At times I felt like skipping around and reading chapters which tell of Lovecraft's life during the creation of a specific story (my favorites like &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; and &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot;) -- easy to due thanks for the great Index compiled for this work.  The whole book is very thought provoking -- even if you thought you knew enough about Lovecraft's life.  The disassembling of the (Derelith's) mythos too is good to have made official with the keen research Joshi has done.<br />Have recommended this to friends both Lovecraft-lovers and ones-not-necessarily-so.  An example of what a good literary biography should be.	2002-10-05

As other reviewers mention, this book is about a low-level Yakuza who specialized in gambling houses -- gambling was the mainstay of Yakuza income in the early 20th century.  I really liked this book -- it was fascinating and well-written (translated).  A very easy read that is informative at the same time it touches you emotionally.<br />Not a deep book, but it's refreshing.  Recommended for those needing a book for travel.	2002-08-30
US	52996633	R3CF93JSVPQ29U	0425158640	575127070	Idoru	Books	2	1	3	N	N	Idoru lacks characters or any real personality	\\"Idoru\\" is the third piece of Gibson fiction I had read or attempted to read over the past ten years or so.  His short stories (Count Zero, Neuromancer) are quite good -- enough to get me to pick up longer novels like this.<br />I was disappointed with \\"Idoru\\" though.  One reviewer here on Amazon suggested that the term Speculative Fiction be used now instead of Science Fiction for \\"SF\\" and that Gibson's is a good example of speculative fiction.  The only problem I have with that is that Gibson's work here is hardly speculative.<br />The Japan he describes in \\"Idoru\\" hardly seems 21st century -- rather 20th century.  \\"Idoru\\" culture IS alive in Japan these days and yes, it makes a great topic for discussion or a book, but Gibson doesn't seem to be stretching himself to make the book very Speculative (i.e. visionary) or even Science Fiction (SFfy) -- there's hardly as much cyber-pyrotechnics going on here.<br />The problem with the book is that the characters are poorly developed.  Gibson has two protagonists -- Laney and Chia -- which he reveals in alternating chapters -- and they do come together -- but the more Gibson actually involves them in the plot of the story, the more they fizz out.  The characters are much more interesting in their flashbacks (here is where Gibson's Speculative Fiction is really good and interesting).  When Laney and Chia actually get closer to the climax and goal of the plot, the less we care about them.  And the AI \\"Idoru\\"?  Boring.<br />I think the success of the novel -- and what would be of interest to anyone who might only have this Gibson novel around them -- is the atmosphere of this world in our future -- but not too far off in the future.  Unfortunately, people live in the future and the ones in Gibson's world -- when they actually live their lives -- are boring.  Gibson should write books like Proust -- Remembrance of Things Almost to Pass.	2002-08-21

Kojeve takes them too far but if you read this book with some knowledge of Hegel or another book on him, you'll probably do fine.  The English translation (of this French introduction to the German philosopher!) is very clear and stays with you.<br />Even though the class is over, this book will stay on my shelf for future reference.	2002-04-05

In &quot;Osen and<br /> Sokichi&quot; a boy finds salvation in a prostitute only to learn later the<br /> terrible price of sacrifice.  &quot;One Day in Spring&quot; chronicles the passion<br /> between two loves:  one which transcends time and threatens to literally trap<br /> others in the flowing lines of their poetry.  Finally, in &quot;The Holy Man of<br /> Mt. Koya&quot;--the best story--we learn of a mountain seductress who tempts a<br /> monk to forsake his vows and, possibly, his humanity.  Unlike Banana<br /> Yoshimoto and other modern writers who can only write about their boredom<br /> with life, Kyoka gives us a compelling description of the Japanese and their culture:  what<br /> they love to fear.	1997-08-12
