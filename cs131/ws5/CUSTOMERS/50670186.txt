I found that it was a little off beat from classicaly Jungian thought, but not in any serious ways.  I found his discussion of projecting ones shadow to be a great introduction.  If however you have read Jung himself you will find the ideas fairly basic.  The real strength of this work is the authors ability to reduce complex concepts into a form which can be so easily read.<br />The biggest error a reader can make is to try to read the book as a step-by-step manual.  This book should be read for the big picture which appears when all of the details are assembled, otherwise the apparent contradictions will become very confusing.  The reader would do well to remember that any discussion on the shadow is a discussion of opposites.  You must therefore be able to focus on both opposites to understand the essence of the shadow.  If you read other reviews you will notice that at least one of the reviewers seemed to be unable to make this leap.<br />I was surprised with the authors heavy use of Christian symbols.  Normally Jungians draw from several spiritual systems with thier systems, but I suppose it fits with Christianities repeated attempts to demonize the shadow in the first place.	2003-10-29

The lessons and techniques he presents are clear, simple and straight forward.  This book was actually my first step into the world of Magick. Before reading this I was just curious, after reading this I am practicing and amazed with what I have seen.<br />My only problem with the book is its focus on the practicals.  There is a lot of time spent on &quot;how-to&quot;.

The reason I say this is because they seem to be focused on what could go wrong.  This is not a touchy feely book about the beauty of parenthood, this is a clinical description of what could happen.  Most people I know that read this book were terrified.  It talks about absolutely everything that could go wrong.  As though I need help worrying about our child to be.  I appreciate the information, but I dont want to have nightmares about it!  The author states that these things are often unlikely, however the book focuses on terrible, terrible things that could happen.  You will walk away from this book like a new medical student, it will seem like everyone around you has the disorder that you just read about.  Needless to say this can be frightening!  <br />I admit that the information is acurate, but it is misleading in that it puts the focus on what could go wrong and not what could go right or even what you could do about it.  If you dont get frightened easily you might be able to handle this book, if you are in the least bit nervous about your child then you probably dont want to use this resource.<br />Bottom line, this book scared me more then any Stephen King novel...	2001-11-04

Clark is shown in the gritty special ops world that we always new he had in him.  Clancy takes Clark and fleshes him out in ways that he was never able to do in previous novels.  This story is not a &quot;political thriller&quot; the way that Jack Ryans stories might be called, this is an action story.

I have long had the trouble of finding a modality that effectivly works with personality disorders.  I bought this book in an attempt to bridge my knowledge from purely Axis I to include Axis II disorders.  <br />The book goes through each and every personality disorder one at a time.  This made it very easy to research one specific problem without having to sift through pages and pages of irrelevant information for the task at hand.<br />Within each chapter Beck defines the typical automatic thoughts, or faulty reasoning, that is commonly associated with the personality disorders.  He then gives broad treatment plans and goals to deal with the symptoms.  <br />Beck is very well organized and succienct.  You will walk away from even a short reading of this book feeling more confident and better equipped to deal with the disorders without the usually doubts that maybe you didnt get the whole gist of what the author was trying to say.<br />I felt that this was extremely well done.  I also appreciate that Beck does not promise more then he can deliver and he is the first one to say that outcomes for Axis II disorders are still poor compared with Axis I.	2001-11-04

But I had to admit I have been a little disapointed with her last few books.  Many of them read like biographies more then stories.  I longed for the tales of Lestat where he was unafraid to use his power and we could all revel in his abilities with him.  She has finally come back to that.  Blood and Gold is hardly action packed, but it does feature a vampire who is accostumed to flexing his muscle form time to time.  This is the story of Marius that picks up after where we last saw him in &quot;Pandora.&quot;  This story covers centuries and fills in the blanks that we left in this intriguing character.  <br />I am glad the Anne finally focused on the vampire and not the biography and history.  Thank you Anne.	2001-10-29

This is the story of Vittorio and is initially set in the middle ages.  This story is more mystical then many of Anne other books, at least in a very different way.  Vittorio can see angels.  They are unwilling companions in his quest to free his love from other vampires while still killing the rest of the vampires who are praying on a village.  This book has several deep moral subthemes such as what sacrifices must be made for the greater good and choosing the lesser of two evils.  Also the idea of powerful, but nearly inept divine agents.  The angels were powerful, but hardly flawless.<br />There is absolutely NO guest appearances from the vampires that we know so well.  This story uses the same &quot;setting&quot; as the rest of the vampire novels, but all of the characters are new.<br />Overall, I enjoyed the novel, but I admit I missed Lestat.	2001-10-29

This was my first introduction to quatum physics.  I am NOT a mathmatical kind of guy, so I really appreciated that it was in laymans terms and not in complex mathmatical hieroglyhics.<br />The author takes his time with explaining the very abstract theories and doesnt rush a reader along and leave us in the proverbial dust.

There is no comparison to any other game or system, period.  If you want to play with time travel this is the game for you.<br />The world however that the game is set in was... a bit boring for me.  I didn't like the political groups that the characters had to join, the history was unimpressive and seemed half baked, and I was left with the thought &quot;ok, I can travel through time... now what?&quot;  I needed a little bit more to understand the motivations of these beings.

That isnt the case.  The system is obviously built on top of the normal White Wolf game system with dots and combining a skilll and ability to arrive at likelihood of success.  When it differs radically was with the advantages.  They are linked to the skills, but look like Wizards of the Coast with the knacks.  Not close enough that anyone will get sued, but close enough that the influence is clear.<br />I am undecided about the world that they create.  The history is ok, but I was left without a feel for the world at large.  The descriptions of the cities was a bit vague.  I suppose that is what supplements are for...	2001-08-04

The survivors are trying to lift themselves from the ashes of the Week of Nightmares. This is their story.<br />This clanbook does a great job of actually recreating a clan. One of its key points is showing how the stereotypical Ravnos, a thieving gypsy, is all but extinct. The survivors are plagued with the same curse, but they break the mold. This book looks at the past history and culture of the clan but it also looks at the current culture which is much different. The Ravnos that seemed a little different from the stereotype are now the minority of the clan. <br />I loved how this book took a clan that has long been portrayed in a fairly two dimensional light and added depth and variety to it.<br />The flaws, in my opinion, are that the book focuses almost exclusively on culture and role-playing, its a little light on rules and new powers. Dont get me wrong, I loved the powers that are included, I just wanted more. Call me greedy.<br />If you ever liked the Ravnos before you will love them now.	2001-05-31

He explains that only souls who have forgiven God can go to Heaven and that is what Hell is for...  <br />Of course the reader is constantly wondering if this is just a lie or the real thing.

This is a cultural and historical study of the clan, from the founder (new legends about him are in here) to being the &quot;soul of the Sabbat.&quot;  The reader sees quickly that this clan has rejected their humanity and has spent the centuries exploring what thier true nature is.  It was a bit disturbing to read about a group so divorced from humanity.  This book will help you with your role-playing, by giving you a guided tour into the differnces between humanity and the metamorphists.  You will have the opportunity to play something which is alien from the way that you and I think.<br />The one draw back is that the short list of disciplines is mostly a reprint from previous Tzimsce books.	2001-04-19

You are able to transcend humanity to see the world through the eyes of a Celestial being.  Now dont get me wrong, this is NOT Steve Jackson being religious.  This isnt really a religous RPG.  Wuite the contrary.  It shys away from the dark goth that is so popular today and boils the characters down to their essence.  But even then there are so many ways to take this.  I am deeply religious and honestly I dont like to play demons, but I am also not offended by their protrayl in this excellent universe.<br />The only problem with the RPG is that the combat mechanics suck!  I get the impression that they tried to make it as simple as something like White Wolf or even GURPS and over did it, a lot.  It puts too much emphasis on certain traits and totally ignores other (in my opinion) relevant ones for the sake of trying to keep things simple.  There is a point of diminishing returns guys, less isnt always more...  It is so simplistic that you WILL want to redo it yourself.  There are some changes in this addition, but not enough.<br />Bottom line In Nomine is my favorite game after playing for 19 years... at least after I reworked the system.	2001-04-19

This is a great historical geopolitical look at the Middle East of the Dark Ages for Vampire.  White Wolf does a good job of showing us the Kindred of the Middle East who have been influneced by living in the geographic center of 3 major world religions.  The impact of the faiths is obvious in all of the clans.  White Wold has taken pains to accurately reflect the culture of the times and superimpose it onto the likely reactions of supernaturals.

This book is a cultural and historical study of one of the darkest of clans.  The focus is one the culture and the mindset of the &quot;snakes.&quot;  This book discards the worn out stereotype of &quot;Servants of Set&quot; and gives them more depth.  They are still his servants, but the are more... main stream.  They still have thier dark goals, but they are protrayed with more human motivations.  They are seen as religious, not mindless fanatical worshipers who cant think about anything beyond Set and snakes.  Set colors everything they do, but he no longer appears to dictate everything that they do.  If you read the clan novel, you will see that this clan book better describes Hesha, the previous work made it hard for me to imagine how a clan of fanatics could create such subtle schemeing sellers of secrets.  This work paints a picture that makes it clear.<br />The down side is that the list of disciplines is weak.	2001-04-19

I loved what Bercot points out about the differences between the conviction of the early church (year 30-300ish).  He doesnt hold back at all when showing how his own beliefs and what he was raised with were contradicted by the early Christians.  He is not anti-Christianity at all.  He considers himself a fairly devoted Christian but in comparision he also sees that he would be considered weak in the first few centuries of the church.<br />What bothered me the most was his weak ending.  I was so amazed that someone finally saw all this for themselves (I had to be taught to believe AND repent AND get baptised) but then he doesnt raise his own standard or call others to do the same.  My conviction is that its Gods way or the highway.  He ends the book with there is Gods way and then your way, do which ever you want.  I was very dissapointed that all his study couldnt change his life.<br />This book offers a lot, but dont bother if you dont intend to radically apply it to your own life.

That is only at first glance.  The powers and the system are based on White Wolfs other games, although the powers are VERY powerful.  The reaction of the world to the emergence of super powered humans who could be driven insane by their power is very realistic.  It has more of a dark feel to it.  The game is set in the &quot;golden age&quot; but the cracks are beginning to show.  Few of the Novas are motivated to become super powered boy scouts, they are motivated by love, greed, selfishness, pride, power lust, fear...  The same things that everyone is motivated by.  This game offers you the chance to explore a world stunned by the miracles that can be performed, but also that is still very much like our own and not one trapped in the 50's of comic books.	2001-04-18

What I love the most about it is the simplistic gaming system.  The combat, powers, and all of the other resolutions are quite simple so that you can focus on the actual Role-playing and one battle wont take 30 minutes!<br />The world of the vampires is dark and Gothic.  I am not the biggest Goth fan out there, but this has a good mix.  The game world itself is highly developed, but still allows enough mystery that the Game Master can take his game in any direction he pleases.<br />I consider this game a standard by which to judge other games and that White Wolf has raised the bar with this line of games.	2001-04-18

Her 23 previous vampire books (Vittrilo &amp; Pandora) were a let down for me because the main characters were supernatural for about 20 pages between the two books.  This one is different.  Blending Voodoo with the world of vampires allows the entire story to focus on supernatural characters.  From the first chapter we know that the characters do not live in our world of logic and security but in their own world of passion, death and the unknown having more power then anything.  I applaud Anne for returning to the story which focuses on the supernatural and not a story about a person where, oh yeah, one of the characters is a vampire...<br />Thank you Anne.	2001-04-05

In english, this book helps you to see how thoughts, emotions, and behavior all interact with one another for better or worse.<br />This is a good text, but its also 2 inches thick.  You have to be commmitted to reading this to get the real gems from it.  But yes, it is worth the read.	2001-03-27

The story is purposefully vague as change is always different.  The 4 characters in the story are archetypes of how people handle change: searching, activity, planning, and resisting.  I read this story not from a business perspective, but from a therapy perspective.  I have several clients that I feel could benefit from this book.  <br />Here is one observation that I made about the REVEIWERS:  If they liked it they applied it to themselves, if they hated it they just critique the story and find its holes they never look at themselves...<br />Makes you wonder why they were given the book in the first place...	2001-03-27

This story is a little different then some of his others.  It features Jack Ryan, but he is only one of the major characters instead of the main one.  There is a lot of emphasis put on the perspective of the special forces units, especially behind enemy lines.  The movie DID NOT capture the intense feeling of being both predator and prey that the soldiers experienced.  Its cliche, but the book ruined the movie for me.  If you liked the movie at all you will love the book.	2001-03-26

That means it has few theoretical assumptions and focuses on WHAT works more then WHY some thing might or might work.  This also frees that reader from having to sift well researched fact from the authors opinion.  The book is designed for practical application.  If you just want to read about anger this is not the book for you.  If you want to do something about anger then you owe it too yourself to check this out.	2001-03-20

I run a group for men with sexual addiction and this book has been invaluable to me in not only the planning but the implementation of the group.  The book gave me a starting place for treatment with a wide variety of issues all tied up in the sexual addicts life.	2001-03-20

He has taken the essence of existentialism without the dark brooding arrogance of the modern day philosopher to seperate from the ideas.<br />Emotionally, Frankl faced horrors we can never know and remained a caring man.  He blazed a path for others to follow by finding a purpose to live for and accepting both responsiblity AND freedom of choice in all situations.<br />In therapy, I found Frankls ideas useful when my client is overwhelmed with the question of &quot;why?&quot;  Frankls lessons have led me to ask the return question &quot;how will you respond in the face of this, even if you never know why?&quot;<br />His book is about philosophy applied to tradgey and the human spirit.  I highly recommmend it.	2001-03-18

The author offers advice on adapting it to be used in individual therapy however.  Linehan is forging a place in the mental health field as the foremost clinican in dealing with BPD.  The reader is immediately aware of the extensive amount of research that went into this book.  The author is not writing about opinion, she is writing about the results of years of extensively scrutinzing the work of herself and others.  On the downside the book has the amount and quality of information one would expect from a textbook.  This is not light reading, it is however a page turner (as far as academic texts go) if you have ever felt inadequate when dealing with BPD.      After applying the ideas in this book I found that BPD was not the same beast in treating than in the past.	2001-03-17

McMullin demystifies therapy by breaking the techniques down they are more easily applied in practice.  For each technique there are real life examples and application, research and his personal thoughts on the effectiveness of the technique.  McMullin also refuses to get lost in the technique and also describes the mechanism of faulty automatic thoughts in excellent detail.  This book is designed for especially for professionals, students, but might also be useful to someone who is actively involved in psychology as a client or significant other to someone in therapy.  After having read this book I felt much more confident that I would be able to handle situations in my private practice.	2001-03-17
