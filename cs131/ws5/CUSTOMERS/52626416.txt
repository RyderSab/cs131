Lots of Astronomy books have the cover flap that says it's for the beginners, and the first page has stuff even an expert who's been an amateur astronomy for years has trouble understanding.  Or you have the \\"expert tome\\" that doesn't know what the Big Dipper is, let alone how to find something in the night sky. <br /> <br />And yet, even though this book is aimed squarely at the beginner, there is information for even seasoned veterans to learn from it.   <br /> <br />I especially like that they tell people about binoculars.  You do see a good number of books that note them only in passing, and not how important they really are.  Binoculars are good for just looking up at the night sky.  Especially if you want to wander out to some non-flat surface area where setting up even a simple scope would be difficult, if not impossible.  Some of the weird sites I gone are swamps and grassland, and getting a mounted scope there was something I wouldn't even attempt.   <br /> <br />This is a book I would buy for anyone interested in taking up the hobby.	2005-07-20

It is simply the best backup software solution out there.  <br /> <br />The only two serious competitors in the marketplace are Legato Networker and Veritas Netbackup. They are decent for small (less than 100 systems that need backing up) installations. However, if you want to backup thousands of computer systems and deal with as few backup-servers as possible, then Tivoli Storage Manager is really your only choice. The largest disaster recovery systems in the world use Tivoli Storage Manager.  <br /> <br />Of course, it does come at a hefty price... there is a lot of up front time required when setting it up. You need to know lots of very basic information about the hardware and software that you are going to use TSM with. This then allows for a lot of power in how you deal with that data though. It can manage thousands of terabytes of information storage on thousands of computer systems. It is very powerful. <br /> <br />IBM Tivoli Storage Manager used to be called other things in the past...the best known being ADSM -- Adstar Distributed Storage Manager. The main mailing list in the TSM world is still called ADSM-L. Find out more info about it at [...] <br /> <br />This book is a guide to many of the TSM Internals of version 4.2 that any good system administrator needs to know about. If you are going to be using ITSM/TSM/ADSM... then you should get this book for the version of it that you are running.  The most recent version is 5.3. I highly recommend this book.	2005-01-13

He has been keeping a web-log for several years now where he discusses many subjects, especially about is daily adventures with building computers, managing a home-network and diagnosing problems with them.   <br /> <br />Probably the single biggest reason that many people don't put together their own systems is the simple lack of knowledge on how to do it.  This book provides a great introduction on how to do it.   <br /> <br />The best reason to do it for yourself is then you will have the piece of mind that you have quality parts in your system.  Picking good hard drives, video cards, motherboards, means you are less likely to have a computer failure.  Cheap parts are the major reason large corp. retailers put out a lot bad systems... they got some parts that were cheap, but that fail a lot. Thus, causing their customers a lot of headaches. Sure, you might get a dirt-cheap computer system, but you get what you pay for. <br /> <br />The other best reason to build a system on your own is that you will learn something in the process.  If you can build your own system you will start to be able to do your own tech support.  You won't have to wait to get your system fixed: you'll have the knowledge to do it yourself.  <br /> <br />Better than the simple list of hardware (which since this is a physical book will be out of date very soon after publication) is the discussion on how to do it.  The questions you need to ask yourself before picking hardware, etc.  What do you want to do with the system?   Do you want to play high-power games?  Maybe you just want to surf the web and do some light word processing.  The system can then be customized for you and you don't get one-size fits all system from some corp. retail giant.  <br /> <br />And don't forget about his web site.  He keeps updated lists of recommended hardware on it, as well as details as to his adventures of computer-problem land.  A lot of tips can be picked up there.   A good way to keep abreast of the authors thoughts and opinions as to the state of the industry. <br /> <br />Anything by Thompson is worthwhile.	2004-10-11

His essays regularly get posted to /.Shashdot.org.  Most, if not all, of the book appeared originally on his web site. <br /> <br />Paul Graham is one of the few good commentators on the current state of what are called hacking, programming, and/or the Computer Business today.  Of course, all of these are, in part, tied to the greater Internet geek culture that has arisen in the last decade. He writes about many varied topics, including being a nerd and programmer, running a business, and other more esoteric as well as down-to-earth topics.  These topics tie together into what could be called an overall theme of Internet geek culture or simply hacking.   <br /> <br />Graham is a good writer and understands his topics.  Those who claim he's jumping all over the place must not be members of the hacking sub-culture.  But this is a collection of essays.  So, multiple topics are allowed.  However, all of his concerns are directed at a narrow audience, made up of people in that culture.  So, outsides may not understand the context of it and see it as commentaries on a unified whole.   <br /> <br />As to those who commented on his politics... I don't know if he really has any.  If he has any I would guess it would be some form of diluted Libertarianism.  <br /> <br />Overall, he appears to tackle subjects similar to those taken up by Joel Spolsky (Joel on Software), Richard Gabriel and Jerry Pournelle of Chaos Manor (when he's discussing computers).  <br /> <br />Overall, Graham is somebody whose work I read on a regular basis.  I don't always agree with his viewpoint, but he'll always make me think, and that's more than most writers accomplish.	2004-10-10

His \\"History of the World\\" has become a classic.   He also wrote \\"A History of Europe\\" and this \\"Twentieth Century: The History of the World, 1901 to 2000\\".  Both of these later works appear to have grown out of his \\"History of the World\\".  That isn't a bad thing.   <br /> <br />This book is one of the best end of the century reflections on the 20th Century.  It is very much written from the viewpoint of a scholar. This is something that turns some folks off, which is fine.  But, nonetheless, it is still eminently readable.  Roberts has a firm grasp of \\"The Big Picture\\".  <br /> <br />This is the kind of book more people should read.  Roberts writer about all areas of the world, from Europe and America, to Russia, China, the Middle East, South America, Africa, etc.  In many ways, the 20th century was when, in many ways, the world stopped being Eurocentric.  <br /> <br />I would buy this book again.	2004-08-22

Joel has a unique down to earth view on computers, programming and business that makes his blog worth reading.  He believes in using the right tool for the job, and not just always using a hammer because you have one handy. <br /> <br />There are a lot of books and web sites on how business, software, computers and programming should be conducted.   Most fail to understand the basics of what they are talking about because the writer has a theory that he thinks will solve everything.  But the theory takes on a life of its own, and becomes more important than observed reality. Just the trap many political, religious and self-help demagogues fall into.  They become pie-in-the-sky dreamers and less attached to normal life. <br /> <br />He seems to have a similar, if slightly younger perspective, on the field as Richard P. Gabriel who wrote his now famous \\"Worse is Better\\" essay about 10-15 years ago.   Another writer/programmer he reminds me of is Paul Graham.  <br /> <br />Others I would compare him too, though each if very different in their own ways, are the writings and blog of Wil Wheaton, The Cluetrain Manifesto, and the rants of Fred on Everything (Fred Reed), Jerry Pournelle's Chaos Manor, and much that appears on /.Slashdot.   <br /> <br />Joel has not tried to generalize his very specific observations into a unified whole theory of all programming and computer management. But that doesn't prevent you, the home reader, from making those generalizations yourself.  You may have to prevent yourself from thinking too much of it, least the Law of Leaky Abstractions take over.  Joel gives one a good place to start.   <br /> <br />I've used his \\"Law of Leaky Abstractions\\" in discussions I had many times. <br /> <br />Also, when I was thinking for a job I used his guide to interviewing when talking to perspective employers.  Sure, he wrote it from employers to use, but I was able to easily enough reserveit's principals and applied them to finding out info about the company I was interviewing at.  This allowed me find out what the bad interviewers really wanted to know when they didn't know what they wanted.  It allowed me to show that I was smart and could get things done to the people who interviewed me.  And since I'm employed again it must have worked.  <br /> <br />Some of the best essays are: <br /> <br />The Law of Leaky Abstractions <br />Don't Let Architecture Astronauts Scare You <br />Interviewing  (The Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing) <br />Three Wrong Ideas From Computer Science <br />How Microsoft Lost the API War <br />Getting Things Done When You're Only a Grunt <br />Top Five (Wrong) Reasons You Don't Have Testers <br /> <br />It is definitely worth the roughly 20 bucks you'll spend on it.	2004-08-21

I find it to be very good as a general overview of history timelines with maps and charts.  It doesn't really dig deep; it is the proverbial two miles and two inches deep view of history.  <br />For a through understanding a reader should move on to other books. That being said any true student of history needs to have a good overview of things before they can dig into the details.  And this good gives a great overview of the major topics.  Which is why I would recommend it to people. <br />One group that could really benefit from a book like this, of course, are high school students studying history or social studies or whatever they are calling that class now a day.  A provides a way to understand an outline at a glance which is very useful for a student.   I know I wish I had something like this book in high school or even college.	2004-03-25

Only recently has this field of study started to truly recover from this setback.   It is **not** race-theory, but language theory and related folk-movements that most affect the core of the discipline. <br />This is the best book written on the topic for a general reader.  The common origins for the peoples of Europe, Iran, India is something that anyone wishes to have a good understanding of history needs to understand.  Many of the particulars of history are still obscure, even to the experts of the field, but the relations between these peoples all go back in the recesses of ancient history.  <br />One of the major problems of history is a simple issue, why is it so short?  Human history appears to, at best, be about 10,000 years. But the human species has been around for at least ten times that long.  Why the great gap there?  Indo-European studies can be seen as an attempt to push things back further into the past by studying out languages.  Sanskrit and Latin have a common source, that we can see by doing comparisons, so where is the common source? And who were those people that were the common source?  People want to understand who they are and this discipline is an attempt to try and understand who we are. <br />Of course, the research and thinking on the subject is very much complicated by the interactions the Indo-European languages has with non-IE languages, and even by those interactions that sub-groups within the IE had with each other.  None of these groups existed in a vacuum. Word bowering between speakers has happened throughout history, and this gives rise to many oddities.  <br />The author only mentions the concept of Nostratic once.  Nostratic linguistics is a theoretical idea that tries to ascribe the arising of, more or less, all language to one development or discovery at some point in the far distant past.  It is a much broader approach to the concept of the Proto-Language, in so far as it is looking for a Proto-Proto-Language or a common source to the various Proto-Languages.  It has a certain appeal to me because it seems to make sense on a very theoretical level.   <br />The reason the good author avoids more than page length of discussion to the idea is that it is very, very, very theoretical.  There is very little real evidence going for the Nostratic concept.  Of course, science - even social ones like linguistics - must confine themselves to the evidence.  Nostratic is thinking of things outside the box though, and can be helpful to think like that at times as long as one sees it as a useful exercise and not as a replacement for real scientific thinking. <br />All in all, this is a good book and I like it.	2004-03-24

I find the discussion of imaginary lands in the Atlantic to be very fun to read about.  The imaginary lands that never really existed were a symptom of something greater within the human condition: our yearning for a better place than we where are currently.<br />Of course, most of the lands that he discusses were just secondary discoveries of places we had already been too, and/or aspects of them got misreported, or facts about them garbled.  Frisland was probably just a misreported encounter with Iceland by somebody who wasn't aware or Iceland's existence, or thought he was nowhere near Iceland for whatever reason.  None of these would be out of the question, since things like accurate measurement of ones Longitude laid in the future and illiteracy was very rampant until relatively recent times. <BR> <BR>To use a quote that Donald Johnson uses, \\"The power of wish and the power of words are chief gods in the world of fable\\" - C. B. Firestone.  Meaning that sometimes people want to dream things because they want too.  And if they decide to believe those thoughts... while, it might not be healthy for them, like other vices, in moderation is probably okay for them.  <br />Later generations, and most notably British, French and later American navel cartographers removed the mystery lands because they wanted to know where islands really were, like in case you really need to make land fall in an emergency.  So, they cleaned up the nonexistent places from the old maps. <br />Beliefs in these lands made people feel better about themselves for whatever reasons they might have had.  Today people immerse themselves into less healthy systems at times.   Was something lost?  Not really.  We just moved our inherent yearning to other places... many have moved their thoughts to the stars and thoughts of other planets.  Some yearning of that nature can be healthy, but it can be carried to extremes. <br />I liked this book because it placed some of this kind of thinking into a historical context.	2004-03-24

The book is a good idea for spurring discussion of military history. I just believe it to not be executed well by Lt. Col. Lanning.<br />While I like the idea of his adherence to the idea that war is just politics continued by other means, and thus including a leaders talent for handing political situations... which is why he puts George Washington at the top of the list. But, it seems to me that this is really little more than an excuse to put Washington at the top of the list... for what I would think is really little more than his own patriotic belief in the greatness of America. However, I don't know if Washington really deserves the majority of the credit for the success of the American Revolution. The involvement of the French and the Spanish in the revolution, especially with Naval engagements with the British is at least as important to any of the campaigns in the colonies. Then there is the fact that the British military leadership in the American Revolution, on the whole, was rather lacking.<br />Yes, later as President, Washington did do much to put the fledging United States on the proper path toward greatness, but Lanning does not apparently consider that when ranking him number one on the list.<br />Also, I would not even consider folks like Saddam Hussein and Fidel Castro for inclusion on a list of Military leaders. It especially seems wrong to rank them above people of most lasting military influence, such as Saladin, Doenitz, Ney or Patton. Hussein was nothing more than a common thug and not a true military leader in any grand sense, and Castro is interesting, but I don't think him as somebody who is going to have lasting influence.<br />The inclusion of people like Washington, Hussein, Castro and others such as Hitler and Mao Zedong on the list makes some omissions seem rather glaring as well.Why no Lenin or Stalin or Muhammad? Yes, not true military leaders, but definitely very influential as political and religious leaders and with definite affects on military affairs. I know... the argument would be that Konev and Zhukov made the list and they were more important in the military decisions... but Stalin was at least as involved as Hitler, and more inclined to listen to them, which in the end made Stalin a more formidable long term foe, and Hitler's own Military leaders are also on the list: Guderian, Rommel, Doentiz, etc.<br />As you can see from my many quibbles, the book does start the discussions it intends too. So, that alone makes it a good one. I would have forseen a rather different list though.	2004-03-24

I have given this book as a gift to friends and family who was interested in the history of the middle ages.<br />No controversies are taken up in this book. The religious movements of the time (i.e. Cathari, Albigensian, Waldensian, Lollard, etc. that provide so much of the foundation for the later Protestant movements of Luther, Calvin and others), so important to a deep understanding of the period, are at best briefly mentioned, but even then more or less ignored. Of course, much of this is because later readers saw discussions of religions that weren't their own to be offensive, and American Protestants have often liked to think of the whole Protestant movement as original and new. The idea that &quot;there is no new thing understand the sun&quot;, why often espoused by people is rarely believed.<br />One thing I do find very respectable about this book is it discusses the affects both the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire and Islam had upon Western Europe during the Middle Ages. Too often, the period is thought to be very closed off and insulated from the rest of the world, when in fact the Eastern Empire and the Middle East had great affects on the culture and peoples at the time.

It also, self-consciously is limiting the extent it covers its subject, thus the limiting of 400 A.D. to 1000 A.D.  It is also limited in that originally the book was written in 1952, only with some updating done in both '67 and '85.  At its core is still a good framework for what was known on the subject in 1950.<br />All that said it does provide a good little introduction to the topic of post-Roman Barbarian folk movements. The major tribes involved in those movements in Western Europe were the Franks, Goths, Lombards, and a few others.  Because of the historical record being a lot of Swiss-cheese, with writers from the past often confusing one tribe for another, or using words for Goth or Frank as a generic term meaning \\"Any German dude\\" complicates the modern understanding of the situation. <br />The major reason people find the study of these folk movements and invasions confusing is because even the people writing about it at the time, the Roman-Celtic peoples living in Italy, Spain and France were confused by it.  This has lead to history scholars being confused about it to a certain extent.  Naturally enough, this leads to a lot of confusion among laypersons on the subject.  <br />This is only a good introduction though.  If you are seriously interested in any of the tribes in particular, then you may wish to look elsewhere.  But for an understanding of some of the major interrelationship disputes the various tribes had with the Romans and each other, then this provides a good starting point.  <br />Of particular value is the books endnotes and bibliography.  These provide direction for the person looking to continue and learn more about the topics and issues raised herein.	2004-03-23

But a very good fine little bit of weirdness.  <br />First, it is not as much an all-encompassing book about Christian Heretics and Heresies, as a catalog of major European ones from the Dark and Middle Ages.  Christianity have changed and evolved over the years to include and exclude odd-groups of people at times.  <br />Where the author has the most difficulty is in nailing-down what the, in many cases, now eliminated sect actually believed in.  This is where some of it gets real hazy, because often the groups that may have had similar surface beliefs but gotten them from radically different sources.   <br />A good example of this is probably in two major dualistic sects of: the Italian Cathari movement and the southern French Albigensians.  Both became rather large minorities within greater Catholicism, but the Albigensians probably had, at its most inner core, a heart of Manichaeism (another religion that was a very early competitor to Christianity, St. Augustine at an early part of his life had been one), where as the Cathar movement was more a back-to-basics purity movement, probably influenced by a very early form of Christianity called Gnosticism.   They get confused for each other because they worked together against what they saw as their common enemy: the Roman Catholic officialdom.  And then there was the Eastern Bogomils as well, also with similar surface beliefs.  They probably helped give rise to the Cathari in Italy... but, how close where they in core basic belief... well... we can't be positively sure.<br />At issue, lets think of it this way... Modern forms of Christianity: Orthodoxy, Catholicism and Protestantism all share some very basic beliefs, but also have some very large disagreements amongst themselves.  Outsides often have trouble figuring out what surface disagreements and what are core disagreements.  Well, looking at the various heresies of the past, we may have trouble noticing core disagreements because, in practice, they often cooperated with each other, and looked and acted much the same.  It also does help that those who fought against them often couldn't seem to tell the difference themselves.  <br />Of course, there is the added problem that most of the writings the various groups may have had were destroyed by the Catholic higharcy that, in the end, suppressed them. So, what is left often is either what the oppressors either missed or thought didn't matter.  It is material that may not represent a true cross section of what the groups truly believed.  <br />The book provides a good introduction to the various topics.  He covers the major European topics.  There are some over sights; he doesn't mention either Zoroastrism or Islam. He covers Mani and Manichaeism, but doesn't really discuss its roots in Zoroastrism.  Also, Islam had a big affect on Christianity in many ways and places. There were some weird sects that tried to combine aspects of Islam and Christianity in Spain, Southern Italy, and later in Southeastern Europe, that could have been covered.  A lot of this may have been cut because the book is short, and I guess that was on purpose, and therefore was swept out for brevity.  <br />The author also covers the leaders and prophets of these and other groups.  The book also covers aspects of other things... witchcraft, the Spanish Inquisition, biblical fine points over which scholars used to debate for centuries, etc.  <br />Still, I like this book very much.   Religious splintering is not a new event in Christendom, but something with a very long history.  Understanding it can help one understand our place in the world more effectively.	2004-03-23

Coffee has had a major impact on the United States, from our very beginnings in the Boston Tea Party to our present day position in the land of 24-hour a day television, which of course really means 24 hours a day of advertising.   <br />How has this affected our place in the world?  Americans drink a lot of coffee to get a quick pick me up. And that mood enhancing aspect is also included in similar products... those similar products include Cola, Tea, and all sorts of tricked out street drugs designed to make us feel better about who or what we are.  Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing really isn't important to the discussion at this level, just that we are aware of it.<br />Coffee has also affected our political dealing with the rest of the world, be it our weird love-hate relationship with South and Central America as a source of coffee, and more currently various illegal drugs.  If we weren't buying it they wouldn't be selling it to us.  It has also entered into all kinds of health topics and considerations. <br />Coffee has had a major social and political impact on the Untied States.  We use it, and similar products and drugs for various reasons.  We threaten political and military consequenences to those who have provided us those things. The \\"pick me up\\" aspect makes possible a longer workday for workers in modern society... and this can have productivity increases for companies and people. The advertising methods, those in many ways were invented to \\"push\\" coffee are everywhere in our social framework. <br />And we haven't gotten to coffee's health affects. Is coffee good for you?  A simple question that doctors isstill trying to properly answer. It has some kind of health impact on our people, but what and how and why are still, in many ways, to be answered. <br />There is a lot to be said, and my rambling review gives an idea of the many topics this most excellent book covers.  <br />But most importantly, the author tells one how to brew a good cup of coffee.	2004-03-19
US	52626416	R38UFC2S94K2CY	1556433271	73024751	3: Killdozer!: Volume III: The Complete Stories of Theodore Sturgeon	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Ted Sturgeon was one of SF's best writers	Theodore Sturgeon is the best writer of short story science fiction.  In a field such as science fiction, one of the few places where short stories continue to be regular features of the literary landscape, this is a high honor.  This is a simple statement of fact. Ask any of the Giants, the other great short story writers of the field: Ray Bradbury, Harlan Ellison, Robert Silverberg, etc.  They would each be more than willing to acknowledge Sturgeon as the best.  Isaac Asimov wrote of his high opinions of Ted Sturgeon's body of work in his own autobiography.<br />I have always recommended the works of Sturgeon to people who want to get a feel for a more literary style of SF.  Some people don't get Isaac Asimov or Arthur C. Clarke because they aren't normal \\"literary faire\\" to them.  This is, at times, due to these people being educated beyond their own intelligence, but well... it is something that SF has had to deal with from the uninitiated.  But Sturgeon is some one, along with some other SF luminaries like Ursula Le Guin and Harlan Ellison, even these so-called literary snobs have to recognize as a great writer. As a general rule, any English teachers who don't see SF as real writing will acknowledge Sturgeon as a great writer.<br />This book is part of a series of the complete short stories from Theodore Sturgeons career.  It contains a few of his best and most famous short stories: \\"Medusa\\", \\"Killdozer!\\" and \\"Mewhu's Jet\\".  It also contains a few of my own personal favorites with \\"The Bones\\", \\"Blabbermouth\\" and \\"Memorial\\". <br />Most of all, what we have with this book is a collection of where Sturgeon was at as a writer right before and during World War Two.  WW2 was, naturally enough - as with all the other writers of his generation, the major factor on Sturgeon's later work... especially the effects of the atomic bomb and how it might affect later society - only at a more personal level than people normally think about.  SF writers are rarely all about technical things... the technical and scientific aspects of issues are important to SF people because they are important to society.  But Sturgeon was always affected at the level where science and technology interact with how we are friends and lovers with each other.  You start to see that streak, which later cumulates with critical mass in his novel \\"More than Human\\", early on here with the story \\"Memorial\\".  <br />Even those stories contained here, that would be by others considers to be not of the first rank, such as \\"Ghost of a Chance\\", \\"The Hag Seleen\\", \\"Abreaction\\", \\"Poor Yorick\\", \\"Crossfire\\", \\"Noon Gun\\", \\"Bulldozer Is a Noun\\", \\"August Sixth, 1945\\", and \\"The Chromium Helmet\\"... they are all, at the very least, very good stories.  They're all still worthwhile reads today.  <br />What is truly nice about this collection of his short stories, which North Atlantic Books has so kindly been putting out with the fine editorial over site of Paul Williams, is the story notes at the end of the book.  Williams has dug into the background of each story, and come up with a lot of interesting lore about the fine author.  Especially of interest in this volume is the alternative original ending to \\"Mewhu's Jet\\". <br />The book also has quips and quotes in the notes from Sturgeon on his own stories and his writing and how and why he wrote some of them, as well related notes from folks who Sturgeon talked to about writing and the specific stories over the years.  Most important are some comments from John W. Campbell, Jr., the editor of Astounding Science Fiction back in the 1940's (up until 1971, as a matter of fact).  <br />Campbell is probably the single most important influence on all Science Fiction, and Sturgeons interactions with him were very important to his development as a writer.  Sturgeon later passed Campbell by, like many other writers, but he always remembered where he had come from.  Science fiction, unlike a lot of other fields in English literature, has alwaysremembered it's past, and Sturgeon was no exception. <br />Unfortunately, the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA) does not make people Grand Masters of the field posthumously.  This has lead to Sturgeon never being inducted and hailed as a Grand Master because he had the misfortune to die before they got around to honoring him.  This over site, along with those of Philip K. Dick, E. E. \\"Doc\\" Smith and John W. Campbell, Jr. and a few others should be a major issue to those who remember and revere the memory of Ted Sturgeon. This is something that the SFWA should correct at some point.  Sooner is always better than later. <br />If you are into good shorts, then this is a very worthwhile collection to own and read.	2004-03-19

No, the most powerful force in the modern world, those who weald power like wizards of legend, that can do the most damage to your life, career, family, and standing in modern society are History Professors at Colleges and Universities. <br />Yep, some low-level flunky history professor at a community college welds more power and sway in the modern world than the President of Russia or Bill Gates.  Well, to say the least I was very surprised to find this out.  <br />Huyghe has also written on UFO's, Bigfoot, and Dinosaurs that live in your own backyard.  Don't worry, the History professors, in league with top scientists at NASA, have brainwashed you so that you don't see the dinosaurs in your backyard.  Which, I must say makes me very thankful.  After all, dinosaurs are quite scary looking and I wouldn't want to have to see them. <br />These same history professors have been weaving a complicated game with history too.  They want to keep Columbus in his place as the Grand discoverer of America and the new world.  Why?  I think it has something to with the coffee futures market... I am not exactly sure.  Huyghe never really explains why the evil History Professors are in league with the Devil, the Republican Party and the Wal-Mart Corporation to make sure that he retains this place in the history books.  <br />Okay, I've had some rhetorical fun now.  Now, to get serious... <br />Everybody who knows a little modern history knows that Columbus was not the first white man to \\"Discover\\" America or the new world.  It is well known that some Dane named Leif Erickson got to his Vineland (a.k.a. Newfoundland) around 1000 A.D., and maybe even some good Irish monk, the Venerable St. Brendan, might have made it to North America in the sixth century A.D.   Probably even some Portuguese fishermen doing some fishing in the 13th and 14th centuries. <br />That all said, Huyghe has more than a few stories of an Irish Monk and a Dane or two, he has whole Chinese navel fleets, African navel forces, a Roman or two, some Welsh dudes, and a whole bunch of others traipsing all over North America, South America, and throughout the Canadian Arctic.  You would think that Ireland, China, Japan and Africans would have left a few real traces behind.  Heck, one would expect the remains of a large visitors bureau to be found in Arkansas or maybe Colorado where the millions of African, Asian, European and Space Alien visitors would have to check in while during their stay in the New World.  After all, lord knows they must have out numbered the locals (the ancestors of those Native Americans), who appear to never notice all these travelers in their land. <br />All right, I know I'm going for the rhetorical flourish again -- I admit it.  <br />I would be willing to even accept than a few Chinese and Romans wandered around doing... I don't know... exploring or something.  But they were not opening Space Ports for Space Alien visitors -- I am sure of that. <br />Columbus gets the credit for the \\"Discovery\\" of the America's not because he discovered much of anything. After all, those Native Americans were and are here.  Just that his \\"Discovery\\" was remembered and followed upon.  All the talk of who was first, second, third or 754th to find their way here, is rather meaningless.  The most important thing is who advertised that the New World existed to the rest of the Old World.  And that person was Columbus.  <br />The book does have a few good points going for it.  It is well written.  Even if I don't like what it has to say, I will admit that Huyghe can write.  I just wish he would find something worth writing about. Anybody who can get me worked up to denounce something this much must have some good qualities.	2004-03-19

This book is his entry into the latest round of political/humor books that folks like Al Franken and Roger Moore have been putting out of late. Barry is more of a political moderate, where as Franken and Moore are liberals who in turn as responding to Right-Wingers like Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, and others. <br />Barry does make his moderate beliefs funny, which is something that writers normally find difficult to do.  The left and right normally are able to be funny by making fun of the other side.  Barry does it by mocking both, and neither at the same time. <br />However, his heart does not really appear to be in it.  I think this book is some publisher's idea of a direction for Barry to go in, in order to ride the latest fashionable book wave and make a little money.    Sure, the book is funny, but not as funny as you would normally expect from Dave Barry.  Because of that the book is somewhat short, and has a lot of bad jokes... I didn't think all the zucchini jokes worked.   <br />However, it is still Dave Barry here and the book is still better than most others written in this particular category.	2004-03-19
US	52626416	R3K4LB5JB8F1DX	0471356751	551549848	Scientific American: Science Desk Reference	Books	5	5	7	N	N	Good for High School Students and General Readers	This book, the \\"Scientific American Science Desk Reference\\" is a fine book about most of the major aspects of science.  It is similar in approach and form to Isaac Asimov's New Guide to Science.  But, Asimov hasn't gotten around to updating his book, most probably due to his death.  This book is probably a little more accessible to the average reader. <br />I especially like this books coverage of all the major topics, mathematics, chemistry, physics, astronomy, biology, geology, meteorology, human and animal physiology, and technology.  <br />The thing I like most about this book is its reliance on relevant history of the topic to teach it.  There are charts and tables of the various time lines of when and who made discoveries in the various fields.  The fine editors also included short biographies of the major people in each of the subjects, from the ancient Greek and Roman philosophers and writers, to some of the latest Nobel Prize winners. <br />My only quibbles would be the use of some terminology that seems loose to me.  For example, it's use of the phrase \\"Earth Science\\" instead of geology.  It does this to be open and accessible to the uninitiated, which is an admirable goal, but it is my belief that it can lead to fuzzy thinking in the long run.  After all, \\"Earth Science\\" can apply to planets other than Earth as well.   <br />My other major quibble is its inclusion of the Computer Sciences and Technology as a major topic, on par with, for example, Physics or Biology.  As a computer geek professional this is something that I, on the one hand, like as it shows respect for my chosen field of endeavor, but that on the other hand, see as a very much useless to the average person.  Much of the discussion of computers and technology will be out of date in a few short years.  I really don't think the average person needs to know the formal difference between a mainframe, minicomputer, and microcomputer or the right and proper definition of an operating system.  And the stuff about the Internet went out of the date about five seconds after it was written, let alone published.  Again though, our editor's kind hearts were in the right place.  <br />Staying with my quibbles of their computer section of a minute, I also want to point out that they are missing a few very important names from the field.  They have Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, and even have two of our fields fine Internet pioneers listed with Marc Andreessen and Tim Berners-Lee, but Steve Wozniak and Doug Engelbart are not mentioned at all in the mini biographies section. Woz is as important as Steve Jobs, and Doug Engelbart was probably the single most important person in the field during the last 40 years.  To quote Alan Kay, \\"I don't know what Silicon Valley will do when it runs out of Doug's ideas\\".   Only now is the field stopping to recognize what Engelbart envisioned in what is now called \\"the Mother of all Demos\\", or \\"the 1968 Demo\\".  Hypertext, networking, the Mouse, e-mail, online help, a Windowing environment, etc. were all thought up or anticipated by him in 1968.   It is disappointing that Scientific American didn't note him in this section. <br />All in all this is a fine book though.  It is worthwhile for those looking for something that is a good overview of science.  I would make a great reference for any high school student looking for general science information.	2004-03-19
US	52626416	R3H1GTG7X5NLNJ	0345347951	589013680	Childhood's End	Books	5	2	3	N	N	interesting book	\\"Childhood's End\\" is one of the best novels of the 20th century.  Arthur C. Clarke is one of the best writers of the period.   <br />Many scenes from this book have been cribbed into the public consensuses over the years via Hollywood movies, some good and some bad.  The most specific image copied from it is that of the giant space ship hovering over cities... done so whacked out well in the movie \\"Independence Day\\".  Of course, there the aliens were evil invaders rather than the benevolent Overlords.  Other ideas that morphed from this novel into Hollywood flicks were in the films 2001 and 2010.  Of course, Clarke was directly involved with both of those, so they were much more faithful to the source materials.   And naturally, Clarke's influences are seen in Star Trek, Star Wars, Babylon 5 and other Hollywood SF series over the years.  <br />The major question dealt with here is \\"where are we going?\\" as a species.   The weirdness is that many people don't like the answer Clarke attempts to give here. I, myself, don't find it an appealing concept.  I am not sure what I don't like about it other than that it seems Alien to me.  Very alien. Which is why this is great SF... Clarke makes us feel that we humans can be aliens to ourselves, and not in a normal way.   It is something that I think Asimov himself hooked into with his later Foundation novels and the Gaia concept... but Clarke did it first. <br />Clarke, along with other writers like Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein, Philip K. Dick, Theodore Sturgeon, Fredrik Pohl, Ray Bradbury, Harlan Ellison, and several others, made the future what, in many ways, it has become. <br />Clarke has written many other novels on, somewhat, the same concepts... \\"2001:A Space Odyssey\\", \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" and \\"The City and the Stars\\" standing out, with this novel, as, in my opinion, his best work.   Read this book for something that is more mature in outlook than the usual Hollywood faire that gets the sci-fi label.	2004-03-17

It tackles a variety of topics and attempts to explain them in a straightforward and balanced manner.  The book deals with many topics in pseudo science, from the standard Bigfoot and UFO faire, through the crazy explanations of crop circles and hypnosis on to things that may be legitimate science in some cases, but where pseudo scientists latch onto them and turn them into something that isnt as much science as an aspect of some kind of crazed religion.    It also covers several religious and historical topics where they have been known to intersect with pseudo science over the years, such as The Church of Scientology and the stone megaliths of Europe. <br />The largest flaw this book may have is at times it comes off as being too understanding of the topics it is attempting to, for lack of a better word here, debunk. <br />It is a more scholarly version of what Robert Todd Carroll did with his excellent The Skeptic's Dictionary.	2004-03-16

The problem this leads too, naturally enough, is that the people in a democracy loose site when their elected leaders start to repeat the mistakes of the past.  <br />Roman history is filled with people who made mistakes, often times for all the right reasons.  Caesar is such a personality.  Caesar would contend that he was simply moving to protect the people of the Republic from what was extensive corruption in the systems that governed Rome.   <br />Tyrants rarely come to power saying they are going to enslave the masses and restrict the rights of the average citizen.  They always claim, and in many cases truly believe, that they are moving to protect the average men and women of the time.  However, in attacking the rights of the powerful, they often end up also restricting the rights of everybody. -- Restriction of civil rights in order to protect and preserve them...  this appears to lead to parallels with out own times. <br />To put to this another way, \\"meet the new boss, same as the old boss\\". <br />Even after the Republic had passed and the Empire was in full swing, there was still much to admire in the Romans.  \\"To protect the weak and make humble the proud\\".  Not a bad motto, and they even lived up to it from time to time. <br />Julius Caesar, in \\"crossing the Rubicon\\" didn't know that he was changing everything.  The problem is that everything didn't happen on that day.  Most events that lead to the Empire had already passed: Sulla's dictatorship had been a defacto empire; the Gracchus brothers had tried reform before and been slapped down -- hard and dead.  <br />It is possible that any large scale nation state, given sufficient size and power, becomes an empire at some point. After all, if Rome, Britain, revolutionary France and other great nations couldn't avoid it that may mean that the only real hope is to embrace the beast and do it well while possibly making some good come from it. <br />This fine book provides a very good discussion of the transition period from the Roman Republic to the Roman Empire.	2004-03-06

I did give it five stars after all.  It is a great book for getting a good view of several scientists and their contributions to the sciences and engineering from the late renaissance period to modern times.<br />The topic our kind author, John Gribbin, is tackling is very large and no one book can hope to cover the entire topic.  Even, as is the case here, in a book of almost 700 pages. Gribbin has chosen to focus on the interplay among the scientists, mainly when he wants to segway from one scientist to another, and the social implications of their discoveries... including much on the political realties of the time.  Especially in the case of Galileo Galilei, where the political issues can be as important as his scientific discoveries.<br />I would say that the great weakness to this approach is that he focus's a lot of those who invented things, and less on those who developed new ways of thinking about the world.  He claims to be doing the later, and does do a good job of it at times, but he appears to ignore the implications of a quote from Galileo he likes to use a lot: \\"science is written in the language of mathematics\\".  Gribbin almost totally ignores the contributions the people he covers made to mathematics, and pure mathematicians have trouble even getting a mention from him.  For example, in discussing Newton he could have discussed Gottfried Leibnitz a little, but instead just mentions that Newton and him argued about who discovered Calculus as leaves it at that.<br />The second great weakness of this book is there is no quick introduction to the best of the Greek and Roman philosophers who did a lot of science.  Aristotle was thought highly of for a lot of good reasons by people in the middle-ages, and he was right about a lot of things.  It is easy, especially now-a-days, to think that the ancient Greeks sure missed the boat on a lot things. Aristotle gets mentioned, now and again, is passing, but I haven't even run across a mention of Archimedes (when discussing Newton and Calculus it would have been nice to point out that Archimedes came close to discovering it almost 2000 years before.  Some think the only reason he missed was the faulting numeral system he had to work with), Pythagorus, or Euclid.<br />Hindsight is 20/20, and the Greeks and other ancients got most of the things correct, especially when you consider that they didn't have many of the tools that the later true scientists had access too.<br />Then there are the two great oversights among great scientists that I think would have site well into the mold he was using: Pasteur and Goddard.  Not minor folks in the history of science.<br />Because he couldn't cover everything, I overlook these problems and still give it a high rating.  People should know that their is a lot of ground to cover in science and the history of science and seek out more information on the topic.  Especially since an informed populace is the requirement and basis for a democracy.  People need to understand how science and true scientists work in order to have informed opinions about many of the issues facing society today.<br />Still a fine work and worthy of anybody library.ng, but I haven't even run across a mention of Archimedes (when discussing Newton and Calculus it would have been nice to point out that Archimedes came close to discovering it almost 2000 years before.

The book is a good idea for spurring discussion of military history.<br />While I like the idea of his adherence to the idea that war is just politics continued by other means, and thus including a leaders talent for handing political situations... which is why he puts George Washington at the top of the list. But, it seems to me that this is really little more than an excuse to put Washington at the top of the list... for what I would think is really little more than his own patriotic belief in the greatness of America. However, I don't know if Washington really deserves the majority of the credit for the success of the American Revolution. The involvement of the French and the Spanish in the revolution, especially with Naval engagements with the British is at least as important to any of the campaigns in the colonies. Then there is the fact that the British military leadership in the American Revolution war, on the whole, rather lacking.<br />Yes, later as President, Washington did do much to put the fledging United States on the proper path toward greatness, but Lanning does not apparently consider that when ranking him number one on the list.<br />Also, I would not even consider folks like Saddam Hussein and Fidel Castro for inclusion on a list of Military leaders. It especially seems wrong to rank them above people of most lasting military influence, such as Saladin, Doenitz, Ney or Patton. Hussein was nothing more than a common thug and was not a true military leader in any grand sense, and Castro is interesting, but I don't think him as somebody who is going to have lasting influence.<br />The inclusion of people like Washington, Hussein, Castro and others such as Hitler and Mao Zedong on the list makes some omissions seem rather glaring as well. Why no Lenin or Stalin or Muhammad? Yes, not true military leaders, but definitely very influential as political and religious leaders and with definite affects on military affairs. I know... the argument would be that Konev and Zhukov made the list and they were more important in the military decisions... but Stalin was at least as involved as Hitler, and more inclined to listen to them, which in the end made Stalin a more formidable long term foe, and Hitler's own Military leaders are also on the list: Guderian, Rommel, Doentiz, etc.<br />As you can see from my many quibbles, the book does start the discussions it intends too. I would have forseen a rather different list though.	2003-12-11

But as I have grown older I've come to the realization that is has much more to do with their NOT wanting to understand.  It is easy to read, but not easy to understand.  It causes one to think -- no, to have to think.  One has to think about \\"Howl\\" if one reads it. It is one of those weird things you still think about years later on some lame Tuesday afternoon while paying bills.  So, most people avoid it so they don't have to try and come to grips with the affects it can have on their minds.  Football and movies are easier for people to deal with most of the time.<br />I don't know if this is a bad thing anymore.  People want to live comfortable lives, and if one thinks uncomfortable thoughts, then life can become uncomfortable.  One is forced into action to try and help right the wrongs of this world, and that is not easy.  Wrongs stay in place in large measure because people don't know how to fix them.  Sure, we can quote RFK and say, &quot;some see things that never were and ask why not&quot;, but saying things like that is the easy part.  <br />Reading, &quot;Howl&quot; changes a person.  Makes them uncomfortable, but it means to do that.  It is a great piece of writing.  It is probably the best piece of poetry written in the last half of the 20th century in the United States. <br />But beware; because it causes one of think of change.  Change can be good, and it can be bad.  I like to think \\"Howl\\" is good because it opened my eyes to ugly thoughts. True, ugly can be beautiful. But remember the hardest thing about change -- it is.	2003-12-03

To Cicero politics and government was not something that was just necessary evil.  It was, in the words of former US Senator Paul Wellstone &quot;...not about power.  Politics is not about money.  Politics is not about winning for the sake of winning.  Politics is about the improvement of people's live.  It's about advancing the cause of peace and justice in our country and in our world.  Politics is about doing well for people.&quot;  This is how Cicero viewed the &quot;games&quot; of politics and government. <br />Right now we have a lot of weird leaders in both parties who don't know who Cicero was or why he is important to know about. At beast our leaders today know that there was a guy with that name from the various history classes they took in High School and College.  Of course, our leaders today -- on both sides of the isle -- barely know who the American founding fathers were, let another Roman ones.  Yet our own American Founding Fathers knew whom the Roman ones were.  <br />Think of whom Cicero dealt with in the Roman Politics of the first century B.C.  There was Julius Caesar, Cato, Cassius, Mark Antony, Octavian/Augustus, the two Brutus', Pompey, etc.  This is not just a who's who list of Roman history... these are all people who lived at the same time, who knew and worked with or against each other.  The founding American political experience with so many great minds all working together was not original to history... rare, but not original. <br />Yes, Roman politics was a blood sport when it came to it in the end.  Cicero ended up very dead, with Antony's wife, Falvia pulling out his tongue and piercing it with hairpins. But in the end, even his enemies thought highly of him.  Late in life Augustus, who had colluded in his murder, said of Cicero \\"an eloquent man, and a patriot\\".<br />We need leaders who know the lessons history teaches.  One of the great lessons of history is the end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the Roman Empire. Right now, we don't have leaders who understand the difference.	2003-12-01

The truly great comic strips of the 1980, which include Calvin and Hobbes, Bloom County, and even every now and then, Doonesbury (who's true greatness was exhibited in the '70's), along with the revered Far Side...  Don't know what else can really be said.  There aren't many strips today that are worthwhile.  Maybe Dilbert and Get Fuzzy.  But Dilbert jumped the shark a while back.  And Get Fuzzy is not consistently great.  They don't make strips like Far Side any longer. <br />The greatness of The Far Side can probably be summed in the fact that Gary Larson never looked down on the people who read his strip. He always (1) assumed that people were intelligent enough to figure out what he was trying to say, even when they weren't, and (2) never assumed that what he was saying has great cosmic significance.   This, of course, gave The Far Side great cosmic significance.<br />To have all the Far Side in one place... can, if only for a brief moment, make this planet an all right place to be.	2003-11-03

The book is a good idea for spurring discussion, but not executed well by Lt. Col. Lanning.   <br />While I like the idea of his adherence to the idea that war is just politics continued by other means, and thus including a leaders talent for handing political situations... which is why he puts George Washington at the top of the list.  But, it seems to me that this is really little more than an excuse to put Washington at the top of the list... for what I would think is really little more than his own patriotic belief in the greatness of America.  However, I don't know if Washington really deserves the majority of the credit for the success of the American Revolution.   The involvement of the French and the Spanish in the revolution, especially with Naval engagements with the British is at least as important to any of the campaigns in the colonies.  Then there is the fact that the British military leadership in the American Revolution, on the whole, was rather lacking. <br />Yes, later as President, Washington did do much to put the fledging United States on the proper path toward greatness, but Lanning does not apparently consider that when ranking him number one on the list. <br />Also, I would not even consider folks like Saddam Hussein and Fidel Castro for inclusion on a list of Military leaders.  It especially seems wrong to rank them above people of most lasting military influence, such as Saladin, Doenitz, Ney or Patton.  Hussein was nothing more than a common thug and not a true military leader in any grand sense, and Castro is interesting, but I don't think him as somebody who is going to have lasting influence. <br />The inclusion of people like Washington, Hussein, Castro and others such as Hitler and Mao Zedong on the list makes some omissions seem rather glaring as well.  Why no Lenin or Stalin or Muhammad?  Yes, not true military leaders, but definitely very influential as political and religious leaders and with definite affects on military affairs.  I know... the argument would be that Konev and Zhukov made the list and they were more important in the military decisions... but Stalin was at least as involved as Hitler, and more inclined to listen to them, which in the end made Stalin a more formidable long term foe, and Hitler's own Military leaders are also on the list: Guderian, Rommel, Doentiz, etc.  <br />As you can see from my many quibbles, the book does start the discussions it intends too.  So, that alone makes it a good one.	2003-11-03

He especially likes the math behind puzzles, riddles and logical conundrums.  Logic and mathematics is the source of his thinking on the Skepticism he professes in his writings on pseudoscience, religion, the paranormal, UFO's, and other outlands of science and rational thinking.<br />This book is a collection of his best columns from Scientific American magazine.  It was of the good reasons to read the magazine.  Like many other things in the last few years, that publication jumped the shark at some point.  Gardner was one of the reasons to still read it for a while there. <br />Gardner, however, is not just interested in the mathematics.  The men, and history of the questions is also important to him.  That is because it forms a context to the questions and the discovery of the answers.  Context is very important to the author.  Without it, you really don't know where you are.  <br />If you like the writing of such good folks like Douglas Hofstadter, Jeremy Bernstein, Eli Maor, John Allen Paulos, Richard Feynman, Stephen Jay Gould, Isaac Asimov, Carl Sagan, Arthur C. Clarke or Ed Regis, than you will probably like the writing of Gardner.   <br />Mathematics is something that people don't read a lot. At least not recreationally.   Normally because they don't understand that it forms the basis of real logical thought.  A real understanding of the modern world requires one of the understand science.  And science that isn't, at least in part, based on mathematics isn't real science.  It is something more of our leaders should take a real interest in.  How can we expect our leaders to make good decisions on cloning or when-life-begins if they have no real understanding of science and mathematics?  <br />Which is why Martin Gardner should be considered a national treasure.	2003-10-29
US	52626416	R2YFXIYISVHFO4	0679785892	58271710	Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream	Books	5	8	11	N	N	one the great books of the 20th century	As with the movie, many people make the same mistake about the book and get wierded out by the heavy drug content into believing that it is about drug abuse.  But that's not the case.  The book is not about drugs, violence, sex, or the love generation, it is about something much more basic, as the subtitle says, it is about \\"A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream\\". That is some kind of sense of righteous destiny in a place where good always triumphs over evil and nice guys finish first. The book is about that, or rather the realizations that it's not true: the death of The American Dream.<br />Basically, most folks believe that it is their right -- as long as they aren't hurting anybody else... they pretty much should be allowed to do what ever the heck they want to do, even if, and maybe especially if... the things they want to do harm themselves. <br />Dr. Hunter S. Thompson, whose alter ego basically is our main protagonist, writes this book: Raoul Duke. The book was what Uncle Duke saw as a failed attempt at Gonzo Journalism... that had at its heart that sometimes the best truth is encased in fiction.  Of course, most fiction really is written as something along those lines... an author trying to find meaning in a crazy mixed up world.  It is just that here we find an author more self conscious of this fact than other writers we may be more familiar with. <br />Other books that are similar in approach to this book are, in the mainstream \\"Electric Kool Aid Acid Test\\" by Tom Wolfe and \\"On the Road\\" by Jack Kerouac.  But I would also point at SF's \\"The Man in the High Castle\\" by Phil Dick and \\"The Book of Skulls\\" by Robert Silverberg, or even Harlan Ellison's \\"Repent, Harlequin! Said the Ticktockman\\".<br />The American dream either died somewhere along the way or did it simply never really existed at all, and we are somehow just mourning its passing like a bunch of drug crazed wacko's in the same way lots of other folks on a long strange religious tripmourned the death of a flat earth? Many of us believed in The American Dream once, we were raised to believe in it. But then something happened... something bad? Nixon took office and started defecating on the Constitution? Maybe we just woke up -- grew up? Who the heck knows really, because I doubt we really ever understood just what we believed in at the time. <br />To quote a line from the book (from the wave speech): \\"History is hard to know, because of all the hired bulls*, but even without being sure of \\"history\\" it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine flash, for reasons that nobody really understands at the time-and which never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened.\\" <br />The book is in some kind of way, an examination of ourselves... in the way you sometimes hear that an unexamined life is not worth living... the problem is that, when we look deep into the inner core being of ourselves...sometimes we find nothing. Which leads to the \\"paradoxically benevolent BS\\" -- \\"the desperate assumption that somebody-or at least some force-is tending that Light at the end of the tunnel\\".<br />Which is why, in my opinion, a lot of people don't like or understand this tale. They are uncomfortable thinking about themselves in ways where the conclusion isn't clear and succinct. They want to believe they are \\"holding on to life firmly by the handle\\". They want to live in a world where everything makes sense. Of course, they are wrong. Or maybe, in the unkindest cut of all, they are perfectly correct. The world does make sense - and airplanes are supposed to crash into tall building and thousands must die in order to feed the egos of the small groups of evil men who run the world. These are scary places and times, ones where you don't need drugs or alcohol to be scared. But then maybe only the truly sane are getting whacked out on acid and heroin.	2003-10-27

See [...] and [...] for some good stuff. <br />Bloom County dealt with political and social issues in original and novel ways. He didn't shy away from issues, and always dealt with things in a nice and funny way. Lovable Opus the Penguin became the soul of the strip.  The plush Opus dolls I still own to this day are some of my favorite possessions. <br />Yes, it does look a lot like Gary Trudeau's Doonesbury. But Breathed was not copying it, but satirizing it and paying homage to it at the same time.  Especially the way Milo Bloom played when compared to the Doonesbury's Uncle Duke... who Trudeau was just spoofing off from the real life Dr. Hunter S. Thompson (author who is most famous for his quasi-novel &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;).<br />However, my favorite character was Oliver Wendell Holmes, the young computer hacker who fought apartite in South Africa through his invention, which was going to turn all the white people in South Africa black. Then there was the time he basically brought down Western Civilization as we knew it when he hacked into the New York Stock Exchange and put &quot;A vast Ye mattes, Bank of America's about to go belly up&quot; across the ticker.  He got a well deserved spanking for that.  <br />Most important to me, however, Bloom County forms one of the great memories I have from High School.  Reading Bloom County and talking about it with friends was something I really have fond memories of from that time.  Maybe it was just something from youth that maybe you remember as a little better than it really was. Things like \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" by Douglas Adams and the Night Court TV series seem that way to me now.  Heck, I find much of Night Court to now be unwatchable. But Bloom County still seems to be very much readable to me. The 1980's in most ways basically stunk.  But there were some minor high points to civilization as we knew it, and Bloom County was one of them. <br />This book was probably the best of the regular collections.  It is good that I now hear that Breathed may be restarting Bloom County again.	2003-10-23

If you like to read books by Stephen Jay Gould, James Randi, Isaac Asimov, Arthur Clarke, or Carl Sagan, then the writings of Gardner will be something you very much want to be informed about.<br />Gardner writes about many varied topics in science, mathematics, pseudoscience, religion, psychics and the so-called paranormal, and other delusions -- always from a skeptical viewpoint.  If Gardner thinks somebody is wrong, crazy or foolish he points it out without hesitation.  He doesn't care if they are thought to be great people.  He calls them like he sees them.  Gardner pulls no punches. <br />Many of the essays in this book are from his column &quot;Notes of a Fringe Watcher&quot; that regularly appear in the Skeptical Inquirer magazine. <br />He has a curiously dry sense of humor that goes unnoticed by many who read him, especially if they disagree with the position Gardner is taking.  This makes for some rather colorful angry letters to the Skeptical Inquirer and other publications that Gardner's writings have appear in.  Many other of Gardner's books have included them in the past; we don't appear to get many of these exchanges in the addendums to some of the columns this time.  That is my only disappointment with this book.  It would have liked to see more of those.   You can't always get everything you want.  Which is a point that Gardner has continually been making for several years now.	2003-10-20

It is simply the best backup software solution out there. <br />The only two serious competitors in the marketplace are Legato Networker and Veritas Netbackup.  They are decent for small (less than 100 systems that need backing up) installations.  However, if you want to backup thousands of computer systems and deal with as few backup-servers as possible, then Tivoli Storage Manager is really your only choice.  The largest disaster recovery systems in the world use Tivoli Storage Manager.  <br />Of course, TSM does come at a hefty price... there is a lot of up front time required when setting it up.  You need to know lots of very basic information about the hardware and software that you are going to use TSM with.  This then allows for a lot of power in how you deal with that data though.   It can manage thousands of terabytes of information storage on thousands of computer systems.  It is very powerful.<br />IBM Tivoli Storage Manager used to be called other things in the past...the best known being ADSM -- Adstar Distributed Storage Manager.  The main mailing list in the TSM world is still called ADSM-L.  Find out more info about it at [...]<br />This book is a guide to many of the TSM Internals that a system administrator would need to know.

But 9/11 showed how important good disaster recovery planning and procedures could be to a business.  <br />Some of the specifics are now a little out of date, but not by leaps and bounds.  It is still very good for its core reason for being - Backups.  It is very much less out of date than other computer books on the market today.<br />I have been dealing with large-scale computer system backups and disaster recovery for large employers for years... and I still consult this book regularly to make sure have not missed anything important.

The first one I normally talk about is &quot;UNIX Backup and Recovery&quot; by W. Curtis Preston.  But where as that book is written from a core UNIX world-view, this book is written from a Veritas Netbackup view of the world.  Netbackup is one of the serious BIG THREE computer backup software packages on the market today, the others being IBM Tivoli Storage Manager and Legato Networker.  There are other software packages out there for backing up lots of computers, but I wouldn't call them serious... not matter how large of market share they may have.  <br />This book, coming from the Veritas worldview is a good addition to the small, but growing, computer backup book market. It is good to see all the general backup principles laid down in writing and then discussed in relation to Veritas Netbackup.<br />Myself, I am an expert with IBM Tivoli Storage Manger (ITSM/TSM/ADSM) and find the discussion of Veritas Netbackup good to know about.  I have had fancy titles in the past, but the usually boil down to meaning \\"backup boy\\". <br />The principles this book sets up for the reader are the time-tested methods of computer system backup and disaster recovery.   Many people would be amazed by the fact that even after 9/11 many large businesses and organizations are still not taking the principles behind disaster recovery preparedness seriously.   Books like this one will help \\"backup boys\\" who need to perform the tasks of protecting large-scale computer systems.	2003-10-20

It is not a replacement of religion.  It is a way of finding out things about the universe we live in.  Martin Gardner tries to explain this with every essay he writes.   He then contrasts the scientific approach with the religious approach to questions: basically accepting everything your teacher's tell you as totally true based only on faith.  Religious belief does not really allow for the concept that the people who tell you these things might very well be - in any way, wrong.  Science openly says, &quot;This might be wrong&quot; as an underlying assumption to all inquiry.  This makes the scientific method, in the long run, inherently self-correcting.<br />The title of the book addresses the question: did Adam and Eve have navels?  This is one of the big questions the inquiry into which religious followers have dealt... wasting a lot of time and thought on something that really doesn't allow for questioning in the first place.  There is no real way to collect evidence on the question.  It forces the questioner to almost make up an answer and then attempt to justify it one way or another... especially when you consider that many &quot;believers&quot; won't accept that the answer might be &quot;I don't know&quot;.<br />He then goes on to examine other new religions, like the UFO cultists, quack medicine, and various fringe quasi-scientific and religious beliefs from a multitude of places around the world.  All of them have the same basic response to those who question them: you have to have faith for you to see the righteous of our belief... while at the same time maintaining that their beliefs are entirely logical supported by externally verifiable evidence.  How they can say both these things at the same time and not understand they are contradicting themselves requires fits of mental gymnastics worthy only of those suffering under heavy self-delusion.<br />Gardner explores lots of these belief systems and responds to them in a truly logical way.  He doesn't always reach a conclusion, because sometimes the evidence does not allow for one, and Gardner doesn't then just decide to make one up.<br />Religion wants clear and succinct answers to all questions, where as the scientific method does not require them.  Which is the appeal of the new fringe quasi-scientific religious cultists.

Uncle Duke gives us the answer to that question pretty much right away.  &quot;Never ask that question unless you already know the answer.&quot;<br />The next question he knows the answer to is &quot;is this a great country, or what?&quot;.  The safe answer is &quot;Yes, and thank you for asking&quot;.  Any other answer will get your name on the waiting list of accommodations at Guantianamo Bay.  <br />Yes, as others have said.... this really is nothing new from Uncle Duke...  except now he is saying these things when, maybe for the first time since Nixon was in the White House, these are dangerous thoughts to have.  What makes this so good is that they are being said in the post-9/11 funtime jamboree that we call The War on Terrorism...whatever the heck that means. <br />As somebody who came to HST's writings late... As I wasn't born when he first started writing... I took note of him when I was in High School, if only because his thinking seemed to run parallel to George Carlin, or later... Kevin Smith in some aspects.   But of course, HST's thoughts are much more fully developed and reasoned out.  Which of course, while Carlin and Smith might flirt with respectability to the outside world, HST makes no attempt to suger coat his life, politics, thoughts or philosophy for outside consumption.  Which means he ain't playing the BS game most in the world play. Not to say he ain't BS'ing... Just that he plays more by his own made-up rules rather than those of others.   <br />He advertises himself and is thought by many to be a totally crazed out wack job.  Which, of course, is basically what he hopes is true.  Cause if he ain't crazy, then what he's seeing today in America is seriously down-right scary.   Which, as scary as it seems, makes him maybe the only serious rational person left on the planet.  <br />Which leads one to wonder if the outside world is just playing out J. G. Ballard's short story &quot;The Insane Ones&quot; for real. <br />Which, of course, makesDr. Gonzo the Twain for our time.	2003-07-27

Which is an attempt at a complete collection of Ellison's  work, I believe.  So far it is very good.  I have greatly enjoyed each of  the four volumes that have been released.  I am looking forward to the  other 16 volumes as well. Right now, they appear to be on-hold due to  publisher concerns or some such.  As soon as Ellison and a publisher get  this all squared away, the better for all us folks who want to read them  will be. <br />This first volume includes a lot of non-fiction essay's Ellison  wrote over the years.  In them, Ellison leans into everything he considers  wrong with modern society.  Because of this, if you are new to Ellison, you  may be easily offended.  But don't worry, he isn't doing it on purpuse, he  just doesn't care if he offends you.  He would rather tell the truth as he  sees it than worry about hurting somebody's feelings.<br />Ellison is a very  refreshing take in modern America, where Republicans and Democrats have  decided that the only difference worth noting between the partys is who is  in power at that moment. <br />Of course, it doesn't hurt that Ellison is also  one of the great writers in the modern United States.	2000-08-25

He also writes much more like a poet than other SF writers.  He never uses  too many words, and never too few.  He write to get a point across, and  succeeds much of the time.  Of course, because of this, when he fails he  misses the mark by a wide margin.  <br />His novels &quot;The Forever  War&quot; and &quot;The Hemingway Hoax&quot; are two of the best SF novels  of the last half century.  <br />Of course, after reading NONE SO BLIND, you  find that Haldeman does write poetry.  The collection is more short  stories, but the poems in this are very good.  My personal favorite of his  poems here is &quot;The Homecoming&quot;, which many in SF can very much  relate too. <br />But the short story &quot;None So Blind&quot;, from which  the collection takes it title, is here.  And that is a great short story.   &quot;The Hemingway Hoax&quot; is also included here, as is  &quot;Graves&quot;.  I am of a younger generation than Haldeman, and you  would think a short story set, more or less, in Vietnam wouldn't connect  with me.  But for some reason, it still gives me the willies.  <br />Haldeman  is somebody all intelligent people should be reading.  This collection of  short works is some of his best stuff.	2000-08-24

Richard Ganriel is best known for his essay &quot;Worse is Better&quot;  which is available on the web.  &quot;Worse is better&quot; has the  Corollary to it that is sometimes more understandable to folks: &quot;if it  works then it ain't temporary&quot;. This book contains that essay as well  as others on Gabriels philosophy on computers, artificial intelligence and  other aspects of the field. <br />But the book contains more than just his  thoughts and views on the computer field.  It also contains a what is calls  his &quot;Personal Narrative&quot;, an autobiography of himself and how he  grew up and why and how he ended as a computer scientist. It also contains  the story of the AI startup company he founded in the 1980s Lucid.   <br />Lucid, if remembered much today, is because of Lucid Emacs, now  XEmacs,  which was orginally authored by Jamie Zawinki for Lucid, based on the work  of Ricard Stallman and GNU Emacs.  Xemacs is the remaining gift that Lucid  gave to the computer community. <br />Lucid was a company that pretty much  failed, in Gabriels opinion, because of bad management and the &quot;worse  is better&quot; hold on the industry, because it had great products that  sold.  <br />This book, along with the somewhat different &quot;Fire in the  Valley&quot; by Michael Swaine and Paul Freiberger.  Both explain a lot  about the computer industry and how it works, and doesn't work.  Building a  better mousetrap is not a Guarantee of sucess. <br />Highly recommened book.	2000-08-20

Robert Heinlein is best known for his novels like Starship Troopers, Stranger in a Strange Land, Friday, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, etc. I list of his great novels being too long to list here. <br />But he started out  writing short stories in Astounding Science fiction (later to be renamed  Analog) for John W. Campbell, Jr. This book contains what is called  Heinleins Future History stories. Many of his novels fit into this future  history as well. But it all began with the short story  &quot;Life-line&quot;, which was first published in 1939. Is it a great  story? By itself, we probably wouldn't call it a great story. But it was  the first by RAH. <br />Follow-up short stories like &quot;The Roads Must  Roll&quot;, &quot;Blowups Happen&quot;, &quot;Requium&quot;, &quot;The  Great Hills of Earth&quot;, &quot;The menace from Earth&quot; and  &quot;Methuselahs Children&quot; are all also included here. All great  short stories set in the Future History. <br />This book does have a little  overlap with Heinlien's later Expanded Universe collection, but it isn't a  lot. Both are worth reading, and re-reading. <br />Heinlein was made the first  Grand Master of SF by the Science Fiction writers of America.

More for the updated and conflict resolved history of Oerth and Oerik than for anything really new.  Its focus is more on the city of Greyhawk than on the  rest of the Flanaess.  This is good for starting a campaign, but not if you  are somebody who already have long estiblished campaigns going on in the  World of Greyhawk.<br />The author being Roger E. Moore was a wise choice of  for this project, as he is responible for much good stuff to come out about  the D&amp;D game.  He wrote lots of articles about it and was editor of  Dragon Magazine for several years as well.  He contributed many of the  non-human deities to Greyhawk back when Gary Gygax was still manning TSR  and activily developing Greyhawk.<br />Is is good that Greyhawk has once again  become the home of the Dungeons and Dragons game.<br />All in all, a solid  product.<br />However, if you are a long time gammer, much of the information  contained within is stuff you already knew and either used, or didn't use.  Its one biggest draw-back as I see it is the aceeptace of most of the  enforced story lines on it.  The greatest stength of the orignal world of  greyhawk was that there was no enforced campaign historys.  But, you can't  just toss all the Greyhawk Wars/From the Ashes stuff either, I guess.  Too  many people using it.<br />But then, thats almost a religious issue amoung  RPGers. Still, its good that Greyhawk is no longer dead.	2000-07-24

Ben Bova also writes a lot of his own fiction, which fits in with the type of stuff that Analog is famous for: Hard  Science Fiction.   <br />This book puts forward much hard science fiction, a  little fantasy, and several non-fiction essays about science and SF.  It is  the non-fiction here that makes this book truly stand out though.  Bova is  very good at - not perditing the future, but pointing out where it is  Obviously going.  This is good, because very few folks rarely see the  perfectly Obvious.  Most politicians and so-called statesmen can not do it  when it comes to science.  Bova can do it.  He does it in the tradition of  Arthur C. Clarke and Isaas Asimov too. <br />Recommeneded.	2000-07-24

His novels like Childhood's End and The City and the Stars, amoung others, are classics of 20th century SF. <br />This is not his best novel.   Matter of fact, it could be argued that this is not a novel in the strict  since of the word. It's more of a long detailed outline.  Much it dealing  with the things like the the future of religion and the Catholic church.   Interesting commentary on it.  And not of of it as far fetched is it might  seem.<br />Space Guard is an idea that is starting to get discussed.  Mainly  because we now know it was a cosmic visit that took out the dinosaurs.   Humanity would like to avoid such a fate.  It will probably still be a long  time before governments and political leaders take up the idea of a Space  Guard.  But it is someting whose time has come to be done. <br />The fact that  this is good a great novel does not really take away from Clarke much.  As  Clarke off his game a little is still better than most SF writers and their  output.<br />Recommeneded.  More for the thoughts and ideas than for anything  else.	2000-07-23

From 1968 or so to the mid-70's Silverberg probably had the best five year run of any SF writer in producing great work. Novels like Nightwings, Dying Inside, The  Book of Skulls, and A Time of Changes, along with shorts from that period  like &quot;Good News from the Vatican&quot;... Even Heinlein never had a  straight run of great work in one five of six year period.  Heck, the only  similar run of great work in SF was happening almost at the same time in  U.K. Le Guin's work. And this is not to leave folks like Ellison and Niven  and resurent Fred Pohl's, Isaac Asimov's and Aurthur Clarke's out either.   The late 60's and early 70's should really be considered the Golden Age of  SF when we look back now.  And it was Silverberg was was leading the pack  then.<br />This book contains much of his good short story work from the  1980's and early 1990's.   There is some good to almost great work still  coming from the Typewriter/Word Processor of Silveberg.  His shorts and  novellas like &quot;Mulipules&quot;, &quot;Sailing to Byzantuim&quot;,  &quot;House of Bones&quot; and &quot;Enter a Soldier. Later:Enter  another&quot; are all of high caliber.  <br />I orginally found this book in  the library when I was going thru what I was catching up on SF.  As soon as  I have read it I wanted to own it. But I found it was out of print.   We'll... It took a while, but I finally found it.

Philip K. Dick died in 1982, and was a realitivly young 54 at the time of his death. They almost didn't quiet make  it in time to give the Grand Master award to Alfred Bester. They didn't  make it in time for Dick, like Theodore Sturgeron, Henry Kuttner and John  W. Campbell, as well as others. Phil Dick should be should be made a Grand  Master of Science Fiction postumously.  The Novels and Short Stories that  Dick produced in his lifetime are some of the best SF ever written. <br />The  Man in the High Castle is not your average SF novel. In some ways, it isn't  an SF novel.  It is set in an alternative history, which is about all that  makes it SF except for the way it tells the story. If it was not written by  &quot;an SF author&quot; it probably would not be considered SF by most  people . But it is SF cause it deals with large ideas that most other  literature wouldn't touch with a ten foot poll.  Basically, it deals with a  concept of what the future holds of humanity.  The world it is set in is  very alien to us.  Nazi's -- pretty much nothing more than evil space  aliens. Of course, evil space aliens that we are all too familure with.   (Lets hope they remain nothing more than evil space aliens of literuture  too. Once was one too many times for us as a species to play around with  things like Nazism.)<br />In the end, the story line kind of just ends.  It  ends with a esoteric view on things in the book. A world where Nazi's and  Japanese are competing in a Cold War that threats to flame into a hot war  at any moment.  Which all just acts as a backdrop... Ideas, the stuff of  SF. Nazi's and Japanese Facists in control of the United States and most of  the world... and it isn't even the point of it all.  The novel is more  about people trying to make their way in this world... andsome how we  might just make it through a lot of hash odds and make it all work out in  the end.<br />The novel has a very cautious, but in the end, extreamly  optimistic view of the human race and what the future holds for us. The  novel, like our real lives, does not tell us what that future holds... just  that if we play our cards right it can be a better place.  <br />Philip K.  Dick holds a unique vision of the world we live in.  It might be bad, but  even in the pits of hell a seed can take root that changes everything.	2000-05-03

It is part of the resurgent interest serrious SF writers have taken in the red planet. Bova with this novel, along with Kim Stanley Robinson with his Red/Green/Blue Mars  trilogy, and Greg Bear with Moving Mars, form the best of SF's revived  interest in Mars.<br />Much of it is a tad over the top.  But Bova makes it  work.  He attempts to show scientists are people motived by the loves,  hates, irritations, likes, dislikes, and oddities that make all humans  tick.  In to this mix he tosses some stuff about life on mars, and being  that Bova is a hard SF writer... it is interesting to note that he did this  before the controvial discovery's of possible life on mars.  So, he may  well have perdicted some things there.  But probably not, as it really is  just a plot device.  But he makes it work.<br />Worthwhile for lovers of Hard  SF.	2000-04-27

The authors name does appear to ring a bell in my head. I know the book was simply titled &quot;The Mongols&quot;.  I have looked around for it, and can't find it now. So, it would be a safe assumption that it is  out of print, as this book is.<br />The Mongols were one of the oddities of  history.  A people that conqoured most of the world.  Note, they didn't  become the rulers of just a large part, or all the world they knew about.   But pretty much all the of the world. From Korea and China in the east, to  Eastern Europe in the west. With Persia, Iraq, Russia, northern India, and  of course, Mongolia, all inbetween. Alexander the Great's Empire was small  in comparision... and Alexander ruled a lot of the world. <br />It was the  Mongol empire that brought about the downfall of the power structures that  held up the Islamic States in the middle east and persia.  China was  brought to a realitive low point in her power.  India, Russia, Poland,  Mummaluke Egypt, China, and the Byzantine Empire were all brought to their  knees in the face of the Mongols.<br />Also, the Mongols brought an early  version of free trade to bare from China to Europe and all parts inbetween.   People knew that folks thosands of miles away had good stuff to trade for.   The lack of political boarders made this possible.  <br />The nations of  Western Europe were pretty much the only peoples who didn't have the fire  and sword of the Mongols lowered on to their heads.  Because of this, the  back water that was Western Europe was able to reach out to the world, and  finding a lot of weak nations conquorer and control much of what they found  there.  <br />The Mongol's got bad press for years, as they were the stuff the  legends of evil hordes were made of.  This world would be a very different  place if Ghengis Khan and the rest of them were to have never existed.   Understand them is something every true student of world history needs.  This book can provide a very good start to understanding the Mongols and  what they did.	2000-04-27

It outlines all the major and  most of the minor scientific  discoveries.  The scientific advances that worked to give us the current  world we live in.  With things like nuclear weapons, global warming, etc.  It is super important that politicians policy makers understand science.

It was written in first half of this century, but in general still makes for a good introduction to history.  This is the  volume that covers basically what would be called non-European or  non-Western cultures.  It still contains a lot of information and is very  good.  The biggest short coming to the series of books is that it was  written roughly 70 years ago now, so any updates in information about  various aspects of history, sometimes get discussed as if they are still in  debate, or are not in general debate when they are now.  This time affect  also explains why he only has one volume on non-European history... Much of  the history of China, India, and other parts of the world have only become  known in the West in the last 50 yeras.  So, naturally, Mr Durant couldn't  cover things he didn't know about.  He does, more or less, acknowledge his  lack of information in some places too. <br />All in all, this is still a good  indroduction to history.	2000-03-29

He wrote the novel &quot;More than Human&quot; in the early 1950's.  <br />Writers try to change the world in a way to make it better.  Isaac  Asimov looked for more intelligence in the world.  Robert Heinlein for more  deliberate good work, not accidental, in the world.  Ted Stugeon, however,  looked for more love in the world.  Which is pretty much what all of  Sturgeon's great work is about: love. <br />It is probably because of this  that Sturgeon is still read today.  But not as much as he should be.  He  should be a writer who everybody has heard of. <br />It is sad that the SFWA  don't give out the grand master award to those who have shuffled off their  mortal coil.  Theodore Sturgeon is one who should be granted the title  postumously.  It is sad that he couldn't be granted it in life, but it  something that should be granted to him now that he has pasted from this  world.   <br />This volume of this series focus' on the early work of  Sturgeon.  Probably from even before he started thinking of himself as  anything more than a parttime writer. It is still good stuff to read  though.	2000-01-11

He goes into all the major arguements against evolution, and lot  of the minor ones, and exposes them as lacking in science.  He also  explains in regular language what the theory of evoltution is about and  what it means. <br />He even goes after Lysenko, the man who destoryed the  Soviet Unions own biology programs because he didn't have evidence for his  beliefs, so he had his friend Joe Stalin kill or exile any who disagreed  with him.  Some Creationists, like Gish and Morris, wish they could do to  their opponents, since they can't marshall a logical, scientific argument.  <br />People forget the much of geology, and therefore the entire Oil, Natural  Gas and Coal industries, depend on the theory of evolution.  You can only  find new oil reserves if you know where to look, and the theory of  evolution provides much of the idea of where to look for the oil.  In this  day and age when finding oil to use for not just gasoline and fuel oil for  transportation and heating is important, but also for all the plasitcs we  use... is supreamly important.

Campbell's Astounding Science Fiction Magazine.  In large messure, he  modelled the history in the stories after the fall of the Roman Empire.<br />Hari Seldon, Salvor Hardin, Hober Mallow are names that stand in the  history of Science Fiction like the names of real people in many ways.  &quot;Violence is the last resort of the incompetent&quot; and &quot;Never  let your morals get in the way of doing what is right&quot; are quotes that  every reader of SF knows well.<br />Only names like Jubel Harshaw and David  Bowman (who came to life from the pens of Robert Heinlein and Arthur C.  Clarke) rank with these characters created by Isaac Asimov.  I'm not  positive if this is the best SF/F novel ever written, but it definitely  makes the top five list of best SF novels ever written.<br />It is a great  loss to the world that Asimov slipped off his mortal coil back in 1992.

So, why would he have written a whole book about the Bible?  Especially when you factor in that Asimov was an avowed atheist. The short answer has to do with two things, 1. He wrote about whatever caught his interest, and 2. the  Bible is read by a lot of people who think that it gives them then answers  to all questions, including questions having to do with science.   <br />Basically, Asimov was trying to show that the bible was written with  certain ideas in mind.  It does not answer all the questions of the world,  like some right wing ideologs like to think it does. <br />His commentary on  the bible also goes to show what a lot of things really meant.  Like  Shakespeare, the bible can be a little difficult to grasp in the beginning.   Certain words have different meanings than they do in general use.  Place  names are sometimes different today, then when the various books of the  bible were written.  Asimov goes a long to explaining a lot of those  things.	2000-01-09

History history of the world also had a Penguin edition to  it.<br />It is good that Roberts has multipule publishers for both of these  works, as they are works that should remain in print for a very long time.   I always hate it when I find good stuff that is out of print. <br />Now, about  &quot;A History of Europe&quot;.  Good work. It focuses more on history  after 1800 though.  But then, this is what is important to most modern  readers.  We read to find out some answer to the question of who we are.   So, naturally, a general history is going to focus more on later periods  that tell us more about who are currently are.  <br />It does cover all the  topics of interest.  Prehistoric Europe, thru the Classical period of  Greece and Rome, up thru the middle ages and into modern times.  <br />Great  book to own and read and reread all the time.	2000-01-07

Daneel Olivaw, Book 1)	Books	5	5	6	N	N	The best Robot Novel	This is the best of Isaac Asimov's series of robot novels.  <br />The reason that Asimov claimed that he tried to write science fiction mysteries, in the beginning, was that John W. Campbell Jr, the then editor of Astounding  Science Fiction, had claimed once that SF and Mysteries couldn't really be  mixed as genre.  His reasoning being that the author could be very unfair  to the reader and pull a delux ax machina out of the hat.  Asimov basically  thought an author could do that in just about any mystrry and wrote an SF  Mystery to prove it could be done.<br />Elijah Baley is Sherlock Holmes and R.  Daneel Olivaw is Dr. Watson.  That is not just an accident really, Asimov  was a great fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories. <br />It  is also a great look at what a future earth could be like with regards to  Population Growth.  An issue that Asimov harped on in several of his  science essay's that appeared in &quot;The Magazine of Science Fiction and  Fantasy&quot; over the years.  <br />Along with _Foundation_, this novel forms  the bedrock of Asimov's Foundation-Galactic Empire-Robot series of novels  and some short stories.

It tells the story of history from a simple prespective of what happened when.  Lots of modern historians have gotten away from that simple approach.  It helps  that Asimov is not a historian in the traditional academic way.

It covers major aspects of their lives, and minor  aspects of their lives.  I wish all history books were like this  one.<br />This book goes very far in showing why FDR was the best President of  the United States to ever hold the office.  Lincoln was present durning the  civil war.  Washington was the first President.  Wilson held office durning  the First World War.  But FDR held office and guided the country through  two of its great crisis's - the great depression and world war two.

He was first, because of all the groups in the Science Fictional community, all recogized RAH as a great writer.  In SF... the fact that he was accepted by  all is something of great importance, because it is only maybe five authors  who are accepted by all groups inside the SF community.  <br />Strange in a  Strange Land is Heinlein's best known work.  It deserves to be as well.   Sure, it seems a little older now,  but that is not because it is not good,  but because of how it affected the rest of the Science Fictional Community.   Just about all novels written after it came out show signs of it's affect  on other authors.  Sex, drugs, religion, politics, etc.  This is the work  that brought them into the SF lexecon in full.  <br />Valintine Michael Smith  is a Christ figure out to save the world from itself.

Makes me almost ashamed to admitt that.  (I feel so unclean.) But those of us who try to combat the forces of Evil in this world, one of which are Creationists like  Gish and Morris... well, it helps to know exactly what they are saying.   Because they like to say things that are technically true in such a way as  to make it seem like it means the total opposite. Also, if my response to  their arguements is only to what they mean, instead of what they say, they  will claim I am not familure with their work- so giving the short answer  that these two and the folks they hang around with at the ICR are guys who  wouldn't know what are a dog and cat are unless they have a book claiming  to be dictated from some god-dude telling them what they are... they jump  all over you for not knowing what they are saying.<br />So, lets start simple.   Gish and Morris ar not sure Dogs and Cats exist because their is no Book  of Cat and Book of Doggy in the bible.  So, they have done a lot of  research and found wolves and lions meantioned and have therefore, proved  to themselves, that at least wolves and lions exist. So, they are only a  little worried about the dogs and cats situation.  But it still troubles  them a bit.<br />They don't understand the whole scientific process.  You do  not start with a 2000 year old book and then only admit evidence into the  scientific debate that agrees with the 2000 year old book.  You look  around, and based on what you already know... try and make a determination  of what is going on.  The facts are what you base you deerminations on.   <br />They like to quote people too... of course, only after asking them  questions like &quot;have you stopped beating you wife?&quot;.  <br />They  just don't get it.  But its worse than that. You see, IT has been explained  to them a lot.  They willfully don't get it.  Which is infinitely  worse.<br />Evolution is not _just_ a theory.  It is an observedfact of life.   But to find things like that out, and how it was determined, are not going  to be found in this book.  <br />Remember, it is still only the THEORY of  Gravity that Newton came up with.  Not many people are going around  claiming their ain't no gravity.  For something in science to be called a  theory, is basically the highest honor science can give an idea.  The word  &quot;law&quot; gets tossed around a little, but all that basically means  is &quot;theory that made it 250 years or more&quot;. <br />So, in closing...  Just because I own this book does not mean you should own it as well.  I  would instead suggest a real science book.  How about Darwin's &quot;On the  Origin of Species&quot;?  Come on, I dare you to read that.	1999-12-24

The whole &quot;love your  neighbor unless he has something you want of his, or you don't like him  because he talks funny/looks funny/whatever... then bash his head in with a  brick&quot; mentality of many who partice this group of religions.   And  then those who say things like &quot;Well, that just wasn't a real  Christain who killed all those people&quot; excuses that you hear.   <br />Well... Christains killed a lot of people for the crime of their not  being Christains.  Just because other groups did basically the same thing  does not wash the blood from the hands of the Christians.  Just shows that  lots of groups have blood on their hands.   Christianity does have some  good folks who represent it well... but they pretty much all fall into the  &quot;Those Killers weren't real Christains&quot; apology that is not an  apology.  <br />I'm not a believer in a god or a religion because I see no  compelling reason to believe. Blind Faith in anything is never good.   <br />Christains would do best to try and reform their religion rather than  keep killing and removing from the religious debate all who disagree with  them.  Of course, they have no real arguments... So, killing those who  disagree with you is pretty much the easy way out. <br />This book is good  because it explains all this in a lot more detail than I can ever hope to  include in this brief review.	1999-12-21

Psychics, ESP, Unicorns, and Other Delusions	Books	5	16	25	N	N	Amazing Book	This book exposes those who make things up and try and pass them off as reality.  It shows that it is easy to fool most of the people a lot more than we like to think.  <br />James Randi is one of the leaders of the  skeptical movement.  He would love to be presented with a verifiable  paranormal event.  But whenever somebody looks for a verifiable paranormal  event, they pretty much always find that there was no paranormal event  taking place.  Just a cleverly disguised normal event that it rigged up to  look like magic.  <br />This is why a real magicain is good to have when  inventigating a claim of a paranormal event.  Lay persons, and even  scientists, can be fooled into believing something just because they are  used to having the truth told to them.  <br />This book is good to read so  that one can learn how to avoid falling into some traps.	1999-12-21

To this day, it still retains some of the glory  and sparkle that he put there.  <br />Before he was a great editor, he was a  great writer.  This book contains his short stories.  <br />It is good that  the NESFA keeps the names of Anthony Boucher, C.M. Kornbluth, Cordwainer  Smith and other writers of the past alive. Their stories should be read and  re-read even today.	1999-12-21

Especially the later four. (As Heinlein's works are still  mainly in print.)<br />Jack Williamson, L. Sprague de Camp, Clifford Simak and  Fritz Leiber, and of course, Robert Heinlein are some of the best writers  of SF ever.  (If Asimov and Clarke were includes in this like, it might  well be the top seven.)<br />Stories like &quot;With Folded Hands&quot; by  Williamson, &quot;Grotto of the Dancing Deer&quot; by Simak, &quot;A Gun  for Dinosaur&quot; by de Camp... are all great stories.  There is not one  &quot;stinker&quot;, as Heinlein would have put it, in this book. <br />Enjoy  the stories here.  They really are not making them like they used to.	1999-12-21

He has written several history books that read almost like novels about various aspects of American history.  <br />This is, I believe, the first book  he wrote that later evolved in that series of books.  It includes detailed  briefs on the major personalities in the War (F.D.R., Hitler, Rommel,  Stalin, 'Viniger' Joe Stillwell, etc.)  The accounts let you know how their  lives were shaped, which leads to how they later shaped World War  Two.<br />Mr. Leckie later did the same things with his othe r historys.  He  is unashemedly American in his outlook, but not afraid to critize either.    The title of this book &quot;Delievered from Evil&quot; should give that  away.  After all, the Nazi's were what we would call 'evil'.  Leckie is not  afraid to call it such either.<br />All in all, a great book to have.	1999-12-19

(Skeptics (with the capital &quot;S&quot;) are those who seriously consider but doubt paranormal phenomenon like UFO's, ESP, and religious faith healers.  They  want to see if there is good evidence for the stuff and never find  it.)<br />He makes the reader think.  He considers the breath and width of  human knowledge to all be worth talking and writing about.  He is never  unforthcoming with his opinions. Naturally, this makes for some  controversal opinions coming out. But he lets you know when he blunders as  well. <br />This collection certainly lives up to a testiment that he has had  a long life writing and making folks think about the world they live  in.<br />His greatest flaw, in my opinion, is his belief in a god.

It is not intended to be a History Text book and does not cover all aspects of American History from  1812 to 1865.  It covers good topics on pretty much a topic by topic basis.  Basically, it appears that Mr. Leckie picked like the top 10 topics he  liked about American History from 1812 to the civil war and wrote about  those. And since it is written for the general reader, it does not have a  lot of footnotes.  That all being said, I still love this book.  Mainly  because it deals with a lot of things that get short shrift inAmerican  History classes in high schools and colleges.  Things like the Indian Wars  with Tecumseh (which most Americans would just think of as William T.  Shermans middle name if American History classes were anything to go by.)  and the war with Mexico and how this lead up to some aspects of the Civil  War.<br />In other words, it is geared for somebody who knows something about  American history but is looking to fill some key gaps that were never met  by the Educational system (which pretty much seemsAmerican history and the  Revolution, Civil War and Two World Wars followed by a Cold War with a  little extra thrown in for color and mood.)<br />Don't come here thinking you  will learn all there is to know.  But then, never go to any book thinking  you will learn everything.	1999-12-19

It really isn't the good Doctor's  writing style.  But then, the Good Doctor had that styleless style that  never gets in the way of the Story.   But, Brin has one of the better  writing styles in modern SF/F.  Which makes this very much worth reading.   It is pretty much required that you have read both Benford's and Bear's  books in the series first.  But then, that is why it is called a  &quot;series&quot;.	1999-12-19

Harriet Beecher Stowe's little novel caused  the Civil War by no less an authority than Abe Lincoln himself.  Heck, Abe  Lincoln might as well have his stuff banned too.
