Schmitz really captivated me.   Captain Pausert starts out as a one-dimensional goody two-shoes, but the three \\"witches,\\" Maleen, Goth, and The Leewit gradually turn him into a real person.    A great story for young and old alike, this would be a good gift for any child old enough to read.  And now it has a great sequel, [[ASIN:1416509267 The Wizard of Karres]], by Eric Flint, Dave Freer, Mercedes Lackey; and another sequel, \\"The Sorceress of Karres\\" is in the works.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2005-04-22

Toward this end, a deliberate, well-financed, and expertly executed communications and deregulatory plan was pursued by the right wing for more than thirty years--in close coordination with Republican Party leaders--to subvert and subsume journalism and reshape the national consciousness through the media, with the intention of skewing American politics sharply to the right.  The plan has succeeded spectacularly.\\"    The above quote from pages 10-11 tells what this book is all about: an in-depth examination and documentation of how what forty years ago were rightly considered the \\"lunatic fringe\\" \\"conservatives\\" have largely siezed control of the print and broadcast media, turning their extreme views into \\"conventional wisdom\\" and all but eliminating progressive views from any public hearing.    The right-wing drive to sieze control of the media began when then-President Nixon called Charles Colson into his office and told Colson to get Edith Efron's book \\"The News Twisters\\" on the best-seller lists.  The book, which had, in Colson's opinion, been destined to obscurity, was turned into a best-seller by the simple expedient of Colson \\"finding the particular stores that the New York Times and others regularly checked to determine which books were selling, I enlisted the assistance of some Nixon supporters in New York.  We literally bought out the stores.\\" (Colson, quoted on page 19).    \\"The News Twisters\\" was a meretricious attempt to establish the proposition that the news media slanted its news coverage to the left, a proposition for which there was and still is scant evidence.  It \\"did not survive scrutiny from nonconservatives.\\"   (page 20).  Ben H. Bagdikian wrote in the Washington Post that the book was \\"dishonest, inaccurate . . . [a] demonstration of how to doctor evidence.\\" (quoted on page 20).  The false charge of a systematic liberal bias in the mainstream news media has never been substantiated, but by repeating that lie forcefully and often, the right wing has succeeded in implanting it in the \\"conventional wisdom.\\"  Once that was accomplished, the right wing pursued a campaign to replace the standard of \\"objectivity,\\" reporting the facts accurately and without bias, with a standard of \\"balance,\\" including the opinions of \\"both sides\\" with little or no regard for the objective truth of the views presented.  This allowed the right wing to invent \\"facts\\" to support their arguments with little danger of being called to account for their lies, half-truths, and distortions.    But the right was not satisfied with getting equal time without being subject to any reality check; they wanted ALL the time, with liberal and progressive viewpoints eliminated from the national forum and replaced by timidly middle-of-the-road views relabeled as \\"liberal,\\" as exemplified by Alan Colmes on the Faux News Channel's \\"Hannity and Colmes.\\"      This is a truly important book, one that should be required reading for every voter.  You owe it to our country to be aware if the information it contains.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2004-09-08

I would recommend reading \\"1632\\" first, then \\"1633\\" and  [[ASIN:1416509089 Ring of Fire (Assiti Shards)]] however, read in any order they would still be thoroly delightful.    One critic complained that Flint was \\"preachy.\\" If you want to avoid that, just skip the \\"Author's Afterword\\" (4 pages of \\"1632\\") and read only thru page 492. On the other hand, you may even want to read the Afterword first, because it gives some background information which may help you appreciate the narratives of the series. If you doubt that some blue-collar workers can rise to the level depicted in this series, consider the historical fact that the most brilliant political strategist of the 20th century, Alex Rose, began his career as a member of the Hatters' Union in New York City.

Upon learning that it was a sequel to &#34;1632,&#34; I bought that to read first.  WOW!  I couldn't put it down!**  I had to add the name of Eric Flint to my list of favorite authors!    This is a very plausible and FUN narrative of what might happen if a small town in today's West Virginia had been somehow plopped into Germany in May 1631.  Most of the Americans and most of the Germans and Swedes turn out to be delightful people, and the action is nonstop.  And as an extra bonus, I learned something about European history.    The sequel, &#34;1633,&#34; written in collaboration with David Weber, turned out to be not quite as good as &#34;1632,&#34; but still rates 5 stars, as does [[ASIN:1416509089 Ring of Fire (Assiti Shards)]] a collection of shorter pieces of the same AH, edited by and including a great novella by Eric Flint.

So the boys leave their home town of Hamburg, Germany, and make their way to Venice, Italy, where they are taken in by Hornet, a Venice street girl about Prosper's age, who lives in an abandoned movie theater with two street boys, Riccio and Mosca.  The five kids are watched over by Scipio, the Thief Lord, who is also about their age, but who doesn't sleep in the theater with them.  None of the children know where the Thief Lord does sleep.       Aunt Esther and uncle Max hire Victor, a private detective, who soon finds the kids, and also discovers the Thief Lord's real identity, but by this time Esther and Max have left town, so he doesn't get to tell them right away.       This is a love story on several levels; not just of the brotherly love between Prosper and Bo, but also the love of Renzo and Morosina; the love of Scipio and Hornet for the other children; the love of Ida Spavento for all children; and some others I won't mention lest I give away too much.       Most of the major characters are complex and interesting enough for an adult reader to enjoy.  If you are a parent of pre-teens, this would be a good story to read to them.    watziznayme@gmail.com	2004-01-06

Not because of (...) or violence, but because it is a lousy book, poorly written with a poorly contrived plot that is an insult to the reader.  The author further insults the reader by talking down to him or her, with frequent interruptions to explain the meaning of words used.  Perhaps the intended audience consists of children with no access to a dictionary; but if so, why not be consistent and define ALL polysyllabic words used?    I was looking for a book to give it to my nephew for Christmas, and he has already read all five of the delightful [[ASIN:0545044251 Harry Potter Box set Books 1-7]] (5 stars each), but I wouldn't offer this junk to any intelligent child.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2003-12-14

Even if you have never read anything about Ben Kincaid before, you can start with this one and enjoy it tremendously, but it is all the more fun if  Ben, Christina, Jones, Loving, and the others are old friends.      William Bernhardt created several likable and interesting series characters in addition to Ben Kincaid, and as the series has progressed, some have ben dropped and some have been added.  In \\"Criminal Intent,\\" Paula, one of the more recently added characters, marries Jones, but, as you might expect, their wedding is marred by murder.  One of the mysteries is the lack of any fingerprints on the presumed murder weapon other than those of Father Beale, who is charged with the murder.  Ben is unshakably (and correctly) certain that Father Beale did not murder anyone, but the D.A. is absolutely determined to convict him.    Ben comes up with an ingenious explanation for the lack of fingerprints, but misses an obvious possibility that I was expecting, because Bernhardt himself didn't think of it until I mentioned it in an e-mail to him.  (I found the address of Bernhardt's web site on page 390 of the paperback edition.)      The observations Father Beale tells Ben about on pp. 384-5 may (one hopes) lead to developments in the next novel, \\"Death Row,\\" that we fans of Ben and Christina have been hoping for for some time.    A very welcome development in the most recent Ben Kincaid novels, especially including this one, is an involvement with social issues.  Bernhardt doesn't preach; he just presents a situation involving controversial ethical choices, and lets that situation speak for itself.  Your conclusion, or mine, may or may not agree with Bernhardt's, but we are almost compelled to reconsider our thoughts and conclusions, and possibly to modify some of them.  I suspect that some of the reviewers who didn't like this book were discomforted by the need to think critically about the situation presented.    But if, like me, you find food for thought an invigorating bonus, you will now find it in the more recent mysteries of William Bernhardt, as well as those of Miriam Grace Monfredo, and some of those of Tony Hillerman and Judith Jance, all of which I highly recommend.    Thank you, William Bernhardt.  I am looking forward to many more of your novels.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2003-09-03

While all three of these semi-comic space operas are enjoyable, Barnes really hits his stride with the third novel.  But the first two, albeit not Barnes' best, are very enjoyable, and I would recommend reading them in order.       No, I won't summarize the story here; other reviewers have already done that at least as well as I could, probably better, so why be redundant?    watziznaym@gmail.com	2003-08-13

One map has a legend (I think), but the print is so tiny it is unreadable, even under a magnifying glass. (I am referring here to the paperback).  Even the names attached to the stellar systems are all but unreadable.  There is definitely nothing on either map which is labeled as the \\"Anderson Chain,\\" which is much referred to in the text.  While it is possible to figure out approximately which points on one map are the Anderson Chain, there is still an uncomfortable vagueness.    The reader is often left to wonder how someone got from one specified place to another; the path is often anything but clear.    If the maps were readable and in agreement with the text, I could probably have justified giving it 5 stars; it would be very close to 4 1/2.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2003-08-13

This is the best so far of the Jak Jinnaka books, another rip-roaring good (albeit semi-comic) space opera.  Here, however, Barnes gives an extra bonus: a quite decent helping of food for thought.    Thruout this series, Barnes has occasional tongue-in-cheek touches reminiscent of Joanne K. Rowling's [[ASIN:0545044251 Harry Potter Books 1-7]], such as the title of this one (and, to a lesser extent, the title of the first one).    I will be looking forward to the story of Jak's trip to Triton, and, I hope, another book with the story of Pikia's adventures while Jak is gone.

The series is clearly written for a relatively mature teenage and young adult audience, but it has enough meat to satisfy a more demanding adult reader as well.  Some readers seem to think the light sprinkling of coined words could mystify some readers, but the most-used ones are rather obviously related to existing words, not all English.  By the context, the reader will soon \\"dak\\" (perceive) that \\"toktru\\" means something like \\"talk true\\" or \\"I tell you truly\\" or \\"You tell us truly.\\" \\"Tove\\" (friend) is presumably derived from the Russian \\"tovarich,\\" and   \\"heet\\" from the Japanese \\"hito\\" (person).  There are a few more, but again, the meanings soon become clear from the contexts.    This series is not John Barnes' best work, but this book was interesting and enjoyable enough to entice me to read [[ASIN:0446610828 A Princess of the Aerie]] which I would give about 4 1/3 stars and [[ASIN:0446610836 In the Hall of the Martian King]] which I would rate at about 4 7/8 stars.

Johnson appears to be somewhere near mainstream Christian and Witherington Fundamentalist (neither is identified by denomination). Dr. Miller is Roman Catholic.    Fellowship in the Jesus Seminar is open to anyone with an accredited earned doctorate in Religion, Theology, etc. The Seminar has published numerous books, including \\"The Five Gospels,\\" in which the words attributed to Jesus are printed in (in decreasing order of perceived authenticity) red, pink, grey, or black. Red means the consensus of fellows of the Seminar is that these words are authentically a close English equivalent of what Jesus actually said (in Aramaic or possibly Greek) Black means the consensus of the fellows is that these are not authentic words of Jesus, OR that they are something that most any Jew of Jesus time probably said on occasion; that is, not distinctively of Jesus. Pink and grey are lesser degrees of certainty than red, but more than black.    One common criticism of the four-color schema is that any particular saying either WAS or WASN'T said by Jesus, there can be no in-between. This is, of course, true, but there ARE varying degrees of certainty as to whether particular sayings are authentic. Pink does NOT mean that the saying is, say, 66% authentic (that is an absurdity) but that the fellows, looking at the available evidence from nearly 2000 years ago, averaged to be about 66% convinced that Jesus actually said it (or 34% convinced that the didn't).    One small change that I think would be beneficial would be to show some distinction between those words which are in black because Jesus very likely did not say them, and those which are black because most Jews of jesus' time said them on occasion.  I suppose the distinction is so obvious to professional new testament scholars as not torequire a difference in print, but it would be helpful to us lay persons.  They could use italics for the words not distinctively of Jesus, but which he probably did say.  Also, it might blunt some criticism.     In any book that criticizes another, or responds to criticism, one may wonder whether the objects of criticism or the arguments of the critic(s) are presented fairly. To be certain, one must read the work(s) in question, in this case [[ASIN:0060641665 The Real Jesus : The Misguided Quest for the Historical Jesus and the Truth of the Traditional Gospels]] by Luke Timothy Johnson and [[ASIN:0830815449 The Jesus Quest: The Third Search for the Jew of Nazareth]] by Ben Witherington.    However, I trust Miller's integrity enough to believe that he has presented the criticisms of Johnson and Witherington honestly, not in a watered-down, easy-to-refute version.    I recommend this book highly. It is not only interesting and informative, but lucid and well-written.      watziznaym@gmail.com	2003-07-23

Professor Smith focuses on what Jesus' enemies were saying about him.  Not that Smith agrees with Jesus' enemies; he doesn't, but knowing what they were saying at the time the gospels were being written helps us understand much that appears in the gospels.  The gospel writers said some things in defense of Jesus that we today are likely to find puzzling, if we don't know about the criticism that prompted the defense.  For example, the genealogies offered by Matthew and Luke were likely in part to be intended to refute the accusation that Jesus was fathered by Pantera, a Roman soldier.    The book gets its title, Jesus the Magician, from a charge that was frequently (falsely) levelled at Jesus, namely that he was a magician, not a Divine Healer.  Magicians were believed to get their power from demons, especially Beelzebul, supposedly the ruler of the demons, and Jesus was so accused.  That is why a defense against that accusation appears in the gospels.    Others believed that Jesus was possessed by the spirit of John the Baptizer, another charge against which the gospel writers try to set the record straight.    Smith's work is a bit dated (copyright 1978; he didn't, for example, have a copy of [[ASIN:006063040X The Five Gospels: What Did Jesus Really Say? The Search for the AUTHENTIC Words of Jesus]] to refer to) and it obviously was not edited and revised by Isaac Asimov.  But if you have the perseverence to read thru it, you will greatly enhance your understanding of the melieu in which the gospels were written.    For further knowledge and understanding of the roots of Christianity, read [[ASIN:0380010313 Asimov's Guide to the Bible: The New Testament]] by Isaac Asimov, [[ASIN:0060675578 Liberating the Gospels: Reading the Bible with Jewish Eyes]] by John Shelby Spong, [[ASIN:006063040X The Five Gospels: What Did Jesus Really Say?

Many individuals and situations turn out not to be what at first they seem, but in the end, Miles unscrambles the complex web of deceit and treachery, engineers the capture of the bad guy, returns what was stolen, helps save the career of one who turns out not to be as bad as he at first appears, prevents a war, and restores cordial relations between Barrayar and Quaddiespace; and still gets home to Barrayar in time for the birth of his and Ekaterin's first two children.

In this book, Spong summarizes the reasons why he believes that traditional Christianity is dying (which he has explicated more fully in his excellent book [[ASIN:0060675365 Why Christianity Must Change or Die: A Bishop Speaks to Believers In Exile]]) and tells us his vision of a future Christianity; not only which elements of traditional Christianity will not survive, but which will survive and what will be modified or added to create a new, believable system of thought which remains centered on Jesus, who he views as his doorway to the experience of God.    One desirable modification Spong forsees is the recognition that the Christian doorway thru Jesus is only one of many, and that the doorways of Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and others are in no way inferior to the way of Christianity thru Jesus.    The future Church the (retired) Episcopal bishop describes sounds remarkably similar to the Unitarian-Universalist Association, which has no creed, encourages independent thinking (affirms the right and duty of every person to learn what is known and make up her or his mind about theological questions) welcomes gays and lesbians, and has more women ministers than men (by a slight margin).    I am not convinced of Bishop Spong's theology, but can find no reasonable argument that he is wrong.  Clearly, the earth will be a far better habitat for humanity if the Christian churches reform themselves as Spong envisions.  But if that does happen, would not the spiritual descendants of the \\"love Jesus and send me money\\" crowd find a way to pervert Spong's beautiful vision into a new instrument of domination and idolatry, just as they have perverted the beautiful teachings of Jesus?  That is a question Spong doesn't answer here, but let us hope he will in a future book (or a future edition of this one).    [...]	2003-05-27

Alterman explains and documents the forces which prevent any significant degree of progressivism from appearing in the overwhelming majority of newspapers, magazines, and radio and television broadcasts. He finds only two liberal radio talk show hosts, both on one small station in California late at night and thru the wee hours of the morning. I remember three liberal talk show hosts in New York City, Fred Gale, Alex Bennett, and the gretest talk show host of all, Malachy McCourt, all of whom were forced off the air by a steady barrage of conservative complaints and threats to boycott advertisers. (Read more in Malachy's book [[ASIN:0060195932 Singing My Him Song]])    Many conservative reviewers fault Alterman for using anecdotal evidence; they (perhaps intentionally) miss the point. Yes, he provides a leaven of anecdotal evidence, which he uses to illustrate points he has made and to make for easier reading; nothing but facts and analysis thereof can be terminally boring, and Alterman does not bore, nor should he!    I have just one small carp: the footnotes are all in a separate section at the end of the book, instead of at the bottom of each page where they belong. This imposes on the reader the infernal nuisance of keeping two places and continually flipping back and forth.    This book should be required reading, not only for all prospective journalists but for all citizens who need to know what is going on in the world so that they can vote intelligently.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2003-05-12

So he gravitated toward the victims of those misguided hecklers, the conservatives.  See also Nat Hentoff's excellent book [[ASIN:0060995106 Free Speech for Me--But Not for Thee: How the American Left and Right Relentlessly Censor Each Other]].    What Mr. Brock failed to realize was that those students were not liberals, but authoritarian progressives.  No true liberal would behave as they did.    The misunderstanding arises because we tend to mentally collapse at least three dimensions of political and philosophical  difference into a single spectrum, calling those on the left \\"liberal\\" and those on the right \\"conservative\\"  But the true oppositions are:  Progressive vs. Conservative  Liberal vs. Dogmatic  Libertarian vs. Authoritarian  Now progressives are often liberal and libertarian, and conservatives are often dogmatic and authoritarian, but these common tendencies are only that.  Some conservatives are liberal and/or libertarian, and some progressives are dogmatic and/or authoritarian.    Mr. Brock's disgust with the rude and despicable behavior of those authoritarian progressive students (who probably called themselves \\"liberal,\\" and thus by their misdeeds gave liberalism a bad name) led him to forsake liberalism in favor of the political philosophy of the victims of those misguided students.    Unfortunately, the conservative movement turned out to be even more infested with authoritarian misbehavior.  He found himself living a lie just as much as if he had joined forces with those who silenced Jeane Kirkpatric.    This book is about his dawning realization that what he was doing was at least as bad as what those students had been doing that had so disgusted him, and his decision to follow his reasserted conscience. This book is his confession and his apology.  Like some other reviewers, I believe that he should apologize in person to Anita Hill, and I hope and trust that he has by now done so, or if not, that he will find the courage to do so.  But I prefer to commend him on seeing the light, and on the excellent and valuable book he has written.    Every voter and every future voter should read \\"Blinded by the Right.\\"  It is well enough written to be easy reading, yet interesting and informative enough to be very worthwhile.  Thank you, David Brock.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2003-05-08

As a result, she is drawn into an epic battle between good and evil, in which many participants turn out not to be what at first they seem.  Lyra meets Will, a boy from another Earth, and together and separately they have a slew of marvelous adventures involving witches, armored polar bears, and alien species as well as many varieties of humans, both good and evil.    Pullman uses all four of the basic plots (rags to riches, boy meets girl, the little tailor, and the yellow brick road) with innumerable twists and surprises.  The young heroine and hero make the story appealing to younger teenage readers, but the story is good enough to appeal to even old geezers like me.    Buy them! Read them! Enjoy them!

The America portrayed in the Earthseed novels is indeed horrible, but it is eminently believable as a possible result of the corruption and incompetence of the faux President and his evil cronies.  Could Octavia Butler be a prophet as well as a brilliant writer?    Some have complained about the dark future envisioned in \\"Earthseed.\\"  But while it is entirely appropriate to be horrified and angered by the cruelty, oppression, and injustice of the future Butler presents, we should be inspired by Lauren's continuing hope and perseverence and determination and the eventual triumph of Earthseed.  We should be doing everything we can to insure that the bleak future described in the \\"Earthseed\\" novels will NOT actually happen, because that future, frightening as it is to contemplate, is all too possible.    I read \\"Parable of the Talents\\" before I was able to get my hands on \\"Parable of the Sower.\\"  Both novels are so outstandingly excellent that little was lost by reading them in the wrong order, but it would be better to read \\"Parable of the Sower\\" first.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2002-05-24

It is the coming of age of Lauren Oya Olamina in an all-too-believable near future dystopia in suburban Los Angeles, when hordes of homeless people roam the streets.  Lauren is the daughter of a preacher, who lives in the walled, gated community of Robledo.  Eventually her father disappears on his way home from work; there is little doubt that he has been robbed and murdered, but his widow can't collect his life insurance without a body to prove he is dead.  Soon thereafter, the homeless hordes breach the gates of Robledo and rob and kill nearly all the residents thereof, but Lauren escapes alive, walks to somewhere in northern California, and as she walks, she gathers around her a handful of converts to Earthseed, her new religion, the two major tenets of which are that God is Change and that human destiny is to seed the planets of other stars with human communities.  She meets and converts Bankole, who is also on his way north to visit relatives living on land he owns.  Lauren and Bankole become lovers, and when they arrive at Bankole's land, they find his relatives murdered, and they become the founders of Acorn, the first Earthseed community.    This brief synopsis may sound unbelievable, but with the details Butler weaves into the story, it becomes quite believable.  Also, the coup of 2000, in which the Presidency was seized by the loser of the election with the criminal connivance of five members of the Supreme Court, and the total corruption of the faux President and his administration, make Butler's dystopic future seem all the more a realistic possibility.    The story invites comparison with Edgar Pangborn's wonderful novel, [[ASIN:034530702X DAVY]], also one of the best I have ever read.  A comparison of the two might be an excellent topic for a literature class assignment.    Together with its sequel, [[ASIN:0446610380 Parable of the Talents]], this is one of the most gripping stories you will ever read, and very thought-provoking as well.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2002-05-17

So it's an OUTSTANDING historical novel that grabs the reader and won't let go.  I could hardly put it down.  I am very much a science-fiction fan, but I am not so foolish as to think a novel has to be science-fiction to be good.  I have read many excellent historical novels, some of the best of which were those of Kenneth Roberts, Kyle Onstott, Lance Horner, Miriam Grace Monfredo, and Diana Gabaldon, all of which I highly recommend, but \\"Kindred\\" stands out above all of them for sheer impact.    Some readers have downgraded \\"Kindred\\" for not including a pseudo-scientific \\"explanation\\" of time travel (to make the book qualify as science-fiction) or for not explicitly criticizing Dana's and/or Rufus' ethical imperfections.  Fortunately, Octavia Butler had the sense to know that either an unneeded \\"explanation\\" or a preachy chapter of ethical criticism would have greatly weakened the impact of the story.    I look forward to reading more of Octavia Butler's books.  Thank you, Pam Hanna, for recommending her works.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2002-01-25

Moses, a leader of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960's, has (correctly) reached the conclusion that Math literacy is, in these times and for the predictable future, a prerequisite for first-class citizenship, and since he still wants everyone to be a first-class citizen (and rightly so) he has embarked on a campaign to enable every child to be mathematically literate, and he has enjoyed a considerable degree of success.  There is still a long way to go; his program (or more accurately, the program developed by Moses and his associates and the children, parents, and teachers they have worked with) has so far been adopted only by a small minority of the schools, but in those schools where it is in place, math achievement has increased significantly, and (SURPRISE!) reading scores have also improved significantly.<br /><br />THIS IS A RESULT THAT EVERY TEACHER AND EVERY SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR SHOULD KNOW ABOUT!  THIS BOOK SHOULD BE IN EVERY SCHOOL LIBRARY!<br /><br />I have only one small carp with this book.  On page 7 is the statement: &#34;The result was the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC), the world's first programmable computer.  I asked three Afro-American students, ages 15-21, what was the world's first programmable computer, and not one of them mentioned ENIAC.  Rather, they all replied that the first programmable computer was the Zuse Z3.  They were all correct. The Z3, designed and built by Konrad Zuse in Germany, and operational in 1939, approximately 2 years before ENIAC, was the world's first programmable computer.  Fortunately, the German High Command didn't take Zuse and his computer seriously.<br /><br />However, the error is understandable.  Most textbooks on the subject in America incorrectly credit ENIAC with being first (I would expect that few if any German texts fail to give credit where it belongs.)  Moses was probably innocently repeating what he had been taught at Harvard.  And in any case, this one minor erroris but a very minor blemish on a very relevant and valuable book.  If you are a parent of school-age children, you should get this book, and then get together with other parents and with your children to demand that your school adopt the Algebra Project curriculum.  Your children deserve the best education possible, and that means using the Algebra Project curriculum.  Also, buy and read [[ASIN:0553379747 Victory in Our Schools: We Can Give Our Children Excellent Public Education]], by John Stanford.  The two books complement each other.	2002-01-13
US	49784324	RYESIISCDCPEV	0944344763	790811420	The World to Come	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Not To Be Dismissed Lightly	Are we living in the end-times?  No and maybe, says Geering; the fiery end of the world (when the sun expands into a red giant star) is not imminent, but the times we live in may indeed be end-times of another sort. He foresees the end of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism as we now know them, all in the fairly near future.  And not in a sudden, cataclysmic event, but in the gradual rise to supremacy of a new, global religion containing, he hopes, the best elements of all of the above-mentioned faith traditions.    The new (small u) universalism (Geering does not use that word, perhaps because it could too easily be confused with Universalism, a denomination) would be non-exclusive (no us vs. them; accepting of all ethnic groups and a wide variety of personal beliefs as to the details, but united in its reverence for the earth and for all living things).  He gives a new, global meaning to Benjamin Franklin's famous assertion that \\"We must all hang together, or most assuredly we will all hang separately.\\"    The human race can no longer afford to be, as Geering puts it, \\"Humanity at War with Itself [and] . . . at War with the World.\\"     While I cannot agree with all of Geering's opinions, I found his book very interesting and thought-provoking, and well worth buying and reading.  One reviewer took issue with the fact that Geering writes from the perspective of a predominately Christian background.  Granted, the book might have been even better if Geering were equally at home in all of the faith traditions of the world, but let us be thankful that he didn't wait until he was able to produce a PERFECT work before sharing his insights with the world.  Thank you, Mr. Geering.  Your wisdom is a valuable contribution to the welfare of the human community, which is more than can be said, I suspect, for most of your detractors.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2001-10-27

Now I learn on page 13 that the CIA owns \\"everyone of any significance in the major media.\\"<br /><br />I learn that the country I have been and want to be proud of is a rogue state that has one of the world's worst records on human rights.  I learn about the many, many steps our executive, legislative, and judicial branches have taken to chip away at our civil rights and our civil liberties.  I learn that my country is well on the way to becoming a police state.<br /><br />I don't want to believe all the terrible things McGowan tells about my country, but he has carefully documented what he says, so that denial is not rationally possible.  I wish this book were a compendium of vicious lies, but unfortunately it is a compendium of appalling truths.  Ignorance of these awful facts may be bliss to some, but I, for one, don't care for the idea of living in a fool's paradise.<br /><br />Every patriotic American should read this book.  Maybe, just maybe, someone smarter than I will figure out a way to get this country back on the right track.  Yes, it is \\"my country, right or wrong,\\" but I happen to know the rest of that quote: \\"when right to keep it right, when wrong to make it right.\\"<br /><br />If you, too, are a patriotic American, reading this book will make you feel very angry and frustrated at some of the things our country has done and is still doing.  But if you (singular and plural) can channel that anger into a search for a way to set our country right, and if some one or more of us succeed -- then it will be more than worth the pain we suffer.<br /><br />watziznaym@gmail.com	2001-10-26

If only this book had been proofread before printing, it would deserve the top rating. (I know there is no 10-star rating available here, but it could be established.)    Anyone who doubts that the current President-appointee is a disgrace to the Oval Office should read this detailed account of his shameful performance as governor of Texas.    As governor, Dubya consistently did everything he could to protect the interests of companies which polluted the air and water of Texas; he demonstrated that he cared nothing for the rights of the poor or the middle classes.  He championed legislation to protect wealthy polluters from being required to pay for cleaning up their messes, leaving toxic wastes to be cleaned up at taxpayers' expense or left to poison those living in the neighborhood where the waste was dumped.    Shrub even fought to have toxic and radioactive wastes from other states brought to Texas, and dumped near the Mexican border, where people of little political clout (Hispanics and Afro-Americans, mostly, and certainly none of the wealthy) are living.     He even had the gall to deny Texans their constitutional right to protest peacefully on the public sidewalk against his outrageous misconduct as governor.  Texans who were violating no law, but who were publicly protesting Shrub's wrongdoing, were arrested, strip-searched, and held overnight in jail.    Little wonder that Shrub has pretty well established himself as the worst President in our nation's history.  And most likely, the worst is yet to come.  If only the facts cited in this book had been widely publicized before and during the election campaign, we might now have a decent President who would not be so eager to lead us into an unwinnable war for the benefit of \\"defense\\" contractors that contributed generously to his campaign.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2001-09-29

Bush	Books	4	46	49	N	Y	Details of Shrub's Sorry Performance as Governor of Texas	Shrub wasn't the first corrupt governor of Texas, and he probably won't be the last, but he may well have been the most successful in selling out the interests of the people of Texas to build up his campaign chest. This book details how Shrub rewarded the polluters who gave him money with immunity ledgal responsibility for the pollution they created, leaving the taxpayers of Texas to pay for the cleaning up that Shrub's contributors should have been required to do. It also cites the many lies Shrub told to gain support for his nefarious schemes.    The last chapter recounts how, under Shrub, the traditional right of Texans to hold protests on the sidewalk in front of the Governor's mansion was unlawfully denied. The Governor's \\"protective Detail\\" of State Police adopted a policy of arresting and strip searching anyone who used that particular stretch of public sidewalk to protest peacefully against anything Bush had done. Persons so arrested were held in jail for 24 hours, then released (because they had done nothing illegal, no charges could be brought against them, but the experience surely has a chilling effect on those who protested, and on others who might contemplate protesting).    The author, Rick Abraham, has been director of the non-partisan Texans United Education Fund, and before that the Hazardous Waste Project Director for the Texas Center for Policy Studies. He has been arrested twice for participating in protests in front of the Governor's Mansion. Thus he knows whereof he writes.

Part 1, \\"Sounds\\" (chapters 1-7) covers phonology; part 2, \\"Words\\" (chapters 8-16) deals with morphology; and part 3, \\"Sentences\\" (chapters 17-26) is about syntax.    Part 1 is particularly difficult for the typical American reader because most of the English language examples are based on Received Standard pronunciation (or something near enough to RS to be less than illuminating for one brought up to speak a dialect close to Network Standard).    But worse by far than that is the authors' lack of understanding of how the English language works.  For example, on page 227 is the following sentence:  \\"Additionally, . . . \\"I dog Bill\\" and \\"Bill dogs me\\" are interpreted quite differently, and these different interpretations are due to the choice between nominative \\"I\\" and accusative \\"me\\" and the related choice between \\"dog\\" and \\"dogs.\\"  (because this text box does not permit me to italicize or underline, I have put quotation marks around words that are italicized in the book.)    Once upon a time, several centuries ago, case inflections of pronouns had some grammatical significance in English, but English has since evolved into a positional language.  In modern English, direction of action is determined solely by position, and the remaining vestiges of nominative and accusative case inflections have no grammatical significance whatever.  The only case inflections that retain any grammatical significance are the possessives, and in some dialects of English even those are disappearing.    The third and final part of the book discusses syntax, and features an altogether ludicrous reclassification of the components of sentences.  If the authors were to describe a house like they describe the structure of English, the living room might be viewed as subsidiary in importance to the coat closet, and the kitchen and dining room as minor adjuncts to the pantry.  Auxiliary verbs are accorded more importance than content verbs.  Here we find no Noun Phrases; they are called Determiner Phrases if they contain no case marker, otherwise Prepositional Phrases.    For an introduction to the fascinating subject of linguistics, as Consumer Reports might put it, there are better choices.    Above is my review exactly as originally submitted.  \\"A customer\\" strongly recommends that my criticisms be ignored, or perhaps counted as plusses.  I leave it to you, the reader, to decide whether the false statement on page 227 is a 'plus' for the book, and whether the words in caps in the following sentence are the most important words in the sentence:    THE constitution OF THE united states is THE supreme law OF THE land.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2001-04-27

It is now 1854, six years after \\"Inheritance,\\" and the abolitionist debate is going strong. The Republican Party has just been founded in Ripon, Wisconsin.    Glynis strongly believes in obeying the law of the land, but she is unable to obey the Fugitive Slave Act by turning in Kiri, a lovely young girl who has escaped from a plantation in Virginia, and who is the beloved of Glynis' landlady's son, Niles.  Glynis helps get Kiri to the home of Frederick Douglass, where she is hidden awaiting the opportunity to escape to Canada, where Niles plans to join her.  When Niles is captured and taken to Virginia for trial, Glynis and Jeremiah Merrycoyf go to Virginia to try to save him.  There ensues a fine courtroom drama, with Glynis turning up a key piece of evidence.  Glynis and Merrycoyf return to Seneca Falls, and the villian, Thomas Farley, is unmasked.    This is but a small sample of the plot twists of this delightful book.  It is a great read, and you will learn a bit of American history in the bargain.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2001-04-16

Anthony, and others.  The convention took place in Seneca Falls.    The main characters of the story are fictional, but many of the minor characters are real people of the time.  The historical background is well-researched and mostly accurate. (I can't point to any historical inaccuracy, but even the best historical scholarship is unlikely to produce perfect knowledge of every detail.)    Whether you are just looking for great light reading or for a story that enhances your knowledge of the early history of the women's movement, you'll find it here, and you'll also enjoy the sequels, [[ASIN:0425147207 North Star Conspiracy]], [[ASIN:0425152669 Blackwater Spirits]], [[ASIN:B000PSQ8VM The Stalking Horse]], [[ASIN:042517610X Must the Maiden Die]]\\" and others.    NOTE TO HIGH SCHOOL HISTORY TEACHERS:  These novels, and the novels of Kenneth Roberts ([[ASIN:0892723866 Rabble in Arms]], [[ASIN:0892723645 Arundel]] and several others) provide an excellent means of bringing American history alive for your students, and getting them interested in the subject.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2001-03-30

Ben takes the case after nearly every other lawyer in town has refused to touch it.  Ben is up against his former law firm, the biggest and richest in town, and they will stop at nothing to defeat him.  They manage to keep Ben from finding out about the one piece of evidence that would really make his case. The judge is a great admirer of the leading attorney for the defense, and he blatantly favors them.  Meanwhile, Ben's landlady is dying and knows it, and she begs to see her estranged son.  Jones locates him in New York, but the son flatly refuses to have anything to do with his mother, even on her deathbed.    John Grisham's excellent [[ASIN:0385342926 The Appeal]] (also 5 stars) describes a similar situation with a different ending.  Both books are real page-turners.    There is also a series of grisly murders connected with the case, but the connection is not apparent.  Also, Christina graduates from law school.    Not only is the plot complex and full of action and surprises, but the main characters, Ben and Christina, are interesting and sympathetic characters, people you would like to have as neighbors and friends.  Every book in the series leaves one eager for the next episode in their lives.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2001-03-23

In fact, Rob S. Pierre and Oscar St. Just never do live it down.  White Haven clobbers the peeps with his new, improved toys, but Oscar's final bit of mischief robs him of his final victory.  Oscar tried to have Queen Elizabeth III and Benjamin Mayhew assassinated, but Honor interferes, stopping one of the missles, but she can't stop the other one from destroying the ship the Queen was supposed to be in, but wasn't.  But Cromarty was in that ship, and this results in a lot of trouble. Too many loose ends are tied up; is this the final episode?  I earnestly hope not, because this series is just too much fun to have it end here.  But there is hope; there are still a few loose ends.  What will the new government of Haven be like?  And What will be the undoing of the new, bad government of Manticore?    This is the longest Honor Harrington novel yet, and there is much more in it than I have mentioned above.  Get it and read it; you'll be glad you did.  This is a series I would enjoy reading again, if I can ever get caught up on the other books waiting to be read.  Every book in the series is great fun.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2001-03-11

Like Tony Hillerman's books, without being at all preachy, this book and [[ASIN:0380711079 Hour of the Hunter]], of which it is a sequel, give us a glimpse of a Native American culture that will be a great loss to all of us if it is not preserved.  It would be wonderful if Judith Jance and Tony Hillerman could get together to give us one or more pairs of novels in which Diana Ladd and/or Joanna Brady work with Jim Chee and/or Joe Leaphorn.    \\"Kiss of the Bees\\" cries out for a sequel (or better, a pair of sequels) in which Lani finds a good, gentle, loving husband, and Davy and Candice adjust to each other and create a successful marriage, meanwhile helping Diana and Brandon Walker, Joanna Brady, Jim Chee, and Joe Leaphorn solve some cases.    I was glad I had already read \\"Hour of the Hunter\\" before starting this book.  I recommend you do the same.  Also, read some of Tony Hillerman's novels of Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee, and Judith  Jance's Joanna Brady series (start with [[ASIN:0727861158 Desert Heat (Joanna Brady Mysteries, Book 1)]]) and see if you don't agree that it would be great to get all of these wonderful people together for an adventure.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2001-01-24

It begins approximately where \\"A Monk Swimming\\" leaves off.  Malachy meets his second-wife-to-be, Diana, and her lovely but retarded daughter, and, now in his mid-thirties, he begins the slow process of growing up.  It is much more difficult to grow up after one's mid-thirties, because the additional fifteen to twenty years of childhood in an adult body has created many more bad habits, more firmly established.    As in \\"A Monk Swimming,\\" Malachy tells it like it was, omitting little or none of the things he is less than proud of.  Sometimes sad, sometimes very funny, this is the story of a man overcoming the lessons of his dysfunctional birth-family and finally co-creating a functional, loving blended family.  It is a joy and an inspiration.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2001-01-02

Actually, there is some slight overlap, because Frank's arrival back in United States is mentioned in both books; at the end of the first and at the beginning of the second.  \\" 'Tis\\" recounts Frank's college days at New York University and his career as an English teacher in the public schools of New York City, and, of course, much more.    Like its predecessor, this book is a delight to read.  Having read either, you will want to read the other and Malachy McCourt's [[ASIN:0006531156 A Monk Swimming]] and [[ASIN:B000C4SKK6 Singing My Him Song]].

When I found out that Frank McCourt was Malachy's older brother, I bought \\"Angela's Ashes,\\" and read it as soon as I finished Malachy's memoir, [[ASIN:B0007RDOSG A Monk Swimming : A Memoir]].    I was glad I did.  It turned out that Frank is an even better writer than Malachy, and that the two books complement each other very nicely.  Both books make fascinating reading, as does Frank's second book, [[ASIN:B000CC49IK Tis: A Memoir]]    Frank and Malachy McCourt were born in United States, but brought up in County Limerick, Ireland, in abject, grinding poverty that caused the death of their sister and two younger brothers.  If you can read \\"Angela's Ashes\\" without tears coming to your eyes, then you are thicker-skinned than I.    It is an inspiration and a tribute to Frank and Malachy that both eventually overcame their dysfunctional early lives.  Unfortunately, it took Malachy much longer than it did Frank.    The horrors recounted in \\"Angela's Ashes\\" are reminiscent of the very different horrors experienced by Waris Dirie, as told in her excellent autobiography, [[ASIN:1860497586 Desert Flower]], also well worth reading.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2000-12-31
US	49784324	R2DYHN61BDGO0V	0786884142	713265752	A Monk Swimming A Memoir	Books	5	3	5	N	N	Radio's Greatest Talk-Show Host Tells All	In 1967, when WMCA was a top 40 station, I heard on someone else's radio an editorial by station owner Peter Strauss, and, impressed by Strauss's intelligence and decency, became a loyal listener to WMCA.  So after WMCA changed its format to become a talk station, I was fortunate enough to become acquainted with the greatest talk show host in the history of radio, Malachy McCourt.  So of course, when I heard on WPLN that Malachy was going to be at the Davis-Kidd bookstore in Nashville, I made it a point to be there with my copy of \\"A Monk Swimming\\" for him to sign.  And having learned that Frank McCourt was Malachy's brother, I bought and read [[ASIN:B000H2MTUA Angela's Ashes]] too.  Later, I bought and read Frank's second book, [[ASIN:0684865742 'Tis: A Memoir]]    The three books complement each other.  All three are delightful, and I am very much looking forward to reading Malachy's second book, [[ASIN:B000C4SKK6 Singing My Him Song]].    Malachy tells it like it was, including the things he is now ashamed of (and I learned that he has much to be ashamed of), but I prefer to judge him on the intelligent, decent, witty person he has become, rather than the dysfunctional husband and father that he once was.  No, I don't condone the bad things he has done, but I celebrate his eventual triumph over the unfortunate parts of his heritage.    Malachy's varied career as gold smuggler, bar owner, talk show host, actor, etc. did not make him as polished a wordsmith as his english-teacher brother, but \\"A Monk Swimming\\" is a fascinating and delightful complement to his brother's books, as they are to \\"A Monk Swimming.\\"  Read and enjoy them all!    watziznaym@gmail.com	2000-12-31

It begins with a series of anecdotes about how various children were taught racism; for example, one little boy invited his friends to his birthday party, to the evident consternation of his parents, who let him know in no uncertain terms that inviting black friends into his home was NOT acceptable behavior.  He was made to feel that he had done something very wrong.<br /><br />Young children, dependent on their parents for their very survival, are in no position to question the rightness of their parents' teachings, even when they may feel something is wrong.  Survival requires them to conclude that the fault is theirs, and they must accept what they are taught and adjust their feelings accordingly.<br /><br />As I read this book, I recognized my parents' failed attempts to teach me to be white.  They started too late; I had already decided I did not want to be a racist.  I grew up in a town where there were no black families, so it wasn't until I was 16 that I was subjected to an attack from my mother because I had been greatly impressed (and told her parents so) with the intelligence of a girl I had met who, unbeknownst to me, had a slight admixture of &#34;Negro&#34; ancestry.  When the reason behind her attack finally came out, my instant response was to tell my mother that she ought to be ashamed of herself, and that I was ashamed of her for demanding that I act in a dishonorable (i. e. racist) manner, a demand that I would never consider obeying.<br /><br />Read this book.

A young girl whose father had sold her into indentured servitude to the murdered man is the prime (but wrong) suspect in his murder.  Glynis (of course) figures out who really did the murder, and exonerates the maiden.

A chilling picture of United States after a fundamentalist coup:  women have become second-class citizens, who may not own money or property.  They are essentially a slave class.  Every woman is the property of some man.    No religion other than the official Church is allowed to exist.  No one can be required to truly accept the official religion, but everyone is required to appear to accept it without question; anyone suspected of believing otherwise is not likely to remain alive.    Should a fundamentalist group gain political control of this country, some of the details will no doubt differ from what is described in this book, and other details will differ from the present situation in Afghanistan, but there can be little doubt that women will be reduced to second-class citizens with little or no control over their bodies or their lives.    If, as now appears almost certain, a candidate owned by the religious right succeeds in stealing the election and becomes the next President, then it is very likely that we shall at least start down the path toward a dystopia similar to what Atwood portrays so well.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2000-11-27

Bush	Books	5	28	38	N	N	An Unbiased Look at an Empty Suit	Molly Ivins and Lou Dubose chronicle \\"Shrub\\"'s political life.  What emerges is the unsavory picture of an empty suit for sale to the highest bidder.  Shrub's reason for seeking the Presidency is apparently his burning desire to get revenge for his father's loss in 1992.  Never mind that Daddy was the most ineffective President of the twentieth century; that the economy grew at less than half the rate it grew under any other administration since 1948.  (In 1945-1948, the GNP actually shrunk, because of the changeover from an all-out wartime effort to peace.)    Molly Ivins tells it like it is, giving Shrub what credit is due for not dismantling the improvements in the Texas school system made by the governors who preceded him; but also pointing out that he has successfully fought against implementation of clean air and water in Texas.  Under Shrub's \\"leadership\\" Houston has supplanted Los Angeles as the U. S. city with the most polluted air.  The polluters support Shrub and he supports their \\"right\\" to pollute.  Shrub said that the problem isn't pollution, it's impurities in the air and water.    This book, along with J. H. Hatfield's [[ASIN:1887128840 Fortunate Son: George W.

Now it is perfectly true that standardized tests can be misused and misinterpreted, but that is hardly the only way they can be used. In my experience, the New York State Regents examinations have served all three of the following purposes:  1. Provide a statewide minimum standard of academic achievement which means that those students who receive a Regents diploma have a more meaningful credential than a mere school diploma. Prospective employers know what a Regents diploma signifies, whereas they seldom know how much a school diploma means.  2. Protects students against that small minority of teachers who would fail students they don't like. Granted, good teachers far outnumber bad teachers, but this is small consolation to victims of bad teachers. I know whereof I speak. My eighth grade English teacher would have failed me, but for the Regents exam. State law said anyone who passed the Regents passed the course.  3. Alerts state authorities to schools in which students consistently exceed or fall short of the expected level of academic achievement. The high-performing schools can be studied so that other schools can benefit from their methods, and low-performing schools can be helped to improve.  It seems to be this third \\"benefit\\" which has Meier up in arms. If the state authorities use the tests as an excuse to punish schools and teachers for below-average performance instead of aiding them to improve, then they are misusing the information from the tests, and this, beyond question, is bad. And it is true that politicians often prefer to withhold state aid from underperforming schools rather than give them the extra help they need to improve. After all, it \\"saves the taxpayer money\\" to give the schools less instead of more. It may be great political grandstanding, and it may get votesfrom the selfish and foolish, but it is a betrayal of the children the state is supposed to be serving. Meier is quite rightly offended by this.  But Meier ignores the baby in her zeal to throw out the bath water. It is not the tests that are at fault, but the politicians that misinterpret and misuse them.  Meier's essay is followed by seven critiques by seven other authors, all of which, in one way or another, miss the point. They all would do well to read John Stanford's book [[ASIN:0553379747 Victory in Our Schools: We Can Give Our Children Excellent Public Education]], which presents a program that, in addition to tests to evaluate student achievement and teacher performance, provides help to those teachers and students who are underperforming. Stanford correctly, I believe, assumes that nearly all teachers want to do right by their students, and he stood ready to provide those teachers with leadership, encouragement, and assistance in bettering their performance. Nearly all of them did!    watziznaym@gmail.com	2000-11-20

But I can't bring myself to be so dishonest as to bad-mouth the book or its author, who has become one of my personal heros.    Despite being brought up in a racist, sexist, homophobic, fundamentalist environment, John Shelby Spong has risen above all that to become one of the greatest champions of all-inclusive love and fair treatment of everyone.    Who can I compare John Shelby Spong to?  He is a true prophet.  He is a champion of those who are persecuted.  He is a thorn in the side of the comfortable.  Only one name comes to mind to compare to John Shelby Spong, and that name is Jesus.  Many of us aspire to emulate Jesus, but I know of no one who has come closer to doing what Jesus would do in the world today than has Bishop Spong.  Unfortunately, and also like Jesus, Spong has been made to suffer for his good deeds, albeit not to the point of death.  It was a great pleasure, as well as an inspiration, to read the story of his life.    I did find two minor annoyances in the book:  The footnotes are at the end of each chapter, instead of at the bottom of the page where the reference occurs, and it would have been nice to have had a glossary in which the ecclesiastical terms were explained.  But the pleasure of reading this wonderful book was far more than enough to compensate for the little that it lacked.  I eagerly await Spong's next book, whatever it may be.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2000-11-17

The characters are well-drawn and interesting, except for Jordan, the son of Delaney and Kyra Menaker-Mossbacher, who is completely cardboard, and Socorro, daughter of Candido and America, who is only a few weeks old by the end of the book.  One can hardly expect much character delineation of an infant, but Jordan is old enough to be a real person.    Kyra is a champion real estate salesperson, very driven, who loves her work perhaps more than her family.  Delaney is a nature writer who wants to be laid back, but doesn't quite make it.  He would have voted for Ralph Nader, but hesitated to admit to his neighbors that he hadn't voted for George W. Bush.    Candido, in his thirties, and his beloved seventeen-year-old wife America are illegal immigrants from Mexico.    The novel nicely contrasts the affluent lifestyle of Delaney and Kyra with the abject poverty of Candido and America, who seek honest work, and work hard when they can get any work, but are repeatedly cheated and robbed of what very little they have.    After 354 pages that would have rated at least 4 1/2 stars, Boyle apparently ran out of steam, and halfway thru page 355 he just stopped writing.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2000-11-09

It is a tribute to the greatness of [[ASIN:0765342294 Ender's Game]] that another great book could be written about the same major events. [[ASIN:0765342294 Ender's Game]] is such an outstandingly excellent book that it would seem an impossible act to follow, but follow it Card does with a story every bit as fascinating, even tho it lacks the blockbuster surprise ending of [[ASIN:0765342294 Ender's Game]] and you already know the major events of the story.  There are two great surprises at the end of \\"Ender's Shadow,\\" but neither is as mind-blowing as the surprise in [[ASIN:0765342294 Ender's Game]].    [[ASIN:0765342294 Ender's Game]] should be read before [[ASIN:0765342405 Ender's Shadow]], so as not to weaken the impact of the ending of [[ASIN:0765342294 Ender's Game]].    watziznaym@gmail.com	2000-11-06

Unlike them, he has the potential to become a military genius at a time when it is believed (perhaps correctly) that only a military genius can save humanity.  This is the story of those three child prodigies.  It would have been a fascinating story even without the mind-blowing surprise at the end.  But before you read it a second time, read Card's [[ASIN:1857239989 Ender's Shadow (Shadow Saga)]], which takes place in the same universe, the same time period, and mostly in the same places as \\"Ender's Game.\\"  The difference is that Ender, while still a major character, is not the viewpoint character.

Stein's first novel; if so, he has started out with a bang, and I eagerly await his next offering.    The fast-paced action takes place sometime in the near future.  Caleb is an environmentalist of a spiritual bent, who just may be a prophet, but the Gentlemen Of Decision, who are captains of industry, decide that Caleb is a danger to their profits, and they decide to have him assassinated.  Peter is an admirer (disciple?) of Caleb, and Peter's father, Martin, is one of the Gentlemen Of Decision.  I don't want to spoil your enjoyment of this great story by revealing any more of the details.    This novel is supposedly a satire, and it is an excellent one, but one can't help wondering to what extent it may, like William Bernhardt's [[ASIN:0345434765 Dark Justice]], be based on actual incidents.

She became an internationally famous model, learned to speak English, got married, divorced, and remarried, and finally became a spokeswoman for the United Nations against female genital mutilation.    The story of her life is fascinating, but the genital mutilation she and her sisters suffered is disgusting.  Dirie relates that no man of her native culture would want to marry a woman who had not been mutilated in such a way as to make it impossible for her to feel the intense pleasure of sexual intercourse.  Thus mutilated, she supposedly cannot be tempted by other men.  Many young girls die from infections contracted from unsanitary instruments used in this barbarous procedure.    Both men and women there are really missing out on the joy they could have, were men to give women the respect they deserve.  Such a man may experience orgasm, but he can never experience the far greater joy of knowing that he has given the greatest and most intense pleasure to someone he deeply loves and respects.  If I were married to a woman so mutilated, I would feel sorely cheated because I could never give her the pleasure I would want her to have.  Like the Texas oilman who married a much younger wife and was warned that she would soon take on other lovers, I would rather own five percent of a gusher than lock, stock, and barrel of a dry hole.    I hope Dirie's husband will always be loving, thoughtful, and kind to her, because after the hell she has been thru, she deserves all the happiness he can give her, and then some.  Her story is an inspiration, but at the same time it is a challenge to the rest of us to do what we can to end the horrible practise of female genital mutilation.watziznaym@gmail.com	2000-10-25
US	49784324	R15UDJ8AFMYEPF	0060674296	67748143	Resurrection: Myth or Reality?	Books	5	21	33	N	N	Spong Answers: Myth AND Reality	Spong attempts to distinguish between the myths surrounding Jesus' \\"resurrection\\" and the reality of what he calls \\"the Easter Moment,\\"  which the myths \\"point to.\\"  He quite persuasively reconstructs what may well be the actual sequence of events leading up to and following \\"The Easter Moment.\\"    Jesus was probably crucified just before, during, or just after the Jewish festival of Passover.  If the Jews had any input into the decision to put Jesus to death, their consideration of the matter did NOT occur during Passover.  They may have concurred in the decision before Passover, or after Passover, or (most likely) not at all, but it would have been a major scandal for them to consider the question DURING Passover.  They would have been horrified at the thought of desecrating the holy days of Passover by conducting such deliberations then, so it can be confidently asserted that they did not do so.      The \\"Easter Moment,\\" Spong argues, occurred not in Jerusalem, but in the vicinity of Lake Chinnereth (Galilee), quite possibly in a fishing boat on the lake itself.  It occurred sometime during the summer following the Crucifixion, or possibly early in the fall.    Read the book to find out who experienced the Easter Moment, and led the triumphant entry into Jerusalem, and when.    In the final pages, Spong says that he has led the reader to what he believes is the true beginning of Christianity, and that the reader must now decide for herself (himself) whether to answer as Spong has with a resounding \\"yes\\" and accept the reality of the resurrection as he has described it, or to answer \\"no\\" and walk away from it.  This reader could do neither.  While I am convinced that Spong's reconstruction of events is the most plausible account I have found, I cannot feel certain that Spong's interpretation of those events is correct, but neither can I feel certain that it is wrong.  Spong's theology is certainly more plausible than the theology of those who insist that the lectionaries of Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John are factually inerrant biographies of the life of Jesus.  Spong's theology also leads him to \\"love wastefully\\" all of humanity, regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and so on.  But if Spong's \\"Christianity\\" becomes the wave of the future, how can it fail to be distorted and perverted by the commercial purveyors of \\"Christianity\\" (the \\"love Jesus and send me money\\" crowd), just as Jesus' message of all-embracing love was perverted to justify the Inquisition, the Holocaust, and more recently, the systematic raping of Islamic women in Bosnia?    watziznaym@gmail.com	2000-10-23

We do get a great deal more in-depth look at the ecology of Avalon, including various species of grendels and several other genera not encountered before.  Humans have learned to cope with grendels, but now they must learn to cope with the mysterious \\"death wind,\\" and meanwhile at least one grendel is learning to cope with humans.    Reading this book just after reading Lois McMaster Bujold's excellent [[ASIN:0671578855 A Civil Campaign]] led me to compare the more limited character development in \\"Beowulf's Children\\" to the extensive character development in \\"A Civil Campaign.\\"  Altho they may seem so by comparison to the Barrayarans, these are NOT cardboard characters.  The characters in \\"Beowulf's Children\\" are developed to the extent appropriate for a story, the main focus of which is the ecological systems of an alien planet.  Significantly deeper development of the human characters would have diverted attention from the alien ecologies of Avalon and the problems of both humans and grendels in learning to cope with the weirdnesses of each other.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2000-10-18

Stanford tells us how to make public schools really work.  I was at first a bit put out by his advocacy of &#34;running schools like a business,&#34; having all too often heard that phrase as an excuse for placing cost reduction above all other goals. But Stanford clearly recognizes and strongly emphasizes that the correct BOTTOM LINE for a school is STUDENT ACADEMIC ACHIEVMENT! The proper test of a proposed expenditure is its anticipated effect on SAA (Student Academic Achievment) per dollar spent. Projects should be prioritized by decreasing improvement in SAA per dollar.  The most important qualification for a school administrator is not knowledge of teaching, but ability to be an effective LEADER. The successful school administrator must have the LEADERSHIP to get several constituencies enthusiastically involved in achieving a high level of SAA. These constituencies include not only teachers, school staff, and students; but also other government entities, parents, businesses, the media, and the general public.  The leader should practice management by support rather than management by intimidation. The intimidated will concentrate on keeping a low profile and covering their backsides. The leader can benefit little from such people, because no leader can provide all the needed creativity. (S)he must encourage and reward constructive suggestions from teachers, staff, students, parents, businesses, other government entities, and the general public.  In the three years before he lost his battle with leukemia, Stanford caused an enormous improvement in the Seattle Public Schools. His methods and practices could be employed in any school system, with great benefit not only to the students, but also to teachers, staff, businesses, and the public.  But also read [[ASIN:0807031275 Radical Equations: Civil Rights from Mississippi to the Algebra Project]], by Robert P. Moses.  Moses' book complements Stanford's.  If you are a parent of school-age children, or expect to be, and you want the best possible education for your children, you need the Algebra Project, which was started by Robert Moses, and is described in his book.  Both books should be required reading for every school administrator and everyone involved in the selection of a school administrator.	2000-10-13

Miles is the target of blackmail by a Vor lord who wants to be confirmed as a Count, and Miles' love quest is unintentionally sabotaged by one of his friends.  The would-be Count learns that Miles' response to attempted blackmail is not quite what he had anticipated, he attempts revenge with surprising, delightful, and hilarious results.

When Clancy discusses espionage  and military tactics and hardware, he speaks from knowledge and makes it interesting.  Tom Clancy doesn't write great (literary) novels, but this one, like most of his, is great escape reading.

But Clancy is not an economist, and the book really drags when he spends pages at a stretch arguing in favor of a flat income tax and a reduced capital gains tax.  He apparently doesn't notice the  inconsistency, that a lower tax rate for capital gains creates, ipso facto, a non-flat tax.  The claimed justification for special favorable tax treatment of capital gains, \\"to promote capital investment,\\" is a totally meretricious argument, the sole purpose of which is to provide a windfall for the rich by shifting the tax burden to the poor and middle classes.  Making Jack Ryan promote such sleaze is out of character with the decent, intelligent man Clancy has previously portrayed Jack Ryan to be.    Clancy should stick with the themes of espionage, intrigue, and  military action that he does so well.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2000-09-07

Michael Goulder is an outstanding biblical scholar, who usually writes for a scholarly audience, but this book was written for the general reader interested in the history of the Bible and of Christianity.  Goulder is no Isaac Asimov, but he does manage to write a book the interested layman can  understand.  It requires more effort on the reader's part than it would if Asimov had written it, but the effort is still not excessive, and is well worth it.    Paul, a Jew who had been strongly opposed to the \\"Followers of the Way\\" (the proto-Christian movement within Judaism) experienced something on the road to Damascus which converted him from an opponent of the Jesus movement to an ardent supporter.  Paul was convinced that Jesus' message was not just for Jews, but for all humanity.  He took his mission out of Israel, where most of the people were Jews, to Turkey and elsewhere where there were few Jews.  He wisely realized that few Gentiles would accept circumcision and the strict Kosher (food) laws of Judaism as a condition of joining the churches Paul was founding, so he downplayed these tough requirements, and did not seek to enforce them.  Peter and Jesus' brother James, meanwhile, remained in Jerusalem and kept  the Jewish Law entirely.  They sent out pairs of missionaries to the  churches Paul had established, and these missionaries tried to bring the  far-flung churches into line with Jewish law, which Peter and James saw as  essential, but which Paul saw as superseded by Jesus.    It will likely  never be possible to determine which position the historical Jesus would  have taken in this controversy (quite possibly somewhere between Peter and  Paul), but it is clear that the Pauline position won out; it has even been suggested that Paul, rather than Jesus, was the founder of Christianity, and in a sense he surely was.    This book is a must read for anyone who  wants to know and understand the beginnings of Christianity.  Read it and  make up your own mind!watziznaym@gmail.com	2000-09-03

As might reasonably be expected, Cone has matured and learned his craft better over the years.  The older essays are still worth reading, but the  best ones are those he wrote during the eighties and nineties, especially  the ones he wrote in 1994 and 1998.    Cone's \\"Black Theology\\" is  a \\"Liberation Theology.\\"  Cone contends that liberation is the  central message of the Bible.  While it is clear that a message of  liberation can be found in the Bible, it is not the central message of the  Torah or the Prophets.  The particular liberation that these books extoll  is liberation OF THE JEWS.  Not until the Pauline Epistles and the  lectionaries of Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John do we get some hint of a  message of liberation for everybody.  Even then, the message of liberation  is not really for everyone; Paul advises slaves to obey their masters  \\"in all things\\", and advises masters to give their servants  \\"that which is just and equal,\\" (Col. 3:22-4:1)    But although  Cone sometimes overstates his case, this is definitely a book to be taken  seriously.  Cone gives us whites the opportunity to see ourselves thru the  eyes of an intelligent and articulate black person.  We may not greatly  like all that we see, but it is up to US to remake ourselves into  non-racists.  Neither James Cone, nor Malcolm X., nor Martin Luther King,  nor Whitney Young, nor any of their black successors can do that for us.   WE must act.  Cone can help show us how, but WE must take seriously the  need to change ourselves.  We must cure ourselves of racism, and sexism,  and every other ism that permits us to discount others because of their  race, religion, sex, sexuality, etc.    If we don't realize that there is a  problem, we are not going to solve it.  Read \\"Risks of Faith.\\"   If you are not a Christian, just ignore Cone's Christian bias.  It isn't  essential to the insights you can obtain from the book.  Insights into the  content and pervasiveness of racism can help Atheists, Buddhists, Hindus,  Jews, Muslims, Pagans, and others, as well as Christians to see where their  act needs cleaning up and to get going on what needs to be done.    This  book should strike a responsive chord especially among Jews, who have been  persecuted in most of the same ways, and just as unfairly, as  blacks.    Thank you, James H. Cone, for \\"Risks of Faith.\\"  Keep  up the good work.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2000-07-29

You can enjoy a great story without understanding either of  these literary touches, but they do add a nice bit of spice.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2000-07-28

At the beginning he has only Jones, then Loving joins his staff, and finally (after Ben proves her innocent of a murder  charge) Christina.  The plot is well constructed, and Ben and Christina  make a great pair.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2000-07-24

He was effective both in fund-raising and in resolving conflicts.  He learned to speak the language of the whites he had to deal  with, so that they preferred to deal with him rather than with more  militant black leaders who were unable or unwilling to speak to whites in  terms whites were used to.  He had the knack of knowing how far he could  push whites toward fairness to blacks without getting their backs up, but  never taking a straight \\"no\\" for an answer.  He would accept less  than what he really wanted, but always more than the other side really  wanted to give.  He made good use of the fact that prejudiced whites would  generally prefer to compromise with him rather than deal with the more  confrontational black leaders.      Dickerson recounts Young's life from  birth to death.  It is a story well worth reading, of a brilliant and  dedicated person who made a substantial contribution to the progress of  racial relations, and whose methods future leaders could do well to study  and emulate.    Unfortunately, the narrative drags at times.  Young brought to each new challenge the same impressive list of strengths; enumerating them yet again eventually becomes tiresome.      watziznaym@gmail.com	2000-07-21

Ben Kinkaid and Christina McCall are very likeable persons;  reading another of their adventures is like a reunion with old friends.  I  was reading for enjoyment, not to look for fault to find.  Granted, the  editor(s) should have caught and corrected such errors as the body count at  the Murrah Office Building, but that is hardly pivotal to plot or character  development.    On page 436 of the paperback edition, the author states:  \\"The environmental facts, statistics, and information presented in  this book are true, all taken from unbiased sources.  All the actions  depicted in the conflict between loggers and environmentalists are based on  true events . . . .\\"    What better way to learn about these facts than  coincidentally in the reading of an entertaing and engaging story?    watziznaym@gmail.com	2000-07-20

Gives a  good picture of life then, a fair treatment of native Americans, and an  eye-opening look at some of the absurd ways women were disrespected in  those times.    This is NOT a book written for juveniles or young adults,  but anyone in those age groups could read and enjoy it.  I would highly  recommend it for high school students as an adjunct to an American History  course.  They might also want to read Monfredo's other Glynis Tryon novels  and Kenneth Roberts' [[ASIN:0892723866 Rabble in Arms]], [[ASIN:0892723645 Arundel]], and  others.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2000-07-19

Everything I have read of his has been very good or better, and I have read most of his books.  In addition to a good plot and page-turning action, Hillerman gives the reader a look as  from the inside at Native American cultures (mostly Dinee (Navaho)).  Hillerman has  received an award from the Dinee people for being a true friend of Dinee culture.  Without being at all preachy, Hillerman has given us an  opportunity to see the world thru Dinee eyes, which is sometimes a better world-view than ours.

It is a story of adventure and exploration, not only exploration of unknown physical territory, but also  of serious philosophical and ethical questions.  In this respect, it could  be compared to Edgar Pangborn's [[ASIN:1882968301 Davy]], but the latter considers a much different set of philosophical and ethical questions.

(Not for strictly accurate detail, but for the feel and genius of two fine religious traditions.)  The heroes are Sam  Kalkin, who becomes the Buddha, and the Death-god, Yama.  The villains are Brahma and his crowd, whose god-like powers have gone to their heads, and Renfrew Nirriti, the proselytizer who is willing to ally himself with  anyone, no matter how evil, to force his religious views on others. (Nirriti means \\"not right.\\")    This is not merely Zelazny's best,  but one of the best books of the twentieth century.  It ranks with  Heinlein's [[ASIN:0340837950 Stranger in a Strange Land]], Panshin's [[ASIN:B000FA5TAG Rite of Passage]], Butler's [[ASIN:0446675504 Parable of the Sower]] and [[ASIN:0446610380 Parable of the Talents]] and Card's [[ASIN:1904233023 Ender's Game (The Ender Saga)]]; and only slightly below  Pangborn's [[ASIN:B000L974LS Davy]].    watziznaym@gmail.com	2000-07-17

(The other is [[ASIN:1882968301 Davy]], by Edgar Pangborn.)    The book presents a clear and convincing explanation of how and why the Gospels were written.  Knowing this, it becomes possible much better to appreciate the wonderful, beautiful person Jesus was; to understand his message of inclusive love; to cast aside the distracting nonsense of the unbelievable literalist interpretation of the Gospels, so that one can try to see the picture of  Jesus the Gospel writers intended their audience to receive.    Some critics  would deny Spong the right to call himself a Christian, or to call the God he worships \\"God.\\"  Maybe they are right, but whatever name someone calls it by will not change Spong's faith by one iota.    Albeit I do not share Spong's faith, I recognize that it has in it a large measure of truth and goodness and beauty.  It is probably not precisely the faith that Jesus held, but it resembles it much more than does the \\"Christian\\" faith of the perpetrators of the crusades, the  inquisition, the holocaust, and the ethnic cleansing of Bosnia.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2000-07-17

But if you can bear to know the truth, and be set free, then buy, beg, or borrow (don't steal) this  excellent book!    I was privileged to sit at the feet (there weren't enough  chairs) of John Shelby Spong when he gave two lectures in Nashville, last  month.  Except for physical features, Bishop Spong is himself remarkably  like the picture of Jesus that emerges when you learn with your mind to  hear the Bible as it was intended to be heard.    I bought 3 of his books on  the spot, and 2 more since.  These are not books to be read like novels; you should have a Bible and a dictionary and [[ASIN:051734582X Asimov's Guide to the Bible: A Historical Look at the Old and New Testaments]] handy when you read them.  But they are much more than worth the effort.  These are books to think about and react to and learn from.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2000-07-17

Is there a True Prophet, a genuine Holy Man, alive today?  I don't know, but if there is, his name is John Shelby Spong.  Like the Hebrew prophets of old, Spong tells us in clear terms what is wrong, and what must be done  to save the situation.  The ancient prophets were trying to save their  beloved nation of Israel; Spong is trying to save his beloved vision of God  and Christ. To save what he finds good and beautiful in Christianity, much  that is silly and nonsensical must be abandoned.  For example, the Gospels  must be read as the writers of the Gospels intended them, not as literal  historical fact.  Spong shows us how.  This infuriates the fundamentalists,  just as Jesus' liberalism infuriated the conservatives of 30 C.E. I am not as yet convinced of Spong's version of \\"Christianity,\\" but I cannot be certain he is wrong.  That is more than can be said for the orthodox version.    watziznaym@gmail.com	2000-07-15
