If you want a real story of the 60's radicals and not a fuzzy,whitewashed,'we had good intentions'nonsense then here is a fine place to start.Horowitz recounts often in minute detail the mindset of those who would apologize,rationalize and canonize murderous totalitarian regimes,dictators and political ideologies like marxism that made life a living hell for billions of people in the 20th century.Horowitz doesn't let the intellectual charlatans like Sarte,Shaw,Chomsky,Hayden,Mailer and various radicals of their ilk off the hook;their playing dumb or rationalizing mass murder in the name of progressiveness simply does not fly anymore.Today the radicals are seen for what they were: spoiled and mostly affluent thugs and barbarians who hid their lust for power and domination behind slogans of peace,justice and equality to further the agenda of overthrowing society so that they,the noble saviors,would step in and lead humanity down the proper path-straight into gas chambers and reeducation camps in all probability.Count your blessings they never had the opportunity.Horowitz finally came to realize that what he was actively supporting was a return to the dark ages,a dystopian hell built with pretty slogans and o so seemingly noble gestures.The demagoguery,dishonest presuppositions about America and capitalism,the hatred of Democracy precisely because it allows the little man to live his life the way he sees fit and not according to the arbiters of culture and other such Stalinesque vultures who would kill and enslave people for their 'own good';this is the way of the radical,and Horowitz gives the creature a thorough and deserved drubbing.Horowitz lightly touches on a persistent motif of radical movements,namely,that it is the offspring of the affluent,trustee babies,Hollywood stars and academics (who've never had to hold a real job in the real world-another characheristic of the type) who lead such movements;that precisely those who've most benefitted from Democracy andcapitalism are those who seek to deny it to others.An excellent book by the title of _Guilt blame and politics_ might be of some help to you in exploring this phenomenon in depth.	2002-06-13

The point cannot be missed by anyone who reads this book that Islamic fundamentalism is essentially the longing for time to reverse itself so that the glory days of the old world  may return again.                                                       This is symptomatic of many of the hellish regimes and political movements of the 20th century.In nazi Germany it took the form of reviving Norse gods,symbols and using pagan rituals to invoke power and fortune for the Aryan conquerors.                                                As the constant flux of 20th century life began to set in,a large chunk of the world affected by such mass upheavel and endless change reverted to nationalistic fervor,religious fundamentalism  and hopes for utopia based, oddly enough,on modern science and technology-the very means by which the modern chaos enveloped the world.                                                     Islamic fundamentalism is little more than a childish,confused,frightened,angry response to a world that doesn't any longer make sense to those who hold a medieval worldview.It has nothing positive,intelligent,useful  or constructive in its ideology.It is bankrupt and doomed to bring more of the same misery,envy,hatred,poverty and warfare.

It is almost impossible for any casual observer to not notice that the hard-core left seems more like a religion than a political or philosophical movement.Over the years I've found it difficult to have any kind of debate with leftists.They rely on their feelings,never logic,facts or reasonable deductions to give a rational argument.Of course,if you disagree with them,you're a bigot,homophobe or whatever word that calls you out as a heathen who does't buy into their faith.Make no bones about it,the Marxist,Communist,Socialist,Radical feminist,Hate Western Civilizationist,Environmentalist pantheon is a religious impulse,however bankrupt.Their faiths are merely secular salvations,replete with utopian ideas,a naive assertion that man is perfectable but that the current society is what is keeping his perfection from coming about,so it is necessary to listen to Saint Marx or some similar prophet to lead the people into the promised land.There were many attempts to bring this utopia into the world in the 20th century,and the results were all too predictable.Of course,the apologists for the failed secular religions of the 20th century claim that the actual manifestations of the noble ideas were not what was intended,but tell me,can 100,000,000 dead people be wrong?Where their La La land utopia goes wrong is that coercion or brute force becomes necessary to get the mass in line with what the pure-hearted shepherds demand of them Again,does not 100,000,000 dead say all that needs to be said?.It may no longer be respectable to be openly Marxist or Communist but that in no way means the old leftover left has stopped believing in their religion.They just hide their real agendas inside multicultural,feminist and social sciences.Their intent is still what it has always been:Undermine Western civilization,bring even the notions of truth and scientific logic into question,and let this slow-acting poison trickle through the culture,and sad to say,they have suceeded imfamously.The old line leftists may have started to die off but their pernicious influence is more stealth and pervasive than ever.Thanks to Mr. Horowitz for exposing these people for what they are.	2002-02-18

Goldberg points out what any remotely observant person has long known:that the media tilts decidedly leftward.It is in the mass media of course,and in academia,where the self-anointed saviours of the human race(good Socialists all)can enlighten us poor ignorant grunts and lead us into Utopia.Goldberg keeps a rather narrow focus and the book sort of bogs down.For a wider view of the Left's \\"Long March\\" through American institutions, David Horowitz or Roger Kimball's _Tenured radicals_ will be of help.	2002-01-15
