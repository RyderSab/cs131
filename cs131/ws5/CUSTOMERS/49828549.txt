US	49828549	RM0CSYVWKHW5W	0671027360	141370518	Angels & Demons	Books	1	31	39	N	N	Preposterous	Early in this novel, our hero finds out that a container of antimatter has been hidden somewhere in the Vatican, and that if he doesn't find it in time, the city will be blown sky-high.  I could think of one obvious place the antimatter might have been stowed. I turned to my other half and said, \\"Mark my words. The antimatter will be found (insert spoilers here).\\"  <br /> <br />And, of course, it was. And so I got rather sick of Robert Langdon missing the obvious hiding place and instead blundering around Rome, wasting precious time, and narrowly failing to rescue various Church luminaries. I wanted to smack him--none of the cardinals need have died if Langdon had been able to figure out the SECRET HIDING PLACE that I figured out at once.  And I'm not a Harvard professor. <br /> <br />Add to that Langdon's completely implausible escape from certain death, which was the sort of thing that only works in the movies. I'd love to see Myth Busters poke holes in that scene. Langdon would have been toast. <br /> <br />I'll leave it to others to point out holes in Brown's art history; it's been a long time since I took art history and I'll admit I'm rusty.  As for me, I'll just say that the plot managed to be both over-the-top and dull at the same time. Also, don't you just *love* Dan Brown's \\"strong\\" female characters who seem to do very little other than wear skimpy clothing, get kidnapped, get rescued, and fulfill the hero's yoga-goddess fantasies? <br /> <br />Ugh.	2005-10-14

Byatt's _Possession_ that got me addicted to the historical-interest mysteries that are in vogue lately. I've come to really love the sort of book where people hunt around looking for ancient artifacts or long-lost manuscripts. So I couldn't resist picking up _The Seventh Unicorn_, which tells the story of a (fictional) seventh tapestry in the (real) \\"Lady and the Unicorn\\" series, and two former lovers who rekindle their romance while trying to preserve it. <br /> <br />This book is not bad at all. It is, however, a first novel, and there are two things about it that just didn't work for me. First, the male lead, Jake, doesn't appeal to me as much as he's supposed to. Even if he was having problems with his fiancee before running into his former lover, he would have at least spared his fiancee half a thought in the course of several hundred pages. Instead, she seems to vanish for about two-thirds of the book and is much less important to the story than she should be. <br /> <br />Second, the author was perhaps a bit too easy on the characters. I'm used to novels like this having some conflict--some cutthroat tactics, some suspense, at least some interpersonal tension. Instead, the denouement of this book seems to be a series of things falling too perfectly, too easily, into place. Characters I thought were menacing turned out to be merely gruff but well-meaning. Exes who should have been bitter, instead smile and nod magnanimously. And the Deep Dark Secret that underpins the story was too easily guessed. I think the prologue telegraphed far too much of the plot. <br /> <br />Again, this book was not bad at all, and I did like it. However, I think it needed some more conflict. It was just a bit too placid.	2005-10-04

Book 3 was the one that really sucked me in, with its tightly woven, ever-twisting plot. Book 4 sprawled a bit too much but brought lots of romance and character development. Book 5, too, meandered far too much and lacked the comic relief that lightened earlier books, but resonated with deep tragedy. <br /> <br />Here, Rowling presents a Book 6 that is as tight as Book 3, has as much romance and character development as Book 4, involves a tragedy as profound as that of book 5 (or maybe more so, as I'm not convinced that the character who died in book 5 is really dead), and is sprinkled throughout by moments as funny as the best ones from books 1 and 2. <br /> <br />She has set up so much interesting stuff, I have no idea how she's going to fit it all into one final book. <br /> <br />Overall: Whoa.	2005-07-18
US	49828549	R3OTFAQDVP3YJE	0944276180	812996579	The Rain Maiden	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Real historical fiction dressed up as a romance novel	I picked this up used because I liked the pretty cover (semi-nude woman draped in a sort of green mist) and thought it might be a pleasant romance novel to pass the time.  I was happily surprised when I realized that this was more than the average romance novel.  Underneath the uber-girly cover and the critics' blurbs extolling its sex scenes, this is a real historical novel that looks honestly at all the horror beneath the pageantry of medieval times. <br /> <br />The protagonist is Isabel of Hainault, a young heiress who is pushed into a marriage with the young crown prince of France, later King Philippe-Auguste.  Isabel is only ten years old at her marriage, but seems much older to all around her--she is mentally sharp, physically developed--and also sexually precocious, due to having been molested by her father and uncle.  She and Philippe share a tumultuous, passionate marriage amid the politics of the day.  Ten years later Isabel dies in childbirth at the age of twenty. That's not a spoiler; it's in the prologue and in the cover blurb.  During Isabel's short life, she is integrally involved in the betrayal, adultery, incest, and political maneuvering that were rampant in her time.  The author brings the nasty underbelly of the Middle Ages to life through the eyes of a interesting heroine, who is emotionally still a child at times, but forced to be an adult at an early age. <br /> <br />My only quibble with this book is that I didn't find it half as interesting after Isabel's death.  It just sort of seemed to me that it dragged on past its natural climax. I can see why the author did it. The final storyline involving Philippe's crusade with Richard of England does resolve the tension between the two men and show how little Philippe gained by breaking his wife's heart in her last days, but I don't really like either of the men and wasn't into the story at that point.  Also, Sibylla's behavior after Isabel's death stretched credibility pretty far. Her sudden change of heart made no sense to me.	2005-06-15

Women with mystical powers? Check. Faeries? Check. Ireland? Check.  In fact, I think the only reason I didn't discover this book earlier is that it was published in 1991, and I only started reading fantasy sometime in the late nineties. <br /> <br />The story begins with Emily, a bratty but endearing girl of fifteen, poised on the edge of adulthood in the early 20th century.  Emily knows she is special, set apart-and when she sees the faeries in the wood by her family's home, she knows she will never be satisfied with ordinary life.  Emily makes a colossal mess of things, as bratty fifteen-year-olds will do, and sets in motion events that will affect generations to come. <br /> <br />What follows is a fairy tale, but not precisely a tale of faeries; it's more of an exploration of the nature of reality and of myth, as seen through the eyes of Emily and two other women: Jessica, a glib-tongued teenager of the 1930s whose tall tales have an uncanny way of coming true; and Enye, a woman of the late 1980s, torn between everyday life and a battle with supernatural forces from the world beyond. <br /> <br />This is a stunning story and one that I'll probably reread over and over again.  It doesn't suffer one bit from the ailment that afflicts so many multigenerational novels-the tendency for one or more of the intertwined stories to lack luster.  All three of the women, and their lives and times, are vivid and passionate.  And I must say, there are few male authors who can write such nuanced and three-dimensional female characters.  Get your hands on a used copy of this.  I wish they'd reprint it... <br />	2005-06-03

It starts with a drop-dead gorgeous but unemployed woman, Melody, using her sex appeal to manipulate her way into a starring role on a cooking show.  Never mind that she can't cook. <br /> <br />From there, however, it becomes a cute, lightweight romance that isn't bad at all.  Melody matures a great deal throughout the book, becoming more mature and responsible while retaining her spunk and spirit.  The male lead, Logan, becomes more annoying as Melody becomes less so.  He's looking for a woman who can be a good mother to his son, ignoring his feelings for Melody and the constant proof the she's great with kids--from her adorable bonding with Logan's son to her rescuing abandoned kittens--because he has the idea that only a staid, conventional woman could make a good mother.  The rest of the novel is devoted to finding out whether Logan will ever wise up. <br /> <br />I did hope there would be a little more *witchcraft* in this book!  If it's going to be titled \\"The Kitchen Witch\\", and star a witch and a man who's a little afraid of witches, and be set in Salem--I want a little more magic than, say, a red candle getting lit when the characters are about to get it on.  I don't like novels that read like Witchcraft 101 primers--but this goes too far in the other direction.  The story could have been better either by dropping the witch angle entirely or by having more fun with it.	2005-05-25

In the Sleeping Beauty chapter, for example, she delves into the psyche of a young woman just awakening into sexuality; for Beauty and the Beast she explores a woman's experience with courtship and the beginning of marriage, and for the tale of Demeter she talks about being an older woman, watching one's child choose her own path.  These are just a few examples. For every tale Gould draws parallels to other, more modern novels and movies that contain fairy-tale archetypes, like Jane Eyre, Pretty Woman, The Story of O, Harry Potter, and Wuthering Heights.  I saw myself reflected over and over in these pages, both in the chapter that best fit my current circumstances and in all those that preceded it.  I concur with the reviewer who says she wished she'd had this book when she was 18.  It just \\"clicks\\" so well with things I'd experienced but not known how to name, and ties them in with the stories I've always loved, revealing to me just why those stories never lose their resonance with me. <br /> <br />My only quibble is that Gould focuses more on the biological aspects of womanhood--menstruation, sex, childbirth, menopause--than on other sorts of choices women make, like career and creativity.  She does mention these things, but they are not given as much emphasis.	2005-05-24

Cornelia, Brutus, Coel, Genvissa, Asterion, and assorted friends and enemies are walking the earth yet again, as is a mysterious new character who has the potential to throw a wrench in all of their best-laid plans. <br /> <br />This is Cornelia's story more than anyone else's, as she matures further.  Noah, as she is called in this life, is a far cry from the bratty Cornelia of Hades' Daughter, and even the staunchly loyal Caela of Gods' Concubine.  Here, Noah begins to question everything she had previously accepted, including the Troy Game and her love for Brutus.  At first, she begins to teeter into Mary Sue-ness.  She is becoming ever more powerful, and it seems like everybody in the entire world is in love with her.  But she really wins my heart around the middle of the book, when she begins to break free of the things everyone expects her to do and choose for herself.  She makes a shocking choice-one that could destroy many lives, or redeem them.  I am really beginning to like this character-and I'm getting quite sick of Brutus.  It almost seemed in Gods' Concubine that he might become a decent man after all, but his issues really come back in Darkwitch Rising.  I'm sort of hoping Cornelia/Caela/Noah kicks him to the curb in the next book. <br /> <br />What didn't work for me: How to say this without spoilers?  About halfway through the book, Douglass throws a twist into the plot.  Two characters turn out to be the reincarnations of different characters than the reader previously believed.  This switch didn't work for me. There were a few sentences that foreshadowed it, but overall, I think the two characters acted much more like the people I had assumed them to be. <br />	2005-05-23

Workaholic interior designer Pamela is on a business trip to Las Vegas.  Reeling from an abusive marriage, she's hoping her heart isn't entirely dead yet.  She accidentally weaves her desire for romance into a spell binding the goddess Artemis to her aid, and Artemis sends her brother Apollo to woo Pamela. <br /> <br />Apollo and Pamela fall in love, of course.  I didn't think their relationship was developed as well as Lina and Hades' relationship in Goddess of Spring.  It seemed more like Apollo and Pamela fell into bed a couple of times and then declared themselves soul mates.  Besides, I can't see Apollo as a romantic hero.  There is one point where Pamela muses about how Apollo isn't going to stifle her as her husband did.  Hello?  Burning Coronis to a crisp for cheating on him? Chasing Daphne till she had no choice but to turn into a tree?  Punishing Cassandra for not wanting to sleep with him?  He comes off as rather piggish in myth, and none of that is really dealt with except for a few offhand comments about how he's not the same guy anymore because his love for Pamela has changed him.  In under a week?  I doubt it.  It's just, BANG! he's a nice guy now, without a single iota of his former personality resurfacing.  At least Hades, for all his brooding darkness, always seemed in the stories to actually love his wife.  And the angsty aspect of his personality was also a plot point in the novel, and an obstacle to his relationship with Lina.  Here, Apollo is perfect beyond belief.  I also can't really buy Artemis as a promiscuous blonde bombshell. <br /> <br />And the ending seemed wrong, too.  Let's just say, for fear of spoilers, that the characters seemed a lot less interesting at the end, particularly Pamela. <br />	2005-05-23

I never did really get into Cast's first novel, Goddess by Mistake, and I love the Persephone myth and didn't want to be disappointed.  But finally I decided to read Goddess of Spring-and liked it! <br /> <br />Lina, a baker from Tulsa, needs a miracle to save her bakery.  She finds it in the form of a mysterious, mystical cookbook, which contains a killer pizza recipe-and an invocation to the goddess Demeter.  Demeter is willing to help Lina for a price: Lina must trade places with Demeter's daughter Persephone and travel to the Underworld. <br /> <br />There, Lina masquerades as Persephone and meets Hades, the god of the Underworld, who is a hot Byronic sort of hero.  The two begin to fall in love, but can their budding relationship survive both lovers' insecurities, or the revelation of the truth about Lina?   <br /> <br />This is a sexy and fun love story, mostly lighthearted, but you might need your Kleenex by the end! <br /> <br />Oh, and the dread steeds and Cerberus are hilarious and cute.	2005-05-23

But she thought the stories were just that--fairy tales--until someone takes the story seriously enough to burglarize Maggi's apartment and assault her elderly aunt in the hopes of finding this chalice.  Now Maggi has to find the chalice herself, before the bad guys get their hands on it, and before anyone else gets hurt. And along the way, she has to deal with her confusing feelings for two men-one an ex-priest and a friend of her aunt's, and the other an infuriating ex-lover who may or may not be connected with a society committed to destroying the Grail.  Maggi doesn't know which man she should trust, as violence escalates all around her. <br /> <br />With its Goddess lore, secret societies, and relentless action, A.K.A. Goddess is reminiscent of The Da Vinci Code.  But I have to admit-though Da Vinci Code is a much-acclaimed hardback and A.K.A Goddess a series paperback romance, I enjoyed A.K.A. Goddess more.  I think it's because Maggi is a strong woman who is willing to kick butt and take names, while Dan Brown's women sometimes seem like mere sidekicks despite his lip service to the Goddess cause.   <br /> <br />Anyway, I was glued to this book, and will definitely be following this series. <br />	2005-05-21

That historical romance novel she doesn't like to 'fess up to? My all-time favorite of the genre. Her historical novel about Japanese prison camps in WWII? Loved it. Her previous Jane Jeffry books? Funny and entertaining. Her Grace and Favor books? Fascinating and quite touching. <br /> <br />Bell, Book, and Scandal?  Either ghostwritten, or written under duress to satisfy some sort of contractual obligation. <br /> <br />Seriously, I can't find Churchill's voice in this plodding story. There is no humor to be found. There is really no attention given to the inner thoughts of Jane, and a mind-numbing amount of attention paid to every mundane little thing she does--right down to a conversation between Jane and Shelley about how one of them is glad she brought her WaterPik because she's eating raspberries.   <br /> <br />There is also little to no danger. The stakes are never raised. <br /> <br />The best scenes in *Bell* are the scenes where Jane is trying to sell her novel to agents and editors. In these scenes, we actually do get emotionally involved with the story, and Jane begins to almost sound like Jane again. <br /> <br />But besides that, this story plods without direction and then ends with a sudden and awkward ending that made me wonder if I was missing pages.   <br /> <br />I miss the funny, wry Jane!

Assaulted by a stranger, abused by her father, Alli decides early that God isn't as great as he's cracked up to be.  What follows is 200-odd pages of death, rape, murder, stalking, tangled relationships, and most of all, a scathing indictment of the church and its patriarchal structures. <br /> <br />This book isn't bad, though the author is so intent on showing the dark underbelly of Mormon life that she seems to include *only* negative elements in her story. Almost nothing good ever happens to any of these characters. Also, the book is maybe too fast-paced, with the author dashing off a few quick sentences to sum up whole years--years which could have been interesting to read about. <br /> <br />Another, smaller gripe is that all of the characters' names seem to begin with C or K. It gets confusing.  There are even a Cathy and a Kathy.	2005-05-11

She and her beautiful, ditzy sister find a creepy-looking tarot deck on a vacation to Egypt, and not long afterward, weird things start happening. Rae inherits her mentor's mansion, meets an enigmatic foreign man, and runs into her high school flame once again.   <br /> <br />The exposition is where it all starts to fall apart.  For starters, one of the essential elements of the Gothic novel is that the heroine--and the reader--can't tell which man is the bad guy till the climax of the story.  Here, I figured it out right away, and Rae wasn't fooled for very long either. I stayed tuned, expecting a twist, but no twist ever came. <br /> <br />I also hated the treatment of Rae's sister.  It seemed to me that the character suffered unfairly.  Was the character being punished for her beauty and charm? The punishment seemed like too much--especially after the sister's past was revealed and it turned out that she had known as much pain as Rae. <br /> <br />Overall, a diverting read, but forgettable and not without problems.	2005-04-28

I fall somewhere in the middle.  I feel that the books have their thrilling points but overall just sort of bore me. <br /> <br />What works for me: The first few chapters of the first book (disturbing but beautifully written), and the last few chapters of the last book (sublime).  These scenes resonate with the archetypal motifs of familiar fairy tales, and are emotionally intense.   <br /> <br />What doesn't work for me: Endless scenes of spanking, and later, endless scenes of \\"pony boy\\" training.  Even if those *were* my personal kinks, and they're not, the scenes would still be repetitive.  The fact that most of the story has nothing to do with the Sleeping Beauty legend.  Most of all, what doesn't work is the lack of emotional depth throughout most of the tale.  It's proven that the brain is the most important sex organ, but for chapter after chapter it's all \\"tab A in slot B\\" with no glimpses into the characters' heads.   <br /> <br />At one point toward the end of the first book, Beauty muses about how the BDSM tortures of the castle don't frighten her, and that what really scares her is being left alone with her own mind, a mind that too easily slips back into the misty aimlessness of her long sleep.  Now, that was interesting, and so much more could have been done with further exploration of Beauty's psyche.  But the moment passed--and we were back to spankings and thrustings and not much else.	2005-02-18

Yes, this was printed on a low budget, but what you're getting when you buy this book is far from cheap. <br /> <br />If you're like me: If you loved fairy tales as a girl, if you grew up and started seeing adult meanings in all those brooding beasts and innocent beauties, this book is for you.  If you, like me, were sucked in by the breathtaking first scenes of Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty series but got bored with the endless spankings and the focus on the physical almost to the exclusion of the psychological--this book is for you. <br /> <br />Nancy Madore has written a wonderful collection of erotic stories based on the tales you've always loved.  The prose is elegant--perhaps a bit arch in a delicious sort of way--and never vulgar.  I highly recommend it.  I especially loved \\"East o'the Sun, West o'the Moon\\" and \\"Beauty and the Beast\\". <br /> <br />The only issue I have is with the story \\"The Ugly Duckling.\\"  It's a nice story and makes an excellent point about the impossible beauty standards women are held to in our society--but to me it's more of a rant than an erotic tale.  It just sort of doesn't go with the tone of the other stories, I guess.  Madore deals better with the beauty-standards issue in \\"Mirror on the Wall\\", when the moral flows more naturally with the story.	2005-02-17

Though, a few pages in, I wondered why the designer bothered to change Dante's \\"Proserpina\\" from a brunette to a redhead considering that the heroine of the book was also a brunette.  But I digress. <br /> <br />Our heroine has a secret identity.  Once a prostitute, she is now undercover as the Midnight Angel, who rescues women from the streets and helps them return to respectable work.  She becomes embroiled in a crime investigation, and winds up working with her former lover, and sparks fly as they race against time to rescue a young girl from a twisted Druidic cult. <br /> <br />What worked for me:  The heroine wasn't innocent!  I loved the conflict within her as she desired to be passionate with her lover but felt compelled to hide her experience from him.  It was a realistic struggle that was more interesting than the parade of virgins who simper their way through most romance novels.  Also, I liked the cult.  Twisted version of paganism as it was, it was still fun to see White-Goddess-ish material in the novel. <br /> <br />What didn't work for me: Mostly, the whole idea of the Midnight Angel sweeping hookers off into \\"real\\" occupations.  I've read several novels depicting the same period, very well-researched ones like *The Crimson Petal and the White* and *Slammerkin*.  Many of the women who were prostitutes during this period got into \\"the life\\" not because they had no other opportunities, but because the other opportunities were even more grueling and degrading.  I just can't see these women gushing, \\"Oh, Midnight Angel, thank you so much for saving me from prostitution so I can work 20 hours a day in a sweatshop instead!\\"	2005-02-10

Then cheating boyfriend comes back and has the gall to get mad that she was involved with other guys while they were broken up--and she doesn't even call him on the carpet for it--and then makes an unreasonable demand of her.  And she caves. <br /> <br />I don't like to write negative reviews, since I know they're hurtful to authors, but this book just ticked me off.  Between the main plot and the subplot involving Trina's sister, it seemed like the author's point was \\"Settle down with the first guy who claims to love you.  You'll never find anyone else, and he'll only cheat on you a little bit.\\" <br /> <br />Ugh.	2005-01-27

This anthology is a collection of crime and mystery stories based on old fairy tales.  If you like crime stories, or fairy tales, or both, this book will be enjoyable to you. <br /> <br />Enter a world where the Snow Queen deals coke, the mob boss's twelve daughters are sneaking out every night, and Sleeping Beauty isn't sleeping but instead being held for ransom.  Oh, and one of Cinderella's stepsisters is suing, and both Snow White and Rapunzel have serious mental problems.   <br /> <br />My favorite was probably Kristine Kathryn Rusch's \\"Love and Justice\\", a sad tale in which Cinderella is found dead after becoming estranged from her husband, and a reluctant guardsman must find out whodunnit, even if he doesn't like the answer.	2004-11-24

I bought the previous book in this series, Hades' Daughter, because it was based loosely on Greek and British myth.  I shelved it for a long time because I hated the characters.  I finally, reluctantly, read it again, because I was still interested in its storyline--and realized that despite the characters, I did like the book. <br /> <br />And then I devoured Gods' Concubine in two days, and can't wait until the third installment, which is supposed to take place during the Restoration period. <br /> <br />Gods' Concubine is better than its predecessor.  First of all, the plot is more complex.  It's less all-battles-all-the-time and has a lot more plotting and politics in it.  And secondly, more importantly, the characters are developing splendidly! <br /> <br />Brutus has been reborn this time as William the Conqueror, and his feisty wife Matilda is doing her best to tame him into a decent husband.  Coel is his noble rival, Harold Godwineson, and he is wed to Swanne, who is none other than Genvissa reborn.  Cornelia, who remembers nothing of her past, is Caela, neglected wife of Edward the Confessor, and sister to Harold.  Brutus/William is becoming kinder and growing a little bit of common sense.  Cornelia/Caela is developing a backbone.  And Genvissa/Swanne is becoming weaker and more vulnerable.  All the while, Asterion waits and watches, hidden behind the mask of one of Edward's courtiers, his true identity unknown. <br /> <br />With their lusts and machinations, their struggles and games, these people will shape history.   And I, for one, will be reading on.	2004-11-18

Packing up all his earthly belongings, and his three daughters--romantic Vernelia, neurotic Amy, and practical, skeptical Kate--he and his wife move to a tiny village in upstate New York to await the end of days.  There, the charming, charismatic, and utterly horrifying Fitcher takes a shine to Vernelia, and sweeps her off her feet in a whirlwind courtship. <br /> <br />It says on the very cover that it's a Bluebeard story, so I'm not spoiling much to say that Vernelia goes mysteriously missing, and Fitcher then marries Amy.  When Amy, too, vanishes, it's up to Kate to find out what has happened and stop Fitcher's horrible spree.  There's a storm brewing, of course, and the plot goes from atmospherically creepy to nail-biting as the storm rises to fever-pitch.  I could have sworn I heard thunder when I discovered Kate's middle name, when she stood up to him as no one had previously done, when she raced against time to stop him from adding her to his collection.  Does she survive?  Read and see. <br /> <br />Gregory Frost here gives us an unforgettable rendition of one of our darkest fairy tales, a heroine to root for, and a truly terrifying villain.  An added bonus is Terri Windling's introduction.  Her introductions are always a treat, but she's getting even better, as evidenced first by the fascinating one for White as Snow, and now by the essay she wrote for this novel.  She points out, most interestingly, that Perrault's famous version blames Bluebeard's murders on his wives' curiosity and disobedience, but that the older version give us heroines, like Kate, who save themselves by their willingness to question authority and look for answers. <br />	2004-11-18

I was supposed to love this book. <br /> <br />It was recommended to me over and over, based on the sort of books I usually like.  And I did like Katherine--but after being unable to find it for several years, then finally seeing it back in print and grabbing it up on the spot--it didn't live up to my anticipation. <br /> <br />It's a good story--the story of the relationship between John of Gaunt, blood kin to countless kings but never king himself, and his mistress, Katherine Swynford, whom he married after his two royal wives passed away.  Seton fills her book with interesting characters and real-life historical detail. <br /> <br />It's the love story that didn't do it for me.  Yes, John of Gaunt was probably an arrogant jerk in real life.  Supposedly, Seton actually made him less of a jerk than history would indicate--but by gods, if anyone ever proposed to me with the line he used to Katherine, I'd slap him.  Ugh.   This is a good historical novel, yes, but I have trouble thinking it's very romantic.  I just don't much like John, I guess.  Katherine was much better, starting out as a wide-eyed innocent and growing into a competent woman along the way. <br /> <br />I also thought the book was preachy at times in its religious aspects.	2004-11-16

Along the way there are Hand's usual lush fruit-metaphors and insect-metaphors and jewel-metaphors, and as always her prose is an intoxicating fever-dream of a read.    Writing-wise, I think it was probably better than *Waking the Moon*, but I have to admit I liked *Moon* better.  *Moon* had sympathetic, every(wo)man sorts of characters who felt like old friends at first sight.  *Mortal Love* has several characters who could be interesting, but she doesn't spend enough time with any of them to truly show us what makes them tick, and none of them feel as tangible as, say, Sweeney Cassidy.  Still a good book, though, and a wonderful job of using faery material without making it cute or childish in the least, retaining the deadly mystery of the old tales.	2004-11-16

Mostly I was irritated with the three main characters, all of whom are less than sympathetic.  Cornelia is childish and weepy and naive--though she does have the excuse of being fifteen, and of constantly having to make major life decisions even though the people around her are manipulating and deceiving her.  Brutus doesn't have the excuse of being a teenager--he's a brute and a wife-beater and a rapist and a cad, and it never seems to occur to him that perhaps Cornelia would act out less if he either treated her with respect or let her go.  Genvissa is a one-dimensional stock femme fatale.  Between the three of them, they manage to all treat each other like dirt and make me want to throw things at them. <br /> <br />Yet I found myself, months later, still drawn to the story.  So I read it again.  This time, I finished the book, enthralled with the story of the Minotaur and his evil designs, and of these three flawed and very human people trying to oppose him and getting tangled up in their personal agendas along the way.  What's more, Cornelia develops and grows as a character during the course of the book.  Genvissa doesn't change much, and Brutus actually becomes *more* of a jerk, but the series continues into the characters' later incarnations, and perhaps the characters will grow in their future lives. <br /> <br />For now, though, consider me sucked in anyway.  It is with anticipation that I've just begun reading the second book, Gods' Concubine.	2004-11-09
US	49828549	RZKBHUYN7M74U	0061031844	409576673	The Book of Shadows	Books	3	7	9	N	N	Feels unfinished	James Reese attempts Anne-Rice-style supernatural fiction with this, his first novel.  It is Rice-like in that it contains gender-bending sexual material, lush detail, horrifying violence, and a set of supernatural beings who have long existed in folklore but are given new \\"rules\\" and characteristics by the author.  Here, it's witches--but not the sort of harmless neo-pagan witches that are around today.  These are witches as depicted in medieval lore, throwing orgies and dealing with demons.  Some readers had problems with this depiction of witches; I really didn't, since Reese nade no claim to be writing about the sort of witches we are today. <br /> <br />The novel tells the story of Herculine, an orphan whose mother died mysteriously, and who is shunned at the convent that took her in afterwards.  A strange turn of events leads to Herculine's trial for witchcraft.  She is rescued at the last minute by an incubus, a succubus, and a witch named Sebastiana, who takes her in. <br /> <br />Herculine reads Sebastiana's Book of Shadows, her magical diary, and learns more about her kind.  At this point it gets a little weird, as Sebastiana's diary is obviously a modified version of the memoirs of Elizabeth Vigee-Lebrun, real-life court painter to Marie Antoinette.  I don't know why Sebastiana is apparently based heavily on Lebrun, but it's kind of fun, I guess. <br /> <br />But Herculine's idyll at Sebastiana's manor cannot last, as one of her hostess's friends has decided Herculine is an enemy.  She flees, takes on a new identity, and goes on two quests: to find a rite that will allow her succubus friend to die, and to cross the sea to America.  The book ends right after the succubus's ritual, as Herculine is on her way to America.  It's sort of an odd ending, as so much is never resolved. <br /> <br />This book is all right, though there's far too much of Lebrun's diary bogging down the middle of it, and it doesn't seem to go anywhere at the end.  I prefer books thatstand on their own better, even if a series is intended.  Call me weird. <br /> <br />	2004-09-29

It was Kushiel's Avatar, and it was more than a year ago.  This is possibly the best work of fiction I've read this year so far; certainly it's the most unputdownable. <br /> <br />The novel contains two parallel storylines.  One is about Shula, a slave in ancient Sumer, who has visions that lead her to the service of the goddess Inanna.  However, even as Inanna makes greater and greater demands upon her, Shula loses her heart to a different goddess, Belili, Inanna's wilder rival.  And in the modern day, a nerdy girl named Wendy grows up, has a vision of Belili herself, and begins to dream of a life better than her social-outcast existence.  She searches for goddess religion and matriarchy and eventually becomes a scholar of ancient literature, but meanwhile the tension is building in her romantic relationship with her boyfriend Ray.  A weird science-fiction twist brings the two storylines together, and I won't spoil anything else. <br /> <br />But this is a great story, filled with haunting myths and equally haunting depictions of life as a teenage misfit, beautiful scenes of love and friendship, thoughtful discourse about ancient matriarchies and whether they existed, lovely prose, and all sorts of other good stuff.  My only issue with it is that the science fiction device seemed a bit far-fetched to me.  This is a minor quibble--it's science fiction after all!  Read it if you're into mythic fiction or time-travel storylines.	2004-09-15

It features many goddesses from around the world.  Each goddess's section includes a brief look at her history, an invocation to her, a meditation to help you get in touch with her, and finally a beautifully written ritual to bring her influence into your life.  For example, Venus's ritual attracts love, while Hecate's brings justice against wrongdoers, and Oshun's accentuates your beauty.  Each section includes poetry written by Sophia, obviously well-researched, because it is wholly new but uses the phrases and general style of each goddess's ancient hymns.<br /><br />The best comparison I can come up with for this book is that it reminds me of Kala Trobe's \\"Invoke the Goddess\\", except that Sophia's book is more verbal while Trobe's is more visual.<br /><br />Quite good.  You'll be copying huge chunks of it into your BOS.	2004-09-13

It could have been great--it could have dealt with double goddesses such as Demeter/Persephone, Isis/Nephthys, and Inanna/Ereshkigal.  And at first, that's what it seems to be.  Noble draws on Jungian ideas and talks about the \\"bright\\" ovulatory half of women's cycles, and also the \\"dark\\" menstrual side of the cycle, and how this relates to double goddesses where one governs life and the other death.  So far, so good.<br />But Noble strays too far from the facts and wanders into pseudohistory and fanaticism.  She uses statues of paired women from prehistoric times, and sometimes even statues of paired androgynous figures, to \\"prove\\" that all societies in prehistoric times were ruled by Dual Queens, one presiding over war and the other over spirituality and peace.  She also posits that this should be the case again, with all peoples ruled by Dual Queens, and males reduced to something like breeding stock.<br />I seem to remember, in her earlier book Motherpeace, that the Emperor and the Hierophant were presented as negative images, and that the Emperor and Hierophant were like \\"Dual Kings\\" of patriarchal society, ruling respectively over war and religion.   And these men oppressed women, forbidding them any important place in the world, and treated them as nothing but baby-makers.  How is is any better if it's women doing the sexist oppression?<br />This book isn't doing me any favors as a feminist or as a pagan.  I don't want women to trample all over men.  I want equality.  And I think I speak for the majority.	2004-07-08

Byatt's Possession and Mythology	Books	4	18	19	N	N	(3.5) Fascinating book about the myth of Melusine	This book presents itself as a scholarly look at the figure of Melusine, best-known as the mysterious heroine of a medieval French fairy tale, but with ties to major goddesses of the ancient world.  The author focuses mainly on Melusine's story as presented in A.S. Byatt's novel _Possession_, but also ties in earlier versions of the tale and other modern novelizations.  <br />Alban's thesis is that Melusine is a survival of the ancient Great Goddess.  This book is at its best when comparing Melusine to various ancient goddesses.  For example, Alban's comparison of Melusine and Medusa, both snake-ladies whom one could not gaze upon with impunity, is fascinating.  Also mentioned is Melusine's similarity to Echidna, who like Melusine was a bearer of strange reptilian children.  Alban also studies the figures of Eve, Lilith, Persephone, and many others.  It's jaw-dropping, at least to a reader like me who is obsessed with the Melusine story, how many parallels there really are between her tale and the older myths.  <br />The downfall of this book is its unquestioning embrace of the &quot;prehistoric matriarchy&quot; theory.  No one really knows whether people in ancient times were peaceful, feminist, &quot;gylanic&quot; tribes worshipping a single Great Mother.  The theory has not been disproven; however, it is far from proven.  No one really knows.  But I think this book would have come across as more scholarly if it had presented the matriarchy ideas as theory and not as fact.	2004-07-08

It's an eyes-glued-to-the-page story of politics and war between three realms in a world not unlike Dark Ages Britain or Ireland.  The silver caul that once held the Sidhe, the goblins, and the humans in their own little worlds is missing; now the three races are thrown back together for reasons unknown, and chaos ensues.  The story focuses around several young women struggling to survive in this chaotic situation.  I loved it--it's rare that a book about political intrigue really does surprise me and pull the rug out from under my feet.  You don't know who to trust.  A character can be presented as very sympathetic and then turn out to be otherwise--and vice versa.  Few authors can really fool the reader like that.  Anne Kelleher can.<br />I just wish I'd known this was a series!  Yeah, I know everything has to be a trilogy these days, but I didn't know Silver's Edge wasn't a standalone!

She does this so wonderfully that I wish I'd had this book two years ago.  Reading this book was like reading the story of the past few years of my own life--and as much as the &quot;treasure hunt&quot; for challenging material has helped me grow, it was validating to find that others were on the same search.<br />This book covers where to find books that aid your path in places other than the New Age/Metaphysical shelf; ideas for gaining a rapport with Nature; one of the most thoughtful chapters I've ever read about how to get closer to your deities; and an examination of different &quot;specializations&quot; one can choose.  I saw myself in the &quot;Scribe&quot; archetype; could you be a &quot;Bard&quot; or a &quot;Healer&quot;?  <br />You're not going to find spells or rituals here, but if you've been a pagan for a few years and want to know how to keep yourself on your toes, don't hesitate to buy this book.

Rosemary Hawley Jarman does a wonderful job of bringing this fascinating figure to life, even though all but the barest facts about her are lost to history.<br />Jarman's Elizabeth is, at the beginning of the novel, an ordinary noble teenager of her times; sweet, passionate, but hot-headed.  But when her first husband, whom she married for love, is killed in battle, she vows revenge and hardens her heart.  With the help of her mother and Melusine, the ancestral spirit who haunts her family, Elizabeth brews up a plot to enchant the King of England and make her family the most powerful in the country.  But her reign is cut short by the violent years of the Wars of the Roses, and suddenly Elizabeth is playing for her very survival.  Intertwined with her story is that of King Edward's illegitimate daughter, Grace, who adores the icy Queen Elizabeth but loves one of her greatest enemies.<br />This novel is a vivid depiction of the turbulent era of the Wars of the Roses.  The writing is beautiful and descriptive, and I especially loved the little dash of the supernatural that Jarman adds to her brew.  That said, I did have a little bit of trouble sticking to the course with this book, since it is very much a downer!  Most of the characters are utterly unsympathetic (except Elizabeth as a young girl, and Grace who is sweet but a complete doormat most of the time), and almost nothing happy occurs in the entire book.  This is NOT Jarman's fault--these were terrible times that brought out the worst in almost everybody--but it does make for a story that is often painful to read.	2004-01-27

The cover of this book seems to indicate that _The Elements of Ritual_ is merely a book about the four elements--air, earth, fire, and water--but it turns out to be so much more.  The author uses the four elements in a metaphorical way, analyzing what goes on during each part of a Wiccan ritual from the practical point of view (earth), the intellectual (air), the mystical (fire), and the mythological and emotional (water).  She dissects the entire ritual, from the pre-ritual preparations to the closing of the circle, from these four points of view.  For example, when she gets to the part where the gods are invoked, she talks about gods--what are they anyway?--from all four angles.  It's very interesting stuff, and makes a lot of sense.<br />She uses her analysis to form opinions about some of the controversies in the Wiccan community.  Wiccans are forever arguing about things like when the Cakes and Wine should be done--mid-ritual? afterward for grounding?  Lipp has definite opinions about how things should be done, and while you don't have to agree with everything she says, at least it's refreshing to see someone actually say &quot;This is the way to do it&quot; so that you can *choose* to agree or disagree, rather than floundering about in a sea of &quot;do whatever you want&quot; books that leave everybody confused.  All of her opinions are backed up by sound arguments.  I wish I'd had this book several years ago, when I was just getting into the Craft.  With all those contradictory books on the market, how does one know whether one is picking up bad ritual habits that at best waste energy, and at worst anger the gods?  I'm glad to see someone take stands and back them up.<br />This is being touted as an intermediate book.  I think that's true, in that most Wiccans who've been around a while could still learn something from this book.  I know I did.  However, don't let that scare you off if you're a beginner!  This insightful guide might help you make sense of some of the more confusing books out there.  I'd love it if everyone who wrote about Wicca had opinions as considered as Lipp's.	2003-07-21

I agree with the reviewer below who says this shouldn't be your first book.  It would indeed be confusing if you had no background in the Craft, since it's not written in a narrative, read-from-beginning-to-end style.  It's more like an encyclopedia or cookbook, and jumps from topic to topic with little fanfare or segue.  This works pretty well, since if you're a beginner you can find fairly basic stuff easily, and if you've been around a while you can skip ahead to the new stuff.  <br />This book contains such things as extensive correspondence tables, spells and chants (well-written, poetry-wise), and advice on various sorts of situations.  I was personally pleased to see a section on the Moon Mansions, since they're a particular fascination of mine, and there's not much information about them readily available.  I think that's what most people will get from this book--a few treasures that happen to be what they were looking for.  Like I mentioned in the title of my review, there's something for everyone.<br />I will concur with other reviewers--this book is mostly written for the teen witch.  You don't have to be a teen to read it, but RavenWolf touches on a lot of subjects that are of concern to teens, and helps them find a sense of personal empowerment.   She's been criticized for talking down to teens, but I didn't really sense that in this particular book.  She's also been criticized for encouraging teens to question authority, but as she says, there are adults out there who don't have teens' best interests at heart!  Abusive parents and teachers, sad to say, are out there, and to exhort teens to blindly accept whatever they say is more condescending than RavenWolf's books.  And even a teen whose parents and teachers are caring is going through a time when it's natural to question authority.  It's part of the process of growing up and forming one's own opinions.  Yes, adults can legally control teens' actions, but I don't believe that a teen has to eradicate even rebellious *thoughts* from her/his mind.  (This is in response to criticism of RavenWolf's earlier books--she was blasted for saying a teen could be Pagan even if his or her parents disapproved.)<br />I do have two gripes:<BR>(1) She criticizes the village &quot;cunning folk&quot; of the past for using the practices of witchcraft without the religion, and even implies that they brought on the witch persecutions.  This is not true.  These &quot;cunning folk&quot; lived in a time when there was little surviving pagan lore or belief, and of course they would have used only fragments of the old religion, if they used any pagan lore at all.   And the witch persecutions were not about paganism, they were about politics and money.  The people who were killed were not killed for being pagan, they were killed for being unpopular.<BR>(2) A less serious issue, but still irked me--Acne is *not* caused by being dirty!  RavenWolf implies that teens who have acne probably have it because they are too lazy to wash their faces.  In fact, acne is usually caused by hormonal imbalances, especially an excess of testosterone.  Who do you think steroid users break out?  And why do girls break out during PMS?  Testosterone levels are out of whack.  If a teenager who washes her face twice a day but still has zits reads _Solitary Witch_, she may come to believe she's not clean enough--and over-washing the face can actually irritate it and lead to more blemishes.	2003-07-21

The thought-provoking \\"Sorceress's Tale\\" series concludes, as far as I know, with this book. The sorceress Pierrette, seventeen years old in body and ancient in spirit, still dreams of the day when she will finally meet her dream-lover, Minho of the Fortunate Isles, and become his queen. But the goddess Ma throws a wrench in her plans when she insists that Pierrette must kill Minho and destroy the Fortunate Isles. Pierrette is heartbroken, and doesn't know why this must be.<br /><br />Soon after, she is reunited with the scientist ibn Saul and his apprentice Lovi, still beautiful, still conflicted about his sexuality. Ibn Saul is also on a mission to find the Fortunate Isles. Pierrette now believes she understands Ma's demand--if ibn Saul finds the Isles, he may rationalize them into something wholly mundane. And so maybe she has to destroy them before ibn Saul can ruin them. Hoping she can find a less extreme solution than the Lady's, Pierrette joins them on their journey.<br /><br />From here, the story goes fairly slowly for a while, bogged down in travel minutiae. But hints begin to appear that something is terribly wrong somewhere--that the balance of good and evil in the world is messed up yet again, threatening to unleash the terrible Black Time.<br /><br />The plot picks up when Pierrette actually reaches the Fortunate Isles. What sort of place is this, and what sort of man is Minho? And how is Minho's utopia connected with the Black Time? Once Pierrette is in Minho's kingdom, _The Isle Beyond Time_ becomes quite exciting, recalling both the thoughtfulness of _The Sacred Pool_ and the action of _The Veil of Years_. I won't say anything more, since I don't want to spoil the plot twists for you.<br /><br />This is an interesting end to the trilogy. I wonder what Pierrette will do with the rest of her life--after all, she is quite young in physical years.<br /><br />Edit: The more I think about it, the more uneasy I am with the way Lovi's sexuality is dealt with in this book. There's something here that tastes of homophobia, though I'm not sure I can say what's bothering me without spoiling the plot. Let's just say I disagree with Douglas about how sexual orientation is determined.hat tastes of homophobia, though I'm not sure I can say what's bothering me without spoiling the plot.

Her focus here is Ireland, and its goddesses, whose myths are intimately connected with the landscape.  After all, the country itself *is* named after a goddess...Monaghan traveled to Ireland for the first time in her early adulthood, in search of her Irish roots.  She was so moved by the experience that she has returned many times.  And in this book, she takes us on a \\"tour\\" of what she has experienced in her journeys.  We travel vicariously to the rock said to be the Cailleach, the field where Macha ran, Medb's burial mound, and the shrine of Brigid at Kildare, where the sacred fire has recently been lit again.     But lest you think this is just fluff, Monaghan does not ignore the bad stuff either.  Woven together with her beautiful spiritual experiences and warm friendships are the dark threads of the Troubles, the potato famine, and the English invasion, which forever haunt Ireland.  And also, there are the personal tragedies.  Some of Monaghan's friends have died over the years, ahd she pays them tribute here.  The result is a book by turns uplifting, melancholy, and sometimes riotously funny, but always emotionally moving.  Read this book if you are interested in Ireland--a land which, like the Cailleach, has survived against the odds.	2003-03-30

Susan Wittig Albert's China Bayles series has had its high points, as well as low points where several books in a row seemed to have the same plot, and where the murderer always seemed to be that one character who didn't have any real reason to be in the book *unless* s/he was the culprit.  With _Bloodroot_, Albert rises above a few blah-ish books midseries, and proves she is a unique talent in the mystery field.  <br />China is summoned by her mother to the family's old plantation, where her ailing Aunt Tullie is in trouble.  See, Aunt Tullie was the last to see an old childhood playmate of China's, who claimed to have a deed to the plantation and now is missing.   She had motive, means, and opportunity.  And unless China can figure out what's going on, her ailing aunt may go to jail.  <br />Haunted by a recurring dream from her childhood, and assisted by the ghost of a suicidal ancestress, China uncovers dark secrets in her family's past, from slavery and ill-treatment of Native Americans to hereditary diseases, illegitimate pregnancies, and murder.  Albert paints an enthralling picture of her setting, showing both its beauty and its decadence.  And I love these touches of \\"magical realism\\" she uses from time to time.  As an added bonus, I had no clue whodunit until very close to the end!	2003-03-24
US	49828549	R1CUOGUKKMW23Q	1842930583	164691655	Warriors of the Wasteland: A Quest for the Pagan Sacrificial Cult behind the Grail Legends	Books	5	16	16	N	N	The Celtic Mysteries	Many years ago, W.Y. Evans-Wentz theorized that the ancient Celts may have held mystery rites, similar to those of the Greek Eleusis, in which they made a visionary journey to the lands of the dead.  John Grigsby's fascinating book, to me, is the fulfillment of that theory.  With archaeological and mythological evidence in abundance, Grigsby puts together a theory of what such mysteries might have been like.<br />He begins by wondering why the Celts practiced occasional human sacrifice.  This is often a divisive issue.  There are two general ideas about Celtic human sacrifice.  One is that the Celtic lands were drenched in sacrificial blood and lit constantly by the fires of burning wicker cages full of unwilling victims.  The other is that the Celts were peaceful tree-huggers who wouldn't hurt a fly.  It's most likely that the truth is in the middle, and it's this middle road that Grigsby takes.  His theory is that *in general* Druidic rituals involved either metaphorical deaths a la Eleusis, or animal sacrifice, but occasionally when severe problems cropped up, a human being consented to be a \\"bridge\\" between the living and the dead.  To die, basically, so that his people could call his spirit back and ask it questions about what it had seen on the other side.<br />He gathers evidence from anywhere he can get it.  The victims were sometimes painted green--so he goes to the myths and looks at the Green Knight story.  They often had traces of the poisonous, hallucinogenic fungus ergot in their stomachs--so he makes comparisons to the Greek mysteries, where ergot in small doses may have facilitated the visions seen by the initiates.  He looks at the stoneworks of the earlier peoples of Britain, since they may have been related to an earlier form of the cult.  What emerges is a tantalizing speculation about Celtic/Druidic religion.  I couldn't put it down--Grigsby has enough hard evidence to appeal to my left brain but also has the gift of interesting prose, to satisfy the right half.  If Robert Graves had made coherent sense, he might have written this book.	2003-03-20

This reviewer has cut-and-pasted that review, verbatim, under all of the books in the Sabbat Series.  Given that I've read several of them which don't fit the &quot;Lite&quot; description, I am surmising that the reviewer read maybe one of the books and made a generalization about all of them.  Bear in mind that they are written by different authors, with varying degrees of knowledge and writing skills.   <br />Anna Franklin and Paul Mason do a great job here with the fragmentary material they have to work with.  Lammas/Lughnasad is possibly the most obscure of the Wiccan holidays, both because little survives about it and because the sometimes uncomfortable theme of sacrifice is present in it.   The authors piece together what information remains to us about the deity for whom Lughnasad is named--Irish Lugh, Welsh Llew--and about the ways they were honored.  Since this isn't a huge body of information, they supplement it with material about other sacrificial gods whose rites occurred around this time of year, such as Odin, Adonis, and Dionysos.  They add in some of Robert Graves's evocative speculations about sacrificial kings, and together all this stuff will give you a good starting point for your Lammas rituals.<br />There are also recipes, incenses, spells, dyes, etc.  Additionally, there is a large section on warrior magic, since Lugh was a warrior and Lughnasad is often considered a time to honor these fierce energies.  This section almost could have been another book, dealing with things such as totem animals.<br />The book concludes with several rituals for the season, each with a different cultural slant (Druidic, Norse, general Wiccan, etc.)  The rituals are relatively simple as written, which I like, since it means I can use them as a framework and flesh them out with my own writing and ideas.<br />Overall, a valuable book about an obscure holiday.<br />*--A chant I made up.	2003-03-17

This book is widely criticized; it seems that it has hit a nerve with some Pagans who believe, or want to believe, that Gerald Gardner revealed to the public a religion which had survived in secret since the Stone Age.  (The other night I attended a Pagan gathering, at which a locally respected elder insisted, angrily, that the Druids were practicing recognizable Wicca in the stoneworks of Newgrange.)   <br />However, this book dispelled a completely opposite illusion from my mind.  I had long suspected that Gerald Gardner had been a \\"dirty old man\\",  who used a cursory knowledge of ceremonial magic to create a religion whose sole purpose was to get young women to disrobe for him.  And that it took the timely arrival of Doreen Valiente to turn Wicca into an actual religion rather than just Gardner's personal fetish party.  Hutton bursts that bubble as neatly as he bursts the \\"ancient survival\\" theorists' bubble.  I came away from this book with respect for both Gardner and Valiente, as well as several other prominent early Wiccans, and even a bit of bemused affection for Aleister Crowley.<br />Hutton shows that Gardner wasn't passing on an ancient tradition, but also that he wasn't just making it up out of nowhere.  He traces Wicca's roots back to Romantic literature (no wonder I like paganism! I love the poetry), Masonry, cunning craft, ceremonial magic, spiritualism, and other fields.  At the time Wicca was presented to the public, certain factors made it precisely what made sense in the culture of the times.  From there, Hutton follows Wicca to the present day, and the forces of politics and psychology that have resulted in the Wicca we see today.  (And he even mentions Rae Beth, my favorite but somewhat obscure 101 author.)   <br />Through all of this history runs a current that I don't think I'm imagining.  I could be wrong, but I feel that between the lines of this scholarly, intellectual text is a deep interest and fascination with Wicca.  I can almost see, in some places, where the author's enthusiasm almost breaks through the cool, collected prose.  To those who say Hutton is hostile toward Wicca, I think you've missed that undercurrent.  It bears mentioning that Hutton took flak in the scholarly community for his sympathy toward the Wiccan religion.<br />This is a mature, intelligent book about the origins and history of Wicca, and I believe it marks a rite of passage for the religion as a whole.  This is, finally, a book we can hand to our curious friends, and say, \\"This is where I'm coming from, this is what we're about\\", without embarrassment.  This book made me more proud to be a Pagan than I've been in a long time.	2003-03-17

How about Cinderella?  If Robert Graves got hold of that story, he'd say something like this: \\"Cinderella's name means Ash-lady, which denotes her as the ash-pale Death-goddess of winter.  She and her two stepsisters form the classic Triple Goddess.  Originally, the sisters' names were probably Destruction and Pestilence.  Cinderella's transformation at the hands of the Fairy Godmother was really a late patriarchal addition; no doubt the original goddess transformed herself, showing her Love-goddess face rather than her more spectral one.  Her dance with the Prince is an example of the White Goddess's choice of the King of the Waxing Year as her consort.  In the version that has come down to us, she loses her shoe, but certainly in the uncorrupted, original myth, it was the Prince who lost his shoe, as the sacrificial king was often marked by a limp.  This can be seen in the Welsh story of Math ap Mathonwy, and Dionysos's epithets also hinted at lameness.  At the hour of midnight, that is to say, the witching hour, Cinderella reveals her terrible, ravening face by turning back into the ragged Death-goddess.  Undoubtedly, the story ended with Cinderella's murder of the Prince, and her mourning for him by painting her face with the ashes of his funeral pyre, as the Welsh women mourned for Llew Llaw Gyffes.  The happy ending we are familiar with is actually the record of the patriarchal takeover, when the White Goddess was forcibly married to the Year-King who had become the supreme god of the new mythology.\\"  Hey, that was fun!<br />Graves wrote in a poem once, \\"There is one story and one story only.\\"  This story is the myth of the White Goddess, beautiful and faithless, seducing her consort and then betraying him to death at the hands of his rival for her love.  This is the only story Graves can see, and everything in this book is filtered through \\"White-Goddess\\"-colored glasses.  Every myth in which a malefigure dies is a record of human sacrifice to the Goddess.  Every female figure is assumed to be triple, whether the myths show her in triple form or not.  And he always chooses the bloodiest interpretation possible.  For example, whenever the root \\"Perse\\" appears in a name, he insists it should really be \\"Pterse\\", \\"destruction\\".  He is so caught up in his morbid mythos that he doesn't realize it might just really be \\"Perse\\", which means \\"light\\".   So, certainly don't take this book as gospel.  It is colored by the biases and assumptions of its author, and should definitely not be the only book you read on the subject of Greek mythology.<br />That said, I was fascinated by _The Greek Myths_.  I had trouble following his _White Goddess_, but this book is more structured and easier to keep up with.  And it gave me some tantalizing ideas for my neo-pagan practice.  Just because the history may be dubious doesn't mean this book can't be inspirational--as long as one remembers that the theories came from Graves and not from the ancients.	2003-03-12

And, specifically, rhythm was prevalent in the ancient Goddess religions of the Mediterranean.  I never realized, until I read _When the Drummers Were Women_, how many of the Goddess traditions included sacred drumming.  But it's right there--Cybele's devotees ate and drank from drums and cymbals, Inanna was given drum music as an offering, and votive figures of drumming women have been found in many places.  It's like what I've heard happens when a woman gets pregnant--all of a sudden, she sees pregnant women everywhere.  Not because there are more pregnant women than there were before, but because her focus has changed.  Layne Redmond gives us a new focus--percussion--and suddenly we're able to see the pattern of rhythmic ecstasy that ran through many of these rituals, which many of us hadn't noticed before.  And she also suggests drumming as a way to the divine today, and emphasizes that drums were not always seen as &quot;masculine&quot; instruments as they are seen today.  Are they seen as masculine?  Ask me, ask any woman who played percussion as a young girl.  A lot of weird looks still follow a female drummer.  But that's changing, thanks to prominent female drummers like Redmond.<br />Why not five stars?  I think it's a personal issue of mine.  I've read a lot of &quot;history of the Goddess&quot; books in my life, and at this point I'm heartily sick of reading about the matriarchy and its suppression by the patriarchy.   This isn't Redmond's fault, it's mine.  But this book contains the exact same story arc I've seen many times before, the very same oversimplified history.  (The best three-dimensional account I've seen of this theme is Baring and Cashford's _The Myth of the Goddess.  Other writers' tellings of this story come off as too sweepingly general after theBaring/Cashford book.)  It's up to you whether the drumming angle justifies buying another book about the matriarchy/patriarchy story.   For me, it was justified, because I am interested in Demeter, Persephone, and Dionysos, and got some new information about their rites from Redmond's book.  It's the big question to ask yourself before buying this book.	2003-03-08
US	49828549	R3HGHDVZ8ZMT2T	0374504938	459059688	The White Goddess: A Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth, Amended and Enlarged Edition	Books	3	60	69	N	N	Badb's Cauldron, and Other Digressions	Robert Graves believed that all \\"true\\" poetry was inspired by, and dedicated to, the White Goddess (or to a woman embodying her attributes)--a \\"Belle Dame sans Merci\\"--who brought ecstasy, madness, and death to her chosen lovers.  In this vein, he wrote this book, which has become the basis of much neo-pagan philosophy.  The Maiden/Mother/Crone triplicity can be traced to _The White Goddess_, as can the Oak and Holly Kings, and the meanings usually ascribed to the letters of the Gaelic Ogham alphabet.  TWG cannot be underestimated as a source for pagan theology; it has been the inspiration for a lot of wonderful material.  The most puzzling thing, though, is how anyone managed to make enough sense of TWG to glean meaning from it.  This book confused the living daylights out of me, and I was glad, paradoxically, that I had read many of the later books that draw upon TWG before I actually read TWG.  Otherwise, I might have been hopelessly lost in these pages.  Now, there are those who will call me unintellectual for this admission.  But for pete's sake, I can follow Carl Kerenyi's mythological meanderings, and he doesn't use smaller words than Graves.  What he does do, though, is use segues when moving from one subject to another, and distinguish clearly between known fact, conjecture, and sheer flight of fancy.  And includes, for crying out loud, a bibliography!<br />Graves's basic premise is that the \\"Tuatha De Danaan\\" of the British Isles were really displaced Greeks, who encoded within their mystical alphabet secret lore from Greek and Hebrew mythology.   The code in its entirety supposedly adds up to a poem about the Goddess.  But as interesting as I find Graves's ideas, his text is sometimes impossible to fathom.  He has a bad case of literary ADD.  He'll start examining something in Welsh myth, for example, and if he can't find the evidence he wants in Welsh material, he'll fire up his warp drive and zoom off to Greece or Phoenicia or Israel, often leaving thereader behind in a cloud of dust and wondering what on earth just happened.  Or, if he can't find a source for his ideas _anywhere_, he'll look at an existing source and say it must be corrupted by the patriarchy and _should_ say something else entirely.  And he tends to state wild guesses with the same certainty accorded to historical facts.  Since he doesn't have a bibliography, I can't look and see which of his statements came from his source material and which from his imagination.  I don't think I have a hope of truly grokking this book until, at some point in the nebulous and improbable future, I become as well-read as the author himself.  <br />I am glad I read this book, especially since it showed me where many modern pagan authors got their ideas.  (For example, now I know why neo-pagan writers talk of Badb's cauldron, though it never seems to be mentioned in primary sources...it's because Graves translates \\"Badb\\" as \\"boiling\\" and conjectures that the name refers to the cauldron of Cerridwen and/or Bran.  I also know now how Cerridwen's cauldron first became conflated with Bran's.)   But it still fried my brain.  I don't see myself throwing this book out or anything--what is more likely is that it'll become the \\"annotated edition\\", and that I'll stuff notes between the pages every time I read something that makes more sense out of Graves's ramblings.  Worth reading, but don't feel dumb if you have trouble following it.	2003-03-06

Let me tell you, I love the way that man's mind worked.  In the case of Eleusis, and also in the case of Dionysos, there are secrets that the celebrants of the rites took to their graves.  But rather than just say \\"we'll never know what really went on\\", Kerenyi leaves no stone unturned in an attempt to figure it out.  Using myths, art, and \\"urban legends\\" from ancient times, which often dance around secret subjects, Kerenyi puts together a more coherent picture of the religions of these ancient deities.  The myths and art may dance around the real mysteries, but if you \\"dance\\" around enough and see the material from enough different angles, you can get a pretty good idea of what isn't being said.  <br />Dionysos originated on the island of Crete, where he was considered to be the same deity as Zeus, and was a dying and resurrected god who presided over mead and the mysteries of death and rebirth.  From there, his cult was taken all over the Mediterranean world, and changed along the way.  His rites changed, too, and Kerenyi shows us all of the different ways he was worshipped, from the bull-sacrifice on Crete (with a great chapter on the god's notorious wife Ariadne) to the roving maenads of rural Greece, to the sacred tragedies and comedies of classical Athens.  Then we see Dionysos again on the walls of the Villa dei Misteri in Pompeii.  <br />In a way, _Dionysos_ is differently focused than _Eleusis_, where the author was trying to reconstruct what happened on one particular night.   This book is more protean, following the thread of the Dionysus cult throughout distance and time as it changes.  Recommended to anyone who loves mythology.	2003-02-26

This is, bar none, the best book I've seen yet about the goddess religions of the ancient world.  It has its limitations--it mainly covers Europe and the Middle East--but it is amazingly thorough on the stuff it does cover.<br />Many goddess books have the weakness of bad scholarship--they believe that the world used to be a certain way just because someone else told them so, or because they wish it was so.  This is not one of them.  To give you an example, an issue often in contention between goddess-folks and other researchers is, were the \\"Venus figurines\\" really meant to represent goddesses?  Usually, authors either dismiss those statues as pornography, or else laugh off the suggestion that they are pornography with equal disdain.  Baring and Cashford tackle the issue head-on, eventually deciding the figures are not simply pornographic based on their abstractness.  Writing about prehistory always requires some speculation, but this book is a breath of fresh air in that it provides arguments and evidence every time the authors must make a leap of faith.<br />Baring and Cashford begin there, with the statues of matronly women found in European caves, and trace the transmission of the archetype of the goddess from prehistory to the twentieth century.  Each culture was influenced by those before it and near it, and the stories and images they honored can be used as a map of changes in human consciousness.  The goddess in ancient times was seen as the spirit of the natural world; as humans began to distance themselves from the natural world, the goddess became seen as a symbol of \\"mere\\" physicality and the god as the \\"higher\\" symbol of spirit.  Finally we get the image of Eve, the first sinner, who carries all the ancient goddess symbols for political reasons--the leaders of the time were trying to distance Judaism from the polytheistic traditions of their neighbors.  But this image was blown out of proportion--taken as literal history, the story of Eve was used to denigrate the goddess, human women, sex, and nature all at once.   <br />Beautifully written, scholarly, and insightful, this is a very good book about the goddess archetype--and doesn't even fall into the common pitfall of assuming that all human women can be defined by this archetype.  This is the kind of book that is good for the goddess movement, rather than embarrassing.	2003-02-23

She lectures the reader about how we ought to be going more deeply into the religion than the gazillions of 101 books on the market.  And I agree.<br />Here's the problem.  The Wiccans who are only on the path because it's trendy aren't going to read this book.  They'll toss it aside after a few pages.  So will sincere newcomers to the Craft, once they realize the book doesn't provide much practical guidance for &quot;going deeper&quot;, just a rant about how we should do so.  The only people who are going to read this book from cover to cover are the people who agree with most of Reed's ideas.   In retrospect, I think this book is just a feel-good book, allowing people who agree with Reed to pat themselves on the back for being better than Those Other Wiccans.  And I reiterate, I agree with her points often.  But after I read the book, I felt guilty for agreeing; I felt like I'd been caught acting elitist and stuck-up.<br />Don't worry, Ms. Reed--the kids who are only in Wicca because it's &quot;cool&quot; will leave as soon as something else becomes the rage--or maybe they'll stay and learn something.  That's what happens to most of us.  We start out as newbies in the Craft, often for the wrong reasons, and either move on or else go deeper into the religion and grow closer to the Gods.  We've been doing it for years without this book to shame us into doing it.  This book has one of two purposes--either it is written to shame newbies into practicing Wicca Reed's way, or else it is written as a bit of self-congratulation.  Neither one seems healthy to me.  We're not going to grow, spiritually, by getting smug about how far we've already come.	2003-02-21

This book is gorgeous enough to be a coffee-table ornament, and substantial enough that it'll spend more time in your hands than on the coffee table.<br />Many of the goddesses worshipped in ancient times were envisioned in the form of animals, or depicted with animals, such as the snake, cow, bird, or sow.  Buffie Johnson writes lucidly about these goddesses and supplements her work with TONS of pictures.  She touches on many different cultures, from the Mediterranean to Scotland and South America.  If you're interested in goddess spirituality, you will definitely want this book.  <br />A side note:  I really wish I'd had this on hand when I read _The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory_ a few weeks ago.  In that book Cynthia Eller tries to disprove matriarchies, and among other things, questions the theory that there was goddess worship in Crete.  She says that the two \\"Snake Goddess\\" statues don't necessarily prove anything.  No, not by themselves.  But from Johnson's book, I learned that there were similar but less elaborate statues on altars in people's houses...that a beautifully painted sarcophagus bore a mural of a host of priestesses performing a bull-sacrifice as a lone male flutist trilled in the background...that there were far more images of female power in the \\"seal stones\\" than I had seen before.  Or that the smaller of the Snake Goddesses wears a rose crown, the sign of Ariadne, though I don't know if they're connected.  I still don't know whether there was a matriarchy there, or whether it would have been a good or bad thing if there had been one.  But Johnson has convinced me that there were goddesses worshipped there.<br />This book does occasionally go a little bit overboard, seeing goddess symbolism where there may be no symbolism at all.  But in general, it is a beautiful and useful resource that will delight anyone interested in the ancient Ladies.	2003-02-15

I especially liked the fact that Waldherr made Persephone smart rather than passive, thinking up the solution by which she could please both mother and husband.  And, like I said, it's relatively gently told.  The scene where Hades's chariot bursts up from the earth is a little scary-looking, but Hades turns out to not be a bad guy in the end.

It's not hard to see why--it's chock-full of spells for every occasion, plus lots of useful correspondences and witty modern attitude.  When I was a newbie, I learned to write my own spells in part by modeling them after spells in this book.<br />The only real problem I have with it is what is sometimes called &quot;Plug and Pray&quot;.  I'll tell you up front, I'm not a Wiccan, I'm a polytheist.  I don't really like the way Morrison inserts god names almost at random, or just for the sake of the rhyme scheme, into these spells.  Sometimes I have no clue why she picked the deity that she did.  Adding to my frustration is a huge appendix listing other gods you can &quot;use&quot; for the spells, listed under their areas of expertise.  The god names are followed by a (M) or (F) denoting gender.  Personally, I believe that if you don't even know what gender a deity is, you shouldn't go invoking her or him until you do a little more research.  Those who believe that all the gods are just facets of one God and one Goddess might not have this problem.  But I do, and so I can't give _Everyday Magic_ five stars.  I just don't think it's quite respectful to call on deities you've barely heard of in order to work a spell.	2003-02-15

But trust me, it is more than that.  Francesca Stanfill sets her novel apart with lush and dreamy prose, and with the literature of Shakespeare, which underlies the entire plot.<br />Elisabeth Rowan is a thirtyish writer, alone in the world except for her married lover, who is irresistible despite being nothing but trouble for Elisabeth.  She receives an odd commission--to write the biography of stage actress Joanna Eakins, as requested by Joanna on her deathbed.  Why did this famous woman choose Elisabeth?  And what mysteries lurk within Joanna's glamorous life?  The answer is to be found in Shakespeare's plays, and in a mysterious maze where Joanna placed statues of the Bard's heroines.  Along the way, Elisabeth finds her backbone and a very different sort of love.  Sort of Barbara Michaels-ish in a way, this is an addictive novel.	2003-02-06

Laurell Hamilton promises a story of modern-day faeries and their complex court intrigue, which in theory is right up my alley, but I didn't really get into it.<br />I agree with a previous reviewer who complains that \\"every developing scene is a sex scene\\".  By about page 100, my significant other was laughing because I kept yelling aloud, \\"Is she going to sleep with HIM TOO?\\"  The entire plot of the book seems to consist of Merry's sexual adventures.  That would be OK if it were good erotica, but there is far too much gory violence to sustain the sexy mood.  To sum up the book: Sex scene, gore scene, sex scene, gory sex scene...well, you get the picture.<br />For urban faerie adventures with more plot, try Charles de Lint (Jack of Kinrowan), Emma Bull (War for the Oaks), James A. Hetley (The Summer Country), Diana Wynne Jones (Fire and Hemlock), or Nancy Springer (Fair Peril).	2003-02-06

You know the one.  Everybody lived in perfect peace and harmony, worshipping the Goddess, until the Big Bad Patriarchal Invaders swept in and ruined everything.  Cynthia Eller isn't afraid to ask the questions that seem to get swept under the rug by this theory, for example:  Where is the evidence for this matriarchy?  How did the Big Bad Invaders become patriarchal themselves?  Is the idea of a feminine utopia sexist?  And why (I'm glad I'm not the only one who has had this question) does everyone think the Venus of Willendorf looks pregnant?<br />Eller shows that there is little evidence for an ancient matriarchy.  There isn't much evidence against it, either; very little decipherable record remains.  Goddess-interested researchers tend to see Goddess symbols everywhere.  A straight line represents the Goddess.  So does a wavy one.  (I suppose my own propensity to doodle spiderwebs in the corners of my papers means I'm invoking Arachne every time I make my grocery list.)   Eller shows these excesses for what they are, and shows that there is very little proof of the matriarchy theory.<br />Even more interesting than this, though, is Eller's spotlight on the ideas behind this proposed utopia.  Matriarchalists seem to believe that women, merely by virtue of being women, have certain personality traits such as compassion, cooperation, nurturance, pacifism, and a greater connection to emotions and intuition than to logic.  And if women ran the world, society would reflect these traits.  Eller notices, though many other writers do not, that these \\"feminine\\" traits are the same ones ascribed to women in medieval times, or in the Victorian age.  Traits that have been used to bring women down.  Is it really \\"feminist\\" to limit oneself to an archetypal \\"good mother\\" role that has been forced on us since antiquity?  <br />Eller instead envisions a society where neither women nor menare exalted simply for being women or men.  A society where the sexes are treated equally.  Hopefully we can continue striving for this.	2003-02-06

I don't know what she's like in real life, but she comes off as a preachy, More-Psychic-than-Thou pain in the neck.  She is, of course, destined to be a Voodoo Chief, due to manifestations of her psychic power such as being able to visualize where she lost her glasses so that she can find them.  I do that all the time myself.  It means I have a strong visual memory, not that I'm destined to be a Voodoo Chief.   She's also virulently anti-white; if a Caucasian wrote a book that was as racist as this one is, people would be burning it.<br />Well, anyway, in her forties she begins to delve into her Voodoo heritage, wanting to know what lies behind ritual abuse she suffered as a child.  She travels to the Republic of Benin.  She's never heard of Benin; the name just pops into her head and she KNOWS she's destined to go there.  She travels there and is introduced to Daagbo, whom she believes is the Supreme Chief of ALL of Voodoo.  I saw no indication that he was the supreme leader of an organized, international religion.  He seemed to be a LOCAL chief, first among equals on a council of LOCAL elders.  I don't know whether he convinced her of his importance, or whether she convinced herself.  Either way, the claim seems suspect.<br />He charges her six thousand dollars to initiate her.  At first aghast, she eventually agrees to the price, and begins the rituals.  Daagbo doesn't seem much of a teacher; he never tells her what to expect or what protocol to follow before any ritual.  But, of course, her psychic powers save the day by enabling her to intuit what she needs to know.    Then Daagbo, who already has a passel of wives, breaks a taboo by hitting on Caulder.  Now, what does this woman do now?  The same woman who has been whining for weeks about the germs in the water and the possibility of catching AIDS from the sacrificial goats?  Yep, that's right, she has unprotected sex with him.  Then, she immediately demands monogamy from this man she barely knows.  Being used to the sexual services of his followers, Daagbo of course lies about this.  She then proceeds to lecture him about how his diet doesn't nourish his chakras.  (Yeah, yeah, lecture me about health when you've learned about safe sex.)  He proceeds to try to get more and more money out of her as she progresses deeper into Voodoo.  <br />I think, after Caulder left Africa, Daagbo had a good laugh about the one he pulled over on the American tourist.  At one point, Daagbo does a bogus, perfuctory initiation for an Italian grad student who is writing a paper.   Caulder is incensed.  She says she's upset because the woman is (gasp!) white.  I think it's possible her anger is due more to the fact that the \\"tourist\\" initiation hits too close to home.  Daagbo refuses to give Caulder the facial scars of an initiate.  She believes it's to spare her social ostracism in America.  But I think it's to distinguish her from the \\"real\\" initiates.  Daagbo seems to have taken her for six grand and for a walk down the garden path.  I'm glad she wasn't sucked back in by him at the end.<br />This book is very educational, but not in the way Caulder intended.  I didn't learn much about Voodoo from it.  I was too busy being mad at both Daagbo and Caulder to absorb much of the theology.  But it did teach a valuable lesson about how not to get taken in by a charismatic cult leader.	2003-01-28

I bought it primarily for the art; brilliant color photographs and original drawings are included to illustrate most of the stories.  <br />This book is also remarkable for its inclusion of often-marginalized cultures.  I've seen many a &quot;world mythology&quot; book that doesn't seem to notice that Africa or the Americas exist.  This is not one of them.  <br />It does seem to generalize a little--nobody can be a complete expert on every mythology in the world.  For example, the Celtic section emphasizes the role of male sky and sun gods, like those of Greek myth, when in fact there were many non-sky gods (both male and female) who were just as popular, and when there are many solar-related goddesses to be found in that mythology.   But this is definitely a beautiful and useful reference if you are looking for general information.	2003-01-21

She was disgruntled with the church's stance on women, but never felt moved to rock the boat much, until one day she walked into her daughter's work and found two customers sexually harassing the girl.  Something snapped inside her, and she began to question her religion's assumptions about gender and to seek a more feminist spirituality.  Her journey took her to ancient mythology, the Gnostic gospels, and to dark places in her own life as her quest caused trouble in her marriage and her religious life.   She tells us how she got through her troubles, and her story seems very human and touching.  She would feel uneasy, drop the whole subject for months, but her longing always resurfaced.  And in the end, she seems to have found peace, and some interesting insights.  This book will be interesting to Christian women trying to figure out how to reconcile religion with self-respect.  It was also interesting to me, as a pagan of several years and an agnostic before that--it helped me see value in Christianity that I had not seen before.<br />My only gripe about it is that sometimes Kidd generalizes too much.  The book is at its best when she tells her own story, but sometimes she slips into saying things like \\"A woman feels X when Y happens\\".  Everybody's journey is slightly different.	2003-01-21

Both riotously funny and sweetly touching, _Fair Peril_ is a fun and wonderful fantasy novel.  It's set in modern times, in a sort of \\"Anytown, USA\\"--where the shopping mall is a portal into Fairyland, and anything can happen.<br />It all begins when Buffy Murphy discovers a talking frog who claims to be a prince.  Buffy is a divorced and overweight woman, down on her luck, who holds down a practical job in a fake food factory and is a storyteller on the side.  Hoping a gimmick will make her storytelling more sought-after, she takes the frog home...and has no plans to kiss it and turn it back into a prince.  Enter her teenage daughter.  When the frog prince and 16-year-old Emily run away together, Buffy has to find them and rescue Emily from the story she's been caught up in.  Buffy finds herself in a world where a star-spangled nightgown renders you a wizard, where misspelling your spell can have disastrous results, and where the blue ogres lurking around the corner might be mundane cops, ready to haul you off to the local mental health center.  I won't summarize the plot from here, because it would make no sense if I tried to recount it in this space.  But it's a fun and wild ride.  In the end, Buffy learns that no story is set in stone, and it's never too late to start all over with \\"once upon a time\\".	2003-01-17

His daughter Auriane is our heroine for this rousing adventure tale, and she proves her father's words in spades.<br />As a young girl, Auriane wants nothing more than to be a happy wife and mother, like her own mother, comfortable and beloved by the hearthfire.  But her first taste of battle leaves her unsatisfied with such a life; fighting awakens a dark passion in her that she does not quite understand.  Adding to her confusion, the high priestess Ramis predicts that Auriane is also gifted with the powers of magic.  Then Auriane is thrown into the middle of the Roman-Chattian war.   I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but let me just say that violence, treachery, danger, and true love abound.   <br />Gillespie is talented at depicting her world.  She is equally at home in the forests of Germania and the crowded streets of Rome, and she takes us along with her.  She has the gift of a Margaret George or Kathleen Winsor for showing us historical detail we never could have imagined.  She's obviously done her research on everything from Roman politics to pagan customs to battle tactics.  But don't be deceived--this is no dry historical text!  I was so caught up in the story I was yelling cheers at the good guys and obscenities at the bad guys, not to mention begging for more as I realized I was on the last page.   My only gripe is that Auriane seems too good to be true at times--but maybe I wouldn't have liked the book so much had she not been &quot;larger than life&quot;.  It's hard to say.	2003-01-15

There is a reviewer below who feels grateful to this book for giving him useful information about the Wiccan culture, and so I feel obligated to write this review.<br />Jonathan Nasaw's treatment of Wicca in this novel is nothing short of slander.  He either did no research into what real Wiccans do and believe, or else he shoved his research aside in favor of sensationalism.  Nasaw's Wiccans recite the Catholic Mass backward in their rites; they include an orgy in every ritual; and they perpetrate nasty revenge when they feel wronged.  And to add to the inaccuracy, these are supposed to be Dianic Wiccans.  Dianism is a subsect of Wicca that focuses on the female aspect of divinity and holds women-only rituals.  No way would Dianic Wiccans have a ritual orgy with a bunch of men.  Nasaw's view of Wicca is straight out of the Malleus Maleficarum.  It would have been OK if he'd just called the women \\"witches\\"; it's a vague word that means different things to different people.  But he is using the name of a specific religion, and so he has a responsibility to learn something about it before he writes about it.  Why?  Because people, like the reviewer below, will think he speaks the truth.<br />If you want to read fiction about Wiccans--real Wiccans, not Nasaw's personal fantasy--try Yvonne Jocks's _Words of the Witches_ or Rosemary Edghill's _Bast Mysteries_.  The people in these books are much closer to the reality.<br />Oh, and by the way, this book is also a violent gore-fest, with scene after scene of gross-out substituted for the plot.	2003-01-15

(I'm about the only person I know who feels that way, but I do. )  Needless to say, when I discovered _The Third Witch_ , the story of one of the three Weird Sisters, during an aimless ramble through a bookstore, I snapped it up immediately.  When I got home, I started reading right away, and didn't put the book down until I had finished itm well into the wee hours.  I really, really like this. <br />The witch of the title is Gilly, an emotionally wounded teenage girl, whose world was ravaged by Lord Macbeth when she was a child.  Orphaned, Gilly was raised by the eccentric herb-women Nettle and Mad Helga, considered by the local townspeople to be witches.   Gilly, feeling like she has finally grown up and needs to seek her destiny, tries to enlist her guardians' help in revenging herself upon Macbeth.  To bring Macbeth down, Gilly needs to know more about him, and so she disguises herself as a boy and goes to work in the lord's kitchens.  She initially focuses on her quest for vengeance to the exclusion of all else, leaving hurt feelings in her wake, but eventually she begins to care for others.  This disturbs her; such weakness can only sabotage her mission.  Will Gilly learn that there is more to life than revenge?  <br />Reisert says that she sacrificed historical accuracy in favor of faithfulness to Shakespeare's play.  Frankly, I never noticed any anachronisms.  This is a good historical novel, as far as I can tell, filled with realistic detail about kitchens, herbs, warfare, and what-have-you.  Add a pleasant but unobtrusive dash of feminism, and you get a darn good book.	2003-01-09

That said, on to the good stuff.<br />You might remember this book's heroine, Briseis, from the Iliad--Achilles's concubine, stolen away by King Agamemnon.  But in _Daughter of Troy_, Briseis is so much more than a bimbo...  She's an outspoken, brave, sardonic, intelligent princess, gifted with powers of prophecy.  These powers break her heart, though, because knowing the future does not necessarily mean you can change it...<br />We read about Briseis's childhood at the court of the small kingdom of Lyrnessos, her adolescence in which she discovered sex and learned about the ruling of a kingdom, and her young adulthood as a prize of the invading Greeks.  I truly liked Briseis and enjoyed spending time reading about her; kudos to the author for writing a compelling, strong female character without loading her down in modern-day political correctness.  <br />I also liked the dark look at the ancient deities.  It is always refreshing to read historical novels where the ancient pagans aren't practicing modern Wicca.  The gods are scary in this book, appropriate given that they were thought to require constant sacrifice and to interfere often in the lives of mortals.<br />Gripes: I wanted to know more about Briseis's life after Achilles's death.  Franklin shows her as an old woman, but she only tells her story up until about age seventeen, when the war ends.  It is truly sad to imagine that nothing much of interest happened to her after that, especially with so many years ahead of her.  Perhaps I can hold out hope for a sequel.  Second, people believed Cassandra too often!  LOL!	2003-01-04

I was ready for those things to be the case, so they didn't disappoint me.  I opened the book hoping for a story like Dean's earlier _Tam Lin_, full of interesting characters, with a subtle but looming sense of the supernatural.  <br />I didn't like JG&R as much as Tam Lin, though.  For starters, I didn't feel like we got to know Gentian and her friends and family as well as we got to know Janet's circle; I wanted to know more about these people, but I always felt a little like a spectator.  Then, I couldn't understand why Gentian liked Dominic.  Hormones or no, beauty or no, any self-respecting girl would have become annoyed with him when she noticed that he almost NEVER said anything but quotes (people say the other characters quote too much, but it was Dominic who truly crossed the line).  And the annoyance would have turned to revulsion when he made the racist comments about her friend Alma.  I just don't buy into Gentian's continuued fascination with him.  I would have disliked him intensely.   Finally, I agree with the reviewer below who says the ending is unfair to Gentian; she is the one who defeated the evil, but it seems like she is punished rather than rewarded for it.<br />I had read the relevant ballad, \\"Riddles Wisely Expounded\\", before reading JG&R.  I'm not sure whether that had a good or bad effect on my reading experience.  On one hand, the denouement probably would have made less sense to me if I hadn't read the ballad; on the other hand, it was a spoiler of sorts.  I would certainly recommend reading the ballad after reading the book, just to make sense of things.  _Tam Lin_ contained a copy of its ballad; I wish this book did as well.<br />One more commenton Dominic's quoting: Though it made him an extremely annoying character, I did like the possible implications of that move by Dean.  If Dominic is in fact the mythological personage he is implied to be, it's tantalizing to think that he is just made up of the thoughts of human beings, accumulated over the years, and has no existence outside of the human imagination.  That aspect of the story will definitely stick in my mind for a long time.	2002-12-29

If you are seeking a sprawling epic that follows a famous personage from birth to death and all points between, like the books of Margaret George or Jean Plaidy, you will be disappointed with _Versailles_.  Kathryn Davis's novel about Marie Antoinette will seem episodic, disjointed, and inaccurate.  Due to Davis's penchant for writing disconnected scenes, rather than a flowing narrative, parts of this book make no sense unless you're armed with a great deal of knowledge about the period.  For example, the Dauphin's death is mentioned, and then a little while later, people are talking about the Dauphin again, who seems to have come back from the grave.  In fact, the second Dauphin was born before the first one's death, but the younger prince's birth is never mentioned in the book--or even his name.  If you didn't already know about him, that part would be quite confusing.  And there are errors as well--the Tuileries was not burned to the ground, as Davis attests.  Napoleon lived in it, for pete's sake.  Personally, I'm a big fan of the sort of historical novel that depicts a time period in as much detail as a nonfiction book would, but using the fictional form to infuse emotion and drama into the events.<br />But this is another sort of book entirely.  Once I got over wishing this was a Margaret George book (pick on me if you will, I don't care), I began to enjoy _Versailles_ for what it is:  a poetic, experimental novella.  Davis uses a series of scenes, tableaux maybe, to show us Antoinette's story.  Some are in first-person prose, some in third-person prose, some in the form of a play script, some in poetry.  There is even a scene based on a painting that has a certain gruesome connection to the Bourbon rulers.  All of the scenes are strung together quite loosely, so that if you don't know anything about the period, you'll be lost.  But if you do know some of the history, the scenes do add some color to it.  Early in the book, they are funny, saucy, and irreverent.  The end of the book, fittingly, takes a somber and haunting tone; I was especially moved by Antoinette's time in prison, her death, and her existence as something other than herself after that.  The last sentence of the book is a stunner--I won't give it away.<br />This book is pretty good, if you think of it as a sort of prose poem about Antoinette rather than a narrative, and if you already know much of her history.  Or maybe if you just want to read evocative, beautiful prose.	2002-12-23

When the broad lines of a story are so well-known by almost everyone, and the fact that it ends tragically is equally well-known, it is truly a challenge to take that story and tell it so well that a reader is compelled to keep turning page after page nevertheless.  Especially when there are 964 of those pages.  With this novel, Margaret George shows she is definitely up to the challenge, and meets it with stunning success.<br />She brings the age of the much-maligned last queen of Egypt to vivid life, sweeping us away to ancient Egypt, Rome, and parts beyond.   We live through those years with Cleopatra, following her as she falls in love with the inscrutable Caesar and later the boisterous, sensual Antony, and as she worships her goddess Isis and adores her four children.  All of the characters, from the very sympathetic Cleo, Caesar, and Antony, to the chilling Octavian, to lesser-known personages like the feminist Kandake of Meroe and Cleo's loving handmaidens, are made real to us, not just figures in a dusty history textbook.   We are transported to their world, drawn with loads of descriptive detail and sensuality, and even a smattering of humor where we least expect it.  &quot;Do you go into heat every time a Roman comes over the horizon?&quot; teases one of Cleopatra's close friends.   Also adding drama is an abundance of mythological metaphor; these people were seen as gods in their own time, and the stories of the ancient deities play themselves out in the lives of the human characters again and again.<br />In the end, of course, this is a tragedy.  By the time the fall comes, the characters are old friends, and the reader is truly saddened by what happens to them.  I was left with the fervent hope that there really is an afterlife somewhere, where Cleo, Caesar, and Antony are feasting together for all eternity.   This is one of my favorite novels ever; it takes a little while to read it, but it is VERY worth the time and effort.	2002-12-21

This is not a &quot;pretty&quot; book.  It's really more horror than fantasy, full of violence and truly twisted characters.  That said, I enjoyed this book.  It stands out, with a few others, as a novel that presents a distinctive and original way of looking at the Otherworld, the faerie realm.  <br />Hetley's &quot;Summer Country&quot; is ruled by those of the Old Blood, scheming and utterly inhuman despots who keep slaves and mold reality to their wills.  Into a war between two of this kind, come four others.  Maureen, an emotionally wounded, reclusive young woman, carrying the Old Blood unknowingly in her veins.  Jo, her sensual older sister.  David, a performer of Celtic music.  And Brian, born of the Old Blood but sworn to Christianity.  Maureen and Brian are each desired by a powerful ruler of the Summer Country as brood stock.  For the Old Blood comes with certain liabilities, and these two will be good for the bloodlines.  <br />And so they are drawn into the Summer Country, where human weapons are useless.  Only Power can win the day.  Will the newcomers find their Power before it's too late?  <br />My only gripe about this book is that I wouldn't have minded it being longer.  The romantic subplots seem a little rushed, as does the defeat of at least one of the villains .  And I would certainly like to know more about Brian and the mission of the Pendragons.	2002-12-08

OK, so it's a cute title, and in keeping with the rest of the glib titles of Selma Eichler's books.  But it telegraphs way too much of the plot!  The mystery, at face value, seems to have nothing to do with an affair.  The title tells you what to look for.<br />The mystery is too easily solved--there is only one clear solution to it, beginning very early on.  So this book is padded with chapter after chapter of Desiree missing the clues, plus a completely annoying chapter in which Desiree looks down her nose at a bridal store employee.  Now, this saleswoman is a pain in the posterior, to be sure, but Desiree's barbs are more directed at the size of the saleswoman's own posterior.  This from a P.I. who is supposed to be appealing because she is plus-sized?  OK, so maybe it's OK to be plus-sized as long as you aren't any bigger than Desiree...whatever size she is...or at least it seemed that Eichler was trying to convey something like that.	2002-11-14
US	49828549	R2XG34I1NOMHF6	0345409329	645550608	Blood and Gold (Vampire Chronicles)	Books	4	10	10	N	N	(3.5) Two sides to every story	I enjoyed this book, except for the subplot about the Norse vampire, Thorne, at the beginning and end.  This frame story had a lot of promise but ended up making little sense to me.  I think maybe it alludes to Norse myth, which has never been my forte.  Whatever the reason, it left me scratching my head.  <br />But at least it gets Marius telling his life story, and perhaps because the &quot;interviewer&quot; is a stranger, he feels comfortable opening up about all sorts of things.  In the words of Alanis Morissette, it's &quot;strangely exciting, to watch the stoic squirm.&quot;  Yes, at times Marius's story seems really familiar, since most of the major plot events have been told already in _The Vampire Lestat_, _Pandora_, and _The Vampire Armand_.  But now we know just how broken-up Marius was about some of the tragedies in his &quot;life&quot;.   We find out how much he loved Pandora, and how much he had to lean on a certain other vampire (I'll avoid the spoiler) after Santino burned him.  I especially love the fact that his recollection of his brief reunion with Pandora is so very different from Pandora's version.  Pandora says the Indian vamp was a jerk and that she didn't love him; Marius believes the two were codependent as heck.  And Marius breaks someone else's heart that night as well.  Even the letter, lost for fifty years, is different between the two books.<br />In short, this is a pretty good book.  You may feel like you've read all this stuff before, but if you pay close attention, you'll get to see the other side of the cool, logical Marius.	2002-11-12

It has all the right stuff--a sweeping, decades-spanning story of love lost and regained, cameos by historical figures, a compassionate hero, and a feisty heroine.  It's the tale of Evan Carew, a fictional compatriot of the very real Francis Drake.  Evan loses his first love to Spanish tyranny and finds happiness again with a courageous tomboy who carries a secret drop of royal blood.  Fate and political machinations tear them apart---what will happen when they meet again?<br />The only gripe I have about this book is that I wanted more!  This is a long story, and parts of it seemed a little rushed,.	2002-10-29

LOL.  I alsmot didn't buy it because I thought it was about fashion and beauty.  Of course, the book's appearance could be an asset as well as a hindrance--if I can make that mistake, someone else could make the opposite mistake, thinking the book was about makeup and ending up learning something.  So maybe the cover is intended to appeal to people who would normally be put off by &quot;New Age&quot; or &quot;occult&quot; stuff.  Makes sense.  _Awakening Your Goddess_ deals with feminine archetypes from ancient pagan religions, but would not be intimidatingly &quot;occult-y&quot; to a person who doesn't normally read that sort of thing.<br />_Awakening Your Goddess_ begins with an oversimplified version of the matriarchy theory.  You know the one: Everybody lived happily and peacefully, worshipping the Great Mother, until the Big Bad Invaders from the North showed up, inventing war and banishing goddesses from the pantheon.  You'll want your shaker of salt handy for this section.<br />The book gets better when it explores the actual goddesses.  From Kwan Yin to Kali, from the Cailleach to Artemis, Liz Simpson gives the basic myth of each goddess and then a list of her &quot;functional&quot; and &quot;dysfunctional&quot; qualities--which can show up in human women's personalities.  For example, it's good that Artemis is &quot;independent&quot;, but she runs into trouble because she is &quot;ruthless&quot;.  You get the idea.  Simpson provides tips for developing or downplaying the goddesses' personality traits in your own life.  Meditation, altar creation, journaling, and various other activities are recommended.   It's not the deepest-delving goddess-psych book I've seen, but it is a good intro and pretty insightful.<br />It's not perfect--Simpson seems blind to the good sides of some goddesses and the bad sides of others.  The Welsh goddesses Cerridwen and Blodeuwedd are presented as one-dimensionally dysfunctional, while Gaia's vengeful temper is completely overlooked in Simpson's portrait of the perfect Earth Mother archetype.  It's a shame about Gaia, since her entry comes right after Hera's.  Gaia's act of violence against her devouring husband could have been used to contrast with Hera's misdirected anger at her husband's girlfriends.  At least Gaia knew whom to be mad at . . .<br />If you want to go deeper into &quot;Goddess-based self-help&quot;, try these books:  _Invoke the Goddess_ by Kala Trobe (Greek/Hindu/Egyptian deities), _The Silver Wheel_ by Marguerite Elsbeth and Kenneth Johnson (Celtic deities, especially Welsh), _Mysteries of the Dark Moon_ by Demetra George (Greek/Mesopotamian), and _Goddesses in Everywoman_ by Jean Shinoda Bolen (which I haven't read but have heard good things about).	2002-10-12

It has a page for every tarot card, with a brief meaning, and plenty of blank space where you can write your own personal notes about what that card means to you.  <br />In addition, though the blurb doesn't even mention this, it comes with a miniature version of the &quot;Tarot Nova&quot; in cardboard, which you can &quot;tear along the dotted lines&quot; and then you have a little tarot deck.  It's quite small, so it might not be of much use except as a conversation piece.  Or, you could get a box/pouch/etc. and carry this deck in your purse in case you feel the urge to do a spur-of-the-moment reading in the coffee shop.	2002-10-10
US	49828549	R28AKPZ01L82XO	0441009735	402359629	All Night Awake	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A pleasant surprise	Lately it seems that all fantasy writers must write trilogies--even if they only have one book's worth of story--because that's what is in fashion now.  I've read enough dud sequels lately to last me a few decades.  This book is an exception.  For starters, I wasn't even expecting a sequel to _Ill Met by Moonlight_.  That novel was complete in itself and very satisfactory.  So, seeing that a sequel had appeared was a pleasant surprise--since Hoyt hadn't blatantly set it up with loose ends as many authors do.<br />I didn't like this book quite as much as Ill Met, for three reasons.  First, the metaphysics were more confusing than in the first book.  Second, the constant use of Shakespearean quotes gets a little heavy-handed from time to time.  Third, this book doesn't stand on its own as well as Ill Met; it would make no sense without the first volume and too obviously sets up the third.<br />However, _All Night Awake_ is a good book.  Quicksilver, the gender-bending elf who became king of Fairyland at the end of Ill Met, has ruled his kingdom now for ten mortal years.  At the behest of his beloved wife, Ariel, he has promised fidelity and suppressed his female aspect, Lady Silver.  But when his evil brother, Sylvanus, hatches a diabolical plan to take over the world, Quicksilver must go to London to save both the human world and the elfin one.  And there, Lady Silver demands her share of attention--for there live two of her ex-lovers.  Will Shakespeare, starving artist, determined to remain faithful to his wife after his one lapse.  And Kit Marlowe, famous and admired, but haunted by memories of his fairy lover and by the deaths of men he has betrayed over the years.  Without being preachy or pedantic, Hoyt delivers a moving story of love and honor, marriage and temptation, friendship and betrayal.  And along the way, there's a bit of humor.  For example, Marlowe makes a habit of never actually calling Shakespeare \\"Shakespeare\\".  Instead he cobbles together synonyms--\\"Wigglestick\\" is one example.  <br />I would add the caveat that this book is more violent than _Ill Met by Moonlight_.	2002-10-07
US	49828549	R1CNOEPVZPXA66	0886778999	570837980	The Golden Key (Daw Book Collectors)	Books	5	8	9	N	N	(4.5)	Melanie Rawn, Jennifer Roberson, and Kate Elliott collaborate here to create a novel that is very hard to put down--despite its formidable length and flattish characters.  What drew me in was the carefully designed world, the totally believable magic, the overall mood, and the centuries-spanning plot.  This novel is set in Tirra Virte, an Italy-ish province where all official ceremonies and transactions are recorded not with words but with paintings.  I thoight for a moment--&quot;Hey!  That can't be reliable!  The artist can paint something that didn't really happen!&quot;  But then it made me realize just how unreliable words, too, can be.  A scribe can write lies as easily as an artist can paint them.  <br />This art-centered world, of course, requires artists.  This novel follows the rising and falling fortunes of one family of artists, the Grijalvas, who are almost indisputably the best artists in Tirra Virte.  However, they are also decimated by a past plague, feared for their reputed sorcery, and shunned for carrying the blood of foreign rapists in their veins.  A young Grijalva boy wants nothing so much as to be acknowledged &quot;Gifted&quot;, an heir to the Grijalvas' genetic talents, but the art and magic come with a terrible price.<br />WARNING: possible SPOILERS<br />The book is divided into three sections, taking place in three different time periods.  The sections are different enough in tone and style that I suspect each author wrote a section mostly by herself, with little collaboration except in world-building.  However, I'm not familiar enough with the authors to guess who wrote what.<br />The first section is my personal favorite because of its brooding and menacing mood.  Two Grijalva children, the male Sario and the female Saavedra, witness a terrible punishment meted out by the family elders, and come to realize what Grijalva power really means.  The two grow to adulthood--Sario becoming an acclaimed artist and lusting for more and more power,and Saavedra's skills ignored because she is a woman.  When Saavedra finds love outside the family, passion and jealousy erupt, and a terrible magic is performed upon her...<br />The second section is more of a romance, featuring a beautiful, naive, and Generically Nice princess who marries into Tirra Verteian nobility, only to be cruelly rejected in favor of her husband's Grijalva mistress.  Princess Mechella does her best to make a happy life for herself despite all of this.  I do like the fact that she eventually grew a spine, but I don't like the fact that the &quot;happy ending&quot; to this second story took place with absolutely no action by Mechella.  She never even knew half of what was going on.  Sigh...<br />The third section is a story of liberty.  The lower classes of Tirra Virte are in revolt.  At the same time a young Grijalva woman, groomed to be a compliant daughter and an acquiescent royal mistress, sets out to make her life and art her own.  And it is she who notices something strange about the portrait of Saavedra which hangs in the palace.  I liked this section, though it seems a little rushed, what with trying to cram the third story and the loose ends from the other two into what is probably the shortest of the three.<br />I truly enjoyed this book, though it left a few loose ends hanging.  I want to know more about the Tza'ab, the Nerro Lingua, and how Saavedra managed to be born Gifted.  I REALLY want to know more about what happened when Eleyna's brother scratched the painting containing Eleyna's blood!  It's not often I reach the end of a 900 page book crying out for more.	2002-10-03

(Durga, for example, is referred to as evil, which is somewhat less than accurate.)  Spirits, demons, djinns, faeries, and their kin are all present and accounted for.

Monaghan's emotional and moving poetry is wonderful. You can just read it for enjoyment, or use it in ritual. It includes \\"general\\" poems about witchcraft, a lot of Greek- and Celtic- inspired material, a few poems dealing with other myths, and a dash of fairy-tale material. All of it is very good. (One thing that makes Monaghan stand out in her field, by the way, is her refusal to bash males. Other goddess authors ignore or demean men, but many of Monaghan's poems celebrate love for men in a sensual and lyrical way.) <br />There is also a gorgeous accompanying CD, featuring several performers who have set selected poems to music. You'll want to hang on to this, too, either just to listen to for pleasure, or to play during ritual.<br />I would talk more specifically about the poems, but I can't do them justice in prose. I wish Amazon had a \\"see inside\\" feature on this book, so you could browse the first few poems and see if you like Monaghan's style.<br />I also must commend cover artist Gavin Duffy. For a moment, I thought Monaghan had switched publishers! Note to Llewellyn: More covers like this, please! In fact, more books like these--both in appearance and in content. This is a rare gem.	2002-09-19

This one, the Fairy Ring, is stunning.  Working again with computer-manipulated photographs, these creative British Wiccans have designed a deck that captures the wildness, beauty, and sometimes horror of the faery folk of Britain.<br />The deck is divided into four suits: Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter, with the faeries assigned to whichever season is the closest match for their energies.  There are also eight additional cards representing the major holidays of Wicca.  Every last one of the cards is a visual spectacle, and none of them have that telltale blah-ness that indicates that the artist is out of ideas.   I suspect that the deck will be a little difficult to learn, since it's not based on tarot, but I've never minded reading up on faeries.<br />Each of the cards represents one of the traditional faeries of folklore.  Other faery decks concentrate on the authors' personal vision of faeries (Brian Froud), or on pop psychology (Doreen Virtue), but with this deck we're in &quot;Katherine Briggs Land&quot;.  The book gives a sort of capsule bio of each faery, so that we know what its nature is and what it means in a reading.  The faeries range from ethereally beautiful to earthy to creepy to &quot;I sure hope I don't meet THAT in a dark alley&quot;.  It is a credit to Franklin and Mason that they absolutely do not &quot;sugarcoat&quot; any of the darker faeries.  They are SCARY as portrayed in the art, and the book advises not trying to contact them in meditation.  <br />My personal favorite is the &quot;Lhiannan Shee&quot; card.  Mason portrays the traditional vampire-muse as a green sprite hovering above a bottle on the writer's desk.  I love the double meaning.  For the faery depicted might be the Lhiannan Shee--or she might be the &quot;green faery&quot; absinthe, which led 19th century artists into a more mundane sort of danger.<br />The only gripe I can think of about this deck is that Franklin and Mason have only a handful of models for their cards.  This can get a little distracting when I start recognizing the models from one card to the next, or even between the two decks.  &quot;Hey wait a second, Morgan le Fay, didn't I just see you on the BeFind card?&quot;  It is sometimes necessary to suspend disbelief a little.	2002-09-19

Less David!	...  <br />I was looking forward to the story of Merrick, a distant biracial cousin of the famous Mayfair Witches, who practices voudoun.  I was looking forward to Louis's quest for the ghost of Claudia--but then I've always liked Louis.  In this book, in fact, a lot of ineresting things happen to Louis--the Claudia thing, a new love, and a complete change of heart about how much vampiric power he wants.  (I'll try not to commit a spoiler by telling any more details than that.)  In other words, lots of character development.<br />So, my major gripe with this book is that it isn't told from Louis's point of view, but David Talbot's.  See, David has had a crush on Merrick since she was a teenager seeking refuge with the Talamasca.  And while some of the interaction between David and Merrick is interesting, I would have preferred to cut a few of the chapters describing the infatuation, making room for more Louis-stuff.   Fascinating things go on in this book--but we are only spectators.	2002-09-18

Once they get there, things get strange--Richard begins acting like an utter jerk, while Celia begins to have strange fits and visions.  Celia's mother has befriended a Hindu guru, Dr. Akananda, and it is he who figures out what's wrong with the young couple.  The troubles of the present time can only be solved by revisiting a tragedy from the past.<br />And so the older story begins, in the reign of Edward VI, as lovely young Celia de Bohun and her loving aunt take up residence with a grand family as \\"poor relations\\".   Celia is a fascinating and \\"real\\" character, full of contradictions and human failings.  She is headstrong and impulsive; dreaming of true love but entranced by male flattery; innocent but coquettish.  She creates a scandal when she falls in love with the family chaplain, Stephen--who in turn desires Celia but does not want to break his vow of chastity.  They part--but never forget each other.  Time passes; Edward's persecution of Catholics gives way to Mary's persecution of Protestants; the family fortunes rise and fall; sympathetic characters harden into detestable ones (I weep for you, Magdalen!).  Anya Seton draws us deeply into her world, filled with schemes, ambition, and lies; and with ghosts, madwomen, superstitions, and a particular, notorious Celtic witch.    And when Celia and Stephen finally meet again, nothing can stop the power between them.  It ends tragically, and we cry; we've been so sucked into the Tudor story that we forget we're headed back to the 1960's to resolve it all.  <br />One gripe:  It always gets on my nerves when authors of historical fiction insert modern beauty standards into their novels.  I didn't like the treatment of the overweight girl, Mabel.  This story is supposed to be taking place in a time when \\"pleasingly plump\\" was a compliment and not a euphemism.  Had Mabel really lived, I doubt she would have been thought of so derisively.  However, this gripe is sort of offset by the kudos I must give to Seton for having a sympathetic gay character in her novel--especially considering the date of publication.  Even current romance writers (who should know better) still tend to assign homosexuality to the most depraved of villains.  So, I grumble about Seton's treatment of the overweight, but I'm impressed with her treatment of the gay man in the story.  <br />Overall:  An enthralling story.  Starts slow, but by the time you get to the halfway point, you won;t be able to put it down.	2002-09-15
US	49828549	R3OWPEYHYOH2MG	0380791358	583186323	Melusine	Books	4	9	9	N	N	A Gothic puzzle	Lynne Reid Banks's _Melusine_ is a fine example of the sort of book I like to call \\"Teen Celto-Gothic\\"--defined by mysterious places, dark family secrets, and forces of mythology that make themselves known in the mundane world.  Among such novels are older books like Garner's _The Owl Service_ and Pope's _The Perilous Gard_ , and newer books like Liz Berry's _The China Garden_.  _Melusine_ is another of this sort, and certainly good enough to be on the shelf with these others.<br />The story begins as Roger (whose age I estimate at 14 or so), his parents, and his little sisters arrive at the run-down French chateau where they will be spending their vacation.  Their first impression of the house is inauspicious; the front rooms are squalid, and the owner, one Monsieur Serpe, a belligerent jerk.  But things seem to get better.  The part of the house where Roger's family will be staying is well-kept and pretty.  And Roger begins to make friends with Serpe's shy daughter, Melusine.  <br />The family vacation turns sinister as Roger begins to hear the sound of something slithering through his room at night.  And a struggle he witnesses between Serpe and Melusine suggests a more ordinary but more disturbing horror. Stranger and stranger things happen, and all the while Roger's feelings for Melusine deepen.  When he reads about the mythical Melusine in a guidebook, the situation at the chateau begins to become clear--but in order to believe what he knows to be true, Roger must allow himself to believe in the impossible.   Can Melusine be saved from the horror at the chateau, or can she save herself?   This is a creepy, moody, engrossing novel recommended to those who like that sort of thing.  I couldn't put it down.	2002-09-13

I've read several books that borrow zillions of plot elements from _War for the Oaks_, but never reach the same sort of exhilarating heights.  Yeah, yeah, we all know the story: young woman wanders the city at night and meets a mysterious stranger, so on, so forth.  Now sit back and see it done right!<br />Eddi McCandry has just quit her boyfriend's abysmal band, and now plans to break up with the boyfriend as well.  But before she gets the chance to talk to him, she gets recruited into a war between the Seelie and Unseelie Courts, for the heart and soul and magic of Minneapolis.  You see, the Fair Folk can't wound each other in battle unless there is a human there to lend mortality.  The Seelie Court needs Eddi in order to make their sparring a war rather than a mere sport.   <br />What follows is a romp of an adventure, as Eddi juggles her new band, Seelie matters, and two very different Faerie men.  One will dazzle her with beauty and charm; the other will surprise her with courage and devotion.  I disagree with the reviewers who griped about the love story.  First of all, the romance is sweet and intense, and *feels real*, which means something in a world where main characters seem to fall in love solely because one of them is the male lead and the other is the female lead.  The relationship unfolds naturally, and I had goosebumps on my arms and a tear in my eye when I read the stormy-night love scene.  Second, the romantic subplots do a great job of showing the differences between the human mind and the Faerie psyche.<br />Ever notice how, in some urban fantasy novels, the faeries are just like normal people, except that they have prettier hair and don't know how to use household appliances?  This is not one of those novels.  One of Emma Bull's achievements with this novel is that she sheds some light on the way faeries think.  What do faeriesthink of love?  Why don't they like being thanked?  Using scraps of lore, Bull creates a vivid view of Faerie culture.<br />And along the way, she also takes us on a wild ride through the land of rock music, showing us the way a band forms, and eventually, ideally, becomes like family.  She captures the exhilaration of performing music, and the magic the music evokes.  And as an added bonus, Bull is pretty darn good at writing rock lyrics.  I wonder if those are actual songs I could find recordings of, if I knew the name of her band.	2002-09-13

A sword-wielding hunk, dressed in a ruffled, billowing \\"poet's shirt\\" from the 1800's. A wizened dwarf stirring a cauldron.  And of course, a cat.  (The cat is possible the only figure in the cover art who actually resembles a character in the book.)<br />On the inside:  An enchanting tale that captures the spirit of Arthurian legend--but without actually being a retelling of it.  Yes, parallels can be seen between some characters and events, but this is essentially an original work.  The plot involves the King's spiteful sister Diaspad, who sows discord at court, and the Queen Sidonwy, who falls into disgrace as a result of Diaspad's machinations.  Our hero and heroine are an idealistic knight who wants to restore the kingdom to its earlier glory and chivalry, and a shy sorcerer's apprentice who doesn't think she has any power.  The plot is simple but compelling; the characters grow so real that I literally wanted to slap one of them when he broke my heart.  You'll know the scene when you read it.  <br />Two gripes only:<BR>(1) Court dramas, because of the sheer volume of characters, generally benefit from having a \\"Dramatis Personae\\" in the front of the book that the reader can refer to if s/he has forgotten who so-and-so is and what his agenda is.  <BR>(2) Series-itis!  It is frustrating to get emotionally involved with a novel only to find that it doesn't really have any closure.  _Child of Saturn_ ties up some of the loose ends of the plot, but leaves enough hanging that this book can't really stand on its own.  This is especially annoying since Edgerton's books are hard to find.  It looks like I'll probably have to collect them gradually and read them out of order.	2002-09-08
US	49828549	R3DITM16Y0VEWK	0425184978	107328132	Words of the Witches	Books	4	5	5	N	N	(3.5)	In _Words of the Witches_, editor Yvonne Jocks brings together a variety of authors from several genres, with one common thread:  all are neo-pagans, or at least pagan-sympathetic.  In this book, they present stories, spells, and a little bit of poetry--all of which are concerned with the daily lives of the people who call themselves \\"Witches\\".<br />I bought this book mainly because it contained a new installment in Rosemary Edghill's \\"Bast\\" series.  Unfortunately, that story, \\"The Iron Bride\\" is a little disappointing.  It's as well-written as her other mysteries, but it suffers a bit by being written in the short story form.  It's hard to write a mystery that short; such stories usually need more time to develop tangled plot twists and drop clues.  (Poe and Doyle could write short mysteries, but they were the defining masters of the genre.)  While \\"The Iron Bride\\" is not bad at all, it probably would have been better at novel length.  As it is, everything falls into place just a little too quickly and easily.  However, Edghill's trademark wit, command of occult lore, and philosophizing keep the story from being too disappointing.<br />My favorite story in the book is \\"Anytown, USA\\", by Maggie Shayne, a writer I'd never read before.  In this story, the wife of an small-town Christian minister begins to explore Wicca, just as the arrival of two Wiccan teenagers ignites anger and prejudice in the local high school.  The ending is very idealistic, but Shayne admits this freely; this is how she *wishes* such situations would turn out.<br />Also included in this book are several romances, a touching story about terminal illness, a story about an elderly Romani woman trying to draw her daughters back to the old ways, and some stories about friendship and other matters.  All of them deal with paganism and/or Wicca not as \\"fantasy\\" but as a part of the lives of regular people, and all of them consider issues of ethics, responsibility, and pagan philosophy.  Interspersed with the stories are several simple and harmless spells.<br />Why did I rate this book only a 3.5?  I think it's because I'm not really the target audience for it.  This book is more geared toward someone just getting into a pagan religion, or perhaps an outsider wanting to know \\"what witches are really like\\".  For example, in almost every story, someone casts a circle--in exacting detail, in the manner of a how-to book.  This book seems like an enjoyable and painless introduction to pagan (especially Wiccan) practices and issues.   If you've been on your path for years, you might want to check this out from the library, or buy it as a gift for your neophyte friend.	2002-09-03
US	49828549	RVAJ8Q4IQIR02	0345334531	63633228	The Feast of All Saints	Books	5	20	22	N	N	An old favorite of mine (and Rice's best, IMHO)	This book, along with the Baroque Italian novel _Cry to Heaven_, are curiosities among Anne Rice's oeuvre-- straight-up historical novels without any supernatural elements.  And despite the lack of vampires, despite the fact that the only &quot;witch&quot; in the book is a madam pretending to practice magic, I firmly believe that _Feast of All Saints_ is Rice's best work.  I first read it six years ago, pulling an all-nighter because I couldn't bear to put it down, and I reread it every year or so.<br />_Feast of All Saints_ is set in antebellum New Orleans, among a subculture known as the Gens de Couleur Libre (Free People of Color).  They were people of mixed race, descended from white planters and their black mistresses.  While their lives are circumscribed by myriad rules, and they are forever considered second-class citizens, they have also grown complacent about the ways in which they are fortunate.  Perhaps the most shocking thing I learned from this book was that the Free People, conveniently forgetting their own heritage, often kept slaves.  Sometimes the slaves were even blood relatives of their owners.  One of the best themes in the novel is the character Marcel's realization that he is luckier than he believes.  It was an accident of birth that he was not born the legitimate heir to his rich white father.  But it was also an accident that he was not born into the unsung ranks of the field hands.  Rice paints a vivid portrait of this society, with its complex rules, strange bigotries, and dreams--a society where looking a little more black or a little more white than your peers might make all the difference in the world.<br />But lest you believe this is just a Stuffy Novel about Deep Social Issues, it's also a darn good story.  Rice illuminates the society through the eyes of four young people growing up and coming to terms with it.  Marcel, intellectual and arrogant, dreams of the artsy life in Paris--but must learn to come to terms with himself in NewOrleans.  Richard's parents have built an elegant, polite bourgeois dynasty--but Richard will have to give up his true love if he wants to inherit it.  Anna Bella, pitied for her African features, is sold into a liaison with a white man who loves her but can never acknowledge her publicly.  And quietly intense Marie, considered beautiful because she looks white, is pushed toward a career at the quadroon balls, where she can make her family's fortune--but lose her self-respect.  These four engrossing characters, plus many more, struggle to find self-respect and love in the face of all the rules.  Reviewer &quot;odilon&quot; is right--the line &quot;You are coming with me. Now.&quot; is the finest moment of this book, the words thundering through the characters' world.  You'll be pumping your fist in the air and cheering, or crying, or maybe both.  (I seem to remember I accidentally woke my roommate up the first time I read that scene.)<br />Another reviewer complains of Anne Rice's misogyny.  I'm tired of it too, but it isn't really evident in this book.  The female characters, even the contemptible ones, are as well fleshed-out as the males.  I don't really mind if some of the women are unsympathetic, as long as they're not cardboard.  Some of the most fascinating characters in _Feast_ are women.	2002-08-28
US	49828549	R1G30YVZZENGBK	0886776228	36453099	The Sword of Maiden's Tears (Twelve Treasures)	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Pamela Dean meets a slasher movie	I've become a bit of a Rosemary Edghill fan lately, so I opened the cover of this foray into urban fantasy with anticipation. It takes place in New York in the eighties (take note of the clothing styles for a nostalgic chuckle). Thrust into the teeming streets of New York City is elfin lord Melior--and of course, as an out-of-towner, he gets mugged almost instantly. The mugger steals his magic sword and leaves him bruised and shaken. Melior is taken in by a young grad student, Ruth, and gets to know her and her circle of friends. This circle of friends is the best part of the book. Ruth, Philip, Jane, Naomi, and Michael are all intelligent misfits, drawn together by the feeling that they don't fit in anywhere else, and sharing a tight but often uneasy bond. The unofficial \\"den mother\\" of the bunch is Naomi; the group spends most of their time at Naomi's apartment, eating Naomi's cooking, and quoting dead poets. In a way, they're a lot like the dorm gang of Pamela Dean's \\"Tam Lin\\"--except with more angst. For several of the friends are hiding secrets and emotional wounds.<br />Melior's addition to the group changes everything; the friends fight over whether to help him find the sword, and whether he's really an elf. But if he's an elf--and not a loony or a con artist--they'd better find the sword soon. It is cursed. Any human who touches it will turn into a cannibalistic monster obsessed with two things: eating people, and hanging on to the sword. And the monster can only be killed by--you guessed it--the selfsame sword. New York is in trouble.<br />Unfortunately, the main plot of this book is a little too \\"slasher movie\\" for my taste. It isn't bad, but it's violent and sort of simplistic. I almost felt like the interesting characters were wasted on a plot that's mostly \\"run around New York trying to find this thing without getting killed\\". I would have liked a more complex plot, not to mention a better-developed romantic subplot. Melior and Ruth meet. BAM! Love. That's about it. I am looking forward to further characterization and character development in the second book, \\"The Cup of Morning Shadows\\".	2002-08-23

This novel, a fictionalization of the French Revolution set in the invented kingdom of \\"Vonahr\\" and laced with a little bit of magic, is a gem of historical fantasy and ought to be a classic. The author combines epic ideals, all-too-human characters, and lovely prose to create a book I couldn't put down and will never forget.<br />The events of these turbulent times are seen through the eyes of a high-born young woman, Eliste vo Derrivalle. Eliste is at first a product of her society and upbringing--a spoiled brat who doesn't think to question her class's superiority over the serfs and working class. She is only willing to respect one serf--the brilliant Dref Zeenoson, whose talents belie everything Eliste has been taught about the inferiority of his kind. When Eliste's father shows himself as a cruel master, and Dref defies him, only Eliste can save Dref from a terrible fate. She frees him--and then tries to put this subversive incident out of her mind.<br />For Eliste has been appointed as a maid of honor to the Queen herself. She travels to the capital and is trained in courtly ways. But the fairy-tale court is not long for this world; a revolution is beginning. When Eliste loses everything she had taken for granted, she will have to learn to survive just like everyone else. But she will not always be without help--for there is one person who has never forgotten Eliste's first act of heroism. This is an enthralling, heartbreaking, and suspenseful story, made all the better by its wonderfully drawn characters: the ingenious Dref, the stubbornly dignified grand dame Zeralenn, the incorrigibly shallow Aurelie, the so-sweet Kairthe, and even the terrifying Whiss v'Aleur, who lays waste to a nation to assuage his childhood feelings of inadequacy. But most of all, Eliste, who matures into a very different sort of woman than she had planned to become.<br />This is not just a good fantasy; it also holds its own with the best sort of straight-up historical fiction, illuminating a place and time from its hovels to its palaces, as seen through the eyes of memorable characters. If you like fantasy, read this book. If you don't normally go for fantasy, but like a good romantic historical epic, suspend your disbelief about the magic and read it anyway. And if you're like me, and like both genres--don't hesitate another moment.	2002-08-21

Jacqueline Carey returns to the lush and decadent world of Terre d'Ange in \\"Kushiel's Chosen\\", sequel to the strange but beautiful \\"Kushiel's Dart\\", and produces a sequel that unfortunately doesn't quite live up to its predecessor.<br />Our masochistic heroine, Phedre, leaves behind her comfortable new life as a country countess when she begins to suspect that all is not well in Terre d'Ange.  She believes that Melisande Shahrizai, from her hiding place in La Serenessima (Venice), still plots against Queen Ysandre--with the help of at least one D'Angeline noble.  But who is her co-conspirator, and what are they planning?  Phedre returns to prostitution in the hopes of finding clues, but doesn't accomplish much except driving away her bodyguard-lover Joscelin.  Phedre decides there is only one thing to do--travel to La Serenissima and investigate there.  In Italy, Phedre uncovers the conspiracy--but disaster strikes and she finds herself lost at sea and entangled with pirates.  Now, Phedre's task is to get back to La Serenissima in time to save Ysandre.  Along the way, she begins to realize that maybe being marked by the angel of punishment means more than having weird sexual proclivities.<br />While \\"Chosen\\" is a decent book, it fails to engage the reader in the way that \\"Dart\\" did.  I think my essential problem lies with the middle section of the book--the pirate part.  Maybe it's because Phedre's skills are espionage and seduction, not sailing and fighting, so she doesn't do much during this period of time except sit around and feel guilty whenever someone dies.  Maybe it's because this sequence doesn't seem to advance the main plot any (except maybe that Phedre's absence makes Joscelin think about his feelings).   It almost feels like Carey wrote the beginning and ending of the book, then said, \\"Oh no...I unraveled the conspiracy too quickly and now I need 300 more pages.\\"   <br />This isn't a bad book; it's a faster read than \\"Dart\\", though it never attains theheartbreaking power or the sensuality of the previous novel.  I still plan to read the third.	2002-08-21
US	49828549	R2UDPOAZ458YN0	0671622013	888744944	Queen of the Summer Stars	Books	4	1	1	N	N	The book I didn't plan on reading	My first attempt at reviewing this book never appeared on the page; I think it's because I called Morgause a nasty name.  LOL.  So, my reviews for this book and the following book, _Guinevere: The Legend in Autumn_, will be out of order.<br />I didn't plan on reading this book, since I was disappointed with its prequel, _Child of the Northern Spring_. But I was in an Arthurian mood, and saw the last two volumes at the library, and said \\"Hey, what the heck.\\"  And I was pleasantly surprised by books two and three; I'm glad I changed my mind and read them.<br />_Queen of the Summer Stars_ starts slowly; Guinevere seems more like a fly-on-the-wall narrator than a character for the first half of the book.  She constantly regales us with all of the doings in Camelot--every banquet, affair, and border skirmish.  But she doesn't talk much about what's going on in her own head.  The result of this is that, whenever she suddenly acts with strong emotion, it comes out of left field.  For example, at one point she lets two strangers talk her into trading a treasured family heirloom for a fertility potion from a Saxon witch.  The scene was shocking because, while we knw Gwen is sad about her barrenness, we never knew she was *that* desperate.  The emotional buildup wasn't there, so her actions were unexpected.<br />However, Guinevere comes out of her shell as a character when she begins to fall in love with Lancelot.  They hadn't always been close.  When Lance first came to Camelot, he was standoffish and rude to her.  She disliked him even though he was a dead ringer for her childhood sweetheart.  But they developed a friendship over the years, and then one fateful night, Lancelot rescues a delirious Guinevere from the tyrannical Maelgwn.  She thinks he spoke words of love during their night ride--but was it just the delirium talking?  A dream?  Or long-denied truth?  Now, Guinevere and Lancelot struggle to figure out a way to acknowledge their love without betraying Arthur.  This book presents perhaps the classiest, most dignified portrait of that romance of any retelling I have ever read, and for that I commend the author highly.  <br />Guinevere has the chance to run away with Lancelot and live happily ever after--but Arthur needs her, and so does her new adopted son, Mordred.  Mordred is Arthur's son by the vulgar and vicious Morgause; after Morgause's death, Guinevere cares for him, though Arthur refuses to get close to the boy.  Guinevere must make tough choices, and nothing will ever be the same again at Camelot.<br />So, although I didn't expect to like this book, I was proven wrong.  I recommend it, especially for the touching portrayal of the Guinevere-Lancelot romance.  See also the third book, _Guinevre: The Legend in Autumn_.	2002-08-14

An innocent young girl and a handsome but arrogant and promiscuous young man fall in love.  After many misunderstandings, and after the couple defeat the Bad Guys, the man changes his ways, and they live happily ever after.  <br />What makes _The Champion_ worth reading, despite its predictability, is the attention to historical detail, painstakingly researched by the author.  Many novels set in the Middle Ages feel like they're set on a Hollywood soundstage, rather than actually in that gritty, violent period.  Chadwick brings the Middle Ages alive, showing us what was beautiful and what was terrible about them.  For example, I never knew before that jousting was actually sort of a professional sport, providing an income for social \\"undesirables\\", and possibly permanent jobs as mercenaries, if a nobleman in the stands was impressed with their skills.  <br />Basically, this is a predictable story with a very rich background.  I wasn't very sucked-in by the characters--they seemed a little flat and stereotypical--but this book is better than its peers because of the research, and I will probably read Chadwick again.	2002-08-12

I reread them every year during the dark nights of January, and they lift me up out of the winter doldrums.  _The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter_ is the exact opposite.  I read it in the middle of July, and it *gave* me a case of the winter doldrums.  Sharyn McCrumb uses lovely prose to drag us into the depths of an Appalachian winter, where the tragedies are as pervasive as the cold.<br />Laura Bruce, the wife of the local minister, is summoned to the home of a family she barely knows, where the oldest son has shot his parents, youngest brother, and himself, leaving the two middle kids (who were out at the time) alive but distraught.  This isn't really a mystery--there is no question as to whodunit, or even why--I guess I've read too many books, but I knew exactly what the family secret was from the very beginning.  The question is, whay will become of the two remaining teenagers now that they are alone in the world?  The law demands a guardian until the older sibling, the boy, reaches 18 in a few months.  Laura Bruce takes on the position, but not the responsibility; she sees it mainly as a formality and doesn't check on them much.  As the winter progresses, Laura becomes preoccupied with her own problems, and completely ignores the teenagers until disaster (quite literally) strikes.  Hello?  Why did Laura marry a minister if she didn't want to assume the social role of a minister's wife?  And why, why, WHY did she agree to become these poor kids' guardian if she wasn't going to even give them a call once in a blue moon?  Yes, I know she has her own problems, but she is almost forty, these kids are in high school, and she accepted the responsibility.  She's an adult, and she doesn't act like one.  I came away from the book not liking Laura much at all.  There is also a subplot about a man dying of cancer who, along with his best friend, plots revenge on the company that is polluting the river.<br />This book is well-written, but so depressing that I probably won't read it again.  If you decide to read it, have a funny book standing by to read afterward.	2002-08-12

The author is a lesbian, and the book contains a gay character. Since mainstream publishers are still a little squeamish about such things, this book gets the label \\"Queer Fantasy\\" slapped on it, gets published by a small press, and the upshot of it is that most straight readers have never heard of the darn thing.  And that's a shame.  This isn't just a good \\"gay book\\", it's a good book.<br />_Through a Brazen Mirror_ fleshes out the ballad \\"The Famous Flower of Serving-Men\\".  It is compelling from the first few pages, wherein a young man stumbles into the King's kitchens during a rainstorm.  He announces he's looking for a job, proclaims his robust health, and promptly faints.  But the young man, William Flower, is more than he seems; his quiet diligence causes him to rise quickly through the ranks of the castle servants, until eventually he comes to the attention of the handsome young King, who is questioning his sexuality.  Meanwhile, in a mysterious tower in the woods, a sorceress has foreseen that her daughter will cause her death.  Since the rules of magic forbid killing one's own blood, the sorceress instead tries to destroy everything around her daughter, releasing plagues and storms upon the land.  I'll warn you right now, don't expect a \\"fairy-tale\\" happy ending; Sherman's ending is sadder but much truer to life than the ballad's original ending.  But she leaves one major plot point open to imagination, softening the tragedy a bit.  And everyone is a little wiser at the end.<br />Delia Sherman writes in a lovely style of prose, atmospheric and somewhat archaic, reminding me of the early books of Patricia McKillip, before her work became more abstract.  The magic in Sherman's world is not cheesy D-and-D stuff; it's the very sort of magic that medieval people actually believed in.  And through it all, even though it's a sad story, Sherman weaves a delightful ribbon of dry humor.  I very much enjoyed this book.	2002-08-12

In my opinion, the stunner of the bunch os Rosemary Edghill's \\"Prince of Exiles\\".  Set among bloodthirsty warlords rather than knights-n-ladies, it is narrated by Ator (Arthur)'s bitter illegitimate son, as he unfolds his intricate plan for revenge against his father.  It's a darkly engrossing story until you get to the last line--at which point it becomes a shocking, chilling, incredible, six-star story.  WOW.  I also enjoyed Tricia Sullivan's \\"The Secret Leaves\\", the romantic tale of young Vivien, who loves and seduces the ethereal Merlin, but eventually loses him to hs shamanistic dreams.  And Judith Tarr's \\"Finding the Grail\\" is best described as \\"sweet\\", a story about a young girl named Melisende who quests for the Grail with the help of the pretty-boy knight Beaumains.  Beaumains hides a secret--and it's not the secret you were expecting.<br />These stories and many others await you.  If you liked _Mists of Avalon_ or any of the wave of women-centric Arthurian novels it inspired, give this book a chance; it's even cheap!  LOL.	2002-08-12

Woolley's Guinevere still has a habit of distancing herself from the story, briskly rattling off the legendary happenings like an anchorwoman for the Camelot Nightly News.  Woolley's desire to tell the Arthurian legend without the use of \\"magic\\" or \\"fantasy\\" still results in cumbersome and byzantine plot devices as the author attempts to explain magical events without the magic.  Her characters still borrow heavily from other authors--Cai is straight out of Phyllis Ann Karr, and Morgan is a twisted reflection of Bradley's Morgaine.  But all of this aside, this is still a good book.<br />In _The Legend in Autumn_, the dream of Camelot begins to fall apart.  There are quarrels--Guinevere and Lancelot fight bitterly over Elaine of Carbonek, whom Lancelot accidentally slept with.  And Mordred, whose best friend is a Saxon captive, comes to believe the Saxons are basically OK, and wants to include them in the Round Table--but Arthur, veteran of countless Saxon wars, holds his old prejudices dear, and refuses his son's request.  And into this tumultuous court comes the young bard Taliesin, singing of the Grail, and the Round Table warriors begin to scatter to the four winds in search of the mysterious object.  <br />Woolley deftly describes the tale told by each returning knight; she does a great job of showing how the Grail means different things to different people, and what sort of meaning each man finds.  (And woman, too, for Guinevere will find her own personal Grail by the end of the story.)  <br />Also wonderfully done was the treatment of Guinevere's punishment for adultery.  The usual retelling shows Arthur standing by heartlessly as his Queen is sentenced to the stake, and Lancelot ruthlessly killing his friends to save her.  Woolley has a more complicated but more believable theory about what reall happened behind the scenes, one that rings true to the characters of the brave Queen, the idealistic King, and the deadly but good-hearted knight.  I won't give it away, but it's good.<br />After Lancelot makes away with Guinevere, they flee to Joyous Gard, where they live simply and happily--until the threat of war looms.  Guinevere is supported by the counsel of Isolde of Cornwall, who has grown wiser since her star-crossed love affair with Tristan, and together they see what must be done.  Far from being the downfall of Camelot, Guinevere will now give her all to save it.<br />This book ought to be remembered, above all, for its sensitive portrayal of the Arthur/Guinevere/Lancelot love triangle.  Gwen and Lance truly have a love for the ages, but Gwen also shares a special bond with Arthur, which holds Camelot together more than they realize.  Guinevere is the human touch that balances Arthur's ideals.	2002-08-10

Kim Headlee puts a new spin on the Arthurian legends with this exciting book.  Borrowing a few key concepts from Norma Lorre Goodrich's truly weird \\"biography\\" of Guinevere, Headlee presents us with a bold new imagining of that legendary figure.  Gyanhumara is her name, and she is the intelligent, resourceful, and brave chieftainess of Clan Argyll, a Caledonian/Pictish tribe.  Her wits are as sharp as her sword as she faces her destiny.<br />Gyan promises to marry the neighboring lord, Urien, to fulfill the terms of a treaty, but her clan's High Priest warns that a Brytonic chieftain will be her death.  Gyan fears her marriage now, but resolves to go through with it.  She also seeks the aid of her clan's gods, but when she receives no response, she begins to turn to the Christian god worshipped by her family's Brytonic slaves.  (In other words, if you can't stand novels where Christians are allowed to be \\"good guys\\", read no further.)<br />Gyan still keeps her resolution regarding the betrothal even when Urien reveals himself to be a chauvinistic jerk, bent on taming Gyan and breaking her to his will.  But her heart is shaken when she meets Arthur Pendragon.  Their chemistry is fierce from the start; moreover, he loves her wild courage and has no intention of trying to change her.  The two fall in love.<br />But Gyan knows breaking her betrothal will provoke war with Urien's clan, so she tries to forget Arthur when she goes away to her schooling on the Isle of Maun, after which she plans to marry Urien.  There, she meets Arthur's haughty sister Morghe, and also the 12-year-old Angusel, who adores her with a little brother's admiration.  When the island is attacked by the Irish, Gyan, Arthur, Urien, Morghe, and Angusel will all be thrown together in the fight to save it.  Legend will be born, and history made.  And much swashbuckling adventure will occur along the way.<br />I hope Headlee plans a sequel, since this book is great fun.  Morghe, Urien, and Cuchullain still have trouble up their sleeves, so the story ain't over yet.  I can't wait to find out how the feisty Gyan faces the challenges of the Arthurian era.	2002-08-10

I'll just tell you why this book has stayed in my memory all this time, despite the fact I don't read much romance, and even less contemporary romance.  <br />The basic story is that Susannah, a restless debutante in the late seventies, flees her society wedding on the back of a Harley driven by a sexy entrepreneur she's known for only a few weeks.  The biker, Sam, is starting a computer business with his two friends, a straitlaced businessman and a \\"geek\\".  Susannah and Sam are joined at the hip for years, but then his dark side comes out, and Susannah begins to see the jerk he really is--and realizes that the real Prince Charming is right in front of her eyes.  Her party-girl sister, Paige, also finds love in an unlikely quarter.<br />Here's what I like about this book, which I think is the same reason other reviewers are griping about it.  It's one of only a handful of romance novels in which the \\"alpha male\\" macho jerk doesn't win the lady in the end.  Most romances have the heroines falling for these violent, promiscuous, impulsive men, and end with the couple riding off into the sunset together, and supposedly this jerk has changed his ways.  Come on, we all know most of those couples will be in divorce court in a year, when the woman realizes that the man is *still* violent, promiscuous, and impulsive.  The guy with the attitude and the flashy clothes is not always the best catch, and this book is a wonderful illustration of that.  It *begins* with the heroine riding off with the macho man, and then we get to see what happens next.  <br />I also liked the detailed research that went into this book's Silicon Valley setting.  Some readers complain that the computer history is too detailed, but personally I prefer novels where the setting is more than a painted backdrop and a trunkful of costumes; novels where the background becomes real.  But that's just me.	2002-08-06

I've finally found an Arthurian novel in which Morgan, Gwenhwyfar, and Morgause are all sympathetic!  Not to mention one with no religious bickering!  (At one point in the book, a pagan knight criticizes a grouchy monk.  Arthur responds, \\"If we judged all religions by their human representatives, they would all be found lacking.\\"  That's the extent of religious debate in this book, and if someone had said it in _Mists of Avalon_, maybe everyone would have wised up a little.)<br /><br />Arthur, hidden away in an obscure village, falls into the hands of an abusive farmer.  One day, his life changes when Merlin, a Roman-type noble of the old school, comes to carry him off to the villa of Avalon, to be raised and taught by Merlin and Ector--and to be trained as the prince he never knew he was.  Though his life is more comfortable now, he is still scarred and withdrawn.  Only Merlin's daughter Morgan, sweet and shy but with remarkable intelligence and emotional courage, can break through his shell and become his friend.  And when they grow up, he falls in love with her, never knowing she is his aunt.  Arthur ascends the throne, planning to make Morgan his queen, but Merlin forbids the match and tells him why.  Arthur is heartbroken.  He wants to defy Merlin, or failing that, to kill himself, but Morgan convinces him to be strong for his kingdom.<br /><br />(Big Snip for Spoilers.)<br /><br />There is something comfortable and comforting about this retelling of the legend.  Why?  I think it's because it never makes you take sides.  It doesn't feel the need to make one of the women sympathetic and the others evil.  It doesn't preach any creed or bash any philosophy.  It's just a love story about real people, with good and bad qualities, all of whom we can understand.  This may not be my favorite Arthurian novel in terms of prose style, but I recommend it. It is beautiful in a simple way, like Morgan in her garden.	2002-08-04

She and her huge family of little sisters have little hope of marriage, since her parents are too poor to dower even one of them, let alone the others.  But word of her mother's fecundity has reached widower Edmund Wyndham, whose first wife died in the birth of a stillborn child after fifteen years of barrenness.  Edmund needs an heir, and he needs a healthy and fertile wife to get one.  He offers to marry Blaze without a dowry, and provide marriage portions to her sisters as well.  The young girl objects, but decided to marry him to help her sisters.  She soon falls in love with her kind and sexy husband, but she's not so sure about arrogant Anthony, his nephew, with whom she constantly bickers in that way that is shorthand for \\"Look out!  Chemistry ahead!\\"  Mostly comfortable in her new life, Blaze bears a daughter.  Unfortunately, Edmund dies, Blaze blames Anthony for the accident that killed him, and Blaze's sister recommends that Blaze go to the royal court for a time to forget her pain.  Instead, she gets blackmailed into being Henry VIII's mistress, then is cast aside when he falls for Anne Boleyn.  Not wanting to leave Blaze helpless, the King wants to make a good marriage for her--and the perfect candidate is good old Anthony.  She still hates him for causing Edmund's accident; he is angry at her for sleeping with the King, but the monarch's word is law, and they marry.  The rest of the book tells the story of how these two people learn to get along, clear up all the misunderstandings, and love each other.  <br />_Blaze Wyndham_ is basically a good story, but there were a couple of things about it I didn't like.  First of all, I hated the scene where Blaze viciously tells off her little daughter over a matter of bad embroidery.  This doesn't sit well with the kindly Blaze we see throughout the rest of the book.   Also, during her marriage to Anthony, there is a subplot involving ateenage villainess, which doesn't seem to serve much purpose except to add pages.  It could have been done without.<br />If you liked this book, and want to read other novels set in the reign of Henry VIII, I recommend Anne Merton Abbey's _Kathryn_ for a more compelling romance, or Philippa Gregory's _The Other Boleyn Girl_ for a darker look at the court.	2002-08-04

Reading over my review, I realized that, despite the fact that I really liked this book, I managed to sound snide without meaning to.<br />Part of the problem is this:  I read a large assortment of the stories in one or two sittings.  I mentioned in my other review that a lot of the stories were similar--of course they are, this is a theme anthology.  Don't make my mistake; don't plow through half the book in one night.  After you've read six stories about kids having life-changing experiences in the woods, they start to run together, and you tend to miss the finer points of each story.  Instead, you're thinking, &quot;OK, here goes another story about a kid lost in the woods.&quot;  So, if you want to get the best experience out of this book, take it slowly and savor it.  All the stories are very good--even the McKillip one I thought was grinding an axe.  (If one can refer to grinding axes when talking about such a tree-positive book...lol.)  Ironically, part of the reason I didn't like Gregory Maguire's story at first is because it was different; wry and satirical rather than personal and emotional like some of the others.  But it's good too; dryly funny.<br />So, in the interest of doing Datlow and Windling's latest anthology justice, I have revised my original review to excise some of the snottiness, and added this second review.  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys D. and W.'s usual blend of enchantment and darkness, and is interested in the age-old motif of going into the wild to learn something.	2002-07-27

How did an unorthodox person such as myself end up reading this? you may ask.  I found it in a 25 cent bin at a library sale.  Sometimes we get surprised.<br />Lynette, the heroine of this book, is a deeply devout young Christian woman.  She just graduated from a prestigious Bible college, where she studied Scripture, Greek, and Hebrew, in order to be the perfect preacher's wife, a complement to her sweetheart, Dana, who has just graduated from seminary.  Now, Lynette starts out as the sort of sickeningly-sweet can-do-no-wrong heroine we all love to hate, but then everything changes.<br />Dana turns out to have become a cynic while away at school; he doesn't really have any faith left, just a desire for adulation and attention.  He's only becoming a minister because that's what everyone expects of him.  And when Lynette comes home, he ignores her in favor of  Jessie Belle, a manipulative, spoiled brat.  Lynette has always done exactly what everyone expected of her--but when Dana snubs her, she drops everything and takes a trip to Europe.  I think that was the moment I decided I liked Lynette--when she made the first self-nurturing decision of her life.<br />Lynette contemplates her life and her faith on her trip, while Dana spirals deeper into trouble with Jessie Belle, all the time blaming Lynette's pride for all of his problems.  In the end, both sow what they reap--Lynette finds someone who can appreciate her abilities and faith, and Dana has to grow up and deal with his mistakes.<br />Though I am of a different religion, I rejoiced to see the intelligent and golden-hearted Lynette rewarded for her faith and spirit.	2002-07-24

Trouble is, it gets bad again after about book 5, _The Fires of Heaven_--the last truly good installment of the series--so I don't know whether to recommend this book or not.  <br />Here goes:  I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a boring prelude to a series that is really good for a while but peters out into insipitude.

Thomas doesn't know why he isn't making any progress with lovely academic Jacqueline Kirby.  Personally, I think it's because he's sort of patronizing, and because he checks out 20-year-olds in front of her face.  But what do I know?<br />Anyway, he invites her to a Ricardian party.  He and a group of friends are avid fans of Richard III, and they are meeting to re-enact their favorite historical characters from the time period of his reign.  As an added bonus, their host, Richard Weldon, promises to reveal a long-lost letter exonerating Richard III of the murders of his nephews.  <br />We meet the guests.  In order to follow the story, we have to remember all of these folks' names--both first and last, since some of them are referred to by their first name in one sentence and their last name in the next.  We also have to remember all their complex soap-operatic relationships.  On top of that, to follow the story, we also have to keep track of which character they are impersonating, *and* how that person died.  All of this, IMHO, is a pretty big outlay of brain cells for a 200-page \\"light read\\".<br />A prankster begins staging fake \\"murders\\" based on the deaths of the various historical figures.  These include such unlikely pranks as knocking a man out, then rigging up a pulley to dangle him headfirst into an empty wine barrel, thus referring to the Duke of Clarence's drowning in a cask of wine.  That's a lot of trouble to go to.  When I got to the end, I couldn't believe the culprit had gone to that much trouble for his/her goal.  Several of the pranks are unrealistically complex.<br />But they escalate, until Thomas and Jacqueline begin to suspect real danger at the manor.  Will they figure out who is behind them before somebody really ends up dead?<br />Overall, this is a contrived, unrealistic mystery which gets way too headache-inducing with all the different names one must remember--and I was *still* able to figure out the culprit fairly early on because onlyone person seemed to have a motive.  I wondered why I had bothered trying to keep track of all the characters.  <br />In addition, the book is fraught with errors:  proofreading errors (\\"King Richarad\\"), editing errors (something referred to on the back cover never actually happens), and continuity errors (a man admires a woman's tan one day, and her aristocratic pallor on the next).  I do not recommend this book.	2002-07-21

I didn't realize, when I found it on a used-bookstore shelf, that it was the first book in a trilogy, and that it only dealt with Guinevere's early life, up until her marriage to Arthur.  The book ends just as the age of glory and pageantry begins.  Unfortunately, since this book didn't pique my interest much, and the other two volumes will probably be a hassle to find, I doubt I'll continue reading this series.<br />Guinevere isn't the simpering fundamentalist you might recall from _The Mists of Avalon_, but neither is she the fascinating character we all want to see her portrayed as.  She is a fairly standard romance heroine, sweet and tomboyish (why does it seem that all heroines these days must be tomboys?) and Generically Nice.  I read through this whole 600-page book about Gwen's upbringing, and didn't learn much about her except that she likes horses.<br />In essence, this is to Guinevere as _Lady of the Forest_ is to Maid Marian--a pleasant romance novel, but nothing groundbreaking.  I'm not the only one who is longing for the perfect portrayal of Guinevere--but this isn't it.	2002-07-21

She is in her early teens, an age when most of her peers are learning a trade, but Mary's late father had insisted that Mary be educated above and beyond the usual schooling of a girl in those times.  And so Mary has no job skills, and hates the idea of becoming a seamstress like her mother.  No, Mary wants to be A Lady.  She wants to wear bright clothes, go to the theater, and never have to drudge.  <br />Her longing for bright clothes leads her to trade a kiss to a peddler for a bright red ribbon--but the peddler basically rapes her, leaving her disgraced and pregnant as the price for the ornament.  Mary's mother kicks her out of the house, and she is taken in by a slightly older woman, a prostitute, whose clothes Mary had admired in the street many a time.  Mary doesn't want to follow her friend's trade--but remember, she has no job skills.  So she becomes a prostitute.<br />Months later, when disaster strikes, Mary can no longer stay in London.  Desperate, she concocts a fake life story and travels to the home of her mother's childhood best friend, Mrs. Jones, also a seamstress.  She tells the woman that her mother is dead, and so is given a servant's position out of pity.  Mary finds love for the first time in this new life, but she can never reconcile herself to being a maid.  The most heartbreaking thing about _Slammerkin_ is that we understand completely why Mary gets so upset whenever anyone scolds her to \\"mind her station\\", and yet we also know her life would be so much easier if she didn't struggle against her destined position.  And so the book marches on to the inevitable tragic ending, as Mary is conflicted between love for her mistress and hatred for being a servant, and between falling in innocent love with a local boy and knowing that she is a diseased prostitute rather than a virginal village maiden.  Frustrated, she turns toher old trade in order to finance her way out of town.  And nothing can help her now.  A true tragedy, as Mary is defeated by her ambition.<br />For a less depressing read, you might also want to read _Forever Amber_ by Kathleen Winsor.  In her ambition, connivery, and impulsiveness, Amber is very similar to Mary--but gets away with most of her schemes.  _Slammerkin_ is more realistic, but quite dark.	2002-07-20

It is set in \\"The City\\", a sort-of London located in an England slightly different from the one in the history we know.  The two major changes are these: First, the monarchy has been abolished and replaced with an elected body.  Second, society is more sexually open and tolerant, and there is no stigma attached to being gay or bisexual.  <br />Our hero, or should I say our anti-hero, is Richard St Vier, swordsman for hire.  He makes his living by fighting duels for nobles who aren't skilled enough to fight their own.  He lives in Riverside, the lower-class ghetto, with his lover Alec, an educated and sarcastic young man who at times betrays hints of noble birth.  Richard gets embroiled in the plots of the nobility, all of them scheming with and against each other, and suddenly he and Alec are both in danger as they end up over their heads in intrigue.  <br />I was about to dismiss _Swordspoint_ as fluff until about two-thirds of the way in.  While it was entertaining, it seemed to be just a soap opera about the schemes and love affairs of a group of shallow, unlikable people.  But as the plot thickens, the best surprises in the novel are in store for us.  We find out just how far Richard will go to save Alec, and vice versa.  Somehow, the amoral assassin and the secretive cynic turn out to be truly in love, and when I found that out, it made both of them twice as sympathetic as they had been before--and I found myself rooting for them.   Is their love strong enough to withstand the machinations of the nobles?  Read on and see, and then at the end you will be rewarded with perhaps the best final paragraph I've read in years--about the messiness of life as contrasted with the tidy endings of fiction.<br />A fun, swashbuckling read for a lazy weekend--it isn't \\"deep\\" or verylong, but it is entertaining.	2002-07-20

Warren Douglas gave us a fascinating look at a Dark Ages world where the nature of magic is shifting along with human philosophies, and where the young girl Pierrette must train in the magical arts in order to save the world from destroying itself.  Her story continues in _The Veil of Years_, which is not the intellectual tour de force that _Pool_ was--since Douglas has already done most of the necessary world-building--but which is more action-laced than its predecessor.<br />Pierrette has saved her sister from the demon that haunted Citharista, but her patron goddess Ma nags her to keep up her work--for the Black Time is still threatening, though she set it back for a brief while.  Pierrette's spirit friends, Guihen and Yan Oors, need her help as well, for they are being reviled by villagers who blame them for the work of malicious ghosts.  <br />The ghosts, it turns out, are issuing from a change of history.  Satan, Eater of Gods, has discovered a historical linchpin at which he can create the world to his own liking--the time of Provence's conquest by Rome.  Already, history books are fading out at that point, for it is now uncertain how history will transpire.  Pierrette journeys back in time and discovers that the ghosts are being created by Druid sorcerers in a last-ditch effort to drive away the Romans.  But only Pierrette knows what the dire consequences of the magic will be--Gaul will be saved from Rome but will lose its soul.  <br />Disguised as a veleda, a prophetess, Pierrette must try to convince both the Romans and the Gauls to hear her warnings.  Along the way, she also has to deal with her own sexual awakening, which threatens her powers of sorcery.  <br />The Sorceress's Tale gains a wider sweep with this book; I'm eager to see Pierrette's battle go worldwide in book three.	2002-07-20

I'll just tell you what I liked and didn't like about _Ombria in Shadow_.<br />What I liked:  The prose was gorgeous.  Much like the author's nearly perfect _Winter Rose_,  this book is like one of those lush dreams that seems more real than reality.   McKillip shows her writing \\"chops\\" off to best advantage in this novel.<br />What I didn't like: The villain was a one-dimensional cliche, and several of the protagonists were just too Nice And Sweet for my taste.  I guess the real gripe is that McKillip spent so much time on her setting that the characters suffered by comparison.  And while several of her other books feature ambiguous situations where you don't know whose side to take, it's clear from page one of _Ombria_ that Domina Pearl has to go.  I prefer my good and evil a little murkier and greyer.  <br />Overall, this book works as a sort of prose poem; read it for the beauty of the writing, and maybe for the interesting concept of the shadow city, but don't expect an epic.	2002-07-19

Yes, a few of the retellings are serious, but most of them are attempts at poking fun at the conventions of fairy tales.  I like these sorts of stories when they are well done, but most of these stories seem to be groaners rather than side-splitters; farces whose main purpose seems to be dragging every single fairy tale cliche into every single story.  I mean, seriously, does a detective story about Rumpelstiltskin, which was just getting interesting, really need Hansel and Gretel barging into the plot?  Many of the stories are like this.  Just throw the ten or so most famous fairy tales into a blender and see what comes out, and top it off with a forced wittiness.  If you're looking for cheesy fairy tale humor, check this out.  Otherwise, look up Datlow and Windling.	2002-07-19

It took me a couple of weeks of sporadic reading to get to that point (maybe 1/3 of the way in), and an day of fanatical reading to finish the rest.   <br />I started the book because I wanted to see what McKillip, with her talent for wordplay and complicated magic, would do to get the \\"Lady of Shalott\\" out of her predicament.  How do you save a woman who will die if she leaves her prison?  But _Tower_ goes far beyond that seed of a story, meandering through subplots that don't seem relevant until the end, weaving a complex tapestry of old grudges, old debts, love, and magic.   For along the way to save the Lady, the knight Cyan Dag must sort out several other problems.  (See the editorial review for a darn good plot summary.)  In the end, _Tower_ is a deeper and more complicated story than it seemed on the surface, and richer than _Ombria in Shadow_ , which is prettily written but relies on cardboard Good and cardboard Evil to carry the plot.  <br />Not quite as enchanting as _Winter Rose_, IMHO, but in the same league as _The Sorceress and the Cygnet_.  Fairly standard McKillip, and \\"standard\\" for her means \\"very good\\".	2002-07-14

First there was matriarchal paganism, then patriarchal paganism, then the coming of Christianity, then reason and science, and each of them affected people's assumptions about how the world works.  In medieval Provence, where all of these belief systems co-exist, a worker of magic never knows for sure who or what she will call up when she casts a spell.  For some spells don't work anymore, and others work in frightening new ways.  And with the rise of Christianity, and the idea that everything is either absolutely good or absolutely evil, the old gods and spirits are in trouble.  They meet one of two fates: They either become prim Christian saints, or are subsumed into the figure of Satan.   Needless to say, the practice of magic is perilous these days, and a sorceress must always be on her toes.<br />Enter Pierrette, an intelligent young girl who sees an apocalyptic vision of the future.  She can only save the world by training to become a sorceress, and _The Sacred Pool_ is the story of her education.  Pierrette must experiment with long-forgotten spells and newfangled science in order to defeat a demon that plagues her sister, and in the long run, to save magic itself from being destroyed.<br />This book starts out slow, but gets interesting once Pierrette begins her studies.  It is thought-provoking and intelligent, and one of the few novels dealing with paganism and Christianity that says anything more profound than that one is \\"good\\" and one is \\"bad\\" (take your pick which is which; there are plenty of books taking each side).  If you like fantasy that makes you think, check out this tale of magic, belief, science, and philosophy.	2002-07-12

So I did.  But I don't think I was reading the stuff she wanted me to read.  Being a melodramatic teenager, I of course zoomed in on the vast violent soap opera that is the book of Genesis.  And my favorite part was the rivalry between Jacob's wives: Leah, Rachel, Bilhah, and Zilpah.  They seemed vibrant and alive to me, as if somehow in the few words said about them, their essence had been accidentally preserved.<br />So of course I read _The Red Tent_.  It's a novel retelling the story of Leah's daughter, Dinah, who is a footnote in the Bible.  According to Scripture, Dinah was raped, and her brothers took bloody revenge.  The hypothesis of this book is that it was not a rape but a forbiddden love affair, referred to as rape by Dinah's male relatives because they could not accept what had really happened.<br />The most interesting part of the book is the beginning, where Dinah recounts the story of her mother and aunts, who were just as vibrant as I wanted them to be.  They loved and envied and bonded in their lives as Jacob's spouses.  And they worshipped a Goddess.  This seems to be the most controversial part of _The Red Tent_.  Everyone is falling all over themselves insisting that those women never worshipped any Goddess.   Actually, if you look at history and the Bible, the Hebrews of the time were constantly going back and forth between condemning the goddess Asherah and worshipping her alongside Yahweh.  It's not at all implausible that the women of the Bible might have worshipped Asherah in secret women's mysteries.<br />Then Dinah grows up, has the love affair, and blood is shed.  This part of the book is also interesting--sexy, sad, and scary--but it is very short.<br />Then Dinah flees to Egypt.  From this point on, my interest lagged.  Maybe because this part wasn't in the story I knew, and Diamant was making it all up, or maybe just because it was less dramatic.  Dinah recovers from her emotional wounds and meets a Generically Nice Guy.  Blah.  :(<br />Four stars for the first third of the book, three for the second, two for the third.

In Bast, Rosemary Edghill creates a delightful heroine with a deep belief in the Goddess and magic--and also with a barbed tongue that deftly skewers the politics and foibles of the Pagan community.  Even if there had been no plot in these three novels, I would have kept reading just to &quot;listen&quot; to Bast talk.  And as an added bonus, there *is* a plot.<br />_Speak Daggers to Her_: An old friend of Bast's dies of seemingly natural causes in her apartment.  Bast discovers that her friend had gotten mixed up in a cult--could this be related?<br />_The Book of Moons_:  Probably my favorite of the three, because of the historical speculation.  Several New York Wiccans find their Books of Shadows missing.  Then, an obnoxious newbie shows up at a picnic brandishing a book he is certain is the BOS of Mary Queen of Scots.  Then someone ends up dead.  How are all these things connected?  Read on...<br />_The Bowl of Night_:  Bast thought the most confusing part of the Samhain retreat would be sharing a cabin with handsome ceremonial magician Julian.  But when a local fundamentalist preacher ends up dead on the campsite, things keep getting weirder...<br />I'm not sure how well these books work *as mysteries*, since the solution is generally not hard to figure out.  I guess I'm just used to the sort of mysteries with 85 red herrings, and no concrete clues until the last two pages, when suddenly the culprit kidnaps the sleuth and reveals the whole plot.  Actually, I find that I like Edghill's more straightforward style better, since the mystery is gradually revealed in layers instead of completely hidden and then suddenly sprung on the reader.  I just want to warn readers of the more usual sort of mysteries that these work a little differently.  <br />As for me, I like them.  I only wish this were an ongoing series.	2002-07-10

He is not  a cad at all; he's one of the most honest and decent characters in the whole book.  He isn't a habitual batterer like some of the other men in this book; he is a loving father; and he is always straight-up with Amber about his intentions.  He never tries to lead her on; she is deluded and keeps hanging on anyway.  I was impressed with him because he's the only character in the whole darn book who is able to see through the fancy clothes and pompous manners of the royal court, and see it (and Amber) as they really are--shallow and false.  <br />Well, anyway, defense of Bruce aside, let me tell you about _Forever Amber_.  It's the story of Amber St. Clare, a teenage girl who has a mostly undeserved reputation as a slut in the boring little town where she lives.  Bruce Carlton, a handsome Cavalier/pirate, rides through town one day, and she sees her chance--she runs away to London with him and becomes his mistress.  When she gets pregnant and he has to leave on business, he gives her some money and advises her to go back to her hometown, because \\"London eats girls like you\\".  Home seems a fate worse than death to Amber, so she stays in London, and does her best to devour the city instead.  <br />City life and hardship toughen her; Amber is scheming, calculating, and ruthless, the kind of woman we all love to hate and hate to love.  She charms and bullies her way through countless husbands and lovers and friends, using them all to her best advantage, until she manages to become the King's mistress and a duchess.  And all the while, she forever carries a torch for Bruce, who pops back into her life once in a while.  He brings out the best in her as she nurses him through the Great Plague.  He also brings out the worst in her--some of her later behavior is the stuff that restraining orders are made of.  He is the only person she doesn't use.  Then she angers some important people, and they cook up a plan for revenge--the sort of justice that makes for devilishly perfect endings...<br />Along the way, we get gobs of information about English life during the Reformation, from the King and his barren queen and his many mistresses, to the old Puritan families who look down their noses at the vanity of the court; to the bawdy world of the theater and the corruption of Newgate Prison.  Other reviewers are right--you'll learn a lot about history by accident, while remaining convinced that you're just reading a guilty-pleasure romance.  Devote a lazy weekend (or three) to Amber.	2002-07-10

Is it a bad sign that I just finished this book the night before last, and now I'm hard-pressed to remember much of the plot?<br />This book's predecessor, _Shadow of Albion_, was fun in a light sort of way, with the promise of sequels that would delve deeper into the faery magic at which it hints.  I should have gotten my first clue about _Leopard in Exile_ when I looked at the cover art.  Thomas Canty's drawings are lovely as always, but this illustration looks like it's supposed to be a rough preliminary sketch, compared to the sublime cover of _Albion_.  Even the typefaces are clunkier.  But I tried not to judge the book by its cover.<br />Inside, though, I found little of interest.  I had hoped that the characters, who were kind of cardboard in _Albion_, would get fleshed out now that we're getting to know them better.  Nope, still cardboard.  It's even worse in this one because people are going around moping about how much they love their husband/wife and yet the relationship has not been developed in the story.  Why do they love each other?  Because the authors say so, I guess.  And to add more frustration, the authors seem to be under the impression that a good plot can be obtained simply by continually landing the characters in danger.  (It reminds me of a 70s bodice-ripper I read years ago, in which the heroine got raped, then shipwrecked on a tropical island, THEN kidnapped by pirates, THEN trapped in an opium den...  You get the idea.)  Dropping the characters into one problem after another works pretty well if we KNOW the characters and CARE what happens to them, but since they're still 2-D, the constant action keeps us from learning any more about them.  It's just crisis after crisis after crisis, and seldom a conversation.  Not to mention, the magic doesn't get explained!  Sarah went to the New World to fulfill a promise to the Fair Folk, but then they were absent for the first nine-tenths of the book, then showed up just long enough to give Sarah some vague aid against the villain, then disappeared again, without any explanation.<br />I don't know if I'll read the third Carolus Rex book.  I know both Norton and Edghill are capable of better books than this.  Let's hope they remember that.	2002-07-10

And in this way, many of the stories are similar, since they have similar themes.<br />However, some of the authors manage to make something fresh and beautiful out of the traditional archetype of kids-lost-in-woods. Delia Sherman contributes a tale of the Faery Queen of Central Park, and the insecure girl who faces her in a battle of wits. Tanith Lee presents probably the darkest of the tales, \\"Among the Leaves So Green\\", about two outcast sisters who each have a special destiny. (This one is probably my favorite--it's pure magic.)  Emma Bull's \\"Joshua Tree\\" is a lovely story about high school, raves, friendship, and mystery. Jane Yolen's poem \\"Cailleach Bheur\\" is terrific.  For these stories and many more, I recommend this book.<br />Of course, in all anthologies, there are disappointing stories. Patricia McKillip's \\"Hunter's Moon\\" seems like a political rant about hunting and meat-eating. And Gregory Maguire fleshes out Jack (of Beanstalk fame), his mom, his brother, and the harp, while somehow managing to avoid making me care about any of them. They're both good stories by good writers--they just weren't to my taste.  The writing is good in all of these stories; there are just a few that aren't for me.	2002-07-02

My Tudor reading binge continues with this immense novel by Margaret George, all of whose books seem to be doorstopper length. The woman seems to have unlimited words in her head. But I digress.<br />_The Autobiography of Henry VIII_ is a fictional \\"what-if\\" positing that maybe Bluff King Hal left a journal behind to tell his side of the story. And as such, this novel succeeds. George's major accomplishment in _Autobiography_ is making us understand some of the seemingly irrational things Henry did--without embellishing the historical record too much. For example, most historians are pretty certain these days that Anne Boleyn did not actually commit adultery and witchcraft. Most novels dealing with the issue show Henry inventing the charges just to get rid of his wife. Here, though, Henry watches Anne dancing and flirting with her male courtiers, and also notices that, for some reason, almost everyone opposed to Anne is suddenly dying. I never thought of that before--maybe Henry really thought she was killing Catherine of Aragon, Mary of Suffolk, etc., with magic. George convinces us he was sincere when he made the charges. She doesn't make anything up; she doesn't invent Anne's guilt. I still wasn't convinced she was guilty. But I can see how the King might have been.<br />What I didn't like about _Autobiography_ was that it seemed somehow imbalanced. Pages and pages and pages are devoted to any ceremony, banquet, or other pageantry. Either the author or the King is obsessed with the details of such occasions. At the same time, emotions are glossed over. The King will say he is in love with someone, after maybe talking to her once, and we are given no clue as to how this emotion cropped up overnight. Lust maybe. But love? The passions that caused him to overhaul the whole country are never made real.<br />And so we have a huge novel that at times seems to be mostly a description of the scenery. It is very good in parts, but I only recommend it to die-hard Tudorphiles (like me). Others will toss it against the wall after the first 20 pages.	2002-07-01

It is the story of the tumultuous reign and disastrous marriages of the young Queen, as told by her female jester, La Jardiniere--born Nicola Ambruzzi, orphan and traveling player.<br />Nicola is given her position as fool just before Mary's husband, the king of France, dies.  Having no reason to stay in France, Mary goes back to her native Scotland and sets herself up as queen.   Nicola goes with her, serving as a courtier, and also as a friend, during the years between Mary's return to Scotland and her exile in England.  <br />The book starts slowly, and is almost but not quite boring until the murder of David Riccio, a close friend of Mary and Nicola.  Then it picks up, starting with a touching scene of Nicola visiting David's grave.  After this beautiful interlude, the real action begins.  Nicola must keep Darnley, Mary's frat-boy husband, from usurping the throne, and later has to help Mary escape from imprisonment on a remote island.  The second half of the book is much more interesting than the first, but I suppose it would have made no sense without the background of the first half.  *shrug*<br />Overall, a decent novel about Queen Mary for middle-schoolers or thereabouts.  It might even encourage you to read more about the Tudor/Stuart period.	2002-06-29

Mary and Anne share a deep bond and a deeper rivalry, born of the fact that their family views them merely as pieces to be played in a great game of social climbing.  Their value is equal only to what sort of advantages they can bring to the family.  Love, marriage, honor?  All are sacrifices to be laid upon the altar of ambition.<br />Sweet, romantic Mary, newly married, catches the eye of the King, and at the urging of the family, leaves her husband and becomes Henry's mistress.  During her pregnancy with the King's bastard son, her family pushes Anne into the King's eye so that he will not stray to a girl from another family.  But Anne, her heart hardened by losing the man she loved, is playing for the crown, not for love or for a few extra estates.  Soon Henry is captivated by the mysterious Anne and will turn the world upside down to have her.  <br />The rest is history, but Gregory manages to keep us reading even though we know exactly what will happen to Anne.  We see the formerly dignified court become a playground for spoiled children once Henry declares that he answers only to himself; we see the handsome and sympathetic Henry become the biggest of the spoiled children himself, growing fat, drunk, and fickle.  We see Anne's high-strung desperation growing to the point of near-madness as she fails to give the King a son, and the doomed and strange relationship between Anne and her brother George.  We witness the King's head turn from maddening Anne to the insufferably sweet Jane Seymour.  And as the whole court goes to hell in a handbasket, we also watch Mary find love with an obscure gentleman farmer.  <br />Anne taunts Mary when she becomes queen; Mary will henceforth be only \\"the other Boleyn girl\\", forgotten by history, while everyone will know Anne's name.  But which is more important? asks this book.  Anne's name is still familiar to schoolchildren, but she lived a desperate life and ended up missing her head.  Mary is barely remembered, and those who do recall her only snicker that she was a trollop too dumb to win marriage from the King, but she lived a life of contentment.  Anne's motto was \\"The Most Happy\\", but perhaps that title must be given to Mary.	2002-06-18
US	49828549	R3RFSG79WF14T5	0553280112	645934683	Kathryn in the Court of Six Queens	Books	5	50	50	N	N	A book fit for a Queen? Maybe...	I was about 14 or 15 when I first read this book; I checked it out from the local library several times, got in trouble with my mom because of the lurid cover, mourned when some other patron checked it out and never brought it back. Firmly believing that _Kathryn_ was The Best Book in the World, I searched for it high and low, and every time I went to a used bookstore, even many years later, I would at least cursorily scan the Romance section to see if I could find this. Thank the Gods for the Internet!<br />Opening _Kathryn_ again was like sitting down at Ye Olde Pub with wonderful old friends--the savvy and ever-surviving Kathryn with her knack for keeping her head--literally--at Henry VIII's court, and John de Gael, the outrageously dressed, rakish pagan lord who delighted in being the only man who dared to argue with King Hal. Having sampled some very fine literature, I no longer hold with the opinion that _Kathryn_ is The Best Book in the World, but even as the years have made me more snobbish about prose style, they have also made me realize just how good _Kathryn_ truly is for its genre--I've read enough historical romances by now to realize that this is a gem among them.<br />First of all, the romance between the leading characters is deeper and more realistic than that found in most romance novels. Most romance novels tell of whirlwind courtships, and end with a hasty wedding taking place while the couple is still in the first throes of infatuation. We never get to see how two people can grow older and wiser together. But Kathryn and John are different. They first fall in love as hormonal young people, but fate and the King separate them. We see them grow stronger through adversity; we smile at the new loves that show them joy again, and when they finally reunite as lovers, it is the triumph of two tenacious and passionate adults, not the whim of a couple of besotted kids. Second, the paganism (which mostly went over my head at 14) is done magnificently. What could have been saccharine and cheesy is instead mysterious, dangerous, and often tragic--think of British sacred/sacrificial king lore here. Finally, _Kathryn_ is notable for its fascinating glimpse into Henry's court. All of the historical personages come vividly alive in Abbey's hands. It was this book, long ago, that sent me off to the History section of the library to figure out what was real and what was fiction. I was heartbroken at first when I found no trace that Kathryn Chase had ever lived, but then I was sucked in by the real history, and to this day my friends tend to think I'm a total weirdo whenever Henry VIII comes up; no one can figure out why I bothered to learn all the little details.<br />So, if you like historical romances, and if you can find a reasonably priced copy of _Kathryn_, don't hesitate to snap it up; it's hard to find these days. Then, pour yourself a glass of the beverage of your choice, find a comfy chair, and prepare to fall in love with Lady Chase.	2002-06-12

A romantic historical novel about Maid Marian and Robin Hood, it was an enjoyable escape and post-work-stress-reliever for a couple of weeks.  I did enjoy it.  Unfortunately, when I shut the back cover, I realized I had just read a six-hundred page book containing almost no surprises.<br />Marion Zimmer Bradley, author of the stellar _Mists of Avalon_, gushes about this book in the cover blurb, and so I was hoping for a novel that would make me rethink the Robin Hood legends, just as Mists made me look at the Arthurian corpus differently.  Part of what made Mists fascinating was that it took an old tale and reexamined it, humanizing the \\"bad guys\\" and telling another side of the story.  Mists questioned all of our assumptions about Arthur and Morgan.  _Lady of Sherwood_ questions nothing, challenges nothing.  The characters are just what we expect them to be... It doesn't rethink the legend any more than does Disney's kids' movie on the same theme.  It may be a nice romance, but it's not in the same league as the best historical fiction.  If you want a romance, you might like this, but for a haunting tale of mysterious forests and renegade Crusaders, go read _The Black Chalice_ by Marie Jakober.	2002-06-10

And they're OK, in general.  I especially liked Viviane's story; I learned more about what made that complex character tick.  Unfortunately, certain details of the history set up by Bradley in _Mists_ were contradicted in _Lady_.  Don't read this if you don't want to get a headache trying to reconcile the two chronologies.  The result of the ritual to enshroud the isle in the mists, as well as the backstory of Taliesin, were altered, along with a few other things.  I suppose I could theorize that Bradley did it on purpose, and we're supposed to assume that the &quot;true story&quot; was changed over time, so that the Mists characters had mistakes in their history.  But the Druids were such meticulous loremasters, I find that difficult to believe.  I think they're just authorial mistakes.  This is better than _The Forest House_, which was overly depressing and had unsympathetic characters, but it sure ain't Mists.	2002-06-05

It is this rotten-at-the-core revelation that is the strongest part of _The Moon and the Sun_.  McIntyre does a stellar job of showing us the falseness of the image of the Sun King's court.<br />Unfortunately, the plot and the characters didn't live up, in my mind, to the gushing blurbs on the back cover.  When reading the novel, I couldn't go three pages without, mysteriously, flashing back to \\"Free Willy\\".  McIntyre, in her afterword, mentions that she originally planned this book as a screenplay; it shows, with plot taking a back seat to spectacle.<br />I could have gotten over the plot, though, had I fallen in love with the characters.  Too bad the most interesting character in the whole book was Madame la Princesse de Palatine, who has a bit part--she was a real historical figure who was married to Louis's gay brother but loved Louis.  She is interesting.  But she's not the central character.  Instead we have Marie-Josephe de la Croix, a paragon of Pollyanna innocence, who is just too perfect to seem real.  And her beloved, Lucien, is such a brown-nosing sycophant that I wanted to slap him.  At the beginning, he slavishly follows King Louis around and thinks of nothing but pleasing him.  Later, he changes his ways--and begins slavishly following Marie-Josephe around instead, and thinking of nothing but pleasing her.  The man never gets a backbone of his own.  And he was always so bad-tempered that I couldn't like him.<br />The book was successful in that it inspired me to go read more on the history of the period, but I wouldn't recommend it especially highly unless you're interested in that period. The story doesn't really stand apart from the historical scenery.	2002-05-31

Seductive, serpentine, and deadly, they are succubi and vampires, draining blood and vitality from their hosts even as they inspire them to creativity.  One of these beings attaches itself to Byron and Shelley's circle of expatriate poets, and the drama begins.<br />We see this through the eyes of gynecologist Michael Crawford, who gets drunk and puts his wedding ring on a statue's hand at the bachelor party--and finds his wife murdered the morning after the wedding, in a scene reminiscent, probably intentionally, of Dr. Frankenstein's wedding night.  Suspected of the murder, he flees to the Continent, where he becomes Byron's personal doctor.  Traveling with the controversial lord, he will become entangled with poets, wannabe poets, fetishists who *want* to be vampire victims, and the mentally ill sister of his dead wife, who wants to see him dead.  Along the way, he learns more about the creature to whom he is \\"married\\", and tries to break his ties to it, as mysterious deaths begin to occur.  <br />This is a creepy and atmospheric novel that I could not put down.  I read at night until I couldn't stay awake any longer, then got up and read in the morning.  This is an enthralling novel of ancient evil, troubled love, birth, and death, which will stay with you.	2002-05-19

Well, at least I think it's a good book.  It is also a quick read.  I would call it short and sweet, but it might be more accurate to call it short and bitter, since the author is definitely riled up about her subject.<br />The subject is reproductive issues.  Unlike other books and articles, which usually deal with one issue at a time, _The Wandering Uterus_ looks at the interconnections, revealing that issues don't exist in a vacuum.  Think about this:  Are you pro-choice?  Do you also believe in prosecuting women who use drugs when they're pregnant?  See the contradiction, when you look more closely?  We learn, from this book, that whenever the female body becomes the subject of political debate, we need to keep our eyes open for hidden agendas.  None of these issues are as simple as they look.  <br />Unless you're very interested in the subject, you might want to buy this used, or get it from the library, but certainly it's worth reading.	2002-05-14

Anne of Cleves is often remembered as the least interesting of Henry VIII's six wives, repudiated for her lack of beauty, passively accepting a spinster's life.  Personally, I've always liked her, ever since reading Anne Merton Abbey's _Kathryn_ in my teen years (if you can find it, buy it!).  In that book, Anne was cleverer than she seemed, playing along with Henry's wishes in order to gain her freedom and a life on her own terms.  And in this novel, I have found another such reading of her.<br />Anne, in this book, is a shy German lady, brought up in austerity, unused to dancing and flashy dresses.  It is her lack of what Henry thinks of as \\"culture\\", not her actual looks, that turn him off.  He sees her as awkward and prim, and besides, he has already fallen in heat with Anne's cute teenage lady-in-waiting, Catherine Howard.  The author's treatment of Catherine is another delight. ... Catherine is a naive adolescent, maneuvered into the King's path by her scheming relatives, then abandoned by those relatives when she was no longer in favor.  Her affair with Culpepper is touching, and the unlikely friendship that grows between her and Anne is even more so.  We may never know exactly what sort of women Anne and Catherine really were, but one can dream that Barnes's wonderful characters were close to the truth.<br />Anne outlives Catherine, Henry, and the painter Holbein, with whom she has a fascinating platonic romance, and in the end finds herself more loved than she had ever imagined.  Barnes has done a great job of fleshing out this obscure lady and bringing her to life.	2002-05-14

However, I think he was trying too hard to write a Big Literary Novel with this one, and lost some of his usual touch of enchantment along the way.<br />Mostly, this is a depressing novel. The humans are jerks to each other, the gods are jerks to the humans and to each other. I won't summarize the plot, since the editorial review covers that. I'll just say that this book, while well-written and occasionally funny, is essentially made up of gloom-n-doom punctuated by cruelty and violence. I read chapter after chapter of misery, and then reached the anticlimactic ending.<br />In addition, the gods don't, for the most part, seem very *magical*.  That seems to be the point--they've been reduced to almost human lows--but I guess I expected more mystery and magic out of a story about the wars among the gods.<br />Zorya Vechernaya, the lady of the Evening Star, is an exception--her character just oozes the mystery lacking in many of the others.  Another good touch is the small town in which Shadow lives during the story; its surface placidity and dark secrets are wonderfully done.<br />Overall, though, this is a very well-written book, but leaves you with a very \\"down\\" feeling.	2002-05-14

Well, yes, it's light, but that's part of what I liked about it.  I've read a lot of serious (and sometimes depressing) books lately, and this one was a much-needed cool breeze of just plain fun.<br />The Marchioness of Roxbury, a vain and vapid woman, is on her deathbed, having failed to fulfill a promise made to the Fair Folk.  She lives in an alternate England where magic exists, though it's subtle.  The only way she can keep her word is by switching places with Sarah Cunningham, her double from our world, an independent woman who was raised in the wilderness and knows her way around a musket.  Sarah's memories are jumbled by magic, and now she has to figure out who she is.<br />She and her new husband, Wessex, get caught up in a deadly game of espionage, kidnapping, and murder.  When Sarah becomes friends with the Crown Prince's new sweetheart, the game gets even deeper.  Danger, betrayal, and unexpected allies are around every corner.  While the love story between Sarah and Wessex is never developed really well, the adventure is fun and movie-like, and the end leaves me wanting more.  Gotta go read the sequel now.	2002-05-14
US	49828549	R2RSF5NSW9KZZ2	0671014196	624491085	The Summerhouse	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A bittersweet summer read	The only major complaint I have about Jude Deveraux's _The Summerhouse_ is this:  Now that Jude Deveraux has written it, I can't write it.  I've been obsessed with alternate pasts/futures ever since I saw the Back to the Future movies as a kid.  I loved the movie Sliding Doors, years later.  So, of course, I enjoyed this fairy tale of three women who get the chance to change their pasts and find out how the present would have been different.<br />Leslie, Ellie, and Madison are middle-aged and unhappy; all of them wonder whether they could have avoided their present problems by making different decisions in the distant past.  They are all led to the mysterious psychic Madame Zoya, who offers them an incredible chance.  Each woman gets to return to the past for a three-week period of her own choosing.  At the end of three weeks, she will find herself again in Zoya's parlor, with the knowledge of both the known life and the &quot;alternate&quot; one.  She can then choose which life she wants, with the option to remember or forget &quot;the road not taken&quot;.<br />Admittedly, this novel is a romance novel, and as such, falls into a few old romance cliches.  Inner transformations often are heralded by weight fluctuations or new hairstyles.  And even the &quot;good&quot; men have slight chauvinistic streaks.  <br />But, all in all, I enjoyed this book.  It was light reading and yet thought-provoking.  You might shed a tear or two, and you will certainly consider, afterwards, which three weeks *you* would choose, in your own life.	2002-05-11
US	49828549	R2HIO7LFNK765U	0743424387	241186551	The Meeting of the Waters (Watchers (Pocket))	Books	2	7	9	N	N	How can a swashbuckling Celtic epic be BORING?!?	With its gorgeous knotwork cover art and the back-cover blurb about &quot;brave, copper-haired Aoife&quot;, the publishers evidently mean to recommend this book to readers who've read and loved Marillier's Sevenwaters series, the popular trilogy of Celtic epics featuring strong female protagonists.  That's why I bought this book myself.  I expected a similar sort of Irish-sword-and-sorcery adventure, complete with love and war and magic.  The setting is the time of the Gaelic conquest of Ireland, among the Danaan and Fir Bolg tribes who resist the invasion.<br />Unfortunately, for about the first 500 pages of this book, the love and war and magic are there, but seen from a distance.  It's as if _Daughter of the Forest_ had been told from the POV of the cook Janis, or something.  We never get to know any of the lead characters very well, and most of them are unsympathetic.  Aoife is a spoiled brat, and a minor character to boot.  Her father, King Brocan of the Fir Bolg, is insufferably stubborn; Queen Riona lives only to humiliate her husband.  Of their two sons, one is dull and the other foolish and gullible.  On top of everything else, most of the exciting events take place &quot;offstage&quot; during these first 500 pages.  Mostly, we see the characters arguing about the events in the mead-hall.  So, for 500 pages, a bunch of jerks sit around and bicker, and refuse to actually get anything done, for fear of accidentally benefiting their old rivals, the Danaan.  At one point, the &quot;wise&quot; Druid judge assigned to deal with the situation comes up with a solution that could make the Danaan and Fir Bolg work together.  I, the reader, had thought of it some 100 pages earlier.  And I'm no all-wise Druid.  I spent most of the book yelling at the characters to grow up.<br />It gets a little better.  In the last hundred or so pages. the characters spend a truly creepy night in a Fomorian wood, and after that there is a battle.  However, the result is sort of anticlimactic; if feels like we could have gotten there several hundred pages ago.<br />And by the way, how does the Quicken tree work?  At the beginning, it was said that its berries would provide immortality *only* if the user consumed them once a year for the rest of his/her life.  By the end of the book, Mor seems to have forgotten that, and the berries confer instant immortality on anyone who takes them.  It changes the meaning of the ending quite a lot.  <br />I'm a little sorry to allow the first (and so far only) review on this page to be negative, but I just thought this book was grating.  Maybe someone else will enjoy Caiseal Mor's style, but it just isn't for me.	2002-05-11

I was not able to finish it.  It flunked the Finish-able Book Test, which means that if I put it down for a couple of days and find no desire to pick it back up, I don't bother wasting my time.<br />Shannon, a schoolteacher from Oklahoma, gets zapped by magic into the mythical world of Partholan, where she ends up worshipped as a priestess, married to an attractive shapeshifter, and embroiled in a war with the truly nasty and evil Fomorians.  I liked the premise.  Unfortunately, the cover blurb was more interesting than the actual novel.<br />First of all, the mythology is sloppy as heck.  I tried to get over this, accept that the book is a comedy loosely based on mythology, but it still bugged me that Cast can't keep her folklore straight.  Priestesses of Epona are mixed with Greek-style nymphs and centaurs.  The result is that the  book ends up feeling shallow rather than deep, fluffy rather than rooted in an ancient mythology.  I wouldn't have minded if she had made up her own mythology.  It was the myth-in-a-blender that gave me a headache.<br />And speaking of shallow, the heroine seems unable to endure a single page of text without brooding about her weight or her hair.  I can understand doing a little bit of this--it makes her seem more real at first.  However, you'd think that after a few days in the mythical world, she would have figured out there are bigger concerns than whether her thighs are fat.  I've already seen Bridget Jones. <br />I guess this book isn't bad, per se--it just didn't interest me all that much.	2002-05-01
US	49828549	R351H4A79HS44G	0380812525	135421562	Ritual of Proof	Books	2	26	32	N	N	A good concept doth not a good novel make.	_Ritual of Proof_ intrigued me, based on the cover blurb and a brief thumbing-through in the store.  \\"Ah,\\" I thought, \\"here is a good concept; it's bound to be a good book.\\"    The concept is this: women travelers from Earth settled, centuries ago, on the moon of Forus, where they set up a society where women ruled, and then used genetic engineering to create men for pleasure and reproduction.  Set in this world, long after its founding, is the love story of Green Tamryn, a titled lady, and her chosen name-bearer (husband, except that in this world the man takes the woman's name), Jorlan.  Jorlan is a rebel, convinced that males should be allowed an equal place in society.  He marries Green, both because he has no real choice and because he secretly desires her.  Yet he remains committed to changing the world.  Sounds pretty good, huh?    Unfortunately, _Ritual of Proof_ falls down on two levels, and given its flaws I found it impossible to finish.  First, the society the author sets up doesn't make much sense.  Dara Joy seems to have set up a society that was the exact mirror image of Regency society, rather than pondering what a woman-ruled world really would be like.  I'm not referring to any maudlin notions that women are the gentler sex, and wouldn't be so oppressive.  I'm talking pragmatic stuff here.  There is a reason why patriarchal culture became so obsessed with the chastity of brides.  It wasn't because they consciously decided \\"Hey, let's oppress some women.\\"  It was because they wanted to make sure their heirs were really their children, that they weren't passing on their names and their fortunes to someone else's kids.  When a child is born, it's pretty obvious who its mother is.  Its father, in the days before genetic testing, would be less clear.  Thus, women were expected to be virgins at their marriage and faithful ever after.  But in Joy's world, males have been genetically engineered to grow a hymen over their genitalia, and must display it before witnesses to prove their virginity at the time of marriage.  This is said to ensure the purity of the man's wife's bloodline.  Huh?  First of all, this society is more concerned with the maternity of a child than the paternity.  The man just provides the sperm.  Any child born of a certain woman's body is hers, by common sense.  And if they're so concerned about paternity, they can do paternity testing.  This is a world where everything is based on genetic engineering!  Is it plausible that they don't know how to do a paternity test?  The foundation of the plot, the \\"Ritual of Proof\\" of virginity, is utterly pointless.  Joy was clearly more interested in turning sexism upside down than in designing a world that made sense.    Second, the prose is awkward.  When the writing is a pain to read, it becomes hard to care about the characters.  They can never seem more than words on a page, when the style is as messy as this.  Ever heard of \\"As you already know\\" dialogue?  That's where the characters sit around talking about stuff they all know already, just because the author can't think of any other way to impart that info to the reader.  Heard of info-dumping?  In historical fiction, it's what happens when the author decided to show off her research by launching into dry historical detail at the expense of plot; in this case, the author is launching into dry made-up detail about her invented world.  The world of Forus is bigger than this book; if she wants to tell us all about it, she should have written more than one book about it rathet than trying to cram the history of a planet into a romance novel.  And, of course, we have the tried-and-true telling-not-showing.  Joy wants us to think of Green as a strong and intelligent woman.  How does she indicate this?  By saying that Green is a strong and intelligent woman.  Ditto for the descriptions of Jorlan as rebellious, willful, and psychically gifted.  Instead of showing us the characters through the story, we're just told what they're like and that's that.    Like I said, I couldn't finish this.  The sex is pretty steamy; it might be worth reading for that.  Don't approach it looking for insightful world-building, or much in the way of feminism.	2002-04-30

Thousands of Greeks lined up to receive initiation year after year, and afterward they raved of a beatific vision that completely dispelled their fear of death.  But they were sworn to secrecy about the things they saw in the Goddesses' temple, and so there are no records explicitly saying what happened there.  Many scholars have studied the Mysteries, and at the end of their essays thrown up their hands, figuratively, and saying there is no way we will ever know what the revelation was.<br />Kerenyi does a wonderful job, in this scholarly book, of trying to put his finger on the nature of the vision.  He starts by ruling out things that it could not have been.  Poetic sources vividly describe the abduction of Persephone/Kore, and her return to her mother.  There were no secrets there.  Thus, the Mysteries must not have centered around either of these events.  He then uses archaeological and literary evidence to piece together a surmise about what the Mysteries really were.  So many little things, in Kerenyi's hands, add up to become significant.  Why won't Demeter drink wine during her mourning period?  What is the meaning behind the scene where she puts the boy in the fire to make him immortal?  What about tantalizing poetic hints that Demeter, like earlier mother goddesses, might have descended to the underworld herself in search of her daughter?<br />In the end, Kerenyi's theory works quite well.  The Mysteries could very well have been much like what he describes.  And yet, even if he's right, there is still something mysterious about the whole production.  We might have finally figured out what the priests and priestesses of Eleusis showed to the initiates.But we have to use our imaginations to recreate the feeling it must have given them, the meaning it must have held, in a less cynical age than our own.	2002-04-25

I began looking into yoga because my back and legs hurt constantly after standing up at work all day. Most of the books on the subject out there seemed to be either too difficult or else plagued by a condescending writing style. This was the exception. It looked approachable--not too many exercises that just looked flat-out impossible. So I bought it and took it home. That was about three weeks ago.<br />My back doesn't hurt anymore. My legs don't hurt anymore. If they feel a little achy after work, I just go home, do a little bit of yoga, and voila! instant relief. In addition to the post-work relaxation, I've taken to doing a longer yoga workout every other day for general fitness. I started by just working my way through the beginning stretches, and have been adding advanced poses as I felt comfortable with them. I feel great, and as a side effect, I am gaining some muscle tone, and my figure looks better. I haven't lost any pounds per se, but my clothes fit much better. How great is that? I've finally found an exercise that feels good and is also good for me. I think I'll be sticking with this. <br />Trivell's book is very useful. She provides two sections of stretches--beginning and advanced--and then gives us ideas for how to combine them into workouts for those days when we don't have time to go through all the exercises. There are sections detailing which poses are good for different areas of the body, so you can focus on your weak points. There are 10 and 20 minute routines; there is a morning \\"wake-up\\" routine and an evening \\"destressing\\" routine. Everything about this book is approachable and down-to-earth. I love it. If you're a beginner to yoga, this is the bomb! Then, once this is old hat to you, you can maybe check out one of the other books, the ones that looked intimidating not that long ago.	2002-04-19
US	49828549	R1P14GOZCR53CP	1568581939	503016189	Here Comes the Bride: Women, Weddings, and the Marriage Mystique	Books	3	14	15	N	N	Some good points, with an underlying bitterness	In _Here Comes the Bride_, Jaclyn Geller attacks modern \\"wedding culture\\", from staged proposals to thousand-dollar white gowns to the forced sexiness of the honeymoon, and ties modern traditions back to the marriage customs of old, in which women were a commodity sold between father and husband.  She asks us, why do we still get married, when the institution is a relic of a sexist past?  Why do the invitations still hint at the bride being \\"given\\" by her parents?  Why do brides get so many gifts lavished upon them?  Many good questions are raised.  However, for several reasons, the book left a sour taste in my mouth.<br />First, Geller seems too close to her subject, perhaps a bit too personally bitter about it.  Maybe she should have left out the personal anecdotes--she comes off sounding like she is just mad because her married friends are drifting away from her, and because nobody is throwing her a spinsterhood shower and giving her loot.  There's a good point here.  Married folks are much better off if they hang on to their old friends and don't retreat into a cocoon of coupledom.  And maybe we'd all be better off if our relatives helped us get started in our first \\"place of our own\\", whether we entered it as single or married people.  It's just that she sounds so shrill on these points that it makes her polemic sound more like a personal whine than a political statement.<br />Second, and this didn't jump out at me at first, but was pointed out in a wonderful review on Salon.com, Geller doesn't interview any brides!  She never asks any engaged or married people why they're taking this step, whether they feel \\"oppressed\\", etc.  (In my own experience, most people who marry have already been living with their lover for years, and get married to please the parents.  They already consider this person the most important in their lives; the ceremony is just an antiquated formality.  This puts the lie to Geller's thesis that marriage artificially creates closeness between husband and wife.)  Her lack of personal stories makes the whole thing ring rather hollow, in retrospect.  When Betty Friedan wrote _The Feminine Mystique_, she interviewed many housewives and quoted them to show their discontent.  <br />And so, without any personal testimony on the subject of marriage, Geller is left analyzing pop culture.  She lambasts self-help \\"get-a-man\\" manuals, bridal magazines that recommend lavish and expensive nuptials, and the fascination with celebrity wives, who are always asserting that they're \\"traditional\\" wives and mothers despite the fact that they have full-time nannies and probably never even *see* their kids unless they have a photo shoot together.  All of this stuff, I agree, is obnoxious as heck!  But what Geller never challenges is the assumption that these things reflect the true feelings of the average woman.  Most women I know, married or otherwise, think big weddings are just displays of wealth, that \\"celebrity wife\\" stories are sexist and annoying, and that dating manuals are the best way to ruin your relationship by analyzing it into oblivion.  In _Backlash_, Susan Faludi exposed the \\"nesting\\" culture of the eighties as something cooked up by the media, not an actual trend among regular people.  What if this marriage culture is the same way?  Geller never finds out, since she doesn't talk to the brides themselves, whether women getting married really feel the way she thinks they do.<br />This book is a remarkable expose' of the marriage culture, but really doesn't say a darn thing about actual marriage. So go ahead and toss those bridal magazines, but don't let this book sway you too much about whether to tie the knot at all.  That's up to you.  Geller says it's not OK to be married, but we never do find out why.	2002-04-18
US	49828549	R15MKEKWKBROFJ	0441008968	374275778	The Black Chalice	Books	4	5	6	N	N	It's a rant, but it's good anyway.	First of all, if you were offended by the anti-Christian sentiments expressed in _The Mists of Avalon_, read no further.  In that book, there was some balance--there were sympathetic and unsympathetic characters in both the Christian and pagan camps.  In _The Black Chalice_, there are only a few likable characters, and they're all either pagan or nonreligious.<br />However, if you can accept that the Christian church committed some atrocities in its past, this is a pretty good book.  Set in a sort-of-fictionalized medieval Germany, this is a blistering historical novel exposing the corruption that fueled the Inquisition and the excesses of the Crusades.  Our hero is Karelian, who gained fame in the fight for Jerusalem, but lost his faith when faced with human cruelty.  He is entreated by a powerful pagan priestess, the half-faery Raven who dwells in an Otherworldly castle deep in the forest, to help her battle an ambitious duke who would be king.  At first Karelian is swayed by lust, but as time goes by, he finds meaning in the pagan beliefs and in his deepening love for Raven.  As all his former allies become convinced that he is \\"fallen\\" and \\"evil\\", Karelian gets the chance to be a true hero--even if it means being remembered as a Satanist sorcerer.<br />His adversary, Duke Gottfried, believes himself to be the direct blood descendant of Jesus, and has charisma, popularity, and a strange magical relic on his side.  Karelian also must contend with Paul, Karelian's own squire, who believes in Gottfried's claims.<br />Much of the story is told by Paul, remembering it all as he spends his last years in a monastery.  Paul is a interesting if utterly contemptible character; we can sort of understand where he's coming from even as we want to throttle him.  Paul is basically a product of his times.  He is sexist, anti-pagan, disgusted by anything unfamiliar.  In particular, he abhors sex--mainly because his own proclivities, he has been told, are the lowest of abominations.  Driven by his cultural upbringing, by frustrated love, and by religious fervor, Paul has to make a difficult decision in this conflict, and the results are shocking.  I thought I knew exactly how this story would end, and I still gaped as I read the final few chapters.   <br />Besides _The Mists of Avalon_, I would compare it to two more recent reads, Carey's _Kushiel's Dart_ and Marillier's Sevenwaters books.  The settings are different, but they are all epic historical fantasies full of bloody wars, sensuality, and religious conflict.  Recommended if you like that sort of thing.	2002-04-17

I recently decided to take up yoga to ease aches and pains incurred by standing up all day at work, and also to get some muscle tone.  This book was my first, and I didn't last long with it.  Lots of reviewers have mentioned its good points here, so I'll just voice my dissenting points.  And so, without further ado, this is why I didn't like this book...<br />(1) Hittleman has a condescending and dictatorial writing style that I do not like.  He keeps on drumming it into our heads that we must follow his routines *exactly* as written, but never explains why.  The result is that we end up irrationally afraid of injury if we deviate at all from his plan.  He doesn't explain anything about &quot;balancing&quot; the workout by alternating backward and forward bends, or anything like that.  he just gives us the routine and says, basically, do it this way or else.  Some days I would have back pain, and the day's routine didn't include any back exercises.  I wanted to add to the routine but was worried something bad would happen, since Hittleman hadn't explained the logic behind the design of the workouts.<br />(2) Hittleman rarely tells us what muscles we are supposed to be working with any given exercise.  Yeah, maybe women in the late sixties were not expected to know the names for their muscles, but I would certainly have appreciated more detail than &quot;your legs&quot; or &quot;your waistline&quot;.  How am I supposed to know if I'm doing the exercise correctly if I don't know where I'm supposed to feel the &quot;pull&quot;?<br />(3) Insulting tripe like the &quot;Scalp Exercise&quot;.  This is not an exercise.  It consists of pulling at your hair for a minute or so.  Yes, it's pleasurable, but it's not an exercise, and I don't want to waste my workout time playing with my hair.<br />(4) Awkward design of workouts.  The way the routines are set up, you go through and do each exercise once, then go through and do each exercise a few more times, then start all over and do each exercise in succession *again*, this time in a slow-motion &quot;dance&quot; routine style.  What is the point of ending the routine with a relaxing, lying-down move if we just have to get up and repeat the darn thing two more times?  If I'm going to do three reps of something, I'd rather do them all at once, before moving on to the next exercise.<br />(5) The disturbing admonition to eat as little as possible.  Hello?  We are not Highly Evolved Mystics who can sit on top of a mountain and subsist on air for the rest of our lives.  We need to eat FOOD or we will end up in the HOSPITAL.  I understand that we should try to eat sensibly, but Hittleman's extreme advice bothers me and scares me.<br />After a brief period working with this book, I decided (a) that I wanted to continue in yoga, and (b) that I needed a different book to do it.  I'm currently working my way through Lisa Trivell's _I Can't Believe It's Yoga_.  And I'll be sure to review it once I've formed my opinion on it!	2002-04-10

In _Daughter_, the heroes and villains were clearly delineated; in _Son_ the line between the two was more hazy, but the heroine herself was beyond reproach.  In _Child_ the heroine, Fainne, is a conflicted and flawed character in ways that Sorcha and Liadan never were.  <br />Fainne, child of the forbidden union of Ciaran and Niamh, is raised by her father in the lonely reaches of Kerry.  When her father falls ill, Fainne's grandmother, the evil Oonagh, takes Fainne under her wing.  The sorceress has a diabolical plan that will destroy all of the good of Sevenwaters, and Fainne is to be her tool.  Through threats and emotional blackmail, she presses the girl into her service; through trickery, she causes Fainne to do some truly terrible things.  Fainne feels she is destined to be forever evil and forever alone, and so she does not fight back--until the people of Sevenwaters reach out to her, and she begins to understand love and family.  \\"You forget,\\" says one character, \\"that every girl has two grandmothers.\\"  <br />Once Fainne begins to grow a spine, the dark and depressing narrative turns passionate and exciting.  How can she carry out Oonagh's scheme?  Is it possible to fight her?  How strong can Fainne be?  <br />Again, while this is not the romantic \\"fairy tale\\" of _Daughter_, it is an engaging story and a fitting ending to the Sevenwaters saga.  Fainne is much more than she seems.  If you can get through the first half of the book, you'll love the second half.	2002-04-10

One, &quot;A Knot of Tears&quot;, is a story about storytelling; the other, &quot;Rusina, Not Quite in Love&quot;, is a Beauty and the Beast tale.<br />In &quot;A Knot of Tears&quot;, the lovely Costanza, recovering from a vaguely hinted betrayal, has shut herself away from the world for a while, and is just beignning to feel stifled by her self-imposed isolation.  As two wealthy suitors plot and scheme as to how they can get her to come out of her house, Costanza finds something much deeper with a young sailor who tells her a serial fairy tale about a strong heroine, which turns out to parallel Costanza's own life in interesting ways.  A well-written novella about the power of a good story and about coming out of depression.<br />In &quot;Rusina, Not Quite in Love&quot;, Rusina becomes companion to an eccentric elderly couple, and befriends their ugly and reclusive nephew, Sebastian.  From her new family, Rusina learns about the beauty to be found in nature and art, and yet has trouble coming to terms with Sebastian's inner beauty and outer ugliness, even as the two become friends.

There is a wide variety of \\"types\\" of story here, from fantasy to horror to mystery to wildly hilarious comedy.  I liked almost all of them.<br />Neil Gaiman's two finest gifts are (1) humor, and (2) truly scary horror that gets under your skin rather than just grossing you out with gore.  He flexes his humor muscles with such outstanding fare as \\"Chivalry\\" (the story of an old woman who buys the Holy Grail at a thrift shop), \\"We Can Get Them For You Wholesale\\" (about hit men with discount rates), \\"One Life, Furnished in Early Moorcock\\" (about a young boy and his love for fantasy novels), and \\"Shoggoth's Old Peculiar\\" (believe it or not, a *funny* Cthulhu story, about strange towns, getting drunk, and Things that live under the ocean).  <br />As for horror, there is the story in the intro, \\"The Wedding Present\\", which is sort of a \\"Marriage of Dorian Gray\\", plus several other standouts including two of the narrative poems, \\"The White Road\\" (a montage of Bluebeard tales) and another, whose name I forget, about a woman who is vanished by a magician and _never reappears_.  Truly creepy and hauntingly sad as well.  <br />I could sit on this computer for another hour listing good stories from this collection; however, you'd do better just to buy the book.  If you like psychological horror, dry humor, or anything of the sort, you'll love this.	2002-04-02
US	49828549	R15C3TG5BEF4DV	0765342987	615549012	Kushiel's Dart	Books	4	11	13	N	N	A shattering novel of pleasure and pain	This is the story of Phedre, marked as a masochist by the angel of pain and punishment, and trained from youth as a courtesan and spy.  The book follows her through her childhood and then the vicissitudes of one fateful year, in which Phedre learns more about pain and love than she had ever dreamed possible.  Tragedy strikes her comfortable life, and she is sold into slavery among the Skaldi (Vikings), and must use her talents and her wits to survive.  The Skaldi plot to take over Phedre's home country of Terre d'Ange, and Phedre is stunned by the fact that several nobles she knows are complicit in the plot.  She escapes to warn her Queen, but finds herself assigned to a dangerous mission in Alba (Britain), which will further test her skills and her emotional strength.  The climax comes with a battle scene almost as adrenaline-laced as the siege of Minas Tirith, and _Kushiel's Dart_ ends with the aftermath.<br />I don't think I understood the depth of Carey's novel until I finished it.  Pleasure and pain are forever mingled in Phedre's life, but it goes far beyond the bedroom.  Terre d'Ange may have won a great victory, but we are never allowed to forget those who died to make it possible.  Many fantasy novels focus on the triumph of the nobility while seeming to forget the commoner blood spilled to achieve the nobles' goals.  This is not one of them.  War in Carey's world is always a tragedy, no matter who wins, because there are good and bad people on all sides, and because the dead are made real to us instead of just pawns on the chessboard.  Love, too, is a double-edged sword.  What if you found the bravest, kindest, most loyal man you could possibly desire, but could never be satisfied with him because he could not satisfy your darkest proclivities?  And what if you knew you would forever long for a cruel traitor who had the blood of your family on her hands, but who was the only one who truly understood your cravings?  Love and pain are never far apart.  By the end of the book, we've all been pricked by Kushiel's dart.<br />One caveat:  Before you read this book, make sure to check out the number of pages!  _Kushiel's Dart_ is forbiddingly long and relentlessly serious; I could only read a few chapters at a time before becoming overwhelmed and setting it aside for lighter reading.  However, Carey's plot was interesting enough that I never left the book sitting idle for more than a day or so.  Very good, though long.	2002-03-23
US	49828549	R16J5YBZTGZDNM	0380732289	738418097	The China Garden	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A maze of secrets	Recent high-school graduate Clare thinks she knows what her future holds--college, and her popular boyfriend whose callousness is clear to everyone but her.  But when her mother announces she is moving to Ravensmere Manor to care for her ailing grandfather, in payment of a mysterious debt, Clare feels in her gut that she, too, must go there.  Clare comes to find that her family is an ancient one, entrusted with a sacred duty and marred by generations of tragedy.  She comes to fall in love with the manor, and plans to do anything in her power to save it from destruction.  Along the way, she also learns she has the second sight, and falls in love with the stubborn and brooding Mark, who also has a part to play in the story of Ravensmere.  <br />_The China Garden_ unfolds slowly,  as Clare learns the truth about her family's past and her own destiny, piece by piece.  Suddenly, I realized I was hooked, and could not put the book down until the secret was revealed.  This is an addictive fantasy--rooted in the earth-magic of Britain's standing stones and holy wells; full of secrets and mysteries; and surprisingly sexy too, as Clare and Mark fall in love.  An enchanting novel of love, duty, and growing up.<br />I recommend _The China Garden_ to anyone who enjoyed Alan Garner's _The Owl Service_ and Elizabeth Pope's _The Perilous Gard_.  It isn't suitable for preteens, because of the couple of sexy scenes, but nothing in it will be shocking to a high-school student.  Highly recommended to teens and adults.	2002-03-21

Much has been written about the connection between faeries and half-remembered indigenous gods, and about the possibility that faeries were actually an ancient race of humans banished to the wilds.  The market is filled, today, with books of beautiful and sweet faeries.  But there is no other book like this one.<br />Diane Purkiss's theory is that the faeries are reminiscent of the demons of the Mediterranean culture--the lamashtu who steals babies away into death, the lamia who seduces and devours men--and that faery lore deals with the same issues as these earlier myths.  The faeries, she contends, were an explanation for why beautiful young people were taken away in illness and death.   She tells heartbreaking stories of women who tortured and abandoned their sick babies, thinking them changelings; she disturbs us with the tale of Michael Cleary, who killed his wife and honestly seemed to believe his *real* wife would return to him now that he had disposed of the faery impostor.  A far-fetched belief?  Perhaps not; fairy stories of the time seemed to advocate just such actions.  Purkiss takes us on an uncomfortable journey through the most brutal of faery myths, then into the Victorian age, when faeries became a symbol of idealized childhood.  But there was a dark side to this as well--onstage \\"faeries\\" were played by street orphans who lived incredibly hard lives, and Barrie's _Peter Pan_ takes on a very different undertone when it comes out that the children in the play were based on children Barrie had known, who had *died young* and therefore stayed forever young.  <br />I would have given this book five stars for its unique and disturbing perspective--it ought to be on the shelves of faery enthusiasts if only for balance--but I subtracted a star because Purkiss insists that her theory is the only valid way to look at the fairy-faith.  There are many different beliefs that shaped the concept of the faery; I applaud Purkiss for digging into some of the darkest ones.  But, as I said before, balance...balance...balance.	2002-03-21

I submitted my review of this book a few minutes ago, and just now realized I'd forgotten something I wanted to say.  _The China Garden_ is a wonderful book, but the publishers gave it short shrift--I had to return my first copy to the bookstore because the first line of each page was cut off for some ten pages or so.  So, if you buy this book, make sure to thumb through it so you can catch any page-cutting gaffes before you've dog-eared the book too much to return it.	2002-03-21

Anything I've ever read by her, I've liked.  This collection is no exception.  With killer wit and straightforward prose, Yolen playes around with Emily Dickinson, fairy tales, and anything else that strikes her fancy.<br />The essential element in each of these stories is a big twist, a completely new look at something we had previously taken for granted.  We assume certain things, and Yolen challenges our assumptions.  What if Emily Dickinson's otherworldly poetry was just that--inspired by a joyride through outer space?  What if the thirteenth fairy cursed the princess by accident; what if Snow White knew better than to let strangers into her cottage; what if Rumplestiltskin was an unjustly maligned Jewish moneylender; what if the girls in Peter Pan's hideaway got sick of playing housewife?  The result is a wonderful collection of stories where you're never sure what the ending will be, but you can't wait to find out.<br />An added bonus--at the end she reminisces about the making of each story, the idea that got each one started.  I love it when authors tell the stories behind the stories.	2002-03-16
US	49828549	R1G4V5ENYCSPX4	0451458672	388434684	Drinking Midnight Wine	Books	3	1	1	N	N	I love the characters, but where's the Mysterie?	Simon Green lives in Bradford-on-Avon in real life, and I'll wager a guess as to how this book came to be written.  I think Green has met some eccentric folks and seen some weird places in the time he has lived in that town, and so it occurred to him to make up magical explanations for them, and build a fantasy novel around them.  <br />Green does a great job of creating engaging characters and vivid scenery.  Our hero is Toby, a thirtysomething bookstore clerk who loves books and the pretty lady on the train, and hates exercise and mornings.   We also run into the lady-on-the-train herself, aloof Gayle, and her half-crazy sister Luna, both of whom are more than they seem, as well as a minor Norse god, a reluctant werewolf, a gossipy yet mysterious gypsy called the Waking Beauty, and a colony of hippie mice.  They are set in a town where that spooky old manor on the edge of town just might hide the scion of elemental evil, and where any house might be more on the inside than it appears on the outside.  The characters and setting are wonderful.<br />Unfortunately, the plot feels like an afterthought.  Green sets up all these great characters, and puts them into a story that feels way too simplistic and rehashed.  For the first two-thirds of the book, people mostly sit around and talk.  The good guys talk, filling each other in on the history of the magical world, Mysterie, with the effect that very little about it remains mysterious at all.  The bad guys sit around and talk about their evil plot, which can be summed up in a famous line from a certain cartoon series: \\"We're going to take over the world!\\"  Then Toby undergoes a near-death experience that seems to serve absolutely no purpose in propelling the plot along.  Finally, the good guys gang up together and decide to go attack the bad guys.  A fight ensues, and all ends quite sweetly.  (If you don't like mushy happy endings, you won't like this.  Emotional family reunions abound.) The heroes would have lost hadit come to brute force, but love and coincidence save the day.   No real surprises, no real mystery.  *shrug*  I guess it wasn't bad, but it could have been much better.	2002-03-14

Two gripes about _The Godmother's Web_:<br />(1) Cindy must be the dimmest heroine I've seen in a long time. First of all, what on earth does she see in Raydir? He only appreciates her when she's gone. Second, and more importantly, why must she spend chapters upon chapters upon chapters NOT realizing that Grandma Webster is supernatural? Cindy has met a real-life fairy godmother; it's not like she's never seen magic before. And here she is, traveling with a little old lady who nonetheless has boundless energy and physical fitness, whom everyone in the entire Southwest seems to know personally, and who has food that regenerates itself. After a hundred pages of this, you'd think it would have dawned on Cindy that Grandma is a little bit more than the average nursing-home escapee.<br />(2)...In _The Godmother_, though the characters frequently break into political rants, the speeches take a back seat to the story, but this book seems to be one long political speech about the plight of the Hopi and the Navajo. It doesn't matter how worthy the cause is; it doesn't matter whether you agree with her views or not. I agree with almost everything she says, and yet I don't appreciate being sledgehammered with a moral when I sit down in my chair looking for a good story. There are shining moments of good story--my favorite is the weaving scene, where Grandma manages to get a feuding family to see each other's worth again--but overall this reads more like a political tract. Gimme a break.	2002-03-12

She recounts this story at age 101; she has become a lonely and bitter woman, teased by the local kids for her disability, her facial scar, and her solitary ways.  But as she writes down the story of her adventure, she begins to sound feisty again, as if she's only just remembering that she did some great things and that she can still do a great good in the world.  For the spell that binds the Piper will break when she dies.  We find out that she is writing this down to accompany a special gift for a special young girl, passing along her knowledge both to enrich the girl's life and to ensure that someone will know what to do if the trouble arises again.  <br />Penelope is a wonderful and three-dimensional character, and her story is sometimes funny, sometimes sad, sometimes scary, and always interesting.  For almost any age.	2002-03-12

Susan Cooper does a very good job here of adapting the old story so that it's suitable for any age.  It requires changing a few plot elements, but the essential spirit of the story remains the same.<br />Margaret is tired of sewing and acting polite and talking about future husbands with the other girls at her father's castle, so she runs away to the woods of Carterhays to pick flowers.  She has been expressly forbidden to go there, of course.  There, she meets the handsome Tam Lin, and after arguing for a minute over who really owns the forest, they spend a pleasant afternoon talking and becoming friends in the woods.  When Margaret gets back home, she's in big trouble--she has actually been gone a week!  Her unlikely friendship with Tam Lin leads her to sneak out once again, to rescue him from the faeries during one of their processions.  She has to hold on to him as he turns into all sorts of scary animals--and, well, you know the rest.  Cooper does a wonderful job of depicting the feisty Margaret, and of adapting the story into something perfect for a little girl's shelf of fairy tale books.<br />I subtracted a star because I don't think the art really captures the magic of the story; it's too &quot;cute&quot; and too simple.  But maybe I'm just spoiled by Kinuko Craft's cover for McKillip's _Winter Rose_.  It just seems like the land of Faery requires absolutely lush artwork.	2002-03-12
US	49828549	R3T7IMKE0FHBOP	0451458400	680062402	Once upon a Winter's Night	Books	4	2	4	N	Y	A romantic adventure	In the foreword to _Once Upon a Winter's Night_, Dennis McKiernan theorizes that fairy tales used to be long epic stories, recited by talented bards, but that over the centuries only the bare bones of the stories have survived.  He goes on to say that &quot;East o' the Sun, West o' the Moon&quot; was one of his favorites as a child, and that he is now going to tell that story the way he wishes it had been told to him.  And I;m very glad he did so.<br />What we have here is a romantic, adventure-packed fairy tale for the grown-ups.  Camille agrees to marry the mysterious Prince Alain so that her parents can afford a doctor for her cute little sick brother, but comes to truly love the masked man with whom she shares a vast mansion.  When she inadvertently activates a curse upon him, he and the palace's staff all vanish in a great wind, and Camille has  a year and a day plus one moon's time in which to find him.  All she knows is that he is in a place east of the sun and west of the moon.<br />We travel through the land of Faery with Camille, meeting bards and sorceresses and dragons along the way, as Camille encounters danger after danger in her quest for someone who has heard of the place east of the sun and west of the moon.  On and on she travels, and over and over she meets people who can give her no answer.  Here the story becomes almost tedious--chapter after chapter of characters who aren't much help--but the effect is that we feel the endlessness of the journey right along with Camille.  We are heartstricken with her every time someone says &quot;I've never heard of it; go ask so-and-so.&quot;  We feel the impossibility of the quest, and anxiously count the days she has left.  By the climax of the novel, I had no idea how McKiernan was going to get Camille out of her predicament.  This is a testament to the author's skill, that I was so tense, as a reader, wondering how the heroine would ever succeed in her quest.  <br />Camille perseveres, and proves the strength of her love for Alain.  In the end, this is both an adventure and a romance, full of monsters and riddles and sensuality.  It reminded me of another book I love, Neil Gaiman's _Stardust_, though the tone is a little different.  Is it really true that there is to be a sequel?  I can't wait!	2002-03-09

(Here in Missouri, the fact that it was technically March and not January didn't necessarily mean anything.)  I curled up in my favorite chair with a blanket, and read the book in a matter of a few hours.  <br />_The Snow Queen_ is a short novel, a single-sitting book, and more enchanting than many longer works.  Nothing in this book is superfluous; Kernaghan tells the story she has come to tell--a reworking of Andersen's fairy tale of the same name--and that's it.<br />The enchantment begins with the cover, graced with a lovely illustration drawn from a 1913 book of fairy tales.  Then, in the first paragraph, I was taken back to my childhood storybooks as Gerda and Kay sat among the flowerboxes, conversing across the narrow space between their townhouses.  The setting is homey, but all is not well--Kai has grown snobbish and callous, insulting Gerda's poetry as \\"childish\\".  He has set aside poetry and dreams for the coldly logical world of mathematics.  And now a stranger, the mysterious Baroness Aurore, has come to town.  Kai is quite taken with her, and she takes him on a long journey.  He does not return.<br />Gerda, worried, sets off to find him--but the journey proves much longer and more difficult than expected.  Along the way she is robbed, and taken in by the robber-girl, Ritva, who has a story of her own.  Ritva is a shaman-in-training who isn't so sure she wants those talents, and longs to run away from her family.  When Gerda resumes her adventure, Ritva goes with her--both as an excuse to run away, and because of the girls' budding friendship.  Ritva is as street-smart and cynical as Gerda is trusting and naive, and they [but] heads at first, but in the end they forge a wonderful bond.  Neither of them could accomplish this mission without the other, and together they face the Snow Queen.  <br />I long for a sequel--the ending leaves mewondering what happens next--what Gerda and Ritva do with their lives, and whether Kai ever grows up.  <br />All in all, a lovely book, which makes me want to go and read the Kalevala, not to mention the original fairy tale.  Well done.  The obscurity of this book belies its quality.	2002-03-05

It did hold my attention long enough that I was able to finish it, but in the end I had to admit I didn't like it.<br />First gripe:  the endless and tedious scenes of Pyetr, Sasha, and Uulamets wandering around in the woods acting like jerks to one another.  Pages upon pages of one of the characters musing about what morons the other two are.  The use of the word \\"woodcraft\\" on what seems like every page, as Sasha or Pyetr admires Uulamets' skill in navigating the forest.  It begins to feel like we are reading the same chapter over and over after a while.<br />But that's the little gripe. The big one is what seems like a big continuity mistake.  Do not read on if you absolutely can't stand spoilers!  This spoiler refers to an incident in the middle of the book, not the ending, if that changes your feelings at all.<br />About a third of the way into the book, a false Eveshka is brought to lfe by Uulamets' magic.  He was trying to resurrect his dead daughter, but instead resurrected a version of her who was as he wanted her to be rather than as she was.  Now, Pyetr never had sexual or romantic feelings about Eveshka until this false Eveshka showed up; it was then that he started noticing her beauty.  BUT...later, Pyetr claims that he knew all along that the Eveshka look-alike was a fake, and all of a sudden he is in love with the real one.  Why?  He wasn't in love with her before.  He was annoyed by her until he met the fake one.  I don't think I understand.	2002-03-05

It just kind of...was.<br />The novel seems to be based on a tale the author's grandmother told her long ago, and I can see that this could have been an enchanting story when told in that way. In fact, had Croutier written a short story with this material, pruning out the fluff, it probably would have been a very good love story. As it is, we have a slim story padded out into a short novel, stuffed with ruminations about the Suez Canal, and about the nature of love. We have characters that I just couldn't get into. They never really seemed real to me. The hero is callous in his treatment of everyone but the heroine, the heroine is too sweet and beautiful to be real, and they wander through the novel spewing forth theories on the nature of love and of fate. They talk like proverbs, not like real people.  <br />Again, I would have liked it much better as a short story, with the forced philosophical musings left out.	2002-03-03

There were many more stories, of course, but the editor of this edition has chosen some of the most well-known and representative ones.  In addition, there are many tales included that aren't necessarily famous but are just as good as the familiar ones.  <br />The book opens with an interesting introduction, which shows how the Grimms were the first to seriously record folk wonder tales in a literary form, putting them in good prose but still maintaining respect for the original stories.  (The earlier French writers drew on folktales, but altered them into tales of courtly intrigue, and sometimes told them in a snickering, sarcastic style.)    Then, of course, come the tales themselves, well-written and yet hauntingly simple.<br />Note:  This is an edition for the grown-ups.   No illustrations.  Visually, it looks like a textbook rather than a book of fairy tales.  I do need to buy a pretty edition someday, to pass on to my hypothetical kids.  :)	2002-03-02

There are at least four novels I know of that are based on that old story, and each has its good points. Pope's _The Perilous Gard_ is the best-plotted; Wynne-Jones's _Fire and Hemlock_ has the most sympathetic characters; Dean's _Tam Lin_ is the funniest. And this one, McKillip's _Winter Rose_, does the most amazing job of making the faery world real. <br />In this beautifully poetic novel, wild Rois and her quiet sister Laurel both fall in love with a newcomer to town, Corbet Lynn, heir to a ruined castle, his grandfather's curse, and lots of unanswered questions. He longs for the stability he believes Laurel can give him, but at the same time he knows that only Rois will be able to solve the mystery of his past and help him find his future. When Corbet vanishes in the dead of winter, and Laurel pines away for him, Rois journeys deep into the wood, and deep into a gorgeous but frightening dream world, to find out how she can save her sister and her friend. McKillip's prose is magical and poetic, and we are left wondering what is dream and what is real, even as we shut the back cover. Haunting and beautiful.	2002-02-26

Sorcha and Hugh have lived happily together, and have three children, Niamh, Sean, and Liadan.  Niamh is a restless beauty with a case of wanderlust; Sean is a future leader growing up in his uncle Liam's mold; and Liadan is her mother's successor, a storyteller and healer.  But Liadan is not Sorcha; having grown up in a loving environment, Liadan is well-aware of her own worth, and acts with more confidence and defiance than Sorcha did.  In some ways I like Liadan better; in some ways I prefer Sorcha.  But both are ever engaging.<br />The \\"son of the shadows\\" of the title is Ciaran, a young druid who falls in star-crossed love with Niamh.  (Now, those of you who have read _Daughter of the Forest_ know there is a problem with this!)  Ciaran strikes off on his own after Niamh is forbidden to him; he is torn between love and honor, and between the disciplined magic of the druids and the darker sorcery inherited from his mother.  I am very interested in what happens to him, and to Niamh; I just hope Marillier deals with them in book three, as they are almost peripheral to this book, despite the title.  This is Liadan's story.<br />Liadan thinks she knows exactly what kind of life lies before her, until she falls in love with the leader of an outlaw band.  She spends the rest of the book using magic, wit, and courage to try and keep her family and her lover from killing one another--a Herculanean task--while also rebelling against the Fair Folk's desire to use her as a pawn in their plots.  This is the biggest difference between Sorcha and Liadan; Liadan never seems to obey anyone if she can help it.  Sorcha was more willing to submit to the Fair Folk's plans.   <br />_Son of the Shadows_ is a well-written and emotionally engaging story.  It feels bloodier and less magical than _Daughter_, but it's pretty good anyway, andeven as it ends, we feel the storms brewing that will need to be dealt with in _Child of the Prophecy_.  This story ain't pver yet, not by a long shot.  I eagerly await the third book, and the final resolution to all this turmoil.	2002-02-26

Marillier deftly sets the fairy tale &quot;The Six Swans&quot; in dark-ages Ireland; think of the general time period of _The Mists of Avalon_, when Christian and Pagan, Gael and Briton and Saxon, were fighting and feuding and even sometimes getting along.  The tale fits in amazingly well in the setting; the famous fairy tale echoes the Irish legend of Fionnuala and the children of Lir, which predated it.  The transformations, the impossible quests, the painful vows work perfectly in the Celtic milieu.  <br />Sorcha is the determined sister of the tale; she is a young girl with a healing gift and a love of nature.  In fact, it must be Marillier's love for nature's beauty that shines through Sorcha's words; every page is filled with lovely descriptions and a sense of magic.   Her mission, to weave shirts of stinging starwort for her six brothers while remaining silent, is made even more poignant by two of Marillier's additions to the tale.  First, Sorcha is a born storyteller; everything she does has a story to be told with it, and even as she keeps herself mute, she tells stories to herself in her mind.  Second, Marillier has given each of the brothers a distinct personality.  Some remain somewhat two-dimensional, but two or three of the brothers are vivid as life, and this makes their plight more urgent to the reader.  <br />I am floored when I hear that this was Marillier's first novel.  The beauty of the prose, the vision of nature, the haunting love stories, and the vivid characters ensure that I'll be reading the two sequels, and anything else Marillier writes after that.  Wonderful.	2002-02-19

I have no idea why the publishers are calling this science fiction.  It's really more of a horror/fantasy blend; the only sci-fi element I can think of is the near-future setting.  Which suits me just fine.  ;)<br />The world of _Brown Girl_ is frighteningly plausible--it is the logical conclusion of our current suburban sprawl and consequent urban decay.  Here, even the city government has fled to the suburbs, and no one is left in the inner city but the poor.  There is no electricity, no sewer system.  You can't get into the hospital unless you are wealthy.  And Rudy, the diabolical crime boss of Toronto, is selling organs to these hospitals--and let's just say the donors are less than willing.<br />And in this city lives Ti-Jeanne (Little Jeanne), a new mother, staying with her wise grandmother, Gros-Jeanne (Big Jeanne).  Gros-Jeanne wants to pass on her knowledge to Ti-Jeanne, but Ti-Jeanne only grudgingly learns herbal skills, and wants nothing to do with Gros-Jeanne's other talent--the practice of Afro-Caribbean magic.  Then one night they hold a ritual to help Ti-Jeanne's deadbeat ex-boyfriend, and the spirits tell Ti-Jeanne that it is her destiny to stop Rudy's evil.  <br />We are sucked in, as Ti-Jeanne's course becomes more irrevocable, as she comes to accept the orishas, and as her ex-boyfriend's fear and drug addiction drive him into worse and worse trouble.  Ti-Jeanne's only hope lies in her wits and in half-remembered bits of magical lore.  An engrossing read; however, don't buy this if you object to violence.  There is a good bit of that.	2002-02-19

Somehow, her prose manages to be hauntingly strange and deliciously earthy at once.  I didn't like all of the stories in this collection, but I very much liked some of them, and I'm glad I read the book.  I especially enjoyed the title story (a retelling of \\"Bluebeard\\"), and \\"The Lady of the House of Love\\", quite possibly my favorite vampire tale ever.  In it, the tragic lady Nosferatu reads her Tarot cards every night, and every night draws cards signifying death--until one night she draws Les Amoureux, the Lovers, and everything changes.  Splendid.<br />There is more here--a raunchy \\"Puss in Boots\\", two takes on \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", several stories dealing with werewolves and/or Red Riding Hood, and much more.	2002-02-19

If you like adult fairy tales, don't hesitate for another moment.  There is something in here for every taste, and Zipes is picky enough about quality that every story is well-written even if it's not in your favorite style.  My only gripe is that it ends on a down note, with a depressing story by de Larrabeiti.  I liked the story, but I wanted a happy tale at the close of the book.  But that's just a quirk of mine.  Highly recommended.	2002-02-17

Die-hard romance readers or Woodiwiss fans may want to disregard my review, as I am neither of the above.  I bought _A Rose in Winter_ because of my love for the \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" theme, eager to see what this particular author might bring to the classic tale.  <br />Basically, what happens is this: the lovely Erienne falls madly in heat with an American rogue, Christopher Seton, but is auctioned off in marriage to pay her father's gambling debts.  The winning bridegroom is Lord Saxton, the local noble who has just returned to his lands after being presumed dead in a horrible fire years ago.  He limps, and wears a mask to hide his face.  Erienne marries him, while still lusting after Seton, and then the following things happen for the next 300 pages:<br />(1)A boorish man tries to paw and/or rape Erienne, and she is rescued by a man, whether that be Seton, Saxton, the butler, or whoever happens to be handy.  (Never mind that no man in that cultural milieu would have approached a lady of rank in that way.  Especially with her husband or father in the next room.  This would have been a great way to get killed, and everyone would have known it.)<BR>(2)Christopher tries to seduce Erienne, and she fights him off, then wishes she hadn't.<BR>(3)Saxton makes advances to Erienne, and she runs away in panic.<br />These three scenes are repeated, over and over and over, ad nauseam.  Finally I got bored, and since I already had figured out the Deep Dark Secret, I just skipped ahead to the ending.  I think I skipped 100-150 pages, and I would bet I didn't miss much.  This would have made a decent book at half the length, but it just didn't hold much interest after the nature of the Secret became obvious.	2002-02-17

What I will say is this: _Deerskin_ is not fluff. And Robin McKinley sure knows how to use the English language.<br />We are in her spell from the beginning. The book commences with Lissar's nurse telling her a fairy tale--but the fairy tale is the story of how Lissar's larger-than-life parents met. She is told from the very cradle what paragons her mother and father are, and yet she herself is ignored by them. McKinley seduces us with the the magical kingdom's rarefied beauty and glamour--and also the coldness and rot at its core. When Lissar flees, we are shown, with the same deftness, an inhospitable wilderness. And when she finds the kingdom of Cofta, we can't help but notice the difference between it and Lissar's old home; it is more pompous in its architecture, but filled with human warmth. McKinley is equally at home in the throne room and in the dog kennels, and she makes all of it real for us, as Lissar, with the help of the Moonwoman, heals and begins to imagine a new life for herself. <br />I knock off half a star because of a little peeve of mine. McKinley's imaginary world is very similar to our own in terms of flora and fauna. People own dogs, ride horses, and hunt deer and rabbits. But then McKinley feels obligated to point out that this is an imaginary world by also populating the forests with \\"ootag\\" and \\"toro\\". These words are bandied about constantly, but never quite explained, except that they're animals. I still don't know what an ootag is. As for toro, my guess would have been a wild bull (given my knowledge of Romance languages)--but guess what--it's more like a giant stag. Why couldn't she have just said \\"stag\\"? I don't know. The made-up words are jarring. Also, the climactic scene is somewhat overdone.  Other than that, splendidly done.	2002-02-17

Worth wasn't a witch at all, but a poet, and she had always been fascinated by folk magic.  From this fascination came the Crone's Books, two books of magic written in an archaic and poetic style.  <br />The device works perfectly.  Come on now, fellow witches, admit it: when you first got into the Craft, you were secretly longing for some great-aunt to draw you aside and confess that your whole family had been witches since time immemorial.  ;)  This book was written in the sixties, but it *feels* like lovingly preserved family tradition, and therein lies the magic.  The writing style takes you right into a frame of mind where you're ready to believe anything is possible, and that's always the best way to make your magic work!<br />Now, not all the spells are useful, and some of them will be found unethical or offensive by some readers.  However, there are some gems, especially the Ceremonies for the Year.  (The book ends with a set of twelve rituals to celebrate the Wheel.  They are absolutely spine-tingling.)  Overall, _The Crone's Book of Charms and Spells_ is a testament to the power of language to make magic.  I've readtons of modern spell books that just don't give the reader that magical feeling.  This book inspires both the Witch and the fantasy writer in me.  Brava.	2002-02-07

I was even more ecstatic when it didn't disappoint me.  I was afraid the book would be a skim-over-the-surface effort, touching only briefly on Brigid and then continuing on to subjects having nothing to do with her.  Basically, I was afraid the book would try too hard to be eclectic.  <br />Fortunately, the two Ladies K did a wonderful job with their subject.  They briefly mentioned other holidays celebrated in other cultures at the same time, and then settled down quite comfortably to talk in-depth about Brigid in her several forms: as an ancient goddess, as a faery of the Sidhe, and as a human saint.  I was especially impressed with the section on St. Brigid.  Most pagan authors, when writing about Brigid, simply frown angrily at the end of the goddess's myth and rant, \\"And then the Christians stole her and made her into a saint!\\"  Lol.  Here, St. Brigid gets respect.  There is an impressive collection of St. Brigid wonder tales, several of which were completely new to me.  The authors even see a silver lining in the replacement of the goddess by the saint--by recasting Brigid as a human woman, the Irish may have felt closer to her, since she was more like an old friend than a distant deity.<br />Then the authors get into practical suggestions: rituals, crafts, and recipes.  They include rituals for one, for a family, and for a coven.  There is a thick chapter on making your own candles.  And the recipes, which I didn't get to try yet since I got the book the day before Imbolc, look yummalicious!  And for the authenticity police, there is a note by each recipe saying whether it's ancient, post-Crusades, or post-Columbus.<br />Overall, a warm and approachable guide to the Imbolc Sabbat, by two authors who seem like really great people.   I have tons of ideas for next year now.	2002-02-07
US	49828549	RWJ470NBAQBDF	0812565495	502372960	Moonlight & Vines (Newford)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	The search for magic continues	_Moonlight and Vines_ is a well-written collection of stories, set in a modern city, intended to give the reader a sense of wonder, and make us believe that there is magic afoot, even in our most run-down urban slums.  <br />Charles de Lint is wonderful at treading that line between fantasy and realism, where we wonder right along with the characters, \\"what is real?\\"  That is his biggest talent; his biggest flaw is trying too hard to insert a moral into each of these stories.  They all seem to be making a point.  Sometimes this is annoying; sometimes the story is so good I don't mind at all.  Still, I would have given the book three stars, since the moralizing tends to place an artificial distance between the reader and the story.  <br />Then I read \\"Birds\\".  My favorite story in the anthology, it deals with two young women's search for peace of mind, and the rituals they use to find it.  De Lint has captured the very essence of magic and of personal ritual.  I'm a pagan/witchy type, and I've read so many formulaic lists of \\"spell ingredients\\" I could puke; de Lint's description of the women's search for certain objects of personal value is right on the money.  I want to copy the whole darn story into my BOS.	2002-02-07

The authors of the short stories herein were just beginning to try the fairy tale form, and a lot of them weren't quite sure what to do with it.  \\"Hmmm,\\" I can almost hear them saying, \\"they want me to adapt fairy tales for big folks?  Well, a liberal helping of sex and gore should do it!\\"<br />Most of the stories in this collection are filled with visceral violence, and nauseated me.  There is also a lot of sex.  Now, normally I don't mind sex in books.  But this isn't erotic sex, it tends to be twisted and sadistic sex and/or rape.  It doesn't feel \\"sexy\\" at all; it just seems to be a further extension of the violence.  Most of the stories don't bother being subtle or evocative when they can be gross and shocking instead.<br />A few exceptions:  (1) The wonderful \\"The Moon is Drowning While I Sleep\\", by Charles de Lint, about a young woman having a serial dream where she has to rescue the Moon from some nasty faeries, while her waking self doesn't know whether to take these nightly adventures seriously.  (2)  \\"Like a Red, Red Rose\\", which does have some blood, but is also a compelling Gothic story that reminds me of Hawthorne somehow. The heroine is a witch's daughter unaware of a family curse.  (3) \\"The Princess in the Tower\\", a comedic Rapunzel variation set in Italy.  <br />I think the de Lint story is the only one that will truly stay with me, and while it's very good, it's not worth buying SWBR.  De Lint has several short story collections out--I don't remember which one \\"The Moon...\\" is in, but it shouldn't be hard to find.  Other than that, this book is ultimately forgettable, not nearly as good as later volumes in the series.	2002-02-05
US	49828549	R36JPNF1V79QL8	044100444X	102431513	Winter Tides	Books	2	1	2	N	N	Not what I expected	_Winter Tides_ disappointed me, but I suppose I must put the blame on the publisher rather than the author.  Mainly I was miffed because the blurb on the back promised something totally different from what was actually in the book.  The blurb spoke of a man named Dave, and his relationship with the girl he had saved from drowning years before, and with the ghost of her sister whom he failed to save.  What I got was a novel about a psychopath named Edmund, who wasn't even mentioned on the cover.<br />Dave and the sisters were there, all right, but they were dealt with shallowly.  Even when the story was being told from Dave or Anne's point of view, the author never really went deeply into what they were thinking or feeling, just their physical actions.  Elinor, the ghost sister, gets even shorter shrift, and mainly seems to be a plot device.  The romance between Dave and Anne is skimmed over, and both of their feelings for Elinor are summed up in a few sentences here and there.  The only intricate characterization in the book is that of Edmund, a true loony who thinks torturing people is a fine art form.  Blaylock does a good job of depicting him, but I wasn't expecting a psychopath story, I don't really like psychopath stories, they're just not my thing.  I was led to expect a ghost story and a love story.  <br />If you like novels about psychopaths and serial killers, go ahead and buy this--it's well done if you like that sort of thing.  Blaylock's subtlety and restraint leave the worst bits to the imagination, thereby creating a more palpable terror.  Just don't buy this if you're looking for a dark fantasy or a romance.	2002-02-04

My fiance' has been pestering me for years about the Lord of the Rings, since he figures any fantasy fan worth her/his salt ought to have experienced the trilogy.  I've begun to read the books a bunch of times, and every time I found them beautifully written--but also slow, plodding, and devoid of convincing female characters.  Finally, on a long road trip, I made myself finish the first two books, and when I hit the third book, I got the reward!<br />_The Return of the King_ is worth every plodding moment in the first two installments, IMHO.  Though the story has been slow up until this point, suddenly it breaks into nonstop adrenaline-laced action with the battle of Minas Tirith, and heartbreaking suspense as Frodo and Sam travel the last agonizing stretch to Orodruin.  And none of this would make any sense without the first two books' buildup.  If you can get through the first two books, you'll find that they're worth it.<br />And lo and behold, I also found the feisty Eowyn, for whom I caught myself cheering aloud a couple of times!	2002-01-30

With a sudden flash, college-aged Polly remembers her old friend Thomas Lynn, and realizes it's been years since she thought of him.  It's almost like he's been erased from her memory, she thinks.  Strange, since as she delves deeper into her memories, he turns out to have been her best friend, and the one bright spot in a very difficult adolescence.  <br />Trying to solve the mystery of why he has vanished from her life, she asks around, only to find that none of her friends or family remember him either--they think Thomas was an imaginary friend she made up.  Was he?  Or has something else happened?  And if he is real,  where has he gone?<br />Diana Wynne Jones draws us into her spell with this novel, never letting us put it down.

Using it has shown me both its positive points and its flaws.<br />I still love the art, which manages to be evocative and intuitive while remaining very simple and spare.  Another fine point is the historical info about the moon mansions, which can add nuance to a reading.  I find that the Moon Oracle is especially accurate when doing a short-term reading.  Because the moon changes phases and signs every few days, the oracle is well-suited to questions concerning the immediate future--&quot;Should I go to this party?&quot;  &quot;How should I deal with work tomorrow?&quot;<br />I have, however, noticed a flaw in the accompanying book.  The back of the book claims to present an accurate chart of the moon's phases and signs--but the authors say that if the current date falls between two entries, to use the earlier one, which leads to inaccuracy.  For example, if the Gibbous Moon is in Scorpio, and the Full is in Capricorn, you might consult the oracle between those two dates and think the current moon is in Scorpio, when it might well be in Sagittarius or even Capricorn.  It all depends on how picky you want to be.  It bugged me.  I recommend a Witches' Almanac, or if you want to get REALLY specific, Pharr's _Moon Wise_, which lets you calculate the actual degrees you are into each sign, so you can even look up what moon mansion you're in.	2002-01-27

I didn't get any of that out of _The Game_.  <br />_The Game_ is basically the story of two sisters:  Julia, a sociable but shallow novelist who writes about the boredom of domestic life; and Cassandra, a nunlike scholar who hides away from real life in the cloistered world of high academia.  The \\"game\\" referred to in the title is an imaginary Arthurian world invented by the sisters when they were children, but it has little bearing on the rest of the novel, except in that Cassandra went on to become an Arthurian scholar, and Julia uses it as an example of Cassandra's condescension.  It could have been dropped from the plot without much effect, which is sad for me, since the Arthurian element is the biggest reason I wanted to read the book in the first place.<br />Leaving out Arthur, who is mostly irrelevant anyway, we have Julia and Cassandra, who are just repairing their estranged relationship, when Simon Moffat comes back into their life.  Simon was both women's first love; Cassandra adored him from a distance, while Julia slept with him.  This triangle was the reason for their estrangement.  When he reappears, so do the tensions between the sisters.  <br />_The Game_ failed to engage me; most of the characters were pretty one-dimensional and cold.  Cassandra had a few moments of stunning dignity, but she didn't seem real either.  A.S. Byatt has gotten much better since.	2002-01-23

Geras has a knack for writing straight from the heart of a teenage girl; she seems to recall this perfectly, as so few writers do.  <br />This talent shows up in _Happy Endings_, an earlier novel, as well.  Unfortunately, the heroine, Mel, doesn't have as juicy a plot to work through.  Here's the premise:  Mel gets a part in a community-theater production of Chekhov's _Three Sisters_.  She is instant friends with Clare, the sweet and worldly stage manager, who is recovering from divorce and finding love again with the director, Chris.  But when Clare goes out of town, Mel suspects he is having an affair with an actress, and starts meddling.  Alongside this plot runs the story of Mel's own romance with a \\"mysterious\\" boy who won't talk about his home life, but this mystery is quickly solved, and the relationship between him and Mel is never looked at deeply.  They kiss in the prop room.  That's about it.  Mel's heart is more engaged in worrying about Clare's love life than her own.  It feels like Geras wanted to write about Clare but decided to write from Mel's point of view to make it a teen novel, and so both Clare's and Mel's stories lose some immediacy.  <br />The final disappointment came at the very end of the book.  See, the beginning of the story featured Mel, homebound with a broken ankle, reminiscing about the production of _Three Sisters_, and the broken ankle is talked about enough that I expected its breaking to be a major plot point--like maybe the catty actress tripped Mel to take over her part, or something--and at the end it turns out *SPOILER* that the broken ankle is basically irrelevant to the story.  It just seems to be a device to get Mel on a couch where she can sit and write.  *sigh*<br />All in all, it's a pretty good book, but it can't hold a candle to the Egerton Hall books.Look for _The Tower Room_ and its sequels.	2002-01-22

He jumps between points-of-view constantly, so it's hard to tell who's thinking what.  After I got used to that, though, I found a moving story in this book.<br />Alasdair is the seventh swan-brother from the famous fairy tale, left with a swan's wing instead of one of his arms because his sister was unable to finish that last shirt in time.  He is a young Scottish lord in this novel, incredibly handsome but shrouded in self-pity and the immaturity that comes from having such a strange &quot;childhood&quot;.  Since he lacks his sword-arm, he has a bodyguard, Ewen, a gruff mercenary who is both more kind and more haunted than he seems.<br />Alasdair also has a sweetheart, Fenella, who finds out about what ails him--and being an intrepid young lady, sets out immediately to find the magic to give him back his arm!  But dangers await, and many dumb decisions are made by various characters, and misadventures ensue.  We come to care for all of the characters.  Although I would have preferred a different ending to the story, _The Seventh Swan_ was worth reading.	2002-01-16

Each story is told in lush detail through the eyes of angst-ridden teenage girls.  For the most part, the stories failed to grab me in the way that they captivated other reviewers; maybe it's because my teen years weren't marked by either the luxury or the tragedy seen in these stories.  The stories are set in a modern setting and include current social issues, but most of them don't seem to really add new dimensions to the old tales.  On top of everything else, the book is quite short; the print is large and the margins absolutely immense.  I was stunned when I realized it was over.<br />The stellar exception is &quot;Ice&quot;, a retelling of &quot;The Snow Queen&quot;, about a girl whose soul mate is stolen from her by the impossible beauty of a rival.  The story is a wrenching and hard-hitting look at the fear, shared by zillions of women, of being cast aside for a pretty face.  I cried over this one.	2002-01-11

Andrews when we're in high school. We grow up on fairy tales, and we are enchanted by these stories of downtrodden young girls who persevere and find love, success, and happiness. Then, someone convinces us we're too old for &quot;that stuff&quot;, and that we ought to read realistic stories instead. In Andrews' gothic novels, especially the Heaven and Dawn series, we find the very same kinds of stories--the stories of young women making it despite horrible circumstances--and that's why we take so easily to those books. They're &quot;realistic&quot; enough to satisfy our left brains, but I'm gaping at this point as I recall all the fairy-tale elements in those stories--the ash girls and wicked stepsisters and what-have-you.<br />In that vein, I recommend the Egerton Hall series. I don't mean to say they are just like V.C. Andrews novels; they're not. Geras has a COMPLETELY different and much brighter style; even the darkest book of the trilogy, _Watching the Roses_, has its moments of humor and lightness. And, there is no incest, fewer Dark Family Secrets, and almost no purely good or evil characters--everyone in Geras' books is only human, with good and bad qualities. What they do have, is three sensitive and talented young girls on the brink of adulthood, dealing with love, hate, family, friendship, jealousy, and schoolwork--and sometimes disowning, rape, and attempted murder. Each of the books tells the story of one of the girls' initiation, so to speak, when she learns about love and about the adult world. And each parallels a classic fairy tale the reader will remember from childhood--and yet they are not fantasy; it is human resourcefulness and not magic that wins the day here. I can't explain, without sounding pedantic, how much these novels affected me; all I can say is this: I am 23 now. I wish I had had these books at 14. They are going to be on the shelf of my (hypothetical) daughter once she reaches puberty. <br />This is the first novel of the trilogy. It parallels &quot;Rapunzel&quot;, and tells the story of Megan, the most down-to-earth of the three girls. Orphaned in childhood, she lives at a boarding school with her guardian, Dorothy, who teaches at the school. She is sheltered, and has rarely met boys. Then, Dorothy hires a handsome young teaching assistant, with whom both Dorothy and Megan fall in love. He returns Megan's feelings, and a secret affair ensues. He seems oblivious to the fact that she is only seventeen, and she is soon in over her head. Then Dorothy finds out...<br />Is their relationship based only on sex and infatuation, or can it grow stronger, strong enough to endure ostracism, poverty, and hardship? The book's ending is a question mark. The romance is not resolved until three-quarters of the way through the third book, _Pictures of the Night_. (Note to Editor: Please compile the three books into one volume!) I recommend reading all three, both to read the end of Megan's tale, and to read the equally compelling stories of her friends Alice and Bella.	2001-12-14

The third and final installment of the Egerton Hall series, _Pictures of the Night_, is a retelling of the Snow White story.  Our heroine this time is Bella, the most flamboyant, rebellious, and wild of the three girls.  This is the only one of the books not told in a diary format, which I found to be an excellent touch, since I could never see Bella sitting down long enough to write a journal.  <br />Wanting to get away from her jealous stepmother, who is upset because her hairdresser thinks Bella is prettier, Bella crashes at the house of a band, the Magnificent Seven, with whom she sometimes sings.  They get a gig in Paris, and Bella runs off with them for the summer, telling her father and stepmother that she's staying with a friend's aunt.  She finds ecstasy on stage, and two very different kinds of love, but always there is a whiff of fear in the air.  For Bella is constantly meeting strange women, women who remind her of her stepmother, who rave of her beauty and then give her gifts which always somehow result in Bella becoming ill.   Then she returns to Egerton for the fall term, and she and her friends discuss their future plans, and Bella does a lot of soul-searching.  And the band is getting ready to play one last big show--and this time her stepmother will be in the audience.  <br />Bella can be obnoxious, shallow, and callous, but I accept that, because making her &quot;sweetness and light&quot; wouldn't be true to the Bella we saw in the first two books.  My only gripe is that Miss van der Leyden does not appear in this book.  Dear Ms. Geras:  Please write a book about everyone's favorite housemother.  There must be a story there.	2001-12-14

Echoing the fairy tale &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; and a little bit of &quot;Red Riding Hood&quot;, it is also the most romantic, most gothic, and darkest of the three books.  <br />Alice was cursed at her christening by her aunt, &quot;the dreaded Violette&quot;, who was angry at not being invited; the curse stated that she would be &quot;snuffed out&quot; on her eighteenth birthday.  Another aunt tried to mitigate this by wishing her health and a long life, assuring her parents that, while Alice might fall ill or have an accident that year, she would recover.  Eighteen years later, the family throws a grand coming-out party for Alice, to defy Violette's dark words.  And at this party, Alice is raped.<br />Alice retreats into silence, hiding in her room and refusing to speak to anyone.  Her parents fall into despair as well, drinking and taking sleeping pills, and letting even the precious rose garden go to ruin.  Alice sits alone, writing her thoughts in an old notebook of her father's, peppered with his notes on this rose or that.  The rose descriptions at the beginning of each of Alice's entries are easy to skim over, but don't--they set the mood for the next installment of the story.   Alice wants to break out of her shell, and can't find the strength to do so; the only thing that sustains her are dreams of her long-distance sweetheart, Jean-Luc.  How will she &quot;wake up&quot; back into normal life?  Read and find out...	2001-12-14

In traditional fairy tales, fairy godmothers show up when they are least expected but most needed, to right wrongs and assist those in peril.  Enter Felicity Fortune.  Summoned to Seattle by a sweet but burned-out young social worker named Rose, she sets out to solve problems both modern and ageless with magic and kindness.  <br />You see, there are many young people in danger in the city.  Hank and Gigi have been abandoned by their mother and kidnapped by a child molester.  Cindy has just been fired from her job by her own stepsisters, and booted out of her family home.  Snohomish is hiding in the woods from a hit man hired by her jealous supermodel stepmom.  Dico is living on the streets, unable to get any breaks...until he meets a magic cat.  Any of this sound familiar?  LOL<br />In this entertaining and sometimes thought-provoking novel, we see that today's problems are nothing new, and that a little kindness goes a long way.  One caveat:  Scarborough can get a little sledgehammer-ish with her political views.  While I agree with most of these opinions, sometimes the character of Rose talks more like an editorial than a normal human being making conversation.  Still, I found this relatively easy to overlook.  Overall, I recommend _The Godmother_ to anyone who likes this sort of thing.	2001-12-14

It's based on a ballad, &quot;The Fairy Queen's Nurse&quot;, and I always love books based on ballads, in  general.  Plus, the story was pretty decent most of the way; although the writing could get a little choppy and weirdly paced (Oops, three years just passed, and barely a sentence is given to it).  I found it hard to get truly interested in any of the narrators, since they just seem to be Generically Nice People without many quirks or anything.  The most three-dimensional character was the villainess Bab Magga.  But all in all, it was going okay.<br />Then the ending approached.   As the book progressed toward a climax, almost nothing seemed to work right for me as a reader.  Eelie did a memory regression to figure out why he couldn't walk; his solution was so simple and obvious that he shouldn't have needed to meditate to get it.  And then suddenly he knows this, and he can walk.  All in about 2 pages.  Also, and more importantly, a big and moving reunion scene between Nora, Owen, and Eben was being set up throughout the novel.  Then, when it finally happens, whose POV are we reading it from?  Eelie's, and he's watching from a distance.  No emotional release.  Argh.  Then there is a long digression at the end that just seems to be Eelie going for a joyride.  It's like someone told the author, &quot;I need you to tack ten more pages onto the end.&quot;  <br />_A Dark Hown Blowing_ could have been so good, but wasn't.	2001-12-13

This novel takes place in the selfsame valley where Blodeuwedd, Lleu, and Gronw played out their tragic love-triangle in times long past, and the spirit of the conflict still haunts the valley.  Every generation, the situation crops up again, with different people playing the parts, but always ending badly.<br />One summer, it is three teenagers who enact the old story; a young girl and her stepbrother, visiting from the city, and a local boy.  At first read, it isn't clear what Alison, Roger, and Gwyn have to do with the legend of Blodeuwedd, since their situation is different on the surface.  If I'd only read the book once, I might give it two and a half stars.  But upon re-reading,  the resonances became more apparent, and I began to see the points in the story that correspond to events in the legend.<br />I want to give it three and a half stars, but Amazon won't let me do that, and my grade school teachers drummed it into my head that something-and-a-half rounds up to the next whole number.  *wink*  So, four stars.  I would have liked it better if the characters had been fleshed out more before the legend started controlling their lives; the spirit of the old conflict started turning them into unsympathetic jerks before I had a chance to develop a liking for the people they really were.  Still, a decent piece of myth-based fiction.	2001-12-12

Giving up in the middle of my second attempt to read this book...<br />I've heard some rave reviews about _Moonwise_, and plus I like a good intellectual challenge from time to time, so I desperately wanted to understand and like this book. Now, I could do one of two things here. I could pretend that I understood every word and that the book moved the earth for me, etc, etc. Or I could just come straight out and say, &quot;I can't follow it.&quot; I don't care at this point if my opinion makes some people think I'm unintelligent or whatever. I have to be honest. I'm not going to rave on and on about the Emperor's lovely new clothes if he looks naked to me, and I'm not going to rave about this book when just trying to follow the plotline gives me a headache. From time to time Gilman achieves some very pretty poetry, but she also uses pages and pages of opaque prose and made-up words to describe an scene or action that could be described more succinctly, or at least in English. I'm sorry, but I just don't get it.<br />OK, so it is technically possible to find the plot; after I gave up on finishing the book, I skimmed the rest of it to find out what happened.  It is fairly straightforward if you can get past the made-up words and the thick dialect.  It's just that it could have been a much shorter novel, and a better one, if about a gazillion pages of &quot;unmoons&quot; and &quot;unenskied&quot; had been left out.  And I wouldn't have needed the Excedrin.	2001-12-12

Reading through it, I discovered a rich world of magic, romance, and tragedy within these old songs.  From the well-known ballads like &quot;Tam Lin&quot; and &quot;Thomas the Rhymer&quot; to more obscure tales, just as affecting, there is so much here--&quot;Kempion&quot;, the tale of a woman turned into a dragon, who can only resume her true form if the prince kisses her rather than fighting her.  &quot;Gil Brenton&quot;, the tale of a young woman trying to hide her pregnancy from her new husband--but there is something very interesting she doesn't know about her old lover's identity.  And reams and reams of tragic songs of love lost.<br />Kinsley provides only one version of each of the ballads; some of them, in Child's original collection had twenty or more variants.  But if you find one you are drawn to, you can always go to the library or search the Internet, and find the other versions.  Think of Kinsley's book as a sort of overview, one that fits on your bookshelf with ease.  Kinsley even provides melodies for some of the ballads whose tunes have survived.

Their themes seem frivolous now, but the stories were actually quite subversive for their time; in them, the authors promoted female autonomy, true love, and marriage by choice rather than by arrangement.  (The authors themselves often were the victims of terrible arranged marriages.  In these stories they dream of a better world.)<br />The stories are not the succinct tales we are used to; they can be byzantine and winding.  Just when you think it's time for \\"happily ever after\\", in comes another twist.  But the tales are for the most part both funny and romantic, and I enjoyed them.<br />This might even be considered essential reading, if you're reading _From the Beast to the Blonde_.  As I read Warner's scholarly study, I kept wishing I had access to the obscure stories she was constantly quoting.  When I found this, it helped a great deal; I only wish _Wonder Tales_was sold in paperback as a companion volume to Beast/Blonde.	2001-12-07

It just fit incredibly well; the book followed both the myth and the fairy tale, making me realize just how much symbolism the two stories had in common in the first place.  It is a testament to Lee's skill that after reading the book, I began to seriously wonder whether the fairy tale truly *is* a corrupted version of the myth, distorted through centuries.  Whether there is any real connection, the world may never know--but Lee makes us believe there is.<br />And as I write this, I remember that in ancient times Demeter was associated with the mirror.<br />I deducted one star because I had trouble sympathizing with the characters; they seem emotionally cold throughout much of the book.

Natil herself is suicidal, and wants nothing more than to crawl under a rock and cease to exist.

So anyway, they're the hope of the Elven race, and Natil goes on about her business, bemoaning her own lack of powers and still planning her departure from this world. Natil's self-pity blinds her to the much more dire plight of Omelda; I was sorely disappointed in Natil over this. <br />Eventually, all the major characters end up charged by the Inquisition. Description of nasty tortures follows. Some of the characters get a semi-happy ending, due to the fact that money conquers all, but the end suffered by one of the characters is absolutely pointless and depressing. Overall, the book sunk me into a morass of despair while all the while making me want to throw up. I wanted to wash my brain out with soap afterward. (Literally--after I finished the book, I had to read some pages of something else before I could sleep.) Perhaps this is the effect Baudino is trying to acheive. And yes, I know that these atrocities really happened to real people during those times. But there's no law saying I have to enjoy reading about it in detail. The scenes where Natil actually *does* something, for example when she plays the harp or when she stands up to the Inquisitor,are quite good, but you have to wade through hundreds of pages of gross-out to find them.	2001-12-02

Instead, this is a book with beautiful writing and almost no plot.  It consists mostly of the reminiscences of three generations of women who go around acting nasty to one another, and seeking meaningless sex.  I couldn't connect with any of the characters or make myself care about their situations.  However, make sure to read the rest of the reviews on this page; a lot of people found _Mermaids_ very moving, and just because it's not my cup of tea doesn't mean it's not yours.	2001-12-02

Five stars for the sheer beauty of this book, but I found myself mentally correcting the text as I read.  There are lots of books out there that give a better account of the Celts' history.  Recommended only if it's on sale, and only if you have some knowledge about the Celtic tribes before cracking the cover, so you can take some things with a grain of salt.  If the previous two conditions are met, this is a gorgeous coffee-table book with absolutely exquisite photos of landscapes and of ancient Celtic artwork and jewelry.  It feels like the author wanted to make a photography book, but felt the need to fill it with text.  Much better if you just look at the stunning pictures.	2001-12-02
US	49828549	R2ESVGRYGKW4IM	0618150730	245463133	The Perilous Gard	Books	5	84	85	N	N	The Good Stuff	_The Perilous Gard_ is technically a young-adult book, but don't let that discourage any of you adults out there.  Yes, it's totally PG; there is nothing in it that's inappropriate for a middle-schooler.  And yet, it is still emotionally complex enough to satisfy an adult; in fact, it's more complex than many &quot;adult&quot; novels I've read.<br />_The Perilous Gard_ is based on several traditional English and Scottish ballads, mainly Tam Lin.  Elizabeth Pope further fleshes out the ballad's structure by rooting its elements in even older legends and traditions; the magical well that is the entrance to the faerie land is straight out of the Mabinogion, and the Faerie Queen's sinister plans for her handsome captive echo the ancient Celtic tradition of the sacred king's sacrifice.  And all of this comes together to make perfect sense; the Celtic framework provides the background information that the ballad lacked.<br />Into this magical world comes Kate, a wonderful heroine who is challenged over and over, and meets every test with amazing emotional strength.  She proves herself the equal of the faerie folk when she is kidnapped into their land; later she stands up bravely to save her friend Christopher when he is to be sacrificed.  In this version of Tam Lin, the &quot;holding fast&quot; that Kate must do is symbolic and psychological; the guy doesn't actually turn into wild animals and stuff, and what happens instead is even better.  And the ending--the ending is PERFECT.  I don't think I've ever read a better ending, in any novel.  Kate shows her true strength and mettle, and everything turns out exactly right.  I won't give it away, but there is a great sense of &quot;rightness&quot; at the end.  This is the good stuff.	2001-11-27

It's a fairly standard princess-rescuing sort of fairy tale, starring a young man who chooses adventure over good sense, and is rewarded for it.<br />Then comes &quot;Gode's Story&quot;, also from _Possession_, which is about a man who returns from sea to find his lover deeply changed.  It was great within the setting of the novel, and set the mood perfectly when Christabel traveled to Brittany, but standing alone it's a rather depressing story.  It works better in context.<br />&quot;The Tale of the Eldest Princess&quot; is simply delightful.  The princess goes out on a quest, keenly aware that the eldest child in stories always fails in his or her quest, and usually because of arrogance.  This is the story of how the princess consciously tries to make the story go differently this time.  In the end she finds something she didn't even know she was looking for.<br />&quot;Dragon's Breath&quot; is a story of bored villagers who gain a new perspective after volcanic creatures destroy most of their town; suddenly they come alive again with tales of tragedy, heroism, and dumb luck.  Suddenly they see value in what they have.  Seems awfully prophetic, considering this was published three years ago.<br />Finally, we come to the title story, &quot;The Djinn in the Nightingale's Eye&quot;, which is a lush and romantic tale about a middle-aged professor who goes to a conference in Istanbul, and buys a pretty glass bottle that just happens to contain a djinn.  It's a sensual and enchanting tale of a woman learning new things about herself.  It is so richly written that Byatt can refer to the remote control as &quot;the black lozenge&quot; without sounding ridiculous.  We are immersed in a world of hotels and shops, described so lushly that they feel like scenes from Arabian Nights tales of many years ago, despite their modernity.  And while we know, from other tales, what the woman's third wish will be, the ending is written beautifully and doesn't feel cliched.  <br />All in all, a wonderful collection of tales.	2001-11-27

On the surface level, it's a retelling of the story of Swan Lake, a tale of shapeshifting. Lackey moves further into the theme of change, as we follow the development of two interesting characters. She moves the Princess Odette into a more supporting role, focusing instead on Prince Siegfried and on Odile, the daughter of the evil sorcerer Rothbart. Siegfried is a chauvinist pig and a one-time rapist, in danger of becoming a true villain, when he goes through a haunting and a religious experience, and begins to try to live a better life. Odile is an aloof sorceress-in-training who initially idolizes her father and disdains Odette and the other swan-maidens; as the story progresses, she comes to know both Rothbart and Odette much better, and realizes who really cares about her and who does not. She opens up more to emotion, as she learns how to have friends. <br />Oh, yeah, and besides all this stuffy English-major thematic stuff, I would like to mention that it's an immensely enjoyable book, and a lot of fun to read.<br />Why not five stars?  I subtracted a star because I don't believe the shapeshifting spell was described very well.  The girls are supposed to remain swans unless Odette can keep a man faithful for a month--but on the day Siegfried first proposes, the girls talk about how this might be their last night under the spell.  And the spell is supposed to change the swans back into maidens from moonrise to moonset--but Lackey always has them as humans by night ans swans by day.  The moon rises at different times throughout the month; it's only at the full moon that it rises as the sun sets.  So technically they should have transformed at different times of day throughout the month.  But don't mind my nitpicking.  It's a good story anyway.	2001-11-20

However, it wasn't the enchantment I expected. Mostly I think that's because of the klunky historical detail that hit me over the head like an anvil every couple of words. No one ever just walks across the room in this book; they walk in their Authentic Japanese Shoes across the Authentic Japanese Floor, and arrive at the other side of the room, where they sit down on an Authentic Japanese Piece of Furniture. Dalkey wants to immerse us in the period; instead it feels like a history lecture at times. I contrast this with Ellen Steiber's novella &quot;The Fox Wife&quot;--in Steiber's story, we know full well that we're in feudal Japan, but the detail is subtle and flows naturally with the story. (To find &quot;The Fox Wife&quot;, see the anthology _Ruby Slippers, Golden Tears_.) I also felt that the characters could have been developed more; the most interesting characters are the poet Shonasaki (who has only a sidekick's role), and Amaterasu, who's a goddess and not a &quot;character&quot; as such. Uguisu, the protagonist, just seems to be an innocuously nice girl who plays the flute much too well for a beginner, and once in a while shows some backbone that she keeps hidden the rest of the time.<br />Kudos, though, to the storyline involving Amaterasu (fun!) and the way the Uguisu/Takenoko/Emperor love triangle was resolved; it was done in a way that was true to the characters, rather than being formulaic. The book gets much better in the last section.<br />Also, if you get the chance, read her later short story &quot;The Chrysanthemum Robe&quot;, in the anthology _The Armless Maiden_.  It is better-written than  this novel, and the story is absolutely heartbreaking.	2001-11-20

The &quot;outer&quot; story involves two academics who work together in an uneasy partnership to investigate a love affair between the two poets that they respectively study.  Roland is an awkward and poverty-stricken grad student who has no job prospects and a girlfriend he is shamefully unable to appreciate; Maud is a standoffish and icy professor who keeps her inner self veiled for reasons of her own.  Together they follow the paper trail left by the two poets, and in those letters and poems lie the second story, the story of an acclaimed Romantic poet and his more obscure friend, a reclusive female poet who writes something like Dickinson most of the time.  Roland and Maud are trying to be the first to publish their discovery, so they do some impulsive things and create a lot of chaos as they try to keep other professors from scooping them.  Woven into all this literary jumble is the tale of the fairy shapeshifter Melusine; the female poet wrote an epic about her, and both the poet and Maud play the role of Melusine, in various ways, in their own lives.  <br />This isn't a light read, by any means.  I always say that I have two different moods when it comes to reading.  Sometimes I just want to unwind and be entertained; any amusing brain-candy will do.  In other moods, I want to be intellectually challenged.  This book is for the latter mood.	2001-11-18

She skips classes, stays out all night, and basically spends her first semester constantly drunk.  Into this haze come the ethereal Oliver and the seductive Angelica, who become her best friends, and with both of whom Sweeney falls in love.  The only trouble is, the school is controlled by an Illuminati-esque secret society; Angelica is a chosen avatar of a vengeful goddess; and Oliver is marked as her first sacrifice.  This situation plays out tragically, and a shaken Sweeney transfers to another school, where she gets her degree and settles into &quot;normal&quot; life.  Then, eighteen years later, her college ghosts come back to haunt her, as old friends come out of the woodwork, and Angelica prepares for the final denouement with the secret society.  Sweeney is suddenly back in the mysterious world she glimpsed as a teenager.  <br />Mixed in with this hypnotically written story is a political battle between the Matriarchy (represented by Angelica) and the Patriarchy (the secret society); between the Goddess and the world that has ignored her for millennia.  One of the best touches of Hand's book is that she doesn't really take sides, except maybe to hint that the fault of both philosophies is the extremes they go to.  Even when Sweeney makes her decision at the end, she makes it for personal reasons and not because she agrees with either side.  This was the book that got me investigating Goddess mythology several years ago, and it's also a fever-dream of a story, with a sympathetic heroine and a unique style.  I've read it a gazillion times.	2001-11-07

Maybe that's why I love _The Armless Maiden_. The tales and poems here do include sex and violence, yes, but at their heart is the triumph of the human spirit. <br />If we look carefully at fairy tales, many of them are actually about what we would now call child abuse. Cinderella was neglected. Handel and Gretel were abandoned. Donkeyskin suffered incest. And there are so many more. And in most of the stories, the protagonist rises above the situation somehow--in the old versions, usually by gaining fortune and position. In the stories in _The Armless Maiden_, the triumph is more often psychological. I read once--I think it was in a book by Marina Warner--that the essential theme of the fairy tale is transformation. In these stories, we see victims transformed into survivors. <br />These are serious fairy tales for our times, and I recommend the book both to abuse survivors and to those who did not suffer abuse (trust me, everyone knows someone who did). My personal favorite contributions are Emma Bull's poem about Cinderella's stepsister regretting the friendship they never had, and Ellen Kushner's &quot;Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep&quot;, the story of a young girl in the custody of a cold-hearted guardian, and haunted by the ghost of the woman's unhappy daughter.	2001-11-05

In the other, a young gay man is kicked out of his house and is taken in by a charismatic musician.  His new friend becomes his lover and introduces him to all his friends; they become his new family.  Then they all start dying of AIDS.  The two stories, on the surface, are nothing alike, but Kerr weaves them together in subtle and surprising ways, showing the common theme between them: that love may or may not conquer all, but it can keep hope and beauty alive even in tragedy.  This book broke my heart and then fused it back together.  Passionately recommended.	2001-11-05

Andrews ever wrote.&quot;  Yes, I know this is a completely different author, but all of the same plot devices crop up here.  An innocent young girl loses both her parents in a horrific murder-suicide.  She goes to live with her oppressive grandmother and her    spoiled, spiteful cousin.  The heroine is a promising pianist, but of course, tragedy gets in the way of that.  Then, she falls in love with the henpecked fiance' of aforementioned spoiled spiteful cousin.

Many years later, the heroine's daughter is in danger of being drawn into the sordid life of the spoiled, selfish cousin.    Fans of the _Dawn_ series will love this.  I loved Andrews as much as the next girl when I was in high school, and I was deeply engrossed in this book while I was reading it.  I was in tears as the love interest finally said the words he should have said MANY years before.  However, I was left with a sour taste after the book was over.  I always feel a bit manipulated by novels that seem to be an endless litany of sadness.  Yes, _Summer of the Flamingoes_ tugs at the heartstrings, but the theme of the book seems to be, mainly, &quot;The heroine's cousin and grandmother, are really rotten, aren't they?&quot;	2001-11-04

Unfortunately, they are their normal selves, not their powerful alter egos, and so they are in a magical medieval kingdom without magical abilities, weapons skills, or even decent horsemanship. And the catch is that everyone expects them to know these things--since their characters do. They get by, becoming involved in court intrigue while trying to stay out of trouble by quick thinking and by calling on their knowledge of the way the world works. And then the world starts to change, with characters and objects behaving in ways they never thought of in their game. This book is a role-player's dream, and perhaps nightmare as well. Pamela Dean once again shows herself a master of characterization, especially in her portrayal of the luckless, klutzy Laura, who just may be more than she seems to be. I just hope there's a sequel, since the story ends just when you'd expect it to start heading for a climax. And for some reason, it leaves me intrigued and fascinated, rather than annoyed.	2001-11-03

But one night, she stumbles drunkenly into Faery.  Upon hearing that the faery princess of Ottawa has been abducted by the evil Unseelie Court, she volunteers for a rescue mission--despite the fact that every Seelie faery in the city has chickened out and called it a lost cause.  She joins forces with some interesting friends, and through luck and resourcefulness, fights the Unseelie Court.   Jacky and her best friend, Kate Crackernuts, are wonderful characters, and I was glad to see them in the sequel, _Drink Down the Moon_, the other novel included in this book.<br />Unfortunately, _Drink Down the Moon_ is a little bit of a letdown after _Jack the Giant Killer_.  It's still a three- or four-star book in its own right, but it wouldn't stand very well on its own, and Jacky and Kate have too-small roles.  The novel's finest moments are those in which Jacky or Kate or both are present, but in _Drink Down the Moon_, Jacky herself has become the &quot;rescue-fodder&quot;, and center stage is taken by characters that fail to engage the reader quite as much.  I had hoped to see more of Eilian as well.  What I really want is for de Lint to write a third installment, in which Jacky and Kate are prominent again, and perhaps challenge the Seelie Court itself, and ask the Laird a few hard questions--like why he's always out of town when he's needed most.	2001-11-02

Choosing home, we believe, leads to isolation and boredom, and feeling trapped within the world of housekeeping.  (think The Feminine Mystique).  Choosing career means personal fulfillment but often loneliness.  And most women, out of necessity, juggle both, a formidable workload.  Noragh Jones presents us with a different worldview here, one where the community it so tight-knit that &quot;hearth-keeping&quot; is both a private and a public lifestyle, and in which domestic work is sacred rather than drudgery.  In &quot;Power of Raven, Wisdom of Serpent&quot;, Jones has picked out the chants and prayers from the Carmina Gadelica that are most closely related to women's lives, and shows how they enriched the farm women's daily routine with a numinous holiness.  Here are prayers to be said for every task done, as well as love poems, healing lore, and rites of passage.  I found the last to be the most interesting; there are folk christening rites that blend the pagan and Christian; wedding songs, prayers for the child leaving home, and funeral laments.  I don't know if I could have handled the sheer amount of work these farming women did.  They worked hard and endlessly, but every moment was filled with meaning.  Jones brings to life the essence of Celtic Christianity--that God is not only &quot;up there&quot;, but present in every ordinary moment.	2001-10-30

Louise Lawrence presents us with a variation on the Tam Lin story, as the dark queen chooses her man and is challenged by his mortal sweetheart.<br />The idea was a good one, but the novel could have been done better. The characters are bare sketches at the time events begin to unfold, leaving us with a hard time relating to them. We know Owen is a classic &quot;nice guy&quot; who will do anything for anyone. We know Kate loves Owen. We know Jonathan is an immature jerk. That's about it. It would be easier to care about the characters if they were more fleshed-out. Lawrence also has a tendency to tell rather than show; several characters make long-winded speeches in which they explain what's going on, when the reader can basically figure that out on her/his own. What I did like were the descriptions--Lawrence really brings the seasons to life, as the year turns. I also liked the ambivalence of Kate's character at the end; I'll try not to spoil the ending, but I will say that it becomes clear that Kate is not a &quot;safer&quot; choice than the Earth Witch, and that in fact she carries some of the witch's power.<br />A quick read, and not bad for a moody October evening.	2001-10-30

I couldn't have been further from the truth.  Jennifer Reif has created a true gem among neo-pagan books.  From the fragmentary information we have about the Demeter and Persephone holidays of ancient Greece, Reif constructs a coherent Wheel of the Year mythos that follows the agricultural year, and follows Demeter through the loss of her daughter, her mourning, and her reconciliation with Persephone and Plouton (who isn't the scary guy we expect).  She also explains how to adjust the festival calendar if , like me, you don't live in a Mediterranean climate.   Reif is full of practical instructions; she devoted chapters to growing grain and making various altar objects that you might desire.  I only wish the rituals were more oriented toward the solitary, but with a little imagination, most of them are probably do-able.  Bravo to Jennifer Reif, for writing a book both practical and scholarly.  This book is for real.	2001-10-18

(It's very Wiccan-oriented, so if you're not into Wicca, you might not like the way the rituals are set up.)  Gail Wood's love of the Dark Goddess and the Dark Moon is evident throughout the book; you can tell this is a path she herself has explored, found rewarding, and now wants to share with others.  The book focuses on ritual and meditation; the rituals are simple enough that anyone can do them.  You don't need any props except your mind and soul.  Even if you just read your first Wicca book last week, there won't be anything to confuse you.  And no matter how long you've been on the path, there will be something here for you.  There are many resources in print and online with ritual outlines for the various Full Moons of the year; *Sisters* is especially welcome because the Dark Moon is often overlooked.  Each ritual is based on the zodiac sign in which the Dark Moon falls, and is self-exploratory and uplifting.  Wood compares the Dark to the attic where we keep things we don't think we need or value; these rituals help us find those hidden beauties within ourselves.  In the end, Wood helps us with that difficult task, &quot;Know thyself&quot;.  All in all, a gentle and beautiful book, with something for everyone.  The only thing that could have improved it would be a chart of the Dark Moons for the next several years, and the signs they fall into.  For the dates of the Dark Moons, try any almanac or witches' calendar; to determine the astrological signs, I recommend Daniel Pharr's *Moon Wise*, a book about lunar astrology in general, and including a lunar ephemeris.	2001-10-15

He starts with the basic lore about the phases--about the properties of the waxing, full, waning, and dark moon.  He goes on to talk about moon signs and what they mean; he describes the personality traits of people born under each moon sign, and goes even deeper by detailing how a person born under each sign will likely react and feel as the moon enters each of the zodiac signs.  For example, if your moon sign is Aries, you might have some struggles when the moon enters watery Cancer; having that knowledge can help you deal with the emotions.  Pharr advises keeping a moon diary in which you keep track of the moon's sign and how your mood and energy levels are affected by it.  Included is a lunar ephemeris; with a little bit of math you can determine the moon's sign at any given moment.	2001-10-15

One of the major ideas contained in _Aradia_ is that money is not the only kind of power, that our power comes from ourselves and the Gods, if we dare to grasp it.  <br />I also like _Aradia_ for its weird spells.  Yes, there are some cursing spells here, which I wouldn't recommdn using except in dire circumstances, but that's my own opinion.  There are also spells for gaining beauty, comminucating with a lover through dreams, and (something most Pagans can appreciate) finding cheap used books.  There is also an absolutely beautiful invocation to Diana the moon goddess.  Many of the spells and incantations are embedded in folk tales; some are moving, others are just plain entertaining.  <br />This book is also historically interesting; it's where Doreen Valiente got many of her ideas when she was writing the early Wiccan liturgy.  Highly recommended.	2001-10-15

This probably wasn't fair; I enjoyed the book the entire time I was reading it, and then panned it because I thought the ending seemed tacked-on and disappointing, and because I felt that the romance between the central characters was not well-developed.  I recently re-read the book, and remembered why I had enjoyed it so much in the first place.<br />_Tam Lin_ is beautifully written--you can just see the scenery, and the characters will remind you of people you know. Every college dorm is full of weird people.  (I know; I was one of them.)  It's also uproariously funny; I got some strange looks from my fiance' as I read it, because I was bursting out into laughter.  Basically, the first nine-tenths of the book is an entertaining account of a life at college, with hints of the supernatural.  Then, the supernatural takes over when Janet becomes involved with Thomas, the \\"Tam Lin\\" character who is in danger of being sacrificed to Hell by the Faery Queen.<br />I still think that the romance between Janet and Thomas feels a little sudden, since there are only a few hints early in the book that there was chemistry between the two.  I'm inclined to be more generous than I was earlier, though.  After all, in real life, we don't always get lots of advance warning about these things.  The abruptness of the beginning of the relationship might even make the climax more believable--if Thomas was Janet's long-term boyfriend, there would have been no mixed feelings to complicate Janet's decisions.  The choice would have been clear.  As it happened, she didn't know whether to believe him, or whether to take the chance of confronting the Queen.  <br />So, after a second read, I'll have to rate this a pretty good book.  There are still a few minor plot holes and loose ends, but _Tam Lin_ ain't bad at all.	2001-10-09
US	49828549	RP3WOQ5VDEWZ8	1572810661	472839166	The Goddess Tarot Deck	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Beautiful	I have been drooling over this deck for a long time, and I finally got my hands on it! Often a deck is disappointing after the anticipation has ended, but I haven't changed my mind about the Goddess Tarot.<br />The Majors have, for the most part, the standard meanings, though each figure is replaced by a Goddess who represents the concept of the card. For example, the Hierophant becomes &quot;Tradition&quot; and is represented by Juno, and the High Priestess is &quot;Wisdom&quot;, and features Sarasvati. They are lovely art-wise, and my only complaint is that they tend to sugarcoat a few of the darker cards. But then, I gripe about every deck in which Death is called something other than Death. Waldherr calls it Transformation. It's a peeve of mine, but the meaning is the same, and the Goddess pictured, Ukemochi, works well--she was killed, and food plants sprouted forth from her body. Life from death. It's a slightly Pollyanna-ish interpretation of the card, but it's OK.<br />I've heard people griping about the Minors on various web sites, but I personally like these. They are mostly re-paintings of the Pamela Smith cards, which means they're easy to learn and interpret. Their beauty stirs the imagination and really involves your emotions in the reading, and their gentle colors are comforting.<br />All in all, one of my favorite decks.	2001-09-29

It caught my attention initially because the cover illustration was a detail from John Duncan's &quot;The Coming of Bride&quot;. It turns out that this is a collection of Scottish myths compiled from the oral tradition. I tried very hard not to jump up and down in the store; Scottish material is, for some reason, not the easiest to find. The collection begins with the story of Beira, queen of winter, and her battles with Angus and Bride, the lovers who bring sunny weather in spring. I've often heard this story alluded to, and read a summary of it in other books such as Monaghan's *Goddesses and Heroines*, but never before did I get the chance to read the whole story, and it is beautiful. Most of the other tales in this collection, while less well-known, are also good reads. Recommended for a variety of people--scholars, pagans, and anyone who wants cool stories to read to their kids.<br />UPDATE:  Apparently, this is condensed from *Scottish Wonder Tales from Myth and Legend*, which is currently in print.  I haven't read the larger book, but I'd definitely recommend it after what I've seen so far.	2001-09-07

I bought the Motherpeace deck several months ago during a moment of anti-patriarchal fervor. I had just read the book written for this deck, &quot;Motherpeace, A Way to the Goddess...&quot; along with several other radical feminist books. It suited my mood at the time; the deck is inspiring, comforting, and thought-provoking to a person who is angry about the way the world is set up. Most of the time, I don't lend much thought-space to matriarchy-versus-patriarchy concerns, since I personally am happier if I concentrate on the present, warts and all, than on whether or not this massive cultural shift occurred in the dimly remembered past. The Motherpeace deck focuses on warm, loving communities of women; the only men are in the Courts and in the Emperor, Hierophant, and Devil. The Courts are mixed; some are nice guys and some are stereotypical patriarchal jerks. The Emperor, Hierophant, and Devil are all portrayed as oppressors. To my mind, this takes some of the subtlety and deeper meaning out of the cards; in a tarot reading any card can be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;, depending on context. When I'm in a bad mood, this deck can help me mentally vent. Otherwise, I tend to use decks with more ambiguous symbolism and better art.	2001-08-24

The Majors are pretty much standard fare; the figures are in the usual poses, although they are shown as belonging to diverse ethnic groups. For example, the woman depicted on Strength is African; the Empress evokes the Middle Eastern mother goddesses; the Star is a Native American. This is one of the few decks I've seen where the Minors are better than the Majors. The artist and author assign a culture to each of the suits: Egyptian and sub-Saharan African cultures for the Staves; Japanese feudalism for the Swords; the Arthurian legend of Britain for the Cups, and a Native American vision quest for the Sacred Circles (pentacles, traditionally). The art is beautiful, and the pictures evoke deep spiritual meaning. Even the suit of Earth (the Sacred Circles), generally interpreted as being &quot;about money&quot;, is here a profound exploration of community, resources, isolation, and discovery.  Tracey Hoover, the writer of the accompanying booklet, recommends going through the Minors in reverse order, from 10 to Ace. Going through the Sacred Circles, you see the focus shifting from a community to an individual, a young woman who draws aside into seclusion to meet her spirit guide. I'm no Native American expert, but the cards are moving nonetheless. And all of the other suits are just as good. Because every card carries a deep meaning, this is more a deck for spiritual concerns than for mundane ones. Highly recommended to anyone who uses the Tarot for mystical purposes.	2001-08-24

She bases her meanings for the Minor Arcana solely on numerology rather than visual cues; her meanings for the cards are based on what the numbers mean to her. The result is an unusually positive meaning for each card--a little bit politically correct, IMHO. 5 of Pentacles? You're not having financial trouble, you're just going through a period of re-adjustment! *chuckle* While I'm sure these meanings would give a different slant to a tarot reading, I don't use them much because some of them differ vastly from the traditional meanings and from the artwork in my decks. I'm more story- and picture- oriented than number-oriented; I want to look at a card and sense its meaning intuitively, rather than having to look up a number in a book. The card itself, rather than any book, is the biggest clue to its meaning--at least the way I work. But there is room for all opinions, and besides, this book would work well if you were reading a deck with pips, or an ordinary playing card deck. Fairfield's system wasn't my cup of tea, but that doesn't mean it won't be yours. The true treasure of this book is the last several chapters, which focus on doing readings. She provides suggestions about creating your own layouts, using the tarot for dream analysis, using the tarot to clarify yourself in a discussion, etc. She encourages the reader to do things her/his own way. And I can't argue with that.	2001-08-24

Based primarily on Rider-Waite-Smith, it's eclectic and easy to learn. The Majors, especially, are heavily derived from Smith's artwork, but Steventon's style is much more elaborate and magical. I can't describe it very well; check out a tarot review site for pictures. While she draws heavily on Smith, Steventon makes several of the cards unmistakably her own. The Devil is one innovation--old Beelzebub is holding up a mirror, and the woman in the mirror blocks her reflection from her own sight. The Minors are done in a 19th-century style; some of the cards are clearly based on Impressionistic, Romantic, and Pre-Raphaelite works. For example, the 3 of Pentacles pictures a ballet dancer and reminds one of Degas's art, while the 8 of Cups is reminiscent of Rossetti's &quot;Proserpina&quot;. Most of the cards are beautiful and evocative. The deck is not overly religious or political, and so is useful for any question and any querent. I recommend it to anyone; a beginner and an advanced reader could probably both enjoy this deck.	2001-08-24

The book was useful for reading any deck--the meanings correspond most closely, of course, with the Motherpeace deck, but they can also add a different flavor to a reading with any deck. Motherpeace, as you probably already know, is a deck that focuses on ancient matriarchal culture and its contact with patriarchy. History doesn't tell us much, but a woman angry at the world can find some comfort in the theory anyway. The Motherpeace book will add a slant to your reading that will give you a sense of power--whether you possess worldly power or not. And it may give you a sense of hope about the kind of society we could build if we'd stop fighting. And, politics aside, it's a pretty solid tarot book in general.	2001-08-24

Franklin and Mason have tossed aside all the Cabalistic and Golden Dawn symbolism you're used to; all of the symbolism you'll see here is derived from Celtic folklore.  There is a lot of attention to detail--the cards are replete with Celtic sacred sites, animals, and plants.   Everything you'll see is very thought-out and well-researched.<br />The cards are done using modern computer-imaging techniques.  Many of them are stunningly beautiful (the High Priestess, which could be an alternate cover for Mists of Avalon), many are very evocative of their meaning (Initiation, which is represented by a labyrinth leading to the Cauldron of Ceridwen).  The Majors, for the most part, are great.  Getting into the Minors, the Cups are especially gorgeous, while the Discs occasionally leave me cold.  Some of the cards aren't very intuitive, but that's not a big deal since this is one of the decks that provides a little one-word caption on the card to help you out.  All in all, a solid and beautiful deck.	2001-08-19

Renee has written an excellent book that gets down to practical neamings of each card.  She is coming from the perspective of &quot;advice&quot; readings, where you consult the cards in order to tackle a particular problem.  Each card, including the often-neglected Minor Arcana, is examined in detail, and treated as advice you could take in a situation.  You drew the 4 of Pentacles?  Time to hold on to your resources and focus on security.  The 6 of Pentacles?  Now is the time to be generous.  None of the cards are treated as &quot;bad&quot; cards, because--to use a cliche--to everything there is a season.    This isn't an arcane, solemn tome about the Journey of the Fool and the mythical archetypes he runs into along the way; it's about your journey through your own life, and your own life situations both mundane and spiritual.   Great for beginners and experienced readers alike.	2001-08-19

Unlike the I Ching, though, the messages are all based on Celtic archetypes and symbols, like &quot;Hag the Initiator&quot;, &quot;The Wondrous Child&quot;, &quot;Sacred Wells&quot;, and so on.  Each message is illustrated with a pretty black-and-white drawing, and contains a lot of background about the symbol or archetype.  Then it tells you what the symbol means in terms of the reading.  *Celtic Oracles* has a feminist slant, just for your information.  It also acknowledges both Christianity and Paganism.  Coming from either point of view, anyone interested in applying Celtic archetypes to her/his life will enjoy this.	2001-08-14

The blurb on the back, the quoted reviews on the cover, and the introduction all state that Goodrich offers proof here of the historical Queen.  I had just finished the wonderful *Journey to Avalon* by Barber and Pykitt, which is full of information on the probable figure behind Arthur, but which only devotes a few paragraphs to his wife.  So, I was looking for some more information about her.<br />Goodrich doesn't dig into archaeology or history, though; the entire book is based on two medieval writings, the &quot;Prose Lancelot&quot; and the work of Geoffrey of Monmouth, and takes these works as absolute fact.  She delves into confusing episodes in the epics, and into symbols the writers associate with Guinevere, and attempts to find the roots underlying them.  Since much medieval romance was based on an earlier oral tradition, that's all fine and good--except that the more Goodrich finds, the less historical it sounds.  Instead of Gwenhwyfar, queen of the Britons, we get Guanhumara, goddess of death and initiation, a mythic rather than a historical figure.  Now, I don't generally mind mythic explorations onto the Arthur legends.  I gave the Matthews' *Ladies of the Lake* five stars.  But the Matthews were up-front about what they were doing.  Yes, the Arthur cycle is based both on history and myth.  But don't promise me history and give me myth.	2001-08-09

It is a good murder mystery, but unlike an ordinary mystery, you can reread it, even knowing whodunit, without any of the fun being spoiled.  The mystery is sort of a backdrop to the real show--which is yet another new take on the personalities of Arthurian legend, and a different look at chivalric ideals.<br />The narrator is the oft-maligned Sir Kay, the grouchy but well-meaning seneschal of Arthur's court.  He's not a bad guy.  He *is* a sarcastic curmudgeon, but that's because he's seen so many self-serving buffoons win glory and adulation while his own hard work goes unnoticed.  He is also secretly in love with the Queen.  Kay shares an uneasy friendship with a wonderfully written, morbid, fatalistic, and somehow sympathetic Sir Mordred.  Together they set out to clear Guenevere's name of the murder charges, meeting fascinating characters right and left.  Morgan and Iblis are especially engaging, and Karr puts some deep words into their mouths.  Morgan's defense of her mixed Christian and pagan ways cuts right to the heart of things, and Iblis's observation that justice is different for women than for men, is shocking just because it is so true of the times.<br />If you're an Arthurian buff, read this book.  It's a quick read, and a great way to spend a lazy afternoon or two.	2001-08-05

Evans-Wentz was a sophisticated scholar, and yet treated faery beliefs with the utmost of respect, and even devoted a chapter to scientific and psychological findings that render such beliefs valid.  Without looking down his nose on anyone (except maybe stuffy fellow scholars who lost their imagination somewhere along the line), he reports stories of faery encounters in every Celtic nation.  He interviewed great numbers of Celtic people in his travels, and collected a vast treasure trove of tales.  These range from firsthand accounts to &quot;a friend of a friend&quot; legends to stories handed down through the generations.<br />After presenting a mass of information on the modern faery faith, he goes on to relate the ancient faery beliefs held by the Celts of old, as recorded in their mythology.  Many pages are devoted to the adventures of CuChulainn, Arthur, Bran, and other figures who moved in and out of the Otherworld.  He also discusses the Otherworld itself, the misty land where the faeries, the gods, and the dead dwelled.  Especially stunning is his assertion that the Celts participated in mysteries much like those of Eleusis.  The mythological evidence IS THERE, as Evans-Wentz proves.  I only wish someone in those days had written something down to indicate whether or not this is true!   <br />This is the best book ever written on the fae, IMHO.  It ought to be on every Celtophile's shelf right next to Squire's _Celtic Myth and Legend_.  As a matter of fact, the two books make excellent companions for one another.	2001-07-28

It *is* true, however.  _Russian Folk Belief_ is fascinating and engaging from the first page to the last, if you are interested in myth, religion, or the faery world.  Drawing from history and from personal testimony, Ivanits puts together a chronicle of the beliefs of the Russians as they were converted to Christianity--albeit a sometimes unusual Christianity in which much old pagan belief remained.  The book talks about the pagan faith of the Russian lands, and the major holidays associated with that faith, and then talks about the Russian Orthodox church and the *un*orthodox religion still practiced in some rural areas.  Ivanits has put together a large collection of folk tales rich with faeries, witches, and sorcerers.   If you  are interested in the pagan gods and faeries of Russia, this book is a must-have.	2001-07-27

I've always been better with stories than with numbers, so I've had trouble with the tarot for a long time. I never quite *got* numerology, so I'd sit there reading various tarot guidebooks and wondering, &quot;But WHY does the three mean such-and-such? And how am I supposed to remember that?&quot; The book that accompanies the Mythic Tarot solved that problem for me. The authors' great idea was to choose a Greek story to illustrate each suit, and the cards are major events in the story. Since I can remember how the story goes, it's so much easier to call to mind the meanings of the Minor Arcana. The authors spoke my language, if you will. And if you're more story-oriented than number-oriented, it will help you as well. Even when using another deck, the Mythic book makes a great mnemonic aid.<br />The cards aren't bad either. Most of the best are to be found in the Major Arcana. The High Priestess, The Empress, and Temperance are a few of my favorites. The Minors sometimes look a little weird because the figures seem to be stiffly posed. This isn't a problem in the Majors since most of them are standing still anyway, but when the people are supposed to be fighting or murdering or even conversing, they look a little stiff. Still, the cards are evocative, and you know at first glance the basic &quot;mood&quot; of the card. <br />I would have given the deck five stars, but the quality of the materials isn't great. The book is already looking shabby. The cards could have been made on better stock. I have small hands, and I can't shuffle most decks in the normal way; I'm a big proponent of the &quot;mess them around in a big pile&quot; school of thought. But my friend shuffled them once; she has larger hands and shuffled them normally, and one of the cards now has a white worn spot on its back, where the black dye was worn away by just a few shufflings. The publishers could have done better. Five stars for the authors and artist; two or three for the publishers.	2001-07-27

Well, actually, it's not a new guess.  For a long time, it was assumed that Athrwys ap Meurig *was* Arthur, but that idea fell out of favor due to dating problems.  Here, Barber and Pykitt resurrect the Athrwys theory, explaining the confusion that led to some historians' belief that Athrwys lived a century too late.  They add in a new revelation: according to this book, Arthur was also St Armel, whom the Bretons revere just as much as they do Arthur, not realizing they're the same guy!  (This isn't a spoiler.  These assertions are made in the first chapter; the rest of the book is devoted to proof and to investigating other pieces of the legend, like the location of Avalon, and the identity of some of the Knights of Camelot.)  <br />It's a fascinating theory; unfortunately, the writing runs a little dry at times, becoming an interminable list of &quot;begats&quot;.  This kind of tangible proof is necessary when setting forth theories, I know.  It's just that it doesn't always make for easy reading.  This is a scholarly book more than it is an entertaining one; read it when you're in a &quot;brainy mood.&quot;<br />In the end, Barber and Pykitt may be right about the original personage of Arthur.  However, the legendary Arthur is a composite figure and can't be reduced to one historical man; he is an amalgam of several historical kings and a couple of pagan Welsh gods.  The fact that some of the major events of &quot;Arthur's&quot; life are explained here as historical events does nothing to diminish the legendary king's mystique.	2001-07-27

It has its amazing moments and its less-than-amazing moments.  I especially like the idea of faerie tales as meditation exercises; the legends and fantasies dreamed up over the centuries might well be our best key to the nature of the fae.  The meditations are also good; I especially liked &quot;Meeting the Flower Faeries&quot; and &quot;Tree Faeries.&quot;  I only wish the list of flowers and trees had been longer, but the meditations can be used with any plant, so that's no big deal.  <br />Unfortunately, much of the book is devoted to a hyper-organized approach to the fae.  There is too much ceremonial magic and not enough whimsy or wild magic.  Note that the high points I mentioned above are also the moments in which the book is given over mainly to wild magic.  In my work with the fae, I've never gotten the idea that they're a strict bureaucracy.  They aren't that organized, and trying to organize them just misses the point.  The fae *aren't* like us.  They're wilder and more unpredictable, and I bet there are a lot of fae giggling a bit at parts of this book.<br />I also don't like the emphasis on using the fae to work on your psychological issues.  If you're going to get to know the fae, it's best to get to know them just for the joy of getting to know them.  And, yes, that *will* make your life happier and more interesting, but that is just icing on the cake.  Don't use the fae; befriend them.	2001-07-26

It's about the size of a woman's hand, and half of its thickness is its cover.  I suppose the consumer is paying extra for the pretty cover; it's too small a book to cost this much.<br />Second, this is a book that you yourself could write in just a few days.  Unless you're a small child or have been a lifelong atheist, I'm sure you know how to pray.  Just start talking!  Seriously.  Your words are as valid--and probably more meaningful to you--than what is to be found here.	2001-07-23
US	49828549	R1ZTVCQIHSJAR1	0850308437	690612554	The Arthurian Tarot	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Well done	_The Arthurian Tarot_ goes deeply into Arthurian myth and the older Welsh legends that lie beneath the surface.  The artwork is beautiful, and the book, while not as detailed as the corresponding &quot;workbook&quot;, _Hallowquest_, is still much better-written than the scanty booklets that come with most tarot decks.  Each Major Arcana card is explained with a page or two of information; the Minor meanings are brief, but tell you what story the image is drawn from.  The book also includes several new spreads specifically designed for this deck.<br />The Majors depict prominent characters, places, or events in Arthurian myth; the court cards are also representative of chcracters from the legends.  The Minors do not depict people, which makes them a little harder to interpret, but the landscapes and scenes do suggest the general mood of the card.  <br />The Arthurian Tarot requires a little more homework than the average Tarot deck, but in my opinion it's worth it.	2001-07-15

I still go back and reread parts of it.  There are other parts I never reread.  <br />Why I liked this book:  First, it's hilarious at times.  Unlike another reviewer, I loved the Q-Celtic rap; it was a very funny modernization of the very real insult wars Celtic women had with one another.  In another writer's hands, the scene might have been too archaic in tone to really express the humor and sarcasm the women used.  I loved Bran's self-introduction.  I loved the scene where Esus takes the Druid &quot;entrance exam.&quot;  The beginning of the book is a laugh riot, for the most part.  Toward the middle and end, it took on a more serious tone, and it is a testament to the author's skill that the two &quot;moods&quot; did not clash; the book flowed naturally from comedy to drama.  I don't want to spoil the plot for anyone, but the heroic plot cooked up by Maeve and Dwynwyn is worth the price of the book all by itself.  The courage and cleverness the women show is my _other_ favorite aspect of _Daughter of the Shining Isles_.  This is the story of a young girl growing into a powerful and strong woman, and what a fascinating story it is!<br />What I didn't like:  I thought the urination and menstruation jokes were excessive.  Not that there's anything wrong with bodily functions--we all have them--but we're talking overkill here.	2001-07-15
US	49828549	R2VK64UDS1FAQ	0062516329	128410882	The Spiral Dance: A Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Goddess: 20th Anniversary Edition	Books	4	23	26	N	N	Solid but controversial	OK, I'll say this up-front.  Starhawk is very, very political.  She is a strong proponent of feminism and the environment.  She is out to change societal sex-role conditioning for both males and females.  She uses Dion Fortune's definition of magic, &quot;the art of changing consciousness at will&quot;, and interprets it to mean both magical and political consciousness.  If you're dead-set against ecofeminism, maybe you shouldn't read this book.  If you prefer not to mix your spirituality with your politics, you might have to skip some chapters.  If you tune out whenever psychobabble commences, you may have to skip some chapters.  That said, let's go on...<br />One of the reasons _The Spiral Dance_ has become such a classic in NeoPagan circles is its &quot;magic education&quot; exercises.  Starhawk gives the reader &quot;homework&quot; in energy-raising, concentration, grounding and centering, trance, and more.  This is the most complete source I have seen on this kind of work.  Her exercises have been borrowed and recycled in many more recent books.  If you've read any Wicca 101 books, you've probably read versions of Starhawk's exercises, whether you know it or not.  All of them are useful in some way, and can help you learn to use the powers of your mind for magic.<br />I also must rave about the breathtaking beauty Starhawk's language achieves from time to time.  I'm a woman, so I don't know what a man feels when reading this book, but I find it a wonderful mood-booster when I'm going through tough times.  Just read the passage beginning, &quot;Mother Goddess is awakening, and we can begin to reclaim our primal birthright, the sheer intoxicating joy of being alive.&quot;  Just read some of the ritual poetry written by Starhawk and her coven.  The goosebumps on your arms and the tears in your eyes--now that's magic.  <br />Starhawk envisions a world transformed by spiritual power, a world where women are strong and powerful and comfortable in their bodies, and aworld where men are free of the urge to &quot;one-up&quot; each other and free to show emotion.  It's an inspiring idea.  If you like this sort of thing, or if you want a comprehensive set of magical exercises, or if you want to read some gorgeously written Pagan rituals, by all means, get a copy of this classic.	2001-07-14

Halfway through the book, Glyn &quot;drops out&quot; when he marries a non-pagan, and the rest of the letters are written only to Tessa.  Within this framework, Beth explains the Craft, as one other reviewer put it, as if you were learning it over tea at someone's table.  This is how I imagine it would feel to be taught by your grandmother in a family tradition, something most witches aren't fortunate enough to experience.<br />Beth's correspondence includes a letter about each Sabbat, explaining how she celebrates and giving her students ideas for adapting the traditions to suit their own needs.  Each of these chapters includes a full ritual, and unlike some of the more &quot;formal&quot; Wicca 101 books, the rituals are presented in an open-ended manner.  They are merely suggestions, not prescribed lists of archaic-sounding incantations to be said in a specific order.  They're just Beth's ideas, and she presents them as such.  <br />Other subjects she deals with are trance-work and the deities.  Her letters on trance-work are wonderful, and gave me tons of ideas.  In her writings about the deities, she is as open-ended as she is about everything else, not giving them specific names, but leaving that up to the preference of the practitioner.  <br />If you're looking for a book of formal rituals and formulaic spells, this isn't the book for you.  If you want to learn the Craft the way your grandmother would have taught it, pull up a blanket, grab a cup of hot chocolate, and settle into a comfy chair with _The Wiccan Path_.	2001-07-14

And I tried to read this one.....The 21 Lessons of Merlyn is confusing, incoherent, and sexist.  I can't follow this book from one paragraph to the next, since it doesn't seem to be organized very well.  It skips from topic to topic.  And, the author seems to look down his nose at women.  He suggests that the young boy's \\"girls are icky\\" attitude is actually the proper attitude for a grown man, and that socialization is to blame for any attraction a man may feel for a woman.  He claims that no one can become a powerful magician if he \\"depletes his power\\" through sex.  This book has turned several women of my aqcuaintance away from the Celtic path, and that's sad.  If you must read this, make sure you read some other Celtic books first, so you don't come away with the impression that this system is the one and only Celtic way.	2001-07-14

Maybe _the_ best.  Everyone who is a mythophile or a Celtophile should have a copy of this.<br />That said, it isn't perfect.  Most of the flaws in it can be traced to the time in which it was written (1912).  First, it stretches too far to compare everything to a Greek or Roman myth.  To call the Dagda &quot;Zeus&quot; or Branwen &quot;Aphrodite&quot; is a little inaccurate, in my opinion, but I try to keep in mind the fact that he was presenting the Celtic myths to an audience obsessed with Greek myths.  He even mentioned in his foreword that part of the reason for writing the book is because he was bored with poets' constant classical allusions, and wanted to give them a fresh well of legend on whicb to draw.  So, in drawing parallels between Celtic and Greek myth, he was probably just trying to translate the Celtic myths into a format that his audience would understand.<br />The second, and more serious, gripe is Squire's anti-paganism.  He buys into every rumor ever spread about Druidic human sacrifice.  While at least one body has been found which was probably the victim of sacrifice, there is no evidence I've seen to indicate that the Celtic religion was the bloodbath it has sometimes been made out to be.  Human sacrifice seems to have been present but very rare.  Squire loves the Celts' stories, but tends to present the people themselves as bloodthirsty savages in dire need of Christianity to &quot;civilize&quot; them.  Again, this may just be a product of Squire's times; he might have had to bash paganism just to get his book published in those days. Or the stories of widespread sacrifice may have been more commonly accepted as historical fact.  I don't know.  But if you can take his bias with a grain of salt, this is an excellent resource for anyone interested in Celtic myth.	2001-07-13

This book looked really good when I bought it.  It promised to make me &quot;the equivalent of the Third Degree&quot; after I completed all of the lessons, and the lessons seemed to span a wide variety of subjects.  <br />The lessons did include many different &quot;witchy&quot; practices, from energy-raising to herbalism to palmistry, giving the reader a little knowledge of each one.  However, I don't think a little knowledge of a lot of things necessarily makes me some sort of &quot;advanced&quot; Witch.  Eventually, one has to specialize, and go deeply into aspects of the Craft, and to go deeply into any aspect of the Craft, one must go beyond this book.  This is more like a guided tour through the practices of Witchcraft, and any further exploring is up to you.  Maybe this book can make you the equivalent of the First Degree.  I don't know, since I don't belong to a tradition that awards degrees, but this stuff just doesn't _seem_ advanced enough to merit a Third Degree.  It's not bad as a beginner's book, though I've seen more inspiring and passionate ones (try Starhawk, Rae Beth, Scott Cunningham, Phyllis Curott, or Yasmine Galenorn).  If you're not a beginner, don't waste your money buying this--it won't help you advance any further.  I wouldn't be upset if it had been presented as a beginners' book, but the promise of &quot;Third Degree&quot; knowledge implied that it was also useful for a more advanced practitioner.<br />The second problem I have with the book is Buckland's ego.  He seems determined to prove what an important Craft elder he is.  In one of the first chapters, he presents the history of the modern Craft, with a quiz about influential figures in the pagan revival.  Guess who one of them is?  And when he goes into the Sabbat rituals, he makes a point out of saying, in effect, &quot;Hey look, my Sabbat rituals are so much better-written than the ones from the Gardnerian tradition.&quot;  Even when it's not this explicit, everything he says seemsto carry an undercurrent of &quot;My way is THE way.&quot;   After a while, it just got on my nerves.	2001-07-12

Unfortunately, the Celtic legends have been revised, sanitized, and edited over the centuries to the point that sometimes they can seem very dry--as if all the spirit has been sucked out of them.  <br />And then there's _On the Edge of Dream_.<br />Jennifer Heath draws on the oral tradition of stories handed down by her mother, plus written sources, blending different versions of stories together into an enchanting brew.  She doesn't just retell the stories the way we've always heard them, she spices them up, adds a dash of feminism here and there, and breathes new emotional life into them.  I cry every time I read the scene where Pwyll, lacking the words to apologize to Rhiannon, simply carries her into the court, the way she has carried all visitors for the past seven years.<br />You'll especially like this if you liked Caitlin Matthews' _Celtic Love_.  Both are collections of old Celtic stories told with new-found emotional &quot;oomph&quot; by women with true bardic talent.	2001-07-12

But I'll try to write a review, and say something original.<br />This book focuses on the period in the life cycle that comes between death and rebirth.  The Dark Moon, the time when the moon wanes to invisibility before reappearing, is the metaphor George uses for this phase of the cycle.  Other &quot;Dark Moon&quot; periods include: the time between Samhain and the Winter Solstice; the seed's dormancy in the ground before sprouting; the menstrual period; and any time in our own lives when one stage of life ends and the next is yet to begin.  (And, of course, the literal meaning--the period after physical death, when no one knows for sure what happens.  This is the true Mystery of human existence.)<br />Ancient Goddesses of death and regeneration are invoked here, as guides through our &quot;dark times&quot;.  We approach these times with negative emotions now, since we've been taught to think of time as linear rather than cyclical--but the Goddesses teach us that although one thing has ended, something new will begin.  And in the meantime, we need to rest, withdraw, and regenerate.  During the Dark Moon, we regroup in preparation for rebirth.  When we understand this concept, we begin to approach times of &quot;death&quot; with optimism rather than depression.  This book will help you relax and &quot;go with the flow&quot;.	2001-07-12

Yasmine Galenorn has done a great service for the Neo-Pagan community with this book.  It's too bad it's out of print.<br />In _Trancing the Witch's Wheel_, Galenorn presents a set of guided meditations to connect with the four elements and several deities, and to celebrate the Wheel of the Year.  The Wheel meditations take up the bulk of the book, and are beautiful and inspiring.  A Witch in the broom closet can perform many of these rituals completely without props or tools.  A Witch who prefers trance work to &quot;standing at the altar chanting&quot; sorts of rituals will find meaningful practices for the Sabbats here.  And, one can easily adapt the meditations to one's own practice.  For example, you can rewrite the Beltane meditation to honor the Goddess and God of your pantheon, if Aphrodite and Pan don't suit you.  Her meditations can be a jumping-off point for lots of meaningful trance work.  At the end of each meditation, Galenorn suggests further activities, both magical and mundane, to help you further experience the energies you are invoking.<br />_Trancing_ is the only book of its kind that I know of, and is a solid addition to any Witch's bookshelf.	2001-07-12

For every woman who seeks a significant other to &quot;complete&quot; her, for every woman who feels the need to live vicariously through her children, and for every woman who feels like she is &quot;asleep&quot; as she goes about her daily life, PLEASE read this book.<br />Following the myth of Rhiannon as an outline, Elsbeth and Johnson lead the reader through a story of a woman coming into her power.  Every woman has felt that she was forced to give up some precious part of herself at some point; that feeling of incompleteness can simmer and seethe, leading to depression, neurosis, or violence when she finally &quot;snaps&quot;.  Or, the woman can look deep within herself, face some tough questions, and come to realize that her &quot;self&quot; was never lost at all, and can be awakened through meditation and dreams.  The meditations presented here are useful, but simply reading the text _without_ doing any of the meditations can be invaluable.  This is a book of empowerment.  Read it, and realize that you are complete in yourself--and in your new-found self-esteem, you won't need anyone else to complete you.  And when you don't _need_ others, then you are truly free to _love_ them as people.<br />The use of the Celtic myths as a metaphor for the journey will draw in a crowd of mainly Pagan women, but any woman can benefit from this book.  Read it, and find your power.	2001-07-11

This was the first book I bought on the subject of Celtic paganism, and I have mixed feelings about it. It isn't _good_, but it isn't exactly _bad_ either. (...)This book won't hinder your spiritual search, and hopefully it will help in some way.<br />The book begins with a generalized, idealized history of the Celtic peoples, focusing too much on the Irish Celts, and presenting Celtic society as some sort of utopia. But I'm sure readers will realize this is too good to be entirely true, and look to other sources for their history.<br />There is also a section on Celtic myths and deities. This is mostly taken from Charles Squire's book of Celtic myths, a book MUCH LARGER than the single chapter in which Conway tries to impart the same amount of information. The result is choppy and hurried, and reminds me of those term papers I wrote in the ninth grade, in which I tried to narrate the history of the world in 5 pages. There is just enough information on each deity to maybe capture the reader's interest in two or three of them, and hopefully this will lead the reader to books that go deeper into the myths.<br />The most useful parts of the book are the sections on rituals and spells. They're not ancient Celtic rites; they're modern Wiccan practices adapted for the Celtic-influenced Wiccan. For a beginner just starting out in Wicca, they are simple enough to perform right away, and easy to adapt and modify once the beginner advances a little and wants to try her own hand at ritual-writing. They can serve as the skeleton of a Celtic Wiccan practice, and be fleshed out by the practitioner. <br />If you're advanced within Celtic-influenced Wicca or another Celtic-based path, don't read this book. There's nothing new in it for you. If you're a beginner, you might find this useful, as I did when I started out. Hopefully, the tantalizing glimpses you catch of the Celtic deities in this book will inspire a deeper search.	2001-07-11

It is, bar none, the best book about Celtic traditions I've seen yet, and I've read a lot of them--the good, the bad, and the ugly.   <br />Kondratiev is not afraid of controversy; he spends the beginning of the book expressing some strong opinions.  A person wishing to use Celtic spirituality, he asserts, should become a defender of Celtic ways on the more mundane and political level as well.  Most importantly, the Celtophile should learn one of the six Celtic languages, since they, along with the worldview they describe, are rapidly disappearing as people begin to speak only English or French in the Celtic nations.  And he's probably right.  One should embrace all of Celtic culture, not just the &quot;fun stuff&quot;, if s/he wants to embrace the spirituality.<br />The rest of the book is concerned with spiritual rituals for the major earth holidays of the Wheel of the Year, and rituals for the lunar cycles.  Kondratiev gathers together huge amounts of information from both Pagan and Christian traditions.  He examines the way the holidays are celebrated and were celebrated in the past, and draws parallels between the traditions and mythic stories that may be related.  In this way, he gives each festival a &quot;story&quot; or two that illustrates its meaning.  Then, he gives a sample ritual as performed by his circle, Celi De.  The best way to describe it is that it's similar to the Farrars' _Eight Sabbats for Witches_, only better--both more scholarly and more emotional, two qualities often difficult to combine.<br />This book is invaluable for anyone wishing to delve deeply into Celtic spirituality.  It's out of print, but try to find it wherever you can.  You won't regret it.	2001-07-08
US	49828549	RL7HBOFISYH64	0892811501	907229400	Women of the Celts	Books	4	72	72	N	N	Celtic myth meets social theory	This book was a surprise to me--I expected a book of mythology, and instead it was a book of psychological, sociological, and philosophical theory with Celtic mythological overtones.  Its structure reminded me of Simone de Beauvoir's _The Second Sex_, a book which Markale quotes often.  _Women of the Celts_ begins with a historical discourse on the role of women in ancient Celtic society, and then studies myths centered around female characters in a search for subconscious attitudes about women.  Reading _The Second Sex_ may be helpful to understanding _Women of the Celts_; having read De Beauvoir's book first gives the reader a sense of &quot;OK, I know where this is going.&quot;  <br />Markale discusses the role of women in the various Celtic societies without generalizing or idealizing; he spends many pages on each of the Celtic lands, and focuses on specific legal codes that concerned women's rights and limitations.  His studies reveal a people caught somewhere between equality and sexism; women still held nearly equal rights with men but were losing ground.  <br />He then launches into several chapters of comparative mythology, seeking common archetypes that can be found in many Celtic stories, such as  &quot;The Submerged Princess&quot;, &quot;The Great Queen&quot;, &quot;Our Lady of the Night&quot;, &quot;The Rebellion of the Flower-Daughter&quot;, and &quot;The Lady of the Orchard.&quot;  He draws parallels between the various stories and looks for the psychological undertones.   The conclusion he finally draws is that men both desire and fear a deep union with a woman; and that this union leads to a true understanding of what is truly important in life.  When a person is truly in love, the workaday world loses the meaning it formerly held.<br />In the third section of the book, Markale outlines his new vision for a more sexually equal society, based on some of the ideas held by the ancient Celts.  His theory would take too long to explain here, but it is interesting and thought-provoking.<br />I give this book four stars for its scholarship, the interesting nature of the Celtic stories, and for the very thought-provoking social theories suggested at the end.  I have only two gripes.  (1)Markale can get very long-winded and &quot;high-falutin&quot; at times, leaving the reader wondering, &quot;Where is he going with this?&quot;  (2)I think Markale may be overgenerous in his application of Freudian &quot;Oedipal complex&quot; theory.  After a while, the reader also wonders, &quot;Can every last Celtic myth really be about man's desire for sexual union with his mother?&quot;  But, in the end, the focus is not on incest, but on the union-in-love that returns the lover to a state of bliss and understanding.	2001-07-06

First, it pleasantly surprised me by assuming a working knowledge of \\"Wicca 101\\" and didn't spend the first five chapters rehashing \\"How to Cast a Circle.\\" If you need that information, you can find it in the appendices; if you have already read some of the gazillions of Wicca 101 books on the market, you can just start at the beginning of the book and jump right into the new material. Reading on, it was chock-full of suggestions on how to incorporate ancient Celtic ideas into a modern spirituality that can be meaningful to women today, including guided meditations, rituals, folk spells, a neo-pagan calendar of Celtic women's festivals, and an absolutely tear-jerking \\"soul-friend\\" bonding ritual.<br />.... I see nothing in the book to indicate that McCoy is trying to pass this material off as ancient. On the contrary, whenever she discusses a concept that has no known basis in ancient Celtic history, she says so. It is important to preserve all the history we can, as a basis for our spirituality; it is also important to build upon that history, adapting and creating new rituals to make the ancient concepts more meaningful to us today. We need to look to both the past and the future. This book is not intended to be a book of history, but a book of dreams, designed to inspire modern women in their quest for meaningful new rituals. So, I say, read historical works on the Celts, and read this too. <br />It's also been said that McCoy is lumping together very different Celtic cultures into one homogeneous culture that never really existed. Actually, the only place where that generalization is used is in the title. She comes straight out and says that the Celts were nowhere near as unified as we sometimes think, and whenever she mentions a specific Goddess, she says \\"So-and-so, an Irish/Cornish/Welsh/Continental/etc. Goddess\\", not \\"Celtic Goddess.\\" She is concerned with the common threads that the cultures _did_ havein common, but she keeps her pantheons straight.<br />My only gripe: There were a few errors that could have been caught in editing. For example, the name Cormac was used for Conchobar a couple of times. However, a reader with a working knowledge of the myths can easily mentally correct these arrors and read on.	2001-07-01

There are also several smaller poems, including an invocation to &quot;the Gods of Night.&quot;  I came across this book in a used bookstore, and snapped it up--I am an incorrigible mythology buff, and it's not every day you find a collection of primary sources like this one.<br />The Babylonian creation myth is the story of the hero-god Marduk's defeat of the chaos goddess Tiamat.  Sandars explains that the myth covers an older layer--the remnants of the time in which the Goddess was supreme and complex, and in which there were many more gods, their powers later being assimilated into the figure of Marduk.<br />The Descent of Inanna details that goddess's journey into the underworld, where she is killed and held prisoner by her sister, the death-goddess Ereshkigal, and is finally rescued by Enki, who sends two spirits to console Ereshkigal in the pains of childbirth.  As a reward, she gives them Inanna as a gift, and the goddess of life is restored to the upper world.  The idea of the death goddess giving birth as Inanna is revived is an evocative image--is it Inanna who is being born here?  Echoes of the later Eleusinian mysteries, in which Persephone was said to give birth in the underworld.  Food for thought.  The legend also includes several similar accounts of the capture of Dumuzi, Inanna's husband, who is forced to take Inanna's place in hell.<br />A fascinating hodgepodge, this book has a place of honor on my shelf.	2001-06-02

Reading the &quot;historical information&quot; preceding the rituals, I realized it was a fabrication--there were too many little discrepancies and plot holes, most of which I can't recall offhand.  Looking through the full _Necronomicon_ later on, I came to the came conclusion about the larger book.  This Simon guy cobbled the books together using Lovecraft's work, his own imagination, and a bit of real Sumerian mythology.<br />Yes, there is something real here.  Several years after consigning the _Necronomicon Spellbook_ to the bottom of a box in my closet, I read the Babylonian creation myth, as found in _Poems of Heaven and Hell from Ancient Mesopotamia_ by N.K. Sandars.  After Marduk slays the chaos-mother Tiamat, the other gods honor him by giving him fifty names.  Sandars says that the names actually belong to earlier gods who were assimilated into the figure of Marduk.  As I read the list of names, I found that most of them were identical to the Fifty Names listed in the _Spellbook_, and some of the attributions were similar.  The Names are real, and belong to Mesopotamian gods who were actually worshipped at one time.  Simon evidently read the myth and made use of it.<br />Simon's rituals may or may not be a load of hooey.  If they work for you, so be it.  He probably made them up, but that doesn't mean they don't work.  Still, I'd recommend reading the Babylonian creation myth instead--go straight to the primary source if you want to know about Marduk's fifty names.	2001-06-02

The basic premise of this book is that both Paganism and Christianity can be &quot;right&quot;.  DiZerega posits that the two traditions have more in common than they realize, and that both paths are valid for those who follow them.  There is a place in this world for both religions.<br />Being a Wiccan himself, diZerega focuses mainly on Pagan beliefs.  He explains what Pagans believe, and rebuts Christian misconceptions of Paganism, in a well-documented text that is intelligently written and yet not pedantic.  He also challenges the belief that Christianity is the one true way, using both Scripture and his own beliefs to back up his claim.  <br />I would recommend this book to any Christian who has a Pagan child, significant other, or friend.  Unfortunately, the Christians who truly need this book are of the closed-minded variety and wouldn't be listening anyway.  If you believe that all Pagans are going to Hell, you aren't going to read this book, and even if you do, you won't consider its arguments.  &quot;Satanic propaganda, no doubt.&quot;  And the open-minded Christians who are willing to accept Paganism as a valid spiritual path for some?  They don't need this book.  They already know there is a placxe in the world for many different belief systems.  If certain uber-conservative political figures were to read this book and truly consider it, the US might be a better place.  But they won't.  Mostly, Pagans and open-minded Christians will read it.  DiZerega is preaching to the choir.	2001-05-12

I liked that she only spent a small part of the  book explaining the meanings of certain symbols; most dream books are  dictionaries of meanings that may or may not be true, depending on the  person doing the dreaming.  There is no one meaning for a symbol that is  true for everyone.  Nahmad encourages you to interpret the symbols for  yourself--since no one else can know your own psyche as well as  you.<br />There are also several spells in the book, all of which are  beautifully written and evocative.  There is a spell to ask for a dream to  illuminate your situation; a spell to heal a friend on the dream plane; a  spell to protect yourself from incubi and succubi.  The most valuable (and  simplest) of the spells, perhaps, she calls the King Solomon and Queen of  Sheba Spell; it is designed to get your subconscious mind and conscious  mind working together.<br />My only gripe is that this book is too short!	2000-09-17

I've been hauling  it around in my purse since the day I bought it, and reading and rereading  bits of it every time I get the chance.<br />Here are myths often overlooked,  since they do not fit the traditional Wiccan worldview and stereotypes  about the masculine and feminine forces.

I raised an eyebrow at first when I saw that they were populated by dragons and unicorns and other denizens of fairy tales, but this is not a reason to  look down on these cards.  When we read tarot, we tap into our subconscious  mind for answers.  Our subconscious minds are full of mythical beasts like  unicorns.  If they weren't galloping around in the collective unconscious,  there wouldn't be tales about them going back to Biblical times.  Plus, the  familiarity we have with such animals from childhood helps us interpret  them.  When Sweikhardt says that dragons represent danger and temptation,  we intuitively understand!  When we see a castle on the horizon in a card,  just visible through a mire of forest, we remember Sleeping Beauty's prince  and his determination.  Fairy tale images may seem childish on the surface,  but they stir up deep currents within us.  And when your subconscious is  fully involved, you're often going to get an eerily accurate reading.<br />One  touch I love in these cards, especially as a witch and a worshipper of the  moon goddess in her phases, is that almost every card in the deck has a  moon somewhere in the scene.  &quot;Positive&quot; cards, those which  indicate growth and joy, tend to have waxing moons on them.  The Ten of  Swords, Death, and other traditionally &quot;negative&quot; cards bear a  waning crescent.  Many Major Arcana and cards indicating major forces at  work have a full moon illuminating the scene.  And what's even more fun:  When the cards are reversed, a waxing moon becomes a waning moon and vice  versa, showing the reversal of the energy the card represents!<br />I love  this deck.  It's not for everyone.  If you sneer at anything that smacks of  your childhood dreams, this deck is not for you.  If you want to tap into  the power of those old dreams, give it a try.	2000-07-28

Conway has the best of intentions with this book. She does a wonderful job of clearing up misconceptions about the God, and writes in an inspiring and beautiful manner about the various archetypes she explores. Also included are meditations for further exploration of the God archetypes.<br />The only downfall of this book is that she tries to encompass more Gods than can be adequately dealt with in a book of this size. Once she gets past the initial explanation of an archetype, she dives into brief &quot;capsule biographies&quot; of the gods which embody that archetype, skimming through each god in a few sentences. The mythology is choppy, and there are a few minor factual errors. However, this probably isn't Conway's fault; there are just too many Gods to fit into a book of this size. Nevertheless, it inspired me to learn more. Use this book as a first step into pagan God spirituality, then go out and delve deeper.<br />Addendum:  Upon rereading this book, I came to a conclusion:  It would have been much better if it had been presented in an encyclopedic format, like Monaghan's _Goddesses and Heroines_.  It comes across as choppy because Conway segues from one god to the next without any real transition; in an encyclopedic format that wouldn't be a problem.  She does include a brief compendium in the back of _Lord of Light and Shadow_, and an expanded version of that would have made a better book.	2000-06-15

The authors take stories of influential women fromthe Arthurian legends and frame their tales in the context of the Goddess mythology that lies behind the legends.  They explain how each Lady  of the Lake is actually a disguised version of a Goddess archetype, thinly  veiled by later patriarchal tradition.  Wonderful for anyone who loves  mythology.  Also includes guided visualizations dealing with the women,  which explore the reader's own psyche as well as the archetypes.  I  devoured it.	2000-04-08

It gives information on the gods, goddesses, heroes, and Sabbats that is more in-depth than most books give, and its exercises are interesting ones.  You will explore, through trance, the mythic history of the land of Ireland as well as your personal history, and you will learn to meet deities and other astral beings via meditation.<br />However, the book's downfall lies in Blamires' implicit assertion that his way is the only way to Celtic spirituality. He calls his system &quot;THE Irish system&quot; (emphasis mine) and says that if you can't or don't want to do his exercises, then you just aren't ready for the rigors of Irish spirituality. He doesn't acknowledge that there are many paths, not just his own.<br />This aside, it is a useful resource if you can get past that, or if his particular spirituality is exactly what you're looking for. I did what I always do with books on magic--sift out what I don't like and keep what works for me.	2000-03-24
