Ideally, this book should be used to prevent injuries, especially those caused by overexertion.  FIT TO PADDLE provides a sports specific conditioning program which will keep all types of paddlers in top paddling form. The book also includes sample home workout programs and a chart of the muscular system.<br /><br />I highly suggest this book for all paddlers who are looking to build strength, flexibility and endurance, increase balance and coordination and help prevent overexertion injuries.

The exercises can be performed at home, at the gym or on the water.<br /><br />This is a great resource for all recreational and/or competitive paddlers.	2004-09-07

These odd tales weave themes of magic, taboo, old age and death throughout. They are derived from a remote land and a highly imaginative oral tradition.<br />To give you an idea, some of the specific stories describe men who marry rocks and old people who marry insects, children who grow antlers, children who eat their parents, animals who steal body parts from human corpses and women with iron tails.<br />This collection is a great read, (...and not for the queasy).<br />Highly recommended for any kayakers with a fascination for Greenland and Innuit history &amp; culture	2003-12-05

The accounts detail what the residents like and don't like about Ocracoke living, the reasons some have transplanted themselves there and their predictions and hopes about the island's future in this age of soaring real estate prices and commercial over development.<br />The book provides a very interesting look at the Ocracoke island life from those who have lived it.	2003-05-29

In this guide, Killen takes a relatively bland, technical subject matter and uses the same witty linguistic style that he uses to teach his very popular instructional courses.  In addition to providing the basics of kayak navigation in an &quot;easy to understand&quot; manner, Killen's book provides an enjoyable read.<br />I highly recommend this navigational primer for any beginning sea kayaker who plans to drop a paddle in any tidal river, bay or ocean.  I also recommend Killens book as a prerequisite to David Burch's more comprehensive and detailed &quot;Fundamentals of Kayak Navigation&quot;.	2002-10-15

Riding on the NJ Turnpike, and amidst the backdrop of the Manahttan Skyline, the Meadowlands looks like an appealing natural area to paddle (..at least from a paddler's perspective). Although the area is historically notorious for being one of the most polluted in the state, I've often seen many wading birds feeding in the area so I figured \\"how bad could it be?\\"<br />Robert Sullivan answers this question in an entertaining account of his canoe expeditions in this area. His trek through the muck and mire lead him on searches for Jimmy Hoffa's body and other 'treasures'while also detailing the local history of the area and the mob related lore of the garbage and solid waste disposal industry. His graphic and detailed accounts of the garbage that have been dumped in the area would make any paddler seriously consider whether they should paddle it. At the same time, Sullivan has also created a curiosity which has motivated more people than ever before to pick up a paddle and check it out.<br />Beyond the humorous account of his adventure, this book is an easy read that makes us more aware of the vast natural area we have abused and taken for granted. Hopefully it will inspire people to assist restorative and preservation efforts of this area of great potential, preventing it from becoming a continued dumpsite or concrete jungle.	2001-08-15

The book is simple and concise.

(For those not familiar with Nealy, this book is not meant to be a technical  river guide).  Although some of the rapids he highlights have been significantly altered by mother nature over the last 20 years, the reader still gets a  humorous look at the  &quot;hydro-namics&quot; of the various rapids on the rivers he describes.  In addition to his commentary on the rapids of each river, Nealy also includes his trademark comical sketches which have helped make his books so popular.<br />Like his other classic kayaking books, this is a comic book river guide for the Southeast Rivers. (Rivers included are the Cheat, Chatahoochee, Chatooga, French Broad, Gauley, Haw, Hiawasee, Locust Fork, Nantahala, New River Gorge, Nolichucky, Savage and Youghiogheny.)  Paddlers will appreciate the descriptions of the rivers, some b/w photos and the comical sketches of the major rapids of each river.  In addition he also includes a funny glossary section of  river and paddling terminology with his highly opinionated sociocultural paddling commentary  offered throughout.<br />As paddlesports are becoming increasingly popular and thus &quot;more commercially marketable&quot; in the US, Nealy's books and commentary are becoming even more funny, more meaningful and somewhat prophetic.	2001-02-18

His introduction to the Four Noble Truths is simply written,  easy to understand, and yet lacks not one bit in depth.  Like all his books,  this one helps us to integrate Buddhist ideas into our everyday life without becoming too encumbered with terminology.  Although Thich Nhat Hanh does tend to repeat himself in subtle ways, within this book and across his other books, The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching seems to integrate many of his ideas into one very coherent and practical treatise on the nature suffering as one of the most basic human conditions we spend our lives trying to accept, or possibly escape.<br />He makes the Buddhist concepts of attachment to objects and people very clear in  relationship to human suffering and then highlights the path of well-being, peace and liberation from it.<br />If I was stuck on an island and could bring a few books, this would be one at the top of the list.  It's a reminder that much our our suffering is self created and an illusion.  In the same way we imprison ourselves mentally, is the way we begin to liberate ourselves.  Freedom and liberation come from within and are possible even under the most extreme, excruciating and trying conditions.<br />I highly recommend this book, and especially to those who are having difficulty dealing with the loss of a loved one (or loss in general) and those who are imprisoned mentally (with fear), or even physically incarcerated.	2001-02-10

In addition, each chapter  also provides exercises that allow us to  search for and accept all our positive and untapped potentials that prevent us from living a genuinely satisfying life and engaging in authentic relationships withourselves and others.<br />Shadow Dance is an exciting journey of mindfulness that takes you  into the untapped areas of your mind and soul.	2001-01-27

The Science of Homeopathy is a classic text which will significantly impact the way you view health and illness.<br />I highly recommend this book for any academic scholar who is dissatisfied with our current and ailing system of allopathic medicine or who is interested in simply knowing more than what homeopathy is. It is only for the seriously interested layperson however, as it is may be considered a 'technical and highly challenging read.<br />The Science of Homeopathy has profound implications for the future of health care AND for the evolution of the human organism.	2001-01-18

This book is required reading for anyone having an academic or clinical  interest in homeopathy and for those interested in the science and theory of a truly holistic oriented approach to illness and health.  Although this book might be somewhat difficult to comprehend and digest for the layperson, it's well worth the challenging read.<br />In this text, Vithoulkas relates many of our current diseases such as cancer, aids, asthma, epilepsy, schizophrenia and dementia (along with many others) to the weakening of the immunity system and discusses the role of the overprescription of drugs such as antibiotics in this process.<br />I agree with Vithoulkas.  Only when Western medicine  incorporates homeopathic principles into its system and integrates the role of the psyche, spirit and emotions into theories of illness and health can we begin to develop more holistic forms of treatment.	2001-01-18

He also gives quite  a menu for musical pieces to give strength and courage, facilitate clear thinking and release anger.<br />Unfortunately, beyond mostly classical music, other genres of music are either omitted altogether or are severely underrepresented.  He does however include a chapter representing some world music, women's music and the music of nature.  An interesting chapter on personality temperaments, musical preference and the elements of fire, water, air and earth is also included but not enough to save this book from a severe lack of diversity in musical style.<br />After a chapter that basically bastardizes rock and roll, it becomes clear that Lingerman (who is also a minister) is on his own subtle musical pulpit.  The music he preaches and advocates is without a doubt, slanted towards the classical genre and angelic in nature.  Jazz compositions are virtually omitted altogether.<br />A good book for those with a preference for  receiving the healing energy of classical music.	2001-01-15

In this book he examines why this occurs.  Storr's 'Solitude' makes a philosphical and psychological examination of the therapeutic value of isolation,  its effect on imagination, creativity, self actualization and general well being.  It also highlights implications of extreme forms and discusses the benefit in times of grief, loss and suffering.<br />Storr illustrates his ideas with some  rich examples and quotes from famed artists, writers, composers and other creative people regarding how their creative processes, works, temperaments and lives have been influenced by their solitude or by their lack thereof.<br />While highlighting the creative utility and positive contributions of solitude on the 'self', this book in no way devalues the need for  relationships.  I like the idea that solitude is rather, part of a process which by making us more authentic, makes our relationships with others and our world more genuine and satisfying.	2000-11-08

Her essays illustrate issues of sexual abuse, misogyny and corporate greed (just to name a few) and confront the bitter realities of society that many try hard to deny or keep out of the comfort zone of awareness. This is a raw uncensored cathartic tirade of a woman \\"checking some major emotional baggage\\". If you can't handle hearing of harsh realities of life and vulgar words, this book is not for you. I personally, found the profanity somewhat excessive, (minus two stars) and this is a major part of her method here. Some parts made me angry, but other parts had me laughing hysterically. This book is bound to invoke and trigger some strong thoughts and feelings relating to your own issues (if you are willing to admit you have any).<br />If you can get past the shock of the sensationalized vulgarity and barrage of four letter words & slang body part names without abandoning the book, you will feel the intensity of her angst..(you may even share some). She also includes some humourously vulgar and obnoxious original artwork to add to the 'treatment'.<br />This book will make a great stocking stuffer to instigate any Politically Correct, Ultra Conservative, Right Wing, Anti-Free Speech advocates on your holiday shopping list.	2000-10-21

If you can appreciate short stories dealing with life's simplicities, you will enjoy reading this.  The stories are introspective, cerebral,  life-affirming and emotionally validating, especially for men.  Women readers get an intimate illustration of the workings of the male psyche in the rich detail of Canin's characters and their relationships.<br />In his stories, Canin touches upon relationships, such as those between fathers and sons and also basic but complex emotions such as anger, jealousy, shame and vulnerability.  His men feel  their emotions viscerally and Canin's writing allows you to feel them and also to empathize with each character.  Those  readers capable of empathy and willing to accept their own humanity and vulnerabilities will find the content of these stories somewhat invigorating and far from 'trite'.  Sometimes life's most wonderful or tragic experiences are found in the simplest of events and  the most fleeting of moments. These are the experiences Ethan Canin is concerned with.	2000-10-21

Natalie Goldberg continues to combine her Zen approach and casual style  in these short and easily digestible essays, each with its own suggested exercise for getting your wild mind to flow as fast as your wild hand and pen can keep pace.<br />I used this book as the foundation for a local writing group which has helped some new writers 'bloom like a lotus'.  It is the recipe for  living the writer's life and  it has flavorfully seasoned a few veteran writers and also kept  the group's creative river flowing freely and unobstructed.	2000-09-29
US	49024402	R241J98SOIFRSR	0966465903	851324519	Two Dog River	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Jack Kerouac on the River......A "wet & wild" Adventure	This is one of the best pieces of fiction I have read in a long time and will get your juices flowing faster than a class V rapid. It's the male version of the Harlequin Romance Novel. It's a raw, primitive adrenaline and testosterone pumping journey down an uncharted fictional river and the antics and drama that unfold when the 'boys meet the girls' in their kayaks and rafts on the river..and how they are' transformed' along the way. There's no Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon on this river. The characters, plot and setting are richly developed and erotically intertwined.<br />Parts of the book had me on the edge of my seat, while others had me laughing out loud (which had fellow commuters on my train wondering what I was reading). Beyond it's rich detailing of some of the technical aspects of whitewater river running, this is a story about a quest of mind, body and spirit on the river of life.	2000-09-21

It is an easy read and although it offers very practical  ideas and strategies, it is far more than a practical  &quot;how to&quot; writing guide.  I highly recommend it for beginning writers and those seasoned writers who are experiencing a  loss of momentum, flow, focus or  blocks to creativity.  Deep Writing will  give you the tools to get you started on meaningful &amp; purposeful writing  in addition to helping you remove any  roadblocks to passionate and genuine writing.  While helping you enjoy the process of writing,  Maisel (who is also a psychotherapist)  also helps the you along the process of  'knowing yourself' better.  Some case vignettes of writers and artists he has helped along the way richly add to the utility of his ideas.	2000-09-21

Although it offers very helpful strategies for beginning to write, this book's basic rule is that there are no rules for writing...just do it!  Her  own highly personable style of writing makes Natalie Goldberg your personal writing coach and motivating guide.  She will have you 'writing down your bones' before you even finish reading her book.	2000-09-21
US	49024402	RYCQ5BP5Z5B2Q	1888375086	882977487	Interbeing: Fourteen Guidelines for Engaged Buddhism	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Beyond the &quot;self&quot;....We're all connected	This book definitely helps one see the reality of our &quot;interconnectedness&quot; with others and with our environment and  also illustrates how our actions often have many  implications beyond  &quot;the self&quot;.  The fundamental precepts or mindfulness trainings  outlined and described here, when practiced, have the capacity  to bring  about  positive societal and global change.  This book is another major  step towards understanding, compassion and peace.	2000-09-20

It significantly increased my awareness of how accessible peace of mind, body and spirit is. It reads very easy and the insights are simple observations that in our busy lives, we often forget or take for granted.<br />With mindfulness and some practice of breathing and 'enjoying doing the dishes' we can learn to grow from and fully enjoy the process of living and the diversity of life's experiences. Regardless of your spiritual tradition, and without trying to 'convert you to Buddhism', this book will help you realize that peace of mind, body and spirit is internal and only a breath away.<br />I feel this book promotes world peace, one reader at a time, since peace on earth begins in the heart. I have given many copies as gifts and enjoy hearing how others that I have given the book to are now also passing it along. I especially recommend this book to those who feel they need to slow down (or have been told by others or their doctor that they should). It's time to stop and smell the roses. If you have never read Thich Nhat Hanh...start your journey here.	2000-09-19

The larger than normal type and simple language makes this guide an easy read and a  very  useful one,  especially for those who are new to the sport of  kayaking.  The chapters on safety, rescues and signals could be literal lifesavers and  are essential reading for anyone entering the paddling experience (ok..so  if it saves your life..it's worth the price).  However, if you are  already familiar with the paddling basics (strokes, safety,  etc), there's  nothing much new here, except for some specific information tailored to  sit-on- top type kayaks.  For those planning to paddle in the ocean,  chapters on waves, tides and kayak surfing are useful and  informative.	2000-08-18

Zen and the Heart of Psychotherapy uncovers a process of mutual growth and  transformation that can occur for both the client AND the therapist using  basic Zen  principles and ideas. This book does not get encumbered in  Eastern ambiguity or unnecessary and technical Buddhist semantics.  Regardless of your or your client's spiritual belief system, the ideas  presented can be considered universally and are useful in not only forging  a strong therapeutic alliance in the here and now, but also for faciliating  growth, transformation and healing of mind, body and spirit.	2000-08-13

Down Barnegat Bay: A Nor'easter Midnight Reader is my<br />favorite chronicle of the maritime history and folklore of the Jersey<br />Shore.  The historical narratives catapult the reader into an era when<br />the now densely populated areas along the Barnegat Bay were filled<br />with sailors, fishermen, Indians and farmers.  Tales of shipwrecks,<br />pirates and the Lenni-Lenapi Indians along the Metedeconk River are<br />exciting to read and add immensely to the feeling of being<br />&quot;transported in time&quot; as do the many illustrations that look<br />as if they were taken from a scrapbook in your great grandparent's<br />attic (some of them may have been!).  Down Barnegat Bay gives the<br />reader more than an appreciation for an area so rich in maritime<br />history and folklore..it TAKES them there.<br />For me personally, being<br />an avid and routine paddler of the Jersey Shore, Down Barnegat Bay: A<br />Nor'easter Midnight Reader has transformed my kayak trips on the bay<br />and canoe trips on the peaceful Metedeconk River into a new communion<br />with the Shore area land and sea.  Paddling &quot;Down Barnegat<br />Bay&quot;, I can experience the exciting, life affirming SynchronicitY<br />of the past and present moment.<br />Thank you Robert Jahn.	2000-08-02
