I used this text at work to shape a Cassegrain antenna system and i am very dissapointed by it :  the first problem is that the theoretical explanations that are linked to the programs are either non-existant or sybilline , the second is the programs themselves that depend on unaccounted for parameters . This make working with this text a nightmare of experience ! Do not buy this book , buy instead Craig Scott &quot;Modern Methods of Reflector Antenna Analysis and Design&quot; and develope your own code and you will finish your project a lot faster !	2002-05-23

This book in my opinion is the best book at the entry level for  understanding thermodynamics.Basic concepts like entropy,chemical potential,perfect gas properties,black body and many others are developed here from scratch with a clear approach,emphasizing use of simple mathematical instruments and illustrations.While the point of view of this book is a little eccentric compared to other textbook competing in the same arena,authors have to be praised for their willingness to educate the reader in a realistic and effective way.Special attention is put to elucidate the very important subject of &quot;equilibrium&quot; a much abused but seldom explained concept in physics.As for problems i agree with other reviewers: they are totally out of sync with the excellent level of the book and they only add entropy to the student brain,but this apart this book is great:5 stars!	2000-12-28

This is a very &quot;concrete&quot; and well written book about analog  electronics for students and practicing engineers.The choice of arguments  is well made and up to date placing a special emphasis on circuits at the  analog-digital interface which is really fundamental nowadays.The choice of  the authors is to introduce analysis at the most easy level possible,and  after having developed the basics of a certain subject present different  circuital implementations.Explained examples are extensively used to  develop analytical skills of the reader.I think this book is a natural  choice once you reach the intermediate to advanced level in analog  electronics,Very fine text!	2000-09-05

This book sets a standard in teaching electronics at the university level  :actually i think this text is the best choice if you want to learn analog  electronics at the beginning level and after that is still useful as a  reference.The authors provide an extremely readable material on the main  themes of analog electronics going from the device level to the analysis of  fundamental circuits like amplifiers,filters,mono and bistable  circuits,logic families,operational amplifiers etc.etc.What strikes you is  the super-human ability of the authors to really explain things to you in a  way both easy to understand and informative at the same time.There are many  very fine points like for example a great explanation of feedback related  to circuits which i really enjoyed a lot.I think reading this book is a  great pleasure for everyone that really loves electronics !	2000-09-05

This is quite a good book about the civil war.The author begins making a  complete but contained description of the war causes and then progresses  with a detailed expositions of the main battles.The main emphasis is on a  very detailed account of what happened in the battlefield and why.The  author makes a great use of maps(the book is full of them),psycology (for  example to explain some very strange decisions taken by Mc Clellen)and  military history to enlivens the subject from a realistic point of  view.There are many moments of epics like the disperate Confederate charge  on the Missionary Ridge that the author describes exceptionally well .The  main leaders like Grant,Lee,Jackson,Longstreet,Sherman,Mc Clellan and many  others are suberbly presented and their decisions explained with all the  pro and con.But the author is very near also to the common soldiers  reporting many acts of unbelievable heroism like the texans charge at  Gaines Mill and many others by both sides.And Mr Luraghi always mixes very  effectively the strategic level with the tactical one.The style is  analytical ,coincise but not at all dry.In the end i think this book is  history at his best !	2000-08-30

I first encountered Thucydites in translations(rather difficult) from the  ancient Greek in secondary school in Rome and fell in love with this book  from that time on.Thucydites more or less invented history and separeted  the field from mithology.His accounts concerning the war between Athens and  Sparta for the Greek world leadership are first rate,honest and  accurate.And all this is more surprising knowing that the author was  ostracyzed (exiled) by Athens with charges of incompetence during the  war.In the book there are many very fine points like Perikles speech to  Athenians,the pestilence in Athens,the siege of Syracuse and the  extraordinary account of conctractations between Athenians and the little  island of Melos where the real nature of imperialism is fully  exposed.Reconstruction of battles is very well made and professional.I  think Thucydites's book is still now a great reading for everyone!	2000-08-27

This is a gem of a novel by Conrad.The core of all is the relationship  between Jim feelings of guiltness and the reality surrounding him.Every  attempt to reach redemption by Jim is constantly frustated by his own  unforgiviness toward himself that in the end leads him to a noble but  senseless death.It seems that Conrad suggests to us that reaching  perfection is less important than learn to accept ourselves as we  are.Nature and society in Conrad vision are terrible forces totally  indifferent of individual feelings.What is left to man in this doomed  struggle is a kind of heroicity in going on the same.The novel is also  masterful in the use of a narrator voice which permits to assist to the  developement of the tale from an &quot;external&quot; but personal point of  view.The writing style of Conrad is very powerful and fascinating .5 stars  for this terrific novel!	2000-08-18

This is not a good book to study semiconductor devices.In the reality it  is a patchwork of uncorrelated articles about various devices lacking unity  of vision and clearness in the exposition.Very often it happened to me to  use other 2 or 3 other books only to understand Sze .And the author is  extremely fond of making reference to final formulas without explaining the  logical developement used.And now the book is dated too:so do not buy this  book,try instead &quot;Device eletronics for integrated circuits&quot; by  Muller and Kamins which is advanced and well conceived too!	2000-08-05

Do you want to read a book which is romantic ,but not frivolous,thrilling but not exagerated?Then try &quot;Helena&quot; written by Machado De Assis,in my opinion the best Brazilian writer of all times.But beware!The  author is very exact, almost cynical, in showing life as it really is,full  of lies and deceptions.So reading Machado books is always a very tough  exercise because you always fell to be personally examinated and confronted  by the author.But this &quot;interactivity&quot;,plus the inimitable  witness of Machado is what makes the reading a most pleasing experience.In  this book which which belongs to the &quot;Romantic&quot; period of Machado  De Assis production the author explores his favourite theme:the conflict  between what we really are and what we are supposed(by the other people of  course) to be.Who is really Helena?We all are Helena because basically we  all live in the same contraddiction that she in the end is unable to face  anymore.The other point in which Machado excelles is in the analysis of the  family life expecially the very special relationship which develops between  brother and sister.I suggest to  everyone to read this book of Machado and  many others.5stars!	2000-07-01

It is very difficult to review so superb a work but i will try:in short there are two basics things in the Divina Commedia that attract the reader:one is a very comprehensive descripition of medieval  society,history,religion and science made by a first class scholar like  Dante Alighieri,the other is a most penetrating and revealing analysis of  the &quot;ethernal&quot; human being with all the good and the bad everyone  of us experiences in his daily life.In the Commedia every aspect of life is  examined and accounted for.But i think that the real magic of Dante is the  almost super-natural ability to express his views in the most exquisitely  crafted verses of Italian literature.Try for example to read Dante and  Virgilio encounter with Ulysses or with Paolo and Francesca and you will be  almost lifted by the author powers of dramatic rendering of life to another  plane of existence and knoweldge.I adore Dante and hope everyone loves him  too!Best Italian book ever written!	2000-07-01

This book is a  good pratical introduction to control systems.It covers all the basic stuff like Bode and Nyquist diagrams,root locus and an introduction to state space design and analysis techniques.It is divided in modules which are (nearly) independent one from the other.The real strength  is the very large number of solved clear    exercises from which you can  gain a lot of hints.While not a complete theory book(for this use  &quot;State Space and Input-Output Linear Systems&quot; by Delchamps)it has  a nice intuitive theoretical approach to many subjects.Also good for the  beginning students are a lot of examples from basic mechanics and circuit  theory.On the whole a good and engaging text for the newcomer to the  control systems area.	2000-04-02
