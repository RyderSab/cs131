It is also not full of black and white pictures - i understand the artistic value of these type of pictures but egypt is full of colour!<br />all the sites are accompanied by well written descriptions and a brief history.  Again, i am always careful about what egyptology writes about ancient egypt since i still believe there is a lot of conjecture which tends to be presented as fact. for example: the symbolic nature of the temples seems to be covered well by the book but one should probably read such infor as logical hypothesis rather than reasonable fact -  it is rare that authors say the infor comes from an ancient papyrus!<br />all in all, it is indeed a complete guide to the temples of ancient egypt and worth collecting!	2002-12-28

(It is not because their statues or paintings do not exist.) people are fascinated about egypt not becasue of its 'recorded' history, but also by the faces and images behind this glorious history.<br />secondly, the pictures are really mediocre in terms of artistic layout.  i would have appreciated, at least, full page portraits. when i bought the book i thought it would be full of (good quality) pictures.  Another disappointing feature is that there are many pictures in black and white...ahhh!<br />the information on the pharaohs is sufficient for entry-level fans of ancient egypt. personally i do not rely much on what egyptology says because a lot seems to be conjecture and they  seldom say that.  one only needs to read at the many contradictions surrounding the pyramids of giza.<br />nevertheless, it is not that much of a bad buy if you are looking for a quick reference to all the pharaohs since it is probably the only one which attempts to do so. (in fact this book is as disappointing as the other book in the series like the complete tombs of ancient egypt.)	2002-12-25

After studying the antropology of this people, the NUBIANS, and the archeological evidence, I have came to the simple conclusion that the reinforcement of your correct conclusion, regarding the race of most of the ancient Egyptians, is to be found in the NUBIANS. <br />For after I personally went through some ancient litterature (Strabo, Herodotus, Manetho) it seems clear to me that the modern day Nubians provided the main stock of the the ancient Egyptians.

I would like to clarify something from my previous review written on  4 December 2000, so that nobody is misled by it. The reason why the evidence in Black Spark, White Fire tends to lean heavily on the Afrocentric side, is because PAST and some current conventional understanding and analysis of ancient Egypt, according to the book, has been subjected to negative racial attitutes, scholarly partiotism and double standards from predominantly mainstream Egyptology. Once you remove such double standards, racial bias, and scholarly patriotism, then the reader will realize that many arguments made by Afrocentrics can be backed by evidence and this makes their arguments worth taking seriously! A new encompassing Egyptology, as recommended by the author, is mostly needed! I do not mind giving the book another five star.	2000-12-07
US	51004345	RHD41EI4APXQ1	0761521631	375000596	Black Spark, White Fire: Did African Explorers Civilize Ancient Europe?	Books	5	31	43	N	N	well researched and very impartial	The book predominantly deals with mainly the role (in European civilization) and identity of ancient Egypt (Kemet). Few points to make: 1. The book does challenge a lot of conventions in history. I do not have a problem with conventions, as long as they can stand the test of logic and evidence. The book, shows that many of the conventions in history - did Egyptians civilize Europe, who were the Egyptians, etc - are based on (very) shacky grounds. As with most challenges to conventions, people are VERY resistant and quick to dismiss them as &quot;nonsense&quot;, while all that is need is an open mind approach. 2. It seems so very easy to counter many of the Egyptologists views, conventions and version of history. The book adduces a LOT of evidence in the form of ancient testimonies, aercheology, laborotary research, etc, to analyse BOTH sides of the arguments. Unfortunately and Fortunately, most of the evidence tends to lean on the favour of Afrocentrics and the reason why it is so, according to the book, is because of racial attitudes, scholarly partriotism and double standards infliltrating scholarly work. 3. The book, although classified as history, has most of the elements of a thriller. It suspends the reader becasue of its approach towards the issues (does not give answers from the onset and easy ones), which makes it one of the best readings I have had so far. 4. In all fairness, it is likely tol offend many people, especially those who may believe in racial superiority, now and since (against other races and within themselves as a race: eg the &quot;true Aryan&quot; attitude), yet it will also be most informative to many people out there seeking part reasons for the evolution of racism - it is not only about the identity of Egypt and their role in civilizing Europe). The book does call a spade-a-spade and supports this with hard and very difficult evidence to refute! 5. Some points, like the connection between Knights Templars, Freemansory and Egypt, have long been made by other writers (Hiram Key), while many points are fascinating. 6. The book left me with a better understanding of ancient Egypt, its role, and identity, simply because it is NOT written by a person of particular inclinations and stereotypes, but a neutral person! it is WELL WRITTEN.  Pitty many people will give it a one star becasue it is written in the era of dominant Afrocentric writing and may reveal things some people wouldn't like to be discussed in the &quot;open&quot;. Do not judge it by the number of stars, but by its content and arguments.	2000-12-04

Marxian Economics is generally presented as an early critique of classial economy, and a &quot;difficult&quot; one too. As to difficulty,  it is not that unconscionably incomprehensible! There are many apsects of  Marxian Economics that make a lot of sense (to me). True, Marx is most  likely to be appealing to workers and below subsistence income earners,  just as much as classical and neoclasscial economics  is most likely to  appeal to capital owners and free &quot;marketeers&quot;. Not to forget  Keynes who will garner support from those who prefer reasonable state  intervention! So every school of thought has its own target and appeal. In  this book, you will find basic concepts of  labour theory of value (what  determines the value of a commodity); monetary theory (the evolution of  money); the Theory of Surplus Value (what is profit and how does it come  about - to Marx, profit represents that portion of icome/value  &quot;improperly&quot; appropriated by capital owners instead of accruing  to workers. Since workers are the sole producers of  goods from scratch to  end, they should benefit from all income, or at least from most of it, as  per Marxian argument); and lastly, the mechanism of production. Trust me,  if you read Marxism with an open mind (and not with a bias attitude of it   being revolutionary, inefficient, dictatorial and a threat), you will  realize it has a very interesting, unique and relatively realistic method  of explaning inequality and exploitation generally!  Relative poverty does  not exist exclusively in poor or  so called &quot;third-world&quot;  countries, even in UK, for example, there are relatively poor people (who  for example cannot afford private schooling), despite its strong economy.   As much as Communism/Socilaism is history, the ideas are still alive and  very much interesting!  Read it to enhance your understanding of this  renowned work byKarl Marx!	2000-06-28

I personally still cannot understand how people can be confused as to the identity of many of the pharaohs: by simply looking at their statues, I see  blacks, even without  colour.  When I first analyzed the identity of the  ancient Kemets (Egyptians), I started by looking at their statutes and  busts, and I can see mostly black features in them. I am just being honest  with myself and everyone! In fact some of them look like my African  friends! Diop argues that the Egyptian civilization was initiated by a  Black race and sustained by it. This race, was probably from the land of  Kush, as he argues. He deals with everything, starting from the identity of  the mummies, the &quot;red&quot; complexion, the relationship of Egypt with  its neighbours, etc. And als,  if they were Black, what happened to them.  He does not only present his argument, but also deals with other people's  counterarguments, and trust me, there are so many unbelievable  self-contradictions in many of these so-called Egyptologists or historians  propositions/arguments: they argue that Egypt was anything but  black.  There are just certain things in life you cannot hide forever, especially  if they do not belong to you, and never belonged to you, and if they will  never belong to you!  Any objective book that corrects the injustices of  the past, especially African history, for me, deserves 5 stars.	2000-05-16

I am still wandering why it took such a long time for me to review this extraordinary gospel. This is one of the most easy to read and follow gospel within the Gnostic gospels,  and indeed amongst many of the gospels. The language is clear and the  gospel is well structured. Pistis is indeed a rare gospel: it tells of the  secret words that you must say for you to reach the highest God and Goddess  (not the God of creation); it informs you of the many gods and goddesses  that exist  and the levels of space they occupy. Mind you, all these is  said by Jesus himself, that is the Gnostic Jesus. Mary Magdala (Jesus'  partner)  is so intelligent  in her questions and answers, in fact Jesus  tells her that her spirit has been purified and therefore at its best (of  course hoping that this is a genuine praise and not based on partner  favouritism). But yes, Mary Magadala, beside the praises from her partner,  is quite outstanding. She even tells Jesus that she is scared of Peter  since St Peter hates the female race! Do not expect anything canonical or  convetional from this gospel. It is a very disturbing gospel, yet very  powerful indeed. It even explains the difficult parables: &quot;5 will be  in a house and 3 will rise against 2 and 2 against 3...&quot; It also  explains the parable of the coin - give to Caesar that which belongs to  him... This is one gospel, which I must concur, I also do not understand  why it has not received much attention as the other gospels!	2000-05-04

Sometimes you ask yourself about a book: is it the author who is so good OR the actual past events that are shocking! In &quot;The Holocaust&quot; you will find both.  This is a VERY DETAILED book on the fate of the Jews  during the second world war: the events as they unfolded, the dates of  extermination; the methods of killing; the marches; the ghettos; the  numbers massacred.<br />The author uses a lot of eyewitness accounts from all  sides, and provides excellent facts. The book is MOST UNBIAS: it deals also  with the early retaliations by Jews which intesified the already exisiting  autrocities (against Jews) that were to follow!<br />For me: it was the first  time I came &quot;face to face&quot; with the detailed HORRORS and  AUTROCITIES of the holocaust! The book is most depressing because it  relates one of the most evil periods of humankind when indeed the forces of  evil truimphed over matter. I have learned a lot from this book: as much as  we are different in many aspects, we are all humans, and mostly, we possess  that survival SPIRIT which is as hard as iron - this is the spirit that  kept the Jews going.

Get the book,  even if it does not answer the BIG  question: who then is the true genuine  Semetic Jew? Also, Koestler calls the Falasha of  Ethiopia, &quot;the  Falasha of Abyssinia&quot;.

Eve was the first human to be created so that she can illuminate Adam from his ignorance. The ignorance is that Adam contains a spirit that does not  belong on earth but is simply trapped in the body. It is this spirit, this  light, that belongs to the highest supreme. 2. the other gospel says that  is was Adam that was created first, nevertheless, Eve was the one who  illuminated the poor, sleeping, incompetent Adam. 3. That there are 2 Gods  in the universe. The one who is supposed to have created the earth and man  is Samael (the god of darkness and of ignorance), who later proclaims  himself the only God. Then there is the other God, the God of truth, the  highest God, the androgynous father, the light, the God of goodness. 4.  Human beings are gods that contain the great light or spirit of the highest  androgynous father. The sad part, is that this holy spirit is trapped in  the material world, viz. the body, flesh or matter. You do not need a  church father to invoke this goodness in you. 5. To gain salvation,  according to the Gnostics, all you need is to know the above truth,  knowledge (gnosis), that there is a higher God whom all of us are from and  must return to. This high  bright spirit is in all of us, but clouded by  the material things of the world, including the body. I LOVE GNOSTICISM. IT  GIVES ME ANSWERS TO MANY QUESTIONS THAT CANNOT BE READILY ANSWERED: why is  'God' so destructive and cruel, especially in the old testament - even in  the modern world (holocaust, earthquakes, etc.) I LOVE ALSO ITS FEMININE  ELEMENTS! It is most adviced that one should seek an introductory book on  Gnosticism before attempting the Nag Hammadi Library itself. I suggest one  of them, viz. &quot;the elements of Gnosticism&quot; by Stuart Holroyd.	1999-11-23
US	51004345	RTA8VJQOSDVWE	1881316033	862606408	History of the First Council of Nice: A World's Christian Convention A.D. 325 With a Life of Constantine	Books	3	32	42	N	N	A bit dissapointing	The book goes into good and interesting details on the life of Constantine and to a greater extant on the history of the council of nice which made christianity a formal institution. I was VERY dissapointed when the book  FAILED to deal in detail with the books/canons that were LEFT OUT (LOST) of  the conventional bible. The book only lists those books/canons that were  included, BUT fails to inform the reader as to those canons/books that were  omitted (lost) or excluded from the conventional books adopted at the  council. To be honest I baught the book for this (excluded/lost canons)  part! Yet the book does well to inform the reader as to the main issue that  was brought to the council, viz. the divinity of Jesus the Messiah  (Christ). It also informs the reader of some of the agreements reached by  the council regarding the church and its formalized religion: especially  that Sunday was decided solely  by Constatine to be our Sabbath, while the  proper rest day is supposed to be Suturday..	1999-11-23

Series)	Books	5	16	18	N	N	I Love Gnosticism	I will love this book and its content for so long as I am on earth: of course until something dramatic to the contrary emerges. The book is a good intorduction into Gnosticism. It gives you the various interpretations of   Genesis within the Gnosticism approach: there are two different and  opposing Gods in the universe. Gnosticism gives me answers to questions   that I have always pondered on: why does &quot;God&quot; (the God of  wind/storm) behave so cruelly sometimes (especially in the Old Testament),  may be even today. It provides various Gnostic schools of thought . Very  simple and illuminating. Although it does not dwell deeply into the  subjects, it does provide you with a good basic understanding of  Gnosticism. Read together with &quot;The Nag Hammadi Library in  English&quot; (the bible for the Gnostics), it will really blow your mind.   Of course, it is not for orthodox conventional Christians, yet they may  benefit from it, if they are willing of course!	1999-11-23

Any objecive, unbiased and well argued book on African civilizations or history deserves a 5 star for me: the reason being simple, there are not many of such books in the world! Ms Monges has presented both sides of the argument (an art of arguing) and has logically and objectively rejoindered  some of the eurocentric views and arguments very well. I have read 3 other  books on Africa and Kemet (Egypt) and all share to a great extent the same  well argued, objective and afrocentric view as potrayed by Ms Monges. I  have always asked myself what do european anthropologists or so-called  egyptologists mean by: 'negroid', but not 'negro'; to rephrase, black but  not black enough? Indeed I have found several of the their arguments very  irrational, absurd and illogical. Indeed Ms Monges does well to deal with  most of the misconceptions surrounding Kemet, Kush and Africa. She seeks  partly to adduce evidence for the Blackness of Egypt by comparing it to  other cultural practices in modern Africa. Something which she does very  well! Jesus said: there is nothing that is hidden that will not be  revealed. Thank You Ms Monges for you objective Afrocentricity!	1999-11-07
US	51004345	R2THMTC6YQ1P9Q	080650420X	799260893	Introduction to African Civilizations	Books	5	45	48	N	N	MARVELOUS	To be honest: to me any objective, well argued and unbiased book on the history of Africa and its civilizations deserves a 5 star rating. The distortion of African history especially by Europeans  has been exposed by  many objective and unbiased researchers. Indeed, the honourable Mr Jackson  is one of those distinguished objective and unbiased authors of African  history. This book is not simply about Black ego boosting - it  is simply  about setting the facts straight, presenting excellent arguments, and  adducing convincing evidence in the form of references and archeological  finds: he presents both the objective and the impartial sides, and argues  so excellently against the distortion. From its introduction, the pre  history up to the current state of Africa, the book is simply a marvel.  Most impressed was I by the massive and shocking quotations.	1999-11-05

If you were to concentrate too much on the details, you are  mostly likely to even get confused. I appreciated the use of the true  original ancient Egptian words rather than their Greek counterparts: e.g  Ausar for Osiris.  Using only Greek words in texts tends to send a  misleading message that the ancient Egyptians were Greek or Europeans:  given the uncessary ongoing dispute as to their racial identity. I enjoyed  the part on the Egyptian model explaining the ancient Egyptian religion,  especially the ancesstral part: something which even today I feel many  people, especially  Christians, have terribly misunderstood: the ancesstors  did not replace God in the so-called pagan system, they (ancesstors) were  simply middlemen between those still alive and God.  Also, the appreciation  and respect of nature (paganism) is simply respecting and appreciating  God's power of creation. The author does extremely WELL to explain these  simple concepts. This religion part only, for me, deserves a 5 star rating.  His conclusion was most approapriate and relevant as I still believe there  is no misfortune that willl last forever.	1999-11-05

Indeed the book will appeal to all races  and is most relevant to all races: it attempts to expalin the  origin of  various races and religions that exist today and their effect on  the world today. I have always suspected that the reason(s) for the  persistent hardship(s) faced by Blacks all over the world has to do with  something we did in the past. Indeed the author does raise this issue and  gives excellent responses to it.	1999-10-16

It does away with the conventional and  difficult language of the conventional bible. For the first time that I was able to  read the bible's gospels with such  interest, passion and ease. I would even appreciate it if the old testament  would be retranslated to accomodate the simple and exciting language  adopted by &quot;The Complete Gospels&quot;. The content itslef is  obviously most interesting.	1999-10-07

Through this book, for the first time,  I came accross the so-called Gnostic Gospels which offer a very interesting  alternative to conventional Christianity. I was also most impressed by the  research undertaken by the writers, needless to mention the interesting  topics covered. An enlightening document indeed: preferably to freethinkers  rather than convetional christians who may find most of its contents absurd  if not offending. Yet all in all, a masterpiece when it comes to analysing  chritianity GENERALLY and OBJECTIVELY!	1999-10-07
