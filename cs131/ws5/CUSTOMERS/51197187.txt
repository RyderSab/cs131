They kill their prey when they feed, so for me they have no redeeming graces no matter how polite, handsome, sexy, etc that they are.  I really did not want to read more than the first few pages, but since I spent so much money on this very short novella, I thought I could probably stand to finish it.  I found the writing less than spectacular also.  The descriptions and scenes seemed to be written in an amateur fashion, so I could not think of the characters as \\"real.\\"  The two main characters fell in love so quickly that I had to read the page again to be sure I had gotten it correct.  Nia was ready for Seth to make a move on her before he even came in the door.  Others may like this sort of approach, but I need some buildup for the relationship to ring true.  While I did like the mixed race content, the rest of it left me cold.  Killer vampires are just not my cup of tea and I could care less if they meet their mates and live happily ever after.  Just think of how many people over the centuries had their lives cut short so that these vampires could continue their existence. Even Nia's friend Imani is killed in the first three pages of the story.  What more can I say.	2005-10-14

A chuckle here and there is all I could manage. The stories have very \\"light\\" romance almost no sex, which I can't fault any writer for leaving out if that is her style.  However, something else has to work and nothing worked for me.  The characters were completely forgettable, which is why I have not gone into any details. Just thinking about them makes me want to kick myself for buying this book. Save your money.  For over $10 it is much too expensive for a rehash of stories that lack any meaningful content, excitement or romance. A touch of humor is all that keeps me from giving this 1 star.	2005-10-13

I love Sherrilyn Kenyon and just never thought that I would purchase a book that I already read 2 out of the 3 stories.  Out of respect for devoted readers, the author should warn us of repeat performances. I'm not going to review any of the stories because others have already done so.  I'll just say that they were not great the first time around and certainly not worth paying again to read. I'll stick to Ms Kenyon's Dark-Hunter series and forget her BAD stories which are in fact pretty bad. <br /> <br />	2005-10-04

While the first two stand on their own, this one would benefit from the previous information in the other two.  In fact, you will be slightly confused towards the end if you have not read the previous books.  That said, this is a great read, despite some  moralizing on the writer's part and her obvious objection to cloning and DNA manipulation.  The love story is hot, the idea behind the landing of 9 alien women on US soil intriquing and very well thought out.  I could not imagine how Mira and Lucas were going to get out of their situation and wind up together, but I said the writing was cleaver and so is the ending.  I thought this was going to be a nine-part series but I am almost certain this is the last book.  I give Judi McCoy a lot of credit for knowing when and how to stop.  You are going to love the entire series.  It's hot and sexy and captures your interest throughout.  I did not want to put it down and did not want it to end.  You'll want to read this series again and again. Think about the media circus and public frenzy that any unfortunate alien would actually experience should he or she find themselves on earth.  I just love fiction and happy endings.	2005-09-13

But my main comlaint is with the vampire and the heroine who I did not like or enjoy reading about. He was too cavalier, distant, uptight and she was too annoying with her prudish, bookish, rather stilted attitude.  I also disliked the tedious descriptions that went on and on.  I really had trouble finishing this book, because none of the characters rang true or even fantastic, either would have worked for me.  By the style of the cover you might think this book is humorous, but alas that angle doesn't work either.  Some might find the characters funny, but I just found them ridiculous.  Any humor was tasteless and at the expense of the characters.  I could have cared less if Emily and Val got together.  They seemed so disconnected and distant and their passions so weak and dimwitted, no pun intended.	2005-09-09

The characters were shallow and unpleasant.  I could not stand Louise who claimed to dislike being pursued for her beauty, but could not think of anything other than how beautiful she was and how she deserved a handsome man for a husband.  How could anyone justify an affair on board ship with a stranger by a woman (or more correctly a teenager) on her way to meet the man she will marry and how can her future husband who is posing as her mysterious lover ever forgive her for having this affair even though he is the man she is having sex with?  Louise never really loves the man she married and can never really get beyond his flaws.  The ending makes no sense.  Suddenly Louise accepts Charles and his less than perfect face, claims to love him even though he has been deceiving her, is pregnant with her lover's child who is actually her husband's child because he is her secret lover. Yuck!! If I could give this zero stars I would.  I only finished it because I purchased it hoping that the beauty wasn't shallow and the beast wasn't stupid - silly me.	2005-08-05

One fight after another, problem after problem easily solved, dead coming back to life because good triumphs over evil and on and on.  I don't care what any other reviewer says, for me I could have skipped the middle, except for the sex which was hot, and gone to the epilogue without missing a beat.	2005-07-17

Not only do we learn a lot more about Ash but the entire dark hunter story is moved forward into a new realm of understanding.  To top it off the love story between Danger and Alexion was very different, unusual and took an unexpected, exciting turn.  Simi's story is also given more information and the last section of the book puts it all into perspective, so be sure to read this chapter first - it's called The Beginning - if you haven't already read it on Kenyon's website. As usual with the dark-hunter series, I laughed, cried and enjoyed.  By the way the love scenes were terrific, so don't listen to the negatives about that either.  Read the book and see for yourself.  I don't think you'll be sorry, provided you are familiar with the rest of the series.  This book does not really stand on its own.  You miss a great deal if you are not aware of what has gone before in the dark-hunter saga.	2005-07-04

Did no one notice that the last and longest story by Camille Anthony was left unfinished?  Who wants to read a short story that requires you to read another book to prepare you for the events in the story, a dictionary to understand it and another book to find out what happens.  Not to mention that these are all repeats and can be found in ebooks.  I'd like to know before I spend more than $10 whether the stories are fresh or not and whether they are complete in themselves. The first two stories were enjoyable enough but so short that I would never have purchased this book if I had known about the last one.  Do yourself a favor and save enough for a nice lunch and borrow this from someone stupid enough to buy it.  Come to think of it you can have mine!!!	2005-07-01

While I agree there was a lot of arguing and sex (did I say great sex?), I also thought the story line was terrific. I could not put this down and was not disappointed. Margot and Davy were made for each other, both strong and tough, but never lacking in emotion. I can't wait for Sean's story.  It would be nice to read the first two books before this one, but it is not necessary.  This book stands on its own.  I would, however, read them all because they are full of drama, love, sex, mystery, character - the things that make a great story. Keep them coming Ms. McKenna and I'll keep reading them.	2005-06-14

I could not stand Kat, did not get much insight into Lance or any other character for that matter.  I was so bored or annoyed with the plot that I skipped through the last half to the end which some might find cleavor but I found to be another annoying element of the plot that leaves the reader without any resolution so the whole story becomes a big unfunny joke. I expected this to be a humorous time travel love story. My mistake, it was just a ridiculous farse on the Camelot tale.	2005-06-09

I can only say DITTO to the other reviewers' comments and that Lori Foster never disappoints.  This book was well worth the wait. A great ending to a great series that returns all the characters we have come to know and love.  I read this in one sitting, could not put it down and cried when it was over and am crying now as I write this review.  Silly me, but I'll miss every one of these characters.

Perhaps it is just that this type of book is not to my taste.  I was expecting a vampire novel with an erotic element and an exciting plot.  Well the vampire part is correct, but the rest was not there for me unless torture and impotence are erotic.  It took more than three quarters of the book for the vampire and his mate to find mutual satisfaction in a less than erotic manner.  The book was suppose to be a page turner, but for me the only page turning I did was to skip parts that were so boring and detailed that I could barely keep my attention focused on the plot.  Clearly I am in the minority and most of the people who read Ms Squires' novels know and appreciate her writing style.  This is my first attempt at reading one of her books and it will be may last.  If you are looking for an erotic love story vampire style, \\"The Companion\\" is not for you.	2005-05-20

Her main characters are alive, believable, sensitive, strong and made for each other.  Their trials and tribulations, secrets and revelations are drawn out through the story adding excitement tension and anticipation.  I never once questioned any part of the plot and always felt compassion for the Sim and Tally.  I was also never disappointed in the twists and turns, because these two had to forgive themselves before they could accept love.  I couldn't wait for the ending and hated to finish the story and that's what makes Ms. Krinard's novels so great and as usual I was not disappointed.	2005-05-13

I'm so disappointed in this book that I can hardly write a review.  It is completely useless as part of a series, goes nowhere, spans only one day, is confusing and the sex isn't all that good. So much of the sex is magic, dreamlike, unreal and I'm not sure what is imaginary and what is actually suppose to be happening.  In fact, nothing actually happens in this book.  It is like a chapter in a long novel that takes you nowhere and you don't learn anymore than you knew the chapter before.  There is enough horror to put this book in the category that Hamilton seems to aspire, but there isn't enough plot to make a book out of the story.  I don't even care if Merry ever gets pregnant and I'm getting tired of the annoying idiosyncracies of each guard and the powers and magic that develop through sex, if anyone can figure out what they are.  I'm not even sure that you can call what Merry does with these men sex, since right after each session she winds up somewhere else surrounded by any number of guards whose names are not always known.  The problem with this series is that Hamilton's fans still buy her books, so there is no need for her to change her strategy no matter how much we complain.  The proof is in the purchases, which I'm sure will put this awful excuse for a novel in the best selling category.  I'm going to try to take my own advice and not purchase another book in this series.  If I must read it, I will just have to wait until it is available at my local library.  At least then I won't have to look at it on my bookshelf and remember how I was cheated.	2005-05-01

The type could have been half the size and the story twice the length and it still would not have worked.  When Ms. Sizemore decided that Colin would be a Prime Vampire who was just 36 years old, she set the story up for failure.  Just think about it.  If you were in his situation knowing that you could live for five hundred years, would you want to find your bond mate at 36?  How could anyone not understand Colin's reaction to Mia.  He is young, has his expectations for what he wants in a mate, and is not at all ready to change or accept what fate has decided for him. He hasn't even lived long enough to experience the angst that older Prime vampires feel when they are searching for, and not able to find, their bond mate.  No wonder Colin is always trying to ditch Mia.  Mia on the other hand is a, I don't know exactly how old, virgin.  Where has she been, living under a rock waiting for Colin, who is so young he doesn't even realize that Mia's virginity is still intact or experience the pleasure of being her first?  How sad is that for a story line.  The only good part of this book, and the reason I gave it three stars, is Laurent.  There is  great potential in his story. I assume he is supposed to be tribe, yet something is not quite right about his lineage.  Tribe vampires are montsters hunted and destroyed by clan vampires and mortal hunters, so what is different about Laurent? We can only hope that Ms. Sizemore uses this great idea to its full potential.  By the way Laurent is the reason you want to buy and read this book if you are hooked on this series.	2005-04-05

A Vampire story that is listed as a romance should include both action and romance.  Well the first is not very exciting and the second is completely non-existent - a kiss, a touch perhaps, but don't expect anything else in the way of love play.  The stories were so boring that I skipped around till I found something interesting.  They all had great potential and since they were linked even more could have been done with that theme.  I was very disappointed and will not purchase any others in these series until I'm sure the content will satisfy what I expect to find in a vampire romance novel.	2005-03-02

It made me laugh out loud as well as shed a few tears.  Cindy was a terrific, funny and sensitive heroine and Thrain was luscious and very likeable.  I enjoyed seeing characters from previous books.  Ganemede, Sparkle, Darach, Blythe.  What a great idea to use Cosmic Troublemakers to move the story along and the vampire adventures are also great. Each character had a wicked sense of humor and great sex appeal.  The sex scenes were HOT and fun!!! You might enjoy this book even more if you read Darach's story first in Master of Ecstasy.  Then you will know all about Thrain, why he is looking for Cindy and what happened to him and Darach that almost destroyed them.  The role Ganemede and Sparkle played in that book will help you understand them better and what their goals are. Ms. Bangs goes to great lengths to bring the reader up to date in this book and assumes you have not read the previous one, but it is so much more fun to read it all in story form. Buy both books.

I have read all of Ms. Feehan's Dark series and I must agree with the negative comments made by others on Dark Secret.  I did not like Rafael nor did I think he was in love with his lifemate.  He was completely selfish, did not consider her feelings at all and raped her beyond a doubt.  Rafael rushed into the relationship and looked at Colby as his own personal property.  I had a very hard time getting through this book and I must agree that Rafael is the most heartless of all the Carpathians in the Dark series and did not redeem himself anywhere in this story.  I hope his brother Nicholas does not react in the same way when his lifemate comes along.   I miss caring about the Carpathian hero and rooting for his success in converting his mate and the mutual love that eventually develops between the two.  Please Ms. Feehan, do not write anything like this again.  As you can see it is hard for your readers and detrimental to the series. I wonder if anyone noticed the introduction of a future lifemate in this book.  Dare I hope her story is not going to be on the same path as Dark Secret.	2005-02-21

It is a murder mystery, time travel, love story and the end of a series. It was sexy, dramatic and spellbinding.  The only problem I had was the short epilogue on Esme Sparrow whose destiny makes the other stories happen.  I would have loved to have a sixth book about Esme.  The loss of this important link is impossible to rectify without telling her complete story. I gave this four stars not for the story itself, but for the way the series ended.  What a missed opportunity.	2005-01-31

While I loved the first three in this five-part series, this one left me cold. Since it is so far along in the series one would hope that the previous characters would be reintroduced and play some role in this plot. Because they are nowhere to be found in this story, it is hard to tell when in the scheme of the plotlines this particlar event is taking place.  I must assume Laura Hayden wrote this book before the others were written, so it is not connected to the rest of the series.  Otherwise, I found it hard to like Delgatto and Emily or root for their romance.  The humor seemed out of place, not very funny and I found it tedius to read.  I might have skipped around if I had known it was not connecting the other characters in previous books, but I was afraid I would miss something that might be relevant to the  eventual outcome of the series.	2005-01-28

I, however, could not get beyond the fact that the hero was an assassin, a member of the Mafia (Family), liked his job and did not hesitate to kill for money.  I'm not saying that he got a thrill out of killing, not at all, but nevertheless this was the job he chose to do.  I do not buy the fact that the victims deserved to be killed, or that he took jobs of that type deliberately. I also don't think this deserves a sequel if the characters are to remain the hero and heroine.  Then it would no longer be a romance, but a mystery or horror story.  The ending was complete in itself and did not hint at a followup. By the way I did not like the smell thing or the mind reading, it just overtook the story or became the story.  The book was almost totally one character, the hero and the teller of the story.  I barely know what the heroine's true personality, feelings, etc. or how she justified her relationship with her family and with the hero.  Weakness is the only thing that comes to mind and I don't think that was the authors' intention.  Since most of the other readers enjoyed the book, I feel that it must be a matter of taste and this story left a bad taste in my mouth.	2005-01-06

But I have to warn those not familiar with these authors that if you have not read the previous related novels - Hamilton's Anita Blake series, Harris's Sookie Stackhouse vampire novels, Knight's - Knights of the Roundtable series - you are not going to truly understand what is going on.  Since I have read them all it is difficult for me to know whether they could possbily stand on their own, but I think not.  Hamilton's story was much too short to even be included as part of the anthology and it added nothing to the series.  I feel Harris's story was similar in that it didn't add much to Sookie Stackhouse's adventures.  On the other hand Knight's Galahad was a new adventure in her Round Table series that I liked very much and the Taylor story was new to me and worked quite well.  I don't think it was part of a series, but if it was it certainly stood on its own.  I recommend this anthology especially to those readers who know the authors' series.  Even those stories that don't add much contain the characters we know and love, so are therefore still fun reads.	2005-01-02

I could not put this book down, but neither could I put the other two in the series down when I read them.  Ms. Hendricks is a very talented writer and her stories are more than just fun reads.  They are deep without being clawing and have a moral without being preachy. You might enjoy this book more if you read Gemini Moon and Crystal Moon first, but it is not absolutely necessary.  This story stands on its own, but I always enjoy seeing characters from previous books return even for a short time.  I wonder if there will be more to this series.

I thought Chance was a terrific hero and Sonny his perfect match.  She did not quickly forgive him and he was not mean to her.  He had a terrorist to catch and he protected her as best he could in the process.  What else would those readers have had him do, give it all up and take Sonny away while her father still lived and threatened her and the rest of the world? <br />Not a \\"Chance.\\"  The ending was anything but abrupt.  It was just the exact type of ending that the series reader could want.  It expressed Chance's love for his adopted family and his acceptance of his position in it.  Ms. Howard knows her characters and knows how to write a story.  Although I am sorry to see this series end I fully understand that it cannot go on without the death of Wolf and Mary and that would not be worth its continuation.

US	51197187	R2ALY6P339KGXB	0505525194	686361693	Dream Of Me	Books	1	4	9	N	Y	What a Downer!!!	While I loved the first episode of this tale, Come to Me, I did not enjoy this one at all. I would have given it zero stars for the ending alone. It took more than 200 pages to get beyond the annoying, whining naievity of the heroine, Lucia, who was so innocent about life that it got to be very tedius putting up with her fears and complete misunderstanding of the simplest aspects of sex. Just when I thought the ending would redeem the rest of the book Ms. Cach left the reader with a doozy of a cliffhanger that ruined any positive thoughts about the hero, Theron and what he did so he could wed Lucia.  I hope very much that this is the last book in this series, but I am afraid that Ms. Cach will probably continue to pursue this storyline to its bitter conclusion.  Anyway, I will not be reading anything else by this author. If you read the first book in this series you might venture into this second one, but be forewarned it has no redeeming graces and a positively awful premise for an ending. Some, however, may view it as very cleaver.  I am not among those readers.	2004-11-15

I am a fan of Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter series so I would never have missed the were-panther story in this book.  I agree it was too short and the characters not fleshed out but I still liked it and am glad I read it.  Even this short story gave me more information about were-panthers and a little more insight into Acheron.  If you haven't read the rest of the series you are not going to get as much out of it, but you should still  enjoy the story.<br /><br />I have read a lot of Amanda Ashley's work and this, of course, was not her best.  A little trite but still I enjoyed reading it.<br /><br />L. A. Banks was not my cup of tea and I would have liked to give this one zero stars.  I did not understand it, did not like it and found it quite depressing.  Even after some of the reviews explained her seers and guardians I still didn't understand it nor could anything make me like this story.  HATE is a more accurate description of how I felt about it and I should have listened to other reviewers and just not read this one.  My advice is skip it.<br /><br />Lori Handland wrote the best story even considering how much I loved reading Kenyon's Winter Born.  This one had humor that made it an extremely enjoyable read.  I loved Maya and even though I normally would not have liked the first person narrative, I began to really prefer it in this instance.  I quickly appreciated Handland's decision to write it that way.  A winning story that made me want to read more of this author.	2004-11-12

But I am having trouble coming to terms with the Knights of the Round Table theme along with Lancelot, King Arthur and Merlin among others from that tale. I know most reviewers really like the way Ms. Knight wove that story into her new interpretation, but I found it distracting.  Perhaps this will bother me less as the series progresses. Angela Knight is a very good writer who does sex scenes that sizzle and has a unique approach to her subject. You can get lost in all the different characters, but Ms. Knight knows how to write them into her story without causing any confusion for the reader, while setting up characters for future books in this series. Just so you know the first story was about Lancelot and it appeared in the anthology called Hot Blooded.	2004-10-21

I have to admit I love short stories but sometimes I wish the authors could develop the characters better.  Well these authors do just that.  Each story is different with a twist that makes you keep reading and characters to fall in love with.  I am not going to discuss these stories because I am sure some other reviewers will spoil them for you, but at least I'll know it wasn't me.  Just remember I told you the stories are great, the romance wonderful, the sex terrific and the mysteries intriguing. When you finish the book you won't be able to stop thinking about what you just read.	2004-10-17

I love them all.  This one is just terrific.  It grabbed me from page one and never let me go.  Most romances take time to develop - not this one which just heats up and keeps getting hotter.  My favorite characters returned to help and of course the next book will be on Jamie Creed no question in my mind.  After that I hope we get one on Alyx and Scott.  What a fun read all in one night.

First let me say that I love books with lots of sex.  However, the sex in this book is so mechanical, so without any emotion, and so repetitive with endlessly boring screams and groans.  What's worse most sex scenes end with some disaster or dramatic turn that spoils the relationship between the participants.  Anita is so reluctant and then so willing that I wanted to kick her.  The plot seemed promising when you think that the sex was suppose to lead to greater powers, but instead we have another triumverate to worry about and vampires that have become wimps who exist only to do Anita's bidding.  Where is the strong. sexy Jean Claude that I came to love and Anita came to depend on for strength? Where was Asher?  He seemed to be asleep (or shall I say dead) for the entire book.  Characters appeared only for the purpose of having sex with Anita and then went somewhere outside the book only to reappear when she needed more sex - all in the short span of 48 hours.  The murder plot took up so few pages that I wasn't even sure it was meant to be an important plot line.  Anita is developing new powers, but there was so much metaphysical trash and so much gratuitous sex that I couldn't even follow the \\"new powers\\" line.  All I gleaned from this rather poor excuse for a book is that Anita was becoming stronger and everyone around her was there for the sole purpose of satisfying her needs and answering her call.  I have read all the Anita Blake novels even though I sensed from the last two that the plot was headed in this direction.  I kept hoping LKH would find her way back to the action that made this series so great.  Don't get me wrong, I'd hate to see the sex go, but surely it can be handled in a better way that moved the story along and made the scenes more enjoyable. I don't care if Anita \\"loves\\" more than one person, but I'd like to see the sex scenes express that love or at least be meaningful to the participants.  If LKH wants sex to be an important part of the series then make it, at least occasionally, a pleasant experience for the reader and the characters. I'll only read the next book in this series if I can get it from my library.  Then I won't feel so bad if I don't finish it.	2004-10-10

This book is so poorly written that I thought it was a writing project for a high school class.  The characters' thoughts are silly one liners without any depth.  Their feelings for each other are shallow and the heroine's excuse for remaining aloof from the hero is trite.  The story contains the usual fare rehashed into a silly romance without any connection between the characters and a limited story line.  I could live with anything if the writing style were not so amateurish and the plot had more depth and the lovers actually connected in a believable manner.  Eleanora's Ghost is just a means of moving the story along, but you never really believe in her possible existence and never feel her emotions.  I'm not sure what else this author has written, but I for one will stay away from any of her romance novels.	2004-10-04

The only trouble was that I had to skim three quarters of it to get to the part I liked.  The beginning was repetitive, almost boring once you realized the general plot and overly long before the hero and heroine got together.  I wish the reason Grace was set on this adventure did not involve such a heartbreaking tragedy.  It was difficult for me to get beyond that part of the story and to understand Grace's quick attraction to Niall. While I realized Niall's devotion to his cause, it was also difficult to understand why he left Grace without a backward glance.  Despite all these objections, I loved the last part of the book and wish it had been longer and the beginning much shorter.	2004-09-26

In fact I liked Rebecca York's story so much that I read the last ten pages many times over again.  It contained a new approach to who is the strong partner in a paranormal relationship and a very surprising contemporary twist to solving their problems.  I did not like Midnight Court.  It was different but in a confusing way.  I could hardly keep up with the dialogue and found myself reading sentences and paragraphs over again because I didn't get their meaning.  I'm still not sure what to make of the story or what relationship the hero and heroine had and will have in their future.  I just felt like I was reading a type of prose that required too much thought and thus did not allow for enjoyment of the story.  As you can see, others do not agree with my assessment and perhaps it is just a matter of taste.	2004-09-07

Adam Black is fabulous and Gabby is a perfect match for him.  I loved seeing Dageus and Dirsten and their mates again, but the greatest part of the story was Adam's devotion to Gabby and his willingness to sacrifice everything for her.  The Epilogue was a perfect ending to a great love story.  I hope there is more to this series, but I can't imagine topping this one.	2004-08-15

But if you are a fan of this series, you will love what you learn about the Were-Hunters and other shapeshifters, more about Ash and you get a chance to see some past characters and some new characters that are being primed for future stories. I have one question.  What if Vane's parents decide to work things out? Hasn't anyone considered what Vane's mother has done to his father to make sure any future relationship is impossible?  Talk about a living hell for the two of them no matter what the outcome.	2004-08-09

They have humor, they're sexy and great romance. The only thing I did not like about this book was how very naive Stephanie was and it was pretty ridiculous that she and Eric were afraid to say &quot;I love you.&quot; Good grief they were all over each other, what do three little words mean when it should have been obvious how they both felt. But it was the heroine's actions that were really hard to take. How could anyone living in the 21st century be so unaware of what men and women do in bed. These flaws gave the book 3 stars otherwise I would have given it 5. <br />  <br />	2004-08-06

It told you everything except what you really wanted to know.  Did Lisa have a baby?  If so why isn't it mentioned? Moning should have had an epilogue.  Instead she left us wondering if we read the story correctly or just imagined that Lisa was pregnant.  And give me break - changing the past to make everything right doesn't happen even in fiction.  What did Lisa's parents think of old Scotland - did they attend the wedding?  Were they suprised that their daughter had gone back in time to find her mate?  If Lisa doesn't remember what happened while she was away, then who was waking up in her bed during that time?  I realize that trying to make logical sense out of fiction is useless, but there should be some boundaries.  This book had none.  Having said that if you are reading this series do not miss this book, otherwise you will lose an important part of Adam Black.  And please do not begin by reading this book.  This series should be read in order for full enjoyment.	2004-07-28

Nicholae and Destiny did not have the fire and passion of the other lifemates.  Adding to this problem were the causes that Feehan took up in this book - battered women, abused children, sexual harrassment.  I do not read romantic vampire novels for their reality.  Fiction should remain fiction and not be used to support causes.  I'm surprised that Feehan has taken this turn in her books and hope she does not continue along these lines.  There is no magic, no excitement, nothing new to capture your interest or create concern for the characters. I could have cared less if these lifemates survived and that is a sad commentary on what has been a great series. Even bringing Gregori and Savannah back did not help the story. In fact I had to force myself to finish the book which continued to be less than captivating up to its dull ending. I hope that future books in this series are more like the first few and that characters and situations stick to vampire/carpathian fiction and not try to draw real life events or traumas into the story.	2004-07-24

I liked the unexpected twist the story takes towards the end, because it doesn't progress as the reader expects. You will love Bruce and root for Cyn and remember them long after the last page is read.  And oh boy are we in for more stories in this series: Julie, Scott and Jamie are sure to fill the pages of the next several books. I love that Lori brings characters from the previous stories back so that we continue to be part of their lives.  I can't wait until Lori tackles Jamie's story but on the way the others should be great.  As with all her series, I will certainly miss the characters when the final book is written.	2004-07-09

You have to get beyond Adrienne's annoying and nasty character and the problem of why Hawk loves her almost at first sight even though he has bedded many more beautiful women.  Adrienne was so mean to Hawk that I was hoping the poison or the arrow would actually kill her.  Aside from that the last few chapters were great and the love making when it occurred near the end was also terrific.  If you like the Highlander series, you should read this, but I would not recommend it as a first read in the series or you might not want to continue.	2004-06-27

It was obvious he loved her and any &quot;meanness&quot; was due to his need to have her. I liked this story and all its characters very much.  The mystery was also great and I must say I didn't guess who the villian was.  The story held me spellbound and the mystery unfolded evenly throughout the text.  The love scenes were terrific and there were just enough to enjoy without overpowering the story and the mystery.  Give this book a try.  I think it should appeal to both mystery and romance lovers.  I gave it four stars instead of five because I thought there were parts that were overly drawn out and I skimmed a few areas, but it was well worth read.	2004-06-20

It captures your interest from the first page and never lets you down. Granted some events were obvious and of course we knew Marc and Jo would be captured, but how they got away was worth the read. I also agree it took a long time for Josephine to realize Marcus was a vampire, but that's not an easy concept to grasp. How long would it take you? This was a true love story and I loved every minute of reading it and look forward to the next book in this series. I even enjoyed reading the previous book to remind myself where the hero fits in the series.  Read I Burn For You and then read this one - you will be in for a real enjoyable journey into Susan Sizemore's original vampire world.	2004-06-06

Why is it that females do not recognize their heartmates but male do?  Why do the passages not connect with heartmates?  If Ms. Owens is going to make a planet with certain rules, I think they should be followed.  This constant struggle between heartmates seems pointless and very sexist.  It is unfair that the female is not connected and must be forced and cannot be told she has a heartmate without the male facing a penalty for revealing what should be welcomed. Does this planet not want heartmates to connect?  Sometimes I feel that Ms. Owens has made such complicated rules for her planet that she can't even follow them or remember what they are.  I liked the first two from this series much better than this one and absolutely hated the ending.  The Holm Holly I came to love in the first two stories never appeared in this one.  I gave this two stars even though I like the futuristic world that has been created but in the end was very disappointed in the Romeo and Juliet plot, the violence and death and the unbearable loss that Holm Holly had to endure.	2004-06-03

The only saving grace to this book is its spotty humor and the heroine Rose.  I was hoping that Declan would mellow out and stop feeling sorry for himself, but that never happen.  Why Rose would fall in love with such a wimp and why Declan, a gorgeous, superstar who loved to write songs and sing, could think his life was awful was beyond my comprehension.  His constant complaining and feeling sorry for himself just got to me.  So many pages were wasted on his lamentations that I kept hoping Rose would find someone else and give Declan the brush off he deserved.  I have absolutely no sympathy for someone who has everything who hates his life and feels sorry for himself.  If you think you can stand that type of character by all means read this book - otherwise pass.  By the way there are some very depressing segments in this book that that gave me another reason not to like it, but obviously did not bother other readers - at least these events were a relief from Declan's constant complaining.	2004-05-26

Love, passion, sacrifice and faith were all there.  Jenna was strong, and I disagree with the reader who said she took too long to accept the Leor lifestyle. Jenna and Arion were perfect and Spangler brought them together in just the right way spending just the right amount of time or their differences and on how they come to love each other.  This is one of the best series I've read.  It is better enjoyed in order, but any way you read these books will prove that Spangler is a great writer.  I hope she continues with this series.

Not only was it exciting and sensual, it tied up most of the loose ends that had been hanging on from prior books and it brought all the characters back together like a great reunion.  I loved Edge, thought Amber was terrific and her family one of the best vampire groups, neck and neck with Christine Feehan's Dark series.

Most of it contained descriptions of rooms, places, dreams, people, but the action didn't take the reader much beyond the previous book.  The only thing that really happened is that Merry defended herself once again at her aunt's court, acquired a total of 16 lovers and perhaps or perhaps not became immortal.  The book was short for the time it takes for the next one to be published and lacked the sexual and sensual parts that we have come to expect from this series.  Sex was mostly metaphysical and the little \\"real\\" sex that took place was not as exciting as in the other two books in this series.  On the one hand this would have been a welcome surprise if there had been more substance to the rest of the book, but without sex and with almost no story the book left me disappointed considering that I waited a year for it to arrive.	2004-02-10

It seems that Lucerne is not married in Love Bites so it must be a prequel to SWV, but how can that be when Etienne is also single in SWV.  I assume Sands has no intention of making these books reflect the passage of time and will make all the brothers still single when Bastien finds his mate.  It works much better when the characters continue their lives as the books develop and much more enjoyable to read how things are going.  This book is not nearly as funny as SWV and the story is not as interesting nor is the love between the two as captivating.  If the next book in this series has not yet been written, there might still be time to pull the lives of these brothers all together.  Here's hoping.	2004-01-14

I am giving it three stars because it is not what I expect from a romance novel. I must worn anyone who is a romance novel reader that this is one sad story.  I cried all the way through the last 100 pages and even in some of the earlier ones.  Romance is a very minor part of this story and none of the sex scenes were described in any detail - they just happened.  I cannot really recommend this book unless you can stand the pain of the story.  Some may see it as one woman's triumph over whatever life threw at her, but it was more than I could handle.  I don't mind some unpleasant moments in  a romance novel, but for the most part of want to be happy when I close the book.  I'm sure it's going to take me a long time to get over this novel.  Hopefully, I can find other romance novels to read that will uplift my spirits.  Some may love this book, as is obvious from other reviews, but I for one wish I had been warned about its content. Beatrice Small is a great writer and her sense of history is fantastic, but I am a romance novel reader not a history buff, and I do hate to be left with a great feeling of sadness when I am finished reading.  BE FORWARNED.	2004-01-09

Not only is this about Zarek, but also about Acheron and Simi, giving the reader insight into two complex characters.  Other Dark Hunters are introduced who may play roles in future books and Zarek's life is laid out for the reader in such detail that it is almost to heartbreaking to read.  The romance between Zarek and Astrid is wonderfully detailed.  If I had only one Dark Hunter book to choose to read it would be this one.  You will not be disappointed.  There is action, excitement, tears, joy and all the emotions that make a great story.  Run don't walk to your nearest bookstore or computer and purchase this book for a terrific read.	2003-12-17

I like Feehan's Dark Series so much I didn't believe any of her books could be bad.  Well, I was wrong.  I could barely get past the first 100 pages without skipping over an endless array of boring passages.  Then I wound up skipping entire chapters and finally skipping to the end.  This is an extremely dull read that moves at a snail's pace with so much angst and pseudo-terror that I could barely stand the story line.  Maybe a true lover of dark, gothic tales would like this, but that's not me, so I would recommend skipping this and saving your money for Ms. Feehan's Dark Series which are absolutely great reads and breathtakingly sensuous.	2003-11-22

On top of that the book had intensely erotic sex scenes between two great characters, lots of tension, a mystery and smooth sailing almost until the end, where it got bogged down and left me slightly incomplete. I wanted Christian's problem solved, which I hope happens in some future novel, but I doubt it will. Still I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves sensuality, enjoys a good frolic and bursts of hysterical laughter. Hope you have as much fun reading it as I did.	2003-11-21

The romance was flat, the story was not really about the vampire and her mortal lover but, instead, became a rescue mission which placed the main characters and the romance in a very secondary position.  You never get the feeling they have really connected, because more than half the story about Seraphina and Willem takes place in the their minds and in the past. Also, I am so tired of Stiles and his group of vampire hunters.  All the stories are beginning to sound repetitive.  In this book, the re-formed DPI takes precedence over the romance and spoils everything.  The ending is depressing, unsatisfying and does not solve the problem between the mortal and the vampire.  Surely there will be a sequel, but the momentum between the lovers will be lost.  Ending on such a sad note is unusal for Shayne's series and leaves the reader feeling disappointed and empty.  If you are following the &quot;Wings in the Night&quot; series you will have to read this one, because somewhere along the line there will be more about this couple, or should be, and you'll need to know the story.  If you are just reading for pleasure, then skip this one because there is no pleasure to be found in it.  It's too dark and dreary to be enjoyable. I hope Ms. Shayne gets back to the love and romance that makes this vampire series so enjoyable.  Let the dark stuff take a minor role like it did in previous books.	2003-11-17

It spends too much time on the Scarpetti family whose escapades are really ho hum, silly and boring.  I barely got through the book with a sigh of relief hoping I never see this family again.  My advice, read all the other dark books and skip this one.  You won't be missing a thing.	2003-10-29

I was hoping that this would continue to excite me and keep me enthralled.  Not only could I put this book down, I could hardly pick it up again.  Why in the world would someone write such trivial dialogue and take the the usual sexy carpathian and turn him into a boring character.  Where is the lust, love, sex and especially power. Where is the lifemate that is more than just a sex object.  How did Byron become so tame?  Was it his torture in Dark Prince that did it?  A very sad commentary on the Dark series and a great disappointment.  It is just a set up for future books in this series at the expense of the characters and plot.  I wouldn't mind another book on Byron from a different approach.  Say one that recovers the raw power, dark mystique and steamy sexuality of the true carpathian hero-lover.  I hope we find it again in the next novel.  Don't buy this one.  Borrow it from a friend or from the library, because you will never want to read it again.	2003-10-29

It has love, action, terror and is full of surprises.  I like the inclusion of the characters from &quot;Shades of Gray.&quot;  I thought Edward and Grigori's stories combined to make a really exciting book.  Unlike some other reviewers, I thought Edward received enough attention.  I liked Kelly and love Marissa and their relationship with the vampires.  Khira was an added thrill and Ted brought some humor into a really terrifying situation.  Amanda Ashley has really done it this time with both &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; and &quot;After Sundown.&quot;  Read them in sequence and you are in for a really terrific weekend.  Pay no attention to the negative comments.  I am a vampire novel fan and have read so many I can't count them.  These two novels are at the top of my list for every reason that one reads vampire novels.  You will not be disappointed.	2003-10-22

This third one left me cold.  It was slow, garbled, inconsistent with previous books and completely out of character for Sookie and Bill.  I was so disappointed with the ending that I thought I would just try another series by a different author.  This book makes almost no sense on its own, so if you don't continue reading the next in the series you will have not idea if what happened in this book means the end for Sookie and Bill.  Unlikely, I suppose since this is a Romance novel series, but I never heard of one that ends with such a cliffhanger.  Completely unsatisfying novel.	2003-10-10
US	51197187	RE2J7FMWSSY5J	0375761306	855730967	Hair Rules!: The Ultimate Hair-Care Guide for Women with Kinky, Curly, or Wavy Hair	Books	3	32	37	N	Y	Hair Rules is Not for Everyone	I purchased this book thinking it was about all women with curly hair, because the dust jacket and introduction leads you to believe that all women with curly hair can benefit from reading it. While this is probably true to some extent, its primary focus is on African American women. I would give it 3 stars for all women and 5 stars for African American women. So depending on your hair type, this book may or may not be a useful tool in caring for your curly locks.	2003-05-28
