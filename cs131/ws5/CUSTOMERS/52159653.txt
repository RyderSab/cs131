This book is filled with a lot of information on the historical background of home schooling here in America.  It lists many examples of home schooled children that went on to become some of the most important people in American history (basically most of the founders of the USA).  Klicka also has a lot of statistics that show the success of today's average home schooled students when compared to average public education students.  The book has been around for years, and this is a new, updated, version of that old book.  Since this book was first written the number of home schoolers has skyrocketed.  After reading this book, one can fully understand why most public school teachers choose to send their own children to private schools (if they don't choose to home school).  Klick know from where he speaks. He is the head of the Home School Legal Defense Association that assists home schoolers around the country.  He and his wife have home schooled all of their children and he is dedicated to the cause as part of his religious convictions.  Today, there a many people, including many non-religious ones, who are choosing to home school, and Klicka is one of the people who have made that option possible today by making sure their rights to do it are kept intact. If you have even the slightest interest in possibly home schooling your children, then this is the book to start with.	2004-09-15

His credentials speak for themselves.  He pulls no punches in detailing what he thinks is wrong with America's educational system.  Not a lifelong career teacher, he started out as a substitute teacher and went on to become (twice) the Teacher of the Year in New York.  Gatto makes some great observations about all the ways children learn, and don't learn, in America's schools. He makes the point that kids should be taught in a manner that works best for them, not put into a one size fits all type of educational system and moved along, year after year because that's the way things are.  Gatto makes you think about the way you may have been edaucated; and that is not necessarily in the classroom at school.  I was fortunate enough to have some radically different teachers when I was young, and their influence on me still has an effect on me.  John Gatto is one of those types of radical teachers who, no doubt, has a long reaching effect on his students because he wants them to learn, not just to fit into some type of system.  I have lost my copy of this book and I am going to buy another one!!	2004-09-15

Corrie wrote many books after this one, but this is by far the most famous.  Billy Graham's organization made a movie out of this story during the 1970's with the same title.  This is the story of a family of devout Christians who did all they could to help those in need when they were facing the terrible occupation of their country during World War Two.  There are many memorable parts of the book, but one of my favorites is when a prison Lieutenant is discussing with Corrie the value of mentally retarded  children.  Corrie and her sister had done work with retarded children as part of their church work.  The Lieutenant told her that surely God did not value a \\"half-wit as much as a normal person.\\" The response by Corrie was, \\"How would I know if God does not value a half-wit more than he does a watchmaker (Corrie's profession).  Or, even a Lieutenant.\\"  That response by Corrie ended their conversation.  That is one of the passages that has stuck with me, along with many others.  This book brings to mind that there are many people right now, that are suffering, or imprisoned, for their religious beliefs, and makes that fact more real.	2004-09-15

The author mentions all the obstacles he had in writing this book and does not try to make it seem like it is an authorized biography in any way.  He does give you a look at Arnold without the childish self-promoting efforts that Arnold's autobiography seems to try.  This is a fun book, with a slight edge to it like you're reading something that might have been printed in a tabloid were it not printed in a book.  You can almost feel like you are sneeking around with the author trying to find out information about Arnold that is not some sort of publicity stunt.  It might not be the most fair look at Arnold, but then again neither is Arnold's autobiography.  I think the real story might be found somewhere in between the two books.	2004-09-13

This book is put out by the Christian Research Institute, and has a lot of references cited.  There is a lot of information, and it gives a Christian worldview of UFO's and what is behind them.

Vernon spends the first half of the book telling his view of the department and what his career was like and how it ended during the aftermath of the LA Riots of 1992.  If you are intersted in police work and in the LAPD in particular you will enjoy that part.  If you are interested a police officer's view during the Los Angeles Riots of 1992 it also for you.  Robert Vernon's father was a 20-year veteran of LAPD and he tells of his father's frustaration of working in the (then) terribly corrupt department. Vernon then writes of his rise up the ranks and chronicles the evolution of the department during his time there.   <br /> <br />The second part of the book deals with Vernon's observations on American society and the things that have contributed its changes, not all of them for the better.  These personal observations seem to be the recollections of an older gentleman who wishes to impart some of his aquired knowledge to a younger generation that might have a chance to make some changes for the better.   <br /> <br />I met Mr. Vernon earlier this year at a Pointman Leadership Seminar that my employer sponsored.  It was well worth my time and inspired me to read this book, which I had just aquired a month prior to the seminar.  Having met the man prior to reading the book and getting a more insightful view of what makes him tick made the book more inspiring.  I hope he might update the book and make it available to participants in his seminar as I believe he has grown a lot, spititually, since it was written and that aspect of his personality could better be presented in the book today.	2004-09-07

It is easy to read for a first grader, has nice illustrations of lots of dinosaurs, but it is very outdated.  I bought this book used and both of my kids love it, but so much has changed since it was written in 1966 that it is little more than entertainment.  It is a book you might have read when you were a child and that makes it fun to share with a kid, but once you do a little reasearch on dinosaurs, you will see that much has changed about how science looks at dinosaurs since you were a kid. I only give it two stars because it got my kids intersted in reading something on their own and that is saying a lot--even if the material is outdated.	2004-09-07

Neither of us had ever read it as children.  Our children loved hearing the story of the \\"real\\" Bambi and were sad on the nights we were unable to read to them from it.  Bambi was written not just for children and when you understand the author was a Jew who fled Nazi persecution in early 20th Century Europe, it gives you a better understanding of, and appreciation for, the underlying tones. It should also be noted that this book was banned by the Nazis because the author's ancestry.  So you may enjoy reading a \\"banned\\" book, both for you and/or your child.  Our children loved the story.  Although some of the material is a little violent for very small children, our children were able to deal with it okay.  The story contains much more than just childrens themes, such as growing up and becoming independent.  It also has the theme of equality, and not ever thinking of oneself as inferior to others just because they might have more power than you or your group.  I am very grateful that my wife and I were able to read this to our children and share the experience with them.  I was also grateful to learn about the author and what he went through in his lifetime.  It is a book that you should most definitely consider sharing with your child/children.	2004-09-06

I read it and found the book to be a pleasant surprise.  The book is about Benjamin Franklin as much as anything else.  It gives Franklin a lot of the credit that modern America seems to have forgotten about.  The Postman also gives a little type of history lesson about early America and how it actually came to be a unified nation that would someday change world history.  In a nation without TV, telephones, radio or other communication due to lack of electricity, the postal service is much more important than one could imagine.  <br /> <br />Brin's book is also a lot about women in American society and how much worse things would be for them in another, tragic, furure society.  Brin dedicates this book to the women in his life who have fascinated him and that dedication is evident throughout the book.  Brin's ability as a writer takes what might otherwise be only a dark and ugly story of futuristic nuclear disaster, and makes it one of hope for the future and appreciation for the past.   <br /> <br />As I wrote earlier, I am not a fan of fiction, but I found this worth the read.  Forget about the movie, give the book a chance and you may well agree with my appreciation for this particular work of fiction.	2004-09-06

We had told our (four and five year old) children of George Washington and his teeth since they started regular tooth brushing.  We used the story of how poor George lost all his teeth to motivate them to brush their teeth regularly.   Needless to say, they both have good dental care habits and good teeth to go with them!  This book has cute illustrations to go with the rhymes on each page and made the stories all the more real to our children.  At the back of the book there is a wonderful timeline that chronicles the story of George Washington's life and how his teeth were a big part of it.  The timeline is done in a manner that will make adults appreciate the story of George Washington's life in a new way.	2004-09-06

It is a fairly easy read and gives one a look inside Lincoln's mind and what made him such a great leader during the Civil War.  Lincoln's was so great and so important that he knew he could leave few things to the judgment of others.  Lincoln had to rely on his own experience and knowledge of things so that he would not be given less than perfect information and advice from people who wanted to impress him, please him or who had other agendas.  Lincoln's management style of MBWA (Management by Walking Around) was born out of the need to have firsthand information when it came to making many decisions while running the country during the Civil War.  MBWA is a skill he excelled at, and many managers could make good use of this method.  When my current boss first arrived in our organization, I advised him to come out and visit as much as possible in the workplace.  I had not yet read this book on Lincoln, but I had had a leader in the past who did such things and he was the best I ever had.  It was only after reading this book that I understood why that particular boss had been such a good one, and why I still remember him to this day (this was 20 years ago).  My current boss recently made a surprise visit in the workplace and found much wrong. It gave him a look at the real story of how things are and how it differs greatly from some of his junior executive officers' version of things.  The points in this book are just as true today as they were in Lincoln's day.  I can fully understand why the instructor of my supervisor's course gave this book as a gift to the students.	2004-09-06

The words are easy enough to read and the illustrations are beautiful.  We went to see the statue earlier this year and this book came home with us from the gift shop.  It was great to hear our child read it on the ferry boat as we left Liberty Island.  It was a welcome gift for our child and will be a source of fond memories.  If your child has never seen the statue and you're planning on seeing it, this book would be a nice preview for him/her.  If your child has already gone there, this would make for a nice memory builder.  It is great for a child about 4-6 years old with an affection for the statue and who is interested in learning to read or build up their early reading skills.   <br />	2004-09-06

I have a friend who is a retired LAPD Officer of 27 years.  I have know him for a little over a year and he is a wonderful person with a great outlook on life.  I bought this book to get a better idea of what he went through while he was with the Los Angeles Police Department. He is now an officer with another, extremely small, police department after taking a few years off from police work.  I read this book over a couple of days while on vacation and it was quite enjoyable.  I discussed the book and its contents with my retired LAPD friend and it was amazing how accurate the book was when compared with my friend's recollections of the department and its subculture. Speaking with him was, at times, almost like hearing excerpts form the book!  He told some of his memories about the way a lot officers look at things after spending a few years on the force and it matched up exactly like the author's work.  If you want a look inside the LAPD subculture, this book would be a great way to start with having to make the trip to Los Angeles and spending time at the department.  It would also give you a very accurate look at what police officers in LAPD go though on a daily basis.  This book gave me a new respect for my friend and for all of those men and women who have honorably worn the badge of the Los Angeles Police Department.  My reading this book also gave my friend a new respect for me because I took the time to learn and understand what he and other LAPD Officers have gone through while on the job.  I highly recommend it.	2004-09-06

Although it is thought of as a childrens book, it has a lot of things to offer.  One of the quotes that grabbed my attention was the one where Sewell wrote, \\"Not knowing the right thing to do often does more harm in this world than wickedness itself.\\"  It is little gems like this that make this a worthwhile read for both a parent and child.  Sewell no doubt understood a lot about life that she, thankfully, left behind for others to discover in her one and only book.  My wife and I are finding there is a lot to learn from all of the books that were not part of either of our childhoods.  I am grateful to be able to able to be learning about them now, and to be able to share them with our children.   <br /> <br />This book is easy to read, not too long, and easy for little ones to follow along with. It also has a lot of little gems in it that are there if you pay attention to them. Although it is a story about horses that children will most likely love, there is a lot for the adult reader to gain by reading it, too. <br /> <br />	2004-09-06

If you have an interest in the movie, or you are seeking a simple motivational book, this is for you.

A friend of mine recently sent me a letter that mentioned this book and it brought back the memories of when I read it many years ago.  The thing that I remember most about this book was Denton's deep faith in God, and how it sustained him through his ordeal in the North Vietnamese prison system during the Viet Nam war.  Another thing I recall was the picture it painted of American servicemen keeping themselves united during an impossible situation.  Denton's amazing courage and ingenuity by blinking his eyes to spell out the word &quot;TORTURE&quot; (in Morse Code) during a filmed interview is one of the most incredible events of the American POW chapter of the Viet Nam War.  Denton's (and the rest of the Ameican POWs) ability to maintain sanity while suffering through such conditions is a testament to the American spirit, and it makes one think deeply about what it means to be an American.  This book should be required reading for anyone who an interest in the Viet Nam War, American Military heritage, or just in American patriotism in the most extreme of circumstances.  I highly recommend it.	2004-07-16

He mentions how one of his captors called him &quot;an old man&quot; when he found out Purcell was forty, and then actually showed him an odd sort of respect as a result.  What Purcell faced in the prison system was a lot different from that show of respect, and Purcell gives a good account of that experience. The book is well written, and gives you a firsthand look at the POW experience. He writes about his deep Christian faith, and how it played an important part in his survival while imprisoned.  The book goes into detail about Purcell's two(!) escapes from the prison system, and his subsequent punishements.  It is a quick read and would be interesting for anyone looking to read about the American POW experience--or the experience of the wife of a POW--during the war. It would also be interesting for someone looking to read about that experience from a Christian's viewpoint.	2004-07-16

It is a very worthwhile read.  Williams chronicles his upbringing in the midwest and how it differed from most of his friends (piano practice while the others played in the street).  He also gives an intimate look at how valuable that upbringing was to him as an adult (childhood friends in prison while he was trying to make it in the entertainment field).  This introduction gives a good background for the frustration and shock at what followed the Rodney King verdict in 1992 when the news hit the streets.  These emotions prompted Williams to run out of him home (in the area of the riots) in an effort to try to do something positive in the middle of the chaos.  This sets up the story of how Williams rescued a Japanese man from attackers during the riots, and the publicity the act inspired.  Although this act was only a minor news story in the larger story of the riots, it is just as large a human story.  It is very thought provoking and makes for an interesting and quick read.  I would recommend it to anyone that wants a first person look at the riots.  My wife used it as one of many sources for a college term paper on the riots.	2001-08-15

I read this book a few years ago and used the information to do a resume for my sister and she is now a GS-09 with the USDA.  I also used it a couple of years later and I got a position with the Dept. of Defense where I am currently a GS-07.  The author gives easy to understand,  straightforward advice.  I am thankful I had it as a resource when trying  to get into the federal system.	2000-03-14

Although this book is well over 20 years old, it has some very interesting information.  I first read this book almost 10 years ago and found its  explanaiton of the UFO phenom. refreshing.  The appendix is filled with  scientific information that help one understand the topic presented.  If  you read this book and keep reminding youself how old it is you can better  appreciate it.  I wish there were more current books like it.  The best  recent book like it that I can recommend is &quot;Alien Encounters&quot; by  Chuck Missler and Mark Eastman, which I recommend if you are seeking a  different view of UFO's.	1999-10-26
