The image you have of yourself that you strive to live up to?  In his thriller, I, Carlos, Casey Dorman combines breakneck action with the question - what would happen if your self-image was radically changed and you were not aware of the change? Dorman, a psychologist with extensive experience in neurology, has created a thinking person's thrill ride.  The book can be enjoyed both for the adrenaline rush of the hunt for a would-be presidential assassin and for the fundamental questions it raises about what determines a person's identity.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout and gives you something to think about afterward.	2005-09-09

The history seemed well researched.  Some of the characters are interesting (although others could be cardboard cutouts.) the concept is intriguing.  The major weakness, in my opinion, is that the book is not very well written.  The author shows Grant looking up from a dead body on the bed and noticing that the pictures on the walls are watercolors by local artists. What's with that?  Frequently, when Grant is put in an embarassing or uncomfortable situation he thinks, \\"This is worse than Cold Harbor\\" or some other battle. Not at all believable.

Holmes and Russell explore their relationship while escaping from danger in the first book and investigating for Mycroft.  I found the background of Jerusalem after the first world war intriguing, and the interplay of cultures compelling.  It is interesting that the author made references to this adventure in previously written books since this one takes place at and earlier time than some books (the same time as The Beekeeper's Apprentice.) I suspect that she had in mind that she would tell this story at some point.  Perhaps the research took some time.<br />The testing that Russell and Holmes go through in this book make the changes in the characters when they return to London in the first book realistic.  I admire the writing craft as true to the individual plot and true to the development of the characters during the series.  I'd love to sit down and talk to the author about this book.	2004-05-26

I found her Through the Narrow Gate which was a narative about her seven years in a convent to be alternately enlightening and horrifying about how she was treated as an adolescent and then a young woman hpoing to become a nun.  The Spiral Staircase describes what happened next and it continues to show both how sensitive and how cruel we human can act toward one another.  The author moved from the cloister to the world of academia and then to teaching treasuring the moments of unexpected grace and surviving the insults of narrow minded tormentors.  All the while she had undiagnosed temporal lobe epilepsy.  Psychiatric (mis)treatment seems to be the only part of her life in which she found no redeeming features.  With the publication of Through the Narrow Gate, Ms. Armstrong became engaged in activites designed to show the exploititve side of religion.  When she became medically stable and through academic exploration of her unbelief she found herself slowing climbing the spiral staircase toward the re-experince of the holy.  This is a fascinating account of one person' spiritual journey.	2004-05-10

King<br />presents us with a novel that echoes the time and pace of the surroundings - the moor.  As many reviewers noted, the pace is slow.  Time is spent on atmosphere, character development, and in subltle humor that will not be to the taste of everyone.  I liked this book better than books two and three in the series, but that might have been because I was in the mood for more leisurely pursuits than when I read the other two.  I think Ms. King handled the challenge of returning to the scene of perhaps Holmes' most famous case, in a deft and successful way, but don't read this immediately after watching an Indiana Jones movie.

As an American, I found her point of view interesting, her depiction of Americans condescending and her history not well researched. She makes some good comparisons (Lincoln's family of origin as being like &quot;white trash&quot;)  some wildly off base statements  (Lincoln's religous statements may have been disingenuous) and I frankly found her personal travelog to be pretty much a bore.  If you want to know about Lincoln there are dozens, probably hundreds, of more accurate books. If you want to know how the person of Lincoln still manages to seep through to even an unwilling investigator, this book has some interest.	2004-05-04

Since it is the lot in life of every human being to spend time at routine, unglamorous tasks, it is no surprise that those who seek contact with God can find it while sweeping the floor or commuting to work.  Ms. Norris describes &quot;women's work&quot; such as hanging laundry on the line to dry, caring for children and washing dishes as potentially spiritual events.  This is not pie in the sky.  She does not deny the distractions and pain of everyday life or the struggle against depression, anger and despair that we all have. She just presents another way of looking at and experiencing the routine with a poet's sensitivity.	2004-04-30

According to the priest as the Epsicopal church, I am still a heathen but no longer godless.&quot;  The description of her coming from no childhood experience of a church and hearing church members criticized to eventually joining a church is told in a very readable and quite touching.  Most of the book is a series of thoughts or anecdotes about judgment,sin, gratitude etc.  It is the type of book to read one ot two chapters at a time and to return to at a later time.

Like a lot of readers, I am drawn into the worlds of books and the fantasy of being an ex-cop and bookdealer is quite appealing.  After an absence of 8 year or so, John Dunning brings back his character, Cliff Janeway, ex-homicide detective and bookstore owner in a well written thriller that is a satisfying read.  Through a believeable series of events, Janeway happens to become known as a book collector and book dealer who is knowledgeable about the 19th century explorer, linguist and author, Richard Francis Burton.  A woman in her 90s appears at his store with the claim that her grandfather knew, and traveled with Burton and that his extensive signed collection of Burton's books was stolen from her by a family of shady booksellers.  On her deathbed Janeway promises to investigate.  The murder of a friend solidifies his resolve and the reader is taken into a variety of interesting worlds.  First, there is the world of books, book scouts, collectors and bookstore owners.  Then, there is the world of the Antebellum American South where Burton may or may not be a spy for the British government.  Also, there is  the dangerous world of hoodlums and murder which Janeway must navigate and survive if he is to solve the various mysteries.  The author strains credibility at times, and the coincidences require an unusual effort on the part of the reader to suspend disbelief.  More than once I found myself doubting that a character would act in a particular way needed to further the plot.  Therefore I could not rate this five stars.  Still, it is an interesting book and the return of a compelling character.  You will have to read it to find out how the mysteries get resolved, if Janeway gets the girl and whether or not Burton was a spy.	2004-03-29

The author talks about becoming aware at age 9 that he is \\"different.\\"  He talks about the isolation, fear and self condemnation that left him vulnerable to exploitation and violence.  He talks about his struggle to deny a part of himself through religion, prayer, marriage, fatherhood, counseling within the church, and therapy. The author talks about discovering, to his horror, in casual conversation that a friend he admired used to lure homosexual men into a quiet place so the friend and others could beat the homosexual men with baseball bats.  The author also talks about a \\"church counselor\\" who claimed to be able to help people \\"overcome\\" their homosexuality.  That man admitted that he wanted to \\"line all the homosexuals up and shoot them.\\"  I admire the author's honesty and willingnes to discuss his internal homophobia.  I find this to be an enlightening and ultimately uplifting book about coming to terms with who you are.	2004-03-29

For Nevada Barr it is a workable effort and fans of Anna Piegeon especially will want to read it.  I like the idea of taking away Anna's badge and gun and letting her experience life through the eyes of a waitress, not a ranger.  The author gets some humor from this; she could have had more.  Anna is a compelling character.  On the down side the mysteries are pretty predictable.  I was actually surprised only once.  Also Anna acts like a rookie repeatedly just to advance the plot.  But then, I guess anybody could have an off week or so.  Personally I find the settings and the characters more interesting than the mysteries anyway.  If you have not read the series don't start with this one.  If you want to read just one Nevada Barr try Blind Descent or Firestorm.	2004-03-28

First, there is the world of the book scout where the author describes finding and collecting valuable books.  Janeway is now a bookstore owner and his purchase of a first edition of 19th century daredevil, linguist and explorer Richard Francis Burton leads to a radio interview, which gets picked up by newspapers on a slow news day and the publicity attracts a woman in her 90s who claims that the book was part of a collection scammed away from her family by an unscrupulous family of book sellers.  A bookperson will be interested in the author's description of writers, collectors, and publishers.  The woman introduces the second world, the United States in the 1860s where Burton and her grandfather travel the south and Burton may or may not be a spy for the British.  On her deathbed she gives another signed first edition to Janeway on the condition that he will promise to try to find the collection, which has been missing for 80 years.  Janeway promises and enters a dangerous world of murder, mobsters and crooked booksellers where nobody is quite what they appear to be.  Cracking wise and living dangerously, Janeway follows the clues and his own moral compass to find the collection, track down the murderer of a friend and, he hopes, get the girl.  If it is at times difficult to suspend disbelief at some of the plot twists and turns, it is in the end well worth the effort.	2004-03-21

In this book Elaine Pagels does a wonderful job of showing that it was never that simple.  The discoveries of the Nag Hammadi texts and other early writing (which would make the Indiana Jones movies seem tame) show that there was never a consensus about any of what seems from our later perspective to be basic questions.  Was Jeus human, divine or both?  Is there only one God or are there two or more?  Did Jesus rise form the dead physically or did his followers later experience a sense of him being present that was almost palpable?  Early church fathers - and mothers too answered the questions in every way imaginable.  True believers provided contradictory answers even within the primary organized church.  Irenaeus and other developed orthodoxy, i.e. &quot;straight thinking&quot; to correct the heresy of others.  When the early Jesus followers were not bein persecuted by the state, they were busy persecuting each other.  Pagels suggests that there was a long conflict between self discovery and personal experience as a way to understand God versus investing canonical texts as the &quot;true religion&quot; and the definitive answer to all questions.  (Of course there are contradictions between the four gospels and the letters of Paul, but that is another book.)  The history of religious convictions and political wrangling that resulted in orthodoxy is fascinating.  The author also gives us an outline of the richness of thought, belief and practice that existed in early churches. I suspect the conflicts described are still in play and to understand where we are it helps to review how we got here.  This is a very readble and thought-provoking book for non-scholars.	2004-03-18

Of the four- How the Irish Saved Civilization, The Gifts of the Jews, and Desire of the Everlasting Hills are the others- this was the least engaging to me.  Taken by itself, I enjoyed Cahill's insight and irreverent humor as he traced the rise and fall of the Greeks from the Minoans through Alexander the Great.  Using historical people or literary figures he shows us the development of the civilization in How to Fight, Feel, Party, Rule, Think and See from the perspectives of the Greeks.  He acknowledges their limitations and their massive and amazing contributions.  It was also interesting to read the first few pages about his approach to history and the last pages linking Greeks to other groups he has described.  I look forward to the other books he has planned and this is well worth reading.  Unfortunately for the author, (in my opinion) he is competing with his own earlier books and, as good as this is, it is not as good as the earlier three.	2004-03-16

It remains, however, the most literary and perhaps the most influential version. For people of a certain age, like me, this is the version we heard as children.  Biblical thinking is that the gospels were written serperately and at different times for different audiences.  It can be instructive to read them seperately.  If Luke was the only or the primary text, the early church members who read it would have had a wonderful set of stories from an author (probably not Jewish) writing comfortably in his primary language.  They would have had a great nativity narrative, parables including the Good Samaritan, Martha and Mary, the Prodigal Son and the Good Thief.  Early church members who did not have Luke available would have missed all that.  In Luke, the Sermon on the Mount was given in the valley and blessing for the poor and afflicted alternate with woes predicted for the rich and satisfied.  Luke writes about Jesus's message and mercy for all people and social judgement like forgiving debts and freeing prisoners.  Whatever else you think about the writer of Luke, he can certainly tell a story.	2004-03-09

If you follow the series you will meet characters from earlier books, but it is not necessary to appreciate this book entirely on its own.  Harry runs afowl of FBI agents assigned to use any means to uncover terrorist activities under the cover of Homeland Security.  As always, Harry will use any and all means to solve a murder from years earlier that still echoes in his mind.

This book is about a single person, Jesus.  The authors translation and thoughts give an immediate and real sense of who the man was and how civilization is different because of him.  Cahill is simply a very good writer, which makes anything he writes worth reading.  In this case the subject of his book is fascinating by himself.  I often found my self disagreeing with Cahill's opinions (e.g. that Jesus thought that an &quot;end time&quot; was fast approaching) but his reasoning was well stated and the evidence is always mixed. I do wish he had stated clearly the Mary the Magdalene (her name is Mary; she is from the city of Magdala, like today's Jimmy the Greek) was never identified in the gospels as a prostitute before he made jokes about it.  Cahill clearly makes that point, but only after he jokes about her &quot;profession.&quot;  Nevertheless, his humor is a large part of what makes the book enjoyable and the obvious respect he has for Jesus and all the apostles is another plus.  I especially recommend his description of the world pre and post Jesus and his chapter on Paul.  PS Don't skip the footnotes.	2004-03-01

He examines each line of the payer in light of the fragmentary evidence about the historical Jesus and attempts to put each thought in its context.  The result is an interesting, and sometimes unsettling picture of Jesus as a wandering sage responding to the real needs and desires of the people around him.  I personally disagree with some of his opinions (e.g. that Jesus was not a healer) but  his reasoning is clear and lucid.

Owen Parry continues his Able Jones series with another book that gives a real sense of time, place and people.  This time the place is Able's beloved hometown in the Pensylvania coal fields which turns out to be stranger than anywhere his travels have taken him so far.  Once again the author gives us thumbnail sketches of historical figures. This novel has strong gothic elements, which were, for me, the least interesting part of the book.  In additon to solving murders which nobody wants solved and working from limited information Able has to deal with his wife and son, who are changing in ways he did not anticipate.  He also has to defend his staunch Methodism against enticing secular influences.  Able is one hero aware of his own limitations...at least partially.  He does not take himself too seriously...in the end.  The book ends with a description of the slaughter of federal troops at the battle of Fredericksburg, which is, by itself, reason enough to buy this book.	2004-02-20

It is well presented in terms of time and place.  The history is accurate.  Using a young widow as the heroine gives an interesting point of view.  On the other hand, the characters, especially the heroine, are underdeveloped.  I found I did not greatly care what happened to Narcissa, which is a problem.  The supporting characters were more interesting, although they could use some development also. One character changed from a potential villain to a potentional love interest in one or two pages with very little explanation.  I am interested enough to want to read the later books in the series and there is potential.  However, this book is two or three revisions away from being a really good book.	2004-02-13

Donald identifies the handful of men who could be considered truly a friend of Lincoln and gives us a view of Lincoln from their vantage.  He deals briefly with the possibility that Lincoln was gay and charges that Lincoln invited the attack on Fort Sumter.  Of more interest is the description of Lincoln with friends. Donald speculates on why many people admired Lincoln but did not consider themselves intimate friends.  This short book is easy to read and it presents more information on Lincoln the man.	2004-02-05

Some sections are painful to read and others are funny or joyful (like life itself.)  It is interesting that even in our secular society people still ask the questions Job asked and still try to find meaning for themselves like Abraham and Sarah.

As a novel it is engaging and memorable; the story of an ordinary girl who becomes a woman and the time and family she lives in.  What offends some people and fascinates others is the heroine and her family are religious icons in three major religions.  Fleshing out details and imagining alternative events is part of the relgious tradition of at least two of the religions (and arguably the third.)  If you find speculation and imagination about relgious topics undesirable, then this book is clearly not for you. If, on the other hand, you find the thoughts and meditations of others about religious matters stimulates thinking and reflection of your own, then this is a book to read.<br />The author's characterization of some biblical figures is far from my own, for others her \\"take\\" is quite close to what I imagine.  For example. I admit that I have always thought that Essau got short shrift in the bilical tales and I like his depiction here.  If you want the old stories told the old way look elsewhere.	2004-01-26

They offer not only the words of Lincoln as recalled by others, but also their opinions on the probable accuracy of the person who recalled the words.  I found quotes I had never heard and I noted that some quite famous &quot;quotes&quot; were debunked.  This is as close to the &quot;real words&quot; of Lincoln we are able to get outside his writings and newspaper reports of his speeches.  Of course, written words, carefully crafted speeches and spontaneous spoken words are all different.  Thanks to the editors for massive amounts of careful work.	2004-01-26

It seems to me that she started with a religion of the head (understanding through intellect, history, language and cultural background) and then came to experience something outside and greater than herself.  This book is less a work of scholarship and more a personal revelation.  Along with other books about the early church, there seems to be a developing school of thought that the early church was more diverse and less well defined than reading the gospels might imply.  I found her description of how the gospels became THE GOSPELS to be informative without being unnesccesarily critical of those involved.  This is not the most research-based and empirical book available on the topic; it an interesting personal statement with an introduction to contmeporary religious scholarship and well worth reading on its own merits.	2004-01-23

In another time she could have been a CEO or an attorney.  It is easy to see what Lincoln was attracted to and how Mary was likely to resond to a man interested in  her thoughts and political insights, not just her family background and prospects as a mother.

LINCOLN, ESQUIRE	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	lincoln the lawyer	Like everything else concerning Lincoln's life, his law practice has acquired the patina of legend over the years.  Mr. Spiegel's book does an excellent job of dispelling myths and presenting Lincoln as a well respected attorney with a thriving practice. The strongest part of the book are the introductory materials and the first two chapters.  Lincoln is shown to be willing to argue any side of a case based on his clients' needs.  In a case where two men had a monetary dispute Lincoln was hired by one man for the trial and by the other man during the appeal. Reamrks about the difficulty assessing an attorney's effectiveness based on the won-loss record are well considered.<br />However, later chapters seem somewhat unfocused.  The author adds interesting tidbits unrelated to the topic and outside the time of Lincoln's practice.  I had hoped that a ten year research project would focus more extensively on his actual practice.  Still, this is a good reference for scholars and Lincoln &quot;buffs.&quot;	2004-01-16

Smith then chief of the Washington bureau of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat.  Even at that time the legends about Lincoln had begun to grow.  Understandably what people remembered, or were willing to present, probably portrayed themselves in a favorble light and presented themselves as closer to Lincoln than they may actually have been. The author himself was not above presenting material from other sources as interviews he had personaly conducted.  Keeping that in mind the book offers glimpses of an elusive historical figure from a variety of points of view from people who knew him. Editor Michael Burlingame does an admirable job of informing the reader of the limitations inherent in this kind of gahering oral history.  There is a fascination to reading about Lincoln as known by political friends and opponents, relatives and fellow attorneys, merchants and those who knew him when they were children.	2004-01-16

His easy to read but profound and it offers an invitation to all who call themselves Christian to find the common ground and underlying tennets of their shared faith.  He discusses faith, the bible, God and Jesus in a way that the &quot;unchurched&quot; might appreciate without scorning those with a very traditional understanding.  He aslo talks about living in this world as a Christian and discusses sin, salvation, being born again/from above and the kingdom of God.

She followed Jesus, witnessed the crucifixion, saw the empty tomb and was one of the first, if not the very first person, the risen Christ appeared to.  In Karen King's translation of the Gospel of Mary, she is no less remarkable.<br />Incomplete, brief and based on three fragments from the 5th and 3rd centuries the Gospel of Mary reveals what Andrew refers to as &quot;strange ideas.&quot;  In a dialogue first between the risen Savior and disciples, and then between the disciples themselves about a vision of Jesus and teachings revealed to Mary alone ideas are presented that are unique to this gospel although there are clearly echoes of these ideas in other sacred writings. For example, there is a distinction made between the material body and the soul with the true self defined as the soul alone.  Sin exists only when the soul is distracted by passions of the body and therefore is estranged from spiritual concerns.  The familiar, &quot;seek and you will find&quot; is interpreted as the need to seek inwardly to discover the spiritual that is within us all.<br />The teachings from Mary's vision of Christ are disputed by Andrew and denied by Peter who says he does not believe that Christ would tell a woman what he did not reveal to men.  Levi confronts Andrew and Peter affirming that Mary is spiritually mature and as worthy as anyone.  Levi then heeds the direction given by Jesus to go and teach the word.<br />Ms. King discusses the changing role of women in the early church and the gradual establishment of the canonical gospel.  Perhaps most interesting of all, she emphasizes the variety and diversity of early church writings and beliefs reminding us that our religious heritage is much more unsettled and unsettling than out view from the present looking backwards may suggest.	2003-12-30

Description of how decisions were made and the color coding of text for estimated authenticity were fascinating in themselves. the Jesus Seminar is much more tranparent about how it works and the weaknesses of their method than any scholarly group I am aware of.  ENRON could learn from this. News reports that only a small precentage of accepted texts could be attributed to Jesus were somewhat misleading in that the seminar did not include common phrases and amphorisms that Jesus may have used but that were not unique to him.  The story of the Gnostic Gopel of Thomas was intriguing.  Or you can ignore the controversies and just read a careful modern translation that is much more understandable than most.	2003-12-16

Keneally has the ability to make historical figures come alive which is evident in this book.  His depiction of Lincoln first arriving at Springfield is wonderful.

Walsh has done credible research and his bibliography is helpful.  He clarifys the issues in the almanac trial and provides a picture of Lincoln at work as a defense attorney as few have.  BUT..  In his introduction Walsh says, &quot;no fictional coloring has been added&quot; and eveything &quot;rests squarely on documented sources.&quot; If only that were so. The tone of the book is like an over-ripe romance novel.  I counted two !s and five usues of italics for emphasis in the introduction alone.  He virtually admits he can not prove any of his more florid conclusions.  A defense attorney is not on a quest for the truth.  He or she need only make the prosecution's case look uncertain, which is what Lincoln did.  Walsh states that Lincoln could not help the man convicted of killing Metzer, &quot;without endangering Duff [Lincoln's client.]&quot;<br />Duff had already been aquitted.  He could not have been tried for the same crime twice.  It is a shame that with all the good work he did Walsh did not present the case in a factual matter.  he could have raised very interesting ethical questions about the role of a defense attorney with a very probably guilty client.

Of all the books I have read associated with the Jesus Seminar (I have not read them all) this is the nastiest in tone, the least informative about the historical Jesus and most lacking in humor.<br />Ms. Corley's massively footnoted book seems redundant in style.  Nearly everything that she writes in one place she partially or completely contradicts in another place.  It may be that Ms. Corley wanted to be comprehensive or even-handed, but she leaves the reader uncertain of many of her points.  Her extensive criticism of Elisabeth Schussler Fiorenza's classic In Memory of Her seems to center primarily on the idea that Ms. Fiorenza was too willing to consider the suggestion of others that Jesus' egalitarianism<br />and inclusion of women (although not unique) could be interpreted as something like feminism.  Ms. Corley admits that Jesus was egalitarian and inclusive, but she argues that since he was not concerned about women as women and not as interested in challenging gender roles as in challenging social and economic inequity.  Therefore Jesus should not be considered a feminist.<br />There are many speculations in the book for which she offers little or no evidence.  There may be reason to believe that Greco-Roman culture saturated even rural Jewish Palestine.<br />There may be reason to believe that Jesus criticized reburial practices and not the patriarchal family structure.  I did not find the reasons in this book.<br />I was struck by the negative tone of the book.  For example, in every case where there was a dispute about the meaning of individual words the author favored the translation most demeaning to women.  In reviewing the parables, Ms. Corley noted critically that women were depicted in traditional roles.  Don't parables by design start in familiar, almost stereotypical fashion so that the twist at the end is even more shocking?  If a parable started, \\"Mary, commander of the army\\" would the listeners attend to the parable past that?  Ms. Corley states that being forced to stay in marriages is, \\"worse for women than for men.\\"  In every case?<br />On the positive side I found the discussion of slavery interesting and informative.  Ms. Corley make a strong and persuasive argument that author's trying to draw a distinction between Judaism and Christianity can easily end up distorting and short changing Judaism.  Her suggestion that Mary might have been form a somewhat higher social class than Joseph was new to me and interesting.<br />Unfortunately, I can not recommend this book.in familiar, almost stereotypical fashion so that the twist at the end is even more shocking?

The results are thoughtful and, no doubt, controversial.  He covers a lot of ground in a very few pages.  I believe he also gives us a sense of what Jesus may have been like. For an attempt at de-mythological description, I find it amazingly spiritual.  If you find value in trying to put a human face on the man who became a religious icon (as I do) I recomend this book highly.	2003-04-03

In my opinion this illustrates the main point of the book, i.e. that people either evaluate things based on medical evidence, on the opinion of experts, or on their personal belief based on personal life experience/expectations.  The different ways of evaluation produce conflicting perceptions, conflicting world views which we see played out many aspect of life.  I think that Dr. Angell is gutsy to even take on an issue which generates  tremendous controversy.  I believe that she presents the arguments for medical evidence very well. Chapter 5 is the best brief and understandable description of what medical evidence is (and is not) that I have ever read.  I recommend the book on that alone.  I hope that some day Dr. Angell will update the book to include more recent research.	2003-02-03
