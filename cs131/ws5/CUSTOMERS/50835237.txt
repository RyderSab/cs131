For me the main character's occasional thoughts of her youth as a child beauty and talent show competitor with a classic stage mama pushing her brought to mind every picture of JonBenet Ramsey i have ever seen -- a beautiful child who would never have had a real childhood even if she had lived and whose eyes seemed to show that even at age six she had already realised it.<br /><br />In any other company, the Harris would probably have been the standout.<br /><br />But Barbara Hambley's piece, about the evil that lives on in a former sweatshop that was the site of a disastrous fire reminiscent of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, is the absolute standout for me, not only for its superior handling of the dark elements of the supernatural, but for personal resonances because i recognise some of her sources and was caught up in her resolution of them.<br /><br />Excellent book overall	2004-12-18
US	50835237	R310EAS2PGBI7K	0743488393	618108652	The Wizard of Karres	Books	3	23	27	N	N	Falls Afoul of the Usual Perils of Pastichery	I must admit that i approached this book with some trepidation, since i am, shall we say, not particularly impressed with Eric Flint's \\"editing\\" (for want of a better word) of the rest of the James Schmitz canon, nor with Lackey's general record of not even keeping up with her *own* series' backstories (see the reviews for \\"Exile's Valor\\"), and because i didn't have any idea who Freer was.<br /><br />(I have not yet gotten hold of a copy of an un-tampered-with edition \\"Witches of Karres\\" to see how extensively Flint \\"edited\\" that volume; a quick skim of the Baen version showed nothing immediately obviously egregious there, though.}<br /><br />That out of the way, if this were an original story, i'd probably give it four stars, rather than the three i have -- but if it were an original story, i doubt it would have ever been published; it's a niche story, and without Scmitz's brilliant original to follow up to, the niche wouldn't exist.<br /><br />As to the story itself: it falls prey to the most common problems writers of pastiche run afoul of -- first of which is often trying to put in references to everything from the original, whether the new story needs them or not.  Thus we have references to tinklewood fishing poles and TotiSystem Toys, among other things.  And lots and lots of vatches.<br /><br />Another problem writers of pastiche may trip over is a tendency to retcons (\\"RETroactive CONtinuity\\") of the original story, explaining at length things that need no explanation, which can be particularly annoying if the retcon involves background material that wouldn't have been available to the original writer (the explanation given here of the formal name of one character from \\"Witches\\" is one such).<br /><br />But, if those are your worst problems in writing such a work, then you're doing pretty good, and Flint, Lackey and Freer have, indeed, done Pretty Good.<br /><br />The story is rather complex -- to say the least -- and i wouldn't even try to summarise it, both because such a summary would of necessity be both long and confusing and becuase it would, of necessity, involve at least some amount of spoilers.<br /><br />They have crested a complex political intrigue out of characters and situations which were basically throw-aways in the first book, and play it out well.<br /><br />Mostly they succeed in mimicking Schmitz's almost laconic, low-key narrative style, but depart from it in having parallel plots going at various points -- i cannot remember any of Schmitz's own work that do so, unless possibly it's the story that teames Telzey and Trigger -- and in telling parts of the story from other viewpoints than Captain Pausert's.<br /><br />Their handling of Pausert's continuing discovery of his own abilities at manipulating the mystical klatha energy that the Witches of Karres use nicely mimick and continue Schmitz's handling of similar material in the original, and the continuing development of Pausert and Goth's relationship rings true.<br /><br />Goth's sister, the Leewit, is along to add to the fun, and old spacer(and burglar/spy) Vezzarn and former Imperial agent Hulik do Eldel, now working with Pausert, are well used, although they do tend to fade into the background when not needed stage front.<br /><br />Pul, the grik dog, is just a bit too too.<br /><br />The sequence in which the crew of the \\"Venture\\", fleeing Imperial Security, sinister aliens and the pirates of the Agandar (a pirate lord vanquished by Pausert & Co in the first book) take refuge aboard a circus ship is well-done, though i do question whether the plays of Shakespeare would have survived virtually unchanged in the apparent history that Schmitz set up in the first book, with Earth a virtual legend of the distant past, so far off that even the name has become \\"Yarthe\\".<br /><br />In the end, all comes out well and right -- though with hints of possibly another volume in the offing, and echoes of \\"Prisoner of Zenda\\" (or perhaps Heinlein's \\"Double Star\\").<br /><br />I do feel as if there are some inconsistencies in continuity -- mainly that though i have the impression that Pausert & Co were again running under the forged ship's papers and identities created for them by the Daal's document specialists on Uldune, people who shouldn't have the faintest idea that Captain Aron of the \\"Evening Bird\\" out of Mulm and his niece Dani are actually Pausert of the \\"Venture\\", out of Nikkeldepain, and Goth, a possible Karres witch, keep calling him \\"Pausert\\"...<br /><br />One assertion i've noticed in a couple of reviews of this book is that Schmitz never wrote a sequel; i understand that the situation is a bit different -- that he did, indeed, write one, but that the manuscript was lost and he never got around to reconstructing it.  However, the fact that H. Beam Piper's third \\"Little Fuzzy\\" novel, long thought lost, finally did materialise, gives me some faint hope.<br /><br />(And, while Schmitz had a fondness for odd-ball names -- i still treasure \\"Gefty Rammer\\" -- somehow, \\"Vonard Kleesp\\" seems to me a bit over the top...)rhaps Heinlein's \\"Double Star\\"). <br /> <br />I do feel as if there are some inconsistencies in continuity -- mainly that though i have the impression that Pausert & Co were again running under the forged ship's papers and identities created for them by the Daal's document specialists on Uldune, people who shouldn't have the faintest idea that Captain Aron of the \\"Evening Bird\\" out of Mulm and his niece Dani are actually Pausert of the \\"Venture\\", out of Nikkeldepain, and Goth, a possible Karres witch, keep calling him \\"Pausert\\"...  <br /> <br />One assertion i've noticed in a couple of reviews of this book is that Schmitz never wrote a sequel; i understand that the situation is a bit different -- that he did, indeed, write one, but that the manuscript was lost and he never got around to reconstructing it.

OVERALL CONCLUSION:  Not at all a bad book as Lackey's volumes go, but with structural problems and some minor errors of real-world fact.[1]  Worth buying if you're already a fan, but i'd recommend, say, \\"Arrows of the Queen\\" or \\"By the Sword\\" as a first experience with Lackey's work.<br />REVIEW: There are a number of problems in writing a long series of books set in a common history but out of order -- and one of the biggest is that you may find yourself handcuffed by something that seemed like a good idea when you mentioned it in passing twenty-odd (some of them very odd) years ago.  In the intervening time, unfortunately, your own perception of your setting and characters may have changed significantly, or you may find youself stuck with having to actually wrie events that you merely alluded to in the earlier work.<br />In this book, Lackey finds herself stuck with having to relate the story of unfortunate (to say the least) events in the early life of Queen Selenay of Valdemar, alluded to way back in her first book, \\"Arrows of the Queen\\" and in later books in the series.<br />While she was merely alluding to these events, and summarising some aspects of them to set up plots in other books, all was well.<br />Now she has to actually *write* about it, and convince the reader that a very smart person -- no matter how young and emotionally traumatised -- could be so deceived and taken in by an out-and-out phony who is a tool of a plot to sieze power; the problem here is that, for me and others with whom i have discussed the book, she simply doesn't make it.<br />Even ten or so years younger, the Selenay presented here is just not the Selenay of the earlier books.<br />That's a problem.<br />A not-quite-a-problem but nonetheless a bit jarring, is alluded to in this review's title -- \\"Mary Sue\\" is a term coined originally in \\"Star Trek\\" fandom to describe a fan fiction story in which a shy, unassuming minor character -- who just happens to closely resemble the author -- is the Only One Who Can Save The Day, and in the process, earns the undying gratitude (if not love) of The Dashing Captain (or perhaps The Vulcan Science Officer).<br />Lo and be held, in this book we have the reappearance of Herald-Chronicler Myste, who, it turns out, takes an interest in Weaponsmaster Herald Alberich that goes beyond their work together.  \\"Myste\\"? Hmmm.[2]<br />That said, the teamwork of Alberich and Myste, and their quite plausible gradual discovery and thwarting of a Heinous Plot against Valdemar itself, is the primary focus of the book, and is well-enough told that i feel justified in awarding the three stars that i have, as opposed to the one or two that the \\"plot against Selenay\\" and \\"Mary Sue\\"-ish elements ought to rate.<br />(A possible name coincidence i like is that an actor who specialises in athletic roles in which he uses extravagant and mostly-bogus fighting styles is named \\"Norris\\"...)<br />====================================================<br />[1]The story begins with the punishment of a couple of students who break an incredibly-expensive full length mirror in the salle who are sent to pump bellows and so on for some months at the glassmakers' guild's main manufactory until the replacement mirror canbe made.<br />In the course of setting this up, the Master Glassmaker repeats the widely-held belief that glass slowly flows and that older panes of glass are thicker at the bottom than at the top because of this.<br />That just isn't trus -- a quick websearch led me to the page [...] which thoroughly debunks this myth -- and also, in a quick mention, leads me to the second \\"everybody knows\\" about glass that Lackey mentions:<br />That cheap \\"bullseye\\" glass panes (thicker in the center than at the edges, distorting anything seen through them), used in windows in poorer dwellings or taverns, are made in a mold.  Well, this may well be true for reproduction bullseye panes made nowadays -- but, if you were makng glass for windows ina mold, wouldn't you try to have it of more or less uniform thickness, without circular ridges that distort vision?<br />In fact, bullseye panes were/are made by spinning a glob of molten glass to cause it to flatten out in a disc shape (thus explaining the extra-thick center and the circular patterning around it), a technique discovered by the Romans about 100AD, as detailed at [...]<br />[2]At least they aren't lifemates yet; Lackey [as also Miller and Lee in their \\"Liaden\\" stories (q.v.)] is fond of telling us how rare true lifemate bondings are, but it seems as if, in her writings, all it takes is for two characters of romantically-compatible gender to shake hands and they're lifemated...mold, wouldn't you try to have it of more or less uniform thickness, without circular ridges that distort vision?<br />In fact, bullseye panes were/are made by spinning a glob of molten glass to cause it to flatten out in a disc shape (thus explaining the extra-thick center and the circular patterning around it), a technique discovered by the Romans about 100AD, as detailed at [...]<br />[2]At least they aren't lifemates yet; Lackey [as also Miller and Lee in their \\"Liaden\\" stories (q.v.)] is fond of telling us how rare true lifemate bondings are, but it seems as if, in her writings, all it takes is for two characters of romantically-compatible gender to shake hands and they're lifemated...	2004-01-12

But all of the Masters who reside in the Street of the All-Seeing Eye want too much for his village to pay before they will even consider taking the case...  and then he finds the aged Master Li, dead drunk in his tiny ramshackle shack in an alley, with that half-closed eye over the door.<br />Master Li agres to take the case, and, after many hair-raising, often hilarious, sometimes touching, adventures, he and Ox manage to solve the case, answer ancient riddles, destroy a rapacious tyrant, and re-unite immortal lovers who have been seperated for centuries.  The pace is fast, and never a moment's rest for the weary.<br />All is resolved more-or-less tidily and quite satisfactorily, leaving this reader somewhat the feeling of having just completed a ride on a particularly good roller-coaster.<br />Ox and Master Li are wonderful characters, complementing each other admirably.  Ox, the narrator of their adventures, is actually quite bright and quick of mind, for all his peasant background; and that peasant upbringing has left him with a charming lack of what many would consider proper morals or scruples.  In this he is perfectly suited to be Master Li's assistant, as Master Li has no morals at all -- well, he has a fairly strict moral code of his own by which he lives, but it's not even nearly that of Society.<br />Most people would probably describe Master Li as a Bad Man -- he drinks like a fish when he's not actually on a case and steals almost anything that isn't nailed down (and anything he can pry loose, in his opinion, isn't nailed down...) and quite willing to commit casual murders if that's what it takes to solve his cases.<br />Incredibly ancient (he gets older between this book and the next, at that), tiny and so wrinkled that sometimes his eyes disappear among the wrinkles, he is still brilliant, devious and fast with a knife when needed.  Master Li goes into action riding on Ox's shoulders -- between them, there are very few foes natural or supernatural that they can't defeat.<br />And the ones they can't defeat outright, Master Li swindles.<br />In the course of this book, Ox and Master Li find themselves in and out of danger with a bewildering frequency, and have to solve a number of apparenly irrelevant riddles and mysteries before they can arrive at the ultimate cure for the children of Ox's village.<br />A wonderful book, highly recommended, as are the two sequels, &quot;The Story of the Stone&quot; and &quot;Eight Skilled Gentlemen&quot; (Ox, being an orphan, decides to relocate to the city as Master Li's permanent assistant and biographer).<br />Master Li and Ox live in &quot;an ancient China that never was&quot;, as the book's subtitle explains; a China that is a wonderful place, with actual gods and demons and dragons and what not wandering around and fantastic magic at every hand.<br />(And thereby hangs a recommendation: if you enjoy the adventures of Master Li and Ox, i cannot recommend too highly the similarly-themed but even-more-elegantly-written adventures of Kai Lung, Ernest Bramah's itinerant story teller in a similarly fabulous ancient-China-that-never-was; &quot;Kai Lung's Golden Hours&quot; would probably be a good place to start, and i believe it's currently available...)se, in his opinion, isn't nailed down...) and quite willing to commit casual murders if that's what it takes to solve his cases.<br />Incredibly ancient (he gets older between this book and the next, at that), tiny and so wrinkled that sometimes his eyes disappear among the wrinkles, he is still brilliant, devious and fast with a knife when needed.

I was the one who asked Baen Books editor Toni Weisskopf (at an SF convention) if she'd like to see a military SF novel by my brother that was getting no respect at another publisher.  I mention this at the beginning of any reviews of his work that i write.  Mostly if you check my reviews of Dave's work, you'll find the bias is toward five stars -- and not because he's my brother, but because they're Good Stuff in which (mostly) Dave plays to his strengths and minimises his weaknesses.<br />One of his weaknesses, unfortunately, is that he just can't write Villains that don't remind me of Oilcan Harry menacing Pearl Pureheart in a Mighty Mouse cartoon.<br />That's *Villains*, mind -- people like Pavel Young or Steadholder Mueller -- as opposed to Bad Guys, like the military types on The Other Side who are just doing their duty as best they can. (Rob Pierre falls somewhere between the two, and is the closest to a Villain who doesn't just do things because he's Evial, but because, at base, he actually has a more or less worthwhile End that he uses to justify his Means that Dave has successfully pulled off.)<br />Unfortunately, this book is full of Villains, all sneering and twirling their mustachios for all they're worth.<br />I suppose, for those who agree more than i do with David's politics, this book is a more satisfying read than it was for me -- in fact, i believe that i noticed a five-star review which basically said something like that -- but i bounced off it twice (once in a pre-publication manuscript that Dave e-mailed me) before finally managing to finish it.<br />Basically, there are:<br />Too much talk, not enough action.<br />Too much politics, not enough of the Real World,<br />and,<br />Too many characters, not enough people.<br />Intelligent people act uncharacteristically dumb to make the plot work.

Both are beautiful women.  And both are the toughest so-and-so in their respective New York police forces.  Both have close, personal relationships with computers. ;-)<br />And both were feral children, their lives, psyches and emotions twisted and knotted by horrific acts of violence.<br />Mallory and her partner, Riker, respond to a call in another area, helping out a squad that's short on manpower due to a recent mini-epidemic of a nasty flu.  Arriving, they find a horribly-bungled crime scene, and a hanged woman, her hair cut off and used to gag her.<br />And they know her.<br />To Riker, she had been one of his best informants when she was a junkie prostitute.  To Mallory, she was something else -- something more personal and, like so much of Mallory's past, something twisted up with pain, love, hate and emotion.<br />Both Riker and Mallory want to take this case, for their own reasons -- but their lieutenant is going to buck it back to the precinct that originally caught it... until Mallory links it to another killing, done in the same manner, twenty years before, and still unsolved.<br />Before the case is closed, more people will die, Mallory's friends (and the reader) will learn more of her past, how she survived on the streets of New York, on her own at age eight... how Detective Lou Markowitz and his wife Helen took in the feral child and, if not civilised her, at least tamed her somewhat.<br />If you've never read any of Mallory's earlier adventures, be warned -- parts of this book are going to take you where the nasty things wriggle, just outside of the light.  There are a lot of unpleasant people in this world, and cops meet most of them sooner or later.<br />But Mallory is such a fascinating character -- and her relationships with the cops she works with and the people around her are so interesting -- that the pages seem to turn themselves, and, by the time you reach the end, emotionally, the feeling is as if you'd ridden a particularly good roller coaster.<br />If you haven't met Mallory before this, do yourself a favour -- pick up her adventures, get to know her, enter her world, see it through her eyes.  It may not be pretty, but it's absolutely enthralling.hips with the cops she works with and the people around her are so interesting -- that the pages seem to turn themselves, and, by the time you reach the end, emotionally, the feeling is as if you'd ridden a particularly good roller coaster.<br />If you haven't met Mallory before this, do yourself a favour -- pick up her adventures, get to know her, enter her world, see it through her eyes.

Some of the alternate realities his characters (who are, naturally, himself, Chester and [picked up halfway] T.A.) go through are semi-rational, some are simply hilarious. I first read this book many years ago; i have never forgotten the class of earnest dragonettes learning the story of \\"Ethyl the Martyr and The Man In The Tin Suit\\", nor the sentence that contains three unjustified assumptions in as many words...<br />Their mutual friend Randall Garrett based his briliant wizard Sir Thomas Leseaux on T.A.Waters, and Kurland takes us through Garrett's universe on the trip, by the way.  He also plays a neat little trick with the inherent possibilities of alternate universe travel that i had never thought of nor encountered elsewhere, having to do with just how close adjacent alternate universes can be.<br />Wonderful book.  Read it.  Read it AFTER \\"The Butterfly Kid\\", if you can (though \\"Kid\\" seems to be out of print again) and try to read \\"Probability Pad\\" afterward.<br />(Sadly, Chester and T.A. have, in Kinky Friedman's evocative phrase, stepped on a rainbow, and we can expect no new books from them; Kurland, however, seems to be still active, with Holmesiana -- including editing a collection of original Holmesian pastiches -- and at least two 1930s-set mysteries.  Find anything he has written -- particularly \\"Transmission Error\\" and \\"Pluribus\\" and read them; i doubt that you will be disappointed.  A warning, however -- virtually everything he writes reads like the first volume of a series you'd enjoy... but he never seems to write the sequels.)d T.A. have, in Kinky Friedman's evocative phrase, stepped on a rainbow, and we can expect no new books from them; Kurland, however, seems to be still active, with Holmesiana -- including editing a collection of original Holmesian pastiches -- and at least two 1930s-set mysteries.

(if nothing else, there is nothing to equal the brillint &quot;Gashleycrumb Tinies&quot; nor &quot;The Unstrung Harp&quot;), the first Gorey omnibus volume, if only because the very best was skimmed off for that volume, this is still very high class whimsey indeed.<br />Like Gahan Wilson (q.v), Gorey looks at the world in a slightly skewed manner; much of his work consists of showing or telling us something that sounds perfectly rational but does not, in fact, quite compute, leaving our own minds to struggle with the cognitive dissonance he creates.<br />Probably my favourite bit in this collection is &quot;The Gilded Bat&quot;, which is a sadly perceptive story of perception and reality in the life of a prima ballerina -- even after litle Maudy Splaytoe has progressed to being enigmatic star Miriella Splatova, her life is still pretty much the same as it always was, a round of rehearsal, performance and boredom.  (In a wonderful example of something or other, there was a ballet based on this work; i have never seen it, but heard an interview on PBS with the choreographer, who had had to create excerpts from three OTHER, fictitious, ballets referred to in the text...)<br />The two versions of &quot;The Chinese Obelisks&quot; present us with an opportunity to see the author's mind at work, comparing sketch and draft of text to the finished work.<br />The only reason not to immediately purchase this work would be if you could only afford one of them and hadn't already got the previous volume.  If you DO already have &quot;Amphigorey&quot;, then you absolutely must have this collection to go with it.	2003-04-14

I never really felt as if i were reading descriptions of characters and situations that put me in mind of Hammer's Slammers or other Drake creations.<br />That said, David Drake's interest in history has clearly shaped these books; i'm fairly sure that the basic plot is derived from events and actions from late Roman ages.  Although the period is not one i am particularly familiar with, it would not surprise me to learn that the protagonist is inspired by Belisarius.<br />Another aspect that seems more Stirling than Drake is tghe manner in which the campaigns and battles that make up the majority of the sotry are handled; again, more a matter of perception of style than of definite evidence.  I am well-acquainted with he work of both, and that's the feeling i get.<br />As to the story (stories) itself, while not the most wonderful military sf i've ever read, there was enough of interest to keep me going, pushing along to see what was going to happen.  On the other hand, if i was encountering the series for the first time in individual book form, i doubt that i would get past the first volume.  Too much shooting, not enough substance.<br />The setup and mechanics of the stories are interesting -- i particularly like the ocncept of huge dogs replacing horses (though i doubt that they'd be as much like real dogs physically as they are protrayed, the square-cube law being what it is), and i like the way that the implications of this are worked out.<br />The mix of primitive and advanced (and Extremely Advanced) technology employed makes for interesting logistic considerations (&quot;Amateurs study tactics.  Professionals study logistics.&quot;) and action sequences.<br />The political maneuvering -- the most Drake-like parts of the story, to my taste -- is interesting, but too superficially-presented.<br />All in all, a good solid read for those who like Drake, Stirling or military SF in general, but not one i would advise running out and spending the rent money on.he implications of this are worked out.<br />The mix of primitive and advanced (and Extremely Advanced) technology employed makes for interesting logistic considerations (&quot;Amateurs study tactics.

(\\"Path of the Fury\\" (q.v.), from the same period, is, i think a better book, but \\"Moon\\" is excellent.)<br />We grew up on a diet of classic SF that has certainly shaped David's writing -- perticularly, in reading this book, i am reminded that we had access to the complete works of Edward E. (\\"Doc\\") Smith.  \\"Doc\\" would begin with a relatively basic premise (Dick Seaton discovers a way to produce all sorts of energy from ordinary copper; the Arisians and the Eddoreans work to thwart each other in shaping the Universe), and then, from book to book, both the super-scientific wonders and the stakes would grow and grow.  It is in the \\"Dahak\\" books that this influence on David most clearly shows, with entire moons used as weapons, ships the size of small planets, huge orbiting space defence fortresses, entire mountains resculpted to provide weapons mounts and weapons so powerful that a single bomb can destroy an entire world<br />David's opening premise here, that the Earth's Moon... isn't, so to speak, is grandiose enough, and would serve as the basis for an excellent novel without much added material... but it's just the beginning.<br />From the moment when astronaut Colin MacIntyre's spacecraft is snatched over Luna's Farsideby \\"impossible\\" means and he is conveyed into what appears to be a huge complex of caverns inside the Moon, the action begins accelerating and doesn't stop, as we learn that much of what we \\"know\\" of our world, our ancestors and our history is either false or the result of the conflicts of hidden forces of which we know nothing.<br />And then we discover that those forces are merely the result of panic reactions to the REAL coming menace.  And the race is on.<br />As in Smith, the stakes and the action constantly escalate; at one point the entire Earth is essentially one huge incredibly-armed fortress, energised by a powersource which may well break its controls and ravage the planet almost as badly as the attackers whose coming has necessitated it.<br />At the same time that Colin and his cohorts are fighting off the menace of the Achu'ultan, they are struggling to rebuild a huge stellar Empire which apprantly perished mysteriously, leaving hardware and technology behind, but no living worlds.<br />Much of David's strength as a writer lies in the sweeping concepts of his works; a lot also is the fact that his characters (while not necessarily \\"real\\") are fun to know, and do it is here -- particularly the character of Dahak, the computer controlling the huge warship of the same name who, over many thousands of years, has gradually become self-aware, and is definitely a \\"character\\".<br />Book One -- \\"Mutineers' Moon\\" -- chronicles Dahak and Colin's first meeting, as a result of which Colin finds himself in command of the huge ship and (nominally) Imperial Governor of Earth (which, of course, has no inkling that the Empire exists, much less than an Imperial Governor has just been appointed).  Warned of the menace of the oncoming Achu'ultanii, Colin has to organise Earth's defence -- but first he has to defeat the leaders of the ancient mutiny that sets the whole story in motion.<br />\\"The Armegeddon Inheritance\\" is the story of Colin's further adventures and of the beginnings of the rebuilding of the ancient Imperium, as Colin accidentally grants himself a rather large promotion.<br />\\"Heirs of Empire\\" jumps tenty or so years forward from the end of \\"Inheritance\\", to a time when Colin and Jiltanith's son and daughter and a couple of their friends suddenly find themselves stranded on a backward world where change or advance is literally heresy -- burn-at-the-stake type heresy -- and where the enclave of Imperial Technology they need to reach to get themselves rescued is the Sanctum Sanctorum of the oppressive religion.<br />Meanwhile, back on Earth and Birhat, a truly nastyplot is going forth, which Colin and friends have to discover and thwart, with the aid of some of the more endearing enhanced dogs written in a while. (Tinkerbell, the Labraweiler -- or is that Rottador -- who is the mother of the first of the superdogs, seems to be based on a huge lovely and loving dog of David's.)<br />Now if he'd just write a fourth or even a fifth...y plot is going forth, which Colin and friends have to discover and thwart, with the aid of some of the more endearing enhanced dogs written in a while.

US	50835237	RGOJC8YVFHUJS	0425189031	810324253	Portrait in Death	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Varying the Formula	Roarke doesn't own the scene of the crime! I think that that may be a first for this series.<br />Likewise, Roarke's part in the investigation is much smaller than usual, as he spends the first two-thirds of the book either tending to his major-domo/surrogate father, Summerset, after he is injured tripping on the cat on the stairs, or investigating surprise revelations about his own heritage in Dublin.<br />With Roarke mostly out of the way, Roberts concentrates strongly on Dallas and Peabody's investigation of the killings; other regulars like McNabb, Feeney, Nadine Furst and Dr Mira make only peripheral (though fairly important) appearances.<br />Just as an earlier volume (Seduction in Death) seemed to take a major part of its inspiration from the Leopold/Loeb murders that also inspired Hitchcok's \\"Rope\\", this volume is, once all is revealed, somewhat reminiscent of both \\"Psycho\\" and \\"Red Dragon\\".<br />What Roarke discovers in Dublin and County Clare, after revelations from a social worker at the refuge for abused women and children he is funding, may well change the future course of the series. (And, here, there is an interesting resonance with the [sadly] now defunct, often brilliant DC comic \\"Hitman\\", in which anti-hero professional killer Tommy Monaghan makes a similar journey to discover similar history... but with widely differing results.)<br />Someone is killing brilliant and beautiful young people, photographing them and sending the imagery to Nadine Furst at Channel 75; apparently the killer seems to believe that somehow he will, through his post-mortem photos of the victims in life-like poses, capture what he calls their \\"light\\" and, perhaps, become immortal if he can capture enough such \\"light\\".<br />As usual, Dallas takes these attacks on the innocent and defenseless as a personal affront, and doggedly tracks down the killer.<br />Also as usual, while the form of the books is police-procedural stories set in a science-fictional milieu, there are lapses in logic as the story advances by coincidence and intuition. ((This does NOT make it a bad story as such, just one in which the reader doesn't have much chance of solving it ahead of the protagonist.)) As often in this series, the identity of the killer sort of comes out of left field, though when revealed, both plausibility and consistency are there.<br />One thing that sometimes causes me to drop the rating of books in this series by a star or so from where i usually would rate them based on the story alone, is the background.<br />Dallas and Roarke and Co are operating in the New York City of 2059. The history of now till then as she Roberts has sketched it in, involving something called the \\"Urban Wars\\", is acceptably plausible (and conveniently vague); but the world that they live in bothers me.<br />Most specifically, in the year 2059 (which is, after all, only fifty-six years in our future), Roberts would have us believe that interstellar -- not interplanetary but interSTELLAR -- travel has become so common that there are luxury resorts on the worlds of other stars, and that faster-than-light interplanetary/interstellar communications not only exist but are apparently at about the level that long-distance phone calls were, forty or so years ago -- expensive, but not particularly so.<br />I don't believe it. And, while i am willing to perform that trick called \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" up to a point, i am sometimes jarred while reading these books (and others, more overtly pitched as \\"science fiction\\", for that matter) by a necessity to hang my disbelief by the neck until dead.<br />But, that said, this is a worthy entry in a series that consistently delivers solid reading enjoyment, good if not particularly plausible cop action, the occasional little gruesome shiver, and plenty of enjoyable interaction between the members of a well-established and solidly-constructed cast.<br />And more than usual of Dallas and Summerset's running feud, and of theirjoint love of and concern for Roarke.<br />(Which reminds me, i suspect that one of the characters in this book may well become a new semi-regular in the series.)<br />There's no doubt that Pierce Brosnan would make a wonderful Roarke, if anyone were making a film.

I explained the Bolonium Hypothesis to her; and, as i expected (based on previous Dallas/Roarke mysteries), while i didn't believe for a moment that such a thing could happen, if i accepted that it could, i was in for a pretty good romance/police procedural novel as Dallas and company mobilised to catch the Bad Guys.<br />Said Bad Guys are a group of vigilante-types who are out to bring their own brand of \\"justice\\" to child-predators who cannot be touched by the law; as is often the case in plots of this type, the initial public reaction to their actions and manifestos is guardedly favourable -- after all, they're only attacking nasty child-molestors.<br />But Dallas and her people are aware that people who deal extra-legal \\"justice\\" to one class of offendor are likely to expand their attentiosn to others.  And not everyone agrees as to just who ought to die for his \\"crimes\\".  A child-molestor?  Quite possibly.  A dealer in nasty drugs? Maybe.  A jay-walker. perhaps?<br />As usual, Robb delivers the goods, specially in the secondary characters with which this series is so rich.  Peabody and McNabb have particularly strong (and uncharacteristic, but completely in-character) roles to play, and Mavis has a Startling Announcement.<br />While you can start the series with this volume (or any other), i really think you'll have more fun if you start with the first and read them in order.olume (or any other), i really think you'll have more fun if you start with the first and read them in order.	2002-10-06

Theo wanders the country, trying to get a grip on how he feels about the thought of Mickle, the street urchin he fell in love with in \\"Westmark\\" becoming Queen... with himself intended as Prince Consort.<br />When the invasion begins, Mickle finds herself forced to become a military commander, and Theo finds himself among Florian's \\"children\\" again, fighting the Regians as an irregular, eventually rising to the rank of colonel among Florian's forces.<br />And Alexamder takes the chance -- without seeming preachy or heavy-handed -- to present us with just a bit (PG13 rating or so) of the horror of war and what it does to even good people.<br />Because \\"Colonel Kestrel\\", the brilliant and ruthless revolutionary/guerrilla leader is, also, the gentle Theo, who has never believed in violence as a solution to anything.<br />Someone has said, more or less, that Alexander is here presenting a parable on the uses and effects of violence, in causes good and not-so-good.  He proposes (by example) the question \\"When -- if ever -- is violence justified in a 'good cause'?\\", and proceeds to show us (again by example) the answers to that question arrived at by various people of greater or lesser good-will.<br />And then he hands the reader an even hotter potato to examine than that -- he asks us to consider the after-effects of violence (even \\"in a good cause\\") on the people who have found themselves forced into it.<br />And it hurts -- in a good way -- to see what some people must give up so that others may still have it.<br />(David Drake presents a much more violent -- and most *definitely* adult -- look at much the same questions in his military SF novel \\"Redliners\\".)<br />In the end, everyone is forced to compromise somewhat, and all *appears* to be well.<br />On the other hand, this *is* the second olume of a trilogy.give up so that others may still have it.<br />(David Drake presents a much more violent -- and most *definitely* adult -- look at much the same questions in his military SF novel \\"Redliners\\".)<br />In the end, everyone is forced to compromise somewhat, and all *appears* to be well.<br />On the other hand, this *is* the second olume of a trilogy.	2002-07-21

As with his wonderful \\"Prydain\\" books, in this trilogy (the present book, followed by \\"The Kestrel\\" and \\"The Beggar Queen\\") Alexander sets out to entertain us, and if he can enlighten us or provoke us to ponder important questions of responsibility and maturity along the ride, so much the better.<br />But the entertainment, as always with Alexander, comes first.<br />Theo, a \\"printer's devil\\", naively fails to consider how new regulations set forth by the Chief Minister of Westmark will affect him when, his master being out, he accepts a commission to print handbills for Count Las Bombas (a charming scalawag in the tradition of Fflewdur Fflam, but even more broadly drawn and a rogue to boot).<br />As quickly as the reader can guess that this might be a Bad Idea, troops have smashed up the shop, and Theo is on the run, along with Las Bombas and Musket the Demon Coachman (am alarmingly competent dwarf who spends most of his life getting Las Bombas out of trouble).<br />Things are Not Good in Westmark -- the King is terribly ill, the Crown Princess has vanished, and Chief Minister Cabbarus is gaining more and more control and becoming more and more authoritarian.<br />In the course of his adventures in this book, Theo will meet Florian, a personally gentle and sardonic but politically ruthless intellectual who seeks to put his theories into practise as he leads his \\"children\\" to establish an egalitarian Republic.<br />Also along for the trip is the beggar girl Mickle, who joins Theo, Las Bombas and Musket as they travel the countryside as a medicine show, and with whom Theo discovers he is falling in love before he even realises that love is what he is falling into.<br />As always, Alexander puts his young hero on the spot; he must decide what is \\"right\\" and do it, even though there appear to be more than one possible courses that appear \\"right\\".  Prop up the Monarchy?  Join Florian's Republicans? Just hide his head and hope It All Goes Away?<br />By the end of the book, it appears that all is set right, the evil Chief Minister banished and Theo and Mickle headed for Happy Ever After.<br />Of course, this is the first book of a trilogy...k, it appears that all is set right, the evil Chief Minister banished and Theo and Mickle headed for Happy Ever After.<br />Of course, this is the first book of a trilogy...	2002-07-21

In this wonderful look at a dark and fascinating period in Anglo-Scottish history, Fraser brings the same quirky attitude and deep appreciation of man's inherent rascality that make the \\"Flashman\\" books and his novel \\"Mr American\\" (q.v.) so iminently readable to the explication of the complex and violent history of the Border reivers.<br />Beginning with a Foreword that, among other things, describes the jolt he got watching Richard Nixon's Inauguration on television, when he saw Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and Billy Graham standing together on the platform, he explains, in typical fashion, that Johnson, Nixon and Graham are all names that figured strongly in the reiving years, and thateach, as well, wore faces that might well still be seen in the Border country today.<br />He delves into the history of Hadrian's Wall (\\"Any Englishman can tell you why it was built -- 'To keep the Scots out!'\\"), and speculates how Anglo-Scottish history might have been changed were the Wall a few milse north or south.<br />And then he dives off into the history of the Border and the Reivers.<br />This is *not* a standard, dry history text, laying everything out in a straight line,with dates and battles to memorise and all the juice sucked out of it.<br />No, Fraser skips around; first giving us an outline of the whole period, he then, in subsequent chapters, cover different aspects of the history in depth, and not necessarily chronologically.<br />He gives us fascinating details, such as why the spiral stairs in the watch towers built by the Kerr family tended to spiral anti-clockwise instead of the usual clockwise, in the process defining and explaining the origin of the term \\"correy fisted\\".<br />He writes of the great feuds among the reiving families, many of whom were to be found on both sides of the Border, of the practise of blackmail (somewhat different than the meaning the term has today) and in what manner one might legally pursue raiders back across the Border to attempt to retrieve one's property.<br />Explaining the administrative setup of the Border, he describes the careers and personalities of several of the more prominent Border Wardens, lawmen assigned by both England and Scotland to keep the peace, but never given the budgets or forces they needed.<br />He introduces us to several of the prominent reivers, including some of Sir Walter Scott's ancestors, and recounts their deeds.<br />He analyses the economy of the Border and the reiving system, as well as anyone can, at this remove and from extant records, and shows howthis all affected the overall history ofAnglo-Scottish relations.<br />And, for good measure, he includes the truly \\"Monition of Cursing\\" issued by the Archbishop of Glasgow against the reivers, a masterful piece of vituperation that runs four or more full pages depending on the edition.<br />Not a history text in the classic sense, not a novel, because it's all true, Fraser has presented the reader with a corking good reading experience that opens the window on another time and place whose influences still reverberate in the world today.<br />((About the spelling of Eliot... or Ellet ... or Eliott...: The family seemed to not mind how their name was spelt -- Fraser lists a large number of variant spellings with various permutations of \\"L\\"s and \\"T\\"s.

I barely managed to keep track of the principals, and probably lost a number of plot details because of not grasping character interactions properly. (I generally like Hambly's books better when they feature smaller casts.)<br />I must also agree that i could have done with more of January's family (though his placee sister is featured in a rather tense little side-plot) and, perhaps, more of Rose -- although i suspect that \\"more of Rose\\" is going to be rather prominent in some future volume.<br />I especially would have enjoyed more of Abishag Shaw, the Colombo-esque \\"American\\" police officer with whom Ben has a working relationship based on mutual respect and trust that's about as close to true friendship as a free man of color and a white man would be able to come in the New Orleans of the mid-nineteenth century.  ((Ben's friendship with his Irish fellow-musician is a special case...))<br />And i'd certainly welcome more of Marie Laveau...<br />That all being said, i still enjoyed the book quite a bit -- even if i lost track of the details of the mystery part of the plot -- because Hambly, as always, spins a great story of hope and despair, love and hate, life and death and tears and laughter.<br />While this is not the volume i'd choose to hand to someone who hadn't read any of the previous books -- i'd definitely recommend beginning with \\"A Free Man of COlor\\", the first -- and while i found it the most difficult of the series so far, i would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone who asked me if they ought read it.<br />((Incidentally, if you have read this book or any of the previous books in this series and enjoyed them, but have not tried her fantasies, i definitely recommend them -- particularly my favourite, the unfortunately out-of-print \\"Stranger at the Wedding\\", which straight-facedly combines the best aspects of a Georgette Heyer romantic farce with a mildly gruesome horror plot.))urite, the unfortunately out-of-print \\"Stranger at the Wedding\\", which straight-facedly combines the best aspects of a Georgette Heyer romantic farce with a mildly gruesome horror plot.))	2002-03-31

He gave me a little background, and it sounded interesting.<br />Thus, when i got a chance to read \\"On Basislisk Station\\", i was quite eager, and, i am happy to say, i was not disappointed.<br />OBS has, for me, pretty much all of the strengths (and they are many) or Dave's best writing, and, unfortunately, indications of some of the weaknesses (minor though they may be) to come.<br />Strengths -- he does very well at portraying Good Officers who Lead By Example and who can see the best way to use their ships and the personnel assigned under them, no matter how ill-suited to the task at hand they may appear to be, or how overwhelmed by opposing forces.<br />Honor's excellent use of the bastard weapon system inflicted upon her by misguided theorists is an example of such -- even if it does get her sent to the Manticoran equivalent of a footbeat in Yonkers.<br />He has a strength in portraying Bad Guys -- many of whom turn out to be pretty much just ordinary joes doing their best for *their* side, just as Honor is doing her best for hers.<br />Unfortunately, he also has a tendency to introduce Villains from time to time -- genuine, mustache-twirling, sneering, scenery-chewing mellerdrammer tie-Little-Nell-to-the-tracks Oilcan Harry-syle villians (sic).  And they just *grate* on me.  The only \\"good\\" thing about the introduction of Pavel Young here is that it's pretty obvious he's eventually going to Get His.

It appears as if they are carrying \\"dead ment tall no tales\\" to its logical extreme -- but even early on there are indications it may be even more than that.<br />One shuttle-load of such heavily armed and murderous raiders is just unlucky enough that, on a backwater planet their fleet is raiding, they happen to hit the farm that is the home of Alicia de Vries, retired Imperial Marine Drop Commando.  And said lady, who had been out hunting a Very Large native predator on the far range, returns in time to find her entire family wiped out and the Bad Guys still on the ground.<br />With nothing to live for, the heavily-augmented Alicia proceeds to become the sort of berserk that is the worst nightmare of any fighting man -- beyond pain, able to shrug off even normally-fatal wounds, totally unconcerned about herself, and determined to have revenge before she dies herself.<br />And, it is as she lies dying herself, having taken revenge on all of the killers of her family, that David introduces the twist that makes this book unlike virtually any other military SF novel you have read or will ever read, in the person of a character who, in consort with Alicia and one other, will raise them all to higher and higher levels of prowess, to the point where Alicia is not only possibly the greatest individual warrior who has ever lived, but even more -- an implacable, unswerving personification of vengeance who terrifies even herself.<br />In the person(s) of Alicia and her two partners, who collectively may be said to be the Fury of the title, David has introduced a rather daring twist on military SF that, at the least, challenges the underlying assumptions of a mechanistic Universe that are basic to so much of the genre; has bent if not broken the rules and succeeded brilliantly in producing an original and Very Satisfying adventure.<br />Powerful as they are, Alicia & Co still face many difficult if not deadly challenges -- both from the Bad Guys and from well-meaning but non-comprehending Good Guys -- that the book is hardly a boring walkover, even for them, and the action is hot and heavy enough for even the most jaded military SF fan's taste.<br />His best so far.at the least, challenges the underlying assumptions of a mechanistic Universe that are basic to so much of the genre; has bent if not broken the rules and succeeded brilliantly in producing an original and Very Satisfying adventure.<br />Powerful as they are, Alicia & Co still face many difficult if not deadly challenges -- both from the Bad Guys and from well-meaning but non-comprehending Good Guys -- that the book is hardly a boring walkover, even for them, and the action is hot and heavy enough for even the most jaded military SF fan's taste.<br />His best so far.	2002-03-19

Scudder's return, while welcome, isn't *quite* the Scudder we've known before.<br />As has been pointed out, he is 62, and slowing down a bit physically, so it seems only fair that nobody tries to personally punch his ticket to any extent in this volume.<br />As is often the case in a Scudder novel, indirection is the underlying driving force here, to the extent that, even though Scudder and TJ -- TJ is moving steadily upward toward the status of a full partner, it looks like -- solve the killings, at the end of the story, they are still not *quite* certain that everything is over and all the ends are tied up.<br />Other reviewers have objected to the italicised sections featuring the killer's thoughts and plans, but i believe that they *do* advance and enlarge the plot, and are definitely necessary. This book runs on a formula that Ed McBain has pretty well worked out in the 87th Precinct's sporadic encounters with the Master Criminal they know only as \\"the deaf man\\".  When the story involves this sort of cat and mouse game between antagonist and protagonist, the reader, at least, must have at least some inkling of what the \\"cat\\" is thinking, or else the action of the story becomes a series of random events, not shaped to any visual end, as \\"mouse\\" after \\"mouse\\" is swept from the board.<br />On the other hand, it is possible to let the reader see too much of what the antagonist is thinking/planning, thus vitiating the suspense, but Block, like McBain, has a firm enough grasp on his narrative as to not go that way.<br />And this one is a spooky one to share the thoughts of; a somewhat unusual serial killer, he is so cheerily analytical about his own actions, so calm and precise in making his plans and setting them in motion that i was struck by the notion that if the Joker were a bit less flamboyant (both physically and personal-style-wise) the villain of this book would resemble him.<br />Scudder's untangling of the layer upon layer of deception came only a bit less quickly than mine, in some areas, and rather more quickly when i occasionally found myself almost at a standstill.<br />One thing that i did wonder at is that Scudder lets things progress rather beyond the point where, in my opinion, he ought to be arranging a little protection for people -- there's at least one point in here where, if Scudder were Spenser, Hawk and Vinnie Morris would be taking surveillance/protection shifts alternating with Belson and Quirk, and Scudder doesn't see it that way.<br />Eventually, seeing a real threat to one character who does not seem to be receiving requested police protection, Scudder enlists Mick Ballou's aid.<br />As i said, though they basically solve the specific cases/killings, Scudder, TJ and friends are a bit slow on some things, setting up the possibility of repercussions in future books.<br />Unusually for the series so far, Scudder's ex-wife and estranged sons, ritually referred to in every most if not all of the previous volumes but seldom if ever actually seen, here appear as actual characters with actual lives and problems that (at least peripherally) Scudder finds himself drawn into.  Already, i think, we have seen more of them in this one volume than we have in all the seventeen preceding books combined.  It will be interesting to see if Block continues to enlarge upon this connection to Scudder's former life as the series moves forward.s quickly than mine, in some areas, and rather more quickly when i occasionally found myself almost at a standstill.<br />One thing that i did wonder at is that Scudder lets things progress rather beyond the point where, in my opinion, he ought to be arranging a little protection for people -- there's at least one point in here where, if Scudder were Spenser, Hawk and Vinnie Morris would be taking surveillance/protection shifts alternating with Belson and Quirk, and Scudder doesn't see it that way.<br />Eventually, seeing a real threat to one character who does not seem to be receiving requested police protection, Scudder enlists Mick Ballou's aid.<br />As i said, though they basically solve the specific cases/killings, Scudder, TJ and friends are a bit slow on some things, setting up the possibility of repercussions in future books.<br />Unusually for the series so far, Scudder's ex-wife and estranged sons, ritually referred to in every most if not all of the previous volumes but seldom if ever actually seen, here appear as actual characters with actual lives and problems that (at least peripherally) Scudder finds himself drawn into.

The Freedom Party, at the beginning a tiny splinter group, is an organisation possibly more scary to the early-21st-century reader than it is to the early-20th-century characters (though it certainly scares enough of them, to be sure).  After all, our own history was shaped by a tiny splinter party that began its existence meeting in the backs of bars in Bavaria...<br />As in our universe, there is a horrible period of inflation/depression, with the printing presses unable to keep up with the demand, with postage stamps and paper money literally bearing amounts in the billions of dollars. Some may find this sort of hyper-inflation hard to believe, but, somewhere, i have actual real-world have multi-million-mark (and, i think, billion-mark) German ordinary postage stamps from the period between the Wars.  But, as Turtledove shows us, even that sort of horrid times brings opportunities (even honest ones) for those who have open eyes and a quick grasp of a situation.<br />Up in the Republic of Quebec, Lucien Gaultier and his family --including his Yankee son-in-law, a doctor -- reap the beginnings of returning peace and prosperity, but another Canadian farmer resumes his bombing career in an attempt to exact more vengeance for the firing-squad death of his son, early in the US occupation.<br />George Armstrong Custer, his single solution to any military situation (charge headlong with everything you have) having paid off when using \\"barrels\\" (tanks) against infantry and cavalry, is a national hero.  Which, with five billion Confederate dollars, will buy you a cup of coffee.  Or perhaps not, if you have sufficient enemies in the War Department and the Executive Mansion.

The article included a rather fractured but hilarious plot-summary of a book entitled \\"Sylvester, or, the Wicked Uncle.\\"  I, being bored, checked the Navy Exchange's book racks and discovered a Hayer book entitled \\"The Talisman Ring\\", read it, and was hooked. ((It was some years later before i found a copy of \\"Sylvester\\", which proved to be even more gloriously silly and complex in plot than the article i had read had implied...))<br />Anyway, having read every Regency or Georgian romance and all of the historical novels the late Ms Heyer published (her mysteries are a different and, i'm afraind, unfathomable, thing entirely), i came to the conclusion that she basically wrote two types of story:  Romps and Sweets, as i called them.<br />Sweets were iminently readable, consisting primarily of relatively lowkey action and devastatingly-drawn observations of society and drawing room wit/comedy of manners writing.<br />Romps had the comedy of manner, but usually also featured wilder elements, such as gender swaps between brother and sister in order to hide in plain sight, military officers taking over the opeation of a country tollgate on a whim to discover where the missing gatekeeper is, abductions of various sorts for various purposes, smuggling and various other nafarious activities, a young woman married to a man she'd never seen till fifteen minutes before and thenm widowed less than an hour afterward, and murders, duels and fisticuffs of various and sundry sorts.  And love stories.<br />So what, you ask, does that have to do with a review of a Kasey Michaels novel?  Just that this is a Regency Romp that is *almost* as good as one of Heyer's.<br />And *almost* as good as Georgette Heyer is readable indeed.<br />There are, in fact, familiar elements of Heyeresque plot scattered througout this book -- and at least one neat little bit of dialog that my wife and i are both sure is a tongue-in-cheek reference to Heyer's \\"These Old Shades\\", possibly the best of her romps.<br />Brady James, a typical Heyeresque heroic non-pareil, is attacked and thrown, weighted, into the Thames to drown, barely escaping with his life.<br />Arranging with friends to fake his own funeral, he retreats to his country house to recuperate and to plot the discovery and punishment of whoever tried to do him in.<br />He suspects that the attack may have something to do with his enquiries into the background of a Miss Regina Bliss, a young lady apparently incapable of telling the truth when an outrageous lie will do better who was rescued from the streets by friends of his in a previous book.<br />As he recuperates, he and Miss Bliss work out a scheme in which he will be his own foppish distant cousin, newly returned from France with his inheritance of Brady's title and estates and she will be his ward.  Together, they will discover his own attackers; and Miss Bliss, who has an agenda of her own, will also look for revenge on old enemies of her own whom Brady knows nothing of.<br />And, as anyone can predict, though the path of True Love will hardly run smooth, it will happen.<br />Lots of fun, well worth the attention of anyone who likes Heyer and has run out of her books.* as good as Georgette Heyer is readable indeed.<br />There are, in fact, familiar elements of Heyeresque plot scattered througout this book -- and at least one neat little bit of dialog that my wife and i are both sure is a tongue-in-cheek reference to Heyer's \\"These Old Shades\\", possibly the best of her romps. <br />Brady James, a typical Heyeresque heroic non-pareil, is attacked and thrown, weighted, into the Thames to drown, barely escaping with his life.<br />Arranging with friends to fake his own funeral, he retreats to his country house to recuperate and to plot the discovery and punishment of whoever tried to do him in.<br />He suspects that the attack may have something to do with his enquiries into the background of a Miss Regina Bliss, a young lady apparently incapable of telling the truth when an outrageous lie will do better who was rescued from the streets by friends of his in a previous book.<br />As he recuperates, he and Miss Bliss work out a scheme in which he will be his own foppish distant cousin, newly returned from France with his inheritance of Brady's title and estates and she will be his ward.

I've told him so in person, at least once.<br />This book was out of print for a while -- alegedly because the sort of Trekkie Getalifes so perfectly skewered in that &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; skit with Shatner rose up in arms and demanded to know how anyone dared actually make funny k\jokes with ST characters.<br />There's an episode of the British teevee series &quot;The Goodies&quot; in which the Goodies are on trial for violating the sacred boredom of a Welsh folk music festival.  &quot;And what did they do?&quot; demands the druid (played by former &quot;Dr Who&quot; Jon Pertwee). &quot;They set about to *entertain* us!&quot;<br />Well, &quot;Mike&quot; Ford set about to entertain us, succeeded brilliantly (if you're not a humourless stuffed shirt) and he hasn't written another &quot;Star Trek&quot; novel to this day.<br />There may be a connection.  Predictable mediocrity is apparently preferable in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise universe to lightning in a bottle brilliance that requires thinking outside the box.<br />That said, writing a musical novel is rather a startling concept -- though several of the songs are excellent, particularly &quot;In Monochrome&quot;, the tribute to film noir in the sequence in which Uhura and a Klingon junior officer (and fellow film buff) find themselves in a noirish predicament.<br />This book also contains what may be the shortest &quot;Dr Who&quot; reference in fiction -- watch for the Brigadier and the Sergeant-Major.<br />And one of the GREAT lines -- i can hear it in my mind -- *and* i can perfectly visualise precisely what happens immediately afterward -- &quot;Will *someone* please give the Captain a pie?&quot;<br />((Incidentally -- should anyone question my credentials as a reviewer of &quot;Star Trek&quot; material -- i was at the World Science Fiction Convention at which &quot;Star Trek&quot; was previewed before it went on the air.

I began reading these books at my wife's suggestion; while the earlier volumes were a bit weak, i found enough to continue, and now look forward to each new entry in the series.<br />Dallas and Roarke and company are strong and interesting -- if somewhat larger than life -- characters, who pull the reader into their lives and adventures, a definite plus for a series.<br />The plausibility of the police action portion of the stories continues to improve; that is, while not particularly like real-world police procedures, it still rings true enough for the purposes of the story.<br />The futuristic setting still fails to convince me, but it's certainly at least as self-consistent and plausible as the future we see in &quot;Star Trek&quot;.<br />The romance elements... well, they're there.  I never cease to be amused by the fact that mainstream, respectable romance novels of today often feature language and descriptions rather stronger than were common in under-the-counter pornography when i was in my teens, forty years ago.<br />As usual, Dallas's byplay with her assistant, Officer Peabody, and Peabody and computer cop McNabb's on-again/off-again hot romance provide elements of broad humour and Roarke continues to own virtually everything in sight. (I'm getting a bit tired of that gag, actually.)<br />Plotwise, it's one of the tighter and more complex to date; pretty obviously inspired by the real-life Leopold/Loeb killings that also inspired Hitchcock's &quot;Rope&quot;, but giving a couple of nasty little extra twists of the type that are this series's stock in trade.<br />The initial crime(s) that bring Dallas into the story involve the use of some rather nasty date-rape drugs in the seduction and deaths of young women in kinkily-romantic settings; bed strewn with rose petals, fine wines, lovely dinners... and death.<br />As Dallas and Peabody probe the case, it becomes evident that this is something beyond &quot;merely&quot; a rapist/murderer... something nastier and sicker and dirtier.<br />And Dallas offers herself as bait for the monster...<br />If you've read earlier books in the series and enjoyed it, then you'll want to read this one as well.  If you haven't read any of them, you could either go back to the beginning of the series, or you could, i'd say, easily begin with this or any other of the earlier ones that sounds interesting. Unlike some series, while the characters and setting have been steadily developing in interest and complexity, this is not a series that one has to read from the very first in order to properly appreciate them.<br />I would love to see a decent film or TV series made from this series; having caught an early &quot;Remington Steele&quot; the other day, i'd love to see Pierce Brosnan as Roarke.and sicker and dirtier.<br />And Dallas offers herself as bait for the monster...<br />If you've read earlier books in the series and enjoyed it, then you'll want to read this one as well.

(For many years, &quot;World's FInest&quot;'s lead story every month was a Batman/Superman team-up, in an era when hero's team-ups were not common)<br />Excellent adaptation of the original; however, not a slavish one -- plays the rivalry between Batman/Bruce and Superman/Clark for Lois Lane's affections a little more broadly (the visual differences between the animated and the comic versions of the scene in which Clark calls at Lois's apartment and Bruce is already there are Significant).<br />Harley Quinn's running feud with Luthor's bodyguard/chauffeur, Mercy, is one of the high points.<br />While it doesn't bring much new, it's a good counterpoint to the film it adapts in giving alternate, slightly more &quot;adult&quot; views on some things -- if you have one, you really need the other.	2001-08-23

I recall finding &quot;Mr Perfect&quot; enjoyable but a bit annoying, though the specifics are long gone from my menory.<br />&quot;Open Season&quot; mixes disparate elements as it tells a crossover mystery/romance story -- *extremely* disparate elements, as the story of small-town librarian Daisy Minor's midlife crisis and consequent pursuit of romance (which is mostly played broadly for humour) contrasts strongly with the second story element, the running (by a classic &quot;above suspicion&quot; type character) of an international white-slave ring in her small Alabama hometown.<br />The dark elements are not enough to drag the romance story down from its basic frothy aims, but certainly add an element of mild suspense.  ((I mean, if we believe Linda Hamilton is going to beat the Terminator in the end, no matter how bad it looks, we have to have faith Daisy and her new beau can outsmart a bunch of crooks that only has about one competent member.))<br />Daisy's campaign to advertise her new lifestyle -- that is, available for romance -- is Very Funny Indeed, using as it does the way in which gossip and scandal flow in a small Southern town. (Having grown up in one such in South Carolina, i can attest to the feasibility of spreading rumours merely by shopping in the right places...)<br />The romance is one of those &quot;opposites attract, disdain-him-at-first&quot; things, but not to extremes because there is too much going on for too much of that to fit.<br />Daisy's visits to a local C&amp;W bar/dance hall are almost too long and detailed, for that matter, but are important tot he story and i wouldn't have missed the brawl -- and how it starts -- for the world.<br />The biggest surprise in the whole book are the last two pages, which contrast and complement the rest of the book.<br />((I must say, i am rather startled by the relatively-graphic sex scenes in some of today's romances; thirty-three years ago, when i was in the Navy, you had to go to sleezy little stores on side streets to find books with sexual sequences as graphic))i am rather startled by the relatively-graphic sex scenes in some of today's romances; thirty-three years ago, when i was in the Navy, you had to go to sleezy little stores on side streets to find books with sexual sequences as graphic))	2001-08-07

It's too well-constructed to give you any spoilers, and it's too twisty to do justice to that way anyway.<br />What i am going to say is that this is the first book in i-don't-know-when that i was literally unable to put down.  Once i got past a certain point, everything in my life went on hold until, a couple hours later, i emerged triumphantly at the end of the story.<br />Let me warn you *not* to expect the same sort of story Crais has been giving us so well with Elvis Cole and Joe Pike -- though there have been hints of darkness in the Pike character and in the most recent book (\\"L.A. Requiem\\"), the Cole mysteries are still pretty open, sunny stories.<br />Not this one.<br />This one is dark and closed in and twisty and it takes you down to where the worms and the bugs and the other dark things live and it shows 'em to you; Crais is working the edges of Ellroy country here, and it may be disturbing to some people (though i didn't find myself with the feeling that i'd been swimming in lukewarm slime that i usually have after reading Ellroy).<br />Carol Starkey, who is still trying to come to grips with having been dead for three minutes after a bomb she was working went off, is a sad, sick, brave cop who carries on because The Job is all that's left of her life.  \\"Mr Red\\", the serial bomber who hunts cops, identified by ATF as the maker of the bomb that kills an LA cop to begin the story, is one of the scariest characters i've encountered in a long time.  ATF Special Agent Pell, who works the case with Starkey, is almost as scary as Red.<br />And the world of explosives freaks and their computer interactions that we're shown is *really* scary, because they're *really* believable.<br />Judging by the preview for Crais's next book in the back of this paperback, he intends to continue this darker and heavier trend and to not return to Cole and Pike for a while, which is fine; after \\"L.A.Requiem\\", Pike and Cole need some time off.<br />If you can stand a somewhat dark and depressing setting, this is one ... good read that you ought to try.time off.<br />If you can stand a somewhat dark and depressing setting, this is one ... good read that you ought to try.	2001-07-23

There is an air of jokey humour that could, but (for me anyway) doesn't detract from the story.<br />[An example: other reviewers have mentioned the presence of (and assassination of) Richard Nixon as &quot;Tricky/Honest Dick&quot;, the used-car magnate in the story; the real punchline of that joke is when we are casually informed that the assassination was the work of a lone gunman firing form a nearby grassy knoll.]<br />I wonder whether that collaborator actually *was* Richard Dreyfuss (and i've just realised that i know someone who could tell me, if he will...), but that's not really important, what's inmportant is that the collaboration gives us a book that like Turtledove's other books in it meticulousness and attention to historical detail, but rather different in both structure and tone.<br />The story is rather basic, which is fine, as it's really a hook to hang the historical exposition on: Famous painting of the title is stolen while on exhibition in the Colonies.  Protagonist is local high-ranking cop who sets out to fetch it back.  This story is told smoothly and straightforwardly, remaining focussed on the protagonist and not jumping all over the map as the &quot;Worldwar&quot; and &quot;Great War&quot; books have tended to do.<br />But, for me, it's the incidentals that fill in the picture around the edges, as the famous painting is filled around the edges with historical figures including the painter himself -- the incidentals that tell us about this world.<br />The overall pace of life, for instance, is rather more leisurely than ours, and the preferred method of comfortable travel is by dirigible airship... i found it rather amusing that most, if not all, of the airships were named, and mostly bore the names of famous trains in our universe.  Cars are steamers (and trains still are) (Though i wonder about the limited number of aeroplanes in use, and, in fact, about the airships themselves -- steam has been found, in our universe, impractical for such applications.)<br />Most of the characters are pretty well stock caricatures, though often a bit more believable than the usual Turtledove character (or that may just be my imagination) with the exception of Colonel Tom Bushell, the protagonist, who is rather more fully drawn than the rest.  Hitchcock would have loved the convolutions of the trail Bushell and his adjutant follow and likewise would have loved the potentially-complex possible motives of several of the major characters.<br />All in all, well worth the read.ges, as the famous painting is filled around the edges with historical figures including the painter himself -- the incidentals that tell us about this world.<br />The overall pace of life, for instance, is rather more leisurely than ours, and the preferred method of comfortable travel is by dirigible airship... i found it rather amusing that most, if not all, of the airships were named, and mostly bore the names of famous trains in our universe.

The cheerful &quot;isn't-it-great-to-be-a-soldier&quot; song, &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot; derives from an older and rather darker tradition, songs with titles like &quot;Johnny We Hardly Knew Ye&quot; and &quot;My Son John&quot; -- bitter songs about young men who came home maimed.  But it's the cheerful, cleaned-up versions like &quot;...Marching Home&quot; that those whose interests wars advance want us to remember because, if too many remember &quot;Johnny We Hardly Knew Ye&quot;, the next war will be harder to start.<br />As Turtledove brings his alternate World War One to a close, we can already see the seeds of the next war being sown, both in the specific activities of characters in this book and by parallels to the real history of the world.<br />The treaties forced on the defeated Confederacy, intended to keep the CSA down and make sure it's bever again a threat and, as well, to humiliate it in return for all those years of humiliation that the USA has suffered will certainly bear the same bitter fruit that similar humiliating and devastating terms forced upon Germany bore.<br />Certainly the Red devils (metaphorically) of revolution and politics released during the war will not easily be exprcised so long as the lot of the Black man is not materially improved, and (as another reviewer has pointed out) the embittered artillery Sergeant who has already begun keeping a journal chronicling his struggles and his thoughts on what is wrong with the System will very likely be Important in what is to come...<br />Structurally, this book is pretty much the same as most of Turtledove's alternate history war novels -- the &quot;Worldwar&quot; books and the earlier ones in this series -- being recounted in a series of segments telling the actions and experiences of the members of a large cast of established characters (some entirely fictional, some alternates of real figures in history) whose viewpoints cover virtually all of the actions of the War and of the effects on those civilians who actually encounter its results {sort of like what John Brunner referred to as &quot;Tracking With Closeups&quot; in &quot;Stand on Zanzibar&quot;).  The segments vary from quite short vignettes to near-short-story lengths and are not -- in my opinion -- necessarily all equally necessary to advance the story; there is a redundancy here and there that i could have done without.<br />Another problem with the narrative technique that Turtledove has chosen, in my opinion, is that it tends to make it difficult to see the characters as people rather than as labelled cardboard figures.  Thus, one is less likely to be less interested in their problems and their fates than one is in the overall sweep of the narrative.

The segments vary from quite short vignettes to near-short-story lengths and are not -- in my opinion -- necessarily all equally necessary to advance the story; there is a redundancy here and there that i could have done without.<br />Another problem with the narrative technique that Turtledove has chosen, in my opinion, is that it tends to make it difficult to see the characters as people rather than as labelled cardboard figures.  Thus, one is less likely to be less interested in their problems and their fates than one is in the overall sweep of the narrative.

To fully appreciate this book, it helps to have read Miles's previous adventure, &quot;Komarr&quot;, which ends just about exactly where this one picks up.  However, Ms Bujold does include enough backstory in this volume to get by on.<br />The author's dedication includes several ladies listed only by first names -- among them &quot;Jane&quot; (Austen) and &quot;Georgette&quot; (Heyer).  Certainly, the ladies' spirits are hovering close ocer this story, because it is a thoroughly enjoyable Comedy Of Manners from start to finish.<br />Part of the fun, though one tends to cringe as one looks ahead, is in watching the step by step manner in which Miles Vorkosigan, the resourceful former covert ops whiz and youngest Imperial Auditor, who *always* comes out ahead no matter how hopeless the situation, meticulously setting up an inevitable Hideous Flaming Social Disaster for himself.  Only the truly brilliant can be truly stupid when they Miss The Point and push on, anyway, and Miles is beyond brilliant.<br />Miles, you see, has Fallen In Love.  For real and for permanent, this time, it looks like.  And he has no clue at all as to how normal people connect up and pair off in the Real World.<br />Of course, he has helpers, partners and accomplices in setting up his own humiliation -- his clone-brother Mark arrives with a true Mad Scientist in tow and sets up a lab in Miles's basement.<br />Three beautiful sisters with conflicting motives and plans for various of the male characters help to stir the brew.<br />And then there are the butter bugs... but we won't talk about the butter bugs here, except that they are Rather Important to the plot.<br />&quot;Mother, Father, I'd like you to meet... She's getting *away*!&quot;<br />If you enjoy a romp through society's ins and outs; if you have enjoyed Georgette Heyer's wonderful Regency romances, then you must try this book.<br />And if you like it as well as i think you will, and decide you *must* know more about Miles and his family and Barrayar, then either jump *all* the way back to &quot;Cordelia's Honor&quot;, which is the two novels that are earliest in series order (&quot;Shards of Honor&quot; and &quot;Barrayar&quot;), or you might want to jump back to &quot;The Warrior's Apprentice&quot;, which is the beginning of Miles's adventures.<br />Or you might just want to pick up any of the series and enjoy yourself.family and Barrayar, then either jump *all* the way back to &quot;Cordelia's Honor&quot;, which is the two novels that are earliest in series order (&quot;Shards of Honor&quot; and &quot;Barrayar&quot;), or you might want to jump back to &quot;The Warrior's Apprentice&quot;, which is the beginning of Miles's adventures.<br />Or you might just want to pick up any of the series and enjoy yourself.	2001-06-07

But there's really about the same amount of story from series to series -- which means that things have to happen faster and closer together to get it all in.<br />Which means things can get a little crowded, muddled or confusing, which means periodically one of the charcters explains things to another character -- entertainingly, but it's still an expository lump.<br />The standard Eddings characters are all here -- Althalus, the thief, recruited as a sort of disciple by Dweia, one of three sibling gods whose conflicts are the basis for the story, is amazingly similar to what you'd get if Silk had Belgarath's's sorcerous abilities.  Eliar is Garion or Berit -- the eager young man who has to learn some lessons the hard way.<br />And so on -- just as most Heinlein novels, Eddings books are stocked with pleasantly familiar characters constructed out of the Very Finest Cardboard, who make their way through various horrific but not particularly frightening (to the reader, anyway) adventures until, after some sacrifices, they arrive at the happy ending.  Along the way, they exchange clever/flippant/dry/cynical badinage and make jokes about their adventures and the way in which the young girl-type people (to use this books rather arch term) pursue the young boy-type people with marriage on their minds.<br />No previous Eddings book has ever been particularly earth-shatteringly important or ground-breaking, and certainly, this one doesn't change the pattern or break the mold.<br />But it's good for a pleasant afternoon or two and, so long as you're not looking for Incredible Significance or Deep Meaning in your fantasy it's certainly somewhat above the average in quality.  And it will certainly satisfy a carving for light fantasy for a while...<br />As a character in the movie &quot;Zachariah&quot; says &quot;[It's] what ye're lookin' for -- if that's what ye're lookin' for...&quot; -- a remark that might well issue from the mouth of an Eddings character.it's good for a pleasant afternoon or two and, so long as you're not looking for Incredible Significance or Deep Meaning in your fantasy it's certainly somewhat above the average in quality.

The concept that there would be &quot;vampire groupies&quot;, while i hadn't thought about it, makes pefect sense.  Certainly, such being the case, there would be vampire bars and vampire-cruise bars, where groupies could make contact with vamps.<br />The concept of vampires having full civil rights under law, but sometimes finding it rather difficult to get those rights supported has resonances that are reinforced by the Southern setting.<br />And every book set in the South involving working-class characters has to have a character named Bubba.  I *liked* Bubba.<br />Structurally, this is a more-or-less standard Southern Gothic mystery -- the kind where the killer turns out not to be the mysterious stranger who arrived just before the killings started, but rather the third cousin twice removed of every important character in the book, whose twisted sexual urges as a result of generations of inbreeding drive him to...<br />Well, you know what i mean -- it's one of Those with neet added dimensions in narrator Sookie's special ability and the admixture of vampires as suspects and victims.<br />The mystery is reasonably logically resolved, and the author doesn't cheat.<br />I rather hope for more books in the same setting by Charlaine Harris -- and the ending of this one is certainly open for some ... &quot;interesting&quot; ... sequels.<br />((Structurally, this book is rather reminiscent of &quot;Who Censored Roger Rabbit&quot;, the book on which the Disney film was (very) loosely based -- it's a straight mystery played out in a world with one wild-card fantasy element added that could change everything...))ly, this book is rather reminiscent of &quot;Who Censored Roger Rabbit&quot;, the book on which the Disney film was (very) loosely based -- it's a straight mystery played out in a world with one wild-card fantasy element added that could change everything...))	2001-06-04

(Mercedes Lackey is a particularly prominent practitioner.)<br />This book takes off from that situation, and elements of it walk throughout the text, but it's not *too* heavy-handedly applied.<br />I rather like the manner in which Briggs limits the scope of her action, thus giving herself a nicely-sized cast with a limited number of spear-carriers for author and reader to keep track of, but still conveying to the reader the manner in which the sort of society she has visualised depends on every member to get through the seasons.<br />Quick summary -- in a mountain valley in a world where the Church has banned magic, and the wild magic has been bound away, leaving only evil bloodmages able to practise magic, Aren, just married after having resigned herself to spinsterhood, has been hiding ther &quot;taint&quot; of being mage-born all her life.<br />Suddenly some event in a war going on somewhere else releases the binding on the wild magic, which begins to return; events attendant isolate the valley where Aren lives, trapping the locals and a troop of renegade mercenaries and preventing their contact with the Outside.<br />And Aren, suddenly widowed, begins to feel her gift come to life.<br />The story isn't complex, but it has some nice twists and turns in its development to what is, after all, pretty obviously inevitable relatively early in the book; i congratulate Briggs on managing to make if look as if Aren isn't, essentially, single-handedly saving the situation when, to a great extent, she *is*... While the other characters are generally at least interesting, and well-sketched, and brave and (many) skilled, if not for Aren and her banned-by-the-Church magical gifts (and the magical help they enable her to summon), the whole story would be shorter and less pleasant.<br />Actually, my favourite parts of the book, in general, were the varied &quot;wildings&quot; (magical beings who gradually return to the land after its magic is unbound at the beginning of the book) that Aren encounters and must learn how to either co-exist with, control, or defeat/banish, as she learns more about her abilities and as those abilities grow.<br />The wildings range from the will'o'the wisp and such, up through more powerful beings (ghosts and fetches and such), some friendly, some inimical, and some neutral.<br />And among the rather more powerful, and *probably* friendly, is the hob of Hob's Mountain, the last of his kind, who befriends Aren, offers to train her and to aid the villagers in their parallel struggles with raiders and bad wildings... for a price.<br />The price shouldn't be all *that* hard to guess.<br />The hob's sometimes sardonic, sometimes acid, sometimes gentle tongue and his general attitude that it may be a life-or-death situation but that doesn't mean you can't have *fun* rather reminded me of Emma Bull's poukha, which is a *good* thing to be reminded of.<br />((In fact, if you enjoy &quot;The Hob's Bargain&quot; and you haven't yet read Bull's &quot;War for the Oaks&quot;, i recommend you seek out &quot;War for the Oaks&quot; immediately, a fantasy with a somewhat more-intense take on similar themes to this one, with a modern urban setting.))of the book, in general, were the varied &quot;wildings&quot; (magical beings who gradually return to the land after its magic is unbound at the beginning of the book) that Aren encounters and must learn how to either co-exist with, control, or defeat/banish, as she learns more about her abilities and as those abilities grow. <br />The wildings range from the will'o'the wisp and such, up through more powerful beings (ghosts and fetches and such), some friendly, some inimical, and some neutral.<br />And among the rather more powerful, and *probably* friendly, is the hob of Hob's Mountain, the last of his kind, who befriends Aren, offers to train her and to aid the villagers in their parallel struggles with raiders and bad wildings... for a price.<br />The price shouldn't be all *that* hard to guess.<br />The hob's sometimes sardonic, sometimes acid, sometimes gentle tongue and his general attitude that it may be a life-or-death situation but that doesn't mean you can't have *fun* rather reminded me of Emma Bull's poukha, which is a *good* thing to be reminded of.<br />((In fact, if you enjoy &quot;The Hob's Bargain&quot; and you haven't yet read Bull's &quot;War for the Oaks&quot;, i recommend you seek out &quot;War for the Oaks&quot; immediately, a fantasy with a somewhat more-intense take on similar themes to this one, with a modern urban setting.))	2001-05-22

In chronological story order of books published in Miller and Lee's &quot;Liaden&quot; series, &quot;Plan B&quot; is, so far, The End Of the Line (and, be warned, though the ending of this book is not quite so screamingly tense as the end of a chapter play installment, it *is* &quot;To Be Continued&quot;.<br />I think i would not recommend following the stories in true chronology -- the two stories in &quot;Pilot's Choice&quot; are, in fact, earliest in story order, but i don't think they're really easily understandable if you read them first -- too much is, i think, assumed to be known to the reader.<br />No, i would find &quot;Partners in Necessity&quot;, which collects the first three stories actually written, and i would happily devour all three stories in that volume, getting to know Shan and Priscilla and Val Con and Miri and their friends and relations, as learning something about the wonderful Universe that Miller and Lee have created for their characters to play in.<br />And get to know Edger and his companions, the Clutch-Turtles.  That alone is almost enough reward for reading the first volume...<br />*Then* drop back about thirty or forty Standards and read &quot;Pilot's Choice&quot;, which explains much and foreshadows more.<br />And then come here to &quot;Plan B&quot;.<br />Our Story So Far:  Korval, one of the mightiest clans of ultra-civilised Liaden, has clashed with a super-secret organisation within the Ministry of the Interior.  Powerful as Korval is, temporally and militarily, it is felt best for the Clan proper, the members of the central yos'Galan and yos'Phelium families, to disperse and continue the battle from widely-separated locations.<br />Captain Shan yos'Galan and his lifemate, the wizard Priscilla Mendoza, First Mate, aboard &quot;Dutiful Passage&quot;, Korval's most powerful ship, are seeking Shan's foster brother, Val Con yos'Phelium, rightful head of the clan, who is fleeing the vengeance of the Ministry of the Interior, for which he had been an Agent of Change (a spy/asassin).<br />With Val Con is his new lifemate, Miri, a former mercenary soldier who, believing herself all her life to be Terran, has recently discovered that she is the long lost scion of an important Liaden clan, one of Korval's closest trading partners.  They are also fleeing the Juntavas, the Galaxy's most powerful criminal organisation, which has the death-mark on Miri.<br />Arriving at the Clanhouse of Clan Erob, on that clan's home world, all is going well (though a recent series of civil disturbances have unsettled the world)... when the Yxtrang, the cruel space-raiding race who are, as the Clutch Turtles asy, &quot;the third race of Man&quot; arrive and invade, leaving Val Con and Miri and some other mercenaries trapped on world to organise a defense...  And leaving &quot;Dutiful Passage&quot;, who has been having troubles of her own, sailing unaware through hyperspace straight into the midst of a powerful invasion fleet.<br />Now Read On...<br />Some questions left over from the previous books remain unanswered, as do some more Interesting Points raised in the course of this book, at the end.<br />There is definitely one more book coming, i believe, and i *think* at least one more after that.<br />I hope so. I want some explanations.  I want to know just how the co-founder of Korval, Jela, was related to the Yxtrang.

US	50835237	R1BP4YVIAPHMG7	0441008232	668848414	Bobby's Girl	Books	3	22	24	N	N	Apocalypse Troll Lite	I'll begin by saying that whoever J.D.Austin is, i would guess that he or she has seen military service, and probably in the Navy, at that.  About half of the important human characters in this book are Navy vets, and, to this Navy vet at least, they ring true -- written by someone who knows whereof they speak.<br />That aside, this is a cheerful romp through some of the same territory that my brother (David Weber)'s &quot;Apocalypse Troll&quot; covered a lot more seriously.<br />The storytelling is neatly divided between a current action story set on Earth and a series of flashbacks set on Planet Thradon, beginning two years ago as the latest in a series of wars between the planet's two largest nations has go badly indeed for the larger of the two.<br />To begin: General Ket Mhulhar has been on diplomatic duty, and consequently is not in her home country when the big coup goes down; as senior surviving military officer, she is suddenly Premier.  But it's not safe for her to stay.  The Space Force is going to send her away to a distant planet, which only one ship on the whole world can reach.  Knowing she is safe, they can base a Resistance movement on that fact.<br />But, she has to be disguised surgically to match the inhabitants of her new foster world.  Which is, of course, Earth.  Working from pictures, the doctors do as well as they can.<br />Possibly too well.<br />As the one Thradonian who has actually *been* to Earth looks at the unconscious form lying on the table, he bemoans the fact that with those looks, keeping a low profile on Earth may be difficult -- &quot;Terran males&quot; he explains &quot;go to sleep hoping they'll *dream* about girls who look like that!&quot;  On the other hand, he allows, she *is* headed for the one place on Earth where beauty and oddity hand-in-hand are taken for granted -- Los Angeles.<br />But it's too late to change -- into the ship and off she goes, arriving two years later on Earth, where she is taken under the wing of a retired couple.  A retired couple whose son is a successful independent film writer/producer/director (think Tarentino, from the plot descriptions of his films).  A film maker whose script girl has just quit.<br />And &quot;Kathy&quot; goes to work for Bobby, soon talking him into letting her try wearing the &quot;Producer&quot; hat on this film so that he can concentrate on directing.  And she tries to decide just what she will do when the Bad Guys manage to follow her here.<br />Meanwhile, back on Thradon, the military of Dalyi, Ket's home nation, are organising a Resistance.<br />The two stories alternate neatly, the Thadon story skipping closer anf closer to Present Day, and Kathy and her Terran friends get ready for the Arrival...<br />Though much of the story is played lightly, there are darker underpinnings, and some fairly serious thoughts about war and peace and patriotism and chauvinism, not to mention the responsibilities of honor and friendship.<br />The characters, human and Thradonian alike, though mostly lightly sketched are still acceptably plausible -- one of them is a retired Master Chief Petty Officer who was a Seaman Apprentice aboard the Forrestal off the coast of Viet Nam the day a missile on deck cooked off and started one of the most terrifying fires ever to strike a ship that didn't eventually sink, and he *absolutely* reads like the real thing.<br />Both sides in the conflict on Thradon learn lessons that we haven't yet learnt fully and properly here on Earth, and it is obvious that its aftermath is going to poison Thradonian society and politics for a long time to come, even after the &quot;Good Guys&quot; win a (comparatively) near-bloodless victory.<br />But it all comes out in the end more or less for the best.<br />One Thing More Dept: If Austin writes any more books -- either sequels to this one or independent settings -- i hope he takes us back to &quot;The Stupid Elf&quot;, one of the more amusing sleazy bars i've run across in fiction of film in a while.  I'd like to know more about the &quot;Elf&quot; and Buzz, the unflappable ex-cop bartender.tion of film in a while.

And they're not too concerned as to how he does it, either.<br />Of course, he does.<br />Interestingly enough, as much as &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot;, i felt strong echoes of other Westerns in this story (not surprising, given the setting).  I was soemwhat reminded of Donald Hamilton's novel (and the film made from it), &quot;The Big Country&quot;, whenever Spenser found himself confronting Preacher, the leader of the local Bad Element.<br />But the film i began thinking of, more and more strongly as i got into the last third of the book, was Sergio Leone's masterpiece, &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;, which i *strongly* recommend; in fact, after reading this book, you might enjoy spending a Saturday or Sunday afternoon watching a double-feature -- &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; and &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;, both of which are available from Amazon.<br />All in all, Parker is still not up to his best in this boook, but it's better than some others in the series.  I will wanr those who haen't read parker or Spenser before that this is *not* the place to start -- given that Spenser has History with virtually every character in the book, History that is alluded to but never really stated, a goodly part of the book's setup is between the lines.<br />I'm still waiting for the book when Spenser comes face-to-face with Sunny Randall or Jesse Stone; given the number of acquaintances in common that they have, and the relatively small area in which all three operate, it has to happen.<br />A Note: Parker has either spent some Quality Time in Atlanta or Done His Research Well -- both in this book and in the second Jesse Stone book he gets the nightclub-and-shopping district, Buckhead, just about perfect.  But i think he's still getting the local terminology wrong about roads, with local characters referring to Interstate Highways as &quot;Route so-and-so&quot; -- to Spenser, &quot;Route 20&quot; would be I-20, which cuts through town down by Turner Field.  But if he asked an Atlantan how to get to &quot;Route 20&quot;, he'd probably wind up about  seventy miles north of there, at Georgia 20 near the Mall of Georgia...ory that is alluded to but never really stated, a goodly part of the book's setup is between the lines.<br />I'm still waiting for the book when Spenser comes face-to-face with Sunny Randall or Jesse Stone; given the number of acquaintances in common that they have, and the relatively small area in which all three operate, it has to happen.<br />A Note: Parker has either spent some Quality Time in Atlanta or Done His Research Well -- both in this book and in the second Jesse Stone book he gets the nightclub-and-shopping district, Buckhead, just about perfect.

If for nothing but the Liaden books, i would praise Stephe Pagel and his Meisha Merlin press to the skies; but wait! -- there's more!<br />However, what we're here for is to talk about Liadens and Terrans and their interactions.<br />Indeed, there is a strong flavour of Georgette Heyer's Regency romances in most of the Liaedn Universe material -- a bit less so in &quot;Agent of Change&quot; and &quot;Carpe Diem&quot;, which are a bit more action novels and less contemplative than &quot;Conflict of Honors&quot; or the two halves of the present book, both of which play out their conflicts primarily in the area of melant'i and interpersonal relationships.<br />The first, &quot;Local Custom&quot;, makes clear, in a way that the references in &quot;Conflict&quot; didn't really, just what a shocking misalliance Er Thom yos'Galan made for himself, and what a scandal and problem not just for him but for his entire Clan it must be.<br />Luckily all is well and works out in the end, because Korval is going to *need* Shan and his sisters.<br />While &quot;Local Custom&quot; is, shall we say, Important, and quite enjoyable, i found it more of a light read and less Deeply Interesting than &quot;Scout's Progress&quot;, the second half of the book.<br />One of Heyer's more useful plots is the one in which one or other or both of the main protagonists is unaware of the true identity of the other; this is the basic McGuffin that makes &quot;Scout's Progress&quot; go.<br />Aelliana Caylon is a *painfully* unworldly woman, eldest daughter of a Clan of second rank.  If she were not able to contribute to the clan's coffers through her work as a mathematics instructor, she would be expected to contract repeated profitable contract marriages.  ((This is even nastier than the situation in Heyer, wherein a young woman might well expect to be forced into a loveless marriage for her family's benefit -- but only once.))<br />Matters are, of course, made worse by the scheming of her elder brother, the nadelm.<br />Her brother, Ran Del Caylan, is a true villain.  He is nasty because he *can* be.  And hse has not get enough money f her own to flee him and also to be able to survive afterward.<br />But Things Change when Aelliana, fleeing Ran Del, falls in with some of the Scouts that she teaches Advanced Mathematics, and goes with them to a new, elaborate gambling house...<br />And she wins a ship.<br />Now all she needs is to learn how to fly it.<br />And that is where a former Scout she meets as he is working as a amintenance tech at the port facility where her new ship is berthed.<br />His name is Daav; she -- unworldly as she is -- never happens to discover his Clan or House.<br />Meanwhile, Daav yos'Phelium is being pushed into a contract marriage for the benefit of Korval which neither he nor the lady want or welcome.<br />The working-out of their relationship, and the flowering of Aelliana as she realises that she is *not* the useless incompetent that her brother has her more than half-convinced that she is -- and the hideous danger that comes upon her as a result -- make this my second-favourite Liaden story (after &quot;A Conflict of Honors&quot;).  ((Also, it, like the first story in this volume, painlessly feeds us a few necessary Large Expository Lumps regarding how the overall Liaden system functions, Korval Clan history and just what pilot quals and training are like.))<br />((At least one other reviewer has remarked that they don't know what to recommend to the reader who finishes these stories and wants more, more or less similar, freading material, aside form the actual Regency Romances of Georgett Heyer - i might recommend the &quot;Mageworlds&quot; books of MacDonald &amp; Doyle, the series begins with &quot;The Price of the Stars&quot;...))er, the nadelm.<br />Her brother, Ran Del Caylan, is a true villain.

She does, and the usual results of giving Honor Harrington spaceships to play with ensue. (This woman attracts Forlorn Hope Last Stands like Jessica Fletcher atttracts murderers...)<br />Meanwhile, on Grayson, various reactionary elemsnts, offended at the thought of a woman having power, and even more offended that Honor had made no attempt to hide her relationship with her late lover, are trying to stir up bogotry and hatred against her...  And some of them are very powerful men, indeed; men who will stop at nothing to discredit her, even if it means the deaths of countless innocents -- possibly even their own people!<br />But what this book is mostly notable for, in my opinion, is that it shows us more of the Grayson State Church of Humanity Unbound, and its God the Tester...  And of Reverend Hanks, the physically but spiritually great man who stands at its head; a truly Good Man in the way so few, even religious, are truly Good Men.

The problem that many of these people fail to recognise is that such an animal may be tame, but is not domesticated like a dog, who has thousands of generations of genetic coding behind him that tell him humans are boss, no matter what.  To the wolf or wolf-dog, the human is boss only so long as he remains strong in the wolf's eye, remains worthy to be alpha male of the pack.  All too often, the owners of such animals find that they do something totally natural... which the wolf interprets as a sign of weakness, and the wolf makes his move to be alpha.  Among wolves, this is a natural occurence, and, as soon as the weaker animal submits via body language, the other animal is genetically programmed to literally be unable to continue the attack; but if the weaker does not submit, the stronger will kill it.  Humans, unfortunately, cannot signal submission in the proper mode, and so the owner suddenly finds his pet trying seriously to tear out his throat and may or may not survive, but will certainly be hurt.<br />So what has that got to do with a science-fiction review?<br />The Hrinn, an alien race who make up rather more than half of the &quot;good guy&quot; characters in this book, are basically seven-foot-tall wolves with double-thumbed hands.  Their society is organised along the lines of the Terran wolf-pack, and they have the same built-in dominance/submission reflex to determine packleaders.<br />They also have the ability to &quot;blueshift&quot; -- basically to shift into a hyper-metabolism state in which they literally can move faster than human eyes can perceive.  The time they can blueshift is, necessarily, limited by available energy reserves stored within their bodies, and too much blueshifting exhausts them or, in extreme cases, can even burn out the ability to blueshift.<br />Which is what happened on a previous mission, to Heyoka Blackeagle, a hrinn raised on Earth by a human -- an Oglala Sioux. (That would be in &quot;Black on Black&quot;, the prevous book by this author)<br />Heyoka, along with a human partner, is assigned to teach an experimental Ranger team composed of mixed human and hrinn personnel how to work together in a military structure in order to fight the insectoid flek, a race that lands, kills off the local inhabitants, and then transforms conquered worlds to match their smoky, heavy-metal rich homeworld.<br />The problem is that native hrinn, raised on their homeworld in their native society, cannot or will not set aside their natural dominance/submission instincts, and cannot seem to learn the human concepts of obeying orders not because the person issuing the order can kill you if you don't but because he is in command.  They also have no concept of military strategy, being suublimely confident that nothing can stand up to them head-on.  Oh, and they regard humans as inherently weak and inferior and not worthy to command because they cannot blueshift.<br />So, here on a world that the flek began to &quot;terraform&quot; and then, for no known reason, abandoned, this ill-conceived and inherently unstable military unit is training and doing maneuvers.<br />And then someone discovers and accidentally activates, a flek transport grid that beings the flek's attention back to the world, as the hrinn/human interface begins to fall apart.<br />Meanwhile, over in the communities of the laka, the natives, yet a third story strand begins, as something is going wrong with the attitudes of some members of the thoroughly-controlled, rigidly-structured laka society... some of the breeders are beginning to remember racial memories of &quot;fighting&quot; and &quot;attacking&quot;...<br />All three strands will eventually come together and form a pattern -- an aspect of hrinn religion says that all of life is controlled by patterns, and the current one may well be &quot;stars over stars&quot;... if anyone can determine what it is and what it means.<br />Another reviewer apparently compared the previous book in the series to Heinlein's &quot;Citizen of the Galaxy&quot;; having not read it, i cannot speak to that.  However, what this book rather more reminds me of is a typical Andre Norton &quot;juvenile&quot; from the same period -- a world that is essentially a puzzle set for a relatively young protagonist who discovers that he is, somehow, the focus of Great Powers which he must learn either to control or to avoid in order to solve the riddles he faces and save the situation in the end.<br />Done well, this is formula almost always yields a strong story.  While not up to Norton's level yet, Wentworth gives us a generally-satisfying tale that, while it may disappoint in some ways (i have a few problems with the whole concept of the hrinn as a race, which cost the book at least one star in my rating) still pretty well delivers on what the author intended.<br />I shall probably make it a point to read the next volume, in order to see if Wentworth can keep things together and moving forward.s controlled by patterns, and the current one may well be &quot;stars over stars&quot;... if anyone can determine what it is and what it means.<br />Another reviewer apparently compared the previous book in the series to Heinlein's &quot;Citizen of the Galaxy&quot;; having not read it, i cannot speak to that.

US	50835237	R304QVXGO1WWBM	0061020680	116769240	Mort	Books	5	11	12	N	N	Where It REALLY Begins	Chronologically, this is the fourth of the Discworld novels.  In many ways, however, it may be the best place to begin the series, reading a few more and then later going back and filling in &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;, &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot; and &quot;Equal Rites&quot;.<br />&quot;Mort&quot; is the first of the &quot;Death&quot; sub-series witin the larger Discworld series as a whole (which includes &quot;The Reaper Man&quot;, &quot;Soul Music&quot; and &quot;Hogfather&quot;).  The Death of the Discworld is an interesting character -- and he is very much a *character*, rather than an event or a Presence, though he is those, too.  Death, after eons of being basically, well, Death, has decided he wants to understand the Human Condition.  I mean, being an awesome Anthropomorphised Personification, feared by virtually all, is all well and good... but he *still* doesn't understand why people put fruit in their drinks.<br />In this volume, we are introduced to young Mort, a farmer lad who just isn't suited for farming.  Or any other trade anyone can think of.  So his father takes him to the Hiring Fair in another town, rather in the manner of a man taking a horse that's only lame if you try to ride it to a Fair where no-one has ever seen it or him.  But no-one seems willing to take on Mort, even so. Until the stroke of midnight, when a black-cloaked figure on a big white horse rides up...<br />And so Mort is apprenticed to Death.<br />He learns to take The Duty, as Death refers to riding out personally as a courtesy to the more important decedents (witches and wizards know in advance when they will die and they and priests expect a personal visit from Death as a professional courtesy, so to speak; Death also appears personally to Kings and Emperors and such). Eventually, Death trusts Mort to do The Duty on his own for a couple of days while Death takes a brief holiday to learn more about humanity.<br />Which explains why, when a rather nasty Duke attempts to asassinate his beautiful young cousin, before she can take the throne, Mort tries to change things and takes the Duke, not the Princess.<br />But history has inertia and elasticity, and soon the imbalance between What Is Supposed To Be and What Actually Is begins to threaten reality.<br />And Death is off on holiday and things keep on Getting Worse.<br />This is the volume where Pratchett really begins to hit his stride and bring the Discworld to life -- an actual (albeit Strange) place with real (albeit extreme) characters whose problems are often recogniseable variations on our own.  He begins to truly master the dry, sometimes sardonic, tone of narration that makes the goings-on so much more funny... and sometimes, unexpectedly, much more sad and throat-catching.<br />The little touches -- the telling little bits of description not directly involved in the storyline as such but commenting or pointing out, almost as a tour-guide might, really begin to show up here, Unseen University begins to resemble the institution as portrayed in later books, and Pratchett begins explaining more of the physics, meta- and otherwise, of the Discworld.<br />The perfect introduction to the Discworld -- then, n my opinion, one should temporarily skip over the next three (&quot;Sourcery&quot;, &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot; and &quot;Pyramids&quot;) to read &quot;Guards! Guards&quot;, the first of the &quot;Guards&quot; subseries, then hop back to &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot;, which plays merry havoc with Shakespeare (particularly The Scottish Play) for a proper introduction to the &quot;Witches&quot; subseries...<br />After that, you're on your own.<br />But they're all rousing good fun and will, at least once per volume, make you think a bit, too...asassinate his beautiful young cousin, before she can take the throne, Mort tries to change things and takes the Duke, not the Princess.<br />But history has inertia and elasticity, and soon the imbalance between What Is Supposed To Be and What Actually Is begins to threaten reality.<br />And Death is off on holiday and things keep on Getting Worse.<br />This is the volume where Pratchett really begins to hit his stride and bring the Discworld to life -- an actual (albeit Strange) place with real (albeit extreme) characters whose problems are often recogniseable variations on our own.

Now the best way to really *learn* how and why comics work is to get this book,and to allow one of the true masters of the craft to share with you his sixty-plus years' worth of experience and innovation.<br />Learn how and why comics resemble film - and why they don't.  Learn pacing, narrative and page beakdowns.<br />It's almost like having Eisner himself standing there, pointing out what to do and what not to do.<br />And anyone who thinks that Eisner must be irrelevant to comics because his most famous work was so long ago need look no further than the splash page of the fourth issue of DC's &quot;Harley Quinn&quot; (March 2001)... nor past the ending of the same comic, which subtly pays tribute to the &quot;Spirit&quot; story about an ordinary man named Gerhard Schnobble -- the one that Eisner has called his own favourite of the strip's entire run.<br />You want to do comics and you don't have access to professional training?<br />Buy this book.<br />You want to do comics and you &quot;do* have access to professional training?<br />Buy this book, anyway..	2001-03-10

((Initial revelation of potential non-disinterest: I am David Weber's elder brother.))<br />First, while i think the cover's better than the one on &quot;Worlds of Honor&quot;, it's still not right -- those legs belong on a tree-antelope, not a tree-cat.<br />&quot;But what's *in* it?&quot;, right?<br />This is another anthology, featuring three stories by Dave and one by Eric Flint.<br />The first story is &quot;Ms. Midshipwoman Harrington&quot;.  ((For a couple of reasons - ease of speaking being a major one, tradition another -- i think i'd have said &quot;misdhipman&quot;, but it's Dave's call -- his world, his ranks.))<br />The story of Honor's &quot;Snotty&quot; cruise, it fills in the background on remarks she makes during &quot;Among Enemies&quot; about having been on pirate-chasing missions in Silesia.<br />As usual, with Honor onboard, what ought to have been a relatively routine cruise with a bit of action and not much danger turns into something else. ((I mean, finding out you'll be serving with Honor Harrington is like being a cop in a small town finding out that Jessica Fletcher is visiting...)) And Ms. Midshipwoman Harrington finds that she must rise to the occasion when disaster strikes.  This story is a little more open and clear about the political maneuvering between the &quot;working&quot; Navy and the &quot;timeserving&quot; Navy (my terms) in which Honor's career is already inevitably enmeshed, long before she knows it or of it.<br />Also it has a Villain.  I'll be writing a longer review for my new website, wherein i'll go into my thoughts on Villains vs. Bad Guys in Dave's stories. (By my reckoning, Rob Pierre is a Bad Guy -- Pavel Young is a Villain.  Wossname who was behind the Dome failure is a Bad Guy [though with villainous tendencies] -- his dupe who Honor kills is a Villain.)<br />Second story is &quot;Changer of Worlds&quot;, which has been available for more than a year on my family website by David's kind permission; it's the story of Laughs Brightly, bondmated to Cloud Dancer, who returns to his clan bringing Golden Voice, his new mate.<br />We know these people a bit better under other names, suffice to say. (Hint -- one of them is also known as &quot;Nimitz&quot;)<br />(Skipping the Eric Flint story for right now, we get to Dave's third, &quot;Nightfall&quot;.)<br />&quot;Nightfall&quot; is one of those stories that eventually has to be told in some form, if only as footnotes in some other work, i guess, but which i'd as soon not read.  Despite the fact that there's a rather nasty little slice of spacewar let loose planetside in a major city, it's pretty much a static story of coup and countercoup and  political maneuver.<br />We aready know the fates, if not descriptions of the actual events, of a number of characters from other books.  &quot;Nightfall&quot; is the actual events.  I found it uninvolving and unneeded.<br />Now, back to Eric Flint's &quot;From the Highlands&quot;, which is, i think, the best piece of pure storytelling more or less for its own sake in the book.  All of the other three stories are there to plug holes in the canon, and read more or less like that.<br />&quot;Highlands&quot;, while it chronicles events that may well be as important in the future history of Manticore and Haven as the other three, just reads like a story Flint wanted to tell; in which we look at the ways Gryphon's Highlanders are like Scotland's.<br />Involving conflicting and complex loyalties personal, patriotic and political, it revolves around the kidnapping of a fourteen-year-old girl whose father, a Gryphon Highlander, is an Intelligence Analyst attached to Manticore's Embassy in the Solarian League's capital city, Chicago.<br />Not just any fourteen-year-old girl; we've seen her before, when she was four or so, asking her weeping father if Mama had made them all safe from the bad Peeps. And she is everything her mother's daughter should be -- she's already working on escape from her kidnappers when first we meet her.<br />Before the story is over, we will be involved with Helen's father, with her martial arts instructor, with Havenite and Manticoran Ambassadors and their respective Security Chiefs, a young Peep SS Intelligence Field Officer who faces a personal crisis of identity (he actually believes in the ideals of the Revolution), a dissipated Peep Marine Colonel who is rather more, various genetically-engineered &quot;super-soldiers&quot; and revolutionary former slaves and an expatriate, far-leftist Manticoran noblewoman, one of only three people kicked out of the House of Lords by vote of their peers.<br />Stir thoroughly, apply igniter and stand well back till the flames die down.<br />Serve hot.<br />I give the book three stars overall; just the first three stories would have gotten four, just the Weber stories alone about three stars.<br />Good solid reading till the next novel, but it goes by awfully dismayingly and disappointingly quickly, which is one of the problems of a fast pace.ppers when first we meet her.<br />Before the story is over, we will be involved with Helen's father, with her martial arts instructor, with Havenite and Manticoran Ambassadors and their respective Security Chiefs, a young Peep SS Intelligence Field Officer who faces a personal crisis of identity (he actually believes in the ideals of the Revolution), a dissipated Peep Marine Colonel who is rather more, various genetically-engineered &quot;super-soldiers&quot; and revolutionary former slaves and an expatriate, far-leftist Manticoran noblewoman, one of only three people kicked out of the House of Lords by vote of their peers.<br />Stir thoroughly, apply igniter and stand well back till the flames die down.<br />Serve hot.<br />I give the book three stars overall; just the first three stories would have gotten four, just the Weber stories alone about three stars.<br />Good solid reading till the next novel, but it goes by awfully dismayingly and disappointingly quickly, which is one of the problems of a fast pace.	2001-02-27
US	50835237	R2VHADJPHPTSM2	0965834530	527564446	Bridling Chaos	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A Difficult Trick, Performed Well	Writing a science-fiction mystery is a task difficult to do well -- either you get too involved in the SF aspects, and slight the mystery (or, worse yet, make the mystery impossible to legitimately solve because it turns on things that don't yet exist), or you concentrate on keeping the mystery scrupulously fair to the reader and wind up killing the Sense of Wonder that is essential to SF.<br />Usually SF mysteries are good mysteries but mediocre SF or Good SF but only middling mysteries... or, worst of all, bad SF and bad mysteries.<br />Which brings us to Lee Killough, who has quite nicely performed the trick three times (though i must say that the second of the three novels here reprinted is the weakest of the three, it is by no means a Bad Story).<br />Part of the equation in a story like this is to create a viewpoint character the reader will enjoy following and through whose eyes the society and background of the story will be presented, and Killough's Janna Brill and her aggravating partner, &quot;Mama&quot; Maxwell fit the bill perfectly.<br />Janna and Mama are &quot;lions&quot; (&quot;LEOs&quot; -- &quot;Law Enforcement Officers&quot;, in an example of the plausible future slang that Killough uses just enough of to give a sense of time and place, but not enough to require a glossary or footnotes), in a time when cops can no longer carry lethal weapons, when the internal-combustion engine has been outlawed and when giant ramjet starships carry colonists in suspended animation to new lives on distant worlds. And when the SCIB Card -- a universal ID card -- has supposedly made it impossible to avoid leaving a paper trail of your day-to-day life that documents where you've been and when you were there. And it's the death of a partner in a firm that specialises in outfitting colonial companies that drives the first story, in which we first meet our intrepid heroes. Mama is sure that killer is the dead man's partner... but his card records prove he was nowhere near the scene of death at the time of the crime.<br />In the end, justice is served and the stories all reach a satisfying conclusion.((Incidentally, based on the three books from them i have so far, i would pretty much recommend automatically buying anything you see with the Meisha Merlin imprint...))ear the scene of death at the time of the crime.<br />In the end, justice is served and the stories all reach a satisfying conclusion.((Incidentally, based on the three books from them i have so far, i would pretty much recommend automatically buying anything you see with the Meisha Merlin imprint...))	2000-09-22

Kicking off my second-favourite on-going space-opera series (aside from my brother's books, which i am *required* to like), this was a refreshing find back when i first pulled it down off the shelf and read the first couple pages... and discovered that i had to finish it that same day.While, as someone has pointed out, this *could* be read as a stand-alone book, unlike the first books in some series, a reader who stops here will be missing a lot of fun in the sequels and prequels that follow.The Rosselin-Matadi clan and their friends and enemies are all marvellous characters, but Beka's mentor and co-pilot, known only as &quot;the Professor&quot; is the most amusing and frustrating of the lot, as it becomes more and more obvious that he, somehow, is manipulating history itself.What sets this series aside from more ordinary space opera, i think, is the concept of the Adepts and the Mages -- both posessors of great power, who both sense and utilise what, for want of a better word, we might call &quot;the Force&quot;, but in completely different and mutually-conflicting manners. The three Rossellin-Metadi siblings, Beka, Owen and Ari, so different superficially but so similar in their drive and inability to admit defeat are worth getting to know, and the associates and enemies that they pick up along the way are a marvellously-assorted crew (not all of whom are even *nearly* what they appear to be).  But i must admit that the villains -- as opposed to adversaries, an important distinction in these books -- are just a bit *too* slimy and odious.  {If i ever run into the authors, though, i intend to ask them if they were thinking of &quot;Rio Lobo&quot; or of &quot;Assault on Precinct 13&quot; when they wrote one important sequence...}Recommended -- both this book and the entire series.	2000-09-22

The interesting protagonist  is there -- the glassblowing background is both interesting and unusual,  ranking with Kit Fielding, Tim Ekaterin and Sid Halley in that regard, but  the story is not all that great.<br />There is just a bot too much air of the  benevolent magician pulling a rabbit from his hat for our amazement -- and  a few too many rabbits from hats in the working-out of the story.<br />The  motives of most of the characters don't really ring true, and the McGuffin  -- what's actually *on* the video tape that so many Nasty People seem to  want -- has an even more tinny sound.  The true identity of a major  character, which has bothered Logan for much of the book, while important,  is merely stated, rather than revealed through action or characterisation,  when it becomes necessary for us to know.<br />But the way to get over thin  ice is quickly, and Francis (as usual) certainly can cover dodgy ground  quickly.<br />As frequently is the case, the big climax turns around the  hero's specialities; in this book the climax is in the protagonist's  glass-blowing shop, where, among other things, a glob of  1800-fahrenheit-degree molten glass on the end of a punty rod makes  amemorable means of persuasion and weapon.  Also, as usual with Francis, it  is wise to read carefully all the apparently inconsequential scene-setting  descriptions of aspects and tricks of the protagonist's trade. (My only  regret along those lines is that the rabbit pulled from the hat in this  regard is just a small bunny, not the man-eating rodent from &quot;Monty  Python &amp; the Holy Grail&quot;, which would have been a bit more  helpful.)<br />Also, the love interest and romance in this one are as uniquely  Franciscan as any of his books contain -- which means that, as is often the  case, he hits us from left field with an amusing and truly romantic  affair.<br />Several characters, who -- we are *told*, but not truly  *convinced* -- are central to the plot are wonderful eccentrics, and the  group of volunteer bodyguards that Logan accumulates as he goes along are  both touching and amusing, clearly painted with a typical few deft strokes  of the Francis brush.<br />If there are any earlier Francis books you haven't  read (with the possible exceptions of &quot;Slayride&quot; and &quot;Trial  Run&quot;), i'd recommend picking them up and reading them before grabbing  this one.<br />But you should definitely read this one, because, overall,  you'll probably enjoy it.nes is that the rabbit pulled from the hat in this  regard is just a small bunny, not the man-eating rodent from &quot;Monty  Python &amp; the Holy Grail&quot;, which would have been a bit more  helpful.)<br />Also, the love interest and romance in this one are as uniquely  Franciscan as any of his books contain -- which means that, as is often the  case, he hits us from left field with an amusing and truly romantic  affair.<br />Several characters, who -- we are *told*, but not truly  *convinced* -- are central to the plot are wonderful eccentrics, and the  group of volunteer bodyguards that Logan accumulates as he goes along are  both touching and amusing, clearly painted with a typical few deft strokes  of the Francis brush.<br />If there are any earlier Francis books you haven't  read (with the possible exceptions of &quot;Slayride&quot; and &quot;Trial  Run&quot;), i'd recommend picking them up and reading them before grabbing  this one.<br />But you should definitely read this one, because, overall,  you'll probably enjoy it.	2000-09-17

This book, somehow, seems rather &quot;French&quot; to me (in  keeping with the original source of the tale, if nothing else, i  suppose).<br />But i suppose this &quot;Frenchness&quot; i seem to sense may  come because i suspect that at least part of the imagery for this book came  from Cocteau's wonderful 1940's film with Jean Marais and Josephine Day  (which i heartily recommend to anyone who enjoys any version of the story)  -- Beauty's nightmare of running down a dark corridor lighted at intervals  by candles in wall sconces certainly resonated with some of the imagery in  the film, and her father's first view of the Beast and his costume  certainly did also.<br />But this beast is different from Cocteau's; there is  less of the frisson (however mild) that we get when Cocteau's Beast, his  hands covered with the smoking blood of his prey, claws at Beauty's door.  This Beast, almost from the start (except when he is terrifying Beauty's  father, to set in motion the events that will bring Beauty to him) is  quieter, more melancholic; a philosopher-Beast, one might say.<br />I'm not  sure if it was altogether a good idea to remove the mantle of scariness  from the Beast, even if it was then transferred to other elements, some  part of the existing tale, some invented for this book; i feel as if the  Beast should *gradually* be revealed as harmless.<br />One of the most  telling moments in the Cocteau film (i seem to be referring to that a lot)  is at the very end, when the handsome Prince who was the Beast just moments  before tells Beauty not to be afraid -- and she looks shyly up at him,  holding his hands in hers, and says &quot;I like to be a little frightened  -- with you.&quot;<br />&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; at heart, is  partially about discovering that that which we fear -- the Unknown, in the  strictest sense -- is not that scarey.  Facing our fears and confronting  and laying them to rest -- if only in a metaphorical manner -- is part of  its appeal.  To a great extent, this book doesn't offer that, except in the  last third or so.<br />But, of course, it is Very Much about discovering that  a scarey exterior may hide a gentle and noble heart; and that even the  smallest and weakest of us can, if we be determined enough, and hold on and  don't falter, no matter what odds seem against us arrayed, make a  Difference.<br />And that, added to lovely prose and smooth storytelling,  makes this a four-star read and i recommend it.ot;<br />&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; at heart, is  partially about discovering that that which we fear -- the Unknown, in the  strictest sense -- is not that scarey.

((In Dahl's case this reads like a smarmy  condecension to the Dear Little Kiddies' Limited Comprehension; in the case  of this book it seemed like a First-Time Author trying to be Clever because  That's What Kiddies Like...))<br />And the opening pages, in which she  demonstrated her arch inventiveness with such strokes as  &quot;Muggles&quot; to mean non-magician humans, and described Harry's home  life with his uncle and aunt and cousin in such over-the-top whimsical  terms that i almost got seasick reading them, almost put me off the book  entirely.<br />But i persevered and finally got to Chapter Four, in which  Harry finds out just who and what he is and his dead parents were and  receives his invitation to attend Hogwarts School, the premier school of  magic in the World. From there on it's a pretty straightforward Term story,  except that the main subject at THIS school is Magic. Harry makes friends,  makes enemies, becomes a star on his House's Quidditch team and deduces  that one of the Masters is Up To No Good and Must Be Thwarted.<br />I sort of  wonder if the author didn't experience the Mimieux Effect -- i read that  when George Pal began filming &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, Yvette Mimieux  was ((actually)) slightly underage and had never acted in movies before. By  the time they finished making the film, they had to go back and reshoot  several of her early scenes, because she'd learnt so much about acting in  the course of the shoot -- since i understand she is a young single mother  who began writing this on scraps of paper in London(?)  coffeehouses.<br />However, Harry and his friends are fun in the Term  sequences, and the quest he and two others undertake is sufficiently  interesting that it carried me straight along to the end and left me  deciding i WILL read the next one -- even if the quest's working-out DID  remind me of quest-fantasy computer game...<br />For those who have read the  books of DIana Wynne Jones -- particularly the &quot;Chrestomanci&quot;  books, which have similar themes to the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books, the  comparison between Jones and Rowling is natural; i would definitely  recommend Jones's books to anyone who has enjoyed the &quot;Harry  Potter&quot; volumes.<br />A point of irritation is that the American  publisher apparently feels that those of us in the USA are not sufficiently  intelligent or well-educated to understand some things, and has made  changes in the text for the US edition -- up to and including changing the  title; the &quot;real&quot; title is &quot;...and the Philosopher's  Stone&quot;.  I strongly suspect that there have been changes in the text  as well in this book and in &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;... i haven't  read the other two to check yet.Pal began filming &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, Yvette Mimieux  was ((actually)) slightly underage and had never acted in movies before.

When i first read &quot;Lord of the Isles&quot;, first book in this  series, i was convinced that Drake had decided to see if he could  out-Jordan Robert Jordan.<br />And there are some similarities.<br />But Drake  has a more mordant approach and wit than Jordan, and isn't afraid to have a  little fun with the conventions of the quest-fantasy genre... and he  does.<br />As before, he takes his core group of adventurers -- Garric,  Cashel, Ilna, Sharina, Tenoctris and company -- and sends them by ones and  twos on separate quests of hair-raising difficulty and (in many cases)  grusomeness.  But all of them (even the grim and apparently humorless Ilna)  find occasional causes for humor, gallows-style or otherwise, and for  moments of beauty and happiness among the violence and dangers.<br />Of the  bunch, i'd say that Ilna -- who's had the hardest life of the adventurers  so far -- ends up the best off in terms of Good Stuff accumulated in her  quest.<br />The various quests -- Cashel's to find the sorcerously-abducted  Sharina, Ilna's to find a way home after being marooned with companions,  Garric and Tenoctris's to lay to rest a magical menace to the Kingdom if  the Isles -- all SEEM unrelated, and have a habit of suddenly turning into  something other than we thought they were, but looks can be deceiving in  this sort of fiction, and the grand finale when Everything (almost) Is  Revealed is quite satisfactory.<br />I want to make it clear that following is  a High Compliment from me, reading this story was in many ways like playing  one of the best-constructed of the old text-only computer games; everything  dovetails nicely, and an apparently-unimportant action taken or not taken  on one quest may have a huge effect on all of the other players' efforts,  and one important clue missed anywhere could mean ultimate and horrible  failure.	2000-08-11

Among the more interesting elements are  a couple of searches for types of things Jo Beth has never asked her dogs  to find before, some rather intense interaction with the denizens of the  swamps, and a few nicely-drawn vignettes of the dogs in action.<br />But the  unmasking of the old lady's murderer is both by-the-numbers drudge work not  at all involving the dogs and not very interesting.<br />Add in a  deus-ex-machina last-minute solution to major plot elements that comes out  of left field, and you get the weakest entry in the series.<br />But still  worth reading, if only for the bloodhounds, and for watching Jo Beth shoot  down a couple of overbearing authority figures -- and because there *are*  elements in this story that will forever change the future of Jo Beth, a  couple of the other recurring characters and of the series overall.<br />I  note at least one other reviewer complains about the copy-editing; i'd  guess this book was proofed by spell-checker, because several places words  in the text, while perfectly spelt, are simply the wrong words -- one that  sticks in my head is &quot;purpose&quot; where &quot;propose&quot; is  clearly meant.  And someone who doesn't understand the rules of useage is  responsible for putting &quot;Jasmine and I&quot; in at least one place  where &quot;Jasmine and me&quot; would be correct.<br />Another complaint i  have (which applies to the whole series) is that while Lanier lives in the  South, she still misses subtlties of Southern speech -- several times, she  has characters who say &quot;you-all&quot; (or however she's spelling it)  when speaking to a single person.  Not the way it usually works.  There are  a couple of other places where the speech patterns grate a bit.<br />All of  that aside, this is a book that devotees of the series will want to read,  no matter what, as it contains things they need to know.

He never seems to get the respect he  deserves; his stuff sells well but he never seems to &quot;break out&quot;  the way others (who may or may not be better writers) have and continue to  do.<br />And this may well have been Glen's best book so far.<br />Sad it's been  out of print since its single first edition, more than ten years ago.<br />I  recall buying it, because i buy every Glen Cook novel that comes out, and  reading it in basically one sitting (and even though i read nearly 1000  words/minute, that was a longish read, because this is a *big* book).  Not  too long after that, as we were setting out on a seven-hour drive (to an SF  convention, as it happens) my wife asked me if i had anything interesting  she could read on the trip.  I handed her &quot;Dragon&quot;.  She  protested that she didn't like Cook's stuff.  I persuaded her to try  it.<br />As we were arriving in Louisville, she looked up and said &quot;Okay  -- when can I read the sequel?&quot;<br />But there isn't a sequel.  It's  wide-open for a sequel.  The last line almost *demands* a sequel.<br />But  Glen won't write one. And i've bugged him about it on and off at SF  conventions for years -- he just grins and says &quot;Don't feel like  it&quot; or words to that effect.<br />But, even given the fact that this book  really *needs* a sequel and there isn't one and there apparently ain't  gonna *be* one, i cannot recommend it too highly as a classic example of  how to do space-opera *right*.<br />Would be well-worth the effort of finding  a copy if you like well-written, well-thought-out extremely wide-screen  Space Opera; particularly, anyone who likes either David Weber's  &quot;Honor Harrington&quot; series or &quot;Doc&quot; Smith's  &quot;Lensman&quot; books needs to read this.	2000-08-04

Diana Wynne Jones may well be the best-kept secret in children's and YA fantasy in this country, and that is a crying shame, especially in the light of the success of the Harry Potter boks, which are very similar to  DWJ's books, but not (to my taste) as good.<br />Here she starts out with what  almost seems a standard fairy-tale situation -- three beautiful (more or  less) sisters left in the care of their (not particularly wicked)  stepmother.  They live in a village in a land where everyone knows what  happens to each of three sisters who set out to seek their fortunes in the  world, and Sopihe, the eldest of the three, has no desire to experience  it.<br />So, as one sister is apprenticed to a tavern owner, and one to a  witch, Sophie stays behind in the family hat store and makes hats.  Her  hats soon become something of a rage, and all is doing well until the local  Wicked Witch drops by, says a few things that don't make any sense (at that  point) and casts a spell on Sophie.  One which makes her old and prevents  her from taling anyone who she is or what's happened to her.<br />And so  Sophie DOES set out to find her fortune (more or less), and winds up  knocking on the door of the Moving Castle of the title -- which belongs to  Howl the wizard.<br />&quot;Heartless&quot; Howl, who is said to charm young  ladies and then eat their hearts.<br />Who, of course, turns out to be both  everything and nothing that Sophie had expected.<br />And she meets Howl's  apprentice and his captive fire demon, with whom she makes a  bargain...<br />Ths is a book to read and read again and read some more, just  to savour the tasty bits.  You almost have to read it the second time --  which is not at all difficult to do -- because you have to go back and see  how the bits you thought meant one thing actually meant something  completely different.<br />Magic and love and adventure and betrayal and  rescues and slapstick comedy and truth and lies and Just Plain Fun...

I notice that some readers feel that dropping back to the time of &quot;The Beekeper's Apprentice&quot; for this fifth book, rather than continuing in chronological order may have been a mistake.  Personally, i  don't.<br />If nothing else, it gives King a chance to establish Russell's  feelings toward her background and her heritage as a young Jewish woman in  the period just after World War 1, as she travels through the Holy Land.  It gives her a chance to again depict and to clarify the early relationship  of Holmes and Russell, and to show us the beginnings of the change in that  relationship.<br />And it gives an excuse to write a grand, old-fashioned but  quite &quot;modern&quot; adventure novel -- exotic places!  Strange  customs! Assassins in the night! Plots and counter-plots! Hair's-breadth  escapes!  It's all there.<br />Needing to lay low ofr a while, Holmes and  Russell accept a request from brother Mycroft Holmes and head out to the  Holy Land, newly-conquered by the British under Allenby, and to discover  just what is going on.<br />Accompanied by a pair of alleged Arab allies, Ali  and Mahmoud (there's something just a bit too good to be true about these  fellows...), Holmes and Russell begin their investigation.  And the plot  that they discover -- and find themselves called to thwart at the last  instant -- is one to rival or even surpass Guy Fawkes's Gunposder Plot in  the scale of consequences.  Fawkes, after all, was only looking to blow up  Parliament; this plot strikes at government, clergy and some of the world's  holiest sites simultaneously.<br />As would be expected from Laurie King,  though there are some *very* funny moments -- the dinner at the American  Colony in Jerusalem, with Russell and Holmes, both in disguise, acting the  parts of complete strangers, for instance. (Holmes chooses the alias  &quot;William Gillette&quot; for this...)<br />But there are some dark  moments, indeed -- Mary's loss of family in a car crash is vividly  recalled, Holmes is tortured, several killings take place -- staged in a  manner to stimulate unrest/rebellion.<br />But in the end, of course, our  heroes *do* save the day.<br />As musch as anything, this book is a set-up for  the next to come, in which i understand that Homes and Russell return to  the Holy Land; by teaching Russell what she needs to operate undercover  there in this story, she avoids the necessity to slow down the next.recalled, Holmes is tortured, several killings take place -- staged in a  manner to stimulate unrest/rebellion.<br />But in the end, of course, our  heroes *do* save the day.<br />As musch as anything, this book is a set-up for  the next to come, in which i understand that Homes and Russell return to  the Holy Land; by teaching Russell what she needs to operate undercover  there in this story, she avoids the necessity to slow down the next.	2000-06-27

The &#34;Adventures&#34;  books may well be the freshest and most original takes on the Batman and  his friends and foes that i have read in many a year.<br /><br />But why? i asked  myself, and myself answered, Because they can use whatever they want from the  Batman's 50-year history, but they aren't stuck with a strait-jacket continuity that that 50 years imposes on the &#34;real&#34; Batman  titles.<br /><br />And so we come to Harley Quinn -- though they're trying to put  her in the &#34;real&#34; Batman continuity lately, which i think is a  BAD mistake, Harley is very much a creature of the animated show -- the  Joker's prankish and ditzy henchgrrl, a wise-cracking foil for both the  Joker and the Bat, cute and funny and deadly and frightening if you really  look.<br /><br />In fact, Harley Quinn may be more frightening than the Joker  himself, and *that* is a good trick.<br /><br />And why?  Because she *loves* Joker  and just wants to please him.  And to please a murderous, psychopathic clown, you have to be even crazier than he is.<br /><br />This book, then, is  Harley's story.  It tells us who she was, what she wanted to be, and how  she became what she *is*.<br /><br />It is a curiously gentle and sad story, as  well, considering the violence of many of its events and the madness  giggling from its pages in every panel.  Harley is rather a sad clown at  base; the thing she wanted that caused her to kick over the traces and turn  to crime -- Joker's love and approval -- is the one thing she will never  have, no matter how desperately she tries to please him, because there's  room for only one love object in Joker's life... the Batman, no matter how  twisted that love's expression may be.<br /><br />Watching Harley cold-bloodedly  attempting  to commit an elaborate and nasty murder, just so Joker will  notice her, is chilling.  Watching Batman manipulate both Harley and Joker, even with his hands tied, is an example of what makes the Batman the icon that he is.<br /><br />And reading Harley's final line*, which echo the saddest sickest of  the old Goffin & King Brill Building songs, is sad and horrifying and  ominous all at once.<br /><br />If you are a Batman fan but have not yet discovered  the &#34;Adventures&#34; books or even the animated series, this graphic  novel is a good place to start.<br /><br />And i envy you.<br /><br />========<br /><br />* I originally said &#34;final words&#34;, which gave, i decided on re-reading it several years later, the wrong impression...ill  notice her, is chilling.  Watching Batman manipulate both Harley and Joker, even with his hands tied, is an example of what makes the Batman the icon that he is.    And reading Harley's final words, which echo the saddest sickest of  the old Goffin & King Brill Building songs, is sad and horrifying and  ominous all at once.    If you are a Batman fan but have not yet discovered  the \\"Adventures\\" books or even the animated series, this graphic  novel is a good place to start.    And i envy you.	2000-06-24

She sees both sides of many issues, and, while  making her own positions clear, does not necessarily demonise those who  hold other views.  Pity them, sometimes, but not demonise them.<br />This book  picks up immediately after virtually the entire cast have moved to the  suburbs, bought houses, or acquired new roommates.

Their interactions with their  corporate-attorney neighbour, his uptight wife and their son, who is  Raffi's age and curious, make for some amusing and frustrating  moments...<br />And so on.<br />In this collection, tha author deals with  jealousy, unfaithfulness, a daughter's hurt that her widowed father is  beginning to date, a formerly all-female, all-lesbian household's difficult  adjustment to one of its members having a live-in boyfriend(!), financial  irresponsibility, many social issues, crabgrass and many many more topics.

On the other hand, though his emotional states are (or appear), much more intense than Spenser's, he mostly doesn't wax quite so lugubrious and elaborately on about it, though this may be mostly because he is presented third-person rather than as first-person narrator.<br />These minor caveats aside, this book (and, even more, the sequel, &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot;) is highly recommended, especially for whose reading diet lacks a little something tough to chew on lately.<br />Recommended whole-heartedly.hanics of the actual plot a bit strained and creaky (which explains the 3-star rating given how much i enjoyed the book on first reading) -- but the plot isn't really important, in the last analysis; what IS important is Jesse's beginnings on a journey that will being him back to being a complete man and a complete cop, and THAT doesn't creak at all.<br />Experienced Parker readers, be warned: Jesse Stone, like Spenser with Susan Silverman, carries a lot of emotional baggage and hang-ups regarding his ex-wife (which she reciprocates.

Whether or not you like it, most of the fantasy published these days is more-or-less directly derivative of Tolkein... unless it's Dark Fantasy, and then Stephen King is a common prototype.<br /><br />Well, meet Dave  Duncan.<br /><br />Dave Duncan plays by Dave Duncan's rules.<br /><br />The only other  book/series that i can recall that gave me as much fun watching an entirely  new (to me, anyway) system and practise of magic revealed just at the right  pace to move the story along quickly but not bog it down in Expository  Lumps was Edward Eager's \\"Half Magic\\" and its sequels/related  books (which you ought to check out, too).<br /><br />Duncan's system of magic for  this series (which i won't go into detail about because, while it's  imminently understandable and elegantly simple, the gradual revelation of  its elegant simplicity and power is part of the appeal of these books) is  one of those \\"why didn't *I* think of something like that? \\"  ideas.<br /><br />While this magical system and the implications of its working are  the major driving engine of the series as a whole, the driving engine of  the story that makes it wonderful and compellingly readable is the  relationship between Rap and Inos -- the stableboy and the beautiful  princess.  I've never before seen a better or more touching portrayal of  two young people so deeply in love with each other and yet so totally  clueless as to what they think themselves, much what the other thinks.<br /><br />On the other hand, i've read very few adventure romps that satisfy so  thoroughly as this series, either.<br /><br />Duncan has obviously put a lot of  effort into working out his world of Pandemia (this becomes even more  obvious in the sequel series, \\"A Handful of Men\\"), its races, its  politics and its geography.  And we see a *lot* of that geography in the  course of this series -- these books will gove you saddle sores and  blisters on your feet  just to read.<br /><br />Even beyond the nations and the  countries and the politics, Duncan has assembled a cast -- a veritable  horde -- of characters, almost all of whom seem to be concerned in some way  or other with stableboy Rap and Princess (of a Very Small city-state)  inosolan.  Particularly interesting and Important are the goblin Little  Chicken, the minstrel Jalon, Dr Sagorn the scholar, Darad, and Andor the  cavalier, not to mention various Gods who take a direct and meddlesome  interest in human affairs...<br /><br />Admittedly, this book starts a bit slowly,  but that's just Duncan winding up all the clockwork, setting all the  dominoes in their rows and getting the pyrotechnic displays set up Just  Right.<br /><br />If you read as far as Page 100 or so -- the introduction of Darad  is, i think, the turning point -- i do not think you will be able to put  this book and its three companions down until the last page of Volume  Four.<br /><br />((I would also like to praise the beautiful covers by Don Maitz --  i saw the originals of two of them at the 1991 World SF Convention -- which  are Simply Beautiful, and which, although on the surface simply four  portraits of the same girl/young woman, all clearly relate to and comment  on the action of the books they grace.

As a matter of fact, he was neither elderly nor English -- but  that's the type of material he excelled at; that somewhat macabre but  utterly devastating straight-faced black humour that seems to a Mere  Colonial such as myself as Utterly British.<br />One could, for instance,  question whether the untimely demise of twenty-six children -- in  alphabetical order, with lovingly-rendered illustrations of their  antepenultimate moments -- was a fit subject for humour.  Whether or not it  is becomes a moot question almost as soon as one begins reading &quot;The  Gashleycrumb Tinies&quot; -- &quot;'A' is for ANNA, who fell down the  stairs.  'B' is for BASIL, assaulted by Bears...&quot;  Sick or not, if you  can read all twenty-six pages of this little monograph and not laugh, there  is something wrong with you.<br />Possibly the best thing in the book --  though it's *all* excellent -- is &quot;The Unstrung Harp, or, Mr Earbrass  Writes a Novel&quot;, which has been described by an acquaintance who works  as an editor at a major New York publisher as one of the more accurate  portrayals of the process he has ever read.  {Horrifyingly so, i inferred  from his comments.}<br />Rather gentler and more restrained and cultured than  the work of Gahan Wilson, a bit less anarchic than &quot;The Far  Side&quot;, this is still a wonderful antidote to all of society's little  hypocrisies and refusals to face the reality of the gleeful darkness that  every one of us has (generally fairly well hidden) somewhere in our soul.nd refusals to face the reality of the gleeful darkness that  every one of us has (generally fairly well hidden) somewhere in our soul.	2000-05-11

Like other SF authors of the era (particularly Andre Norton), Heinlein realised that the audience he was aiming at would, aside from being younger than the  audience he reached through magazines like &quot;Astounding&quot;, be just  about as literate and as quick to accept and comprehend new ideas as the  audience for his &quot;adul&quot; works.<br />So, like Norton (and Edward  Eager, to mention another) his sole concessions to the &quot;juvenile&quot;  nature of the market were the age of his protagonists and a tendency to  slightly less complex language -- not writing down, just speaking a bit  more plainly.  He assumed that his audience would be familiar with things  that, perhaps, the general audience would not -- the discussions of the  implications for a &quot;truck&quot; of negative-lift streamlining and an  anti-gravity field that varies by an inverse-cube law in this book are a  classic example of that.<br />The story here, of a young man's passage into  adulthood, is one that Heinlein has told many times in many guises, but i  think that this may be the most poignant (except possibly for the  relativity-separated twins of &quot;Time for the Stars&quot;), as Max Jones  must be, essentially, orphaned twice along the way to that  maturity.<br />Heinlein postulates a time when unions/guilds so totally  control work qualifications that if you're not a guild member, you can't  work.  Max Jones, whose father has died, has nothing more to look forward  to than a life on a back-country farm with  his mother and her jerk of a  new husband.  That is -- he has nothing to look forward to unless he can  persuade the Astrogators' Guild, of which his uncle was a member, to accept  him as an apprentice.<br />Taking his uncle's working manuals, Max sets out to  hitch-hike to Guild HQ and sign up.<br />Of course, that doesn't work -- along  the way he meets Sam -- the only name he'll give -- who attempts to, in  essence, steal Max's identity and get himself appointed a Guild Apprentice.  But the Guild will accept neither.<br />So Sam -- convincing Max that he  wants to get off Earth just as badly as Max does and that, with his  connections and Max's money (a legacy from his uncle via the Guild), they  can get faked papers and get into space.  And they do -- as members of the  Stewards' Guild.<br />To this point, a description of the book reads like a  lot of other formula juvenile adventure books; but it's the details woven  into the story that make the difference -- like the story Sam tells  casually about this fellow he knew who wound up accidentally deserting the  Imperial Marines...  a story that sounds a lot like a first person  narrative, though Sam denies it.<br />By a series of unforeseen events, Max is  allowed to become an astrogator after all, becomes an officer, and  eventually he is the *only* astrogator surviving after a  seemingly-hospitable planet upon which the ship lands turns  hostile...<br />But he and one of the passengers have been taken prisoner by  the nasty centauroids who rule the world...<br />Max Jones is a brave young  man who does all that is asked of him and answers the call whenever he is  needed.  His friend Sam is a probable deserter, a card cheat, a con man and  a brawler.<br />It's Sam, the man who &quot;...ate what was set before  him&quot; that you will remember forever after you read this book.to, in  essence, steal Max's identity and get himself appointed a Guild Apprentice.

Let's say you (or a Young Person of your acquaintance) have finished all the Harry Potter books.<br />After which you read &quot;Half Magic&quot; and its sequels.<br />And then you did all five of Lloyd Alexander's  &quot;Prydain&quot; books.<br />And now, though those were very good indeed,  you want something aimed at a just slightly older audience, though not  necessarily with graphic bloody violence and panting sex scenes.<br />Well,  you've come to the right place -- i have just the thing, my friend.  Step  right up and cast your eyes on this little beauty.<br />While somewhat  derivative in detail (but what modern fantasy isn't at least a little  derivative somewhere?), the elements are stirred nicely into a fairly  original story line that avoids the pitfalls of following your examples too  closely with nothing new to say that we see all too often in first novels,  while still telling a briskly-moving story that the casual reader will have  no trouble following but that will not insult the intelligence of a  somewhat more analytical reader.<br />Familiar elements:<br />(1) The elite  messenger/diplomatic/spy cadre, the King's Riders, who wear  distinctively-coloured outfits (green in this case).<br />(2) The young person  of Good Family who has, thru impetuosity and rash disregard of consequence,  gotten into some minor scrape that seems to loom huge in her life.<br />(3)The  scheming nobleman with the Pretender to the Throne in hand who plots  against the Crown.<br />(4) The mysterious grey-cloaked figure who appears to  aid the Villains, but actually has Plans Of His Own.<br />And So  On.<br />Subversions of Familiar Elements:<br />(1) &amp; (2) The young person of  Good Family encounters a dying Rider in the wood; he passes on his horse,  sword, Rider brooch and his message to her, makes her swear to carry out  the mission, then dies, leaving her stuck.<br />(3) He's not as smart as he  thinks.<br />(4) By some clever footwork early in the story (at least, i  *hope* it was intentional) the author diverts attention longer than i might  have thought possible.<br />Oddly enough, while i certainly caught echoes of  Lackey's Heralds in the Green Riders, Tolkien's (and most everyone else's)  elves in the Eletians and so on, the author i most found myself thinking of  a lot of the time was vintage Andre Norton -- the plucky young (wo)man who  suddenly finds herself the focus of Great Events, gradually discovering in  himself abilities (s)he never knew (s)he posessed, generally involving some  innocent seeming but puissant object or device that comes into her  posession apparently innocently...<br />I must say that my favourite part of  the book is fairly early on, when Karigan finds herself taken in and  succored by the Misses Berry at their family home, Seven Chimneys (which  has nine).  Misses Bay and Bunch look and sound like slightly dotty old  ladies like your favourite old-maid aunt, but i strongly suspect that  future volumes (which i hope to see) may well reveal that they're something  a bit more.<br />An excellent light fantasy read; i'd give it about a PG  rating -- there are two brief sequences in which rape is obviously  intended, but both are short and non-specific; and while violence  (including some rather nasty but not too detailed magical violence) is an  essential part of such a story, it is handled well and is not lovingly  dwelt-upon in detail.<br />If you like Tolkien, Lackey, Eddings or Dave Duncan  (particularly his &quot;Man of His Word&quot; series; though Karigan is  nothing like Rap, there is some of the same sense of see-it-through because  it's the Right Thing To Do about her adventures), you need to at least give  thei ons a look., i  *hope* it was intentional) the author diverts attention longer than i might  have thought possible.<br />Oddly enough, while i certainly caught echoes of  Lackey's Heralds in the Green Riders, Tolkien's (and most everyone else's)  elves in the Eletians and so on, the author i most found myself thinking of  a lot of the time was vintage Andre Norton -- the plucky young (wo)man who  suddenly finds herself the focus of Great Events, gradually discovering in  himself abilities (s)he never knew (s)he posessed, generally involving some  innocent seeming but puissant object or device that comes into her  posession apparently innocently...<br />I must say that my favourite part of  the book is fairly early on, when Karigan finds herself taken in and  succored by the Misses Berry at their family home, Seven Chimneys (which  has nine).

Why did *we* deserve to come  home when so many others didn't make it?  That question alone has been  enough to break some people of our generation, and it's only a part of what  preys on Moody.On the other hand, the cab-driver PI bit, for some reason,  even with only two that i know of in the current field, still seems  over-crowded, and i'm not sure why.  Certainly, Moody is about as different  from Carlotta Carlyle as it's possible to get, but one feels right and the  other seems a bit forced and i can't say why.But it's a good, solid fast  read for all that, and well worth your while.	2000-05-06

I'll even go so far as to say that some readers (of whom  i'm not one) may feel that he really hjasn't completed the story.  But he  has -- the solution is complete and elegant in Spenser's head, and he knows  the guilty will sooner or later suffer...<br />One odd element in this book is  that a completely-unrelated short story (set in Boston), with unrelated  characters, is spliced into the middle of the book.<br />Parker has Susan  refer to the events in this short story in a rather forced-sounding attempt  to make it fit in by having her explain something about the main story by  referring to the events of the interlude...  But it really doesn't  work.<br />OTOH, it's a neat little vignette of Spenser at work, deciding  where justice lies and then going ahead and facilitating Justice with  little regard for law, legality or the feelings of his client.<br />One minor  gripe -- As in &quot;Paper Doll&quot; (set in an equally fictitious South  Carolina county that Spenser briefly visits again in &quot;Hugger  Mugger&quot;), Parker has missed a minor piece of Southrun talk -- we  don't, generally, refer to Interstate highways as, say, &quot;Route  20&quot; -- such a reference is usually reserved for some piddly little  State Highway; two-lane blacktop winding thru god-knows-where in the  less-populated end of the county.<br />Don't know why that bothers me, except  it's so obvious, as if Spenser were in Louisiana and referred to the  &quot;County Jail&quot;...<br />Highly recommended, despite my personal dialog  twitches.gripe -- As in &quot;Paper Doll&quot; (set in an equally fictitious South  Carolina county that Spenser briefly visits again in &quot;Hugger  Mugger&quot;), Parker has missed a minor piece of Southrun talk -- we  don't, generally, refer to Interstate highways as, say, &quot;Route  20&quot; -- such a reference is usually reserved for some piddly little  State Highway; two-lane blacktop winding thru god-knows-where in the  less-populated end of the county.<br />Don't know why that bothers me, except  it's so obvious, as if Spenser were in Louisiana and referred to the  &quot;County Jail&quot;...<br />Highly recommended, despite my personal dialog  twitches.	2000-04-06

Of course, this is not what happens --  and thereby hang four stars worth of reading enjoyment.<br />From his  accidental but most enjoyable encounter with London showgirl Pip, to his  accidental but portentous encounter with a distinguished gentleman in the  country who, despite his incognito, has a rather royal manner, through his  brushes with Fraser's charming rotter, the elderly but still randy Harry  Flashman (the young Churchill runs a bit shy of Sir Harry) and a  hair-raising reminder of his past in America, Mr Franklin takes it all in  stride, with a slightly bewildered interest...<br />It takes love to disturb  him sufficiently that he will take decisive action.<br />An action that will  be silhouetted against the backdrop of the beginning of World War One and  its time.<br />This is not the rollicking romp that the Flashman books are,  nor is it the cheerful, sometimes touching military fiction of &quot;The  General Danced at Dawn&quot; and Fraser's other &quot;Dand McNeill&quot;  stories...  But it is a picture of a fascinating time and place that seems  so recent in some ways and so long ago in others, a picture that helps to  open and illuminate that time and place for the modern reader as, slowly  but surely, it slips from living memory into &quot;recent history&quot;,  about which, if, as has been said,  &quot;the past is a different  country&quot;, one can say that recent history is a foreign contry that  lies just outside our own borders.<br />And, as when one visits such  deceptively familiar but ultimately foreign places, one is advised to  engage the services of a reliable native guide and translator to get the  maximum enjoyment out of your visit.

This book literally changed my life.<br />In the eleventh grade in Greenville, South Carolina, i had an English teacher who designated Thursday as \\"Free Reading Day\\" and encouraged the entire class to read anything they wanted to (well, within limits -- \\"Playboy\\" would have been Right Out, i'm sure.) -- and, in case you had nothing of  your own, she laid out an assortment of magazines and books on a table at  the front of the room.<br /><br />On that table, one Thursday, was a copy of  \\"The Cruel Sea\\".  Since i've always been at least a bit  interested in sea stories, and it looked interesting, i picked it up.  From  the first i was hooked solidly.<br /><br />In the next three or so years, i reread  it twice at least, possibly more than that.<br /><br />And then i joined the Navy --  and i am sure that it was because of what i read in this book, and what i  sensed behind it, in what Monsarrat -- who, like his viewpoint character,  Lockhart, was there from the beginning, working his way up to command his  own ship before the end of the war -- didn't so much say as assume about  the sea and the Navy -- *any* Navy.<br /><br />Monsarrat presents us here with a  brotherhood of the sea, corny as that idea may sound.  Sailors, more than  the other Armed Forces, tend to regard other sailors -- even enemy sailors  -- as brothers in arms, and, as Monsarrat says, the only true enemy is the  cruel sea itself.<br />As he shows us here, the sailor who was your enemy five  minutes ago, who was trying to kill you as you tried to kill him, is merely  another survivor to be rescued from the cruel sea once you've sunk his  ship.<br /><br />And, even more so, as Monsarrat portrays it, there is a kind of  brotherhood that binds sailors in the same Navy together in very mcuh a  family manner -- you may not like your cousin, but you want to know what's  happening to him and, when all is said and done, he IS your relative.<br />The  best summation of this sort of attitude (which i felt to some extent myself  during my time in the US Navy) comes when Ericson, the Captain, is touring  his new ship as she stands under construction in a Glasgow shipyard; he  meets one of his future officers, and mentions the name of his previous  ship, which was lost with over three-quarters of her crew, and realises  that\\"<br /><br />\\"He's heard about 'Compass Rose', he probably remembers  the  exact details--that she went down in seven minutes,  that we lost eighty  men out of ninety-one. He knows all  about it, like everyone else in the  Navy, whether  they're in  destroyers in the Mediterranean or attached to  the base at  Scapa Flow: it's part of the linked feeling, part of the  fact  of family bereavement. Thousands of sailors felt personally  sad when they  read about her loss; Johnson was one of them,  though he'd never been  within a thousand miles of 'Compass Rose'  and had never heard her name  before.\\"<br /><br />To be part of a band of brothers like that is a proud  thing, and Monsarrat captures it perfectly.<br /><br />He also captures the  terrified boredom of being in enemy territory with nothing happening as you  wait for the enemy to make the first move, and the shock, confusion and  horror of combat (particularly sea combat, in which the battlefield itself  is the deadly, patient enemy of both sides).<br /><br />And he captures the glories  and rewards of life at sea, the beauty of a glorious clear dawn at sea, the  stars and the moon and the wake at night and so much more.<br /><br />This is the  book that made a sailor out of me.<br /><br />It will tell you what it is to be a  sailor.some extent myself  during my time in the US Navy) comes when Ericson, the Captain, is touring  his new ship as she stands under construction in a Glasgow shipyard; he  meets one of his future officers, and mentions the name of his previous  ship, which was lost with over three-quarters of her crew, and realises  that\\"<br /><br />\\"He's heard about 'Compass Rose', he probably remembers  the  exact details--that she went down in seven minutes,  that we lost eighty  men out of ninety-one.

And put it back down.<br />Some months later, nothing else on the  stands looking any better and much of it actively worse, i picked it  up.<br />A decent read -- moving into Steven King country -- unseen nasties in  squeeky-clean Middle American village, gifted child who doesn't really know  What Her Gift Is For, strange doings and nasty critters in the local park,  family secrets that are alluded to but never told to the girl, the mystery  of her own parentage and, last but far from leats, the advent of a  stranger, a tall somewhat grim man who supports his bad leg with a black  staff carved with Strange Symbols.<br />Fourteen old Nest Freemark knows that  she has magic like many of the Freemark Women have, and thet her magic is  tied up with the nastiness that lurks in the local park, which is watched  over by a sylvan named Pick.  &quot;Feders&quot;, nasty ectoplasmic  creatures that feed off human pain and despair live in the park... and  Something Even Nastier is imprisoned in a great oak near the park's center.

This is, in many ways, the best that David Drake has given us yet.<br />In a war not unlike the one in which Drake and i found ourselves a while back, an ad-hoc unit of odds and sods finds itself rolling hot to try to relieve  their employer's provincial capital.<br />While these are members of Hammer's  Slammers, the deadliest mercenary unit going, they are hardly the Slammers'  finest, ranging from maintenance personnel pressed into service as the crew  of a patched-up tank to their CO, Capt. Peggie Ranson, who is just this  side of a Section 8, and a civilian reporter, who accidentally winds up  along for the ride, who furnishes a viewpoint for the reader.<br />It is this  viewpoint (one of several from which Drake tells the story) that makes this  book, in my opinion, about Drake's best -- by giving us someone a lot like  ourselves, putting us inside his head then and putting him through an  accelerated version of the hardening process that produces a professional  soldier from a raw replacement, Drake shows us even more starkly than  usual, that war is, indeed hell.  And why.<br />Drake is not going to let us  get away from war without rubbing our noses in it; he wants the reader to  see soldiers as *people*, not expendables, like bullets.  He wants to show  people who haven't Seen The Elephant what war is, and to -- just maybe --  convince a few of us that War Is Not A Good Thing.<br />Reading this book can  be harrowing, as you watch men and women who are at least recogniseable and  often sympathetic characters kill and die.  If you can read it, watch those  characters fighting and dieing, and not find yourself in some sort of  emotional state as you read Chapter 13, which is a slightly-less-formal  version of a military arrival report of Task Force Ranson's arrival in the  capital, listing the few remaining vehicles and personnel that they rolled  with, then you have Not Been Listening.<br />&quot;...still i wonder why --  the worst of men must fight and the best of men must die...&quot;<br />One of  the absolutely most revealing looks at the military mind and what the  military actually *DOES* that i have ever read.best of men must die...&quot;<br />One of  the absolutely most revealing looks at the military mind and what the  military actually *DOES* that i have ever read.	2000-02-16

Of all the &#34;Swallows & Amazons&#34; books, this is the most compelling read -- it doesn't share the laid-back mood of most of the others, and the Walker children are in real danger, which is unusual for  the series (the nearest to such would be the &#34;Israelites&#34;  sequence {in &#34;Secret Water&#34;} or in &#34;Pigeon Post&#34; {in  the &#34;Moles&#34; or the fire sequence} all of which are important but  limited parts of the books).<br /><br />Visiting aboard the &#34;Goblin&#34;, the  yacht of a young man they had recently met, they find themselves adrift in  a fog, swept helplessly out into the North Sea as they drag (and lose)  anchor, and then running before a full North Sea gale, with no idea where  they are or where they are headed, and no certainty that they will not find  themselves sinking on shoals or run down by much larger ships (In a  particularly tense and thrilling sequence, just that almost happens,  averted at the last instant by ingenuity and level-headedness on the part  of Captain John.).<br /><br />Facing the dangers they discover, drawing on their  experience in sailing much smaller boats and on their own courage and  common sense, they succeed in keeping themselves and the &#34;Goblin&#34;  from harm, and even succeed in a mid-sea &#34;rescue&#34;.<br />And, in the  course of the adventure, John Walker (somewhere in his late teens, if i  calculate aright) makes a major part of the step from boy to young man,  learning valuable lessons about himself and what he is capable of, and  keeping himself and his sisters and brother safe through the long, stormy  night.<br /><br />This is children's adventure at its best, with action, comedy,  thrills and danger enough to satisfy almost any taste, but no violence,  gratuitous or otherwise.<br /><br />===============<br /><br />Huh.  I thought, all those years ago, that i had said that this would make a GREAT PG13 kid's adventure movie.<br /><br />It would.	2000-02-16

Sort of.  The pivotal Nieuw Frieslander in this particular sequence is the scary soldier i mentioned; i'm still not sure whether Drake has given us a literal reincarnation of the creepiest character he has ever created {and that is saying something...}.<br /><br />After reading this, you might want to hunt up Drake's collection \\"The Tank Lords\\", and read the novel contained therein, \\"Rolling Hot\\", for a look at the Slammers doing what they do best.	2000-02-16

David Drake turns away from his &quot;Hammer's Slammers&quot; universe and gives us a view of mercenaries fighting in a different milieu.<br />This is about my favourite of Drake's SF -- i'm not sure why, but it's a bit more  satisfying than some of his other work.<br />A mercenary regiment whose  Colonel has been assasinated, the crew of a damaged spaceship and a young  officer and two enlisted men from the regular army of the side employing  the mercenaries must band together and overcome hardships and dangers from  foe and friend alike.<br />A young man becomes truly an adult when command is  thrust upon him.<br />Great book.	2000-02-16

These three novels (A Conflict of Necesseties, Agent of Change, and Carpe Diem) have been favourites of mine ever since i first encoutnered them.<br />Long out of print, Meisha Merlin (headquartered here in Atlanta)  has done the SF world a real service by bringing them back into print in  this omnibus volume (and, as well, publishing the next volume in the  series. &quot;Plan B&quot;).<br />My favourite book of the three is  &quot;Conflict&quot; -- at least partly because i am a confirmed fan of the  Regency romances of Georgette Heyer; anyone familiar with those will find  delicious echoes resounding throughout this story.<br />My favourite  character, though, is Edger, the Clutch-Turtle ... a character who is  simply indescribable in the space of this short review but wonderful in the  extreme to watch in action.<br />And my favourite image is of an imaginary  Galactic Parcel Express package ... with imaginary dust on it.<br />Worth  every penny of the money and every minute of the wait if you order it.	2000-02-09
