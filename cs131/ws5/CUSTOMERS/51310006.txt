And you will enjoy the pictures in this book. <br /> <br />But while many books have little to offer after the pictures, Eisner gives you lively, first hand narratives on how he discovered many secrets to the private lives of insects.  <br /> <br />One of the first little mysteries Eisner discusses is how he developed his nose for benzoquinone detection at an early age and how he put it to good use in discovering how species of cockroaches use them for defense. <br /> <br />There are many such stories in this book that will be a delight to people who like to study insects. <br /> <br />	2005-08-10

I have to admit, my opinion of Mr. Buchanon has improved of late. I have been thinking that I have been the one to change politically, but Mr. Buchanon has summed up many of my concerns to show that really it is the Republican Party that has been doing the changing of late. Can you really compare the goings on of today with that of Reagan or Goldwater? I think not, and neither does Mr. Buchanon. It's not conservative, it is liberal with a different set of clients. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the parts of the book comparing the arc of our Republic with that of ancient Rome. He's not the first to do so, but he gives some interesting insights in the differences between the causes of the collapse of great civilizations and the symptoms. He also makes comparisons with the other civilazations that have come and gone. I think a good sense of history is what is lacking in many of the talking heads that try to comment on politics these days. <br /> <br />He has plenty to say, in the usual Buchanon style, but this time I think he deserves to be listened to.	2005-05-20

There are many writers predicting a variety of calamities, Kunstler is one of the few to speculate about what comes later. I don't think he is far off the mark on a lot of things. I think his predictions could be right with a far less disruptive loss of the oil commodity-- whether a real or artifically created scarcity. I don't think this country has the infrastructure in most large cities that it once had to be able to absorb such shocks. When is the last time you even heard a civil defense drill?     One other thing Kunstler's book gives you is some ideas and food for thought on what you can do to prepare your family for this not-to-unforseeable series of events.    I'm looking forward to hearing him on the Art Bell show tonight.	2005-05-08

Because they are so good, they probably convey the information better than a photo because the conditions for the clouds can be exact. When it comes to the cloud section, you might not even notice that they are drawings at first. <br /> <br />There is a lot of good information in this little book. It is divided into several sections: atmosphere, weather systems, clouds, precipitation, winds, optical and atmospheric phenomena, climate, and forecasting. When you look at the price, and if it is a topic you are interested, it is hard not to be please with it's purchase. It even has detailed information and a drawing of something called a Brockenspecter. I mean really, what more could you ask for from a little book under five dollars! <br /> <br />	2005-05-07

How Conservatives Won the Heart of America	Books	4	14	17	N	N	Raises interesting issues	The book raises interesting issues. But the big question I have is, why doesn't the Democratic party follow the obvious answer? Why don't Democrats address economic issues more favorable to the working class while following traditional cultural values. Example: Democrats supported the two right wing dragon-style bankruptcy squeezes, the one in 1998 which eliminated student loan bankruptcy as well as the current one which will require the poor to prove it with litigation. Both radical law changes would have been impossible with some Democrat backbone. Yet these examples of catering to the Republican core (rich persons still get to declare bankruptcy for their types of debt and keep their billion dollar houses,) went through with the cooperation of Democrats.     If it can be said that the Republicans are performing smoking mirror tricks with the economy by trotting out the old cultural divide-- why are Democrats going along with it? The Democrats gave us a choice between tweedle dee and tweedle dumber. One skull and bones member versus another! No wonder they lost. The Republican ads which featured Kerry changing his mind with the blowing of the wind were successful because they rang true-- not for missed subtle nuances. And I am hardly a member of the vast right wing conspiracy. Democrats need to stand up for something. The Reagan revolution won, because like him or not, Reagan meant something to people just as FDR meant something to people before him.     Is it impossible to give us a candidate who believes in progressive economics while being cognizant of middle America's social positions? \\"Abortions cheaper by the dozen\\" is as much as a silly sine qua non for the current Democrat leadership as \\"homosexuals are leading to teenage pregancy\\" is for the Republicans.  Why do Democrats play the game as loosers? Maybe because they have wanted to? They are cut from the same sails as the Republicans, and want the ship to come in-- for the upper class.     This book couldbe a wake up call or a death knell for the Democrat party. As I recall, the Republican party was pretty battered and bruised before it started getting its act together. If you count the number of years after the Nixon impeachment before Republicans regrouped and the number of years after the Clinton impeachment-- it probably won't be much longer before Democrats get going again.	2005-03-13

However, he misses the mark with the cause. People have lost the bright line distinction between a free market and mercantilism. When the government fosters certain larger endeavors at the expense of mom and pop stores it is NOT capitalism. We have government paying for new stadiums for billion dollar sports clubs. We have government finding excuses to take the property away from small stores to give it to chain stores. Chain stores are given taxpayer backed incentives to move into towns by local politicans who get campaign contributions. When corporations are allowed to easily file bankruptcy on 100s of millions of dollars of debt but we crack down on consumer bankruptcy and eliminate it entirely for student loans, it is clearly the disparity in treatment under the law that is the problem. On and on, the law is benefitting the enormous businesses at the expense of competition with the smaller endeavors and private consumer. These things are the antithesis of a free market, yet both parties practice it regularly, eagerly, and unpatriotically.	2005-03-13

They seem to be gimmicky efforts to evoke feelings in order to enhance a weak story. The children who read the Pfister book are meant to become envious over the glitter of the gold foil as were the other fishes. Furthermore, the book is also quite steeped in the dreaded didactics. The octopus directly instructs the Rainbow Fish in \\"correct\\" behavior. Why should the Rainbow fish give up pieces of his body that protect him, to these other fish  just so they will leave him alone? Some might be inclined to call this a Marxist philosophy incorrectly, but for the fact that the other little fish had no \\"need\\" for the Rainbow Fish's body parts. They simply wanted them. The worst human emotions should not be evoked in children's literature--at least not held out for modeling. Children should certainly not be encouraged to model conformity, greed, and buying friendship.	2005-02-11

A mysterious, pumpkin with a mouth appears in an old woman's room and declares that as soon as it gets teeth it will eat her. The old woman throws the pumpkin out but it comes back with more facial features. She throws it out again, but it soon reappears with even more facial features. Each time she throws the pumpkin out it comes back again with a new facial feature, until it finally has teeth. Mrs. McMurphy picks the pumpkin up and chops it into a pie. The effect of the changing illustrations for the pumpkin is to build suspense in the reader. It keeps the child interested enough to keep reading. Young children learn many things including a connection between parts of the face and senses, staying calm during a crisis, and that older women can be good role models.  <br /> <br />	2005-02-11

Their economy was incredibly strong and our's was not so swell. Movies like Black Rain and Rising Sun that displayed corruption in Japanese society were relished by the public at the time. <br /> <br />Now, in the introduction to the book, the author complains about students being too rowdy and undisciplined. Then he shifts to complaining about too much discipline, too many rules. He recounts numerous tales of harsh corporal punishment for minor infractions. How can mutually exclusive themes of too little discipline and too much discipline possibly be universal? <br /> <br />There is little if anything presented as positive about the Japanese school system from elementary to college. The book is clearly playing to an audience and lacks much that would imply any balance. A view is taken that Japanese schools are bad and anything that supported that view was included with nothing that discounted the view.  <br /> <br />I don't know-- the Japanese school system could theoretically consist of nothing but negative qualities. They could just put on shows of quality for visiting gaijin. However, this seems like a potential exageration to say the least. Although, I am sure there are many problems with bureaucratic intransigence, with abuse of corporal punishments, and with teenage rebellion, would millions of Japanese just live with it if it did not produce any positive results at all? <br /> <br />The major thesis that no system is a panacea is valid, but the execution is just as heavy handed as the Japanese schoolmaster's portrayal.	2004-10-07

They were great spectacles that were even looked forward to by the heathens back then. He would even organize sections of the hecklers in great, resounding, choruses of \\"for-ni-cation\\" and \\"lake-of-fire!\\" I believe he was even mentioned in an old edition of Rolling Stone for his notorious campus romps. I remember one wag who ranked evangelists on the length of their sylabification of the word \\"yeeeesssss\\" who considered brother Jed the tops. And then there was sister Cindy, too!     I first saw a Jed Smock experience well over 20+ years ago. I have noticed that the quality and numbers of the hecklers has decreased over the years. Once the hecklers would get into the act with some novel retort or another, but the last time I saw him about 5 years ago, the hecklers were far more obnoxious and lame brained than in the grand old days. Perhaps one could say they were even more abrasive than Mr. Smock himself. This style of evangelical oratory, whether you like it or not, is a vanishing art form of Americana in this slick television age. Jed Smock's operation hearkens back to the old days of Holy Hubert. I was just amazed to find out in a google search that the ol' Smock was still kicking after all these years.    Ah, free speach. It still lives without corporate sponsorship.	2004-10-03

Major educator textbooks are teaching teachers that they should make boys more feminine and that too much masculinity is not only a bad thing but dangerous! &quot;Of special concern are adolescent boys who adopt a strong masculine role,&quot; Educational Psychology, Santrock (isbn 0072855878) They literally advocate androgyny as the most desireable state of being. This is just one book, and should not be singled out, it is simply representative of the problem. I refer to that book to show that the professional reviewers who say this work is just alarmist are sticking their head in the sand.<br />Sommers is reporting the actual state of the art in education. If you have school age children, are a teacher rebelling against the system, or are just concerned about the future, you should carry this book as a source of information to fight the ivory towers. Because they will cite a tautological litany of researchers with straw men criticism. The Sommers book can be an intellectual shield against this form of what I find to be child abuse.	2004-06-21

(Or else they should adopt a constructivist view they love so much and let the student pick the book they want to use.)<br />2) The CD lessons had small fonts and/or a small frame that are hard to read. On many screens most of the page is taken up with the frames for the title of the book and useless links. Occasionaly there were text formatting problems. Also a handful of the questions had clearly wrong answers that need proofreading, eg. matching quiz #5 for chapter 1.<br />3) The textbook itself has a clearly Constructivist bias (which unfortunately totally dominates educational teaching these days.) The text effectively describes the various constructivist and post-constructivists positions in detail but gives very superficial treatment of their critics. A section on the articles published by Fox and other critics of exclusive collective learning, and relativism would have been better. Or better the work of Jan Adams-Byers which implies some problems with using constructivist approaches with non-traditional students.<br />4) Gratuitous male bashing. A whole section is devoted to seriously teaching little boys to be more like little girls. It teaches the material of those seriously advancing androgyny as the better state of being. I'm serious! &quot;Of special concern are adolescent boys who adopt a strong masculine role,&quot; Santrock. Of course, it also suggests that little girls should be more like little boys, but does not say whether or not they would then be of special concern.<br />5) In dealing with moral teaching, all theories present the idea that morality comes from people and is subjective. Accepting this is the advanced state, rejecting or not seeing it is childlike or immature. There were a few critics of the main proponents, but I saw no alternative to this basic tenet whatsoever.<br />Down with the trite, hip, over use of group work at the expense of individual learning! Hegelian dialectics are as passe as Soviet Style communism no matter how you dress them up. That's my opinion. You can have a different opinion, but in a book that is designed to teach teachers there should be room for showing that this is not the ne plus ultra of understanding and show why opponents feel this way with more than straw men.pting this is the advanced state, rejecting or not seeing it is childlike or immature.

Yes this puppy came out in about 1959. Before Zelanzy's Damnation Alley, before a lot of Harlan Ellison's stuff, before the first Dune even, there was Canticle. 1st let me say the edition I read years ago had an introduction by Norman Spinrad which contained many spoilers (gave away parts of the plot) so if the edition you buy has this intro, you may want to skip it.<br />This is also one of the most cerebral of the genre. The book takes place in the future after Nuclear Holocaust. It deals with an order of future monks in the American Southwest as they try to sort out elements of the ancient past (our era) amidst the backdrop of changing survival politics across several generations. <br />One of the things I found interesting about it was how it dealt with the archetypical mutants. Unlike most stories, it has a general moral sense of resposibility towards them-- at least the monks do. The church orders mutants to be taken care of until they reach adulthood. The church also shows concern for other survivors throughout the book-- which causes some points of antagonism.<br />Like other commentators, I note that organized religion is portrayed in this book as a little misguided, but generally well-meaning.<br />It may be a little dull reading for some, since much of the background has been presented many times in movies, but there is also a lot that is still refreshing today.	2001-03-09

This book historically demonstrates that minorities must have the ability to protect themselves from the tyranny of the majority. The story of the Deacons of Defence arming themselves against the trepidations of racists is inspirational. Object lessons for people of all races and creeds. Buy it. I hope this book never goes away.	2001-02-18

I've got several in this  series including the one for Chicago and I find it really makes you feel  like you've been there.

It's your job to make them  comfortable that you wont.&quot;<br />No duh! I didn't need a $30 book to tell  me that. I needed to find out what to do about this and the other problems  raised, but Arron leaves us hanging, stating what's obvious to everyone but  those who graduated from top tier law schools (and have no problems getting  whatever job they want) for nearly 400 pages.<BR><BR><br />The premise is  good, the execution is poor. I found the book to be full of bad IRACing but  would grade it a C for issue spotting and effort.	2000-08-03
