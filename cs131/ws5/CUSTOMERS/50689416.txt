The analysis of how advanced the Muslim culture was and why it stopped advancing and making significant discoveries post-1492 is the gem of this treatise.<br /><br />Bernard Lewis, a widely read British historian and a Near Eastern Studies Emeritus professor at Princeton University, has written over 20 books about the Muslim world and history of Islam.<br /><br />I would recommend this for anyone wanting to understand the historical context of the start of deterioration and decline of Muslim influence on world events, and the stagnation of Muslim technical and cultural advancements.<br /><br />The author's conclusion is that today's cultural divide between the West and the Islam world are grounded in the historical, cultural, and social developments of late 15th century.  This book offers very little if any religious theological analysis.	2005-04-11

The book seems to be a mixture between autobiography, race and course reviews, training advice and a little on diet.<br /><br />While not shy to brag about his accomplishments and ambitions, Dean balances these out with candid accounts of his mistakes, limitations, and struggles.<br /><br />This book is truly a great inspirational read from a great athlete.  I read the book in two afternoons and when I was finished I went out on a 3-hour run.  A great reminder of why I've always enjoyed running.	2005-04-11

Vollucci is a successfull seminar lecturer advancing his \\"Three Moves to a Million\\" method.  This \\"proven\\" method of \\"become a millionaire starting with just $6,000, and you can do it in only three moves, if these moves consist of investing in midsize apartment buildings\\" is only \\"proven\\" because the author benefited from favorable partnerships and a profitable rapidly upward moving real-estate market in the early 80s.  By writing this book, the author seems to be trying to amass more capital by being another \\"guru\\" on get-quick-rich circuit, and sell more books and seminars.<br /><br />The number (or lack of) of reviewers here at Amazon.com who became millionairs as a result of Mr. Vollucci's \\"proven\\" method can be an indicator to how prevalently and ubiquitously \\"proven\\" this \\"Three Moves to a Million\\" hypothetical method is.<br /><br />If you're interested in studying this investment avenue (apartment buildings) I would read the book at your local library (although the book goes into unnecessary details).  I would start off with a regular textbook on Real Estate Investment instead.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this is only one way of investing in real-estate and during times of adverse economic/social conditions (stagnating real-estate market value, lack of tenants, low occupancy numbers, etc.) this method will fail miserably.	2005-04-07

What really surprised me about this book was how the first few chapters were about the Land, Flora&Fauna, History, Government & Economy, and People of the island.  From these pages I learned more about the island and its people than your average Hawaiian sun-worshipping tourist.<br /><br />The book also offers lots of ideas and information for Sports & Entertainment, Shopping, Food and Drinks.  Each different area of the island is detailed with a map and minute details about the beaches.<br /><br />The book lacks the colorful touristy postcard pictures but makes up for it through the sheer amount of information (and good organization) for everyone, be they young or old, jocks or bums, artists or history-buffs, food-connoisseurs or Hawaiian-drink enthusiasts.<br /><br />Overall a great buy, and will use it on all future trips to O'ahu.<br /><br />NOTE: This book covers O'ahu island exclusively (and not any of the other 6 Hawaiian islands).  There is information on how to reach the other islands though, but nothing beyond that.	2005-04-07

Very Indispensable for Neophytes and Experienced Landlords	If you're in the real estate rental business in the state of California you need this book to start out, survive, and thrive in this business.  The NOLO books are written by lawyers for lay people.<br /><br />The \\"California Landlord's Law Book: Rights and Responsibilities\\" covers all ground and gives you more than a legal or business understanding of real estate rental (rare but detrimental scenarios and important topics are discussed, such as Discrimination, Self-Help Evictions, Landlord's Liabilities for Dangerous Conditions and Criminal Acts, etc.)<br /><br />This law book also contains all the forms you will need, both at the end as apendix and on a CD.  The book is very thorough and every new edition stays abreast with the latest rental law changes in California.  The only downside (unavoidable) is that every so often NOLO publishes a new edition thus somewhat outdaing previous ones.	2005-04-07

The analysis is a result of over 15 years of data accumulation and academic analysis.<br /><br />I was first introduced to the book in 1999 when I had to read it as a required text for a Personal Finance class at the University of California at Davis.  The second read, years later, was just as fresh, enlightnening, and captivating as the first.  Now I own the book on CD (which is a truncated version of the book, unfortunatelly :-( )<br /><br />The two academic authors do an excellent job at condensing their study field and interview results, and outlining in clear English the traits of the wealthiest people in the US.  Each chapter talks about a different topic.  The topics range from how millionaires became such, to how they raise their kids, to what kind of cars they drive.  I was suprised to learn some cool and interesting facts.  For example, the most popular cars (inadvertently) are the ones with the lowest rate of cost per weight.<br /><br />I cannot sing this book's praises enough. This book deserves a 5+ stars.  Enjoy the read!<br /><br />Good job Danko and Stanley.	2005-03-23

Unlike other guides Rough Guides does not cater to any particular demographic age group or particular budget standards.  Not to mention that the writers are experienced travel writers and have extensive experience in Romania and region.<br /><br />About this being a travel book to Romania:<br /><br />The organization of the book, the writing style makes you want to actually visit the country and experience it.  Very informative historically and regionally, without being overbearing.  Also very ecclective with regards to things to do and see: historical sights, cultural events, activities, culinary, nature wonders.<br /><br />Having been born in Romania and having spent the first half of my life under the Ceaucescu regime, I find this book a refreshing reminder of all the wonderful sights that I have only seen or read in books and finally been able to see and experience in person.  This country has a rich historical heritage, a complex mix of minorities, and a tumultous past.  Everytime I visit Romania I discover something new, enigmatic, and idyllic.  This guide has definitely been a helpful tool towards enjoying my re-discovery of Romania.	2005-03-22

The book is written by an insider and even a former high ranking member in the echelon of the \\"Watchtower and Bible Tract Society\\" headquartered in Brooklyn NY.<br /><br />This book is an EYE-OPENER into the workings, decision-making, politics, theocratic yet absolutist life of this organization (fondly called by members as \\"the Society\\").  There are ample document copies presented to back up the life-stories of former Governing Body Member Raymond Franz.<br /><br />While the writing style is one of non-judgemental, thoughtful, and caring spirit, the long book can become quite a dry account of various events within the Jehovah's Witnesses organization.<br /><br />Non-Jehovah's Witnesses not familiar with the theocratic lingo and organizational structure of the Watchtower Society may find this read dry, boring, and non-climatic.<br /><br />For the Jehovah's Witnesses who are \\"active\\", \\"inactive\\", \\"disfellowshipped\\" or \\"disassociated\\" this may be quite a fascinating read as they get a detailed yet unauthorized view into their much revered religious organization.<br /><br />Do you have a friend who is a Jehovah's Witness ?<br /><br />Understanding the JW mentality, I doubt any active JW's are going to consider the reviews written here on Amazon.  BUT ... if you have a friend who is involved in any way, shape, or form with the Watchtower Organization AND has an open-mind (meaning freethinking or independent-thinking) I would highly recommend this book for him or her.<br /><br />Keep in mind that the Watchtower Org. teaches against \\"independent thinking\\" and JW's are conditioned to be distrustful  and sometimes even vitriolic of Watchtower-critical material (even when written by university professors or as is the case here, a former Governing Body Member).  It seems \\"the Society\\" challenges others to analyze their religious or non-religious beliefs, but does not allow its JW members to do the same.  Sad ... but true :-(	2005-03-22

Frommer provides a good introduction to Europe without being overloading you with mass amounts of information or pictures, a truly well-balanced book.<br /><br />When I backpacked 4 months through Europe I had a copy of the Lonely Planet for Europe (a thick and heavy book) because it covered more cities and esoteric towns, a ripped chapters of all the international youth hostals Europe of the countries I visited, and as primary guide for nominal cities and capitals I used Frommers (ripped the book and kept only chapters of countries planning to visit - so I can keep the weight down).	2005-03-22

Alan Schreck is a professor of Theology at a Franciscan University in the US.  Additionally, this book has been sanctioned by the Roman-Catholic Church as being \\"nihil obstat and imprimatur\\" or Latin for \\"free from doctrinal and moral error.\\"<br /><br />A great book, an easy and fast read on the fundamental core beliefs and practices of Catholicism.  This book also delineates the beliefs and practices that comprise a secondary doctrinal tier from the core.  The explanations are easy to follow and they make reference to the Holy Scriptures.  Quotes are also drawn from early Church tradition and written historical accounts.<br /><br />As a result of reading this book, I can debunk the misconceptions taught in Sunday School early in my life about the Roman Catholic Church.  As a Protestant believer I have more appreciation for my Catholic Christian brothers and sisters in Christ.<br /><br />As other readers have mentioned, this book's role is NOT TO CONVERT but rather TO TEACH and is done with respect to the non-Catholic Christian readership.<br /><br />Its main two (2) roles are (in no order of importance):<br /><br />a) to teach Catholics of what their church teaches, and<br />b) also to raise awareness among the Protestant ranks of the most commonly misunderstood Catholic beliefs and practices, and how Catholics \\"should\\" understand them.<br /><br />As such I can see myself using this book quite often with my Protestant friends and relatives to kindly expose their false ideas about what Catholics believe and practice, and also gently correct my Catholic friends about what the Roman-Catholic Church teaches and believes.<br /><br />THANK YOU for your VOTES (up or down)!	2005-03-21

In this fictional romance detective (mystery/thriller) novel Joseph Kanon works with real historical facts (Allied occupation of Berlin in the summer of 1945) and places (Berlin and environs of Potsdam and Grunewald) to create a MORALLY INTROSPECTIVE plot.  Historical facts are presented to show the evils done not only by the Nazis, but also the Russian soldiers, and the American GIs.<br />As some of the other reviewers mentioned, this novel is not great for it's detective story.  Our action-hero, Jake/Jacob Geismar, is a war-correspondent for the US Army and seems to survive many incredulous circumstances.<br />The complexity of the novel is much more than untangling a web of mystery  in the underground world of post-WWII Berlin.  At the heart of the novel is the MORAL EXPLORATION of what we mean by good and evil, and of the nature of justice in times of war and relative peace.<br />As such, the title \\"The Good German\\" is a key to understanding the moral intricacies of the characters presented in this novel.  This title is echoed in only four places (as far as I could notice).<br />So what does it mean to be a \\"good German?\\"<br />According to Joseph Kanon:<br />a) \\"Not a Nazi.\\" (pg. 72)<br />b) De-nazified German scientists.

Since I am not a scholar, I had to rely on the back-end Notes a lot to understand the points the author was making in the respective chapters.<br />Nevertheless, following the three historical approaching to the Synoptic problem presented in the book, I have been fortunate (and blessed as a result) to learn a great deal about the history of the early Church, the development of Bible translations throughout the ages, and current trends in Christianity.<br />I would recommend this work to anyone seriously interested in Christianity (especially the canon, text, composition, and interpretations of the Gospels).	2003-07-06

Compared to many other cookbook, this one uses a very efficient system: gives a shopping list that will cover your cooking needs (recipes listed) for that whole week, and also customizes the shopping lists for specific seasons (Spring/Summer or Autumn/Winter).<br />Some things to keep in mind before buying the book:<br />a) Make sure you have/buy most if not all the Staples listed at the beginning of the book<br />b) There are some ingredients listed that may not be available in your regular grocery stores (and you will have to look for them in a health food store)<br />c) The recipes DO NOT call for a ton of oil/vegan-margarine (one tablespoon is the most I have seen).<br />d) Some recipes are super-yummy, others would work a little better with different spices, and others I would not make again.<br />SIDE NOTE: Since the Vegan diet contain No animal-based fats (and thus Zero cholesterol) it is important to keep in mind and consume cold-pressed essential oils (Essential Fatty Acids like omega-3 and omega-6 from flax, olives, sesame, etc.) on a regular and moderate basis.<br />Nevertheless, by following a daily diet using this book one will get sufficient essential nutrients, a variety of seasonal legumes and grains, and many times larger dishes than they can finish.	2003-07-06

Since the Harnacks were highly educated, came from esteemed families, and had influential friends in elitist Berlin society the reader also gets a glimpse of how divergent the views of various Germans and Americans were towards the Berlin regime.<br /><br />In conclusion, it is sad to see how a heroic German-American (Mildred Fish-Harnack) and an independent thinking German intellectual (Arvid Harnack) who spoke-out against, resisted, and even sabotaged the evil regime of Hitler met such a drastic end due to the follies and reckless acts of Stalin's regime.<br /><br />I wish there were more history books like this one written out there:<br />* impeccable research<br />* excellent prose (and thus easy to read)<br />* semi-autogiographical<br />* great lessons to draw about WWII, society, economy, and contemporary events.	2003-07-06
US	50689416	R32EO8ARLVU8JC	0844225533	850309538	When in Germany, Do as the Germans Do: The Clued-In Guide to German Life, Language, and Culture	Books	4	121	126	N	Y	Great Primer but NOT an  Authoritative Guide to German Life	I wish I could give this book a five start like the other reviewers, but I cannot due to my recent experience using this book in Germany.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get a quick and entertaining introduction to German Life, Language, and Culture.  But to someone who has already been to Germany, has an understanding of Deutsche Kultur, and/or is studying German I would recommend keeping an open mind to how limiting this book can be.  Let me elaborate:<br />While the book does a superb job of starting with a quiz (and most Germans love quizes) and provides the quiz answers in the back, has supporting articles and web-sites throughout the book, and even has a map of the 16 Budesl&auml;nder (federated States) it comes short of being Comprehensive or Authoritative.<br />What I had found when I used this book (quiz) with my friends and relatives in Germany is that:<br />a) Some answers may be debatable (section on 'Do As the Germans Do' and 'Know What the Germans Know').<br />b) Some statistics may have changed (section on 'Time,' 'Quantity' and 'Laws and Regulations') since the time Hyde Flippo wrote the respective articles.<br />In real life, Germans as a people are not as homogeneous as they come across when answering the quiz questions and reading the articles in this book.  Many Germans identify first with the region (Bundesland) where they live in.  Each region has their own traditions, festivals, and many time different public religious holidays (like the Catholic states in the southern part vs. the Protestant States central/northern Germany).  As such, someone from Th&uuml;ringen will answer some questions differently than someone from Berlin or someone from Hamburg.  Nevertheless the sections on 'People,' 'Places' 'What's That?' are invaluable to anyone.<br />A companion book that I would recommend is Richard Lord's \\"Culture Shock - Germany, A Guide to Customes and Etiquette.\\"	2003-07-06
US	50689416	R2XOQYHO4721M9	1558749543	216897568	Never Be Sick Again: Health Is a Choice, Learn How to Choose It	Books	4	99	109	N	N	A lot of common sense advice and some more ...	The \\"revolutionary\\" theory presented is that disease is cause primarily by deficiency (of vital nutrients) and toxicity (of foreign or internally-produced elements).  In the context of this book, Raymond Francis defines disease at the core as malfunctioning cells.<br /><br />The best thing about this book is the paradigm change of how to view human disease (in general) and it's two main causes.  The author makes sure he drills this in your head in the first four chapters.  The rest of the chapters each focus on one of six \\"pathways\\" to eliminate (or minimize) disease.  This is where the practical advice is found.  The content of these practical chapters seemed to be scattered and subsections were not connected very well.  Sometimes the information seemed to be even conflicting (on the surface) like one paragraph informing us that breastfeeding is the best way to feed babies, and then the next one telling us that even breast feeding is bad for the babies because of possible toxins passed on from mother's body.  The Genetic Pathway chapter was a bit of disappointment (very short) and I feel like there were more research studies and ideas that he could have included in the Psychological Pathway chapter.<br /><br />In general a lot of the advice in the book is plain & simple common sense: to live a healthy life and have a healthy body<br />* eat well (wholesome foods, preferably organic and not very processed),<br />* sleep well,<br />* have a positive/optimistic outlook on life,<br />* exercise regularly (which also helps reduce stress),<br />* and be an informed consumer about products one uses and consumes around the house (e.g. listed ingredients, cleaning agents and toxin sources).<br /><br />The second best thing about this book is the variety of resources (books listed in the Reference section) that the author has digested and distilled on his own time and then disseminated across this book.<br /><br />Reason why this book does not deserve five starts (IMHO):<br /><br />1) The information in the book is presented and discussed as being Gospel and with a very heavy evangelical undertone (and no, this is not a religious book).  Also this feeling is echoed by the title and subtitle (\\"NEVER be sick again, Health IS a CHOICE, learn how to CHOOSE IT\\").<br /><br />2) Examples of people benefiting from suggested changes seem almost allegorical since they are only presented by a first name with no extra specifics for verification.  The same goes for the medical research articles quoted (with the exception of one study where the month, title, and author are listed along with the journal name).<br /><br />3) As a strict vegetarian I was disappointed to read that Raymond does not recommend the vegetarian or vegan diet without elaborating on his opinion (even though studies have shown both the benefits and pitfalls of a plant-based diet).<br /><br />Overall:  Check this book at your local library, take everything presented with a grain of salt (balanced approach, with moderation), and if you like it, then buy it.<br /><br />THANK YOU for your VOTES (up or down)!discussed as being Gospel and with a very heavy evangelical undertone (and no, this is not a religious book).

US	50689416	R2CS6PP3E5OWAP	0812967623	743193338	The Catholic Church: A Short History (Modern Library Chronicles)	Books	5	7	11	N	Y	A brutally honest and concise history of the Roman Catholic Church	Hans K&uuml;ng does a brilliant job of compacting the Roman Catholic Church's theological/ideological, geo-political, economic, and social development of the past 2000 years in just 200 pages.  K&uuml;ng discusses Catholicism (ecclesiastical development) within the larger viewpoint of the development of Christianity.  As such one will learn quite a great deal also about the Eastern Orthodox Church and some valuable details about the splintering Reformation movement.<br /><br />While reading this book, I could not help but think that IF K&uuml;ng had lived during the late Middle Ages and published this book he would have been another John Huss burned at the stake or another excommunicated Marin Luther.<br /><br />It helps to realize that K&uuml;ng is an \\"insider\\" of the Roman Catholic Church (lived in the elite Collegium Germanicum, studied philosophy and theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University and Catholic University in Paris, and was an active participant to the Vatican II Council; read his autobiography \\"My Struggle for Freedom: Memoirs\\"), yet he has a very ecumenical view towards Christianity (and even towards other world religions).<br /><br />The last chapter of the book is the chapter where K&uuml;ng is making his case for a inter-religious-ecumenical world view that makes Christianity a sub-set of his ecumenical understanding.<br /><br />I was surprised to find out that K&uuml;ng still remains a Catholic even though he challenges the infallibility of the pope, the \\"ecumenical\\" nature of past church councils (since the 12th century), and various church practices that crept in the church since the late Middle Ages.<br /><br />Throughout the book K&uuml;ng reports the historical events objectively but towards the end of the book he seems to set up his agenda for Ecumenicalism and Reform ('restoration instead of renewal') within the Church (Roman Catholic).  I wish all the listed historical facts and developments would have a documented bibliography (but then the subtitle of the book would not be \\"A Short History.\\")  The index was useful, and having a chronology table was a big plus.then the subtitle of the book would not be \\"A Short History.\\")  The index was useful, and having a chronology table was a big plus.	2003-07-03
