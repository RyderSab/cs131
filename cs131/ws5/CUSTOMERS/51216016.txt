Emma finally hires someone to kill her husband since the law would not lock up him. Carlson's writing will quickly have you caring for Emma and her friend Andy as they are tried for the murder of Andrew Sigler. This is a book you will not want to put down. After finishing the book, I wish I could know more about Emma's life after her trial.	2005-09-27

Only movie I remember her being in is \\"On Golden Pond\\". I had seen her on TV a few times and heard a bit about her. <BR>Mr. Berg does a good job of giving us an overview of Hepburn's life. This is not a gossipy type biography nor one just full of dates and facts. Knowing some of the incidents that happened between Berg and Hepburn help in understanding Berg's view while writing this book. I felt the stories about Irene S. did not add much to the book. Even though we get to know some about Hepburn's personal life, I feel that we are still being kept at arm's length from really knowing who Katharine Hepburn was inside. Mr. Berg does a great job of writing a captivating story about a unique woman.	2003-07-21

With over 500 recipes you can find lots to like. The recipes use simple, easy to find ingredients. A great cookbook for beginning cooks, college students, busy people, and those physically unable to spend time in the kitchen. Soups, side dishes, meats, cakes, pies, cookies, appetizers. Also, the side notes about remarkable women make great reading.	2003-06-19

Each week focuses on a different woman of the Bible, some well-known and some not well-known. I like the way the story is first told in today's language and the information about the culture at the time that woman lived. The questions for each week are not the type that have a wrong or right answer, but they get you to think about how you feel and what you believe. As another reviewer said this is the first woman's devotional that does not focus on being a wife and mother. I think many men would also find this a great book to read and study from.<br />I highly recommend this book and will be sharing it with my Sunday School class in a few weeks. I think women of any age and personal situation will learn a lot from this book.	2002-06-25

The first few chapters are the worse, he goes on and on about how much smarter he is than other people. I really enjoyed the chapters where he describes his natural surroundings. Even though he believes his man should listen to his own drummer, he is very critical of city dwellers.<br />I think everyone should read this book once just to know what it is about.	2002-04-19

Her father is trying to marry her off to the highest bidder. Catherine does not look forward to being a wife, especially considering some of the suitors that come to visit. This book is fun to read and gives you a glimpse at \\"teenage\\" life in Medieval England.

Seton had founded a youth group called &quot;Woodcraft Indians&quot;. He later incorporated his ideas into the Boy Scouts of America. <br />This is not the type of book you sit and read from front to back. It is great to thumb through and see how things were done at that time. This was originally aimed at young boys from 11 years old and up. There is a lot of good information about campcraft, games and stories, in the book.<br />Along with this book, you should do some research online about the badge requirements for the Woodcraft Indians. It is very intriguing to find out what early scouts were required to do.	2002-04-18

The description of historic moments such as the signing of the Treaty of Paris, brought chillbumps to my arms. Adams is shown as a man passionate about his country, as well as his wife and children. The excerpts from letters between John and Abigail Adams add to the reader's knowledge of this great man.	2002-04-11

It is a well researched volume. It opened my eyes to a lot about the life of the Cherokees, both men and women. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Native American cultures. <br />Ms. Perdue makes what could be a boring subject into a great read. The book held my attention and piqued my interest in the lives of Native Amercian women from the past and today.	2002-04-11

I was reading it aloud to my 10 year old son. We were just about to give up on this one, when it got interesting. It did not compare to the first book in the series because of the lack of innovative ways Sam found to live. <br />If you read this book, stick with it until the end. It is worth the time.	2002-04-11

It is a book I thumb through again and again. Being a southerner, I laughed out loud as I recognized some of the characters as being like people I know. Bailey's Mama was apparently quite a character. One of my favorite chapters is &quot;A husband or something like it&quot;. I chuckle just thinking about it.	2002-04-11

The stories are well written and very informative. Readers will begin to think of Laura as a close friend. <br />My son is now 10 years old. I plan to read Farmer Boy with him this winter.
