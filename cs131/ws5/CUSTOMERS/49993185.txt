No summary of the book here, if you want that, look at one of the other reviews. <br /> <br />This is the first Brad Meltzer book I have read.  I could not put the book down...finished the 460 pages in two days.  If you are a fan of John Grisham type thrillers, you will enjoy this book.  I will be waiting for the movie to come out and reading some of Meltzer's other works.	2005-01-02

This is a great book for a beginner or someone not sure if they want to start playing golf. The book gives a brief overview of golf history, an explanation of golf equipment, and lessons on how to build a golf swing, and some tips on how to play the game.  Although Gary McCord peppers this book with some corny jokes, his knowledge and enthusiasm for the game make the book a great overview for a beginner. <br />I just recently started playing golf and the book gave me a quick and entertaining overview of the game.  Although the lessons to build your swing are well written and informative, I would recommend looking for books devoted to teaching the golf swing, watching videos, or taking lessons from golf pro if you are serious.  The instruction in the book is inadequate as a sole source of information for learning how to correctly swing a golf club.  Get this book as an introduction, but find something else to learn a great swing.	2002-04-22

I still have not seen the HBO mini-series yet, so I cannot compare the book to the series. This book is very entertaining and I would recommend it for anyone interested in WWII, war stories, and heroic tales.  It is one of the top 5 books I have read in my life.<br />Easy company's (an elite airborne unit) exploits are recreated by a series of interviews with the soldiers, old letters, manuscripts, and a few reference books. Ambrose weaves the myriad of information into a coherent and fast-paced story. The book gives the reader an idea of the terrors of war and many accounts of heroic actions taken by men (some scared some not) when put into the most difficult of situations. There is always a price to pay for freedom and the defeat of evil. The men that are described in the book all seem overly modest; they are all heroes in my book. God Bless the USA!	2002-03-29

They should just call this Stiner's biography. (Not necesarrily a bad thing, just not what I was expecting) I was expecting a pretty even account of special operation units and missions. What I got was one commando story told by someone other than Stiner and Stiner's biography. Stiner's story is very exciting at times, but also gets bogged down in administrative wranglings every now and then which slows the pace of the story down.  This is a decent read, but you will be disapointed if you do not know what you are getting into. Check out the other negative reviews for more details; it is unnecessary for me to repeat what they say.  If you want a more even account of US Special Forces along with slightly more entertaining account of missions and training check out The Commandos : The Inside Story of Americas Secret Soldiers<BR>by Douglas C. Waller.  Other books in this genre I love are Black Hawk Down and Bravo Two Zero.	2002-03-11

It is under 30 pages.  If you want to play blackjack without counting cards, but any of the popular blackjack books, whether they involve card counting or not.  I bought a bunch of them and all of them have a section at the begin on the basic strategy, which is what you are probably looking for anyways.  They are better written and cost just a few dollars more.  This book is worth ... tops.  Buy something else, I regret buying this book.	2001-09-23

I bought the first four harry potter books about a year ago and did not have the time to read them until last week.  I was wondering why the series was such a big hit and I found out.  The books put you in a made up world you do not want to stop reading about.<br />After reading the first book, I had to go read the second one right away.  That is how engrossing the books are.  I could not put this book down either.  I do not want to talk about the actual plot of the story for fear of giving something away.  All I can say is that, after reading the second book in the series, I want to tread the thir.  A very enjoyable read.  This series is fun.  If that is what you are looking for get this book.  You wouldn't want to skip it because each book represents a year of Harry Potter's life at the Hogwarts school.  I read in a biography magazine article that Rowlings plans to do 7 books total, one for each year of schooling.  GREAT BOOK!	2001-03-19

The books put you in a made up world you do not want to stop reading about.<br />When I did pick up the first book to read I could not put it down.  There are not too many characters which would confuse children (and adults who try to read real fast like I do), there are interesting twists in the story, and JK Rowlings Harry Potter world is just a nice escape from reality.

If you want to learn a little about SAP and how it has gotten to where it is this is a book that will give that to you.<br />On the other hand, the quality of writing and the style of the writing, I found lacking.  In the end of the book, the author claims that interviews with key players were used in writing of the book.  That did not show however in the book.  It seemed as if all the information was compiled from articles.  A decent telling of the SAP story, but by no means a great book.	2001-03-02

However if you want to shortcut having read many books, this book would be great for the beginner.<br />It will give you trading tactics(buying, selling, money management), an intro on technical analysis, and some explanation of what effects the markets.  This book has lots of information in a effectively written manner all compiled in an organized way.  If you are a beginner, this is a good place to start.  <br />If you have read tons of investment books already, I would guess that you have seen everything this book has to offer already.	2001-02-05

It will give you ideas on how to build your own system, which is in my view, the best thing you can do.  There is no fixed recipe for profitable trading, otherwise everyone would be doing it.  You need to make your own strategy and this book is valuable on that front.  I enjoyed reading it and learned from it, that is the highest compliment I can give a book.<br />Schwager fills this book with what he views as the best stock market traders based on risk/reward performance.  He defines this as consistent high returns (over 80% annually most of the time) over more than five years with low risk (few down months and low drawdowns).  I disagree with this approach from the beginning.  He should have at least included one, maybe a few traders who have probably made more money and performed better (returned higher percentages) than the people featured in this book.  In my opinion, even if some people are taking on more risk, if they are providing better returns, the risk if justified.  <br />The interviews flowed very nicely.  Although most trading systems were glossed over, you do get an idea of what has gotten these traders to where they are today, among of the best traders in the world.  How did they do it?  Some common threads I saw were hard work (long hours and years of education through trial and error), develop a personalized strategy that fits your temperment, using estimated/guestimated probabilities to ensure that trades were profitable &quot;on average&quot;.	2001-01-28

I have stayed away from investing in drugs and biotechs for over 5 years.  That is not my area of expertise.  This book is great in being a teacher of biotech history and technology.  It ties in biotech implications very well with drug development, agriculture, and other roles it will have in society.  If you want to learn biotech for the fun of it or because you want to start investing in biotech/genomics, this is a must read.  I have to warn you though, after reading this book, I have come to the conclusion that I will be buying a biotech fund instead of buying biotech companies.  The book makes things seem to complex and unpredicatbale for picking individual companies for the long term investment prospects.   They are just too many and their success is largely reliant on chance and luck.  Even if you are a daytrader or swingtrader, by improving your knowledge of the biotech industry, you will improve your chances of making money when you know what the press releases are talking about.    <br />Let me finish with why I did not rate this book a 5.  The wording that the author chooses is sometimes unclear and downright annoying.  There were at least 5 spots where I had to stop and ask myself.  Am I just stupid for not understanding what the author is trying to say, or is this written in caveman English.  I came to the conclusion that the unclear sentences were the fault of the author.  I have read many business/investing books where the author writes concise and flowing text.  This book was annoying to read at times because of Robbins-Roth's wordings.	2000-12-02
