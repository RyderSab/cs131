Massie's book on the naval struggle in the first world war is a highly comprehensive account of politics, strategy and tactics. <br /> <br />He gives useful insights to the characters of importance, showing why some opinions carried more weight than others. <br /> <br />There is a very useful level of analysis as to why a single capital ship with 15 inch guns was such a danger.  The hunt for the Goeben in the early days of the war made the British look like cowards.  But the days of Nelson were over, and a captain could now do wrong by putting his ship up against the enemy.  Quite simply, a large enemy ship could sink a squadron of cruisers before they ever came within firing range. <br /> <br />Jellicoe, as commander of the high seas fleet, realised that he was the only man alive who could lose the war for Great Britain in a single day.  He entered the war without a secure base for his fleet, which quickly came under attack from submarines and mines. <br /> <br />Captains were no longer in sole command of affairs at sea.  The invention of the radio allowed shore based admirals and the First Lord himself to barrage captains at sea with suggestions and orders, which complicated reporting lines, and confused the situation for captains. <br /> <br />Massie traces the resultant developments in strategy from these salient points, leading to the climactic Battle of Jutland, and the effective end of the surface war at sea. <br /> <br />A brilliant piece of work, and a fantastic piece of naval history writing.  While the book is large, it is surprisingly easy to digest, and makes for easy reading. <br />	2005-10-05

First off, it isn't the \\"Short history of nearly everything.\\"  It doesn't have the English Civil war, or Napoleon, or the Defenestration of Prague, or the US Civil War. <br /> <br />So, it is a Short history of the development of Science. <br /> <br />Now, when you write a \\"short history\\", by definition it will only skim the surface.  So those who have a detailed knowledge of physics, or biology, or astronomy, or chemistry, or bacterial phage viruses and their use in treatment of human disorders.....will undoubtedly find flaws and holes in many of the explanations. <br /> <br />I'm not a scientist (sounds like a toothpaste ad), so I could not tell you if Bryson is telling the truth or lying through his pants.  The bottom line is that he has written a book which explains many deep scientific arguments in a way which is accessible to anyone with an average high school education.   <br /> <br />As far as I am concerned this is a fabulous achievement.  This book ranks up there with \\"A brief History of Time\\" in making science accessible.  Granted, five minutes after you finish you will be unable to remember many of the salient arguments in science, but you do grasp them when you are there! <br /> <br />This is a book well worth taking the trouble to read.	2005-09-02

This book had me in stitches with great belly laughs throughout.  Born to an Irish Mother, but growing up in Warrington, he can adopt both an insiders and an outsiders perspective of life in Ireland. <br /> <br />McCarthy finds humour in the simplest of things.  He points out how his home town of Warrington is an unlikely place for Irish imigrants, being the home of Oliver Cromwell, scourge of the Irish. <br /> <br />As he says himself, his \\"research\\" for this book was far from unenjoyable, involving as it did long trips to ireland, days on end spent in pubs chatting to locals and tourists and downing copious amounts of alcohol. <br /> <br />He gives us the secret for measuring the level of value or rip-off you face in any town in Ireland - the singapore noodle index.   <br /> <br />He spends a lot of his time when outside of pubs or bed and breakfasts searching for neolithic and pre-celtic monuments.  He trudges up lonely hillsides searching for standing stones and stone circles, avoiding where he can the ones that contain a tourist office or interpretive centre.  He brings you to realise the depth of history that lies around every bend and on every hill in Ireland.  He also points out in the most gentle way that the Irish walk over, abuse and even paint over this unique heritage, often without knowing what it is. <br /> <br />Along the way McCarthy meets Americans, Italians, Germans and English touring or living in Ireland and manages to cram in plenty of hilarious national stereotypes into his encounters.  I especially like the story of the German taxi driver in West Cork, who came for the relaxed lifestyle, but insists on to the second punctuality from his fares.  Give him time I say, we'll wear it out of him. <br /> <br />The climax of his travels is the pilgrimage to Lough Derg.  This is a brutal pilgrimage undertaken by Irish Catholics who must sin like divils all year to deserve to go.  It involves three daysof starvation, sleep deprivation and being forced to hopple bare footed over cruel sharp stones.  Strangely enough people volunteer to do it.  McCarthy's description had me weeping I was laughing so hard.  In particular I loved his description of the daily meal (dry toast or oatcake with black tea or coffee) where he describes it in the form of a review for a fancy restaurant. <br /> <br />The question posed by McCarthy in the book asks if it is possible to have a genetic tie to place.  Is he in some way Irish?  The answer to this is easy.  Anyone reading this book can see instantly that such a witty raconteur can only be an Irishman.	2005-07-14

The book is supposedly the account of an American Writer, Grantly Dixon, telling of the ill fated passage of the ship \\"Star of the Sea\\" and the murder of Lord Kingscourt. <br /> <br />Each chapter is flagged with a lurid abstract detailing the horrors to be encountered therein.  Supposedly inserted by a sensationalist publisher, it accurately captures the type of editorial one would expect from a novel of the late 19th Century. <br /> <br />The story which unfolds is set to the backdrop of the Great Potato famine.  Genuine letters of those who suffered in the famine are used to colour in the social history of the novel. <br /> <br />The passengers on board are a distillation of British Society of the time.  We have the failed titled Irish landlord, his life threatened for his treatment of tenants.  His anglo wife, daughter of a social climbing industrialist, who's money supports the feeble efforts of the bankrupt Kingscroft.  The half mad animal stuffing old Viscount living in his crumbling pile.  The hoardes of starving and landless peasants with empty bellies and hearts filled with hate. <br /> <br />One of these peasants is the colourful victorian villain of the piece.  Pius Mulvey, the songwriting and womanising farmer who becomes a petty thief and conman in the fleshpots of London.  In his escape from prison he become a true monster, and is the raison d'etre for the supposed success of Grantley Dixon as a writer. <br /> <br />We know from the beginning that murder is to be done on this voyage, and we know who is to be murdered.  We are also told in no uncertain terms who will be committing the murder.  \\"Where's the surprise\\" you may ask.  Of course, it doesn't all go to plan. <br /> <br />A book that is rooted in history, filled with full and developed personalities and tells a whacking good story, what more could you ask for?	2005-07-13

Austen is the greatest writer of this type of fiction and this is her crowning glory.<br /><br />Coming from the world of high society in England of the late 18th Century, Austen lived the life she wrote about.  Having refused a compromise proposal of marriage herself, and lived out her life as a spinster, she was only too aware of the realities of the marriage game.<br /><br />Women in this society were marketable product, and both men and women were stratified by their annual income.  A titled person or someone from a noble family might improve flagging fortunes by marrying untitled money, but in general money married money and titles married titles.<br /><br />Into this delicate balance Austen throws her heroine - Eliza Bennett.  In any \\"proper\\" romance novel it should be the passionless and tame courtship of her older sister Jane to the wealthy Bingley and his bitchy sisters that should form the core of the story.<br /><br />Eliza opens the novel by turning down a proposal from an embarrasing, boring, unhandsome relative who has a modest income as a churchman.  To society this would have been a proper match for Eliza and it is unthinkable that she should refuse it.<br /><br />But Austen opts to sell a true fairytale and in doing so established a modus operandi for much modern fiction.  Eliza and Darcy begin by getting off on the wrong foot.  The remainder of the novel is an Anabasis from the confused territory of mistaken assumptions and impressions to an epiphany of understanding and mutual respect.<br /><br />On either side of this love story are the very proper courtship of Jane and Bingley on one hand, and the dreadful elopement of a younger sister with a complete cad on the other.<br /><br />The prize at the end is not just Darcy, but his wonderful estate of Pemberly, thoroughly described in the novel.  The reward for the characters is access to this estate (invitations to balls, summers holidays etc) and the virtuous are awarded open access while those who behaved badly are excluded and sent to parts of England furthest from Pemberly.<br /><br />The beauty of this story lies in the wit of conversation and letter.  The cutting comments, the razor sharp assesments of character.  The constant referral to income, house size, education and marriage prospects.  It is here that Austen really excels, and to appreciate just how funny the novel is requires the attention of the reader to what is being said.  Careful attention to the language carries a huge reward and I frequenly found myself collapsing in laughter while reading this book.<br /><br />I am not a fan of romance or of regency fiction, but I am a fan of this book.	2005-06-09

The title describes a moment in time when the lives of four people are in balance, when they find stability and happiness in the midst of turmoil. <br /> <br />Dina Dalal is a 40 something widow who clings fiercely to her independence after the death of her husband.  In a land where a widow has no status in someone else's house, she fights tooth and nail to hold onto her modest flat.  This involves taking in a lodger, and setting up a dressmaking business. <br /> <br />Maneck Kohlah is the young technical student who comes to lodge with her.  He bears on his shoulders the heavy weight of responsibility for the future of his parents business.  A business that is failing by degrees since losing half its territory in the division of Kashmir between India and Pakistan.  In Dina he may see what a parent could be without all the weight of expectation.  Perhaps Dina sees in Maneck what might have been if she had a son. <br /> <br />Dina employs two tailors to sew dresses for her, the pragmatic Uncle Ishvar, and his frustrated nephew Omprakash.  Trained as tailors by a Muslim, they have attempted to break out of India's Hindu caste system.  Their rural village is not ready for such profound change, and they are driven violently away to the city to find work.  They enter the seething cauldron of Bombay during a state of emergency declared by Indira Gandhi during the 1970's.  When their illegal squat is demolished, they beg to sleep on Dina's balcony. <br /> <br />Maneck, who has befriended Omprakash, pleads on behalf of the tailors.  Dina resists, not wanting to see her surrogate son fraternise with a low caste youth.  Besides, it will not do to have her employees too close.  Finally she relents and they move in.  The tailors develop some colourful contacts in the underworld, and their friendship with a beggar-master saves Dina's flat from being taken from her.  As a result their reliance on each other becomes reciprocal. <br /> <br />Fora time the uneasy relationship between the four holds together, and they experience a brief flowering of happiness.  But it is short lived.  The backdrop of great events in India intrudes on the fine balance they have achieved, and the end is unhappy for everyone.  We see the effect on ordinary people of government work programmes, forced sterilization, slum clearance, religious persecution, bureaucracy, exploitation, corruption and the caste system.  This world is underpinned by the dignity that the poor can achieve, the hope of a better life, the heat, colour, the smells and the plethora of small things that make India unique in the world. <br /> <br />This is a compelling and heart rending account of life in 1970's India.  It is beautifully written.  The prose seems to transport you bodily to the streets of Bombay, so that you hear the accents of the characters as they speak.  Like some complex Indian dish, it is spiced with stories and parts of stories and punctuated with a host of characters who fill the book to bursting point.  It is a book which describes the very soul of modern India. <br /> <br />	2005-04-28

Then they travel from one end of the Islamic world to the other, to Moorish Spain.  Racing all the way to defeat the evil schemes of the corrupt Master of the Knights Templars, the book races to a thrilling conclusion.  Will the Evil Renaud De Bracineaux get his filthy hands on the Grail, which he wants for himself, or will Cait save it.......for herself.....?  I'm sure she deserves it.  Something to do with keeping it safe until it is needed.

It is not the Da Vinci Code, so everyone lives happily ever after except for the bad guys.  But it is a fun read, and the research is good, so you get a good feel for the world of the Crusades. <br />	2005-03-21

Sharpes Escape is set in Portugal during the last French invasion attempt.  In great secrecy after Talavera Wellington constructed the Lines of Torres Vedras.  He created what was probably the greatest fortress in all of history by building a series of defences in two great lines in front of Lisbon. <br /> <br />Then he devastated all the land in central Portugal to deny Massena's \\"Army of Portugal\\" any food.  Since the French had long demonstrated their ability to live off the land, Wellington implemented a particularly harsh scorched earth policy, which resulted in great hardship for the Portuguese that winter. <br /> <br />When this was achieved, Wellington marched out and gave battle to Massena at the ridge of Bussaco.  Thinking himself up against a weak and ill disciplined army, such as those in Spain, Massena adopted brute force tactics.  He tried to force his infantry columns up the ridge against the British and Portuguese lines.  As any student of Musket warfare knows, lines decimate columns.  Columns only win when the lines cannot maintain their rate of fire, or if they run away. <br /> <br />At Bussaco the British and the well drilled Portuguese armies kept up their fire and roundly defeated Massena. <br /> <br />It is here that Sharpes Escape begins, with an accurate and exciting description of the Battle at Bussaco.  After the battle Sharpe is sent to Coimbra to destroy any remaining food stores before the French arrive.  As often happens, Sharpe finds himself behind enemy lines, with a beautiful girl on one arm and a bag of gold on the other.  Cornwells formula may be over used and hackneyed, but it still works, because he builds it into factual events.   <br /> <br />In this book the girl is an English Governess who is saved from the lustful clutches of an evil Portuguese boxer come smuggler and his venal sidekick brother, the traitor Major in the Portuguese Army.  The poor girl can no longer resist Captain Sharpe as they wade naked in the dark througha sewer pipe (no really, I couldn't make this up!). <br /> <br />The story comes to a nail biting conclusion when Sharpe finds his way back to his regiment in the middle of a skirmish at the lines of Torres Vedras. <br /> <br />Another good yarn for those who love Mr Sharpe and all things Napoloenic! <br />	2005-02-16

This book, the first in a series of three, gives Lawhead free rain to exploit his vast knowledge of all these elements. <br /> <br />It is a thrilling rollercoaster ride through the first crusade.  Historically this is a very accurate account of events, and I could find no discrepancies with the \\"Short History of the Crusades\\" by Reilly Smith. <br /> <br />But best of all, this reads like a good fantasy saga, complete with fortunes in gold, magnaminious kings, a holy lance and plenty of swashbuckling fun.

To this day it is a a mystery how Soults forces in Portugal allowed a British Unit to slip across the Douro on the Eastern side of Opporto, and take control of the Seminary.  It was a strategic disaster which ended in ignominy for Soult.  At one moment he was poised to declare himself King in Portugal, and in the next he was fleeing across the mountians, leaving behind his baggage train and his artillery. <br /> <br />So, who better to fill in that mystery, than Lieutenant Richard Sharpe and his Greenjackets.  Cornwell has slipped our favourite gang of riflemen into the right place at the right time to make Sharpe the hero of the day.  And this is what makes the Sharpe novels so compelling. <br /> <br />I was reading this book, with David Gates \\"The Spanish Ulcer\\" open on my lap, and I was fascinated at how Cornwell managed to weave his story into the truth. <br /> <br />Even the \\"Evil Colonel Christopher\\" backstory of plot and counterplot to stage a mutiny against Soult, is borne up by the facts. <br /> <br />On top of all this is a cracking good story.  The mid-section of the book is particulary compelling, when Sharpe has his men fortify a hill to keep them occupied, and then has to defend the hill against odds of 20 to one.  His protagonist in this battle, and the 31st Leger of French Light Infantry, are again real characters. <br /> <br />This is served up with all the painstakingly researched detail of the loading and operation of the Baker rifle, Smoothbore muskets, Cannon, Howitzers and Mortars.  We learn in-depth about fused shot, case shot, canister and round shot. <br /> <br />So, whether you are a history buff, a weapons buff, a fan of Napoleonic wars, in search of a good yarn, a war story or even a romance, there is something here for you.	2005-01-12

Beevor's approach in writing of Stalingrad was to remain as objective and analytical as possible.  It would be easy for any author to be drawn into the subjective experiences of this combat, the sniper battles, the personal suffering on both sides and the sheer horror of the coal face of the eastern front. <br /> <br />What Beevor does instead is to remain one step outside the suffering.  He draws our attention to all of these elements, but concentrates his greatest efforts into an understanding of the management of the campaign.  He meticulously traces the decision paths that led the Germans into Stalingrad and the stragegic problems faced by the Russian Stavka high command. <br /> <br />Most importantly he traces the history of decisions by Paulus, the subjugation to Hitler, the position of Manstein in leading the relief, and the reasons why the 6th army failed even to attempt to break out of the Kessel. <br /> <br />His analysis demonstrates how the Germans made one bad strategic decision after another to compound their errors leading to ultimate disaster.  The day they entered Stalingrad they lost their key advantage of mobility against the Russians.  Once tied down the battle became a numbers game of production, supply and troops, which could only end in favour of Russia. <br /> <br />\\"Failure to plan is planning to fail\\" might be the motto of the 6th army in Stalingrad.  A second winter spent in Russia without adequate winter gear is incredible.  The blatant lies from the Luftwaffe high command in Berlin regarding what supplies could be flown in really beggar belief.  And Hitler's \\"no retreat\\" orders sealed the fate of the 6th Army. <br /> <br />But Beevor also demonstrates the skill of the Russians in developing their own strategy.  They held onto Stalingrad by the skin of their teeth, but once they stopped the German advance, they realised the moment had arrived for a bold strategic thrust.  From being a resource deprived army on the retreat they changed into a dynamic mobile attacking force.  The boldness of operation \\"Uranus\\" shocked the Germans to the core, as they realised they had been ouflanked by a movement out of their own textbook. <br /> <br />Furthermore, the Russians correctly analysed the follow up options open to Manstein, and brilliantly neutralised his ability to relieve Stalingrad with operation \\"Little Saturn\\". <br /> <br />Finally, this book is summarised for me by two of the photographs in it.  The second photo in the book shows victorious confident clean shaven young german troops, dressed in summer shirts, sleeves rolled up, marching into Russia.  The final two photographs show tired, starving, unshaven germans, huddled miserably in greatcoats, with scraps of cloth tied to head, hands and feet, being hearded off to captivity.  This is a story with a moral.  Pride comes before a fall!	2004-11-16

This novel sparks with humour from time to time, and fairly swims in satire as Pratchett takes a good natured poke at everyone he can.  A wolf called Gavin, Fat mines, Disappearing sugar, a race of Igors gleefully trading body parts (someone will be back on his feet this time tomorrow) are all the usual from Pratchett. <br /> <br />The Scone of Stone is a direct poke at the Scots and the Stone of Scone which was only recently returned by the English.  The three gloomy sisters in the Cherry Orchard and Uncle Vanya all suggests that our Terry was leafing through his Tchekov when he wrote this book.  And Lady Margalotta, the Vampire on the wagon (one night at a time?) make for good reading. <br /> <br />But while this book sparks and sputters from time to time, it never really takes off.  Neither the story nor the humour.  It is not up to the standard of early novels, or the novels that introduced characters such as Mort, Death, Guards Guards etc.  It will go down well with the discworld fanatics, but if you are a newcomer to diskworld don't start here! <br /> <br />	2004-11-10

Firstly I saw the movie starring Sean Connery and Christian Slater.  Then I read Foucaults Pendulum, which is a brilliant parody of the Grail Questers of books such as the \\"Da Vinci Code\\".  Then I read Baudolino, which is a ribald poke at the whole business of relics and divine inspiration. <br /> <br />Finally I decided to go to the source and read the text of the Name of the Rose. <br /> <br />A few comments: <br />The Movie is brilliant, and captures a lot more of the book than I had expected.  As a result of the quality of the movie, the book came over as being slow. <br /> <br />Because I knew the plot, there was no surprise for me when the \\"Mystery\\" was solved, and I lost out on any anticipation the book holds.   <br /> <br />As this was a first novel I get the feeling that Eco threw in the kitchen sink.  There are lots of asides that obviously arise in his university work, which serve to clutter rather than enlighten his book.  Effectively this is two books rolled into one, the first being a medieval murder mystery and the second being a history of the high medieval church to the point just before the black death struck Europe. <br /> <br />Much of what he writes about heresies and relics in this book is dealt with better, and more humourously in Baudolino. <br /> <br />The constant forays into latin are interesting enough if you frequent tridentine masses or are a latin scholar, but it is no surprise to me that a key to the work was subseqently published.  To the non-latin reader it must be very frustrating. <br /> <br />This book became one of those \\"instant classics\\" and I feel that this had a lot to do with the inaccesibility of many of these passages of text.  It became a cult novel of pseudo intellectuals who could debate various reasons for insertion of passages.  In my opinion Eco was foolish to supply a commentary on his motives.  He should have left it shrouded in myth.  When Don McLean was asked what the song \\"American Pie\\" meant, he said \\"It means I never have to work again\\". <br /> <br />Classic or not, it will go down in history as a seminal novel.  \\"The Name...\\" has spawned a rash of copycat historical mystery books to create an entirely new genre and to my mind it led the way for books such as the Da Vinci Code, Longitude and Fermats Last Theorem.	2004-10-05

It pokes fun at Tolkien, Jordan and the other heavyweights of Fantasy Literature. <br /> <br />The reason it is English is because some of the jokes are very local to the UK.  For instance you would have to know that there is a DHSS in the UK and what it is to get one joke, have an idea who Lord Lucan was and a few other \\"in-jokes\\".  Mostly however, any fantasy reader will spot the references. <br /> <br />One of the difficulties with writing a parody of any genre is that you have to actually write a good story to carry the parody off.  Bibby does this, and you actually find yourself getting interested in the wellbeing of his central characters. <br /> <br />But most importantly, this book throws our preconceptions on their head as often as it can.  Elves who can drink alcohol all night and wake up with a tan, but for whom seawater is highly intoxicating.  The Orcs have non-stop acid house parties where they lure the unsuspecting to their death (a great takeoff of the Dwarf diary in Moria in Fellowship of the ring).  There is a carnivorous donkey, a way around every spell, boring sword salesmen, pubs serving bad beer, a smith who's flimsy swords are a source of constant embarrassment and plenty of other good laughs. <br /> <br />Not of the same stature as Terry Pratchett, but worth a look.	2004-09-08

On first glance, such a slim volume would seem to be something you could read quickly.  Not so!  The turgid and heavy prose is over-ornamented and complicated by ye olde New England Puritan syntax. <br /> <br />I suspect that even when it was written Hawthornes prose was never accessible, and in the modern context it is so far from spoken english that reading it is like wading through treacle.  It is sweet, cloying and ultimately sickening. <br /> <br />The underlying story is simple, a universal enough theme to span the ages, and could easily be rewritten well into the modern context. <br /> <br />It is never easy to be harsh with a book that is listed as a \\"classic\\" but in this case I feel I must be truthful about it.  This is not an easy nor an enjoyable read.  It is hard work.  To be oxymoronic I suppose it is the heaviest light read and the fattest slim book I have encountered. <br /> <br />Read it at your peril!	2004-09-03

A lesson on how to write in codes, and some word puzzles.  Party games and hobbies that children love, such as how to make wands, wizard sticks, magician hats and animal masks. <br /> <br />There is not a single mention of Harry Potter, which is refreshing, although Merlin and Gandalf, my own favorite wizards, do get a mention. <br /> <br />The illustrations are excellent, highly detailed with lots of elements for children to hunt for on the page.

Philbrick has written his book in the style of a \\"Docu-drama\\" on the TV.  That is to say, this is neither a history of events, nor is it a novelisation.  It hangs awkwardly in-between. <br /> <br />On the one hand the author provides us with pages of notes at the end of the book, and makes this \\"Seem\\" like a well researched history of events.  But on the other hand he injects excitement and character into the book by imagining the inner workings of the minds of those involved. <br /> <br />At times, to illustrate sufferings or events, he leaps to other incidents (the Donner Party) and to studies (of thirst and hunger) to explain the decisions or points of view of the characters involved.  This can be disorientating, but generally helps the modern reader to get to grips with the subject. <br /> <br />What Philbrick singularly fails to do is to convey the reality of life aboard a whale ship to his readers.  Many other books have done this far better.  Dana's \\"Two years before the mast\\", and Melvilles \\"Moby Dick\\" give much more insight into the sailors lot, and there are many other well known incidents that Philbrick could have drawn upon to illustrate his story better. <br /> <br />This is a light read, and interesting to someone who knows little or nothing about the subject.  But for those who have read a lot on things nautical it comes across as shallow, and clearly an outsiders perspective.	2004-08-16

This is a series of books that follows the most colourful characters who made the Late Roman Republic such a fun and exciting time and place to study. <br /> <br />In her first book, \\"First Man in Rome\\" she charted the rise, rise and rise of Gaius Marius.  This was followed by \\"The Grass Crown\\" which concentrated on Sulla, the man who displaced Marius and became Dictator of Rome. <br /> <br />In \\"Fortunes Favorites\\" we followed the early career of Gaius Julius Caesar as he struggles to grow up in a Rome torn asunder by Marius and Sulla. <br /> <br />Here, in Caesar's Women, we see Caesar in the full flush of his political career, his year as Aedile when he gave the best Games in Rome, and his subsequent elevation to Pontifex Maximus, followed by his Praetorship, Governance of Spain Province and election as Consul. <br /> <br />His relationship with Crassus and with Pompey is developed beautifully, as is his love hate relationship with Servilia and the bethrothal of his daughter first to Brutus and then to Pompey. <br /> <br />Catilina, Cicero and Clodius in particular provide excellent comic relief from the stern doing of roman politics. <br /> <br />This series is a real joy to anyone who has studied classical history as it brings the Forum to life.  But I am sure it provides just as much fun to people who have never read of these events before.	2004-08-13

His protagonist is an italian peasant who claims to be an adopted son of the Holy Roman Emperor and a Ministerial of Frederick Barbarossa.  Baudolino is a liar, a professional liar.  He has made his reputation by lying.  So can we believe him? <br /> <br />As with the main Character in Peter Carey's \\"Illywhacker\\" we find ourselves being drawn into Baudolino's web of deceit, because it is so entertaining.  We really want to believe, despite the fact that he tells us it is all lies.  Want to find the holy grail, it's here, along with the elusive kingdom of Prester John, the Head of John the Baptist, a hammer belonging to Moses, the Shroud of Turin, most of the major relics of the Christian Church, made to order by Baudolino and his gang of thieves. <br /> <br />Philosophy and religious debate created at will with the assistance of Hashhish and wine.  Unicorns, Satyrs and a host of impossible creatures, all made believable and wildly funny.  From the opening chapter where he tries to capture a Unicorn, Baudolino is a really funny book, which at the same time addresses many of the key themes of 13th Century Europe.

In the process Cornwell slips another ship of the line into the battle of Trafalgar on either side.<br />Sharpes Trafalgar is a great swashbuckling novel in the best tradition of Hornblower.  It moves from Conmen in India to Pirates on the high seas.  There follows a nailbiting sea chase between two 74 gunners, culminating in the Battle of Trafalgar.  <br />Along the way is a love story, deception, blackmail and revenge, all the usual depth and richness of Cornwells back plots.

This is the first Sharpe novel I have read, although I did catch some of the TV series.  I am not a fan of multiple formula novels churned out by lazy writers, and I was suspicious of this series.<br />But Cornwell has done something different here.  He has taken real events, from the career of Arthur Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington).  Then he has inserted the character of Richard Sharp, a canny ex-thief ranker in the British Infantry.  One of the men Wellington was to describe as &quot;Scum of the Earth&quot; after Badajoz.  From the viewpoint of Sharpe we see the business end of the British Army, a worms eye view of the rise of Wellesley and the Indian and Peninsular campaigns.<br />What you are getting is real history fleshed out with a cracking good story.  And it is very well done!  I am very tempted to dig further into this substantial series of books.  I can see why they have become so popular.	2004-06-16

Any politics or economics are introduced only to explain logistical difficulties or broad trends in strategic direction.<br />In most English focused histories Wellington is portrayed as some kind of superman who went out to Spain and roundly defeated one French army after another.  Gates shows how far this is from the actual truth.  He highlights the crucial role played by Peninsular forces, who fielded one army after another to keep the French busy.  He demonstrates how the partisan guerilla war prevented the French from concentrating against Wellington to drive him out.<br />At the same time he demonstrates just why Wellington was the greatest soldier of his age.  How he used intelligence and patience as his weapons.  How he always selected his preferred battleground to gain maximum advantage against the French, who were after all, masterful foes.  Wellington was the master of Soult, Ney and Massena, but not by much.  He admitted that he would have lost if Napolean had been there himself.<br />Gates lavishes praise on the abilities of the French to survive in the harsh environment of the Peninsula, and at the same time extolls the mastery of the British use of naval support to outflank their gallic rivals.<br />From an Irish perspective it is interesting to note the large number of Irish named Generals fighting for the Spanish, the English and the French.  Blake, Clarke, O'Donnell, Lacy and O'Neill to name only a few.<br />If I had any criticism of this book it would be on the way maps are presented.  You always have to check which way is north.  I prefer when North is the top of the page!  Otherwise the large numbers of maps of all scales are a very useful tool in interpretation of the movements in the battles.<br />Gates is also helpful in giving the reader a brief introduction to the tactics of Napoleonic armies, explaining the purpose of line, column and square, the flanking manoevre, use of the reverse slope, the use of Cavalry V Infantry etc.  A really wonderful book!	2004-06-04

If anyone ever set out to write a comic, anti-war, Sci-Fi modern classic I am pretty certain they would have failed miserably.  But this is what Vonnegut has done, and he has succeeded.<br />This is a short and powerful book.  Vonnegut introduces it with a chapter about how he came to write the book, and then tells us how it begins and how it ends.  In doing so he establishes an important point.  The events in the book are to be viewed from a Tralfamadorian perspective.  These aliens see all time in a single moment.  Death is immaterial to them because existence is not linear, so you always exist, even after your temporal death.<br />So the events in the novel follow no chronology.  They leap from 1960's America to the planet of Tralfamadore at any time, and back to the war in 1944, and back earlier, and forward later.  The hero of the piecel, if he can be called that, is Billy Pilgrim, an american soldier in the Second World War, an optometrist after the war who is rich because he marries the fat daughter of a wealthy Optometrist.  She marries him despite the fact that he is a psychiatric patient suffering a nervous breakdown because of the war, or because of college stress, or because his father threw him in the deep end of the pool.<br />Their son is a troublesome boy, who straightens himself out, joins the Green Berets, goes to Vietnam and contributes to the good of society by killing Vietnamese.<br />Vonnegut finds the absurd and the funny in the most mundane of normality.  And because of this he constantly surprises the reader.  The items Pilgrim finds in the coat in the war are a case in point.  A diamond (that goes into his engagement ring) and a denture, which he keeps.  One is as arbitrary as the other in value terms.  Whereas his companion is shot by firing squad for &quot;looting&quot; a teapot in Dresden.<br />This is a short and easy read, but do not be deceived.  It is a terse and concentrated work of art, that will yield returns to the careful readerlong after you put it down.	2004-06-03

I suspect this is one of those series that gets better as you go along.  The opening salvo in a space opera saga is always going to be difficult.  There is so much world building going on that there is little room for the story.  So the writer faces a challenge, does he produce something on the scale of fellowship of the ring, which is so large it will put many readers off?  Or does he write something small enough to attract purchase, but which will never satisfy expectations.<br />So this Author has gone for a small book as a sampler of things to come.  And he has done an excellent job in that regard.  The story jumps between two universes, a near future earth, and a distant planetary confederation.  And the latter is the more interesting place, reptilian saurs who live thousands of years, Gigants and elegant Pithkies, star travelling merchant traders who are transported on ships belonging to giant squid, and planet bound humans who are somehow descendants of those in the near future earth thread.<br />A lot of homage is paid to cold war politics, workable communism (as if) and Area 51.  There are some good laughs for computer programmers in a world where an archeology degree may include a module on MS-DOS or Windows applications.  Technologically this book brings nothing new to the table, and as a result has a certain comfortable familiarity that makes all the technology seem accessible.<br />I think I'll invest in book 2, and see where it goes from there!	2004-05-24

This book examines the contributions of the Irish who fought on both the nationalist and republican sides in the spanish civil war.  As Stradling points out, the passing of time has rendered pariahs of the (...) XV Bandera Irish Brigade led by Eoin O'Duffy, and has made glorious heros of those who served with the XV International brigade.<br />It is a strange situation where the losers of the conflict emerge as the winners in the battle for a place in history.<br />Stradling demonstrates that the Irish Brigade fighting for Franco were not actually (...).  For the most part they were good catholics who were urged by the clergy to go on this \\"last crusade\\".  They were motivated by cinema newsreels which showed how anarchists and communists defaced churches and murdered clergy in the early part of the Spanish Civil War.  The Irish brigade had a terrible time, becoming a political football from the very beginning.<br />The Irish Government feared that they would succeed in raising 5,000 to 10,000 troops, and that on the conclusion of the Spanish Civil War this veteran army, backed by (...) comrades from Spain, Italy and Germany, might bid to take over Ireland.  But the Irish government walked a knife-edge.  Outright condemnation of the \\"crusade\\" might be seen as anti-catholic.<br />Similar considerations applied in Spain.  General Mola wanted to bring over the Irish brigade under his wing, and have them fight with devout catholic requetes under his control.  This did not suit Franco in his bid for overall control.<br />Amid all this wrangling it is a testament to the organisational abilities of O'Duffy that he succeeded in shipping 700 or so brigaders to Spain.  However, he then demonstrated his unsuitability as a leader by spending his time swanning around fancy dinners while his men suffered in filthy wet trenches.<br />When the Irish brigade (sensibly it seems to me) refused to sarcrifice their lives in pointless charges as the Foreign Legion (Tercio) were wont to do, Franco wanted to be rid of them.  They left Spain under a cloud and returned to an Ireland that quickly saw them as an embarrasment.<br />How differently were percieved the Republican Irish.  Men who stepped straight into the cauldron of Jarama, suffered dreadful losses and demonstrated their bravery and their worth by holding up what would have been a killing blow by Franco.<br />And yet the International brigaders saw just as much farce as their countrymen in the Nationalist trenches 10 kms across the valley.  When they found that some of their English officers were former black and tans the ex-IRA men pulled their guns on them.  After a tense mexican standoff a group of 40 or so Irish troops were moved from the British to the American (Lincoln) battalion.<br />All in all this book is a fair and very balanced account of the politics and the experience of the Irish in Spain.  And taking the emotion out of the history allows us to see that the differences between the Irish on either side were few.  It was subsequent events that lent them their later significance.	2004-04-05

Somerville and Ross were a pair of ladies from the West Cork Gentry who lived in the pretty village of Castletownsend on the south coast of Ireland.

The stiff upper lip of the English Major serving as the local magistrate (judge) is a perfect counterfoil to the thieving, poaching, lying, brawling and drinking of the local populace, which is paraded before the judge in the course of his daily work.<br />A beautiful snapshot of life in the Ireland of the late 19th century, lovingly, honestly and humorously portrayed.

Edmund Van Esbeck was for many years the &quot;voice of Irish Rugby&quot; through his well regarded column in the Irish Times.  No one has a more thorough knowledge of the game in Ireland and this shines through in his books.<br />The English tell the story of William Webb Ellis picking up the soccer ball in Rugby School, and thereby inventing the game of Rugby.  We Irish, of course, know that Ellis grew up in a British Army barracks in Tipperary, Ireland.  He learnt his wayward habit of carrying the ball in the hand while watching the Irish boys play the Gaelic version of football.<br />So, Rugby is actually an Irish invention.  And since American Football was derived from Rugby, the Irish claim to have pretty much invented Gridiron too.

But I wholeheartedly recommend this series to any fan of hard sci-fi or of space opera.  Even fantasy readers are delighted by the broad canvas and the exploration of the lines between life and afterlife, finity and eternity.<br />If you have been following the story so far, this volume concentrates on five main story threads.  <br />Dexter Quinn is travelling, in Odysseus-like fashion, to a reunion with the Enigmatic Banneth on Earth.

I ordered this book because I was researching the fortunes of the Irish Brigade in Spain.  I was expecting to get the factual information presented in the usual dry historical format.<br />I was so pleasantly surprised with the relaxed narrative, that I read further into the book, and became captivated by the stories of other groups who fought for Franco.<br />In the first twenty or so pages Keene gives an introduction and historical context to the war that serves as a neat summary for anyone wanting to know a little about the subject.<br />Then she goes into the detail of various volunteer groups who fought on the Nationalist side during the war.  Because she is looking at volunteer outfits, Keene does not include the major foreign contributors to Franco's Campaign.  For instance, she is not writing about the German, Italian and Moroccan contingents.  <br />The key groups of volunteers are dealt with in separate chapters.  One for the English speaking volunteers which includes information on Americans, British and the Irish Brigade.  Then she examines the French contribution.  Another chapter examines the contribution of the White Russians, and finally the Romanian Iron Guard.<br />She also includes a chapter on foreign female reporters, publicists and medical personnel who supported the Nationalist cause.<br />Franco was careful to downplay the role of foreigners in the Civil War, and Keene highlights his caution in this regard.  He made much of the volunteer forces because they were generally small and symbolic of the wider Catholic support for his cause.  He was most careful not to publicise the huge levels of support he received from Axis countries and the Moroccans, as he was trying to portray the struggle as a new Spanish Crusade, rather than as a battle between fascism and communism.<br />In all, this is an intelligently researched and well written look at a very interesting subject.	2004-02-23

Lately he has taken to moving the cheese to Eastern Europe and south east Asia, where the native mice don't eat as much.<br />But one thing in this book is very true.

Time has passed, and the nuclear threat has receeded.  The expectation is that &quot;On the Beach&quot; would become terribly dated as a result.<br />But it is not.  The reason may be that Shute concentrated his novel on the people, on how they cope with the end of the world, rather than on the technology, the how and the why.<br />As time goes by the radiation spirals further and further south to threaten the Australians.  In response they attempt to go about their business with what normality they can muster.  The book raises the interesting questions over how each of us might act when death comes knocking on the door.

The world is full of quick fix books, lose 10lbs in two weeks, double your sales or your money back.  The problem with quick fixes is that they tend to work only in the short term.<br />What this book explores is the strategies that will help you win over the long and extremely long term.  This is the kind of book that excites people in long term focused companies such as Coca Cola or Unilever.  People who look at the lifetime value of a customer instead of next months sales target.<br />And because you are planning for long term, it is not a book that will &quot;instantly change your life&quot;.  Reading this book is only the beginning of a long hard road to affect change in the way your organisation treats people.  Having read the book I am now embarking on implementing the concepts by reworking my segmentation plan.  This may have paybacks down the line in terms of fewer defections from my company to competition.<br />But it is really hard to measure just how successful I will be over time.

While his fellow artistes (extra e being intentional) were lofty in their ideals and flowery in their language, writing often in rhyme or blank verse, O'Casey was very much the man of the people.  Yeates, Synge and Beckett were concerned with ideals, classical parallells, celtic revival and universality while O'Casey painted the life of the working classes.<br />In that regard O'Casey holds a lot in common with Russian writers of the period, and with marxist treatments.  But in the Holy Catholic Ireland of his day he was viewed with suspicion by the authorities and with contempt by the artistic aristocracy.<br />So it is somewhat fitting that the three plays in this book have more to say about the period than most of the &quot;great&quot; contemporary Irish works of the day.  Certainly they have become far more popular and remain accessible to many people both thorough professional and amateur productions.<br />For me, O'Casey is at his best when he is in the tenament room with the ordinary people, and this is what makes Juno and the Paycock the most enjoyable of these plays.  Layabout workshy men supported on the backs of strong hard women are as universal a theme you can get, but it is a theme made funny and poignant by O'Casey.<br />The Plough and the Stars is a milestone portrayal of the events of the Easter Rising on the ordinary people of Dublin, for whom the events were a frightening irrelevance that pulled them out of their daily struggle with hunger into a greater struggle for freedom and nationality.  This turning point is captured with sheer brilliance by O'Casey, but it is left up to the theater producer to maximise it, and I have seen good and really horrendous productions of this work.<br />All three are excellent plays.  Important works, not only in an Irish context, but giving voices to the disadvantaged in any society.	2004-02-06
US	49621826	RYCHIOLQNIZ36	0897608224	833035222	Crock of Gold	Books	5	25	26	N	N	A genuine timeless classic.	James Stephens is one of the writers who produced the works that have come to be called the &quot;Celtic Revival&quot;.  In the late Victorian era writers in Ireland, Scotland and Wales had their own rennaisance of the classical works of medieval celtic literature.  In Ireland this revival took on an added dimension as it became associated through figures such as Yeates and Maude Gonne with the struggle for Irish Independence.  Ultimately the rediscovery of classical celtic poetry and prose gave a language, a history and a nationalistic justification to the rebels.<br />William Butler Yeates, John Millington Synge, Oliver St.John Gogarty, James Joyce and Samuel Beckett are all renowned worldwide for their contributions to international literature.  Be it on stage or in prose, they brought a poetic flavour to their art, a free flowing and lilting verse that permeates all their work.  This signature blank verse gives an ancient grandeur to the literature of the period, carrying echoes of the ancient celtic poets, and redolent of Chauser and Shakespeare.<br />James Stephens is less well known than his compatriots, but no lesser in quality.  If anything his is the purest voice of the Celtic Revival.  He is easily on a par with writers such as John Milton and Edmunde Spencer, who wrote similarly high works of art.<br />But the beauty of Stephens is that his subject is the folklore of daily Irish life.  Happy and jolly tales of leperachauns and fairies, small events of great import, the philosophy of field and wood.  It is at once grand and accessible.  The tales have a childlike attraction and simplicity to them that is belied by the quality of the prose.<br />Whether reading for a bit of fantasy, a good laugh, or to study literature, you will not regret reading these tales.	2004-01-30

In the early days of the Christian Church there was a small flock of believers who really engaged in their religion.  They thought it through and argued over the nature of divinity and what it meant to be a Christian.<br />As one would expect, with such ardent argument going on, there were many diverse views of what belief should be.  The Gospel of Thomas is only one of these beliefs.  Gnostic Christianity is another.  To compound the matter the Christian church was ruled by five prelates, each seeing himself as equal to the other four.  Rome, Byzantium, Antioch, Jereusalem and Alexandria each felt entitled to promote their own ideas.<br />Over time, as the church grew larger and larger, there was an increased need for simplification.  Argument confused new converts.  The church decided to sell one single message.  And the Gospel of St John emerged as the winner over the Gospel of St Thomas.  There were undoubtedly many other texts discarded along the way to arrive at the Catholic Dogma.<br />Once the Dogma was agreed, all other beliefs and arguments became heresy, and they were rooted out and culled by a church that went from strength to strength.  The wisdom of the approach adopted by the Christian church was attested to by it's subsequent success.<br />But in the last century, with increasing educational levels, the faithful are asking hard questions again in a way they have not done since the days of the early Christian church.  And the major churches have singularly failed to answer these questions.  This has caused a fall off in church attendance, a drift into eastern beliefs and a revival of gnosticism.<br />Elaine Pagels raises many questions in her book, and points to the personal circumstances that led her to ask the hard questions of her church and her belief.  She had revived her own faith by revisiting the thinking of the early church.  And she hopes that others can do the same.<br />For a Vatican that is horrified by the revival of the &quot;Eastern Heresy&quot; this is bad news, and they do not like it.  But then the Vatican has been out of step with society for the last 40 years.  It is locked in a medieval timewarp that is a product of feudalism and the &quot;divine right to rule&quot;.  They seem to have missed events such as the English Civil War, the French Revolution and the arrival of democracy.  The idea that wisdom could flow upwards from the &quot;flock&quot; is foreign to the organised church, who are too used to dictating from the top.	2004-01-30

Previously I read &quot;Wolf in Iron&quot; by Gordon Dickson, and it is one of the best post-holocaust novels I have ever read.  A truly wonderful book, and brilliantly written.  I was expecting the same qualities in this book.<br />But here is something altoghether different.  Perhaps it is because Dickson is trying to tell the story from the viewpoint of the protagonist, Shane Everett.  Little Shane Beast is a translator working for the nine foot tall alien occupiers of earth.  Cold dispassionate and unemotional beings, Shane must behave like them to survive.  And not only does he survive, but he excells.  Is this why the whole story is told in such a cold, logical and dispassionate prose?<br />The plot is simple and bare, as clean as the cities in the Aalaag occupied world.  There are no plot turns, no multiple plots, no side character, no maturing of the hero.  Nothing.  The tale is simple to the point of starkness.  Something that I found to be unsatisfying in the extreme.<br />The premise of language as a route to understanding has been done far better in &quot;Fine Prey&quot; by Scott Westerfield.  There are many more interesting and uplifting novels about alien invasion of earth.<br />What this book does deliver on is the horror of earth being occupied by a race who are so far above us that we cannot reach an understanding of their technology.  A race that does demote us to the status of beasts.  As top dog on our planet we have a dreadful superiority complex.  We imagine that eventually we would get the better of any alien species we encounter.  But what if we couldn't.  Dickson's Aalaag are so superior to us that a single fully armored warrior would not be in danger should the whole planet rise against him.  Humans become as powerless as a hive of bees to him.  As long as we produce output we achive the status of being useful.  Otherwise we are little more than pests.  Perhaps it is this very vision that makes this book so unsettling?	2004-01-09

It shows the origination of the Roman Military System, the development to its peak in the late republic- early empire period, and the decline of the Roman military along with the Empire.<br />Key battles are used for illustrative purposes, and give an excellent picture of the effectiveness of the manipular system, the use of cavalry and the importance of reserves.<br />Where this book is a bit light is that it does not give a detailed description of the gear of a legionnaire, rank uniforms etc.  Also, the legion structure could be laid out more clearly in the appendices.<br />Where the book excels is in explaining the drift from a republican citizen army to a professional army, and from a Latin army to one made up of conquered peoples.  It also explains the transition from armies led by Consuls and Governors to legions led by Imperial Legates, and ultimately by professional soldiers from non-Senatorial classes.  All of this is fundamental to the shift from a Republic to an Empire, and is key to any study of the history of Rome.<br />This makes it a book valuable to students of Roman politics who have little or no interest in the Military History.  Goldsworthy establishes that regardless of whether the political events changed the army or vice versa, a proper study of Rome cannot ignore impact of the Military Arm in dictating the Path of Romes affairs.	2003-12-08

This book examines the development of war in ancient Greece through the dark ages after the collapse of Mycenean civilization and through the Classical period, Hellenic Period and up to the conquest of Greece by Roman Legions.<br />First of all it is important to be aware that the author assumes the readers knowledge of primary texts of the era.  He refers frequently to books such as Herodotous Histories, Thucydides Peloponnesian war, Xenophon's Anabasis and the works of Plutarch, Arrian, Polybius and Xeno amongst others.<br />Victor Davis Hanson believes that the way we fight today is a direct descendant of the Greek method of fighting.  He contends that the successes of the Greeks against Persian armies dictated the development of war down to the present day.<br />This is a huge contention and one that I believe he fails to support.  He speaks at length about the \\"Western way of war\\" without establishing how this differed significantly from other military systems.  His contention that it was only in Greece that shock battle developed is flawed.  Shaka, king of the Zulu nation, independently developed shock battle tactics, and he can be only one of many who came to the same end result from different starting points.<br />At times I felt that Hanson was trying to be sensationalist in making contentious statements that are ill supported by argument.  Some examples of this tendancy are the following brave assertions!:<br />\\"The great Chinese military strategist Sun-tzu is sometimes cryptic, often mystical, and always part of some larger religious paradigm.\\"<br />\\"Too many scholars like to compare Alexander to Hannibal or Napoleon.  A far better match would be Hitler....\\"<br />\\"[The Hellenic Siege engine] was impractical gigantism on a magnitude comparable to the contemporary B-2 American bomber....\\"<br />However, in the end of the day what this book does give the reader is a well detailed account of some of the most important battles of the classical Greek and Alexandrian campaigns.  Hanson focused primarily on infantry actions and comments little upon the naval engagements.  But his analysis of battles involving heavy infantry phalanxes is detailed, interesting and enlightening.  The illustrations of key battles serve as a useful visual guide to walk the reader through the events in sequence.  And good use is made of contemporary illustrations from vase painting and sculpture to support the analysis.<br />A useful read for those with an interest in military history who want to concentrate on battles and the tactics involved.ndrian campaigns.

US	49621826	R1RN9UFH47J9ZB	0156027321	843703088	Life of Pi	Books	5	1	2	N	N	A mad notion, made totally believable.	The Life of Pi is an engaging and endearing tale.  Son of a zoo-keeper, Pi Patel finds himself in a lifeboat with a fully grown Royal Bengal Tiger.  Adrift on the expanse of the Pacific Ocean he has no choice but to share the accommodation and make do with the arrangement.  The subsequent relationship of boy and tiger makes for fascinating reading.<br />The book is an exploration of the gamut of human emotions.  It runs from abject terror, through horror, disgust, innocent joy, excitement, resolution, defeat, boredom and so on.  Primary among the emotions examined are the nature of fear, and the resolve of purpose.  The author examines how fear can be our salvation or our undoing, it can kill us or save us.<br />By the end of the book we think we understand Pi Patel and his tiger, but Yann Martel throws us a final twist in the tale, which makes us question all our assumptions again.<br />Having read many of the accounts of survival on the ocean by sailors I can say that the life aboard this boat is accurately portrayed down to the finest detail.  Along the journey you learn a little about zoos and zoo keeping, the habits of animals and the art of survival at sea.  This is a great read, poignant, funny, bizarre and believable.	2003-10-06

In the first five books of the Uplift series David Brin treated us to the multitude of races populating the five galaxies.  But these were all oxy races, the oxygen breathers.  He has alluded to other races in previous books, but always kept them on the fringes.<br />In this thrilling finale to the Uplift series we are treated by introduction to the Hydrogen breathers, the Mechanoid life forms, members of the retired order from the Fractal world, Memetic life forms of folded space, and we are given a glimpse into the transcendant order of life.  In doing so Brin demonstrates the wonderful symmetry of the universe he has created.  He shows us that the universe is constantly in transition and is not the fixed system of the previous books.<br />The core tale of Streker and her cargo of progenitor relics, and the inhabitants of the Sooner Colony on Jijo is continued to a gripping conclusion.  The Siege of Earth, political squabbles, the outbreaks of religious fundamentalism and the fate of a small group of earthlings and jijoans are all resolved in this final offering.<br />At this stage all I can say is that this was a daunting project from the beginning for the reader.  I can only imagine what it was like for the Author.  It came off brilliantly and must stand in the annals of great science fiction.  Well Done David Brin!  (Applause Applause, Bravo!)	2003-09-24

What she has ended up with is a technically excellent novel, winner of the Booker prize, written in exquisite flowing prose which is coloured by Malayalam and the influences of children.<br />It is a story of a love affair that could not be, a child who should not have died, a man who should not have been killed and twins who should not have been separated.  This tale sits within the larger tapestry woven by a Syrian Christian family living in Kerala in India, tracing their lives from the backwards walking days of the British Raj to the present culture of daytime talkshows and world wrestling.<br />The main story is told in tantalising glimpses and teasing passages, laid out like a detective novel, with clues all along the way.  So when you get to the end, you know what happened, but still, you want the actors to play out their final scenes, just to be sure.<br />But at the end of the book I felt, yes, good story, beautiful language, and yet.....it all feels so managed.  As though Roy set out not to write a heartfelt story, but that from the beginning she intended it as a piece of crafted literature, something the critics would rave about.  Like the Kathkali dancer in her tale, who compromises his art to entertain bored tourists, I feel always that this story was pruned for display and in the process lost much of its passion.	2003-09-10
US	49621826	R3010JTWGM2VKZ	0441783589	242880671	Starship Troopers	Books	4	8	9	N	Y	Great action, great sci-fi, and interesting politics.	Most people have now seen Starship Troopers, the movie, filled with tongue in cheek action scenes, charting the rise of Jonnie Rico through the ranks of the Mobile Infantry.<br />The book is so much more.  It is strong on the military sci-fi elements, and gives a great run through boot camp and subsequent training.  The description of the first drop on the Skinnies world is excellent, filled with well thought out technology and tactics.<br />But throughout the book Heinlein uses his story to question our assumptions about the way we look at politics, universal sufferage, corporal punishment etc.  For instance, he points out that you cannot possibly have such a thing as a &quot;juvenile delinquent&quot;  since delinquency requires a sense of duty, and the thing that divides juveniles from adults is the appreciation of duty.  You can only be a delinquent once you accept your duty as an adult, and then fail to perform it.<br />The society on earth, ruled by &quot;Citizens&quot; who have the power to vote because they have demonstrated a concern for mankind above concern for the self is an interesting one.  It smacks a bit of military dictatorship, except of course, the veterans can't vote while in uniform.  The need to &quot;Earn&quot; the right to vote is not a bad concept.<br />Probably the most contraversial propositon is the use of corporal punishment to &quot;Train&quot; children and to punish adults.  Heinlein becomes totally simplistic when he likens the training of children to that of puppies, but even here he makes us question current structures that are clearly not working.<br />This was much more than the Military Sci-Fi novel that I was expecting.  It turned out to be a really good read, well worth a look.	2003-08-25

He neatly contrasts the fates of two islands that have been stripped of their heritage by english domination.  On one side of the world, right under the arms of her coloniser, lies the Isle of Mann, and across the globe lies Tasmania.<br />A crew of hapless Manx smugglers find themselves unexpectedly circumnavigating the globe to Tasmania to deliver a team of eminent english gentlemen to the antipodean island, where they intend to prove that the Bible was chronologically correct, that the earth is only 6,000 years old, and the rocks solidified according to \\"refrigeration theory\\".<br />The respectable scientists little suspect that they are travelling in a ship loaded to the gunwhales with contraband brandy, tobacco and naughty french paintings.  They spend the voyage picking at each other spitefully in a game of professional one upmanship.<br />Meanwhile in Tasmania, the aboriginal people are being systematically eraticated.  Midguided attempts to protect the inhabitants are more damaging to their population that shooting them on sight ever was.  We see the eradication of these gentle natives over the period of a single generation of colonisation.  This genocide is served in contrast to the cultural genocide in Mann caused by the anglicisation of the island and the loss of its unique language and customs.<br />Kneale has excelled in creating the different voices for his characters, the norse/celtic speech of Captain Kewley, the pseudo scientific claptrap of Dr Potter, the mealy mouthed whinging of the Reverend and the native/biblical creole of Peevay.  The comic elements of the book left me with tears in my eyes from laughing, as the Manx crew do their level best to see a profit from their smuggled goods.  But the lasting impression from this book is the sad fate of the tasmanian aborigine.	2003-07-30

With Infinity's shore Brin has taken what was a detailed and complex world from Brightness Reef (Book 4 in the uplift saga) and brought events forward to a real pitch of excitement.  He has the ability to weave greater and greater complexity into a plot that spans aeons of time, billions of years of planning, coming to a heady conclusion.<br />It isn't just the variety of races, each well explored in personality and physical traits.  It isn't just the sheer number of plot threads that makes this a brilliant series.  And it is not just the vision of such a universe.  It is the way Brin combines all the serried elements together with such consummate literary skill.  His prose is excellent and lapses into the poetic.  The uplift saga has to be one of the greatest achievements in science fiction writing, and deserves recognition from mainstream literary critics.<br />In this volume Brin reintroduces us to the remainder of the Streaker crew who fled Kithrup in Startide Rising (book 2) while continuing to develop the characters of the sooner races on Jijo.  And he demonstrates what makes a Jophur of a Traeki.  I can say no more without giving away plot elements.  Read it!	2003-07-23

Hamilton continues to develop the universe he has created, giving us a glimple into the Tyrathca society and suggesting that they have direct knowledge of the catastrophe that caused the collapse of Laymil civilization.<br />The stars of this book are the mechanically enhanced troops that are set down on Lalonde, both the hi-tech body enhancements and their Esprit de Corps and devil may care attitude to life, death and danger.<br />Needless to say I have purchased the next installment of the series, which amounts to six books in total, if you don't count short stories and add ons.<br />A great universe full of interesting characters, clever twists and unforseen developments.

Moore makes entertaining reading as he pulls down some of the sacred cows of American society.  Much of his rhetoric is overblown and exaggerated (Pure Irish Blarney) but this makes it a good hearty laugh. He is especially funny on the subject of 'the unelected leader of the USA' Mr G.W. Bush.<br />But underlying his funny poke at American society lie some very hard truths that have been properly researched by Moore.  Why do such a small number of media companies control the papers and TV news stations in the USA?  How can you have free speech where you have only one mouthpiece?<br />Who is educating American Kids and to what goal?  Why do Coke, McDonalds, Nike and Ford have free access to the classrooms?  <br />Who has access to the Whitehouse?  Why do so few Americans vote?  Why are there only two political parties in the land of democracy?  How have large corporations convinced ordinary americans to drink poisoned water so that their CEO's and CFO's can buy a second yacht and another corporate jet?

This is a brilliantly written book which tells a good story, but in a way that demonstrates the technical excellence of the writer.<br />The tale of the Heroine, Hope Clearwater, is told retrospectively by herself. Boyd cleverly puts himself into the first person so that he is believable as Hope herself. Then he has Hope speak of herself in first and third person, which creates an interesting effect. On the one hand you are viewing a narrative account of her story, but then you easily slip into her mind and listen to her thoughts. This makes the story very personal, and brings you close to Hope's character in an empathic way.<br />The story moves from College in England, to research in the downs of Southern England, before it leaps to Africa where things really hot up. Relationships move from civilised distraction to out and out bloodletting.<br />Boyd weaves in themes familiar from Jane Goodall and Diane Fossey's primate studies. He makes mathematics and research into interesting subjects, and is guaranteed to have you reaching for the dictionary to understand some of the obscure terminology of medieval english architecture. Over all of this he lays a central african civil war, academic cloak and dagger politics and some complex human and chimp relations.<br />Two love affairs that seem doomed, sexual politics in the bush and a shifting and uncertain movement of grant aid and civil war add to the complexity. A rebel army formed from a volleyball team, an egyptian cosmonaut, a half built hotel and the smallest model aircraft in the world inject the sense of ridiculous that is part of Africa.<br />A highly intelligent and enjoyable read.	2003-06-03
US	49621826	R3JVD439BWZGYX	0582064295	698828951	The Northern Wars: War, State and Society in Northeastern Europe, 1558 - 1721	Books	3	37	38	N	Y	An erudite collection of essays.	This book is a collection of discrete essays on the theme of the Baltic or Northern wars.  In the period following the end of the crusading in the Baltic region four key players emerged to contend for control of the crusader states.  These were Sweden, Denmark, Russia and Poland/Lithuania.<br />Frost analyses the rises and falls of the influence of each of the states over time with regard to a number of factors.<br />1.  He looks at the makeup of the military machines in each state.  The ratio of professional and conscript soldiers.  The makeup of the officer corps.  The percentage of cavalry to infantry.  The adoption of firearms, the development of the Huzzar to replace heavy cavalry, the failure of early mounted musketeers against Polish cavalry shock tactics and the ability of well drilled infantry to frustrate cavalry ambitions as practiced by the Swedes.<br />2.  He looks at the relationship between ruler and state, from the wholly autocratic Russian system to the almost democratic Polish and Lithuanian system.  The income of ruler and state such as the ability of Danish kings to act autonomously of their parliament due to the money from sound dues etc.<br />3.  He looks (most interesting to me) at the ability of nations to fund war.  The cost of standing armies and mercenaries.  The need to vote extraordinary funds to armies in times of national peril.  The difference in support given to rulers by landowner classes in periods of defence against an agressive neighbour and in periods of national expansion.  His analysis of the economics of war is where Frost excels.<br />4.  He also places the northern wars in their temporal, historical and geographical context by commenting on the developments in Western Europe, the 30 years war, the wars of the protestant reformation, the expansion of the Ottoman Turks in the south of the region, the incursions by Tatars from the asian steppes etc.<br />5.  He analyses the impact of war on the societal makeup of the countriesin the region.  How landownership and serfdom developed, the evolution of the Cossack class, and so on.<br />If you are looking for an adventure story about knights charging into battle this is probably not the book for you.  If you are looking for real history on the different approaches that can be taken to wage war, and how these strategies played out in short and long term, then this is a very useful read.<br />Because they are discrete essays it is possible to deal with them one at a time.  Although the essays move chronologically through time, they deal with different sets of players and different types of tensions.  Frost strives to uncover why any given set of strategies was successful in the time period where they worked.	2003-05-12

Most people at this stage have seen Blade Runner the excellent film adaptation of this book.  But it is important to remember that the movie is an adaptation, one which explores certain themes within the book.  But it does not explore all the issues raised in the book, and it is only one interpretation.<br />The book explores a number of important and universal themes.  One is the theme of love and care and empathy.  It contrasts the attitudes of various individuals in terms of how much they can love or empathise with other creatures.  Why is an electric sheep less deserving of love than a real one?  Why are androids less deserving of love than people?  Why do we objectivise some beings and empathise with others?  What does our love for other people or animals say about us as people?<br />Dick sharply contrasts the empathy of humans with the coldness of androids in the spider leg incident.  This scene is powerful and disturbing.<br />The book delves into the area of social status, as evinced by animal ownership.  Deckard is prepared to beggar himself to have a large animal.  Size matters, it is a statement of self worth, but in Dicks world it goes even further than this.  Animal ownership is equated with humanity.  To own an animal and care for it is not only a statement of career success, it is a statement of personal worth as an individual.<br />The book also explores themes such as intellectual discrimination (Chickenheads), future slavery and rights of synthetic life forms, spirituality and religion.  The interlacing of spiritual aspects into this book is done extremely well.  The appearance of Mercer and his interaction with the real world does not jar at all.  It is well handled by phasing in the spirituality at a time of extreme psychological stress.<br />All in all this is an intelligent and thoughtful book.  Dont think you know the story because you saw the film.  There is much more in here than ever made it onto the screen.	2003-05-07

From the beginning this book reads like a drug induced hallucination.  Jason Taverner loses his identity and finds himself caught in limbo in a controlled police state where those without papers are criminals.  Can he get back to his reality, or did his reality ever actually exist.  Are all his memories simply a narcotic trip that has ended?<br />In case you are wondering where you have heard of this idea before, it is explored in the short story \\"We can remember it for you wholesale\\" which was made as the movie \\"Total Recall\\".<br />Taverners new state of being introduces him to a side of life that he was unaware of, a frightening no mans land that he is unequipped to survive in.<br />The characters he meets are equally disturbing, the manic identity card forger, the incestuous police chief with a penchant for weeping and his fetishistic sister who comes to police HQ to sleep off her drug overdoses.<br />In the book the author makes some interesting predictions of things that have happened, cybersex (which he calls telephone orgies) being the most luridly notable, surround sound music systems is another, and he points to the growth in use of cellular phones.  Other predictions are either way off the mark or have not happened yet.  Cars have not been replaced by flyers, and the black population of the USA is certainly not an endangered species.  And if the US military has a H-bomb the size of a seed that can be planted under the skin they aren't broadcasting the fact yet!<br />He also briefly explores the concept of genetic enhancement and a race of superhumans.<br />But what is most interesting about this book for me is the style of the prose.  It seems disassociated from the subject, poetic at times, and objective.  You never feel as though you are within the experience, everything is viewed through a lens, or a TV screen.  This makes the story less personal, and as a result, less believable.  The reader is less inclined to suspend disbelief, so you are always aware that this is fiction and not reality.	2003-04-30

It was my first introduction to Peter Hamilton, and I am sold.<br />The book spans a grand universe with varied planets and habitats, alien races, FTL travel, and one of the key drivers of the book is the split of mankind into Edenist (bioengineered humans) and Adamists (fundamentalist creationist humans).<br />Without spoiling the plot I can say that this book introduces the reader to a variety of characters and plotlines and sets up a compelling story to follow.  There is a good mix of sci-fi technology material (organic spaceships and habitats, space ships and lasers) with primitive fantasy style elements (backward planets with low tech environments).<br />I can honestly say I am hooked and have ordered book 2 already!	2003-04-24

It is a mark of the quality of this book that it has never been out of print since it was published several decades ago.  This is the book that started the genre of alternative history.  He throws his hero, Martin Padway, into dark ages Rome with only the contents of his pockets and his wits.  Can a modern man make a comfortable life for himself in the ancient world?<br />It is a short read, but very well written.  Le Camp builds us a time travel theory and a whole world in the past without needing to engage in in-depth world building.  And for students of Byzantine history, it covers an interesting era when Justinian tried to reel the Ostrogothic run Italy back into the Eastern Roman Empire.  Apart from the alternative elements the book is very historically correct.<br />As a bonus you get the David Drake novella &quot;To bring the light&quot; another alternative history about the founding of Rome.	2003-01-27

Evil characters from the first two books, like Sandor Clegane and Jamie and Tywin Lannister, are developed so that we gain sympathy for them, understanding their motivations better.

In his first three uplift novels Brin concentrated on introducing the galactic players (Sundiver) uplifted Dolphins (Startide Rising) and uplifted Chimps (The Uplift War).<br />Now he introduces us to a new world populated by five different and interesting races.  He shows us the world through the eyes of Hoon, Traeki, Urs, G'kek, Qhuen and Human.  He shows us a fallow world which is recovering from civilization, and also introduces the concept of the \\"Path of Redemption\\" a slide back from civilization to primitivism.<br />Backing up this world is the fear of being found tresspassing on a fallow world by galactic agencies, and the threat to Humans that carries over from the first series, the great secret that the Dolphins found which is causing galaxy wide conflict.<br />The climax of this book is towards the end and is a pointer to the next in the series.

US	49621826	R18AWADJIRWVNR	1563151448	194602540	Wysard	Books	4	5	5	N	Y	Poetic in language and treatment.	Wysard reads more like a heroic medieval warrior romance than a fantasy novel.  The language is grander and more poetic than the run of the mill fantasy novel.  This, for me anyway, gives it the feel of one of those translated stories from the golden age of Amour Courtois, the Song of Roland, the Morte D'Arthur, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight etc.<br />The use of magic arts in the novel is (thankfully) used as a subtext to the more important issues of personal character, friendship, kinship and love.<br />A piece of advice often given to journalists is to write a piece, and then take out the best line in the edit.  Because this is likely to be the most self-indulgent writing.  If I were to edit Wysard I would cut the first line to ribbons.  I found it intimidating.  But don't be put off by it.  The rest of the book is really well written, unlike that frightening opening line.<br />When the book ended I felt I was only getting a feel for Ryel Mirai, and others have commented on the inappropriateness of the cut of this book into two volumes.  Publishers- what can I say!<br />Wysard does not suffer from that disease of many fantasy writers, the interminable need to build world upon world until the books run to multiple volumes (we could call it WOT syndrome).  Her world is drawn with a few simple brush strokes, but is no less colorful or detailed for all the brevity.  Surely the mark of a great writer.  And may we please see more?	2002-11-07

It is the book that introduces you to the world of David Brin's Uplift War.  He has to give you a lot of concept building data on the aliens, their alliances, the galactic library etc.  As a result, it is a book that takes a bit of perseverence.<br />The reward comes as you dig deeper into the series, because what Brin has created is one of the greatest Sci-Fi classics.  It is a complex universe of patron and client races that operates like feuding Italian Medieval states.  Humans are a small player in this canvas, and one mistake can doom them to slavery forever.<br />I wholeheartedly recommend this series to anyone who has an interest in hard sci-fi which explores possible futures.	2002-08-28

Being harsh on this one I have to say that it is more in the realms of fantasy or occult than Science Fiction.  There is a  distinct avoidance by the author of any logical explanations for what happens.  We have people swapping bodies, magical gates opening through time, magical &quot;hooks&quot; to bring you back, and lots of macabre cripples and characters in the sewers of London.  Really the stuff of horror and occult books.<br />But all that said - it is a good read.  The pace is blistering and you have to keep up to remember who is in which body today.  The story rips around the globe like an Indiana Jones movie, with the added attraction of leaping through time.<br />I don't want to give too much away, but I really felt it was a bit rich to have the main character give away all his good clothes upon his entry to old London, and accept rags - thereby sealing his fate at the bottom of the food chain.  Had he been robbed it would have been more plausible.<br />As for Horrobins &quot;Mistakes&quot; - a bit of explanation would have been useful.  What exactly was he trying to make?  Beats me!<br />I think Powers would have done better to put a bit more logical motive into his story, to hold it together.  I liked Horrobins character, and Dog-Face Joe.  The description of the &quot;Master&quot; could have been filled in a bit more.<br />As I say, a fun book - but a bit uneven in places.	2002-08-19

This is undoubtedly a valuable piece of work, chronicling the history of christian and germanic expansion into the wild Baltic region of the middle ages.<br />However, it is not an easy read.  There are long tedious passages of historical fact, detailing which Swedish or Danish King sent how many troops to which river, and if they were or were not successful.  Little detail is given of the human perspective of this conflict.  Christiansen relies heavily on a summarisation of chronicles to present a dry factual account of the incursions of various kings and monastic orders into the region.<br />If you are seeking information on what happened, you will find it if you persevere.  If you are looking for an entertaining or palatable account of the northern crusades, look elsewhere.  This is not it.	2002-06-28

What this book gives is a broad picture of what you are trying to achieve when you play chess.  It takes you above the region of move by move analysis and sets you the task of viewing the game as a strategic whole.  If you can grasp this high level view of the game of chess, you have a better chance of improving your game.  This is a book about the thinking behind chess and the strategy element, as opposed to tactics.<br />Very short, very readable and entertaining, and a useful companion to quite a high level.	2002-06-28

It spans galaxies and thousands of years with the story of Pham Newen, and it spans three cultures with the tales of the Interstellar Traders, the Emergent Humans and the Spiders.  <br />The alien spider culture in this book is brilliantly antrophomorphised by Vinge by a brilliant technique that I won't spoil for you here.  The complexity of the spider culture is developed in great detail and we develop a real feel for their personalities.<br />Vinge is a magnificent writer and he has put all of his energy and creativity into this excellent book.  I simply cannot recommend it enough.  If you like serious hard sci-fi or military sci-fi there is a lot to be gleaned from it.  If you like &quot;cultural&quot; sci-fi or even just a great story, you will still be totally in your element.  And for those who love political stories this is a tale which contains wheels within wheels within wheels.	2002-06-28

For those who don't know, the series begins with Sundiver which introduces the concept of uplift and some of the Galactic species.<br />The series was developed by Startide Rising, where we see the crew of a Fen ship (Neo-dolphins) trying to elude capture by alien fleets.<br />In this book, we are introduced to the world of the Chen, the uplifted neo-chimpanzees.  We gain an insight into the differences between Chen and Humans, and we are brought more deeply into an appreciation of three of the alien races, the birdlike Gubru, the Thenanin and the Tymbrimi.<br />Of the three books to date this is the most rounded and satisfying story.  In addition the characters are solid and believable, so that we develop a real affection for Fiben Bolger, a chimp, we understand the level of affection possible between alien races, and we see something of how alien thinking works in the Gubru.<br />This book also gives us a better feel for the power of galactic protocol and for the role of the library in interspecies affairs.<br />I am hooked on Uplift now, and I have to move on and read the next installment.  If they keep getting better with each book as they have been doing, I am in for a real treat.	2002-06-28

Because of this Bear has been able to eliminate much of the world building that Robinson faced.<br />Instead we are grounded in a Mars society which is established, a frontier colony of Earth, ruled by independent extended family groups.  The basic tenets of life on Mars are told in passing, the fact that Martians have as many words for sand as Eskimo have for snow makes total sense.  The reluctance of Martians to venture topside is also logical.  Their foray's to the surface are similar to the Earth man's relationship with the sea.<br />The meat of the story is in two parts.  On the one hand is the perpetual struggle for power that frames all our lives.  Earth based alliances are demanding a centralised form of Government on Mars to give more control over Martian activities and to simplify the processes of trade and colonisation.  The Martian's, used to their independence, resist the fall into a centralised authority.  But the Earth has unlimited resources, vile weapons and seems to be able to stamp it's will onto fledgeling Mars.<br />But the other strand, the heart of the Science in this book, revolves around a way to alter the universe which opens doors to new and powerful weapons, interplanetary communications and exciting travel possibilities.  Earth suspects that Mars knows something, and uses every tool at their disposal to winkle it out.<br />Will Mars be dragged back under Earth Control?  Will Earth have to destroy Mars?  Will the Martians unleash damnation upon the Earth?  Is there another solution.   Of course the title is a bit of a give away, but the book draws you in to a will they won't they at the end.<br />This is a good solid piece of work, with believable science and more believable colonisation of Mars and the Moon.  The progress of society on Earth also makes for interesting reading.  Bear has a great imagination and an ability to make possibility seem real.  A really worthwhile read.	2001-12-04

This helps to put the work of Sun Tzu into a hisorical context.<br />Furthermore, the use of Sun Tzu by Mao Zedong (Chairman Mao) who brought the world's attention to the Art of War, is explored.<br />The translation itself is handled in as straightforward a manner as possible to put the sections of the work into context.  Sun Tzu reads like a checklist of things you have to do, or not do, to achieve success.  But each point on the checklist summarises a wealth of experience and argument.<br />A must for any politician, military officer or senior businessmen, and anyone writing about politics, war or business.	2001-12-04

It is not a history of Lee, but a list of lessons illustrated by events in his career.<br />The lessons are laid out chronologically in Lee's career. They highlight as much about his strengths as his weaknesses.  More importantly for me, they give an insight into the Civil War that is uniquely from the perspective of General Lee.<br />This is a book that can appeal to Civil War readers, or it can appeal to those interested in Management.<br />It is an easy read, I like the style, and it is a book that you can stop and start as you like.

If you want to learn how to conduct a war this book has to be one of the basic texts.<br />O'Ballance clearly and factually analyses the socio-political run-up to the war without getting bogged down in splitting hairs.<br />He then moves to an explanation of the war.  He does this theatre by theatre, beginning with the Air war, followed by the Sinai campaign, then the war against Jordan, the Syrian campaign in the Golan heights and finally the naval actions.<br />In each section he establishes the strenghts of the players with detailed descriptions of the numbers and types of materiel (Aircraft, Tanks, Artillery, etc).<br />He analyses the types of troops available to each side, the qualities of the officers, the &quot;management&quot; style, the troop morale.<br />Then he illustrates the actions, using detailed maps to aid commentary, analysing as the actions progress what was going right or wrong.<br />Finally he summarises each action and its impact on the other elements of the war.<br />The Six-Day war is a lesson in the need for domination of the skies in desert warfare.  Without total air superiority it is certain that the deep egyptian lines of defence in the Sinai would have held.  This would have given the Jordanians, Syrians and Iraqis time to mobilise against Israel.<br />The Israeli strategy to fight the war outside of Israel is an important lesson for small nations.<br />The independence of Israeli units and in particular the ability of tank commanders to act when isolated, was a key to success in the confusion of battle.  Israelis trusted their junior officers to act to fulfill an overall general plan.  The Egyptians on the other hand, were constantly looking for direction from above, which was useless given the speed with which circumstances changed.  This is an important lesson not only for military, but also for management.<br />Overall an excellent historical read, and a brilliant lesson in tactics, strategy and delegation.	2001-11-01

Huxley's Brave New World has often been described as a chilling prediction of a sterile future world where people are genetically engineered into 'castes' and are unable to advance or better themselves.<br />But is this such a bad world?  Someone has to clean toilets.  Someone has to sweep streets and collect garbage.  Would it not be better to have these jobs done by people who are happy with their lives.  In Brave New World everyone below the top caste is inbred with an awe for the Alpha group who are the leaders, movers and shakers of the world.  There is no fear of rebellion.  People live lives of peace, harmony and tranquility.<br />So what is wrong with this picture?  Why do we so fear the very things we seek?  What is it in human nature that we want the savage to take root amongst us and tear down our sacred cows?  Indeed the savage is the only 'personality' in this book.<br />Brave New Word is relevant because it questions our view of the society we want.  In reality we do not want to live a life of social outings and days on the golf course.  Man needs adversity in order to thrive.  What is it in the nature of man that craves hardship, dirt, pain and risk?  What does it say about us as a race?<br />If you haven't read this book, you should.  It is one of those must reads which can change the way you think about life.  In style it is short, sterile and spare, a reflection perhaps, of life in the Brave New World.  There is no adventure here, no great story that will thrill you.  But this is a book you will not forget.	2001-10-04

It is unfortunate that I happened to begin with the dregs of short stories written by different people.  This is obviously an attempt to captialise on what must have been a good series.<br />This book does not stand on its own.  As far as I can tell the Bolos are just very big tanks that can do a bit of thinking for themselves.  After that it's a case of bang bang flash, ten year old kid's stuff with ray guns.  No characterisation, no empathy with the characters, who they defend or the &quot;dreaded&quot; enemy.  Nothing.  This is cheap thin cardboard and is just the kind of rubbish that should not be published.<br />Whoever the editor and publisher are - shame on you.  There are too many good books waiting to be published to put this trash on the shelves.  Go hang your heads in shame.<br />There is so little substance in this book, it is impossible to really attack it.  How can you attack something without substance.  I want my money back!	2001-09-11
US	49621826	R3RXGJMLK82YY	0061059722	413464205	Brothers in Arms	Books	3	3	3	N	Y	Great story, too big for such a tight book.	Brothers in Arms falls into the category of Military Sci-Fi. In the tradition of these novels it is short, punchy, heavy on technology and light on plot or characterisation. It draws heavily on books such as Haldeman's \\"Forever War\\" and Steakleys \\"Armour\\". For me I think it lacks the punch that Forever War displays, but is better written than either of the above books. The standard genre elements such as the basic military setting, the hard cadet training and the soldier being thrown into war at the deep end are all fleshed out by other elements. There is the Alliance/Colony power struggle which erupts into Civil War, so that the cadets are pitted against each other rather than some faceless enemy. There is a racist undertone of being a colonist, and the worse stigma of being a genetic freak. There is the poorly understood technology of a disappeared race, and what exactly it does to you. Because Weaver has actually done his research and constructed a plausible galaxy for us, there are enticing visions of worlds and ideas that lie outside the story. Weaver is obviously keeping back a larger picture and letting us see only a glimpse of this world. This may be a prelude to a series of books, or it may merely be good technical writing skill. I have not given Brothers in Arms a great rating because I think the book fails in a number of its key objectives. Weaver wanted to show us the transmogrification of his central character from uncertain idealistic boy to a pragmatic and confident officer. In this he fails. The character at the end seems to me no different from the one at the beginning. I felt the characterisation of Halitov (the sidekick) was better managed and the layers beneath him were explored better. Also, there are issues in the book that needed better development, such as the political ramifications of the split between colonies and alliance etc. I suppose it is a feature of Mil/Sci/Fi that you get only the grunts view of the world. I like to see things on abroader canvas and for that reason I find the genre unsatisfying. I think Weaver had the makings of a great speculative fiction novel here but that he harnessed it to the wrong genre, a bit like hitching a racehorse to a cart. If you have got to the bottom of this review you will probably feel much the same as me about the book. Those who lost interest in my review in the first paragraph will probably get a kick out of it. Plenty of bang bang flash and guts falling out.	2001-08-27

This book starts off as a story about a private passion, and takes us through Mason's classes learning to fly helicopters. From there it turns into a novel like Conrads &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;. The book takes you deeper and deeper in small incremental steps until at the end you glimpse the personal private hell of one mans vision of war. When I put the book down I literally gasped. Mason drops you in so fast you just don't see it coming. The transition is brilliant and effective. Mason really makes you see his inner soul in a way I have never seen before. And because he takes you with him in his joyous flights from training school to the war in Vietnam, you are still with him when he falls down hard on his return. A great book if you like helicopters, even better if you don't like helicopters.	2001-08-27

It is set post the melting of the polar Ice caps, land is at a premium and the US have tightened their borders so that the immigration authorities behave like a combined Coastguard, CIA, FBI and Secret Police. The heroine Patricia Beenan, finds something that sets off a train of events in the highest state circles and in her own life. Obviously I am not going to say more as it would spoil the fun. But it involves fun and stealth games in a high tech micro submarine, life aboard a floating city, a little food, a little wine and a little romance. Drawbacks in this book? Well, I felt the whole development of the socio-economic climate post holocaust could have been developed more, but that's just me and it would be boring to most readers. I loved the injection of spanish throughout the book, but that's because I speak the language and it gave me the opportunity to practice. For a non hispanophile I think it might grate after a while. All in all I found it an enjoyable read, not cerebral stuff, a nice passer of time on a holiday.	2001-08-25

I am now on the crusty side of my 30's and they remain as vivid for me now as when I read them.  This trilogy is a great adventure story and makes great Science Fiction reading.<br />The world is in ruin, and has been taken over by aliens who have enslaved the people.  The job of saving the earth from the aliens falls to a group of young teenagers, because when they become adults everyone is fitted with a mind control device which prevents rebellion.<br />The characters in the story have to escape having the device placed on them.  Then they have to travel to the white mountains where the resistance is said to hide.  To get there they must make a long and dangerous journey across a continent.<br />I really strongly recommend this trilogy to teenagers and hopefully it will give them the interest in reading that I maintain today.	2001-08-17

Overall I am recommending this book if you want to understand what happened at Balaclava and you know little or nothing about the Crimean campaign.  But I have serious reservations about this book that may be useful for you to be aware of.  Let me be clear first of all - I think this is a good book, I recommend it, but with the following provisios.<br />1.  There is an over emphasis early on in the book on the lives and experiences of Lords Cardigan and Lucan, their private lives, childhood experience and record of marriages.  As an Irish man I found Lucan's actions during the great potato famine to be of interest, but it was entirely off the point.  The Irish Potato famine has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the Charge of the Light Brigade.  A lot of this could be cut out.<br />2.  There is no good explanation of the tactics of troops and in particular of Cavalry in this period.  The author fails to make it clear how cavalry should operate and how this differs from the way Raglan insisted upon the cavalry staying close to the troops.<br />3.  The book is light on statistics.  There is a lot of commentary on the Cholera epidemic, but how serious was it?  What percentage of troops died of Cholera?  How many died in battle?  This kind of information puts events in perspective.<br />4.  The book is written almost exclusively from the British Point of View.  At times you can forget that the French were even there.  It would be useful to have analysed the reasons for the Crimean conflict from the perspective of Britain, France, Russia and Turkey.  Did the Sultan invite the English and French to act on his behalf???<br />5.  For me Raglan is the culpabale party.  He was commander in the field.  He allowed a brigade commander to believe he was independent of his divisional commander.  He removed the divisional commander from his division.  He interfered with the management of the command.  He restricted the actions of cavalry to behaving like infantry.  In battlehe put himself in positions where he could not communicate with his troops.  This was particularly acute in Alma, when he got onto the Russian side, over a mile from the main advance, and could not order supporting actions.<br />6.  The book stops after the charge, without fully explaining the final outcome of the campaign or its consequences.<br />Overall I feel this is a book with too many holes in it.  I am itching to have a go at improving upon it myself.  Were I the authors teacher in school I would probably have written something like &quot;good effort, well written lots of hard work, but you need to stick to the point and draw clear conclusions.&quot;	2001-08-13

The depth of characterisation, the scope of the tale, the range of peoples, houses and alliances all make for a complex and thrilling read.<br />This book develops more in the region of sorcery than the original.  Old magics are awakening, and I just hope that they don't grow to dominate the series.  I prefer the Sword to the Sorcery in these stories.<br />If there was any other disappointment for me it was in the failure of grand battles to materialise.  I don't think Martin has the knack of being able to describe the grand movements of military hosts.  His largest canvas was a huge naval battle, and it quickly became a confusing parade of ships names and uncertain outcomes.<br />Disappointments aside, the plot continues to thicken nicely and I will buy the third installment.  However, I do not want to see another Robert Jordan series (wheel of time is into book what?....9 or 10?).  I do not intend to pay for Mr Martins retirement, so if conclusions are not being alluded to by book three I may take my custom elsewhere.	2001-08-02

It has reallys stood the test of time, both in terms of the technologies described and in relation to potential socioeconomic changes in Earth and further afield.

This dedication to revenge galvanises him to learn, create build and do all a good man can do, but all in the name of destruction.<br />Foyle is thief, rapist, killer, liar, and yet manages to retain his position as the &quot;hero&quot; of the tale.

Aulus Perennius is a roman imperial spy who is recruited by a mysterious person to help track down and destroy a small group of aliens who have landed in the Roman Empire.<br />Drake tells a good fast paced story within a well researched Roman Empire setting which gives the book a good authentic feel.  He avoids the worst excesses of ray-gun sci-fi, while introducing comic elements such as an early christian cult who try a little too hard to worship the cruxicifiction, a displaced allosaurus who has a taste for donkeys and a nerve wracking naval battle in a hundred year old ship which is ready to fall apart.<br />A highly enjoyable read which won't put too much strain on the brain cells.

Based loosely upon the fall of the Moorish kingdoms of Spain to Ferdinand and Isabella, &quot;The Lions of Al Rassan&quot; tells the tale of an unlikely love triangle.  Belmonte, the tough soldier from the Jaddite lands and Ammar el Kairan, the Poet, Warrior and Diplomat from Al Rassan adopt a posture of mutual respect and admiration, while competing for the love and respect of the beautiful and intelligent lady doctor from a despised race.  About them, events conspire to tear down the world that makes their love and their very existence possible.<br />Al Rassan, in all its corrupt splendor, is collapsing.  With it is falling the art, the poetry and the beauty.  On both sides religious fanatics with no love of art vie for the ownership of the prize.<br />This is a wonderful and nostalgic tale of heroism, bravery, love and romance told in the way only Guy Gavriel Kay can do it.  The inevitability of the fall takes nothing from the book, and if possible it adds a frisson of pathos which makes us regret the loss of Al Rassan all the more.	2001-05-22

This time he has crossed to &quot;the enemy&quot; in Makuran and is telling the stories of that side of the world.<br />This book tells the story of Abivard, a lord from a small but loyal family who makes a king and marries his sister to the king.  As a result he finds himself thrown into a senior military command and enmeshed in the complex politics of the world of Makuran.  As he becomes increasingly distanced from his ruler Abivard must prove his loyaly, keep his holdings and protect his family.<br />It sets up the plot nicely for the second book of the series.	2001-05-22

In Startide Rising Brin throws us a few decades forward from Sundiver, the first of the Uplift books.<br />In this book we see less of the complexities of the galactics and more of the effects of uplift.  The mission is led by uplifted dolphins, with some humans and a chimp on board.  We join the mission as they flee competing galactic fleets with a valuable secret on board.<br />What follows is a complex plot of Delphin politics as two factions vie for control of their stricken ship.  A new race ready for uplift.  A complex ebb and flow of galactic alliances in planetary orbit fighting for  control of the &quot;secret&quot;.  <br />Woven into all of this we have layers of dolphin communication in Whalesong, Primary, Trinary and Anglic, with humans speaking Human anglic and english.  Add to that languages from Galactic one to twelve and you begin to glimpse the depth of Brins vision.  This is no simple phaser blasting military sci-fi novel.  It is a well crafted and complex tale set in a well thought out reality.<br />I now need to move to book number three.	2001-05-22

I am totally hooked and I have now signed up for the sequels.  This is the very best of fantasy literature.  It is fast paced and exciting with a huge cast of charachters in a sprawling and diverse landscape.<br />At first I was despairing at the sheer number of people I was trying to follow, but Martin manages the characterisations very well so that each individual stands out clearly in the mind.<br />This is more a &quot;sword&quot; than a &quot;sorcerer&quot; fantasy book, and that is something I appreciate.  But don't despair, there were dragons once and there is a possibility that there will be dragons again.  Don't you just love possibility.<br />I can't wait to get into the next book.  I just hope Martin can write fast enough to keep me interested.  For lovers of Tolkien, Eddings, Jordan and Feist come aboard and read this one.  You will not be disappointed.  Buy it now - winter is coming.	2001-04-12

The bear in this book is just so big.  Kids love to see such a big bear get into the house.  He makes a mess of the bed and the bathroom, he dirties the floor which has to be cleaned up (good introduction to pets for children) and all the while the adults keep missing him.  They just cannot manage to catch a glimpse of this huge bear wandering around their house.<br />This is a magical and imaginative book which my kids love.  It takes a bit of reading at first, but once you get the gist of the story it is easy to lead the children from picture to picture, and it is very well illustrated.  It reads almost like a TV programme.<br />Highly recommended by me.  Suits from 2 year olds up to six or seven.	2001-04-11

At first you can tell the story, then the kids identify all the pictures of the food the caterpillar eats and they begin to shout them out.

Pratchett is irreverent in his disregard for the Gods of fantasy and indeed the norms of rational explanation.<br />He mercilessly slays all the carefully thought out theories of modern science in his creation Diskworld.  Just when you think he is going to give a &quot;scientific&quot; explanation for the occurance of something an imp or a dryad hops out and claims the deed.<br />He tinkers with language in a hilarious way, just look at the titles and you can see this coming through.  The edge of diskworld (a world suspended on the backs of elephants which stand on a turtle) is prevented from falling off by the Circumfence (not the circumference, it is a fence around the edge).<br />The strongest character in the book has to be the luggage, which is stronger even than Hrun the Barbarian.  The luggage follows Twoflower the tourist and Rincewind the unwizardly wizard around on their adventures by walking on its many little feet.<br />This is a book that revels in being funny by breaking all the unwritten conventions.  It is irreverent in the extreme and for this reason I suspect that I will be buying a few more of this series.  I love a good intelligent laugh!	2001-03-23

Students have to wear special suits to protect them from the aliens.  <br />The Ayan language is peripheral and non-direct, making mastery of it elusive to straight talking humans.<br />The story is set against the backdrop of a world divided between the haves and the have nots, those who have embraced the technology of the aliens and those who avoid it.  And the symbol of Ayan technology is the Fine Hunt.<br />This is a well written and very intelligent book which sets a good xenophobic theme in a Sci-fi context with a wealth of futuristic technological themes running through it.

This is a short, engaging and beautifully written book about the horrors of life in a Siberian Gulag.  What is best about the book is that, in the words of Oscar Wilde &quot;although we are all in the gutter, some of us are looking at the stars&quot;.  This a book about hope, about getting the best from a bad lot.<br />It does not matter if you are in a Gulag or in a boring job, or struggling with a marriage or family or what ever.  You personally have the ability to see things as good or as bad, and how you perceive your life determines how you will enjoy it.<br />The protagonist in this book does his best, he works for the simple joy of a job well done, he delights in an extra bowl of porridge, and as a result his day is a good one.  The full horror of his sentence is kept at bay by taking it one day at a time.<br />If you want an introduction to Solzhenitsyn this is the book for you.  Don't believe all the stuff about political satire, don't try to work out if the boots are a metaphor for something in Russian Government, just read the words and revel in them.<br />Word for word this is one of the greatest books ever written.	2001-01-09

It has great ideas to begin with.  It is set on a spaceship which is a travelling university, flitting from human planet to human planet in the colonised universe.  We have an engine accident.  The aliens who run the engines seem to be killing each other, but behind closed doors.  There is a planet which was civilized but is devoid of life.  Someone has sabotaged the messaging system.  The university president is lying to the captain.  The campus security seem to be working for the religious orders.  The university free press has been closed down.  Administration and faculties are at each others throats, and behind all of this you get the feeling that what happens here will impact upon the future of mankind.  <br />Plots, sub-plots and potential conspiracies abound in a taughtly written and engaging book.  I challenge anyone to be able to call the ending of this one.  It is just not a predictable read.  Well worth the purchase, this is one of the good ones!	2001-01-02

A fast paced book told in small chapters.  It raises many questions about our society.  Do we need &quot;different&quot; people to keep society alive?  Does society stagnate when it is comfortable?  Do deformed people have an individuality and strength that makes them more resourceful?  Do we mourn the passing of ugly people less than the passing of beautiful people?<br />Picture yourself being dumped on a planet, alone and virtually unarmed, in the certain knowledge that all who went before have disappeared off the face of the universe.  Would you go?  Even if you were trained to do so?<br />Intrigued by these premises?  Then read on.

I have had a lot of double takes reading this book.  How could anyone have got away with so much for so long.  There is no doubt that Frank could have put away a retirement sum and gone to ground into retirement for the rest of his life, but why would he?  He had so much fun.  He lived everyones dreams, to be a pilot, a lawyer, a doctor, a lecturer, and all without even a high school diploma!  My favourite part has to be where he recruits his own &quot;flight crew&quot; of stewardesses and takes them on an all expenses paid tour of europe, on rubber cheques.<br />Obviously a highly intelligent individual Frank ascribes his success to being well turned out, paying attention to people and doing your research.  I have to say that's good advice for life!<br />It is no surprise to me that he now works in the business of closing all the loopholes that he himself exploited.  <br />It is well worth reading about the escapades of this (semi) moral crook who only robbed institutions, not individuals, except for a particularly mean prostitute!  A great and surprisingly light read.  Your cheque book will never look the same after you read this book!	2000-11-07

It took me thirty pages to realise that Oxper was an abbreviation for Auxuliary Personnel, and that this meant anderoids.  I couldn't figure out the difference between Silvos, Silver Cross and the people wearing silver suits.  I eventually figured out that Silvo was an abbreviation for Silver Cross and that they wore blue suits while the Crew, who are not silver cross, wear silver suits from time to time.  Confused?  Welcome to the club.  <br />I eventually got fed up trying to work out silly little enigmas like these, I lost whatever plot there was, failed to identify with any of the characters, and so the book has been dropped, unfinished.  This, from me, is a testament to a bad book.  I have finished some pretty bad stuff in my day, I am a finisher, and for me not to finish, the book has to stink like a skunk in a farting contest.

Perhaps some people love Bonaparte too much.  I knew little about the subject going in to it, but I have to say this book has proved to be and education.<br />Schom has taken a critical stance of Napolean, and that is fine.  It is clear that sometimes he can be overly critical of Bonapartes brilliance on the field of battle and his organisational skills.  Lets face it, you don't become the ruler of Europe by being a bungler.  <br />But what Schom does highlight is that Napolean was human, and that his flaws were there from the beginning to be exploited.  That others failed to exploit his flaws is one of the reasons for his success.  <br />I say this book is worth the price, has provided me with both enjoyment and education, and if you want to know M.Bonaparte intimately you could do a lot worse than to read this one.	2000-10-13

This is one of the best sci-fi books I have ever read, and if you read many of my reviews you will realise that I do not say this lightly, nor do I often award five stars for anything.<br />This is an intriguing and intelligent book set in a world where women dominate life in great families of female clones and where men are the lesser species.  Both species are ruled by sexual urges, but at different times of the year, Summer for men and Winter for women.  The  result is a stagnant population level.<br />We follow two sisters who are of low status because they are Summer babies, not clones, who travel together to pretend they are clone sisters.  They run into a man from &quot;normal&quot; humankind who has come to bring this planet back into the human collective and is imprisoned by the great families who do not want their stable society disrupted.<br />This is a great adventure story told against the backdrop of a rich history on a planet that is moving slowly away from technology in a reverse development towards an agrarian existence.  The great families of clone sisters are the equivalent of medieval feudal families who kept Europe in stagnant thrall for so long in the middle ages.<br />This book is in some ways like 1984 by George Orwell, where the great families take the role of big brother to keep things stable, but in a feminine, non agressive way.<br />The book is littered with sub plots, each rich and full in its own way, a drug running scam, a war with an extraterrestrial species, the story of setting up the planet and the genetic enhancements required to adapt humans to it, the travels of the sisters and the game of life played by the sailors.<br />The worst thing about this book is that it ever ends.  This is a world you want to stay in because it is so full and interesting.	2000-10-13

I travelled to Crete on a package holiday and stayed in the popular (read overdeveloped) resort of Hersonnosis.  I found that the Rough Guide had no interest in covering this particular area and is particularly scathing towards package holidays.  It is written as a guide to backpackers, and is probably useful for finding cheap restaurants and rough hostel accomodation.  It is not as useful as a travel guide. I had travelled to Crete previously on an archeological tour and I know a good deal about the Minoan sites, the Venetian harbours and the Natural amenities such as the Samarian gorge.  I found that the rough guide had litte to say about what was important and much to say about what is not important to the package holidaymaker.

Ender's Game is different because people read it in their droves.<br />This is a wonderful book for readers who are young in years or young in heart, and appeals in the same way as the White Mountains Trilogy or Harry Potter appeals. The issues surrounding bullying and life in a highly competitive school environment are relevant to all school age kids. The way the kids are manipulated by adults right to the end also strikes a chord.<br />But to be a classic a book has to appeal to the adult reader. Despite some thorny issues surrounding the use of children to fight war, this is undoubtedly a book with a wide base of appeal amongst adult readers.  The success of Ender's game is reflected in the number of sequels that have appeared.<br />This is a great book, and a really enjoyable and well told story. What I do believe is that we will see many characters like Demosthenes and Locke blossom on the internet discussion groups, as the net becomes a more coherent medium.  To a certain extent Enders Game might represent a view of our own future!	2000-10-05

I don't read many military thrillers, but I was attracted to this book  because it appeared to be set in the context of an archeological dig in  Sakkara.  How misleading that was! There is no doubt that this is easy  stuff to read, but it is mental chewing-gum.  Even a child would find this  plot implausible.   If you read a Freddy Forsythe novel like the Day of the  Jackal or the Odessa file the material is well researched, but more  importantly the plot is plausible, we believe that this could have  happened.  The story is told so well you cannot but believe.<br />But as for  Meade....A German spy, a plane load of paratroopers and a Jewish prisoner  from a concentration camp on a mission to shoot Roosevelt in Cairo.  What  officer in his right mind would sanction such a mission.  And to be told  that Hitler was relying on this to win the war.  Oh come on!  Give me a  break.<br />What also annoyed me intensely was the American focus of  operations in Cairo.  I am no anglophile, but let's face it Cairo was a  british city in WW2.<br />I won't be reading any more of this unbelievable  tripe.  Oh by the way, Meade is not even a good writer.

What Haldeman does well is come up with an interesting idea and he writes convincingly about military operations, not surprising from a veteran soldier! In Forever War the story was fast paced and punchy, and that made the book a good read. From the first page you are thrown into the plot. <br />But in Forever Peace he builds up to the main plot more slowly. I think he was trying to build better characters by giving us a history of sorts. I think he should stick to the short punchy style. Otherwise he should get a co-writer to work on development of characters, subplots and descriptive sequences. <br />All in all I suppose I like well written books, and as a result I do not like the way Haldeman writes. In this book since he takes half the book to come to the point of his plot, I have to give it a poor rating. For me this book was not a patch on Forever War.  But it is a sequel of sorts, and if you enjoyed Forever War you will probably want to read this one.	2000-09-04

Haldeman tells the tale of a  soldier fighting a lightspeed campaign who finds himself increasingly  isolated from the society he is fighting to protect.  This isolation is  caused by the enormous spans of years that pass on earth relative to his  few months on campaign.  Each battle is a huge gamble since neither side  knows if they are fighting troops from last week or from one hundred years  ago.  Technology changes at breakneck speed and language, customs and  social mores change at the same rate. This is a frightening and thought  provoking image of interstellar war told in a spare and direct style.   There is a heavy focus on the tools of war and the armour suits which save  your life by lobbing off limbs here and there during battle.  A good short  read.	2000-08-25

This is a huge work of marketing research, both in terms of volume and importance.  Although intended as a grounding in the foundations of market  research, the book takes you further than that.

I was particularly impressed with the  section on ethics, which was so clearly laid out that I used it as a guide  when writing a pure ethics paper.<br />The book is amply supplied with  examples and case studies to illustrate the text and make it useful in a  more practical sense.<br />All in all a clear, accessible, well laid out and  well indexed textbook.	2000-08-24

There are many books that are rivals for the award of best beginning, but  this is definitely my vote for the best ever ending of a novel.  Obviously  I can't tell you the end, because that would spoil it, but the end of this  book has kept me thinking for years since I read it. The story itself is  low key, an aging man who has spent his productive years abroad and finds  no solace in returning home.  He decides to head off into the teeth of a  rebellion rather than vegetate in the country of his birth. The novel is  well written, with the nautical detail that you would expect from Raban.  It is a book written at the pace of the central character, a little slow  reflecting his age and the age in which he grew up. Believe me, though,  this is one you want to finish,  The ending is just brilliant.	2000-08-24

When I was small I used to sit on my dad's knee and he would read the book.  Then I would open the flaps on  the pages, and help dad to make the funny smell noises.  Now of course I am  more mature than that, and I read the book for my two year old sister.   There are two people in the book, Ben and Annabelle, and there are lots of  animals making smells.  Some are nice smells, but the best ones are the  nasty smells, pee-youuu!	2000-08-21

If you need this book, it's probably  too late to read it.  In rough weather you are tired, wet, perhaps a little  queasy, getting around the boat is dangerous and difficult.  Bruce lays out  clear and simple strategies for managing yourself and the boat in bad  conditions.  Having experienced up to force 9 myself I can heartily  recommend Bruce as a guide for what to do.  You can sail safely in dreadful  conditions, as long as you know what you are doing.	2000-08-21

I like to settle into a horror a little before it begins to  frighten me out of my skin.  The scariest part of the book is the beginning  and this makes the end seem a little tame in comparison.  All in all though  this is a good book about a composer who writes music that sets off all the  wrong kinds of events.  No surprise that he disappears for many years and  ends up in a remote house in the middle of nowhere...and the phones are  down of course.  Turn off the lights, snuggle up in bed, and read on!	2000-08-21

Lorna Doone is a classic tale of romance and bravery, vengance and  villany.  What is important about the book besides the story is the  societal subtext.  When you read this book you get a picture of what made  the British Empire great.  We see Master Jan, or John Ridd, a simple  squire, who catches his own fish, harvests his own wheat at the head of his  labourers.  This humble man is not afraid to take matters all the way up to  his king and expect justice in return. We see a comedy of errors as militia  groups vie with each other and end up fighting each other instead of the  enemy.  The whole tale is told amid the last battles ever fought on English  soil during the little known Monmouth rebellion. A remarkable and  noteworthy book, which tells more than the main story.  It is both a great  read and a portrait of English rural society of the time.	2000-08-21

A few, a small few warriors, must face a hoarde who threaten to swarm over them.  They stand in a great keep of seven walls.  Each wall has a name and  each name is one state of emotion that we feel when we face death.  So the  defence of the walls, and each wall lost, brings death closer. Central to  the story is Druss the Legend, the axe wielding warrior who moulds the  defence into a coherent fighting unit and gives them the backbone to stand  in the face of certain defeat. This is powerful stuff, and it is a crafted  novel that has been well thought out.  Very thin on magic and strong on  character, a book about human spirit.  This book is a classic.	2000-08-18

Edgeworth wrote about the protestant upper class in Ireland around the  turn of the 18th/19th century.  At the time, especially in Rackrent, her  most famous work, she wrote of the machinations of bad landlords and how  their families died out.  It is interesting that she was writing about the  demise of these bad landlords, suggesting that things had improved in this  more enlightened age, at a time when the Irish Peasant was worse off than  ever.  Edgeworth wrote of a society that was on the brink of extinction,  but she was not aware of this, since she was part of that society. This  book is noteworthy for what it is not.  It is not Irish literature.  It is  poor british literature and would have no merit at all if it did not serve  to contrast with the high quality scribblings of the uneducated and  unwashed downtrodden masses. Like the protestant ruling class it is sparse,  stilted and haughty.  Not a fun read.	2000-08-18

This is the tale of a boy growing up in Dalkey in the 1940's and 50's.  It is autobiographical and gives an intimate view of Leonard and the  influences that effected him in his youth.  The book is a collection of  cameos of life in a small Irish village just south of Dublin.  Dalkey is  now part of the greater Dublin Sprawl, but this book captures a time when  it was only a village.  Leonard regales us with hilarious tales, the dog  who attacks priests and policemen, his job interview in a pub where he  learns the one great truth in life ( in a pub toilet incoming traffic has  right of way). If you know Leonard through his plays (Da and a Life  especially) you will have seen some of this material.  Even so, the  impeccable writing and a real feel for prose makes this book worth a read.	2000-08-18

Hence I came to  this book knowing nothing of the place and with no emotional involvement at  all.  Mitchener manages to make the place important through a combination  of history and characterisation.  He uses the sagas of a number of families  to personalise the bay and give it meaning and dimension.  By the end of  the book I found myself empathising with the wildlife, bemoaning the  shorefront development and wishing I could do something to reverse the  destruction of the pristine landscape that we saw at the beginning of the  book.  Totally engaging and a great read.  Well worth the five stars.	2000-08-18

I read Cheseapake before I read this and I was enthralled at the way  history was woven into a coherent saga that followed a few key families  through time.<br />But in Covenant Mitchener fails to maintain the coherence.   At times the story breaks down completely and becomes a pure history book,  or subjective narrative.  He captures all the complexity of the situation  in South Africa in the apartheid era, and if you know nothing of the  political history it is a useful read, but in the end it is not a great  novel.	2000-08-18

His idea is good, the plot is good, the narrative is well constructed with  a very interesting way of telling Felix's story through his suit hookup.   But there are two key problems with the novel.  The first is the weak  characterisation of all the main actors, Felix, Crow, Holly and the  incredibly cardboard women.  Women will really hate this book with a  vengance.<br />The other problem is more serious.  This is a writer who cannot  write.  His syntax is all over the place, dialogue jumps meaninglessly  about, and at times the narrative seems to be giving one story and then  reverses events without warning.  If the writer can't write, OK, fair  enough, but what was the editor doing?  Both of you do yourselves a favour  and edit the material before you print it.<br />Finally, all the killing of a  mindless and relentless enemy is monotonous.  It is a rip off of starship  troopers, and a bad rip off at that.  The enemy must have some motive, some  raison d'etre.  Why would an armed technologically capable enemy attack  with bare mandibles?  Perhaps there is a logical reason, but if so you must  tell the reader.  This book fails to be credible, even for Sci-fi.	2000-08-18

This is a wonderful play in which Leonard explores his relationship with  his Da (a Dublin boys name for his father, pronounced with an &quot;a&quot;  as in &quot;at&quot; and not as in &quot;all&quot;)  It was made into a  film starring Martin Sheen, and that is best avoided.  The character of  Leonard as a boy with his father, and as an older man, returned for his  father's funeral are played on stage by the same actor, who switches  cleverly between the two roles.  At one moment he is a wide eyed child who  hangs on every word of his father, believing without question and revering  his Da.  Then he is the cynical and jaded older man, who cannot fathom the  limitations and stupidity of both his younger self and his father.  In the  end however, we see a picture of a man who needs to reconcile himself with  his father and does so through this play in a way that is passionate and  personal.	2000-08-18

They are a species with high intelligence and a  rich quality of life, they have opposable thumbs and can climb better than  a chimpanzee.  Imagine an animal with the intelligence of a chimp and the  hearing and smell of a dog, armed with the teeth of a wolf and claws with  opposable thumbs.  Imagine that animal stalking you in the dark alleys at  four in the morning as you stumble home drunk from a party, and imagine  that he already knows that you live alone and that no one will miss you if  you disappear off the face of the earth.

I especially enjoyed  the sex scene, talk about trusting someone!  The feudal nature of the  planetary half of the story was very appealing and the book is worth a read  for this part of the story alone.<br />I suppose the difficulty is in melding  the two halves of the book together.

Gerald Durrell was the first to claim that he was not a writer, he gave  that honour up to his brother Lawerence.  Gerald wrote first and foremost  to pay for the Zoo in Jersey that was his life.  Many of his books are  hilarious accounts of his exploits in collecting the animals for his zoo.  When he added an account of his youth in Corfu the book &quot;My family and  other animals&quot; became a huge success, much to his surprise.  It was  some time before he wrote the absolutely hilarous &quot;Rosie is my  relative&quot; which was his first work of true fiction.  In this book I  believe he reaches the pinnacle of his ability.  Not as bellyachingly funny  as &quot;Rosie&quot; this book is more poignant and very beautifully  written.  It is more poignant since it describes the rediscovery of the  Mockery Bird which is a metaphor for the Dodo, that most famous of extinct  species.  Durrell fought all his life to save species from extinction and  so I think that there is a special hope in his heart that emerges in this  book.  A hope for the future of animals.	2000-08-04

The other half of this book is the historical perspective  on california when San Francisco was a station and when all of the West was  Spanish.  It is a unique account of California before the arrival of the  railroad.  It is pure serendipity that a man of Dana's education served as  an ordinary seaman and was able to pen this unique account of life at sea.

I'm no architect and this is a book I borrowed from the bookshelf of my  brother who is an architect.  How many technical books is a layman going to  bother to pick up.  This gives a great feel for the possibilities of earth  sheltered design under differing climatic conditions.  If you are  interested in the concept you could do worse than to start with this book.  I am attracted to earth sheltered design for it's energy efficiency and  it's low impact on the landscape, but as a design perspective you have to  rate it before you can reject it.  I just hate all the energy wasted on  heating and cooling when we can use nature to do most of that for us  without killing the planet in the process.	2000-08-04

It told the tales of the Celtic knights and  their brave battles with human foe and with non- humans as well.  This book  is the tale of the Tain told from an interesting point of view, a potential  mate of Maeve of Connaught who cannot be corn king because he crashes his  sportscar (or the local version anyway - his chariot).  It is a good  rendition of the story and well worth a read.  If you don't think you like  ancient irish mythology, then forget all the above - all you need to know  is that it's a brilliant and exciting story.  You will want to read the  sequel afterwards -the crow goddess.	2000-08-04

Joseph O'Connor is the brother of Sinead O'Connor the Irish singer / songwriter (Lion and Cobra), but is an artist in his own right.  His  fiction is wild and hilarious and well worth a read.  Before he went into  fiction he was a newspaper columnist in London and Dublin and this is a  collection of interviews and articles edited into book form.  As a result  they cover a lot of ground and a lot of issues, with some being a little  out of date at this stage.  However it makes a good book for picking up and  reading a couple of pages and putting down again - what some people refer  to as toilet reading.  The highlight is coverage he did when the Irish  played in the Soccer World Cup in USA when he follows a group of inebriated  fans through the Disney experience in Florida.  Cross cultural limits are  exposed as he explores the difference in meaning of the words ride and  mickey between Ireland and the USA.  Another memorable tale is the Irish  beggar in London who is pretending to be a Bosnian -everyone needs an edge  these days!	2000-08-04

It is an evocative and enchanting work rich in history and politics, religion  and culture.  There are plots, sub plots and Dickenesque twists of  parentage.  The liberal artistic and beautiful Arbonne threatended by the  dour and dark forces of Gorhaut.  The medieval lifestyle is elegantly  portrayed and the one thing that did not ring true in the entire book was  the king of Gorhaut engaging in sexual exploits with the wife of a Coran in  front of his nobles.  A strict and fundamentalist society does not tolerate  such behaviour even in it's kings.  It may be harsh treatment but this  single slip loses GG kay my fifth star.

In the  process we see the difficulties faced by Victorian explorers and you can  only marvel at the bravery of the men to undertake such journeys.<br />We see  the recriminations that erupt in London when Speke claims (rightly but  without real proof) that Victoria is the source and how Burton is sidelined  and eventually is lucky to find positions in the worst jobs in the foreign  service.  A sad end for one of the worlds greatest explorers.  I can feel  no sympathy for the end that Speke met with, but read it for yourself.

The Gasmakers uses the records of the towns gas companies of Ireland to  chart the history of the Gas industry in Ireland from the latter half of  the 18th Century to the Present.  It charts the earlies experiments in gas  production from coal through the set up of the towns gas companies and the  first streetlighting.  It explores the dead ends such as gas production  from fish oils.  It highlights the rivalry between Gas and Electricity at  the end of the 19th century when gas won out by the introduction of the  incandescent mantle, and then the gradual loss of share to electricity as  the latter technology began to surpass gas in luminosity.  The management  of the towns gas companies is explored, the manufacture of gas from coal  and later from naphta.  The sub-industries such as tar production.  It  examines through archive material the development of gas production  technology and the final evolution of the industry in Ireland to Natural  gas after the discovery of reserves off Kinsale.  The last chapter was the  centralisation of the towns gas companies into Bord Gais the current Irish  Gas Company.  The book contains many valuable archive photographs, the  records of the old lamplighters and their place in society reflected  through song and poem.  For those interested in the industry it is a valued  and cherished work, a model for all such archive collections.	2000-08-04

Forget bad guy good guy stuff  - all the patients in the cancer ward face death and their pasts are  irrelevant.  As the poem says -scepter and crown are equal made with poor  and crooked scythe and spade (Death the Leveller).  What distinguishes this  book is the ending where Kostoglotof walks out of hospital to view the  world with hope and to live each day for what it is, as each of us should  live every day of our lives.  We all die - cancer or not - and what is  important is not that we live but how we live.

It is not tourist guide which  says stay here, eat this menu, see this statue.  All that is left to the  standard tourist guide writers.  If you never travel to a country, you can  know it through the insight guide.  Because Muslim and Turkish cultures are  so different from ours (and Turkish is different to Arabic Muslim) it is  important to be aware of the behaviours that are considered polite and  those that are considered to be rude.  This book equips you to deal  courteously with salesmen who would be considered pushy by western  standards.  Did you know for instance that it is rude to kiss your partner  in the street in Turkey (or any muslim country) even if it is only a peck  on the cheek -whereas it is polite for men to kiss each other in public.   Why were Turks feared by all of Europe for seven hundred years?  Why do the  Greeks still hate them with such passion (if you want to insult a Greek  just call him a Turk and see the reaction).  For depth of analysis on  culture, history and geography, to understand what makes the people tick,  you should read this book.  Then if you travel to Turkey you may, like me,  find the Turks to be the friendliest people you have ever met.  You may  also understand why such friendly people are capable of being represented  in quite a different way in Movies like Midnight Express.  Vive la  difference!	2000-08-02

Farewell Companions is overly nostalgic and is more  like a loose and undefined family history than a novel.  The writing is not  tight and is really quite rambling at times.

A french classic from Albert Camus about a French Man who knifes an arab on a beach after the death of his mother.

It is a  terse and compelling piece of literature narrated from the point of view of  the central character.  He bears no feeling, no remorse for what he has  done.  Does he elicit our sympathy?  Do we feel for him who feels nothing  for us?  Are we hypocritical as a society or do we condemn those around us  for who they are rather than what they do?  The answers to these and other  questions are posed within the pages, but you will find no answers here.  This is a book to make you think, not to answer your questions!  It is  simple, short and brilliant.

Most management texts try to deal with how you as an individual can influence how other people behave so that you come out on top.  This book goes under the skin of different personality types to show what it is that  motivates them in the way they behave.

Instead of results driven  management being the be-all and end-all it is clear that results are only  one side of the equation.  To be a good manager you need to bring people  along with you, not drive them in front of you.  This book forms the text  for a management training course that can only be said to be revolutionary.

This is the story of a voyage across the north atlantic to retrace the great voyages of the Viking era.  Sailing in a Bristol cutter the brave crew undertake to go north instead of the traditional southerly route  favoured by us in already high latitudes.  Dressed for cold in their best  salvaged clothing this book captures the real flavour of the long night  watches (complete with nonsense poetry) the heart stopping excitement of  rough weather sailing and all the real adventure that is open to anyone who  can cadge a boat and a few charts.  We come to know the cutter very well as  a boat, and in Norway there is an opportunity to compare it in the water  against the Femboring, a modern day descendant of the traditional Viking  ship.  There are interesting tales of the attitudes of Customs officers to  bonded whisky  and of the differences between drinkers and Christians in  Norway.  The book is enticing in its description of sailing in northern  latitudes and may even convince me to consider a jaunt up towards the  Faroes myself.  More than just a sailing book this is a good reading book  and a great way of working in a little Viking history to a light read.	2000-07-24

For the serious reader of history this is undoubtedly a useful reference work, but I read the book as someone who dabbles a toe in the  military history of different ages.  I found this to be an accessible and  informative work.  It is a history, not a novel, and as a history it  delivers a good meaty narrative backed up with in-depth analysis of events.   Although it is called a concise history the book is by no means a concise  work.  It spans a period of hundreds of years of history and examines  crusades that I never knew were crusades and some I never knew existed.  I  hadn't realised that the war in Spain between Christian and Moorish kings  had achieved official papal crusade standard, and I was unaware of the  crusades that were fought along the German borders throughout the period.   I recommend this book to anyone who has a thirst for information on this  period, drink deep from this well and be satisfied.  This is one of those  rare books that crosses the line between textbook and non-fiction.	2000-07-24

At first glance this seems like a very expensive book for such a short read.  However, a quick perusal of the contents quickly reveals that the book is written in a tight style with absolutely no padding whatsoever.  On  the one hand this is great, because every sentence you read yields value  and there is no waste.  On the other hand it means that you must read this  book carefully or you can easily miss key concepts.   The book gives a  strong history and review of strategic thinking up to publication, and is a  fantastic reference work when researching issues back to the original  authors.  Well researched and intelligently written.  It explores strategic  theory under the headings of innovation, learning, structuring, leadership  and culture and finally transformation and renewal.  This is a companion  book for a case based approach to the study of strategic management.  As  such it is a valuable friend to have beside you.	2000-07-21

I used Lovelock's &quot;Services Marketing&quot; as a text and this book as a backup for my services marketing module in a Masters of Business Studies Course.  It would be easily as useful at undergraduate level.  The  book is a compilation of good industry articles by well respected authors  including David Maister, Berry, Zeithaml and Parasuraman, Sandra  Vandermerwe and Peter Drucker to name but a few.  The articles are arranged  by topic into eight sections as follows:  Challenge of Services,  Understanding Services, Design and Delivery, Managing capacity and demand,  Search for Quality, Adding value through customer service, the human  dimension in services management, Strategy and Integration.  Each section  has three or more articles followed by a couple of relevant case studies  where you can track the issues in real environments. All in all a very  useful text and a valuable reference work on my office bookshelf.	2000-07-21

This is a collection of good essays from Irish Marketing practicioners and lecturers.  It is a useful tool for a course on Advertising or for gaining a familiarity with the Irish advertising and promotions markets.  The  contents are laid out in detail in a very clear way. So why 3 stars?  Well,  primarilly because there is no index of subjects.  If you want to find  something you read about you have to troll through the contents pages or  rely on your memory.  I found that this made it very difficult to use when  writing papers and where I needed references.  It forces you to take  copious hand written notes as you read.  Quite frankly this is a pain! Many  of the articles are specifically related to Irish circumstances, which is  good if you need local knowledge.  Cultural specifics are so important in  advertising that I would wholeheartedly advise anyone attempting to make  moves into retailing in Ireland to read this book from cover to cover.   Repeated failures of British Supermarket chains to enter the Irish market  demonstrate that we are different in many ways from even our closest  neighbour, and failure to take account of this can lead to disaster.	2000-07-21

Hough has done the impossible.  He has taken what is generally a dry and unappetising subject and turned it into a feast for the senses.  How many times has anyone said they picked up a management textbook and couldn't put  it down?  This is such a book.  The subject is addressed through a  narrative text where our hero, a recently graduated engineer driving a  wreck of a car, is thrown in at the deep end in a factory that comes  straight out of Heronomous Bosch.  His road to salvation is paved by a  secretive advisor who meets him in dark rooms and restaurants and tells him  where to seek the holy grail of TQM.  The book has a happy ending, but more  importantly, by the end of the book you have assimilated the concepts of  TQM and can talk sensibly about the subject with those pointy headed ones  who seek to baffle you with science. This book is a must for any manager in  a manufacturing environment and maybe for a few of us in service companies  as well. It makes a good read too, even if you can't care less about  quality.	2000-07-21

Given the export led focus of the Irish economy and the success of the economy in the last ten years there is  probably no-one better positioned than Bradley to identify the factors  salient to the success or failure of international marketing stragegies in  the real world.  Ideally this book should be used in conjunction with case  study material to illustrate the issues.  Taken on it's own it may appear  to be a little weighty and it could be perceived as a daunting read.   However, it remains for me a valuable reference work	2000-07-21
US	49621826	R2MLS4GGNDG75N	0446404365	402682088	Underdog	Books	4	1	1	N	N	The invisible society around us.	I came to this book with no expectations and it turned out to be a wonderful gem.  It is a different book, the language and the writing style are lean and pacy, just like the central character Jan Moro.  You can't  call him a hero.  He reminds me of a healthier version of Ratzo Rizzo from  the Movie Midnight Cowboy, as played by Dustin Hoffman.  He is to all  intents and purposes a little weasel, a man who exists upon the fringes of  society.  He is an idealist, a dreamer and represents the underculture of  the homeless society around us.  <br />There is a pathetic sub-theme to this  character, that of someone with no resources, not even a home.  He has no  friends, only underworld aquaintences who are entirely untrustworthy.  Moro  has no access into our world and this struck me with a cold and frightening  realization of the impotence of people like him.<br />However, this is not a  book trying to make us examine our conciences.  It is a fast and very funny  read.  There is something of the style of the gangster novel about it, the  sparse and punchy wit (a car pulled up with a jerk.  The jerk got out).   Hard to get your hands on this book now, but well worth a read.  Not great  literature and it will never win a nobel prize, but then what would Jan  Moro do with a nobel prize?  Pawn it probably, for his next grand scheme.	2000-07-20

A lonely hero dedicated to lifting the performance from all her staff. The evil scion of a royal family who sets her up for a fall. The political plots, the high level manoevering of top brass, the dark shadow of the Havenite empire looming on the horizon, and Honor Harrington fixing it all with all guns blazing and a little kick boxing thrown in.     It is a good old fashioned Treasure Island type book set in space. OK so Weber writes as a man and doesn't give us a very feminine feel to Honor. She is merely a man dressed up as a woman to give the swashbuckling a bit of flavour. Also the technospeak, while it sounds good is really a lot of garbage. This is not hard sci-fi, but it often sounds as though it could be. Impeller drives and Warshawski sails sound as though they could be based on some physical theory.    This is my second Harrington novel, and I am not disappointed. I look forward to a longer association with this heroine of the heavens. Roll out the grazers, deploy the LAC's, launch the missiles and close for the broadside, Manticore expects every hardened space tar and every grizzled space marine to do their duty!	2000-07-17

Wilcox set out to demonstrate that certain selected warriour classes were the key to the successes of certain key events in human history.  What he demonstrates to me is that it is an adjustment in technology, or in the use  of technology, which is key to these examples.  The great warrior classes  discussed are in the end, almost circumstancial to the events. For the  Vikings it was their ships which made the difference, for the archers it  was the longbow, for the skirmishers it was the Kentucky Rifle. The Zulus  used the short stabbing spear and military tactics designed by Shaka, and  won due to the failures of the British rather than through their own skill.   Rourke's Drift proved that the Zulu Warrior could not stand up to  sustained fire by well trained troops making proper use of the  Martini-Henry rifle. The final two chapters highlight the fact that the new  technologies represented by U-boats and Tanks revolutionised warfare.  They  also show that the technologies must be used and practiced, and tactics  must be developed to suit the technology rather than the other way around.  All in all Wilcox demonstrates a distinct lack of ability in analyzing the  data he presents.  I would contend that any group of individuals could have  been trained with these weapons and would have performed as well, with the  exception perhaps of the Vikings, who were physically larger than their  celtic foes.<br />Technology has always been the key to changing the patterns  of human development.  When technology was stable life stagnated, as in the  middle ages.  It is invention that makes the difference be it fire, the  wheel, the stirrup, steam engines or semi-conductors. I regret to say that  this is a book which singularly fails to prove its point.  At best it is a  light holiday read or it may help flesh out your knowledge of certain  historical events.	2000-06-29
