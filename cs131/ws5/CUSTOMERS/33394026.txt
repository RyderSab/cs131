Together with 13 other contributors he has produced this interesting book on family health for social work practitioners.   This book is divided into two sections (Practive interventions; policy, programs and emerging families) with a total of 13 chapters on children and families. The introduction chapter explains the concept of family health followed by six chapters on intervention approach to different populations at risk (child sexual abuse, divorce, HIV/AIDS, disability, loss, migrant and seasonal farmworking families). The second section has six chapters on grandparents as parents, lesbian and gay  families, child welfare, homeless women, neighborhood and community practice.   Family health social work practice is involved with the holistic well-being of the family system and its members and this has been the philosophy behind the contributors to this work. We found several chapters of interest, but especially the chapter on \\"Services for families with children with disabilities\\" by Ute C Orgassa, a social worker trained both in Germany and the United States.

It is true that \\"fathering\\" has become a hot issue in human development research, but in fact we are talking about a recovery of awareness and not something unprecedented as discussed in the book by Eli Newberger (The men they will become. The nature and nurture of male character. Cambridge, MA: Perseus Publ, 1999). Here it is documented that English and American fathers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were active in all aspects of domestic life, from monitoring their wives' pregnancies to taking responsibility for the daily socialization of their children, but in the nineteenth century fathers were somehow displaced from the center of the family circle and only recognized through the expression of a paycheck.  <br /> This book is based on more than 20 studies performed by the author in the United Kingdom using five different data sources spanning a time period of more than 40 years with an international review of studies in the field of the role of the father in child development.  <br /> This is a scholarly book with important research that will serve as a reference in this field. Her studies showed that father involvement was sometimes associated with \\"good\\" children's (career maturity in adolescence, labour force participation, state benefits receipt and subsidised housing in adult life) outcome and sometimes unrelated. Father involvement was associated with low risk for delinquincy in sons (but not in daughters), father interest in child education was related to daughter's (but not son's) educational attainment in adult life and father involvement protected against experience of homelessness in adult sons (but not in daughets) from low (but not high) socio-economic groups. <br /> <br />Gideon Vardi, MD, MPH <br />Zusman Child Development Center, Division of Pediatrics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben Gurion University of the Negev in Beer-Sheva, Israel.

Early trauma of both physical and emotional kind have effects on the developing brain, which is the subject of this book with a review of current up to date knowledge in this field. Phyllis T Stien is a psychiatric nurse working as a mental health consultant for Head Start and Early Childhood Education programs and Joshua C Kendall is a freelance health care writer with experience in child health and human development. <br /> This book has seven chapters: brain growth, birth to five, PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder), complex PTSD in children, healing the brain, Billy's story and translating scientific advances into policy with several illustrative case-stories and an extensive bibliography.  <br /> Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) was formally recognized in 1980 in DSM-III (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders), but as a disorder it is an old problem described by physicians dealing with soldiers having \\"shell shock\\" seen in the first World War. In the late 1970s researchers found that survivors of rape and battered women suffered the same symptoms, but only lately has it been accepted that abused and maltreated children also suffer from PTSD with symptoms of reexperiencing the traumatic event, persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the event and a persistent state of heightened arousal. It can either by a single overwhelming event or after repeated traumas (like abuse and maltreatment over time). <br /> In this book you will find the current explanations about the effects of trauma on the developing brain, interventions and case stories to illustrate, but also information describing the lack of  societal involvement in spite of the enormous costs of child maltreatment to society. This book is recommended to professionals working with children in general, but also professionals in the fields of pediatrics, child psychiatry and psychology. <br /> <br />Gideon Vardi, MD, MPH <br />Zusman Child Development Center, Division of Pediatrics, Soroka University Medical Center, Ben Gurion University, Beer-Sheva, Israel.

This situation has today resulted in people with ID all of a sudden entering the third age or golden age, but the service provider and service systems in many countries have been taken by surprise and adaptation and support systems will need to be established in order to care better for this population. <br /> This book is therefore most welcome with an extensive review of the research and service development in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia with illustrative vignettes and relevant questions following the first four parts of the book.

If the child will manage to succeed in school the economic future, social and emotional status, career and quality of life will be positively affected. The issue at hand in this book is what sometimes is referred to as learning disability (LD) or disorder. LD is a disorder that affect the ability to either interpret what is seen and heard or to link information from different parts of the brain. These limitations can show up as specific difficulties with spoken and written language, coordination, self control or attention. Such difficulties extend to schoolwork and can impede learning to read, write or do math. But LD must be seen in a broader picture of developmental disability that also include attention deficit disorder, attention deficit hyperactive disorder, pervasive developmental disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Asperger's syndrome and autism. We are talking about many children involved and therefore the importance of this book. <br /> This book has 11 chapters with topics like the evolution of the brain and why the brain works the way it does, sign and symptoms of neurobehavioral disorders, therapeutic theory and strategies. This book is well researched with many references with a focus on alternations of the normal child development in relation to the learning disorders described above. A working theory is presented based on what is known of the neurological and cognitive development in the context of evolution of the human species and its brain.  <br /> This book will be of interest for neurologists, professionals involved in child development and the human brain.It is another step forward in the work to find solutions to learning disability. <br /> <br />Professor Joav Merrick, MD <br />Director, National Institute of Child Health and Human Developmentand Medical director, Division for Mental Retardation, Box 1260, IL-91012 Jerusalem, Israel.

Rather, it is a compendium of all, or nearly all, the best-known marketing activities, techniques and consulting models.  It could be used as a textbook for a college introductory course, as a do-it-yourself primer on marketing \\"from ground zero\\" or as a review and checklist for a consultant undertaking a strategic marketing engagement.  It is equally adept for all those purposes. <br />The strength of the book is its breadth and completeness. Unfortunately, this means it loses any higher-level perspectives. Consider, for comparison's sake, the Brand Gap: How to Bridge the Distance Between Business Strategy and Design by Marty Neumeier.  That book is the polar opposite - it has little detail, just very-high level perspectives to raise readers' understanding of branding strategies. The other book's key value is its insightful theories and observations. But to understand these insights and theories, the reader must be well versed in basic marketing techniques. <br />The choice is the reader's. For the beginner, for the student, or for someone needing a \\"check for completeness\\", such as a marketing consultant or marketing manager, Marketing Your Business is the ideal tome for your in-the-office library.

The National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 (P.L.103-43) formally established the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) within the Office of the Director, NIH, to facilitate study and evaluation of complementary and alternative medical practices and to disseminate the resulting information to the public. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM)( [...]) was established by Congress under Title VI, Section 601 of the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 1999 (P.L. 105-277). This bill amended Title IV of the Public Health Service Act and elevated the status of the OAM to an NIH Center.  <br /> Complementary and alternative medicine can be classified into five domains: alternative medical systems (Chinese medicine, Ayurveda, Tibetan medicine, homeopathy, naturopathy), mind-body interventions (yoga, meditation, biofeedback, art and music therapy, Tai Chi Chuan), biologically based interventions (aromatherapy, herbs, diet-vitamins and minerals-nutraceuticals, magnetic-electricl-electromagnetic interventions), body-based manipulation therapies (bodywork-massage, chiropractic, osteopathy) and energy-metaphysical therapies (therapeutic touch-Reiki, prayer, Shamanism and spirit in medicine). <br /> This book by Robert A Roush, PhD in complementary and alternatice health from Westbrook University in Aztec, New Mexico and director of the 7 Senses Health Center in Bethlehem in Pennsylvania is into five chapters: review of CAM, research, choosing modalities for a clinic, clinic design and structure, needed research, suggestions and speculations. <br /> We found this book a good review of CAM with sound practical advice on how to set up a clinic and the research issues involved.  <br /> <br />Professor Joav Merrick, MD <br />Director, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and Medical director, Division for Mental Retardation, Box 1260, IL-91012 Jerusalem, Israel.

We should also be proud that such a relevant book has been edited by two Israeli experts. <br /> This is a very comprehensive book on the psycho-social aspect of pediatric oncology relevant for all professionals working with this population. Every department treating pediatric oncology patients should have it on the shelf.  <br /> <br />Professor Joav Merrick, MD <br />Director, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and Medical director, Division for Mental Retardation, Box 1260, IL-91012 Jerusalem, Israel.

Today he is professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine with several important textbooks and many hundreds of published scientific articles. <br /> This is a first edition on the developmental science and evidence based clinical practice for children and youth with mental health problems with a focus on intervention. This book has 36 chapters with 54 mainly American contributors divided into four parts: developmental science, psychopharmacology, psyvhotherapy and sociotherapy. <br />  Each chapter in itself is an enjoyment, but it was nice to find a whole chapter on research methodology in clinical trials by Kirti Saxena and Christine Blasey, both from Stanford University. <br /> This handbook and in fact tewxtbook is warmly recommended for students in psychopathology from the field of both child and adolescent psychiatry and psychology.   <br /> <br />Professor Joav Merrick, MD <br />Director, National Institute of Child Health and Human development and Medical director, Division for Mental Retardation, Box 1260, IL-91012 Jerusalem, Israel.

Morbidity in childhood and adolescence has changed and the new disease pattern is dominated by obesity, diabetes, teen pregnancy, substance abuse, school violence and child abuse. The editors have chosen to use the primary prevention model developed by Gordon (Gordon R. An operational classification of disease prevention. Public Health Reports 1983;98:107-9), where the focus is on interventions to prevent the onset of a disorder or problem. Such intervention is divided into three areas: universal (interventions targeted to the general population), selective (interventions targeted to individual or groups at high risk for a specific disorder) or indicated (targeted for individuals with detectable signs or symptoms of a specific disorder). This theory is the basic concept for the presentation of the different chapters in this handbook on subjects like teenage suicide, substance abuse, teenage prognancy, AIDS, eating disorders, school violence and dropout. <br /> We found this book based on sound research with a focus on evidence based approach to prevention, which can provide practitioners, policy-makers and professionals with sound material on emotional, health and social problems facing children and youth today. <br /> <br />Professor Joav Merrick, MD <br />Director, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Medical director, Division for Mental Retardation, Box 1260, IL-91012 Jerusalem, Israel.

He first examined Auguste D, a 51-year old female patient, at Frankfurt hospital in 1901 and continued to follow her case after he left for the Royal Psychiatric Clinic in Munich, up until her death on April 8th, 1906. Even after her death he went on to study the neuropathological features of her illness. Shortly after her death he presented her case at the 37th Conference of German Psychiatrist in Tubingen on Nevember 4th, 1906 in which he described her symptoms as progressive cognitive impairment, focal symptoms, hallucinations, delusions, psychosocial incompetence with the following neurobiological changes found at autopsy: plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and artheriosclerotic changes. Alzheimer's disease (AD) effects about 2-3% of persons at age 65 years with a doubling of incidence for every five years of age afterwards.<BR>AD is the most common cause of dementia in western countries. Approximately 10 percent of all persons over 70 years have significant memory loss and more than half is the result of AD, which translates to about 3-4 million persons in the United States. This results in a total health care cost of more than 50 billion dollars per year in the United States and the estimated annual cost of caring for a single AD patient in an advanced stage of the disease is USDollars 47,000. Clinicaly AD most often presents with a subtle onset of memory loss followed bya slowly progressive dementia that has a course of several years. Adults with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome, DS) develop the typical neuropathological hallmarks of AD if they survive beyond 40 years. Many also develop a progressive dementia superimposed on the baseline intellectual disability.<BR>This handbook with 22 contributors gives you a broad interdiscplinary approach to the diagnosis, treatment and comorbidities of dementia, which we would like to recommend to professionals working with this disability population.<br />Professor Joav Merrick, MD<BR>Director, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and Medical director, Division for Mental Retardation, Box 1260, IL-91012 Jerusalem, Israel.

The case for contraception and abortion in wo	Daniel C Maguire is professor of Moral Theological Ethics at Marquette University, a Catholic, Jesuit Institution, president of the Religious Consultation on Population, Reproductive Health and Ethics in Milwaukee, WI with a degree in Sacred Theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome.  <BR> With a continuation of the growth of the global population, contraception or family planning and abortion becomes very critical and moral issues that face today's family, no matter where they are living or from what religion they stem. Sometimes the views of professionals, international organizations or agencies will eventually clash with the view of clergy and religious belief.<BR> This book has 12 chapters: a Jewish perspective, Roman Catholicism, Protestant Christianity, Islam, Hindu view, Thai Buddhism, practices in Nigeria, American Indian traditions, Chinese considerations during the late Imperial period, Taoist approaches, Jainism with a concluding chapter on reproduction and sexuality in a changing world. <BR> There are about 80 million pregnancies globally each year with about one third unwanted or mistimed. Fifty million end up in abortion with 20 million performed under unsafe conditions and 78,000 women die each year. Not to mention the hundred of thousands with short or long-term disabilities as a result. These fact makes this book very important and efforts by governments and United Nations to decriminalize and make abortions safer should be looked upon positively. <BR> Many of the world religions have a say upon the issue of family planning, but the attitudes and rulings have fluctuated over time. The authors of this book from various part of the world and different religions present alternative interpretations of their various religion's view upon family planning and show a more wide and more open stand than the usual conservative held views that we generally hear.<BR> We found this book important in the continuing debate on abortion and family planning from the viewpoint of religion.	2004-01-10

In this second and revised edition she gives a comprehensive review of  social work in different health care settings.<BR> Social work in health care started in the United States in 1905, when the physician Richard C Cabot at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Internal Medicine Clinic asked the nurse Garnet I Pelton to fill up the position of hospital social worker. Two years later social work was also introduced at the Neurology Clinic at the same hospital and this way the field developed in order \\"to guide the patient to solve their social problems, either as a result of illness or to which illness may have been due in part\\". In 1913 there were social workers in 10 hospitals, in 1923 in 400 and today about 125,000 social workers are working in health care settings in the United States with social work services in 76% of psychiatric hospitals and 86% of general acute care hospitals.<BR> The introduction in section I has two chapters on orientation to social work in the health field and fundamentals of health care social work practice. Settings at the three levels of intervention in section II has five chapters on primary care settings, hospitals, home care, nursing homes and hospice care, while health care delivery and financing in section III has two chapters on US health care system strengths and problems and a vision of future social work practice in health care.  <BR> This book is concerned with the United States and very much with adult and elderly care, which is the brunt of the work for the social worker in the health care field, but we would have like to see in a future edition entries on children, the important role of the health care social worker in the area of child abuse and maltreatment, family violence, disability both in children and adults with discussion of care in the hospital, the residential care and the home care aspects. In the index you will not find any mention of children, child abuse, disability, developmental disability, intellectual disability or mental retardation, which we feel should be issues discussed in a book on the role of the social worker in the health field. On the other hand this book gives you the basics, fundamentals and work methods as an introduction to the social worker's task in the health care settings.<BR> <BR>Professor Joav Merrick, MD<br />Director, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and Medical director, Division for Mental Retardation, Box 1260, IL-91012 Jerusalem, Israel.

He has been very active over the last 30 years as an academic, as a researcher, as a politician, as a reformer and as a program developer on the issue of drug addition and its treatment and management.<BR> This book has six chapters: introduction to the study, etiology of HIV transmission, heroin and commercial sex work, study methods, comparing Mexican and San Bernardino sex workers, summary with an appendix where you can find the survey questionnaire and an excellent index.  <BR> The book is the result of  two research projects. One interview study in San Bernadino with 72 female sex workers (FSW) in 1988 and in Mexico (Tijuana, Ciudad Juarez, Ciudad Victoria, Cuernavaca) during 1996-1999 with 102 FSW. In both studies the interview was on site, where the FSW worked and the interview included 48 questions on demographics, types of sexual behavior, types of clients and number served per day, history of STD and HIV infection, condom use and client attitudes towards condoms, alcohol and other drug dependence, criminal history, knowledge and attitudes towards AIDS.<BR> This study showed marked differences between Mexican and American FSW with a much better situation for FSW in Mexico. The women in Mexico have more monthly medical checkups, have been tested monthly for STD as a legal requirement, have been tested for HIV, have sex with fewer clients and mainly with own race or ethnic group, reported that most customers used condoms and wanted that protection, have condoms in their possession, have dependent children and very little intravenous drug abuse. From the study the author recommend for Mexico to reduce or eliminate prostitute health license fees in order to maximize health surveillence, to educate in schools about STD and AIDS and legalize prostitution in controlled settings. For the United States he recommends better HIV/AIDS/STD prevention and treatment programs, free methadone maintenance for heroin addicts, free needle and syringe exchange programs, decriminalize heroin and reform prostitution laws and legalize prostitution.<BR> This is indeed a very interesting book with a healthy and concerned approach to the \\"oldest trade\\" in town, which policy makers and administrators should take seriously.   <BR> <BR>Professor Joav Merrick, MD<BR>Director, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and Medical director, Division for Mental Retardation, Box 1260, IL-91012 Jerusalem, Israel, email: jmerrick@internet-zahav.net<br />Mohammed Morad, MD<BR>Family physician, Division for Community Health, Ben Gurion University, Box 653, IL-84105 Beer-Sheva, Israel, email: morad-62@barak-online.net	2004-01-05

Ronit Aloni is a sex therapist affiliated with the Loewenstein Rehabilitation Hospital in Raanana, Israel, with a background in studies on human sexuality at New York University and Shlomo Katz, is professor of rehabilitation psychology at Bar Ilan University in Ramat Gan, Israel. Ronit Alonis doctoral thesis on Designing an early sexual intervention program for the first stage of the rehabilitation of persons with TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury) forms the basis for this book.<BR> This book has two sections. Section one on identification and discussion of problems relating to sexuality after TBI with five chapters on TBI, disability and sexuality; a survey of the literature; physical and medical aspects of sexuality; effects of TBI on the human sexual response and a review of intervention techniques. Section two on intervention techniques has four chapters on suggested intervention program for staff; intervention for partners and family; suggested intervention program with survivors of TBI and the use of surrogate therapy in the intervention program. The book also has a useful bibliography and index.  <BR> We found the book very informative on how to plan an intervention program for persons in rehabilitation with illustrative case stories and even though the book is mainly for survivors of TBI, its message can be used for persons with other disabilities or even intellectual disability. We recommend this book for professionals working with people with disability in order to understand the issue of sexuality and rehabilitation in this population.	2003-12-06

It is the only children's charity in the United Kingdom with statutory powers that enable it to take action to safeguard children at risk of abuse. Together with John Wiley the NSPCC have started a book series in child protection and policy with the aim of a practical application to research.<BR> Evaluating family support is the result of a review and discussion of support for families on a national basis and the evaluation of that support. Ilan Katz, the team leader of the British Children's Fund prevention team and John Pinkerton, the head of the School of Social Work at the Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland, have together with 23 contributors looked at the need for international comparison in the evaluation of family support, the issues involved and studied the research available in countries like the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, England, Hong Kong, New Zealand, America, Australia and Sweden.<BR> This book shows the international or global perspective of family support with service and policy subject to constant tension that oftentimes undermine finding solutions for the problems facing the modern family, like the promotion of day care in other to have parents on the workforce versus the need for parents to spend quality time with their children. There has been a trend to think about an open or complex systems approach, where biological and social systems are not driven by equilibrium but by complex and constant change. Developing family support systems should therefore be based on a model that uses an ecological approach, a transactional model of development, resilience perspective and social inclusion.<BR> This book will be of value for policy makers and administrators responsible for servive and support of families.<br />Professor Joav Merrick, MD<BR>Director, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and Medical director, Division for Mental Retardation, Box 1260, IL-91012 Jerusalem, Israel, email: jmerrick@internet-zahav.net	2003-09-13

A journey of friendship, the use of the cellular phone or the web by the children and youth of today. This is also nostalgia from the books for children over the last 200 years with wonderful illustrations bringing back memories from our own childhood books with folk and fairy tales that are eternal.        <BR> The last chapter is concerned with children as consumers and the child market, where we are talking about billions of dollars and children have therefore in the last decade or so, become an important and very influential consumer market. Comic books which took off in the 1940s with the creation of Superman has been taken somewhat over by magazines, video-games and music.

In the United Kingdom in 1985 there were reported about 2,000 cases of rape offences against females, while in 1999 this number had increased to 8,000.

Besnier became médecin des hôpitaux in 1863 and subsequently held positions at several Paris hospitals. In 1873 he succeeded Bazin as dermatologist at the Hôpital St. Louis, where he became director the same year. In 1881 he was elected member of the Academy of Medicine as hygienist due to his contributions to epidemiology. In his special field, dermatology, Besnier tried to balance the differences between the French school and the Vienna school. With Pierre Adolphe Adrien Doyon (1827-1907) he founded the journal Annales de dermatologie et de syphiligraphie. He built histopathology and parasitology laboratories at the St. Louis hospital, and we owe to him the term and technique of biopsy. He is not mentioned in this book.<BR>Atopic dermatitis (atopic means alien, dermatitis means inflamed skin) or atopic eczema (eczema is Greek for to boil out) shows an inherited tendency to develop one or more of different types of conditions, like asthma, eczema of atopic type, allergic rhinitis or acute urticaria of allergic type. It is a major problem with more than 10% of the population suffering. Many children and their families will suffer and the condition create distress. Atopic dermatitis primarily is caused by cellular immune deficiency and elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE). The pathogenesis can be traced to a genetically inherited, bone marrow-derived cell associated with chromosome 11q. Abnormal skin reactivity also plays a major role in the development of the disease. Irritants to the skin are believed to predispose an individual to develop dermatitis more often than simply exposure to an allergenic trigger. Nonetheless, patients frequently have a history of food or inhalant allergies or eventually develop them. Children most commonly are affected with 80% developing the disease before age 7 years. Less than 2% will have an onset after age 20 years. Most sources agree that persistence after age 20 years is uncommon. Only an estimated 10% of patients older than 20 years continue to be symptomatic.<BR> Wiley publisher has started a new book series on \\"Understanding illness and health\\" with this book on \\"Childhhod eczema\\" by Penny Titman. She is a clinical psychologist from University College in London, but now working in a community team for children and families in an NHS Trust. <BR> This book has eight chapters with information on the medical aspects of this condition, treatment aspects including alternative treatment methods and full of case stories and practical advice for families that includes useful addresses and contacts. We lacked a few pictures, but understand that this would have made the book more expensive.

Early prediction and prevention of child abuse. A handbook. Chichester: John Wiley,  2002, 382 pages. ... (softcover).<br />This book is a new and updated version of a book published in1988 on the prevention of child abuse and neglect in the early pioneering days of child abuse research. The editors are an all British team from the University of Birmingham and Leeds with 38 contributors from the UK, USA and Australia.<BR> There are 21 chapters devided into four sections: Prevalence and prediction, primary and secondary prevention, tertiary prevention and working with offenders. <BR>  In section I it is interesting to note that over the last 25 years, when several countries started to collect data on child abuse cases on a regular basis, there has been observed some evidence that the prevalence of child abuse has decreased. This good information can maybe be attributed to the focus on preventive public health approach that many countries have taken after too many famous cases of fatal child abuse covered by the media over time. Section II is influenced by the 1979 book by Uri Bronfenbrenner on the ecology of human development, but very much relevant still today. In section III and IV the issue is tertiary prevention with focus on not only the child and family, but also the offenders. <BR> Much has happened since 1988 in many countires for a better prevention, intervention and switch to a comprehensive child health policy, but there is still a lot of work to be done.<BR> I especially liked the chapter by David Olds et al from Colorado on his last 24 years of research on nurse home visiting in the prenatal and infant period. Here you will find the evidence base for early intervention of the model of  the nurse visitor coming home already during pregnancy and continuing during infancy. This model was implemented in Denmark in 1936 on a national level and used by nearly 100% of all pregnant women in Denmark. David Olds etal in his studies in the Appalachian region of New York State (the Elmira study) and Memphis has shown that intervention early has functional and economic benefits with the greatest impact on families at high risk. Their Nurse Family Partnership now functions in 24 states and over 200 local communities in the United States. <BR> This book has value for a range of professionals, both in research and clinical practice, policy makers and managers working in the field of child protection, child and human development.<BR> <br />Professor Joav Merrick, MD<BR>Director, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and Medical director, Division for Mental Retardation, Box 1260, IL-91012 Jerusalem, Israel, email: jmerrick@internet-zahav.net	2003-04-11
