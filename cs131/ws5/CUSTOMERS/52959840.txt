More Often than an Author<br />Why do so many books get their start being published by the author? Rejection! The explanation is simple and let us not blame the publisher for failing to recognize good writing.<br />Publishers cannot be experts in every type of fiction and nonfiction. Let's face it, publishers specialize or, at least, they have a record of accomplishment with certain types of books. When your manuscript is rejected by a publisher, that is not a bad grade for your work. It simply means that the publisher does not get it! If a publisher specializes in travel books and you send a manuscript on vegetarian eating or parenting, that publisher will not know whether your work is good and will not know where to sell it. You do not want that publisher anyway. To find the right publisher for your work, do your homework and match your manuscript to the publisher.<br />Alternatively, to make more money, get to press sooner and keep control of your work, publish yourself. Self-publishing is legitimate, an early-American tradition. In the early days of the New World, the person with the printing press was often the author, publisher, printer and bookshop. Some people think that most of those who self-publish do so because several publishers have turned them down. That is occasionally true. However, most people today weigh the advantages and disadvantages of selling out to a publisher and make an educated decision to publish themselves. The big New York publishers (there are only five left due to consolidation) publish only 22% of the books. The rest come from the 55,000 small (mom &amp; pop) publishers and single-title self-publishers.<br />Self-publishing should not be confused with \\"Vanity\\" publishing where an author pays (an exorbitant price to) a publisher to turn his or her manuscript into a book.<br />Joyce Spizer's delightful book is a collection of inspirational quotations and short stories about well-known people who did not give up. Delightful and inspirational.<br />Dan Poynterrational.<br />Dan Poynter	2003-07-15

This book by Karen Lee Stevens is about those very special companions.<br />Do you have a special animal companion in your life? When you look into his or her eyes, what do you see? Do you consider this animal an integral part of your life--a member of the family? Most of us give our companion animals a great deal of affection and would never allow them to be hurt, abandoned, or abused. In return, they give us unconditional love and devotion.<br />This book allows you to explore many ways in which you can show even more love and appreciation for your own companion animals and gives you the opportunity for learning how to co-exist with all the animals who share our earth.<br />All for Animals doesn't describe painful animal experiments or show graphic pictures of animal suffering. Instead, the book offers quick and easy ways you can be kinder to animals and treat them with more respect. Even if you choose to do only a few things suggested in this book, you'll feel good about yourself for helping the animals.<br />Each chapter in All for Animals contains an uplifting, inspiring story about animals by such well-known authors as Gina Spadafori (author of Dogs for Dummies, Cats for Dummies, and Birds for Dummies) and Greg Louganis, Olympic gold-medal diving champion (For the Life of Your Dog), coauthored with Betsy Sikora Siino.<br />Additionally, story contributions have been made by Pets: Part of the Family, pets.com, Best Friends Animal Sanctuary, the National Humane Education Society, and many others.<br />Karen Lee Stevens is the founder of ALL FOR ANIMALS, a Santa Barbara, California-based pro-animal organization. Karen's love of animals began in early childhood where she spent countless hours as a volunteer at the Santa Barbara Humane Society. Through her Web site, online newsletter, and numerous magazine and newspaper articles, Karen seeks to educate consumers about cruelty-free living and respect for all animals. A graduate of San Diego State University's Business Administration and Marketing program, Karen now makes her home in Santa Barbara, California.<br />I enjoyed reading about Karen and Cassidy and I learned a lot about animals.

Whether you sell out to a large (New York) publisher or publish yourself, the author must do the promotion. Publishers only produce books and place them in stores. Authors must generate interest to encourage people to go into the stores to pull the books through the system.<br />There are two major categories of books: Fiction and nonfiction. Fiction is entertainment and as such it is more difficult to sell. Fiction must compete for people's (scarce) time. They must make choices between reading your story, and seeing a film and taking their kids to the zoo. Nonfiction, on the other hand,  is valuable information that people buy to save time and money. Each nonfiction book is unique; each is on a different subject. A nonfiction book on parenting does not compete with a nonfiction book on parachuting. Most publishers will caution you to write your nonfiction books first-and to save your fiction until you can afford them. If you are writing (and selling) fiction, you need industrial-strength help. Joyce Spizer is coming to your rescue.<br />This book is brimming with every conceivable book marketing and promotion idea. Some are expensive and some are free. Some are hard and some are easy. Some require you to personally flog your own book and some are (comfortably)  remote and anonymous.<br />As a publisher and an author of 113 books (including revisions and foreign-language editions) and over 500 magazine articles, I highly recommend this book to both authors and publishers of fiction.

Writing and promoting are completely different challenges. But, one person can successfully be the author, the publisher, the publicist, the shipping person, and the bookkeeper--and end up with a profit. This book proves it.<br />Suzanne Thomas's newest book, Make Money Self-Publishing, describes how fourteen publishers have written, published, and sold enough books to support themselves. You get the inside stories of real people in real life situations. Not only will you learn about their successes, but also about their mistakes. You will discover that you can succeed even if some of your marketing efforts don't produce the results you expected.<br />Whether you are new to self-publishing or already have several books in print, you will find how to increase the odds that your publishing company will make money. You will gain insights into how to determine the size of your print runs, how to market your books effectively, what type of income you can expect, and how long it will take before your publishing business can support you.<br />Perhaps you suspect that successful self-publishers are somehow different, but the publishers in this book are ordinary people. No matter whether you've written a regional or national title, fiction or nonfiction, a cookbook or a textbook, you will find someone here to be your role model. Instead of reinventing the wheel, you can learn from their experiences. Just like Olympic athletes who visualize themselves performing perfectly, and thereby improve their real-world abilities, so too can you leap ahead in your skill level as a publisher.<br />Even if you started your publishing company last week, reading Make Money Self-Publishing can help you gain years of knowledge, while avoiding costly mistakes. Each of the profiled publishers have faced the same problems you have. Given the limitations of their available time and their budgets, they have figured out the best ways to sell their books. Some sell through traditional outlets such as bookstores while others sell their books in electronic format or through Internet bookstores. You can live through their experiences vicariously, imagining what the results would be for your book.<br />Though the job of a self-publisher is challenging and satisfying, the day-to-day work can sometimes be discouraging. Along with the successes come setbacks. Perhaps a wholesaler returned a carton of your books. Maybe your sales numbers have started to drop. Or a public relations company hasn't produced results.<br />At moments like these it is important to have friends who can help with advice, but they aren't always available when you need them. The publishers in this book, however, can act as handy substitutes, conveniently waiting on your bookshelf. What did Cheri Thurston do to reduce returns from wholesalers? How did the Hoffmans rejuvenate the sales of one of their cookbooks after annual sales dropped to 1,000 copies? What did Gayle Mitchell do when she decided she could market her book better than the company she had hired?<br />Sometimes you won't be looking for solutions to particular problems. Instead you may want an injection of enthusiasm. Rereading your favorite chapters will inspire you to try something new, remind you of an idea you had forgotten, or motivate you to write the next book. Each chapter is a story, and beyond their educational value, they are also plain fun to read.<br />Make Money Self-Publishing is a valuable addition to any publisher's library. It's an invaluable reference for any self-publisher who needs encouragement and guidance. Suzanne's book provides you with valuable information sweetened by a huge dose of inspiration. If you want to make money as a publisher, then you should read this book.<br />Suzanne Thomas has succeeded at both publishing and real estate. Determined, focused and tenacious, she succeeds by helping others reach their goals.<br />As a publisher, author of 113 books (including revisions and foreign-language editions) and over 500 magazine articles, I recommend this fascinating book to anyone with a book inside them.each their goals. <br />As a publisher, author of 113 books (including revisions and foreign-language editions) and over 500 magazine articles, I recommend this fascinating book to anyone with a book inside them.	2000-11-01

Will Anyone know your book is available?<br />It does not matter whether you sell out to a large publisher or self-publish, the author must do the promotion. Everyone in the book industry has a role: authors write, publishers publish, printers print, authors promote, and bookstores sell. Authors promote? They must because no one else does.<br />The contract you receive from your publisher guarantees you a percentage of the price of every book sold. No one guarantees the number of books that will end up in the hands of buyers.<br />Do not be lulled into a false sense of security by thinking your publisher will promote your book. Your publisher will get your book into bookstores but you must get the buyers into the stores. Your book will be on the shelf for just four months. If it does not sell well, it will be pulled off and replaced with another front list book.<br />Just as a parent's responsibilities do not end with giving birth, an author's do not end with publication.

To understand why, here is what I wrote about writing books for children in my book Successful Nonfiction: Turning Thoughts into Books:<br />Some beginning writers think writing for children will be easier than writing for adults. Children are pretty sharp, and their attention span is usually much shorter.<br />Allana Elovson, a self-publisher of books about parenting, was reading to a young niece one day. The story was well received: The child was fascinated by all the pictures and listened intently.<br />When they finished the book, she smiled at her aunt and knowingly explained that the words were there for people who cannot read pictures.<br />Women buy 82% of all children's books and half are bought as gifts. Nearly 40% of the books are bought by mothers. Hardcover children's books are currently selling for $14.51, while softcovers are going for $7.34. Hardcovers with a dust jacket go for more than books without jackets.<br />According to Publishers Weekly, children's books fall into the following categories: 27% picture books, 17% books for babies and toddlers, 20% for younger readers, 19% for middle readers, and 17% for young-adult readers. Decide which category your work falls into.<br />Generally speaking, children's books are considered 50% text and 50% illustration so royalties are split between the writer and illustrator. If the royalty is 10%, then the writer and illustrator each get 5 percent.<br />Children's books tend to have a longer life than adult books. They start off slow and build over time. According to USA Today, October marks the beginning of a steady climb in the sales of children's books toward the holidays.<br />Be upbeat and send a positive message. So often children's stories center around mistakes and punishment, which sends a subtle message to a child about not taking risks for fear of harm.<br />\\"The secret to writing a successful children's book is not to think like a child or to try to remember what it was like to be a child, but to still be a child within.\\" -Andrea Brown, literary agent.<br />It is not what you say but how you say it-especially when writing for children. Violet Ramos takes you by the hand and gently guides you through writing exercises, step-by-step.

We try to avoid geographical references such as \\"About the size of Massachusetts\\". And we try to avoid (English/Metric) measurements. We call this writing in \\"Mid-Atlantic English\\". Then when a distant reader picks up our book, it does not seem as though it was written for someone else.<br />The American English Compendium goes even further. It explains and often translates proverbs, slogans, aphorisms, expressions, similes, metaphors, slang, colloquialisms, acronyms, abbreviations, nicknames and words. Writers, editors, translators and other wordsmiths will find this book a valuable reference and just fun to read.

Publishers produce and distribute books, they do not promote them (just ask an author). Your publisher will get your books into the stores but you must prompt the potential buyer to go into the stores to buy--and pull the books through the distribution system. Most successful authors spend a large percentage of their time promoting their book.<br />The conflict is that the author (normally a quiet, reclusive person) must become a promoter (a gregarious out-going person). What you need is some knowledgeable, friendly support. This book is your crutch.<br />Hosting events, mini seminars and workshops can provide an extremely profitable way to sell your book, other products and services. You will discover how to double or triple your profits by developing a marketing strategy, promoting more profitable events, designing your event to meet your audiences' goals, merchandising your books and other products, selling more books, products and services, making your presentation more exciting, handling the Q&amp;A, converting your speaking engagements from free to fee and much more. Lots of inside tips and techniques.<br />Eric Gelb, MBA, CPA, is an author, publisher and business consultant based in New York.<br />As a publisher and an author of 113 books (including revisions and foreign-language editions) and over 500 magazine articles, I recommend this book to authors and publishers.

How can I guard against others stealing my writing?<br />Relax. The moment you create a written Work, it is automatically copyrighted under Common Law. Once the book is published, you may send two copies to the Copyright Office with the two-page Form TX and $30 to register or perfect your copyright.<br />Some (new) authors copyright their manuscript. Later, when they turn it into a book, they print the original copyright date. This makes the book appear to be old, and that hurts sales.<br />Most authors wait and send the finished book to the Copyright Office for registration....<br />A registered copyright only gains the author some extra rights. The difference is between copyright and registered copyright, not between not copyrighted and copyrighted. Copyright occurs automatically with creation-when you initially write it.<br />Publishers rarely steal manuscripts. They are in the publishing business not the writing business. Manuscripts are cheap and publishers do not even have to pay the authors until months after the books are sold. There is little incentive to rip you off.<br />\\"The instinct of ownership is fundamental in man's nature.\\" -William James (1842-1910), American philosopher and psychologist.<br />2. How much may I borrow from others?<br />Borrow ideas, borrow facts, but do not steal words. Copyright covers the author's presentation or expression-a sequence or pattern of words. It does not protect ideas. If you read and blend the ideas of other authors and put the collective thought into your own words, that is perfectly legal. This is how most nonfiction books are written-from research.<br />Do not repeat any of the research materials word-for-word. Some of the material is not yours so copying could be plagiarism and you would be guilty of copyright infringement. Adapt the ideas from many sources so that your work is not substantially similar to any of them.<br />In Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Company, Inc., 111 S.Ct. 1282, 1287-88 (1991), the court held that the listings (facts) in a telephone directory were not protected by copyright.<br />Facts may not be copyrighted either; they are free for anyone to repeat or use in a manuscript.<br />\\"Copy from one, it's plagiarism; copy from two, it's research.\\" -Wilson Mizner, screenwriter.<br />The Copyright Permission and Libel Handbook is divided into two parts: the first covers copyright and the second covers libel (written defamation).

Only new authors sign and return a publisher's first offer. You may make changes to the contract and return it-that is a \\"counter offer\\". The contract may go back and forth until someone \\"accepts it.\\"<br />&quot;I took a distressing telephone call from an author who had just received a contract from a large New York publisher. There were a total of 21 items in the contract she didn't like or didn't understand. After discussing some of them, I suggested she call her editor and have a discussion. Better communication was certainly required here.<br />&quot;She called back two days later, both astonished and delighted. When she asked about the first paragraph in question, the editor said, \\"that's okay; you can have it.\\" She got what she wanted on the next paragraph in question too. On one other paragraph that concerned her, the editor said something like, \\"Well, that sounds like this but in the book trade it really means that; so it isn't a big issue.\\"<br />&quot;The result: she got 19 out of the 21 things she asked for.

Even though he was not heavy enough, he wanted to be a gripman on cable cars. He got the job--and just worked harder (heavier). One day, riding his motorcycle in San Francisco, he was hit but a truck. The resulting fire disfigured his face and took his fingers. He started Vermont Castings during the fuel crunch of the early seventies. One day, flying some executive friends in his small plane, the engine quit on takeoff; the crash left Mitchell paralyzed. He went on to be a talk show host, the mayor of Crested Butte, Colorado, and he even ran for congress. Today, he is a professional speaker who motivates audiences worldwide. Continually on the go, you have probably seen him in airports-ahead of you.<br />Change happens! You can be a victim or do something about it.

New software accelerates typesetting, new machines automate printing and the Internet streamlines promotion. These technological improvements have spawned a fresh way to look at book publishing. The New Book Model covers all the bases and is a refreshingly innovative route for anyone with a manuscript.<br />Today, books are written in page-layout format instead of double-spaced courier typeface. Then the pages are converted into Adobe Acrobat (PDF) format for printing and conversion.<br />Just 500 books are printed using computer-driven high-speed laser printers. The softcover and hardcover books are indistinguishable from traditional ink-printed books. Prices are just slightly higher, per unit, but the quantity (and invoice) is much lower.<br />PDF and LIT files are generated for reading on eBook readers such as the Pocket PC.<br />Then finished books are sent to two or three selected agents, a few more are sent to publishers with a track records for that type of book, 3-400 are sent for review to genre-specific magazines, four or five are sent to specialized book clubs, about ten are sent to foreign publishers suggesting translation and a handful are sent to opinion molders in the author's field.<br />If an agent or publisher comes in with a good offer, the author sells out. If not, all the bases are covered: the book is out for review and the orders are starting to come in.<br />Most of the book promotion is done via email; the author's web site replaces brochures. The media kit is replaced by a Press Room on the web site. Avoiding printing and postage reduces promotion costs tremendously.<br />So, the New Book Model is a way to conserve time, inventory space and money while testing the market. More books are not printed until after they are sold. It is no longer necessary to tie up a lot of money and inventory in printed books.<br />Dan Logan's book cover the marketing and selling of your book.

The best way I can think of to describe the value of Kirsch's Guide to the Book Contract is to quote from my own book Successful Nonfiction.<br />\\"The contract you receive from your publisher may be in two colors and printed on fancy paper but it is not chiseled in stone. Only new authors sign and return a publisher's first offer. You may make changes to the contract and return it-that is a \\"counter offer\\". The contract may go back and forth until someone \\"accepts it.\\"<br />\\"I took a distressing telephone call from an author who had just received a contract from a large New York publisher. There were a total of 21 items in the contract she didn't like or didn't understand. After discussing some of them, I suggested she call her editor and have a discussion. Better communication was certainly required here.<br />She called back two days later, both astonished and delighted. When she asked about the first paragraph in question, the editor said, \\"that's okay; you can have it.\\" She got what she wanted on the next paragraph in question too. On one other paragraph that concerned her, the editor said something like, \\"Well, that sounds like this but in the book trade it really means that; so it isn't a big issue.\\"<br />The result: she got 19 out of the 21 things she asked for. So contract discussions do not mean pulling the wool over the eyes of your publisher. This was a win-win negotiation.<br />\\"Take the contract to a book attorney (not just any attorney, not a contract attorney and not a media attorney). When it comes to literary properties and money, you need professional help. And make a counter offer.\\" Kirsch's book will help you understand the publisher's contract.<br />Jonathan Kirsch is a well-known book critic and book attorney in Los Angeles.<br />As the author of 113 books (including revisions and foreign-language editions) and over 500 magazine articles, I highly recommend this book to writers and publishers everywhere.

Rita Emmett started at the top in approaching a literary agent, and her first choice accepted her. The book, with a working title of The Complete Procrastinator's Handbook, was a user-friendly, fun approach to helping people conquer procrastination. She sent off a rough draft of the manuscript to her agent, and it was returned with suggestions for a format, plus instructions that Rita polish it and return it as soon as possible.<br />Then the winds of change tornadoed Rita's life. Family illness, death of a loved one and marriages of her children sent her life spinning, so she decided to \\"put the book on the back burner\\" while she concentrated on these more important life events.<br />It was not procrastination, it was a choice, a priority-and that was reasonable. But she never communicated to this decision to her agent-and that was inexcusable.<br />Three years later, Rita's life finally settled down. It was time to return to the book. She could not not do it. Although the contract had expired, she felt-morally and ethically-that she should give her agent the choice of working with her or not. More than that, she really wanted to work with the agent. But Rita was too embarrassed about the lapsed time, and she dreaded making that phone call. Thus began a year of procrastination-phony excuses, being too busy, anything to put that phone call as far from her mind as possible. The irony of putting off a book about procrastination was too painful to talk about. It added to her embarrassment.<br />The day came when the dread of making that phone call was making Rita sick. She had hit bottom and she finally decided to summon her courage and use every trick in the book-her book-to make that call. The agent courteously listened to her and graciously offered to look at her new manuscript. Rita's procrastination had ended.<br />The agent found a publisher, negotiated a wonderful advance, and that's the end of that story-and the beginning of Rita's life as an author-and as a Recovering Procrastinator. Rita writes from personal experience-she has been there! DanPoynter@ParaPublishing.comurteously listened to her and graciously offered to look at her new manuscript.
