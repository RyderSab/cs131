I love short stories to begin with, and this is one of, if not the absolute, best short stories book. Ms. Parker pokes fun at high society, everyday life, the art scene, and pretty much everything establishment, keeping a straight face while pointing out all the absurdities and little hypocrisies of people. Many of the tales are the right-out funny kind (Advice to the Little Peyton Girl, From the Diary of a New York Lady, Men I'm Not Married To); many others are equally ironic, though not the kind of irony intended to make you laugh (Big Blonde, Clothe the Naked, The Bolt Behind the Blue). I'm also happy to say the pass of time hasn't dulled the punch of it; in fact, this is the perfect gift for your annoying friend, parent, or any other nostalgic of your acquaintance that won't stop pining for the good ol' times; for those more present-minded ones, there's also plenty of good stuff, as sharp today as it was when written (like my personal favorite, 'Professional Youth', published in 1923). In short, brilliant.	2001-01-27

El libro no puede ser mas kitsch, pero es refrescante y entretenido, con la picardia caracteristica del humor espanol (sorry, teclado en ingles). Es un poco al estilo Almodovar, que lo disfrutan mujeres jovenes, viejas, hombres, mascotas, etc. Por diferentes razones, por supuesto.	2000-11-17

This is not the usual Stephen King book, this one is actually pretty mellow, compared to Carrie, for example, (that was the first of his books I read, and I hadn't read anything that gory before), but it still has its share of scary stuff, like The Ten O' Clock people, and The Moving Finger (after I read that one I really felt kind of nervous about the bathroom sink for a few days). I only could't get through the essay at the end, Head Down, because I don't understand absolutely anything about baseball. My favorites were Dedication, The End of the Whole Mess, The Ten O'Clock people, The House on Maple Street, and Popsy (oddly funny if you think about it). I suppose hardcore fans of King's horror will be sort of confused by this book, but I think any lover of short stories, like me, is bound to enjoy it.	2000-10-29

I picked up the book again recently and this time, the first thing that comes to my mind is whether a person like Hester really existed, and if all the things she had to go through without losing her serenity and aplomb happened the way it happens here. Hester Prynne is a married Puritan woman who was condemned to wear a scarlet letter A embroidered in her clothes at all times, to remind everyone of her sin: having a child, Pearl, with another villager whose identity she will not disclose. Being publicly recognized as an adulteress, Hester is a victim of her neighbors' scorn and the authorities' suspicion, even threatened to have her daughter's custody taken away from her, and in the midst of this, she discovers her husband's designs of revenge on the man he suspects of being her lover. Hester's personality and her suffering are superbly described, but the story in itself drags on excruciatingly from the beginning to about the middle of the book, and even from that point on, the prose is still very complicated and full of arcaic words and florid descriptions, that's why I say distraction is the last thing you need when reading it; you have to really want to read this book, but it will pay, if what you want is something that keeps you thinking about it well after you finish reading; I don't know why it is required reading in some schools and I certainly would not reccomend this book for occasional readers.	2000-10-29

I could not resist (I never even try when it comes to chocolate), so I bought the book, and for once I was glad to let my sweet tooth do my thinking. The story begins when a gentle, easygoing wanderer, Vianne, settles in a small French village and opens a chocolate boutique, drawing the attention of everyone, specially of a straitlaced, self-righteous priest named Reynaud (one word of advice to staunch Catholics: pick something else). Tension mounts on each side, or more like, in Reynaud's side, since Vianne pretty much ignores him. I love the underlying idea in the story that chocolate is connected with temptation, sin, and all bad things worth doing. And the ending was so good, I just laughed my heart out. The only thing I couldn't quite accept is the depiction of the villagers; the story would have been more believable if it had been located in a small New England town; the Puritanism of some of the characters just doesn't coincide with my idea of French thinking, but since I haven't lived in France I can't say more on the subject. Heavy readers, look for something else; this is light reading, only perfect for someone looking forward to have a good time and not to analyze.	2000-09-24

Usually I don't bother reviewing so-so books, but I have to ask: How could they include such women as Lady Di (oh, please), Jiang Qing, Eva Peron, Sonja Henie (Sonja who?), and what appaled me the most, Phyllis Schlafly, in the list? When I saw the book I though it would be about women who had helped to elevate our status and create better conditions for us all, but Schlafly appears here, and I quote &quot;as the woman who helped shot down the Equals Right Amendment(....)&quot; I was mad. Where are the truly deserving women, the ones that did try their best to leave the world a little better that when they found it? Where is Eileen Collins, Gabriela Mistral, Karen Horney, and why not, Audrey Hepburn (isn't she a way more reasonable choice than Jane Fonda?) I'll grant that they compiled a more or less good list of important women, but I'm glad I borrowed this book instead of buying it. I have better plans for my money.	2000-09-24

Dorian Gray, an astonishingly beautiful young aristocrat, receives the gift of eternal youth in the form of a painting one of his friends has made of him. Later, prompted by another friend, the divine dissolute Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian gradually falls into a dissipate lifestyle and the eerie painting shows both the ravages of age and the advance of Dorian's moral decay, while he retains his breathtaking looks. As Dorian becomes more and more obsessed with the painting's worsening appearance, the changes in his once sweet and naive personality are explained in the story, and Dorian lives in fear of the painting being exposed to the world, therefore showing him beyond any doubt as the sleazy creep he is, until it comes to a point when the gift  he prized so much ends up turning against him. Dorian Gray is one of the least likable characters I have seen on print, but I really liked his wicked friend Lord Wotton, who in the story is the one in charge of leading Dorian astray and dishing criticism after witty criticism of nineteenth century English society. I later learned this particular character was a sort of mockery of Oscar Wilde himself. A mellower version of this character can be found in another of Wilde's works, Lord Arthur Savile's Crime, my second favorite story by this author.	2000-09-24

Just to think that this clever,  precocious girl had to suffer confinement and a terrible death simply  because a bunch of kooks didn't like her kind makes me cringe. And still,  Anne states: &quot;In spite of everything, I still believe people are good  at heart&quot;. I think it sums up the essence of the diary, naive and wise  at the same time. She recounts her life before and after she and her family  went into hiding to escape Nazi persecution, and the hardships they had to  suffer, and not precisely because of Nazi harassment; the squabbles and  pettiness of some of the annex dwellers could seem in some ways worse than  the war going on in the outside world. Although the strained situation in  the annex affected Anne very much, she does not despair; she spices her  accounts with hilarious and often wicked comments on the people around her,  mixed with the difficult, sad situations she had to endure. It isn't really  much of an historical reading, it contains little about World War II  itself, but it is more a story about coming of age in very unusual  circumstances. What a shame Anne Frank had to die, had she survived she  probably would have produced an even better work than this one.	2000-09-07

Sometimes we find it so hard to understand our loved ones' point of view,  just like the Chinese-thinking mothers and their Americanized daughters  depicted here. I love every story in the book, but the ones I liked best  were the ones about Waverly Jong and her childhood struggles with her  upstart mother; An-Mei Hsu's mother, the Fourth Wife, and her final revenge  against the man that ruined her life; and Suyuan Woo's life during the war,  and her Long Cherished Wish. All the stories are enthralling and wistful,  and the clash of the modern, urban lifestyle of the second generation  against the first's more traditional one is amazingly, beautifully  described. After you've read this book you'll be left craving more, so run  and get the other books by Amy Tan, which are as excellent as this one.	2000-09-01

Scott Fitzgerald. I have to say it was a excellent  introduction to the author; I've also been told that this book is one of  Fitzgerald's less accomplished works, and I did find it a bit lacking on  something, I don't know what, but I enjoyed it anyway. Amory Blaine,  although richly described, is not a particularly likable character, but he  is certainly bright and his capacity for self analysis is amazing, though  his little why-is-everyone-but-me-an-idiot attitude can grate in your  nerves sometimes. Oh well, I guess that can be forgiven, considering his  age; I also believe (sometimes) that at my ripe old age of nineteen I  already know all I'll ever need to know about pretty much everything.  Speaking of which, I loved that line, &quot;I know myself, but that is  all&quot;, I think it about sums up the whole story. I can't wait to get my  hands on the next book by F. Scott Fitzgerald.	2000-08-31

Okay, okay, so Salinger made a great depiction of a little loser, but is that enough to consider a book a classic? I can think of a few authors that  have done more or less the same thing and have gone unnoticed. Yes, I found  the writing to be quite brilliant, it does a great job introducing the  reader into the world of Holden Caulfield, but no amount of brilliancy can  make me feel even a bit simpathetic towards Holden, he's one of those  people that I would instantly detest if I happened to meet him in the real  world, he's so whiny and stupid, he can't stop complaining about everything  that doesn't sit well with him, but instead of showing some backbone and  trying either to do something to change at least a bit the stuff he doesn't  like, or to adapt himself to the situation, he sulks and cusses, and dreams  of running away and hiding in the wilderness, where he won't have to cope  with the cold cruel world. I can appreciate his idealistic cynicism, but  that's about the extent of my charity. I don't share other reviewer's  feelings that the plot is uninteresting and/or inexistent; I'll admit is  not a wild ride, but it is engaging, and it is quite interesting to witness  Caulfield's teen angst (I hate that expression, I never was like that at  that age or at any age, and I'm nineteen, so don't think I have forgotten).  I'll concede that, all in all, J.D. Salinger managed to pull off a good  story, and that is no small accomplishment in this case; I would give  another of his books a try.	2000-08-18

In order to cope with the pain and impotence of  seeing her cherished daughter slowly dying, she tells her the story of  their family and examines their relationship between themselves and those  around them, intertwined with the development of Paula's illness and her  progressive decline. The stories are outrageous, droll, sad, endearing, and  moving; those who have read her previous books will find many interesting  things here to complement them, taken right out of the author and her  family's lives. Nobody can resist this mixture of laughs and tears, and the  author manages to convey her feelings of despair and sadness, but without  too much sentimentalism; it is impossible to pity her, the way she fights  with all her strenght to keep her daughter from suffering and the ravages  of her disease. This is not only a memoir, but also a mother's testimony of  love and courage.	2000-08-18
US	49987678	RNOAW4VCKFJQH	0140119906	702863006	Love in the Time of Cholera (Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century)	Books	5	9	10	N	N	The ultimate love story	The true meaning of love is amply explained in this beautiful, magical  story. Florentino Ariza, a slight, plain young man with a gift for poetry,  falls deeply in love with a lovely rich girl, Fermina Daza. Undaunted by  the trifling detail that his beloved decides to marry a richer, classier  guy than him, Florentino retreats and waits for the moment he can be with  the love of his life again. In the meantime he builds a fortune and nails  anything that wears a skirt, even his adolescent ward later in the story,  when he is an old man, but always in the utmost secrecy for fear Fermina  might find out about his philandering and feel betrayed. But hard-hearted  Fermina doesn't have time or the inclination to pay attention to her former  beau's comings and goings, busy as she is trying to make a success of her  marriage to Dr. Urbino, who, in spite of some occasional flaws, is as kind  and generous a husband as anyone could ask for. In some respects, Fermina's  marriage is very much like Florentino's liasons with different women, none  of them really loves their partners, or at least they don't feel the corny,  stars-in-your-eyes kind of love that is seen in movies and the like, but  they build a kind of relationship with their partners that is more precious  than those romantic notions of love. Florentino's relationships with his  mistresses is remarkable, they aren't just lovers, they also share  confidences and great friendships in most cases. The characters are well  defined and endearing, I specially liked sensible, smart Leona, and the  storyline, although it may confuse other readers accustomed to more linear  prose (hey, this is Garcia Marquez), is engrossing and draws the reader  into it. I felt the ending was missing something, I don't know what, but  overall I liked it very much. I would give it six stars if it was possible.	2000-08-14

I only wish  someone had told me that before. Anyway, better late than never. I found  Ms. Begoun's advice most useful, although she focuses a bit too much on the  age 40 plus group. The research she has made in beauty products is very  thorough and informative, although the colors she recommends are a bit too  drab for my taste, but then, I'm nineteen, so I can still get away with  green nail polish and body glitter now and then. Thank you Paula, for  helping me save my hard-earned bucks instead of throwing them away in  hope-in-a-bottle scams.	2000-08-12

The story, although goes  on forever (which think is okay, since I like to read, but many people I  know complain abouth the lenght of the book) is so engrossing, so minutely  descriptive and fascinating, even people who don't care for this kind of  work will have at least to recognize the painstaking job of researching and  piecing together the facts about American Southern life in the years of the  Civil War. And the characters are something else. My absolute favorite  literary heroine is Scarlett O'Hara, even if she was so stupid sometimes  she made me desperate, and Rhett... well, sometimes I almost felt sorry for  him, for all his macho-man behavior. Almost. You can't really feel sorry  for a guy like this. And I loved the ending too, it was just right for the  story. Anyway, I highly recommend this book to anyone, it deserves its  reputation as a great classic, and by the way, so does the movie, even if  it's not quite like the book, but that's to be expected, I guess.	2000-08-12

Anyway, this book is  terribly, terribly bad, nasty, ugly, whatever you want to call it, but also  engrossing and enjoyable. At least I enjoyed the crazy, soap-operatic plot,  and January Wayne really is an endearing, touching character, always  looking for happiness in all the wrong places and trying so hard to be  loved. In other case I would have ruthlessly dictaminated that she was a  moron, but she spent the best years of her life cooped up in a secluded  clinic, so it's easier for me to understand her astounding naivete. The  other characters are less likable, even January's father, for all his  practicality and relative good sense, although Karla is quite a person, and  not nearly as stupid as she tries to make others believe. Very, very bad  book, but very, very well written and thought-provoking.	2000-08-12

So mommy doesn't hesitate to go out looking for her  baby even if it involves passing herself off as a prostitute, which is sort  of difficult since she's the least knowledgeable woman on earth in this  kind of, uh, career, and those who are can spot her right away. Her  innocence and beauty often put her in uncomfortable and frequently  hilarious situations with all sorts of men, ranging from a serious, uptight  American judge to a Chicano wrestler that just knows she's the woman for  him. Esperanza is an endearing character, especially because she's not in  the least aware of the effect she has on men, blinded as she is by her lack  of worldliness and her drive to find her missing daughter. It does seem  kind of absurd that she has this much power over men without even thinking  about it, and even more absurd is the fact that she manages to come away  from her experiences without losing her naivete, but then, this is magic  realism. It is a funny, lighthearted little story, sweet and sad, just  right for a vacation read.	2000-08-04

That is not to say the book is bad, not at all; it's charged with  suspense and mystery from the moment Mr De Winter brings home wife number  two, a simple young girl with the personality of a rabbit, who as soon as  she arrives to Manderley is intimidated by the memory of the incomparable  Rebecca, as present in her death as she was in life. Terrorized by a creepy  servant who idolized her former mistress, bit by bit the second Mrs De  Winter reconstructs the past of her new family and, of course Rebecca's. In  some parts the story becomes a little heavy, besides, I found the  atmosphere quite depressing, but I think that adds to the story, that sense  of dread that comes from feeling Rebecca's awesome presence all over the  lives of those involved with Manderley. It's a very, very good book, and  I'm anxious to see the movie Hithcock made based on it, only him could do  justice to this kind of story. A perfect choice to read in a stormy night.	2000-07-16

Jane Eyre is still a very good book. Its main attraction is the superb description of Jane's problematic life and the character's in the  book. A good story must draw the readers into it, making them feel like  they're witnessing the action firsthand, and Jane Eyre does it beautifully.

I adore Anita, it's about time someone wrote about a heroine who's  not a six-feet tall bundle of muscles, Linda Hamilton style; we small women  can be real tough, too. The story is interesting and engrossing, although I  could do without the parts where hunky werewolf ex-boyfriend Richard is  quarreling with Anita, it's totally irrelevant to the story and besides, it  should be illegal for exes to behave the way Richard does; no wonder she  liked Jean Claude better, he's just divine and doesn't whine as much.

Lee's writing is totally unpretentious and straightforward, yet vivid and poignant.

To think that there are still women  that have to read a book like this in order to realize that they should get  a life and stop acting like lovesick losers chasing men around makes me  want to scream.

I don't know, and after I've read this book, I really don't care. I've read quite a few things about Evita's life and her death, but this is by far the best I've ever read. The author does a wonderful job weaving the stories about Evita, her virtues  and shortcomings, the people who loved her and hated her passionately.  Personally, I have mixed feelings about Evita: I admire her deeply for her  courage and ambition; she had been insignificant, her chances to become  what she became practically nil, and yet she is considered a mother, a  manipulator, a despot, a saint, decades after her death. From that point of  view, I can almost overlook her ruthlessness, her bitterness, and the way  she twisted things to suit her. Personal feelings aside, if the facts about  her life aren't enough to get you hooked on this book, the circumstances  surrounding the fate of her embalmed corpse are more then enough to draw  you into the story. Be careful, though, because even after you put the book  down, you still will feel Evita's magnetism pulling at you.	2000-04-30

I mean, a kid might enjoy Huck and Jim's mischief, but they wouldn't really appreciate the quality and wittiness of this book. I also can't understand why some people say  this is a racist book; the impression I got is that Twain was actually  mocking the narrow-mindedness and prejudice of white society at that time.  Anyway, I think this book is funny and satirical, and the characters are  very well defined and charismatic; their combination of naivete and wisdom  is really endearing. Okay, some of the situations are quite absurd, and  sometimes Huck's penchant for criticizing everything that doesn't sit well  with him are somewhat tiring, but on the whole this is a great story, and I  reccommend it to everyone that can keep an open mind while reading, because  I believe this book is definitely not an easy read, despite what others  say, or at least not as easy as it seems on the surface.	2000-04-29

Both the show and the book are quite silly, but reallyentertaining; I always pick this guide up when I'm blue and need to laugh a little. The only thing I didn't like about it is that ends with an episode that is already dated (D'oh!) so I would suggest Matt Groening to start working on a new guide.	2000-04-07

Only Jane Austen could take such a cliche and turn it in a beautiful story, romantic but not corny, witty, and evocative. Okay, the dialogue is somewhat difficult to follow, especially for those of us whose first  language is not English (the first time I tried to read this book I just  couldn't get past the first couple of pages), but once you get used to it,  you instantly fall in love with the story and the writer. I have read most  of Jane Austen's books, but this one remains my favorite.	2000-04-04
US	49987678	R14J3ZT3L4S46Z	0374516812	9117281	The Lottery and Other Stories	Books	5	2	2	N	N	One of my favorite short stories	No suspense tale has ever impressed me as the Lottery did; I mean, what can be more innocent than a small town lottery? But then the author gives it a great twist when she turns it into a horrible, inhumane tradition.  Just for the originality of the idea I give it two stars, and the other  three are for being so well written, it's just chilling. By the way, I also  saw the movie starring Keri Russell, which is OK, but of course, not even  comparable to the quality of the actual tale.	2000-04-02

I had the best time reading it; it's really clever, sometimes sad, definitely wry, and wonderfully written; with some of the essays I  didn't know whether to laugh or to cry. Most of them are touching, others  are plain hilarious (everyone should read &quot;If Men Could  Menstruate&quot;, I laughed until the walls rattled).	2000-04-01

It's really erotic, but tasteful and refined; it also is cleverly written and sensual, so much that you'll be transported into the stories. I didn't like two of the tales at all, but if you leave them  out, this is a very good book. I also reccomend Anais Nin's diary.	2000-03-31

The first time I read this book I finished it in three days, because I just couldn't put it down. It's so engrossing you might come to believe the absurd things that take place in Macondo are possible (one guy's blood  trickles across town until it reaches his mother's house in order to let  her know he's dying; a woman so beautiful that men go crazy and die after  they've seen her face; and it goes on like that) If you haven't read this  book, buy it right now; if you have, read it again, you'll probably  discover something you hadn't noticed before.	2000-03-31

It is cleverly written, very  sensual and charming, perfect for a lazy, rainy afternoon.	2000-03-05

Her misterious and sinister personality, unusual in itself, was even more incredible considering that the story takes place in the Venezuelan llanos  (plains), a male domain, and at a time when a woman's place was considered  to be at home. Even if you don't like the story, which I found wonderful,  the character of Dona Barbara alone is reason enough for buying this book.  The ending is also great, it couldn't have been better.	2000-03-02

Although I enjoyed the movie, it can't be compared to the book. The characters are so realistic you can almost touch them and the story is so simple and yet  so rich, I can't imagine anyone not liking it.	2000-03-02

But I've read this book about  five times and still can't get enough of it. I also recommend Once Is Not  Enough, by the same author	2000-03-02

I love the main character, Eva Luna, a strong young woman with a no-nonsense approach to life and love. The stories are enticing and complex, so well  written you'll feel you're actually living the scene. Read it and then buy  the sequel, Tales of Eva Luna, which is also excellent.	2000-03-02

The description of Havana's sizzling nightlife before the revolution is fantastic, you will  actually feel you're partying with the characters, and just for the way  Cuquita, the main character, makes fun of herself (and practically everyone  else, including you-know-who) and her delusions with a man that rarely  gives her a thought, I can almost forgive her stupidity in waiting for him  for thirty years. The ending depressed me, though. Tip: if you can, read it  in its original language.	2000-03-01

I recommended this book to all my friends; perfect for a nice, quiet afternoon, although if you are that kind of person that can't put up with other people's constant blundering, don't read it, it will only get on your  nerves.	2000-02-27

I wasn't dissapointed at all. I loved the idea that a whole book was centered around the sense of smell, which has such a big impact in our  relationships with people, yet is so often overlooked; the author has  reflected that in a flawlessly written novel, dripping with irony and  sensuality. I can't wait until I'm able to read the book in its original  language.	2000-02-27

The recipes are sinfully delicious (and calorie-laden), and the tales are tastefully erotic and funny, just as I expected from the author. If you  haven't bought it, do it now; even if you don't like it, you still could  learn a useful thing or two.	2000-02-27

They're simply beautiful; the stories are as glittery and fascinating as a Chinese silk gown and the characters are so real I can hardly believe they  don't exist. I felt very dissapointed abut the fact that Winnie's horrid  jerk of a husband wasn't punished as he deserved, but overall this is an  excellent book.	2000-02-27
