I am very impressed with this book. It is enjoyable to read. It feels as though you are listening to the author explaining things to you as he speaks.  <br /> <br />Each chapter is succinct and precise. This book takes you from novice level to a good understanding of MIDP 2.0 and J2ME.  <br /> <br />I am very glad I read this book 1st. I intend to get the authors other book, which is on C++ too. He not only knows his stuff; but can teach it very well.	2004-10-11

I echo the other review of this book. When I saw its title before it was actually published, I ordered it immediately. I am developing leading-edge apps for Series 60 in particular and have found this book to be very useful indeed. I am going to be giving Symbian OS C++ training in Australia and Asia, and I intend to use this book as one of my textbooks to hand out at the courses. The other book I would recommend as a companion is &quot;Symbian OS C++ for Mobile Phones&quot; by Harrison, which is a good book; but focuses more on UIQ than Series 60.	2004-04-16

With PocketC you can write programs of reasonable complexity.<br />If however you are wanting to write complex programs, you have to get &quot;Palm OS Programming: The Developers' Guide 2nd ed&quot; by Neil Rhodes and Julie McKeehan, it is excellent.

It is truely excellent. Yes there are areas it would be nice to cover in more detail; but there are also specific books such as Palm Database Programming that go into these areas in more depth.<br />I have lectured at college, and am planning to give a semester course in Palm Programming, and I intend to have each of my students buy this book as the major text.<br />I shall always buy the latest most current edition of this for my bookshelf.<br />Excellent work and praise for the two authors!

After reading it, I bought about 20 copies to give to friends for Christmas. It is a great book. Without giving away the true story, it is about the hard life of a man, told by himself as though you are sitting at his knee as a grandchild.

I bought a few books, which have been useful; but this is the one I would recommend if you wish to be a knowledgeable user of Flash. Yes, it starts out to be a basic guide and by the end of the book you have been introduced to how and where Flash should be used, and as a bonus, you get an intro into using XML, PHP and MySQL. This is a true thumbs up, 5 stars from me. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a start in Flash programming.	2003-08-27

And those who go away and read Dune, change their mind and usually will seek other quality SF novels to read.<br />I first read Dune in about 1967(?) as a high school student. I have re-read it many times. To me it was the first hard SF novel to FULLY develop and reveal an entire culture and history as backdrop to the story. Others have tried since; most have failed or at least fallen short of Dune.<br />DUNE is to SF what Lord of the Rings is to Fantasy; simply the best.<br />If you want to know anything about the story, don't look here, just READ IT!

This book takes the beginner from scratch to being able to competantly handle PostgresQL databases.<br />The only real drawbacks as far as I could see are the lack of some python examples, and the use of MS Access. Even though I am a linux convert, I am not necessarily biggoted against Micro$oft. <br />But while I have a wealth of RDBMS background, I needed to know two things: one, how to configure and execute postresQL under linux, and two, what GUI tools are available to do this.

I don't really understand the negative views about this book. As a professional programmer across multiple platforms and multiple OS's, I have found few books as useful as this one. I don't work in the Linux / Unix area that often; but when I do this book is of great help escpecially when I need to do scripting on one Unix system (say Korn shell) and then jump to another (say Bash or Bourne). This book has saved me a lot of time and sweat when I needed help.    I was actually looking for a postgresql book, when I spotted this one. I have only recently had the need to get heavily into Unix and Linux scripting, and have had my eye out looking for something good. WOW, what a book! I thought that I would have to buy at least six books to get what is in this ONE book. The author has made the book very readable. The content delivers what it promises. Even early in the book I was learning not only new stuff; but reasons why some stuff I already knew worked the way it did. I know there is a shell web site called shelldorado; but this book is 24 carat gold. One of those books you carry under your arm as you move between workstations.    I would buy any books by this author. I would attend any courses as well, if they were in my area. Well done Ellie!	2002-01-27

I was SO impressed that I bought 25 copies to give to friends for Christmas.<br />Bert Facey, the man that this book is about, speaks to you from the book as your grandparents would tell you a story whilst you sat at their knee.<br />It is beatifully told. Such courage in adversity, stoic in enduring pains, the love he shows to his family.<br />I wish I could tell you more; but I belive that reviews that tell you about a book ruin the story.<br />It has my highest recommendation!

However, one night when I was reading it, I suddenly flung it across the room in anger after reading a section about &quot;man's inhumanity to man&quot;. Even though the movie is very good, it does not even come close to doing justice to the book.<br />True heroes are people such as Oscar Schindler, a man that deserves to be honoured in our hearts and minds forever.

Being a lover of all things ancient Roman, from the Latin language to the classical culture and also being a longtime student of Latin and Mandarin, I was very much looking forward to this book.<br />However, from the viewpoint of the anticipated content of this book, and its actual contents, I was disappointed. I was expecting a 'blow by blow' description of the search for the ancient Roman heritage of Li-Jien (the Roman influenced towns of ancient China) and its discovery; but instead it was more of a 'how to survive in China on $10 a day' book combined with social commentary and an insight into the author's lovelife.

I bought this weighty tome (AU$115) because it had a section on XML and Java and some specific code that appeared to be what I needed for an urgent project. Firstly, the book did not come with a CD, so you had to download the code. Once you downloaded the code, it became apparent that the code for the chapter I was interested in (chapter 42) was not amongst it. I had to type it all in. I had difficulty compiling the code, which may have been some misunderstanding on my behalf. I finally got it to compile; but kept getting runtime errors. I couldn't get it to work. <br />I gave up. <br />I expect when I purchase a book, that most if not all (no one is perfect) the examples will work. I also believe that expensive and expansive books like this one should come with a CD that not only fully reflects the code in the book; but also contains a HTML version of the book as well to facilitate searching.<br />My comments only reflect upon the Java XML chapter 42. I have been reluctant to use the book any further. I hope the next edition rectifies the present short-comings.	2001-01-02

I can't understand why this book has been so highly rated. I bought it on the basis of the other reviews. I have found it lacking in all the areas I have needed to look up. I have found one or two useful things as well; but  it seems to lack some basic (and I don't mean beginner) coverage. For  example INSERTs are covered; yet there isn't any coverage about how to  return an id from the INSERT. I believe the book could be improved just by  addressing some of the questions being asked on SQL/VB sites. I also did  not like the layout of the book.

I have read thousands of SF books over the last 38 years, and in all this time, there has never been any author  who consistantly 'produced the goods', so to say. I would give all of his  books a rating of 5 out of 5. Even this week I was mentioning this  particular book and 'Stobors' to work associates. I won't elaborate on  this, for those who have yet to read it. I have lost count of howmany times  I have re-read all of Mr Heinlein's books. Jules Verne is great, H.G. Wells  also, others shine too; but there is only one king, Robert Heinlein!	2000-06-23

Whilst I have been a programmer since 1969 and have used various methodologies in the mainframe  area, I had not come across a succinct, practical and easy to follow one  for the VB environment until now. Great book!	2000-05-16

This is one of those &quot;I wish I had been told about this at school&quot; type books. If I had to name a dozen must have books, this would be in my top five. It is simple, entertaining and applicable to  everyone. After I read it, I bought copies for each of my children and  close friends. A great book.	1999-10-07

And please remove the puerile humour, it doesn't work; humour in a book should be like safron in a curry,  appreciated for its subtlty. Have a look at the 'Teach Yourself Java 1.1 in  24 hours' for an author who uses humour to great effect.
