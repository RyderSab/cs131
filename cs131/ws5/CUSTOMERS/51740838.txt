There is something serious and very interesting at work in John Kenneth Muir's entry into the new (and hopefully long-lived), series of &quot;Space: 1999&quot; novels from Powys Media.<br />Set sometime after the events of Year One of &quot;Space: 1999&quot;, Muir's tale involves Alpha's role (intentional and otherwise), in the extermination of a new race. Along the way, we are privy to the philosophical and important discussions of humanity's role in the Universe that were so common in Year One of the classic series. We also are introduced to characters and sociolgical facets of the future Alpha in Year Two.<br />Also on disply is some great discussion of the oft-rumored &quot;cosmic intelligence&quot; pulling the strings from behind the curtain. Finally, the realization that something larger is at work in the Universe dawns on the Alphans, and is discussed more openly than ever before.<br />Fans of Paul may not be overly happy with Muir's solutions, but there are solid &quot;Paul&quot; moments, and we get a peek into the hidden lives of the Alphans in a logical and mature way.<br />The story is a very interesting bridge between Year One and Two, which fans all know were radically different from each other. Most of the forshadowing of Year Two is in some locations and future construction plans (and the intorduction of Tony, as well as the all-but-forgotten Year Two supporting character, Bill Fraiser), but it is mostly displayed in the impatience of several supporting characters. Year Two characters were generally of a surlier nature, less inclined  towards introspection and resignation as the characters were in Year One. Having been cooped up on the base for so long, resentment of Koening and his command staff festered, many Alphans wanting to challenge authority and get off the wandering moon at any cost. &quot;Green sickness&quot; or &quot;embarkation syndrome,&quot; and even outright mutiny, are all hallmarks of Year Two, and we see those and other seeds of discontent brewing here in Muir's novel.<br />If the book has a failing, it is that there are, perhaps, too many references to past series events, as if Muir was trying to stuff in as many references as possible. He needn't have bothered, because he's spot on with the characters and sentiments of our favorite lunar castaways.<br />Year One and Two, radically different in tone, pace, and styling, are merged here in a sensible way, albeit in an uneasy coexistence. Fans should still check this one out, though, because you probably won't find a better attempt to bring Alpha back to life in novel form than Muir's efforts here. Granted, &quot;Alien Seed&quot; by E. C. Tubb was a pretty good stab at it, as was the first novel in this series, &quot;Resurrection&quot;. But the difference here is, I think, because Muir is an admitted and unabashed fan of the series.

This is as unique an effort to capture the essence of the Mycroft Holmes character as I have ever been fortunate enough to enjoy. Second probably only to Quinn Fawcett's more recent work on the &quot;Brotherhood&quot; series, this 1979 novel by Michael Hodel and Sean Wright really brings the Mycroft Holmes character alive.<br />The authors explain how they stumble across the hidden manuscript in an antique store, and then present the work for the reader. I believe this book pre-dates or is a contemporary of the work of Nicholas Meyer, who used a similar device in his books (&quot;Seven Percent Solution&quot;, etc.), to explain how he came across new Sherlock stories. Hodel and Wright go a step further, and offer insightful footnotes throughout which help to illuminate past and future items in the Canon, as well as historical perspective.<br />In the manuscript (reportedly written in the clear, concise hand of Mycroft himself), a young Mycroft relates an adventure involving a political plot to embroil England in a second American Civil War. Murder and intrigue are the order of the day, and our hapless Foreign Office assistant is right in the middle! The pace rarely slows, and Sherlock is on hand to assist as he begins laying the groundwork to become the world's first consulting detective.<br />One of the interesting things about the story is that authors Hodel and Wright eschew the usual Dr. Watson stand-in, and allow the Mycroft character to relate the events in first-person. The result is a Sherlock story with a completely different and refreshing perspective. This is especially important as we gain an understanding of the Holmes/Moriarty feud.<br />The real mystery is why the book is not more well-known to followers of Mycroftia (let alone Sherlockia), and why there were no further Mycroft tales from these authors.	2003-09-17

Despite the low rating I have offered on this book, I have to admit that I enjoyed a good deal of it thanks mostly to Ms. King's wonderful ability to paint the story with detail and description that approaches the turn-of-the-century writing fitting for Holmes.<br />Unfortunately, the excellent descriptive elements of the narrative are wasted due primarily to the creeping paralysis of modern social views that take over the story from time to time. The book strays a bit too often into the desert of political correctness, if not blatant feminism (why, *naturally* a nineteen year old girl can be the intellectual equal of Sherlock Holmes, beat up a man twice her size, properly enlighten Arabs on respecting women, etc.).<br />Perhaps it is simply the author's personal need to speak out about the injustices of past history and lierature in the only way that she felt was open to her. While a noble cause (albeit somewhat misguided), I'd much prefer it be done on her own time and not on the time of those who enjoy a good Holmes story.<br />Even if the reader is not nettled by the &quot;enlightning&quot; of characters set a century in the past, there are still other problems with the book. For example, the main character (Russell of course, not Holmes), seems drawn to prattling about her religion (another personal stake for the author?). Doesn't seem to fit a Holmes story, but that isn't what we really have with &quot;O Jerusalem&quot; anyway.<br />The banner at the top of the paperback's cover reads: &quot;A novel of suspense featuring Mary Russell and her partner Sherlock Holmes&quot; (HER partner?! Holmes a second-stringer?!). Clearly this implies that Russell, not Holmes, is the star of the story (and she is), so why bother with Holmes at all? Why not just introduce the character and let her grow on her own as a 1920's detective? If the author desires to create a character such as Mary Russell, why not just do so?<br />The answer is that what we have here is yet another writer attempting to graft their own, new characters into the already well-established world of Holmes, both for support as well as marketing. After all, unless an author has name value (such as a Stephen King or John Grisham), chances are a reader will purchase a new book with an established character like Holmes rather than take a chance on a new series with an unknown lead like Russell.<br />If the new character being introduced has any worth at all (as the Russell character seems to have), then it should be able to stand on its own without the crutch of Holmes to support it. The fact that the author chose to tack on to her series the immortal name of Sherlock Holmes speaks more of a lack of faith in her new character rather than an honest desire to expand upon the world founded by Doyle.<br />Compare this series to the excellent work of Quinn Fawcett and his Mycroft Holmes books, and you'll see what I mean. Fawcett obviously respects the characters as offered by Doyle, in the world offered by Doyle. He expands upon them in a proper and fitting way, while at the same time introducing his new characters into the story. At no time do any modern, pet personal causes of the author take over the narrative, and so there are no distractions from the late Victorian setting of the story.<br />The pity is that Ms. King has a great talent for description and action that fits nicely with the style of Doyle. If only Ms. King would undertake to write a straight, old-fashioned Holmes/Watson mystery, rather than bowdlerizing the works of Doyle with modern viewpoints and characters, the Holmes audience would be much better served.r writer attempting to graft their own, new characters into the already well-established world of Holmes, both for support as well as marketing.

Sax Rohmer's work has been compared to Arthur Conan Doyle's often enough that I felt compelled to check it out, and discover more about Fu-Manchu beyond what I already knew about the character (that a certain kind of 1970's moustache was named after him).<br />At one time the West was terrified of &quot;Young China&quot;, and the forces at work in China that could conceivably have led to a radical alteration of the world's power structures. The Chinese were the bad guys because they were &quot;inscrutable&quot; (love that word!), and therefore frightening.<br />Without a doubt, the view of the author is rather dated, in his obvious bias against the Chinese (or at least they were handy villains for him). His constant allusions to the &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; and the unspeakable dangers posed to the white race by the yellow is in keeping with the times (1913), but a bit overboard nevertheless.<br />The book is more of a series of sketchy, running battles between the sinister Fu-Manchu and hero Smith rather than a standard, cohesive narrative. This should come as no surprise since the author cobbled together several of his Fu-Manchu short stories into this one single volume. However, the results of this process are mixed, and not totally effective. Not that it really matters, since this novel was successful enough to call for more and better stories with the homicidal genius.<br />This particular edition (Dover Classic Mysteries), is very inexpensive, and well worth the price of admission to experience the debut of Fu-Manchu, and to learn something about the social attitudes of the time in which he was created.	2003-07-31

One problem I find with watercolor instruction books about painting the human figure is that so few of them are in a style I actually like. Charles Reid has a few, of course, and there are some others that offer insights, but even so the styles are not always what I'm aiming for. Mel Stabin's &quot;Figure in Watercolor&quot; is a happy exception to that lamentable rule, although not without its shortcomings.<br />Overall, this is a fairly inspiring book with great paintings and a few nuggets of information about painting the figure, but I found that the actual instruction was a bit thin. There are a few step-by-step examples, but most of the book consists of Mr. Stabin's wonderful paintings, along with a paragraph or two about basic composition, studio conditions, or back story behind the painting.<br />Perhaps the artist was going on the assumption that the student should be given inspiration over step-by-step instruction. That can work very well in some instructional environments (such as college-level courses), but I think I would've found more of the step-by-step examples helpful. What few step-by-step examples there are in the book (three, I think), are condensed at best, and really don't give the student a good sense of how the painting was made (kind of like watching the opening credits, end credits, and a scene in the middle of a movie, and trying to understand what the movie was all about). Here we see an early step, a somewhere-in-the-middle step, and the finished painting. Even with the accompanying text, the complete evolution of the work is still something of a mystery.<br />One of the few really frustrating things about the book is that several of the large paintings that start the chapters are positioned in such a way that the figures (obstensively the most important part of the painting), are placed right between the inside edges, so that it is almost impossible to get a good look at the figure without flattening out the book (and thereby ruining the spine).<br />All in all, it's still a great book, but definitely aimed for an intermediate level, rather than the beginner. I'm not sure if that was the artist's intention, but it seemed to be the end result. Even so, the beginner will still find value in the book, in the form of inspiration if not direct instruction.e spine). <br />All in all, it's still a great book, but definitely aimed for an intermediate level, rather than the beginner.

Part of the charm of the three novels in the Beacon Hill series is that the environment is spot on. One should never attempt to write characters into an historical environment without first doing some basic research, and Ms. Peale has this angle very well covered. The mystery the author has contructed is also very interesting, involving the major fads of the day (both spiritualism and the telephone). Once more, Ms. Peale brings Victorian Boston to life in a vivid and appealing fashion.<br />There are some weaker moments, however, which are rather distracting. The late-night confrontation between Ames and the villain is pure melodrama, and for all of the action, it is actually rather disappointingly pedestrian. The same could also be said for the climax.<br />Just to nitpick, there is also at least one somewhat minor error regarding how to survive when immersed in cold water. A character thinks the only way to survive it would be to swim furiously, but doing so will bleed off far more body heat than you could possibly generate, leading to hypothermia (pretty much what happened to many of the Titanic's passengers). But, the character's thinking was in keeping with the times in which the story is set, so we may easily overlook this goof.<br />Since so much more of the novel works then does not work, I think it would be fair to say that this is a very good purchase, especially for those of us already hooked on the characters. The characters make natural progress in their world, evolving and becoming even more and more natural (Addington pursues the elusive Serena Vincent, while Dr. MacKensie is even so bold as to finally ask Miss Ames to go walking in the park!). The entire question of spiritualism is deftly handled, neither overly favorable of the practice, or overly critical. The characters are delightfully &quot;in character,&quot; as it were.<br />One can only hope that the series will move beyond a mere trilogy. It would be quite unfair of Ms. Peale to offer us such interesting characters and not allow us to continue to share in their domestic worries, social dramas, and criminal investigations.ch interesting characters and not allow us to continue to share in their domestic worries, social dramas, and criminal investigations.	2002-07-24

Childhood memories are faithfully recorded in a montage of images that we all know and remember.<br />The amount of detail in Spier's work is staggering, but not overdone. Everything just seems to fit. Upon repeat viewings, the reader captures another hidden detail. Obviously, Mr. Spier knew what it was like to live around older homes, with all of their idiosyncrasies. Here we see an old, uneven brick doorstep. Ornamental decoration on the pillars of the family porch. The assorted flotsom and jetsom that fills the yard of a large, old home, and the children's room in particular. All of these and more are extremely accurate reditions of an older home.<br />We also see the child's viewpoint of rain. The standing in running water by the curb, the walking under a broken gutter with your umbrella, the colors that jump out from rain-soaked flowers, the wind, the warm cocoa Mom provides upon returning home to tell of your adventures. All of it is here, and real, and true-to-life.<br />The story follows two children as they spend the day experiencing their world during a rainstorm. Nothing more. Nothing less.

This is a very slick, handsome book that details the process of illustrating children's books from the point of view of the professional illustrator.<br />I especially like how each artist is profiled. A single picture from a project is selected, and we see in about twenty steps how the work was done; from the initial concept all the way through to the finished piece. Then we have a few pages at the end of the artist's profile showing other work they have done in both the children's book arena and the commercial illustration market.<br />By going step-by-step, we get to see how a picture book is illustrated right from the start. We see concept sketches, research materiels and how they are used to shape the details in the images, and then the techniques of the artists as they work through to competion. We also gain insight into the creative process in the artist's mind, as each one explains why they choose to do a certain thing in a certain way.<br />Although I personally like to stick to watercolor or line & wash, several different techniques are highlighted here. Besides watercolor, gouche, collage, colored pencil, and even computer illustration is represented. Besides being interesting in their own right, seeing the different styles and techniques can offer up new ideas if like me, you prefer just one medium.<br />This is a great way to learn the craft, and how it works. If there was anything disappointing about the book, it would have to be the seemingly short length of it. I also would have liked to have seen master watercolorist Jon J. Muth profiled. Otherwise, this is a wonderful reference for the artist who is  serious about becoming a picture book illustrator.	2002-06-02

The story is linear, have a starting point and logical ending point, but many of the images in between could easily be shuffled about with no detriment to the overall book.<br />What we have here are snatches of personal memory, vignettes of both public and hidden moments, perhaps even just a glance that catches a simple image from a childhood Christmas past, all faithfully recorded in the mind's eye and replayed with each new Christmas season for years and years. I was struck by how carefully Mr. Speir was able to capture these images for us, all of which we instantly recognize in a sort of collective unconscious, or universal memory.<br />The ornaments packed away in the attic, the hectic shopping at grocery stores and shopping malls, hanging a wreath, standing outside in the quiet dusk to admire the Christmas lights and the tree in the window, a packed church service, carolers, bringing small gifts and a visit to the elderly nieghbors, the cat sitting by the electric candle on the window sill and looking out at the world, the silent night, the magic of Christmas Morning, the presents, the dinner, the relatives, the phone calls to old friends and family seperated by distance, the quiet moment by the fire at the end of the day.<br />Everything, absolutely everything is here, lovingly detailed by Mr. Speir's ink pen.<br />This is the perfect Christmas, with no fighting, no stress, no phony commercialism, no bickering children or adults. Like memory, Mr. Speir wisely highlights the good, the pleasant, the golden, the loving, and the ideal rememberances of Christmas.<br />A rare and wonderful achievement, and a Christmas book to be treasured.	2002-05-29

I was fortunate to find this book several years ago, and as a big fan of Tom & Jerry cartoons, it was like finding buried treasure.<br />The book covers in detail the many phases of the cat & mouse duo over the years, as well as a breakdown of each cartoon short they starred in. From the classic version (my most favorite), in wonderful creations such as the World War II themed \\"Yankee Doodle Mouse\\", to the early 1950's version that introduced Butch the alley cat, Spike the dog, and Quackers the duck (my second most favorite version), to the limited and poorly drawn 1960's version (my least favorite), to the \\"modern\\" versions of Tom & Jerry (also decidedly not a favorite), you'll find everything you'd ever want to know about our cat and mouse heroes between the covers of T. R. Boodman's loving tribute.<br />The history of Tom & Jerry is intellegently written and completely covered. The groundbraking marriage of live film of Gene Kelly with the animation of cat and mouse in \\"Anchors Aweigh\\" (and the decision to even attempt it), is explained in clear terms. The reproductions from the actual film stocks, animated materials, drawings, and concept sketches, are all stunning in their quality and completeness.<br />In short, if you are a fan of Tom & Jerry, then this is the book for you.

This book is one I picked up on a whim. I was drawn to it by the colorful cover illustration, and just had to purchase it.<br />What makes this book stand out is the absolutely gorgeous line art from Mr. Spier. The cover offers you just a hint of the exquisite detail in each and every drawing. I was struck by the amount of detail Mr. Spier was able to pack into each rendering, capturing accurately a wealth of details in the farming community. From a \\"working\\" barn interior simply brimming with accuracy, to the sagging rooflines of old farm buildings, to moonlit churchyards, dirt crossroads, and covered bridges, you'll swear this man must have lived extensively in a farming area all his life.<br />This is not a full-color text, which may disappoint some readers. Only every other page in the book is in full color, probably to save money when it was first printed many years ago in the early sixties. Pity, for the coloring makes each drawing leap off the page.<br />The time period is apparently rooted firmly in the early 1900's, when our nation was still agricultually based. Many details (such as antique portraits with the old-fashioned practice of dates on them), hint at a past time are liberally displayed.<br />Although the Ingram write-up listed on this catalog page indicates the story takes place in New England, this is probably not the case. While it is true that much of the art calls to mind New England, New Englanders do not raise tobacco. Here we see several tobacco barns where the leaf is dried, and notices for tobacco actions on barn walls and covered bridges. As such, I suspect Pennsylvania, or perhaps even Virginia as the locale, but what difference does it make? This is a whimsical tale from the past, which is all that matters.<br />Upon close inspection, the observant reader will note that the gray goose and the duck are both alive and kicking long after the fox steals them. In fact, you never actually see them being killed, just being prepared for dinner after the fact. None of the imagery is in any way graphic regarding the demise of the fowl. On top of that, we see both duck and goose join in with the sing-a-long at the end of the book, so the book should be okay for the younger children (of course, this depends on your own judgement).after the fact.

An interesting little picture book, \\"Max, the Stubborn Little Wolf\\" is a real charmer.<br />The story itself is, annoyingly, a bit PC. Max is determined to become a florist, over his father's objections, which make the tale seem almost like a plea for alternative lifestyle equality as much as it is a \\"be yourself\\" tale. I suspect this is not intended, but part and parcel of the story being translated from a different language. The text is certainly not harmful, and it isn't a bad story at all, so you may see what I mean whereas kids may not pick up on it.<br />Either way, the illustrations are just priceless. They bring out a dimension of humor not necessarily found in the translated text. An early illustration shows Max's father waxing nostaligic over a thought balloon with a little pig inside, neatly covered in dotted lines denoting the various cuts of pork. Another drawing shows the Father Wolf shaving first thing in the morning! Absolutely hilarious illustrations abound on every page, as the Father is continually frustrated in his attempts to make little Max into a Big Bad Wolf.<br />I suggest you try this one out.

However, being about the wonderful and enthralling series that has captivated fans since it first aired in the late sixties, the book helps those of us struggling to understand the program by offering a new perspective on it.<br />Essentially, the book is a college-level text that deconstructs the famous television series, and puts it in context with the issues of society both at the time in which the show was made, and today.<br />Many references from the text of the show, both intentional and implied, are examined by author Gregory and distilled down in an attempt to find and understand the many messages contained in the series, the motivations behind the construction of &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, and how the text of the show relates to us in the modern-day, post-sixties world.<br />If you're looking for a fun picture book or pop reference book full of TV trivia, you may be very disappointed with this particular purchase. However, if you want a collegiate text that breaks down and scrutinizes the societial and cultural elements that make up &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, then this is an excellent resource.<br />Be seeing you!	2002-05-19
US	51740838	R3KP8T0E722HKN	0615112315	789148253	Fitting Them Together	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Interesting attempt at New Media	This is an odd little item. It comes on two CD-ROM discs, and has about 70 paintings and poems that play out on the computer screen using a Quick-Time media player (a version is included on the first disc if you don't have it on your computer).<br />A painting will pop up on the screen, then shrink while text pops up next to it, and a person then reads an associated poem to you in a voiceover. The readers are of different ages, nationalities, and experience. Some do not exactly measure up to the best traditions of oral interpretation, but others are a joy to hear. There is one reader in particular who easily outclassed his fellow performers, reading in a deep, accented voice similar to that of Peter Brock (\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\"). One poem he reads about the \\"coats\\" people wear is easily one of the best in the set. Another reader with a (Jamaican?) accent complements her selections nicely.<br />On the down side, frankly, I found the interface to be a bit clunky. Once a poem & painting play out for you, you click on an arrow to proceed to the next one. If, like me, you're used to just hitting the \\"Enter\\" or \\"Return\\" button instead of clicking, the system pretty much quits on you. You'll get an annoying message that pops up and says the \\"disc is locked\\" and then you're stuck and have to start over. Also, the paintings look a bit solarized or pixelized, which may have been on purpose, but I think not. Of course, I use Windows XP, which probably doesn't help matters much.<br />Otherwise, this is a really interesting presentation. I like the attempt, and perhaps a \\"revised edition\\" will use a better interface. Is it great art? Well, that's in the eye of the beholder. I personally did not think it was a pretentious \\"art\\" project, for actual talent was shown. If not great art, then I believe at least it was competent art, and therefore worth a look.	2002-05-16

As my fellow reviewer mentioned, the title of this book is a bit misleading (albeit unintentionally misleading). However, the book can still be an invaluable resource for those interested in woking in the picture book field.<br />While not a guidebook or \\"how to\\" manual, \\"Children's Book Illustration & Design II\\" does give an informative overview of various styles established illustrators have used with their children's book projects. As such, the book can be a useful tool for the novice commercial/picture book illustrator who may need inspiration when faced with a particular assignment.<br />Like a set of picture files on various topics, books such as this one are very handy to have in the artist's studio.	2002-05-16

This is one of those children's picture books that doesn't quite fit a given, standardized genre. In many ways, it bucks the trends, refuses to be pigeonholed, and is a departure from the norm.<br />While \\"The Eyes of Grey Wolf\\" is indeed supposed to be a children's book, it defies description and genre in such unique ways as to make it fit for any age group. Best of all, the story is guaranteed to stay with you, despite taking up only thirty pages.<br />Written in a short, to-the-point, and almost poetic prose style that conjures up Native American folk tales, the book is equal parts kids book and adult literature. And the paintings? Absolutely glorious in their realistic depiction of Gray Wolf's adventure on a snowy, moonlit night. The effect of combining both the stylized writing and luminous art is an almost magical tale that could have come from Native legends.<br />Included at the end is a page or two with factual information on wolves, and contact information for some wolf conservation groups. Overall, an excellent book for any youngster's report on wolves, endangered species, or the environment.<br />The book is relatively short, but do not let that dissuade you from purchasing it. Once you've read it, you'll be glad to have \\"The Eyes of Grey Wolf\\" in your collection.<br />To author London and illustrator Van Zyle, I say thank you for putting this project together.	2002-05-14

The stories come from a wide variety of tribes, and each in its own way imparts the idea that Man must learn to live with these creatures and gain wisdom from them.<br />Now, these stories are really interesting, and I think the project has a great deal of merit. Unfortunately, many of the stories seem to be only half-told. Several kind of leave you hanging in a tree, ending abruptly with perhaps less than a sentence to tie the story together. Even kids can tell when things are missing in a story, and after a typical installment in the book, they will undoubtedly pipe up to ask, \\"So... THEN what happened?\\"<br />Deborah Reade's illustrations are the real prize here, and are liberally sprinkled throughout the book. Most are limited to line art, and so they are not as vivid as the cover. The cover art is absolutely gorgeous, and it's a shame the publisher did not embrace the idea of using more color on the inside. Reade's illustrations are so intelligent and well done that they make up in part for the brevity of the stories. If they were given full color treatments like the cover, the book would have been that much better for it.	2002-05-12

Recently, I was working on a project in which I needed images and data on wolves. This purchase was an afterthought, and turned out to be a great little book that offered all of the information I needed. I found it to be quite helpful and intellegent for a kids book, with everything neatly distilled down to basic data.<br />The style is that of a picture book, with lovingly detailed paintings of various breeds of wolves and their daily activities. Roberto Osti has excelled here with the realistic artwork of the animals and their habitat.<br />The book covers just about everything you'd want to know about the basics in a sort of FAQ of wolf questions and answers.<br />Although the reading level is listed as 4-8 years old, this is not exactly the best book for pre-schoolers. Some younger children may be upset by realistic depictions of wolves chasing and munching on bunny rabbits. For the older reader (say, 7-8 years old), this should be just fine should they develop an interest in these fascinating creatures.	2002-05-12

This is one of two titles by Elizabeth Hough Sechrist that I have always treasured (the other being \\"Heigh-Ho for Hallowe'en!\\" which is sadly still out of print). I first found her work, appropriately enough, when I was a child. Several of her books about holidays were in our children's library at school, and they were that type of book which I had to check out again and again because they were so interesting.<br />This title, \\"It's Time for Thanksgiving\\" offers up a wide range of stories, poems, and plays centered on the theme of Thanksgiving. Guy Fry's fun illustrations are sprinkled throughout the book, and never fail to bring a smile.<br />There is a story of young people in pioneer days preparing the Thanksgiving feast while their parents are not at home, and they have visitors drop by who they have been taught to fear; Indian visitors (I know the term isn't PC, but the book is very respectful, otherwise)! Another tale revolves around children charged with making pumpkin pies, but a simple miscommunication leads to more pies than they can handle! A boy's pet goose is slated for the chopping block and Thanksgiving dinner, until fate intervenes. And a fun play has a little boy who overeats on Turkey Day put on trial by food!<br />The stories are rich and imaginative, always fun and simple. The tales have the definite feel of the mid-fifties, which in my humble opinion make them so much better than the types of things served up and force-fed to kids today. You just knew that Ms. Sechrist and her co-author, Jannette Woolsey, really loved and understood the world of children and the excitement of holidays, and her work (unlike commercialized junk like \\"Barney\\"), was not just an excuse to mass-market toys.<br />Coming back into print after all these years! Let us hope more of Elizabeth Hough Sechrist's work will be made available once again! Hurrah, Omnigraphics!	2002-05-01

This is another fun murder mystery set in the \\"proper\\" society of Victorian Boston's elite.<br />While the first novel, \\"The Death of Colonel Mann\\", leaned a bit more heavily on a Sherlock Holmes formula (Ames and Dr. MacKenzie are practically stand-ins for Holmes and Watson in that book, right down to the Doctor's bad knee), this installment expands the characters a bit more. While still a bit Holmesian, there is less likeness between Homes and Watson and Peale's heroes in \\"Murder at Bertram's Bower\\".<br />One annoying detail is that there was a decidely feminist slant in this book, with constant references to the unfairness of having to wear corsets and whatnot. That, coupled with the topic of \\"fallen\\" women, and the book could have easily veered off into a feminist manifesto. Fortunately, Peale seems to know just when to pull back from the soapbox and get back to the story, and thereby avoid any heavy-handed preaching.<br />Other than this very minor annoyance, the book hits the spot. Victorian Boston really comes alive under Peale's nurturing. The author has again created a very strong sense of place and time, attitudes of the day, social prejudices, and other telling facets of Victoian Boston.<br />The addition of a Jack the Ripper mystery helps drive the story, and raises interesting questions as to whether or not the Ripper is at large and operating in Boston (or if he escaped to America in real life). Inspector Crippen, is, of course, way out of his league, and even welcomes the help of the brilliant but interefering Ames.<br />The climax is a real thriller, as the Bower killer stalks Caroline. I won't spoil anything for you, but I at least was surprised by the identity of the killer. I suppose it was rather obvious, as other reviewers have mentioned, but I for one did not catch it until I was suppossed to.<br />I look forward to reading the next book in the series, \\"The White Crow\\", as well as the fourth, which Ms. Peale is currently working on.	2002-04-17

Like the two other volumes before it (\\"Star Trek Memories\\" and \\"Star Trek Movie Memories\\"), the third installment in the Shatner Chronicles is informing, intriguing, and funny.<br />Shatner and co-author Chris Kreski have painted a picture that may or may not truly reflect Shatner's views or life events, but is entertaining nevertheless. However, I did think it interesting that Shatner seemed open to teasing himself about his ego, his hamminess, his lack of technical abilities, and his reported stubborn arrogance.<br />The history of Trek conventions is very well told, and is an insightful look into the early days of Trek fandom, and what motivated fans to go to a convention in the days before corporate marketeering took control of such fan gatherings. Also recounted is the true, behind-the-scenes tale of the famous letter-writing campaign that saved Trek from cancellation after its second season, as well as the story behind the infamous skit on \\"Saturday Night Live\\" from which the book takes its title.<br />Shatner tells several funny tales that (suppossedly) really happened in his life, that remind one of a humorous disaster in which Kirk deadpans a \\"Why me?\\" through the hilariaous moment before the commercial break (such as being buried in tribbles). In one such story, Shatner tells the tale of being on a Greek isle, miles away from civilization, and seeing a Trek slogan scratched on a ruined Greek edifice: \\"Star Trek Lives!\\" True or not, the humor is fun.<br />Shatner comes off as a good guy and a straight shooter, which is no big surprise (it is, after all, his book, written from his point of view). Still, one telling moment has to be when Shatner discusses how fans are being duped by unscrupulous dealers who trade in fake autographs. Shatner and his interviewees rail against the practice, and rightfully so. However, I felt there was more than altuism behind the actor's outrage. Little mentioned is the fact that Shatner takes a cut from the \\"official\\" autograph salesmen.<br />I also had to wonder why De Kelley was not interviewed for the book, or even mentioned all that much. Nimoy, Takei, and even the actors on other Treks have a say here about conventions or just fans in general, but not Kelley. He passed about the time the book was released, and even so, his perspective as the third corner of the \\"triad\\" of Kirk, Spock and McCoy was sorely missed. If he could not give a direct interview, surely Shatner could have at least recounted a tale of Kelley's reaction to a Trek convention or the fans. Reportedly, Kelley spoke with Nimoy on the phone a while before his death, and the topic of Trek's popularity was something they discussed (De summed it up as, \\"Y'know? We were good!\\"). Yet, Kelley is not featured in the book at all.<br />In any case, the book is a fun read for the history aspect alone, and some of the interviews are interesting as well. Trek fans will appreciate the effort, and hearing about some of the most common questions fans have, why they dress up as Trek characters and aliens, and other revelations about Shatner's encounters with Trek fandom on the convention circuit.aph salesmen.<br />I also had to wonder why De Kelley was not interviewed for the book, or even mentioned all that much.

What a joy to see that my all-time favorite science fiction program, \\"Space: 1999\\", is enjoying a well-deserved renaissance.<br />\\"Alien Seed\\" is a reprint from an original \\"Space: 1999\\" novel issued back in the '70s, which focuses squarely on Year One of the series. While the book doesn't deal with quite the level of existential metaphysics of Year One, it it an enjoyable read, nonetheless. The action and settings are vivid, and the mystery surrounding the alien seed is finely crafted.<br />Best of all, the characterizations are right on the money. You really feel that you're on Moonbase Alpha, trying to solve a dangerous, life-threatening puzzle right alongside your Year One heroes; Commander John Koenig, Dr. Helena Russell, Prof. Victor Bergman, Sandra, Paul, Alan, Mathias, and Kano. The key to this is the believability of the dialogue for each character. You can almost hear the actors reading the lines in your head as you follow the story, but that isn't all. You might also hear a strain or two of Barry Gray's music, the unique warble of stun gun fire, the quiet beeping of Main Mission control consoles, and the distinctive sound of an Eagle lifting off from the pad. At that point, you know E.C. Tubb was doing something right.<br />While this is a relatively short book, it could be the feeling of brevity is due in part to the rapid, page-turning excitement of returning to Moonbase Alpha after all too many years.	2002-04-04

From the classic &quot;R-O-L-A-I-D-S Spells Relief&quot;  PR campaign to the Exxon Valdez PR disaster, each accounting is explained  and with the pros and cons of how the PR was handled, and what should or  should not have been the course of action.<br />Seitel also looks at political  PR, the history of the profession, different types of PR campaigns, and  other important facets of the PR world.<br />This is an excellent reference  for the student, and should be on his bookshelf long after he has an office  in the PR Department.	2000-08-31

It tells the history of the Heinz  ketchup empire, and offers up a serving of interesting facts and figures  about the amazing condiment.<br />For example, in order to get ketchup out of  a new bottle, most people pound on the bottom or use a butter knife. Both  methods are inferior compared with the advice of the Heinz ketchup wizards.  They say the &quot;sweet spot&quot; on the bottle to tap is on the neck,  right where the &quot;57&quot; label is. And it really works!<br />Another  fact is that there are not now or ever were really &quot;57 varieties&quot;  of Heinz condiment products.<br />Though biased in favor of Heinz (who  cares--it's about KETCHUP!), the book is a fun read.

There is one story for each of the  thirteen American colonies, with some focus or other on the local points of  interest in a given colony somewhere between 1760 and 1778.<br />The hero is  Captain Jeremy Cork, a larger than life gentleman adventurer, who is famous  for two things; a mixed alcoholic beverage known as &quot;Apple  Knock&quot;, and his interest in what he calls &quot;social puzzles&quot;  (crimes).<br />The Captain's long-suffering financial yeoman fills the role of  Watson, by accompanying Captain Cork on his cases and narrating the tales.<br />Both characters are pretty much Sherlock and Watson, except they are  both a bit more flamboyant and colorful. They play off each other well, as  Cork annoys his friend with a complete disinterest in business (in fact,  Cork owns a ship that transports goods all around the ports of the  Colonies, yet he himself never sails in it), while his friend hates the  bother of social puzzles (yet accompanies Cork anyway to find out what  happens and to offer what help he can).<br />The stories are entertaining,  and the idea of a Colonial Sherlock Holmes is pretty interesting. The book  even contains the recipes for the Captain's Summer and Winter versions of  Apple Knock (though the author gives the disclaimer it is just for  reference!).	2000-08-23

The paper the book is printed on has a very expensive feel,<br />like soft vellum.<br />In addition, the text has an old-time Colonial<br />days look about it, as if the letters were written with a quill pen!<br />The font is not hard to read at all, but if you look closely, you will<br />see slight irregularities that remind one of words written with the<br />old Colonial writing implement. The old-style production and printing<br />compliments the focus of the story, putting the reader even more into<br />the history being presented.<br />The story surrounds the days following<br />the battles of Concord and Lexington, and the subsequent signing of<br />the Declaration of Independence.<br />The story begins with a wide range<br />of characters in a small North Carolina town. Local politics, debates,<br />and the general reaction to events are well written, with attention to<br />period detail.<br />The Jack of &quot;Jack's Resolve&quot; is a courier<br />who is charged with bringing his local government's dispatchs to the<br />Continental Congress, and his travels are the focus of the second half<br />of the book.<br />I give the book only four stars because I found the<br />cast somewhat confusing. Some characters are refered to by more than<br />one name or title, and it occasionally mixed me up as to who was<br />who. This may be tough reading for high school level students, but is<br />certainly suitable for college-level readers interested in<br />Revolutionary War/Colonial politics and related events.<br />For the<br />price, I doubt you will find a better quality printing.

If the youngster enjoyed reading a  classic in class, the book will point him towards other works and authors  he may like.<br />Each author is profiled with a brief history, a quote by or  about the author, a list of their works, and even a suggestion on which  book is best to start with if you want to, say, read all of Melville's  works.<br />Both classic and contemporary authors are profiled, all in  alphabetical order. The selections are very good, and I did not detect any  major omissions (of course, I'm not an English Lit professor or  anything).<br />Selected authors include Dickens, Tolkien, Salinger, Melville,  Tolstoy, Toni Morrison, Garrison Keillor, and many others.<br />An excellent  reference title, and very affordable.

This book was not so interesting as far a the actual murder of the Colonel Mann, as much as it was for the amazing lifelike characters.<br />At first, I found Addington Ames a pale copy of Sherlock Holmes. He's tall, thin, dark  hair. Intersted in the sciences. Doesn't need to work at a real job, though  not quite rich. Only one woman, radiantly beautiful, a figure on the stage  with a dark past (read: Irene Alder), can rouse him from confirmed  bachelorhood. His friend is a doctor, wounded in the leg during military  service far from home, and acts as the physical half of the duo (read: Dr.  John Watson).<br />But I soon began to realize that there was far more to the  book than a Holmes knock-off. Actually, Ames is not as brilliant or well  versed in the sciences as Holmes. In fact, Ames doesn't really care who the  killer is! The doctor is rather more Watson-like than Ames is  Sherlock-like, but he is not a writer or the narrator. And there is also a  sister in the cast, an independent, progressive woman hiding in upper-crust  traditionalist clothing.<br />The characters in this side of Boston are  focused on the horror that social scandal can bring. Enter the blackmailing  bad guy Colonel Mann and his tattle-tale newspaper!<br />Ames must find a  packet of love letters indiscreetly written by a relative, and that is his  sole motivation in the mystery. The murder of Colonel Mann is of no real  importance other than the fact he had the letters and was prepared to print  the gossip. Upon visiting the Colonel's rooms to retrieve the letters, Ames  discovers the murdered Mann. The publicity makes the Ames family somewhat  radioactive around town.<br />The book plays much like the intricate social  world depicted in the BBC miniseries &quot;The Pallisers&quot; or  &quot;Poldark&quot;. Only this book takes us to Boston instead of London.

US	51740838	RTK3BSY32L2LU	0812545222	49269962	Embassy Row: A Mycroft Holmes Novel (Mycroft Holmes Novels)	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Amazingly Doyle-esque treatment...	This book is written so closely to the style of Sir ArthurConan-Doyle that I hope the author will mull over the idea of writinga Sherlock Holmes book.<br />The &quot;voice&quot; of the novel is dead on. It reads very much like Doyle's writing, which helps keep the reader immersed in the time period of the story.<br />Finally we get to learn more of Sherlock's brother, lesser known but more important to England, Her Majesty, and the Admiralty.<br />The intrigue surrounding the treaty with Japan could have actually taken place, if in fact it did not. Quinn Fawcett certainly did his homework concerning the political events and who would gain or lose depending on the fate of the secret treaty.<br />Compare this excellent book with the writing of some of the modern Sherlock Holmes stories, like &quot;The Ice Palace Murders&quot; or &quot;The Haunting of Torre Abbey&quot;. After seeing Holmes and Watson grafted and mis-cast into standard or sub-par mystery stories at the hands of modern writers, &quot;Embassy Row&quot; was a rare treat.<br />While Mycroft's game is more of espionage and intrigue than the &quot;trifles&quot; of Sherlock and his deductive detecting, Mycroft's brilliance is clearly shown, as are the reasons for his importance to the government of England.<br />Guthrie is an interesting character, somewhat Watson-like. He takes on the role of narrator as well as confidential secretary. The author has chosen well to keep the Mycroft series somewhat like the Sherlock Holmes canon in style and tone, but this has not stifled his ability to create something very new and entertaining.<br />This is a wonderful series, and I hope the author will one day favor us with some stories of the better-known brother who resides at 221b Baker Street. He certainly has the &quot;voice&quot; to make a Sherlock Holmes story quite memorable.	2000-05-03

As with any collection of Holmes stories by modern writers, there are bound to be a few clunkers. What impresses me is that, even though a few of the stories are slightly off the mark, the vast majority of the stories are dead on.<br />Only one of the cases, in which  a series of grisly killings are investigated, is not quite in the voice of  Doyle (mostly due to the graphic descriptions). However, this case also  lets Watson shine. Rather than the standard Watsonish &quot;Amazing!&quot;  or &quot;Remarkable, Holmes!&quot; every time Sherlock utters a revelation,  Watson gets to do a little detecting of his own, albeit medical. What I  particularly liked in the story was that Watson is not left to simply  marvel at Holmes, but gets to contribute more than just the use of his  service revolver.<br />The timeline at the end of the book is also helpful in  putting Sherlockia in some sense time-wise. When did Holmes first begin  detecting, when did he stop, when did such-and-such a case occur? All are  nicely laid out.<br />The book is divided into the early years of Holmes'  career, his middle years, and later years. We get to see early cases, and  his final case.<br />The choices of stories by the editor are first rate. This  is easily the best collection of new Holmes you're likely to find on the  market.<br />The voice of the Master can be heard throughout the book!	2000-04-30

At first blush, this book has it all. Not only did the author do<br />copious amounts of research, but the very concept of a grand winter<br />&quot;palace&quot; constructed of ice is very intriguing. There is a<br />bizzare killing, worthy of Holmes and Watson, and even a radically<br />different location in which the &quot;Deductive Duo&quot; can be put<br />to the test.<br />With all the book has going for it, the wonder for me<br />is that the book goes nowhere at all.<br />Sadly, for all the wonderful<br />research the author has made into 19th Century St. Paul, ice palace<br />construction, and even a year in which Holmes would be available to<br />take the case, the book just does not deliver.<br />Not only is the<br />&quot;voice&quot; off the mark, but the process of investigation is<br />muddled at best. As with many modern versions of Holmes and Watson,<br />the &quot;voice&quot; is obviously present-day. In addition, writing<br />true Holmesian deduction is harder than adding lots of action and a<br />few trifling theories which are meant to pass for the great<br />detective's abilities.<br />In this book, Holmes is constantly at the<br />mercy of events, as opposed to being able to define, predict, and even<br />control events. There is also little or no evidence of the classic<br />Holmes methodology.<br />Holmes stories work best when the evidence is<br />right there in plain sight. However, where we (through Watson), can<br />see the stain on the carpet, the strand of hair, the placement of<br />furniture, the remains of cigar ash, and so on, only Holmes can put<br />the puzzle together because he has observed the importance of the<br />trivial.<br />In this book, all of the evidence is gathered by proxy; a<br />telegram, a letter, a courier, a phone call, whatever. Holmes does<br />little or no actual investigating or deducting, and what there is is<br />rather mundane.<br />The book has good action sequences, but the<br />&quot;duductions&quot; are really more of a point by point recap of a<br />given action sequence.<br />The Shadwell Rafferty character is okay, but<br />I wonder why the author simply did not do a series based on him rather<br />than Holmes and Watson. It would have made more sense, given the<br />author's obvious love for historic St. Paul.<br />There have been three<br />books (so far), in which the author spirits Holmes and Watson away<br />from the fog-enshrouded streets of Victorian London to Minnesota. One<br />or two trips I could see, but a whole series strains credibility for<br />me. After all, it isn't as if a trip from England to Minnesota was<br />particularly quick and easy in 1896, even compared with just a trip to<br />the harbors of New York or Boston.<br />The book also goes on way too<br />long, as if the author was simply did not want the story to end.  The<br />ending is far too drawn out, and Holmes (not to give away anything),<br />gives a detailed account of the killer's actions without any regard to<br />one of the characters who will be most impacted by the grisly<br />details. And that character is seemingly not affected at all!<br />I am<br />not sorry I took the time, but I'm not looking forward to the other<br />two Holmes books by this author. All in all, I would say this was a<br />good read, but not great.<br />Perhaps the author's next effort would be<br />better spent on a Shadwell Rafferty series, now that he has<br />established the character.

I am not altogether sure why this book has received theaccolades it has. While certainly not a horrible or wasted effort, andalthough it thankfully does not stray into non-Holmes territory (likeHolmes having a wife, or that sort of thing), the book just didn't do it for me.<br />As with many new Holmes stories, the &quot;voice&quot; of this book is too obviously set in the present day, rather than the turn of the century. Little things jar the reader out of the late 1800's. An English Lord telling the background history of a child born out of wedlock says &quot;what horrible creatures we men can be,&quot; This does not strike me as a late 19th Century male perspective. While I can't totally disagree with the sentiment, it makes the story momentarily sound modern. While superior to Larry Millet's &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Ice Palace Murders&quot;, the very same problem with the &quot;voice&quot; of that title shows itself here.<br />Also, like that book, Holmes is almost entirely at the mercy of events, as opposed to being able to define, predict, or control them. He runs around a lot, but that's about all. At least there are better examples of Holmes brand of deductive reasoning in Bugge's book.<br />The character of Holmes is much more defined here, and Bugge deserves credit for that. Even so, his character still seems rather off the mark, even more &quot;touchy-feely&quot; than you may be used to.<br />Another problem with this book is the constant abuse heaped upon poor old Watson! He's knocked out, he's deathly ill, he's falling off horses, and seemingly doomed to whatever disaster can be imagined. Why, I half expected he would accidentally shoot himself with his trusty service revolver!<br />The identity of the villain will be obvious to anyone who has read any Sherlockia with even a mild detachment. It was certainly no surprise to me, and I don't consider myself to be a master of Holmes and Watson lore, or Holmes' methods.<br />The book is okay, and kept me reading, but it is hardly an eclipse of the Master. If you want a present-day take on Sherlock Holmes, than this book will fit the bill. If you want an approach more akin to Doyle, you will no doubt find this book &quot;nettlesome&quot; to say the least.me reading, but it is hardly an eclipse of the Master.

This is a thoroughly entertaining story, allowing us into the mind of Charles Dickens.<br />I honestly do not know if the events depicted in the book are historically accurate, but after reading the story I know two  things; one, I don't care if the story is accurate, and two, I was moved  enough to want to find out if it was.<br />For a first novel, this is a real  winner. The author clearly establishes the personality of Dickens, and his  emotions. I felt quite honestly as if we had a window through which we  could view his thinking.<br />The book shows good research has been made, and  although charming and pleasant, it does not shy from the harsh reality of  the class struggle in Dickensian London. This enhances the personality of  Dickens the author has crafted, and his feelings towards the injustices  heaped upon the poor.<br />The book is nicely laid out, too. The printing has  the look of an old-style novel, even though this is a paperback.<br />The only  thing I would call attention to is the ending, which seemed a little too  quick. I think the ending could have been drawn out a bit further, and  perhaps more fully developed. An afterword about what in the book was fact  or fabrication, as well as a brief outline of the real Dickens' actions  after the period the story takes place, would have been helpful.<br />The  individual steeped in Dickens lore will undoutedly find some elements of  the story &quot;nettlesome&quot;, and an end section such as I suggest  might have mollified them somewhat.<br />However, the reading experience was  quite good, and I highly recommend the book for fans of &quot;A Christmas  Carol&quot; as well as followers of Mr. Dickens.<br />I'm also looking  forward to more work by this author.	2000-04-25

Miss Pickerell has also journeyed to the Arctic,  been aboard a Supertanker, helped fix a weather satellite, experimented  with submarines, geiger counters, and lasers.<br />Fun for all!	2000-03-13

Once I started reading, I simply could not put it down.<br />Gilkerson has created a mesmerizing world, both wonderfully complex and yet awash in simplicity at the same time. Set somewhere in the 16th or 17th Century, there is always a hint of magic somewhere deep, deep beneath the surface of the story.<br />Five children, born at the very same moment into different walks of life in the seafaring town of Port, grow up together, fast friends upon their first meeting, eventually circumnavigating their continent in a vessel they construct themselves.<br />Each has a special talent that when combined with that of their counterparts becomes a force to be reckoned with.<br />They take their names (indeed the only names we know them by), from the maritime talents they show best, regardless of their station in life. Pilot, the master navigator; Flags, the flamboyant thespian and artist; Bosun, the master rigger and sailmaker; Steward, cook and victual supplier, despite his royal heritage; and Crew, who holds everything together.<br />The thrust of the book is that the five heroes are actually one, all different sides of the same personality, and that life evolves in a circle.<br />The author's unique knowledge of sailing craft combined with a wonderful storytelling style add to this charming text. The occasional artwork throughout the book is also quite effective in enhancing the story.<br />Hard to believe this is the author's first foray into fiction. With any luck it will not be his last!<br />This book will certainly find a spot on your bookshelf for your most favorite of stories. You certainly should not pass up &quot;Ultimate Voyage&quot;!	2000-03-06

The term  &quot;broadcasting freedom&quot; is Alan's code-speak for having fun, which  is really what radio is all about for him; just plain fun.<br />The book is  fun, too. It follows Al from his first spark of interest in radio, through  his many adventures in trying to stay on the air with patched together  radio gear that would've been given up on by any other broadcaster.<br />When  it comes to engineering, Scotty has nothing on Al Weiner!<br />Interestingly  enough, the book also serves as a anecdotal history of broadcasting in New  York and Northern Maine in the 70's and 80's.<br />The book's a fun read,  written in a laid back and light style. Everyone from amateur radio  enthusiasts, to the ex-hippie granola crowd, and even hard core conspiracy  nuts will like this book.	2000-02-27

This book is short and simple, but wonderful and imaginative.<br />I can't exactly tell if it is set in the 50s, 60s, or 70's, but it does not seem like a modern-day story. There is a great innocence and magic about it that  isn't readily apparent in a 1990s tale.<br />Jon Muth again proves himself to  be a master watercolorist. He opts or a somewhat cartoony style for the  main characters, fitting for the subject matter and age group of this  story.<br />The story itself brings alive the wonder of a simple rainstorm in  the hot summer days of the City. There is no racial issue, there is no  crime, there is no anything to keep the children (and adults) from being  filled with the joy of a summer shower.<br />I bought this book simply to  sample Mr. Muth's marvelous watercolors, but it is a real treat for those  with youngsters as well.	2000-01-01
