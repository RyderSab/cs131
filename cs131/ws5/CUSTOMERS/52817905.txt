Man, this one just didn't do it for me. Bear in mind, I *like* Reynolds - I devoured \\"Revelation Space,\\" \\"Redemption Ark,\\" even the turgid and unsatisfying \\"Absolution Gap,\\" and was looking forward to seeing what he could do with a slipstream/counterfactual plot. <br /> <br />What have we here? Thin characterization, endless, tension-free chase sequences, and (surprisingly) lotsa pseudoscience. What I liked about Reynold's earlier work was the way he let nanotechnology, exotic-physics propulsion systems, and alien contact produce recognizably human cultural responses - but in \\"Century Rain\\" he's given us a mysterious, ancient \\"hyperweb\\" of wormholes interconnecting star systems throughout the galaxy, and it's the least interesting thing in the book! It barely figures in the plot except as an excuse to get us to and from the alternate history of \\"E2.\\" <br /> <br />I dunno, man. Baxter's Manifold books did this better. Hell, even Carl Sagan did it better - and with less mumbo-jumbo around the physics of it. <br /> <br />Worse, Reynolds here commits the fatal error of cuteness. The wildly technophile Slasher culture derives its name and outlook from \\"a certain Web community of the late twentieth century\\" (ack), and there are at least three gratuitous in-jokes turning on famous lines from \\"Casablanca\\" - \\"stick my neck out,\\" \\"beautiful friendship,\\" and \\"Paris.\\" (Don't get me wrong: I adore \\"Casablanca,\\" but this ain't the place to celebrate it.) <br /> <br />In summary: this almost feels like a piece of juvenilia acquired and published after the success of the \\"Revelation Space\\" books. I'm not ready to write Reynolds off just yet, but I'm afraid \\"Century Rain\\" has knocked him off my auto-buy list.	2005-07-05

The sheer wealth and variety of innovative concepts presented makes this an excellent sourcebook for ideas.<br />That said, though, the book surrenders to typographical cuteness, and other design tweaks presumably intended to make it look &quot;Webbier&quot; and more contemporary. To precisely this degree, its utility is limited: the essays seem more like graphics than anything actually intended to be read, and the format makes comparing and contrasting the included projects a challenge at best.<br />Finally, and most problematically to me, &quot;Xtreme&quot; presents a work like Michael Rakowitz's &quot;paraSITES&quot; - emergency, ad hoc homeless shelters intended, I believe, as agitprop and protest - alongside works of conventional, client-driven High Architecture. It has the effect, intentional or not, of trivializing and de-contextualizing everything Rakowitz was trying to achieve, almost as if homelessness was one more glamorous lifestyle choice for the new global nomad.<br />Oh well. Buy the book, and have your own arguments with it. It's challenging to find material on most of these projects in dead-tree format - I've tried, believe me - so in that respect at least, Smith and Topham have done us all a favor.	2002-12-15

This means that it gives as much attention to the optimal design of some frankly squamous-lookin' load-bearing and stress-distributing structures as it does to the (largely post-Deleuzian) theory underlying this work.<br />Up until now, most of the reference materials commonly available on the topic have contented themselves with providing pretty pictures of next-generation architectural blobjects - all skin and no interior - so I'm grateful that someone is finally wrestling with (some of) the practicalities. (And if you just have to talk High Theory, there's no better guide than the brilliant, insightful, and reasonably accessible Manuel deLanda.)<br />I just wish Rahim could have done it without resorting to (or permitting the other authors in this volume to indulge in) the usual jargon-choked theoryspeak. I mean, come on: &quot;dynamic structuration of mobile relations&quot;? This material is sufficiently important that there shouldn't be any need to pump it up with jargon to make it impressive.<br />Worth buying, worth working with, but not for the faint of heart.

(Reading this had a double impact on me, riding a train as I was from the beach town of Shimoda back into Tokyo, and wondering what in the world all those thousands of concrete tetrapods were for...)<br />Kerr has earned his chops, having spent some thirty-five years of his life in Japan - experience which fuels a broadbased and devastating analysis of how, in those years, Japan has abandoned and betrayed many of its own most-cherished traditions (respect for nature, space, silence, stillness, the charged void) and replaced them with ticky-tacky monuments to greed and shallowness.<br />This is not the sour-grapes whining of the embittered expat. You can sense the deep love and respect Kerr has for the land, and his rage at its betrayal. In this he speaks for tens of thousands of Japanese too mired in the Way Things Are to be able to; if a further tragedy is that we cannot hear their own voices, at least Kerr is an eloquent advocate. <br />He probably could have used a good editor - the book is redundant in places, and a few anecdotes and shifts of voice don't really further his argument - but ifyou love Japan, and especially if you are contemplating moving here, you need to read this book.	2001-07-25

If you can get past the academic tone, you'll find &quot;Order by Accident&quot; a provocative and illuminating read.	2001-07-02

He's a true practitioner of what E.O. Wilson calls &quot;consilience,&quot; and I find his work unfailingly beautiful.<br />&quot;Maeda@Media&quot; is a far more comprehensive introduction to and summary of his work than his earlier &quot;&quot;Design by Numbers.&quot; It is also an exquisitely produced volume, and if it is occasionally self-indulgent (spending 60-odd pages on a graphic that spells out &quot;IT IS CUSTOMARY THAT THE SIDES OF A PAGE BE NEGLECTED IN FAVOR OF ITS FRONT AND BACK&quot; on their edges) - well, I'll forgive that. It's a gorgeous tome.<br />Maeda is doing vital and inspiring work; this book should be a kick in the pants to all those of us who work in any of the disparate fields his work touches upon: only connect.	2001-01-30

He makes points that need to be made, but I worry about any sentence of the form, &quot;*All* Web sites *must*...&quot;<br />There's no way anyone can finish that sentence and have it ring true to me, since the Web is such a hugely multifaceted environment. It's not  - and never has been, at least not since Mosaic 1.0 - a purely informational medium. Neither is it a purely commercial environment. It contains both these elements, along with a strong leaving of emotion and an increasing ability to display aesthetic sophistication.<br />With these thoughts in mind, it's purely irresponsible to *demand* that Web sites be designed solely according to the Taylorist precepts of Nielsen's so-called &quot;practice of simplicity.&quot; Simplicity is a wonderful thing - even an underrated thing - but there are topics on the Web, as in life, that require complexity, even idiosyncrasy. The implied insult in &quot;Designing Web Uability&quot; is that users are dimwitted drones who can't be expected to deal with idiosyncrasy.<br />And while the review-of-a-review below may seem snarky, the guy's got a point. I don't want to sound elitist, but simplicity in practice demands subtlety  - mastery of the sort that generally eludes &quot;Dummies.&quot; This book will *not* make you a Web design professional, and if the below example is any proof, it cannot even teach you the basics of aesthetic balance. Nielsen himself admits as much.<br />Usability is a good thing. It is not a religion. Nielsen loses sight of this, which makes him dangerous; half-competent project managers who take up his cause without ever having designed a Web site themselves are more dangerous still. <br />I think it's time for the anti-Nielsen: a loud, proud statement that design is OK, that users are clever, that Flash can be useful, and that emotion is at least equal to commerce and utility in the life of the Web.	2000-11-07

Why am I here recommending that you do it?<br />Well...because it's worth the long, thorny trudge. You've got to get around some idiosyncratic vocabulary, but that's OK. Because, in fact, *A Thousand Plateaus* presents a credible candidacy for Philosophy for our Time (if you can still believe in that). The concept of the rhizome alone - burrowing, nonhierarchical, endlessly foliating thought - let alone fertile ideas like nomadology or the Body without Organs: once grasped, these are extraordinarily useful figures that can wind up restoring some sense of agency (and subversiveness, and fun) to your intellectual life. They're perfectly suited, especially, to life and work in the age of the deeply rhizomorphic Internet.<br />Remember, you're smart enough to understand this stuff. (I had to keep reminding myself.) Reading with partners or in groups helps, a lot. There really is a *vast* amount of provocative and useful thought in here. Go for it.	2000-10-28

In 1991 I read Erickson's *Tours of the Black Clock*, and came away touched to the core by his reckoning with evil, loss, and the secret history of the Twentieth Century; I felt in finishing the book as if I had been given an incredible gift. He was definitely going to be one to watch.<br />Well, I devoured *Amnesiascope* and *Arc D'X* and *Rubicon Beach*, but despite the appearance of the same tropes (like J.G. Ballard, Erickson obsessively redeploys the same imagery, in his case fractured time, deserted Chinatowns, flooded cities) they didn't bring me off quite the way *Tours* did.<br />Now *Sea* does, again. It's a haunting and beautiful meditation on time, loss, evil, and redemption - call it a scruffier alternate take on DeLillo's *Underworld*, for post-boomers. It's uneven in spots, but it did the work that all great writing is supposed to do: it triggered the simultaneous grief, acceptance, and joy in that acceptance that means you've arrived, at long last, at your own life. You should buy this book.<br />Oh, and: thanks, Steve.	2000-10-06

You'd have to go back to greats like Raymond  Loewy or Norman Bel Geddes to find someone who has so unerringly worked out  a design vocabulary in so many different realms, and he's done it all by  his late 30's. The problem is that he's still waiting for someone to come  along and attempt to challenge that vocabulary in print  - prise it apart  and see what makes it tick. <br />This book, very unfortunately, is not that.  What it is, is an extremely pretty and overpackaged walkthrough of his  major work, and as such it's a joy to leaf through - good to have simply  for putting all these projects together in one place. The real upside of  this is that it enables the casual fan to see for the first time the  seamless and almost-obsessive way Newson uses form: the same shape, here a  chair, there a doorstop.<br />We'll be wrestling with Marc's work for the next  forty years, so there's still time, but I had expected more from this book.	2000-05-22

This book is here to blow that perception out of the water  - to tell for the first time the fascinating story of inflatables: how the  idea emerged from the US military, was baptized by the ludic &quot;instant  city&quot; manifestoes of Archigram, and became bound up in the politics of  the Situationist-inspired street protests of May '68. There aren't quite as  many high-quality images as I'd have liked, and from time to time the book  descends into unwonted theoryspeak, but I know of literally no other  reference on this particular moment - one where optimism, liberation, and  technology fused to suggest possibilities where none had existed before.

I would recommend this guide without hesitation to anyone either interested in the car in the abstract, or actually intending to undertake a restoration. The illustrations are thoughtful, helpful, and (in the case of exterior shots) almost romantically posed; the language is clear throughout; Reynolds does an impeccable job of making the book useful to the non-gearhead enthusiast.

How did this guy get so incredibly good, so young? His meticulously-crafted, ashy-grey midcentury metropolis looms up like  something out of Hopper by way of Pynchon; the central metaphor of upward  mobility - which could be so godawful mawkish - is never handled any less  than deftly; the protagonist wears the weight of her overdetermination  proudly, despite every conceivable undermining. I leave the details to the  intrepid reader, but I've simply got to sing the praises of those stretches  - where Whitehead's characters contemplate \\"the second elevation\\"  that will transfigure the cities and the citizens of the day after tomorrow  - whose sweep and pellucid elegance rival anything in the best science  fiction for sending chills ricocheting up & down my spine. If race  (understood narrowly as the black/white dichotomy) is still & always  the central American dilermma, maximum kudos to Whitehead for finding a new  metaphor with which  to approach it. Buy it, read it, pass it on to those  two or three of your friends you can always trust to really *get* stuff:  this is where 21st century American Literature starts.

I happened across this book in the  &quot;spirituality&quot; section of a chain bookstore which shall remain  nameless, while temporarily assigned to duty at the culturally-benighted  Ft. Bragg, N.C. To my mind it is a paradigmatic example of one of the most  terrifying and pernicious ideas I've ever encountered - the closed-minded,  narrow, fear-driven confusion of &quot;protection&quot; with ignorance.<br />  What is it about this stream of Christianity that so doubts itself and its  truth that it must throw up walls against a wider world? If the Gospel of  Jesus is self-evidently and transcendentally true from the perspective of  its believers, it need fear no competition in the marketplace of lesser  ideas. To want to deprive one's family of access to information is to  express contempt and disrespect for them, and is simultaneously an  admission regarding one's true feelings about the relative robustness or  utility of faith.<br /> Conflating Hinduism or Buddhism with UFO worship,  the Moonies, and the Jonestown cultists, further, is merely ignorant and  insulting.<br /> I wish Christians would be secure and comfortable enough  in their faith that they wouldn't seek to deny the validity of others'  paths to understanding, however flaky they might be.	2000-03-23

That's until I started reading Jack Womack. Not *only* does he write works of lucid and humane beauty (which are  typically if regrettably marketed as genre SF by the same boneheaded quants  who sent PKD to his early grave), but he's the most incisive critic of  English-language-as-annihilator-of-meaning since George Orwell. Read  *Heathern*. Then go get *Elvissey* and *Random Acts*. For a non-SF,  non-Dryco, bitterly funny book, try *Let's Put The Future Behind Us*.  <br />The stuff is *that* good. You'll feel a little sadder and a little wiser  and somehow more hopeful after having read *Heathern*, and you won't have  to have been polluted by &quot;Touched By An Angel.&quot; Verily, if the  whole human race were on trial for its life, Jack Womack is the kind of  writer you'd want to hold up and offer as evidence and argument for  redemption.	2000-02-23

I was thrilled to  find that such a book exists, and happier still to put it to use. I  particularly liked the detailed guides in the rear section, and the overall  sense that minimalism need mean neither a slavish imitation of Ryoan-ji nor  a flat modernist sea of polished granite.  My only caveats are that the  book is riddled with typos and misprints - which is simply unacceptable in  any book, let alone a Monacelli tome that'll set you back $50 - and that  too many of the photographs used to illustrate the projects are recycled  from the front section. And (a quibble really) it would have been nice to  see the project that Larry Ellison decreed for his stately pleasure-dome,  instead of Charles Jencks' soi-disant &quot;chaos&quot; garden, which is  really starting to get overexposed, aside from being a misprision of  contemporary complexity theory.

You have no  idea how annoying it is to read that Sir Norman Foster's lighting system  for the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank (or George Nelson's Storagewall, or  *most* of Ross Lovegrove's oeuvre, and so on...) was  &quot;revolutionary,&quot; and then not get to see it, or what was so  revolutionary about it.<br />2. The book misses obvious, multifaceted rising  talents like Karim Rashid, while devoting overmuch space to, say, Jamie  Reid (much as I love his Sex Pistols work).<br />3. Some of the facts are just  *wrong*. The font cited as OCR-B is, I believe, OCR-A, for just one  example.<br />4. The text has either been translated poorly or written in  English by someone with imperfect command of English idiom. This is OK in a  Kartell catalogue, but not in a book intended for a mass English-speaking  audience. It's clumsy, verging on contemptful (i.e., &quot;They'll be so  busy looking at the pretty pictures they won't notice the text.&quot;)<br />  All that said, this is a beautiful and useful book. It has enhanced my  sense of the evolution and internationality of modern design, shed some  (though not very much) light onto the personalities and motivations of  individual designers, blown me away in places (Noguchi's Nurse radio!) and  provided a valuable transitional reference for me at work, where I must  among other things describe design products in depth on a daily basis. I  *really* liked the equal respect given to categories like fashion and  typography, or designers like Coco Chanel who are not usually thought of as  such, or as so influential. And the timeline at the end of the book is  especially interesting.  This would make a great gift for anyone  interested in industrial design, fashion, graphics, or even  branding/marketing. Let's hope the next edition is even better.	2000-01-14

I think the fault may lie in the series' concept rather than the book per se. While it does sound  many of the right notes - Pawsonian asperity first and foremost - by  restricting the ambit to London, the authors miss out on many of the most  interesting trendlets in this most adaptable style.  It's both pretty  and well-presented, but as a comprehensive statement doesn't entirely  succeed. For a more comprehensive take on *architecture* as opposed to  decor, I'd look at *The Architecture of Minimalism*; for those looking for  a more purely idea-driven sourcebook, I'd check out *Minimum*.	2000-01-10

Twenty-eight years later I get a chill down my spine recalling the detailed, Von Braun-meets-Chesley Bonestell elucidation  of how I &quot;was&quot; heading spaceward. I believed it, too - the rest  of my life, as exciting as it's been in so many ways, has been a bit of a  disappointment by contrast. Seminal and a bit melancholy, too - reality has  been so tawdry ever since.	1999-03-28

There's an amazing quote on the back cover of this book, something along the lines of, &quot;Without obscenity, our cities are dreary places and life is bleak.&quot; And wholeheartedly agreeing - the Disneyfication of  NYC 42nd Street to my mind rips the heart out of the city - I plunge in.  What do I find? Nothing much that's terribly obscene, merely sorta sad and  tawdry. The only thing that seperates it from a technically accomplished  photodocumentation of a fratboy bachelor party is the mild millennial  frisson the [gaijin] reader gets from the Tokyo floating-world setting. The  Kenneth Starrs of the world (and there are lots, wouldn't you know) will  find plenty to gasp at - &quot;Look! She's got his penis in her mouth!  Shocking!&quot;. But for the rest of us, Araki-san and his many imitators  will have to do better if they truly want to save us from our sterilized,  sanitized, thoroughly G-rated future.	1998-12-22

Everything  between these covers is essential Lester, right down to the Romilar habit.  It's all there, all the heart and all the goofiness - his legendarily catty  bitchfests/&quot;interviews&quot; with bleached-out, smacked-out mid-70's  Lou Reed, his endless paeans to &quot;Metal Machine Music,&quot; and the  ruthless honesty with which Lester dissected every hypocrisy in range,  including his own racism and that he found festering in the downtown NYC  postpunk scene circa '79-'80.  Read this with an open heart - I think  you'll find that contemporary pop music criticism is very thin stuff indeed  in comparison. Bangs, you bastard, you are sorely missed.  Greil Marcus  does a spot-on editing job, incidentally, upping the signal-to-noise ratio  substantially. And there's a short story by Bruce Sterling (&quot;Dori  Bangs&quot;) that hits just the right note.	1998-12-11

At 22, she's seven years younger than me; by the time she got to Neuromancer, she found it clichd and hokey. And, oh, how I wished I could have taken her back to 1984, when as a soft &amp; unworldly kid from the suburbs, I plucked the book off a shelf at the Penn bookstore.   Before I had finished the first page, I knew I was in love. It swept my mind clean of sixteen years of accumulated clutter - a massive and total adrenaline dump directly across the blood-brain barrier that I have never entirely gotten over. There was nothing to do for it but finish the book, run away to the city, listen to anarchic noise in furtive dirt-floored West Philly basements, jack into thrilling &amp; illicit lysergic idylls, find a girl with quicksilver mind &amp; combat boots to keep me company...  It's many years later, and OK, so Gibson's cyberspace has been leapfrogged by the considerably tawdrier reality; his characters ring hollow; his tech flakes to the touch like the handles of an old and corroded Chinese butterfly knife. But, as I told my girlfriend (hopefully without sounding too condescending): this is where it began. Whether she knows it or not, she lives in a hotter, faster, smarter, sexier and more dangerous place than she would have without the advent of Neuromancer. This book changed the world.	1998-03-13
