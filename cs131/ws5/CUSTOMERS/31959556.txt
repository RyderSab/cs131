Many times I thought I might give up, but as with the ascent of a great peak, the effort is ultimately given a glowing reward. The novel will echo on through your days, and its intricate plot and finely crafted characters will reverberate in your soul. For me, the themes of love and betrayal struck deeper than the also detailed looks at the battles of Islamists, secularists, leftists, etc, in today's Turkey. One can never have left his hometown and yet empathize with these fine characters.	2005-04-05

These stories are not necessarily his best but they give a flavor of his obsessions with the dark side of the puritanical Victorian soul.

Amazingly bad prose combined with an anemic plot, an unsurprising denouement and fuzzy characters, this book isn't worth the paper it's printed on. It does absolutely nothing to elevate one's understanding of the forces at play that lead to suicide bombings in the Middle East. I had hoped to gain an understanding of those last-minute chaotic thoughts that rush through the mind of someone carrying out such a terrible mission, but this novel was a pure waste of time. Perhaps the worst element? His habit of rhyming within sentences which made me wonder whether his book had received any editorial guidance whatsoever.	2005-04-04

Larimer Mellon did just that at age 37, first going to medical school, then founding a hospital in Deschapelles, Haiti, that is running to this very day. The author does well to follow their project and show how their lives were intertwined by others similarly interested in Albert Schweitzer's ethos. This idea of \\"Reverence for Life\\" has led to the existence, in the middle of poorest rural Haiti, of a thriving band of expatriates, native Haitians, short-term volunteers, and visitors of various sorts dedicated to humanistic ideals.  Hospital Albert Schweitzer lives on, and you can be a part of it if you choose.	2005-04-04

Sadly the time period of the piece, the 1960s, are gone and the entire institution of the general practitioner, complete with house calls and lollipops for the children.  But the questions he asks are searching ones that hinge on the very fundamental human relations that modernity is radically changing.<br /><br />What is a human life worth?  He won't give you any answers, because he trusts you to think about all this for years to come. An exceptional work.	2005-04-04

This was one of the great strengths of the stories, that they were tied together with this theme of loyalty, love, and allegiances betrayed.<br /><br />Yet it also the disparate natures of the protagonists, whether ABCDs in America or penniless charwomen in India, that stimulates us to read on. We want to see what a slender thread of heritage, born to the subcontinent, can lead to in so many places around the world. We do not have to be Indian or even Asian to be proud of how resilient our ancestors were and the ways we are bound to them and our children.	2005-04-04

However, that doesn't stop this book from being a clunker. Having started and stopped several times, I finally got stuck at page 215 and have not had the energy or willpower to go further. His plot is bizarre and the characters arouse little sympathy; the prose does little to propel you on.

But the truth is, this is a stiffeningly good jolt of a novel. He takes the same care with language, ability to juggle comedy with tragedy, eye for bizarre detail from his famous AHWOSG and takes it on the road in a brilliant travelogue that feels authentic. I resisted for much of the book, wanting the author to trip up, but he committed not a false step. With American literature rudderless and amorphous, he carves out an area of light.	2005-04-04

He remains still unknown and unappreciated in the United States. This may be due to the misanthropy and celebration of hedonism that he seeks to provoke with, a combination that sits poorly with Puritanical America. Regardless, his ideas are profound and deal with the soulless harried spiritually-shrivelled lives that Westerners live.<br /><br />Buy all of Houellebecq's books if you want provocation, new ideas, another French filosofer that has come round the bend to shake things up.	2004-09-20

His writing is as precise as ever and his wit is there. But somehow the story line following a naive woman protagonist from childhood to age 100 somehow never gets going. There are interesting side characters, true, but the heroine and her listless and lost son do not spark any empathy or understanding but mostly annoyance at their passiveness. The story does get better as it goes along, but it's not enough to rescue the book.	2004-09-19
