He can sniff out a suspect, track down killers and hunt for clues in the dark. These skills blossomed out of a defect he inherited from his father -- the ability to turn into a werewolf.<br />As Marshall searches for a serial killer, he crosses paths with Megan Sheridan, a genetic researcher who's going to help him figure out his lycanthropic tendencies. She doesn't know he's a shapeshifter, of course, but that doesn't stop her from being drawn to the sexy sleuth.<br />Megan also doesn't know that wolves mate for life.<br />Marshall is everything a romantic hero should be: handsome, intelligent, worldly, wounded and struggling with his inner demons when the love of his life finds him lying in a pool of his own blood. Megan, on the other hand, lacks the strength of her patient. She's afraid of the dark, easily deluded and overwhelmed by everyone around her. Other than her beauty and scientific knowledge, I found it difficult to understand why such an intriguing protagonist would be interested in her.<br />Rebecca York's POV switches are easy-to-follow and allow the reader to understand the motivations of the hero, the heroine, the villain and the cop investigating the string of murders. Her ability to set the scene with sensual descriptions is extraordinary.<br />\\"Killing Moon\\" delves into the scientific basis for werewolves to exist in modern times. It is a fast-paced paranormal that mixes a terrifying plot with a less-than-suspenseful romance.	2003-12-04

She's edited two anthologies -- one of women's poetry, the other of anti-war letters -- and founded the journal, Profemina.<br />Until Nov. 23, 2003, I'd never heard of her.<br />Each year on my birthday, I go out to dinner, see a movie and buy a book of poetry. Finding the book is always my favorite activity. I enter the bookstore and amble over to the poetry shelves. After perusing through my favorites (Rilke, Poe, Gallagher, Frost, Keats, Shelley, Dickinson), I close my eyes and find a spot that feels right. Then I search the spines for a title that interests me. When I find one, I pull it out and flip through its pages, reading snippets of verse and rhyme to see if the words connect with me. The hunt continues until I find a dark jewel.<br />&quot;A Wake for the Living,&quot; Lazic's first book of poetry translated from Serbian to English, was the third title I selected from the shelves this year. Within moments, I knew I needed to own this book.<br />Her writing was blunt, honest and pure. It was clear she understood my thoughts from thousands of miles away.	2003-11-30

To receive bags of letters from adoring fans? The entertainers who live in the public eye know it's a unique existence filled with adoration, disdain and the unending need to balance work and fame.<br />&quot;More Letters to Rollins&quot; by R.K. Overton is a collection of &quot;fan mail&quot; and art allegedly sent to singer/actor/author Henry Rollins. It offers a humorous look at the lives of  celeb-stalkers, whackos, philosophers and various Rollinsonians who want to reach out and connect with the former Black Flag frontman. Overton compiled this sequel to the popular book, &quot;Letters to Rollins,&quot; to give readers even more bizarre and earnest commentary from the masses.<br />Overton notes in the introduction that he's culled these gems from the mailbag to answer the loaded question, &quot;What's Henry really like?&quot; What makes this book so fun to read is the way it answers that question with each entry serving as a humorous character sketch of the fan, and an homage to Rollins's inspiring nature.<br />The fact that Rollins printed this book through his 2.13.61 publishing house shows a wry intelligence that could easily be masked by the imposing facade of fame, muscles and tattoos. Clearly this is someone who knows how to laugh at himself and the world around him.	2002-12-14

Smith has traveled from Australia to Zanzibar, confirming the greatest attempts of skill and persistence the world has ever known. He is the Keeper of Records for \\"The Book of Records,\\" a job that has consumed his life for 14 years.<br />When his miserable boss threatens to fire him, J.J. decides to find the most unique and amazing world-record attempt, and that's exactly when a child's letter arrives telling J.J. of such a feat. The letter claims a man in the Midwest is attempting to eat an entire 747. The kicker is -- he's doing it for love.<br />So J.J. hops the first flight to Superior, Neb., to meet Wally Chubb and the object of his affection, newspaper editor Willa Wyatt. Chubb isn't interested in breaking any records, but he agrees to make the attempt in hopes of winning Willa's heart with the whole world watching.<br />J.J. is an unassuming man, one who is so afraid of love that he's completely thrown himself into his job. He travels the world and sees the most phenomenal things, but he never makes a connection with anyone.<br />Wally is the big lug of every small town, the good man who is completely overlooked. He has loved Willa all his life, and will do anything to win her affections.<br />Willa, however, is a beautiful and determined woman. She has that Diana quality about her -- the thing that drives men to make her their muse -- and yet she's never been unable to find a man to match her heart.<br />Ben Sherwood has put some real heart into this novel. The story's pace zooms faster than a falling star, and its moral is clear without being preachy. While most small town stories drown the reader with extraneous exposition and a homey angle, this book offers a delightfully fresh view of how to achieve \\"happily ever after.\\"<br />\\"The Man Who Ate the 747\\" makes a bold statement with its first sentence: \\"This is the story of the greatest love, ever.\\" Although I had my doubts after such a grandiose claim, Sherwood's sweet romance won my heart within just a few pages.

She is the bastard daughter of an earl who refuses to recognize her as anything other than his ward. When her father marries then dies, Sophie is faced with the addition of an evil stepmother and two wicked stepsisters who immediately turn her into the tortured maid.<br />While there is no fairy godmother bibbitty-bobbitty booing in this romance novel, Sophie does get the opportunity to attend a masquerade ball, and there she meets her prince -- a wealthy member of the ton named Benedict Bridgerton. Thankfully, the story veers off into a more modern direction at this point, and becomes a fabulous tale of love lost and found.<br />For one who is treated so cruelly, Sophie is no victim. She's an independent, intelligent girl who makes her way in the world using only her wits and sensible nature. Though she immediately falls in love with Benedict at the ball, she's levelheaded enough to know they could never be together due to their social ranks, and does what she can to avoid him. This task becomes quite a bit more difficult when he saves her from the evil clutches of her new employer, and then places her in his mother's home because he's simply unable to let her out of his sight.<br />Two years after that ball, Benedict is still haunted by the image of that masked woman. But when he is unable to find her, he resigns himself to a life of boring parties and continuous, familial matchmaking. Then he meets Sophie, and suddenly his world is filled with joy and frustration. He offers to make her his mistress, and cannot understand why she refuses.<br />Julia Quinn knows how to build a romance between two characters from different backgrounds. She creates situations where their worlds collide and then lets nature take its course. Her writing is clean and angel food cake light, and her dialogue skills are flawless. Each conversation embodies the moment, whether it includes witty repartee, dripping venom or lusty pronouncements. The only downside to this book is the ending; after such an intriguing romance, I was sorry to see the prose fall into soap opera melodrama.<br />\\"An Offer From a Gentleman,\\" a Cinderella tale told in Regency fashion, will fill any romantic reader's head with images of masked strangers and love conquering all..

He's brought in for questioning and detained until the police realize they've nabbed the wrong man. With Reacher's aid, the police haul in another suspect -- who promptly confesses to the crime, even though he also didn't do it.<br />More bodies start piling up in this strange, quiet town and a conspiracy is slowly revealed. Though Reacher stopped in Margrave on a whim, it soon becomes clear that he's knee-deep in its rash of vicious murders.<br />Reacher is a cold fellow, lacking much in the personality department. He is methodical and violent when the situation calls for it; the rest of the time, he's simply floating from one dangerous situation to another.<br />The first book in the Jack Reacher series, \\"Killing Floor\\" starts off with a bang, but soon slows to the pace of a hot, muggy Southern morning. The story occasionally picks up speed, but the twists and turns of the mystery are revealed in an erratic fashion.<br />There is a masculine quality to the storytelling style -- few words are wasted on frills or emotions. One love scene happened so fast, I almost missed it. However, once you settle into this novel (about 200 pages in), \\"Killing Floor\\" offers an appealing whodunit with a unique antihero.	2002-05-19

While hanging out at Sean's house one weekend, a car approaches. One of the boys gets in the car and disappears. During the four days he's gone, no one know what the men inside the car did to him, but everyone suspects the worst.<br />Twenty-five years later, their lives cross paths again. Sean is now a homicide detective. Just off of suspension and struggling with the recent failure of his marriage, he throws himself fully into the investigation of a new case -- the murder of Jimmy's daughter Katie.<br />Jimmy's life has been far from easy. He grew up on the fringes, engaging in criminal activities that eventually landed him in prison. But he turned his life around, and was in the process of running a successful corner store and living comfortably with his wife and three daughters when Katie is killed.<br />Dave has also had a bit of trouble. He can't seem to keep his life in order -- his work history is spotty, his drinking is getting worse and for some reason, he can't stop driving by parks and public swimming pools. His marriage seems to be on the rocks until the night he comes home, covered in blood, and announces to his wife that he just killed a mugger.<br />Katie's death would appear to be the central focus point of the story, the thread that links the lives of these three men together. And yet, in truth, their fates were decided long ago, on the day a car rolled up and two men demanded the boys get inside.<br />&quot;Mystic River&quot; is a stand-alone tale with many twists and turns. Since all the clues are clearly presented, attentive readers will surely have the whole plot figured out by page 300. The book separates itself from Dennis Lehane's previous mystery series about two private detectives working in Boston. The pace of<br />&quot;Mystic River&quot; is much slower, and the writing definitely feels more &quot;literary.&quot;<br />Lehane has a knack for pulling the reader into his stories.

In the effort to regain her memory, Faith stumbles on a conspiracy of blackmail, torture and murder.<br />While in her coma, Faith's friend Dinah, an investigative journalist pursuing a mysterious story, disappears. To figure out her connection to the kidnapping, Faith joins forces with Dinah's boyfriend Kane MacGregor and psychic FBI agent Noah Bishop. Together, these three people use Faith's dreams to try and find Dinah before it's too late.<br />The plot of &quot;Hiding in the Shadows&quot; is an intriguing one, but it falters from too many red herrings and an improbable romance. Only once did I gasp in wonder at a twist in the story, a rarity for a Kay Hooper book. It's clear there's a paranormal aspect to this mystery, but it's muddied by improbable decisions.<br />When the villain is revealed, there is no &quot;ah ha&quot; moment, and no real or evil reason for the whole action to have occurred.<br />Faith is just a bit too predictable as a &quot;help me&quot; heroine. She is continuously described as frail and lost, in constant need of being rescued. In fact, she doesn't develop a backbone until the last three chapters, even though Hooper keeps telling the reader how strong Faith really is.<br />Kane, on the other hand, is clearly suffering from the loss of Dinah. He performs ordinary tasks like eating and sleeping by rote as he searches for his lost love. You can feel his agony on every page, which only makes his sudden passion for Faith so annoying. Bishop jumps in and out of the story and feels more like a<br />shadow himself, rather than a character offering anything substantial to solving the mystery.<br />&quot;Hiding in the Shadows&quot; is a quick read, but not a very satisfying one. The ending leaves the reader hungry -- not for more stories with these characters, but for a meatier tale.	2001-10-30

Aimee, a 14-year-old girl living in a small, New York town, has no idea that her life is about to be forever altered. Instead of a jaunt to the mall with her best friend, she is brutalized and almost murdered, then &quot;rescued&quot; by a pedophile.<br />Douglas Prager, a computer technician with a genius grasp of medical imagery, is a 40-year-old man who's in love with Aimee. The highlight of his weekend is to sit in his car and watch Aimee walk by so he can use this image to fuel his improper sexual fantasies. On this Saturday morning, however, he sees Aimee get accosted on the street by two strangers who clearly mean to kill her in broad daylight. In response, Douglas risks his own life to charge in and save her.<br />&quot;Prager's Pattern&quot; is a book of many stories, all entwined into a clear and readable pattern. Hired guns, rats hiding in the witness protection program, the Mafia pulling strings from prison, police officers struggling with stray bullets and an overriding theme of child molestation provide this &quot;chase&quot; story with a surprising amount of depth. The head-hopping is a bit difficult to follow without any clear typographical breaks, but each new point of view sorts itself out within a few sentences.<br />Douglas is a conflicted man, someone who is torn by his own desires for Aimee and the need to save her from the men trying to kill her. Aimee is caught in a web of death that really has nothing to do with her. She is an innocent wearing the face of a &quot;mark,&quot; and her life is completely changed by that fact.<br />John Alvar uses his debut crime novel to break all the genre's boundaries. The hero is a pedophile, and yet the reader can't help but root for him. Sympathy also bursts forth for two professional killers. One is a big lug who hates killing children but does so as part of his job. The other one is hired to clean up everyone's messes, a job he handles with an admirable efficiency.<br />&quot;Prager's Pattern&quot; is a unique story, and a fresh breath of air in a genre that often feels stale with recycled plots and characters.

In preparation, Ida Mae places her heirloom china tea set on the table, puts the water on the stove and even finds a few cookies to share. The scene is set for a relaxing catch-up session between two unlikely pals. But when Jane arrives, she brings tragic news, and Ida Mae's life is never the same.<br />Ida Mae is a woman of her time -- which to the modern reader feels incredibly homespun and old-fashioned. Her personality is offered in snippets of journal entries and first person narratives, which provide a history of broken hearts and haughty relatives.<br />Jane, on the other hand, is flamboyant and fresh. She's an actress with a flair for entrances and exits, but one who hasn't let celebrity cloud her understanding of real friendship. Even her poor decision-making skills are endearing and understandable. However, her decision to enjoy one last tea party with her more steadfast counterpart is a wise one, and gives this tender story a glimpse at the unbreakable bond of their friendship.<br />Ginnie Siena Bivona has a gift for using all the reader's senses. Close your eyes and feel the old South emerge in this tale. Listen for the strains of Billie Holiday coming from the parlor. Feel the warmth of the summer sun on your skin.

Little did she know this new duty was going to be so much trouble.<br />When several wereanimals are kidnapped, including one of her own pard, Anita is forced to jump into the world of shapeshifter politics. In order to save the day, Anita has to cement the connection between her two lovers, master vampire Jean-Claude and Richard, the leader of the local werewolf pack.<br />The plot of &quot;Narcissus in Chains&quot; is very thin. Once the triad of Anita, Richard and Jean-Claude is forever bound, the rest of the story is really just a series of intense bed-hopping. The writing of these scenes is quite sensual, but leads the story into a continuous stream of erotica, rather than the adventurous crime stories of old.<br />Laurell K. Hamilton's characters are so familiar now that avid readers of the series will feel as if they're reading fan fiction. Newer readers, however, should start from the beginning. Though a great deal of background is provided in this book, it serves more as a reminder to the previous books' events.<br />Those new to the series will not understand the nuances of each characters' reactions, particularly Anita's motivations or why she constantly fights everyone around her. Ten books have made her hard, more sexual, definitely sociopathic, but these changes make sense when her history is known and understood. View her from here and Anita takes on a very harsh and promiscuous appearance.<br />&quot;Narcissus in Chains&quot; is a wonderful book of erotica. But since it takes a full 300 pages of sex scenes to even get to the plot, readers eager for more of Anita's horrific adventures will be left cold.	2001-10-30

But all those mind-sessions with the worst humanity has to offer has taken its toll on Cassie, and she decides to retreat to a small town on the East Coast.<br />Cassie inherits her aunt's rural home, and takes up her place as the town loner. No one knows who she is or what she is, until a serial killer decides to make the town his latest target. Unable to sit idly by when she knows she can help, Cassie offers her services to the town sheriff.<br />For the more skeptical reader, Cassie's abilities are explained quite well. She overcomes even the most cynical overtures by continuously putting herself at risk to help others. Although her appearance is a fragile one, this woman is strong and powerful, and utterly determined to do two things -- find the killer before he strikes again and keep herself alone and remote from the rest of the world.<br />Those plans are ultimately complicated by Ben Ryan, the town prosecutor. Ben is one of the few people Cassie is unable to &quot;read,&quot; and that makes her attraction to him that much more difficult. Ben is a typical romance novel hero. He's handsome, kind and troubled (he has &quot;walls&quot;), yet he simply exudes warmth. It's<br />clear the two of them would make a great match, if they can just get past their individual fears...and the whole serial killer situation.<br />Filled with a dozen twists and turns, &quot;Stealing Shadows&quot; keeps the reader entranced. Just when you think you've got the next victim picked out, or the killer identified, Kay Hooper throws another option at you. The characters of this book are memorable and real, the kind you don't want to let go after the story ends. My only suggestion is to avoid reading this book in bed. I guarantee you'll get no sleep at night.	2001-10-30
US	52559846	R3EB6X5GPP04B5	0312265840	198558647	Seven Up (Stephanie Plum, No. 7) (Stephanie Plum Novels)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Hot and Humorous	Stephanie Plum, inept bounty hunter and New Jersey fashionplate, is having trouble nabbing her latest skip. Eddie DeChooch, an elderly criminal suffering from depression, keeps slipping through Plum's grasp. This wouldn't be a huge problem except DeChooch seems to be involved with a cigarette theft ring, the Mob, several kidnappings and murder.<br />In the latest humor/mystery by Janet Evanovich, Plum continues to land in a mess of trouble. Her stoner friends seem to have disappeared. Her mother thinks she's getting married to her sometime-boyfriend, vice-cop Joe Morelli. Two guys keep breaking into her apartment and doing the dishes. And then there's Ranger, a dark and sexy colleague who's offered to help her catch DeChooch, but only if she promises to spend the night with him -- a prospect that's playing hell with her hormones and conscience.<br />Plum has been a bounty hunter in the 'Burg for seven books now, and she seems to become less capable with each story. Her errors place her in harm's way, but these situations never feel truly dangerous. Instead, she bounds from one screwball moment to another, meeting a host of interesting characters along the way.<br />Plum's love triangle between Morelli and Ranger heats up again, and both men seem appealing in their own way. Normally I'd be rooting for Morelli, but in this book, he seems to have become even more Italian than normal; he's constantly urging her to give up her job and just become his wife. Unfortunately, his<br />reasons never seem to include that fact that he's in love with her. Ranger, on the other hand, makes his interests quite clear, he wants her body, and damn if her body doesn't react with the urge to comply.<br />Favorite characters from past books return, including ex-hooker Lula (who has a great scene at a mud wrestling bar) and Grandma Mazur (who is forever peering into caskets at the local funeral parlor). Plum's &quot;perfect&quot; sister from California also makes an appearance, and manages to bring along some interesting antics of her own.<br />The dialogue in &quot;Seven Up&quot; fairly crackles with each exchange, leaving the reader laughing so hard that gasping for air is necessary. The plot is fairly predictable, but the &quot;heart&quot; of the story does add a neat twist near the end.<br />Evanovich has a talent for light-hearted mysteries. Plum is far different from her female contemporaries (such as Sue Grafton's headstrong Kinsey Malone and Patricia Cornwell's tough-as-nails Kay Scarpetta) in that she doesn't always have every situation under control. Readers won't mind though. The change of pace<br />is not only hysterical to read, but offers some much needed, light-hearted fare.to bring along some interesting antics of her own.<br />The dialogue in &quot;Seven Up&quot; fairly crackles with each exchange, leaving the reader laughing so hard that gasping for air is necessary.

Her royal family has this little hang-up about her mixed parentage, and has spent the past three years looking for her. Once they find her, she's dead meat.<br />To avoid being killed, Merry hides out in Los Angeles, using glamour to disguise her appearance. She works as a private detective specializing in supernatural cases. Unfortunately, the first case the reader is exposed to is the very one that exposes Merry to her family. Upon her return to the Unseelie Court, Merry<br />is pushed into an unexpected political situation, one that could affect the future of the Fey.<br />Merry is an interesting character, full of spirit and experience (most of which seems to be sexual and/or violent). Her interaction with the other characters, both human and Fey, is unfortunately lackluster due to the dialogue. It's clear Laurell K. Hamilton wants to show Merry as a witty, intelligent person, but the words that come out of her mouth rarely provide back-up to this contention.<br />However, Merry's guards, Frost and Doyle, are wonderful characters, particularly when shown side by side. They provide an intriguing dynamic of light and dark, and their attitudes toward court politics (of which they've experienced for over 800 years) certainly leave the reader wanting to know more about them.<br />The plot of &quot;A Kiss of Shadows&quot; also leaves something to be desired. In essence, the book is really just a series of sexual situations interspersed with a lot of running. The mystery and horror elements so common in Hamilton's other books are missing from this one, although the encounters between the sheets are certain to leave any reader a bit breathless.<br />Hamilton has a gripping writing style. Her words pound into your brain with staccato drum beats. Though she tends to spend a great deal of time &quot;telling&quot; rather than &quot;showing&quot; the reader what's happening, Hamilton knows how to dig into the latent fantasies of her readers. Her erotic descriptions are breathtaking, and make for some uncomfortable incidents when read in public. Those of a more sexually free nature will revel in her characters' escapades, and enjoy this tense little romp of pleasure and pain.<br />Fans of Hamilton's Anita Blake vampire hunter series should definitely pick up this book, if only to support the author. The story is not the greatest, but it's clear Hamilton intends to lead Merry into her own series. If you've not been exposed to her writing before, skip &quot;A Kiss of Shadows&quot; for now, and read the Anita Blake series instead.

He and his beautiful wife, Julie, are still very much in love after more than 16 years of marriage. Although his daughter Kyra is going through the typical changes of puberty, he adores her. His job as a firefighter is rough, but one he does with the utmost professionalism and care. He is respected and well-liked. Life is good.<br />When Kyra is suddenly murdered, Paul's world turns upside down. The press is hounding his home for quotes. The police are struggling to find the killer. And Paul is doing everything he can just to maintain his sanity in the face of such overwhelming grief.<br />Interspersed with Paul's story are some interesting documents -- the coroner's report on Kyra, background information on fires, even scientific manuals on pain and patience. These tend to break up the pace of the story a bit, while also giving some useful background information.<br />Paul is incredibly compelling. He's a man who deals with life and death on a daily basis, and is completely rocked when Kyra is killed. What he does after his daughter's death, and how he changes, is really the heart of this book. Agree with his actions, or disagree with how he handles his grief -- either way you'll still be forced to continue reading to find out what happens next.<br />Craig Spector's writing is fresh and strong. Other than his annoying habit of leaving foreboding clues at the end of just about every chapter, Spector knows how to pull a reader into his world and sympathize with the characters' actions.<br />&quot;To Bury the Dead&quot; works because of its surprises. It's infused with the fury of grief and the strength of fire, both of which act as wonderful descriptions for the pain a father goes through after losing his daughter in such a violent manner. The writing style is easy to absorb, and seems ideal for a future film adaptation.	2001-10-30

US	52559846	R1JTIC45XA5Z0X	0595093086	372400153	Inherent Consent	Books	2	0	0	N	N	A Medical Thriller	A prominent doctor is pulled from his bed by a knock at the door. He expects to find his mistress eager for a sexy romp; instead he is brutally murdered and framed for crimes he didn't commit. His associate, Dr. Beth Brecker, is the next target. But before the killers can reach her, Beth is warned and escapes.<br />On the run, Beth ends up in a small town in South Carolina. There she attempts to disappear. Doing so takes money, so she applies for a waitressing job at the local diner and begins to acclimate to her temporary, new life.<br />Her very first day on the job, Beth meets a handsome young doctor, a man who will complicate her situation more than she realizes. How can she even think about getting involved with someone, considering how crazy her life is right now? Particularly since the men meant to kill her still plan to finish the job.<br />The characters have many layers -- each one feels and acts just like a normal person. These are not cardboard cutouts, though no one here feels fresh.<br />Stephen Gordin has a firm grasp of the medical aspects of this mystery. He shares the information in a very clinical way, a matter-of-fact manner that's almost chilling. His plotting is a bit jumpy, and he jams way too many storylines into the first 100 pages of the book, which keeps the reader from truly becoming engaged.<br />However, &quot;Inherent Consent&quot; addresses some useful topics -- life and death, blackmail, fraud and the availability of affordable, quality heath care -- and does so in a way that certainly leaves one pondering after the last page is turned.	2001-10-30

I felt bad doing it too since I know it took Neil two years to write it...but how could I help myself? The story was engaging and the writing brilliant. In fact, I plan to read it again this weekend just to make sure I didn't miss anything the first time.<br />Fans of Gaiman's other work will not be disappointed -- this is his largest body of work since The Sandman series. In fact, American Gods may just be the ticket to hooking friends and family members who are too jaded to read comic books.<br />I have a literary pantheon of gods, and Neil is definitely one of the top deities.	2001-06-21

US	52559846	R8HICFRBRUISJ	0743406451	445617977	In Fidelity	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Unable to stop reading...	Dr. Jordan Sloan's life is about to take a left turn. She's having second thoughts about divorcing her cheating husband. Her teenage daughter is immersing herself in a new boyfriend and religion. And the man who murdered her father has just been released from prison.<br />At the same time, Jordan is faced with a troubling new therapy patient. The woman is brazen, sexual, troubled and getting under Jordan's skin in a way only a narcissist can.<br />Jordan is an intriguing character. She's strong, confused and determined to work through her past in order to make her future more tenable. Although it's easy for the reader to connect with her -- the book is written in first person -- Jordan often behaves erratically. She's quite human, but seems to be surrounded by people with absolutely no common sense. In response, Jordan responds to these outside forces with exasperation and sexual fantasy.<br />Jordan's daughter, Lilly, tends to ruin the mood of this book. She's a teenager who's whiny, annoying, brash and completely drugged with her new boyfriend and his Zen beliefs. In response, Jordan indulges her every whim, allowing her to sleep with her older boyfriend and give away thousands of dollars in clothes. The interaction is extremely frustrating.<br />&quot;In Fidelity&quot; was a bit predictable, the plot following the expected twists and turns of an old mystery novel. Still, the writing was absolutely gripping, and I was simply unable to put this book down until all the various threads had been tied.<br />M.J. Rose has a real talent for connecting with her reader. Her writing is visceral, crisp and sensual, filled with the delight of the senses (I know I'll certainly never look at fruit in the same way!). Rose also has a good nose for romantic suspense, one that in time, could make her a leader in the genre. --Reviewed by Jade Walker, Inscriptions Magazine	2000-12-31

Sure enough, it does.<br />Follow Gelman's life as a police reporter during his first year. See how he struggled with the writing involved, the  difficulties of speaking to grieving family members and the unstoppable  effects of crime on society.<br />I read this book on my own in college when I  studied both journalism and criminology. Personally, I think it should be  added to every journalism school's required reading roster. It's full of  useful information and a great read.	2000-04-03
