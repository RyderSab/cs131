US	42357512	R225XKHXLP6RMN	1589780787	941068156	Northern Crown: Gazetteer	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Great supplement	I had some concerns with the main Northern Crown book, but this book alleviated much of it.  This book is very much the DM's guide to the setting.  I liked how it described the possible adventures, environments, and nations of the setting.  The monsters, treasure, magic items, inventions, and NPCs are also well done.  The only problem with these things is maybe trying to do too much.<br /><br />Of particular interest is the Gazetteer chapetr of the book.  I liked how it described all the locales of the setting, and how they modified all the real-life settings to a fantasy setting.  My only problem is the maps.  They tried to make the maps look old and crinkled, but they only succeeded in making the maps undecipherable.  The area of the Five Nations Confederacy looks more like a lake than Lake Ontario.  Is there supposed to be an ocean on the eastern portions of the map; it's hard to tell.<br /><br />Besides the issues with the maps, the reason I'm only giving this  a 4 is that the bibliography needed descriptions, the Cimmarons need to be less dependent on the user also having Nyambe, and the book needed more pages to do all it tried to do.  A very good book, but needed just a bit more.	2005-10-02

After reading, I find the book to have pluses and minuses.<br /><br />Anderson did a fine job trying to condense America from 1600-1805 into a fantasy setting.  He merges items like the English Civil War and Aaron Burr's conspiracy into one whole cloth.  He oversimplifies slavery, saying it was utterly evil, instead of making it a neutral issue like it was in real life and would make for more interesting roleplaying.<br /><br />I do have problems making, essentially, 17 \\"races\\" for humans in the setting.  Yes, there are major differences between Europeans, Natives, and Africans, but to separate each into 17 was just too clunky.  It would have been better to simply do what the Forgotten Realms does with Regional Feats.  That said, I did like the lengthy descriptions for \\"Uropans\\" and \\"First Ones\\".<br /><br />Second, the classes.  For some reason Anderson believes that barbarians, fighters, monks, rangers, and rogues have no place in \\"Northern Crown\\".  I can see not having monks, but the rest?  Backwoodsmen and Indians could easily be barbarians.  Fighters and rogues are found no matter the culture.  Why keep paladins but not rangers in a setting where the wilderness and magic are marque; this is a ranger's dream setting.  New classes like rake, soldier, and scout are just poor-man's versions of classes eliminated.  I liked the prestige classes, especially the sower (think Johnny Appleseed) and Firebrand (although I do believe they should be allowed every alignment except True Neutral).  However, the Tall Tale Hero was utterly cheesy.<br /><br />The book completes itself nicely, with the normal rules describing skill use, new feats, and new spells.  The equipment list is nice.  I also liked the fact that they mentioned psionics.<br /><br />All in total, the book isn't bad, but there were too many ill-thought ideas within this book.  Therefore, a 3 it is.  There is good stuff in here, but a DM needs to edit it.book.  Therefore, a 3 it is.  There is good stuff in here, but a DM needs to edit it.	2005-09-29

He does a fine job of cataloging as many scenic views as possible within the Hoosier state.  The addition of 16 full-color pages was excellent, although the photos do not do the views justice.<br /><br />The problem is that he added TOO MANY areas to his book.  By adding so much he detracted from the true diamonds of Indiana.  Yes, they are all great, you dilute the truly magnificient.  Also, while Trogdon is a solid author, his writing is not as gripping as a Bill Bryson's is.<br /><br />If you are a Hoosier and love your state, you will not mind adding this to your collection.  if you are not a native to Indiana, this book isn't going to rev up your interest in this of most magnificient states.	2005-09-25

Before he laid out the 100, he listed a few generalized groups of people who are screwing up America.  Then he goes into the 100.<br /><br />For those who says it is nothing but hard-right spiel, then how do you explain both Judge Roy Moore (who decided to go against court orders in order to keep a Ten Commandments monument in Alabama) and Michael Savage on the list.  Goldberg also added people who in no way are connected to the political debate, such as Michael Jackson.<br /><br />I just wish he chose to be more consistant in his book.  In most entries he reports the, shall we say, \\"transgressions\\" that caused someone to be on the list in a reporter/scholarly manner.  However, for Michael Jackson he simply puts \\"you know why\\" and for Al Franklin he does a fake interview with Al that, while perfectly demostrating what Al Franklin does, tends to distract from the whole.<br /><br />Whether or not this is an \\"enemies list\\" or not, it does illustrate why some people are supposedly \\"disrespected\\", making it more useful than a \\"Criticism\\" subhead for Wilkepedia.	2005-07-06

The book features several incredible insights to the Japanese mind of the 1950's, including how the Japanese actually saw Hirohito, the new police and judicial system, the food America imported to feed the Japanese, and how the Japan initially started to recover.  kawai believed that the occupation succeeded due to Japanese traditional pragmatism, a pragmatism whose temporary dismissal brought fourth WW2, in Kawai's mind.<br /><br />This book is made relevant for today's scholar by comparing the events of America's attempts at \\"nation-building\\" in 1945 Japan to America's \\"nation-building\\" of Iraq in 2005.  We had finished the fighting in Japan, but have not yet done so in Iraq.  The United States was woefully ignorant to the nutrition necessities of Japan, but knew exactly what to do in Iraq.  In both places the American overseers were exceedingly careful about who would govern the country.  Perhaps most importantly, we can learn from Kawai's slight pessimism on 1960 Japan, and what it is like today, and remember it as an object lesson whenever one feels pessimistic on what is currently happening in Iraq, or even Afghanistan.<br /><br />In conclusion, Japan's American Interlude proved to be a very informative and valuable book for learning more about Japanese culture and the immediate aftermath of World War II.  It is well-written, and full of information on what happened during America's occupation of Japan,  The reader just has to remember that any pessimistic conclusions Kawai made when writing this book in 1960 are mostly disproved by time, not because Kawai did not know his subject.  He just needed a crystal ball, or at least optimism, to truly stand out for the modern reader.  That is the only sad thing about this work.tal ball, or at least optimism, to truly stand out for the modern reader.  That is the only sad thing about this work.	2005-06-08

This edition of Werewolf does try to be more streamlined, although the way they did Gifts (which reminded me of D&D/d20 domains) was overly complicated.  The revision will definitely help those veteran Vampire and Mage players who wanted a sourcebook for Werewolves.<br /><br />However, this book is not for those who played Werewolf: the Apocalypse. For starters, there are only 5 tribes instead of 13.  Unlike the new Vampire, where they tried to keep old Vampire tribe names, they did not bother with this.  They simply renamed Get of Fenris (Blood Talons), Uktena (Bone Shadows), and Glasswalkers (Iron Masters). The other two tribes for PCs are a Red Talon/Bone Gnawer cross (Hunters in Darkness) and a Shadow Lord/Silver Fang cross (Storm Lords).  The only bright spot is that they gave werewolves their own Hollow Ones (Ghost Wolves).  The Gifts are far rigider than they needed to be; the Apocalypse Gifts were right on.  The enemies (\\"Pure\\" Werewolves and spirits) are lacking the depth that the Wyrm and Pentex gave.  Apocalypse had an overreaching goal; Forsaken simply tells the Werewolf player to either hunt bad werewolves and spirits or be hunted by them). The only real addition for veteran Werewolf players is the ability to create custom totems.<br /><br />To put it bluntly, for those WoD players who haven't played Werewolves before, the book is a 4-5.  For veteran Werewlf players, it's a 1-2.  Averaging it out makes it a 3.	2005-04-25
US	42357512	R2OFM6NQANVSGZ	0871950642	613590460	Indiana Quakers Confront the Civil War	Books	4	7	8	N	N	A nice addition to American historical work	The book Indiana Quakers confront the Civil War looks into how Quakers within the state of Indiana dealt with the Civil War.  This is obvious.  But what is not obvious is what the author, Jacquelyn Nelson, investigates.  While Quakers are generally pacifists, many Quakers actively supported the war, up to and including becoming soldiers for the Union Army.  How Quakers dealt with their fellow Quakers getting so involved with the War is also covered.  I think the author did a good job covering the subject, but she seemed determine to repeat herself throughout the book, as if she was deliberately writing just to increase the page count.<br /><br /> On the subject of Indiana Quakers, the books divides the chapters as Quaker Background, Quaker Military Service, Why the Quakers Fought, How the Quakers Dealt with Army Life, the Home Front, and Opposition to the War.  She mostly worked with examples, although she did include a few narratives, mostly as an appendix to the book.  In fact, the appendixes are more than half of the book, as it includes primary sources as well as brief biographies of each Quaker found to serve in the War.  There was no problem with the content within the book.<br /><br /> The book offers an interesting thesis: that Quakers were not entirely pacifistic during the Civil War and in fact, many actively participated in the War as the evidence of the Indiana Quakers shows.  The author believes that most have overlooked the Quakers in Civil War study due to the fact that Quakers are such known pacifists that most historians simply concluded that the Quakers were not involved in the War so there was no need to study their actions during the War.  This is a significant contribution to preexisting work.  Never before had the subject of Quakers in the War been so thoroughly looked upon, and thus this book was a needed addition to history.  However, the author does tend to try making certain details bigger than they are; there is little difference between six Quakers out of sixty in a Quaker community going to war and thirteen out of a community of 118 going to war, but the author seems to fail in her mathematics in treating this as a large difference.  I did like that she gave details into why many Quakers fought; that it was mostly due to Christian patriotism and less to do with national patriotism.  I also appreciated the all-too-brief comparisons between Quakers in the Civil War to those who experienced the American Revolution first hand.<br /><br /> Jacquelyn S. Nelson was certainly interested in this subject; it is unclear whether or not she was a Quaker or not.  She was definitely sympathetic to all the Quakers in the book.  However, she needed to look at the broader prospective of Quakers as a whole, in order that she could show whether or not Indiana Quakers were typical of other Quakers, or this was a simply an occurrence that happened in Indiana.<br /><br /> I have few complaints about the author's writing style.  I had feared it would be much like other scholarly work: rather unreadable with its pompousness.  Instead, the flow in reading this book was undisturbed; I just wish she did not repeat herself as much.  There was little reason to separate the last two chapters in the book, as half of each was the same as the other chapter.<br /><br /> There is a sizeable audience for this book.  Those who will find it the most useful are genealogists who will love the detailed listing of every Quaker the author found while doing her research on those who fought in the War.  Professors and grad students who specialize in studying religious groups in the United States will be the most interested academics in this book.  Civil War historians might see merit in this book, but they will probably wish for more frontline experiences for Quakers rather than so much homefront details.<br /><br /> In conclusion, Indiana Quakers confront the Civil War does a good job in relating its thesis to the reader.  However, I think the author could have gone much deeper than she did; repeating how pacifistic Quakers are usually does not cover up the lack of depth of Quakers during the Civil War as a whole.  Still, a worthwhile book this is.deeper than she did; repeating how pacifistic Quakers are usually does not cover up the lack of depth of Quakers during the Civil War as a whole.  Still, a worthwhile book this is.	2005-04-21

Once you see how skinny the book is, you will start to be concerned.<br /><br />First, what the book does well.  It gives a nice general overview on how to translate d20 Modern occupations, skills, and feats to less modern eras.  The book also does the best job yet for showing how to have a d20 Pirates/1600's setting, complete with a sample adventure.  The various advanced and prestige classes (Explorer, Musketeer, Shaman, and Sorcerer) for that era are also well done.<br /><br />Sadly, once you are done with the section concerning 17th-century adventuring, the book drops down in value fast.  Instead of giving general guidelines for the eras in question, d20 Past force feeds two campaign settings that are only moderately described.  (It gives 24 pages for 17th Century, but only 16 for \\"Shadow Stalkers\\" (Victorian) and 15 for \\"Pulp Heroes\\" (1930's))  Outside of the rifles rules that were presented in the first chapter of the book, there is nothing to recommend getting this book instead of prexisting d20 books like Forbidden Kingdoms from OWC or Masque of the Red Death from S&S.  The adventure models are weak for those eras, and the prestige classes are nothing special.<br /><br />With nothing on how to deal with the Wars of the eras (Napoleon, American revolution, American Civil War, WWI), and the exceptionally-poor-for-WotC artwork in the book, the only reason to pick up this book is if one wants to do 1600's settings using d20 Modern rules.  All others should look instead at the books I previously mentioned.	2005-04-09

The first was originally a pamphlet distributed as a beginners guide to defending the Southern viewpoint.  The second is a transcript of a lecture Rutherford made on November 13, 1974.  Rutherford was the first Historian General of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, and organization of women descended from Confederate veterans who seek to this day to uphold the noble traditions of their forefathers and to protect them from attacks made by those who would besmirch them.  This edition was produced and introduced by Mauriel Joslyn and J.H. Segars. Who wished to put these works of Rutherford's in their proper historical perspective.<br /><br />The introductions bear reading closely.  Let's start with J.H. Segars', who looked at books relating to the South as a whole.  Segars contends that the \\"mystical South\\" was the creation of previously held \\"perceptions\\" that were reinforced by the writings of fiction writers such as William Faulkner.  He then states how writers focus on matters of race, gender, and greed, and ignore all the other facets of Southern life.  Southerners are becoming \\"vocal\\" on how they are being portrayed by Northerners like Burns (one-sided) and Horwitz (fringe-oriented).  Segars contends that the best way to combat this trend is to start reading the works of those who fought for the Confederacy, or were the immediately survivors of these veterans.  That is why he first concentrated on the works of Mildred Rutherford, whose status as a niece of Confederate generals, and worked for both the Lucy Cobb Institute and the United Daughters of the Confederacy made her an excellent voice for the Southern viewpoint.  Segars called Rutherford bold and politically incorrect, and had the best grasp of the soul of the Confederate soldier.<br /><br /> Mauriel Joslyn focused more on Rutherford herself.  This consists of a brief history of Rutherford, including how instrumental Rutherford was in the creation of the United Daughters of the Confederacy.  She needed an organization to support her, and they needed someone who could give written arguments in defense of the memory of Confederate soldiers.  Joslyn credits Rutherford to the creation of so many memorials to the Confederacy at many locations.<br /><br /> One should note Rutherford's writing style, especially in Truths of History.  A college student can not help but envy all the times Rutherford used quotes instead of having to write in her own words.  She would give a few brief quotes, and then remark on them.  This is a process she would repeat consistently.  This allowed Rutherford to write less interpretation, and allow her to make her few interpretations bolder.  Her Table of Contents, which she calls an index, is basically endnotes that are put in front of the main text.<br /><br /> Rutherford is blunt in her introduction what she intended the book to be about.  She saw it as an attempt to counter all the propaganda she saw in history books that neglected the contributions Southerners made in the founding of the United States.  She wanted Truths of History to be an addendum to the textbooks that were used to teach American history, which she said was \\"untrue to the South\\" in 81% of schools, and 17% of them used books that simply omitted important facts.  Southerners should no longer being afraid of speaking out against slander aimed their way from Northerners; they should \\"speak boldly\\".<br /><br /> Rutherford may have made a book of quotations, but her use of these was nothing less than brilliant.  The South had no right to secede?  Tell that to Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin, and Daniel Webster, who made quotes that imply the right of states to secede.  Was Henry Wirz a monster for overseeing the Anderson prisoner?  Then why did prisoners there exoneratehim, as in the quotes Rutherford cites?  The North was friendlier to blacks?  Then why did one Republican threaten to shot any black immigrants to Illinois with a Gatling gun or the Kansas state legislature proclaim that the state was for whites only?  Rutherford further shows where Southerners tried to stop the spread of slavery and Northerners encouraged it growth.  Rutherford's \\"apologies\\" for the South are quite compelling and are must reads for all.<br /><br /> The other work in the volume is Wrongs of History Righted, which was a speech Rutherford made six years before compiling Truths of History.  It is generally a repeat (prepeat?) of Truths.  She makes the same arguments, save that they are not broken into several quotes and clauses.  The passion Rutherford had hen making the speech is reflected in this transcript.<br /><br /> In summary, these works of Mildred Rutherford's should be required reading in any class that teaches the Civil War.  I have never read a book that so clearly stated the South's case for wishing independence.  Any who besmirched Southerners as traitors should read this book, because if this book can not correct their misassumptions, nothing can.here exonerate him, as in the quotes Rutherford cites?

Rutherford's \\"apologies\\" for the South are quite compelling and are must reads for all. <br /> <br /> The other work in the volume is Wrongs of History Righted, which was a speech Rutherford made six years before compiling Truths of History.  It is generally a repeat (prepeat?) of Truths.  She makes the same arguments, save that they are not broken into several quotes and clauses.    The passion Rutherford had hen making the speech is reflected in this transcript. <br /> <br /> In summary, these works of Mildred Rutherford's should be required reading in any class that teaches the Civil War.  I have never read a book that so clearly stated the South's case for wishing independence.  Any who besmirched Southerners as traitors should read this book, because if this book can not correct their misassumptions, nothing can.	2004-12-15

Pg 76-77 was so painful to look at, I could not read it, nor could I read the Hindu sections.<br /><br />2)  As an historian, I'd have loved to see more historical references.<br /><br />3)  It seems like half of each chapter is what is said in every other chapter.<br /><br />4)  Yes, colored pictures may no longer be as expensive as plain pages, but most of Kirschenbaum's samples would require a greater number of pages, increasing the costs of the books.<br /><br />I wonder if she has ever looked at various role playing game books?  Those done by Wizards of the Coast have done what Kirschenbaum suggested for years, with beautiful layouts and nice artwork throughout.  Some have a \\"ruled paper\\" look.  One old line often usen an alternative font, where \\"t\\" was printed as \\"+\\" and similar changes in letters.  Had she looked at these books, she might have avoided some layout problems in her book.<br /><br />I plan to write books in the future, and I will take this book to heart, when I experiment with different fonts instead of using my tried and true Times Roman font.<br /><br />I think the best use of Kirschenbaum's ideals, besides in the schoolroom, would be in celebrity books, where people buy the books more to have them to actually read them; autobiographies by sports figures and politicians especially.	2004-12-01

The only fault in this book is that it is written in archaic 1st Edition D&D rules, which is not that easily adapted to 3.5.  But this book is worth a translation, because it is far superior to its modern counterpart.<br /><br />The rules for new races & classes (including ninja and kensai) are much better presented. The martial arts system is a munchkin's dream (It's pathetically easy for anyone to start doing 3d10 punches), but unlike it's 3e successor, its rich in flavor and easy to advance in a far more logical manner.  The Wu Jen have never been done as well since this edition, and they have many great spells in the book.  As an added bonus, they used a new setting for OA, instead of retrofitting everything to Rokugan, which severely crippled the 3e book.<br /><br />A must have for any RPG collection.	2004-12-01

Or, if they are in 1st and 2nd Edition, they are frustrating to use.  Not this book.  It explains with all the detail that is reasonable to have without overwhelming the reader about \\"powers\\" (gods), proxies, priests, planars, and petitioners.  It further goes into describing what are the perfect gods for various adventurers.  It then goes into a brisk review of many pantheons, from real world ones of Greek, Celtic, and Asian origin, to the pnatheons created exclusively for D&D, describing the home of each god featured in adequent detail.  It is a perfect blen; enough to get the flavor of the god but without going thru each one in an overly detailed and boring way.<br /><br />5 stars.	2004-12-01

Being a devotee of Planescape, I was looking forward to this book, which was supposed to be a reunion on Planescape writers, and comprising of brand-new exciting planes for the planar traveller to enjoy..  Sadly, it was a disappointment.  The first chapter was pretty good, with its discussion on planar connections and planar travel.  However, when he got to the planes, each were lacking.  None feel like they should be a plane; they all felt like they should be a planet that a Spelljammer campaign might visit.  Relit a sun which will warm up the plane and allow life to once again flourish?  That would work better in Spelljammer.<br /><br />A place where LN xorns discourage travellers  so they won't take away the valuable minerals that are as common as dirt on the plane?  That would work better at a Spelljammer planet?<br /><br />A place where spider-like beings have to fight an invading, powerful ant-like beings?  Once again, that's not a plane, that's a planet for a Spelljammer crew to visit.<br /><br />Add to this a lack of crunchy bits like new feats, spells, etc., and you have a mediocre book.  If it was a Spelljammer book, it would rate a 4, or may a 5 due to a dirth of material.  But as a planer guide, which has no planar flavour whatsoever, it ranks its 3, which would have been a 2 save for its worthiness as an unintentional Spelljammer supplement.	2004-10-26

But the later chapters are what makes this book work.<br /><br />Animal does a great job in giving you tips in leaving a scene in a hurry, especially if you are running away from a gang.  Some require prior actions, liking feeding neighborhood dogs, but most do not.  He also discusses how you can counterattack your pursuers.<br /><br />Lastly, Animal talks about how to stay away from those seeking you out. First he tells you how to hide away from the police and organized crime.  Then he tells you how to avoid the local yokals.<br /><br />All in all, a fine book.	2004-07-23

In this collection of issues #1-#6 from 1990, the Guardians are trying to discover what happened to Captain America's shield, and try to attain it.  In pursuit of this gal, they have to face a race of aliens that worship Iron Man (the Stark) and then a band of mercenaries known at Force.<br /><br />Who needs the Legion of Superheros when you have the Guardians?	2004-07-23

The problem is that the begging secion and the next section is done by someone else, and it justs drags the overall stry down, to the point where it seems it hardly has an ending at all.<br />For the record, the story takes place after the episode of ST: Voyager where Q and another have a baby.	2004-07-19

May of Purdue University, offers an in depth look at mid-19th Century filibusters.<br />Dr. May first gives a detailed history of the filibusters.  First, he details the origins of the name and then describes the roots of filibustering.  Then, he details all the prominent attempts to filibuster.  He goes on to explain why Americans filibustered, why the United States government was unable to stop the filibusters, and the logistics involved in financing a filibuster attempt.  Lastly, he deals with the consequences of the filibuster movement; specifically, how it affected United States foreign policy and the War Between the States.<br />Dr. May's goal in writing this book was to give the filibuster movement its proper place in history.  He thought that too few historians had studied what the filibuster movement was, who was involved, how it came about, and its consequences.  Dr. May wished for people to get a better understanding of the filibusters and what they meant in the history of America.<br />Dr. May did an excellent job in making his arguments and conclusions.  Every time he makes a proposition, he backs up the statement with numerous facts.  At the end of the book are 107 pages of notes, showing the amount of detail Dr. May gave to the book.  I had always thought filibusters sought the expansion of slavery, and were few.  This book taught me how widespread the filibuster movement was, and how much United States officials hated it.  I never before realized how much the filibuster movement affected antebellum life in America.  Previous lessons about filibusters never taught me as much as this book; after reading this book, I feel that I have read The Complete Idiot's Guide to Filibusters, only written  in words that do not insult my intelligence.  The author could not have done a better job at illustrating his points.<br /> The best feature of the book is how well organized it is.  Everything is logically discussed at the appropriate time.  The voluminous notes guarantee the academic reliability of the book.<br /> The only thing wrong with this book is that some details were skipped over in order to give further impact of other subjects.  The epilogue was rather rushed; more detail about filibusters adjusting to life after the War Between the States would have been welcomed.  A comparison between the filibusters and the gold miners of the California Gold Rush and the Yukon Rush would have been welcomed.  The legacy of the filibusters in the annexation of Hawaii in the 1890's would also have been welcomed.  Also, the Monroe Doctrine was curiously absent throughout the book; how it was impacted by the filibuster movement seems necessary, but absent.  Still, it is easy to overlook these deficiencies.<br /> Still, I am glad that I have read this book.  As an American historian, I feel now that I had missed out on an important aspect of antebellum American society.  I never before realized how necessary it was for an American historian to have knowledge of the filibusters.logically discussed at the appropriate time.

The background of the book is quite interesting.  One would normally expect a Chinese professor to write in Chinese, not English.  The book is just one volume in a book series entitled \\"The United States and the World: Foreign Perspectives\\".  The series is intended for American readers in the hopes that Americans will gain the perspectives of people around the world and how, in particular, they view the United States.  Thus, Jiang had some leeway in not reciting the \\"party line\\" of Communist China of Chinese/American history, but instead give his own views on the subject.  Jiang knew he was writing to American readers and therefore used both American and Chinese sources in writing his book<br />  Jiang starts the book with saying that, after the American Revolution in 1783, Boston merchants immediately sought trade with China.  He studies this relation up to 1978, when full diplomatic relations were established between the United States and Communist China, a full ten years before he finished and published his book.<br />The only problem with this book is that you need a primer in Chinese history first in order to get anything out of the book.  One needs to understand the overall trends in Chinese history to fully appreciate the nuances of America's relationship with China, and Jiang, unfortunately, overlooks this.	2004-06-07

This is an interesting time to focus on, due to the political situations within each of the states.  For the United States, it was a time when most of the states used forced to keep eleven other states within the nation, and then had to deal with the bitterness caused by the war.  In China the Imperial government was forced to allow Western powers, seen as barbaric by the Chinese, wide access and de facto ownership of several Chinese ports.  This would have been bad enough for the Chinese, but they also had to finally allow foreign diplomats into Beijing on a permanent basis, when originally all such diplomats could go no further than Canton in the southernmost part of China.<br /> Anderson sees America has having to deal with a dichotomy between self-interest and self-sacrifice, and sees this dichotomy in America's initial dealings with China.  Should the United States join with the other Western powers in dividing up China, or should it aid China in its moment of weakness?  Anderson states that the eight American envoys to China between 1861 and 1898 dealt with the failing empire with varying mixtures of selfish imperialism and selfless idealism.  As he focused on th American envoys, almost all of his sources were American in origin<br />After reading Anderson's first two chapters, there is no reason to read others.  It goes in excruciating detail over the most boring and trivial of matters.  Most of these American diplomats had no real impact that any other American could accomplish.  After all, Americans were simply following the European's leads, so American envoys did not lead, therefore they did not have anything to add.  Why would anyone feel the need to belabor on this?  Sadly for Anderson's readers, he felt this necessary.  I spent an hour searching for anything worthy of note that Anderson said, but I could find nothing.  Anderson tried, but he simply could not fill the book with anything but the most boring of minutia.the book with anything but the most boring of minutia.	2004-06-07

Conway does a great job describing the battle.  The problem is that this battle was just big enough to be called a battle, as Morgan's 2500 men fought 400 Home Guards.  That is why the book is forced to cover much of Morgan's Raid, and not just the battle itself.  The book's only weakness is how little its subject matter is, an better overviews of Morgan's entire Ohio Raid are done in far more detail in other books.	2004-05-04

Lots of funny sarcasm and tasty bits of backstage politics.<br />The problem is, it focuses too much on being a history of the last 15 years of pro wrestling, and often lost focus of bringing up the worst ideas in wrestling.  A book similar to the old Baseball Hall of Shame series would have been far better, in which the various catagores of bad ideas are the chapters and then list the most egregious examples.  This is too much of a straight history for a book with its supposed thesis.<br />As a wrestlign book, its five stars.  BHut for one with a specified topic, its only a 4 out of 5.	2004-05-03

It covers the basics well.  It mentions a few deck types and frequently seen cards, so that beginners start off with some knowledge.  It is also a nice feature to have a short article for parents whose kid have just discovered Magic.<br />However, this book does have problems.  First, it is written in an April 2003 mindset, but it has not seen wide release until August 2003.  Much has changed.  Beginners should be immersing themselves with 8th Edition, not retrograding themselves back to 7th.  Also, it chooses some strange things to cover.  For example, beginners don't need much coverage of Type I or Rochester, and they should not even be told about Solomon drafts.  Why the heck mention Solomon drafts?  In nine years of playing Magic I have only seen one done, and it was unsanctioned and over six years ago.  The space dedicated to these topics would have been better served preparing beginners for local tourneys and for trading, giving them advice about how to tell a good trade from a bad trade.  This book does a fine job of illustrating why Magic advice has been concentrated on the internet, and not in an hard form like magazines or books.<br />Those just starting will do OK with this book ...	2003-08-08

I can not think of a novel I would recommend more to a fellow Magic players besides &quot;The Brother's War&quot;.	2003-08-05

Others would be well advised to spend their dollars elsewhere.  The supposed new spells advertised on the cover are not entirely new at all; one has been around for fifteen years.

The interaction of Urza with others made for compelling reading.  Yet, by jumping back and forth through time, the book has no rhythm.  It becomes painful to read.

Garreau did a brillant job in entwining personal dialogues with stats and facts.  The boundaries are well thought out.  The most interesting parts of the book are those that deal with regions that lie partially outside the US (Quebec, Islands, Mexamerica, Ecotopia), but all sections have merit.  Granted, having an updated version of this book would be nice, but that just gives us grad students something to inspire to.  I would definitely recommend that the Aberrations chapter be read by all, as it perfectly demostrates the conflict each nation may inflict on others.	2003-08-03

Each section has a story perspective, to let your know how your character would feel fro experience to experience.  Then, for games 1-3, there is a more traditional walkthrough.<br />However, there is no maps, and no guide telling you what you must do to get various game points.  The fact that there is no traditional walkthrough of QFG4 is glaring.  Worst of all, there is no mentions of the infamous bugs in the games and how to avoid or overcome them.  There are worst guidebooks, but you can not be faulted for feeling that this book is lacking.	2003-08-03

The ones in the old 3.0 were subpar; the new ones added are great, even through they should have left out the Red Wizard one if they insist on it being a Forgotten Realms only class.<br />2)  You want to have extra-planar or epic level adventures.  Well, you can buy the new DMG and skip buying the Manual of the Planes and Epic Handbooks, as the core stuff in both books is in the new DMG as well.  However, you probably don't want to use the Epic system used here, as without the Epic Book's spell seeds, spellcasters are rather subpar.<br />The new DMg is basically the old DMG with all the best stuff from the past 3 years included.  A must buy for any DM, even if you have the old 3e DMG, especially for the ... price.	2003-07-21

My favorite class to play was psionicist.  But with 3rd Edition, psionicists have become nothing more than wimpy mages.<br />Now, I like the idea of a psychic warrior.  That is the one thing the book did right.<br />However, WotC foolishly claims that psionics is magic, when it is inherently not.  They then give the \\"psion\\" all the weakness of a sorceror, but with none of the raw power.  Psionics is now nothing special.  They claim it was for balance, but I think the problem lies on those who do not wish for psionics to have a chance on stepping on wizards' toes.<br />Instead, if you want psionics, I must recommend using \\"Forbidden Kingdoms\\" instead.  Their psionics systems use the skill d20 mechanic instead of the magic mehcanic, and works much better and truer to psionics than this...book.	2003-07-21

However, I can see why some players hate to spend more money to buy the core book.<br />If you like playing Rangers or other sub-par classes, you defintitely want to pick up this book.  Also, if you thought that the skills system in 3.0 needed fixing, here you go.<br />However, if you only play your traditional cleric/fighter/rogue/thief or are short of funds, you can safely skip buying this book.

However, when it comes to the Civil War, he becomes quite hypocritical.  He himself leaves out important facts about the Civil War; instead giving us an ignorant view of the South.  How are we to trust what he says if he himself omits details?  He makes outrageous statements about American soldiers in Vietnam taking body parts from Viet Cong, and then does not give us a suitable reference to this grisly detail.<br />Avoid this book.	2003-07-16

Only the most ignorant of individuals (aka extreme Democrat voters) could continue to see McCarthy as the bad guy and Alger Hiss the good guy after reading this book.<br />After reading this book, I now know why the Left so hates Ann.  She's a sarcastic conservative, like Rush, so she can always make fun of the Left.  Plus, she's sexy, therefore, the left can't do what they like to do with women they dislike (Linda Tripp for example), and disparage her looks.	2003-07-15

First, given how we in America tend to only hear the Israeli side, there should be some voice to the Arabic side.  The book is excellently divided in chapter topics, and is a easy read.<br />Scholars may have little use for the book, but for the lay person and college student, this is a good book.

Even as a graduate student, no other book taught me more about the Muslim mindset.  Compared to Findley's other book, &quot;THEY DARE TO SPEAK OUT&quot;, this is a far more optimistic tome.  I particular enjoyed the section where the Constitution melds perfectly with traditional Islamic belief.  I also liked learning more about why Muslims dress the way they do, how men/women interect, and the growing political power.<br />Sadly, this book has a flaw that is not its own fault; it was released just before the 9/11 attacks, and I felt that the attacks cast a shadow over the book that needed explaining.

That is, reading Tim's, Peter's, and Mike's parts of the book.  Tim's struggles in having to establish a paper in San Francisco, and then following the union movement of 1894 is a fascinating read.  The problems that workers had in acheiving fairness from businessmen was well done.  The brief parts of Peter establishing his motorcar company, and Mike trying to escape from his overprotective parents, were also well done.<br />However, I hated the parts where Eulalia was duped by a man trying to get back at his father by using Eulalia in a way to hurt his father's friend, Toby.

The authors cover geography as done by the ancient Greeks, Phoenicians, Muslims, Chinese, Medieval scholars. Portuguese, and all the explorers during the Age of Exploration.  They excellent cover how hard it was to discard the wrong ideas of the Greeks.  After discussing Humboldt, they then go into the development of geography from 1850 to the present day, which to them was originally in the 1970's, although it has been updated up to 1993. in each of the major countries on the Earth.<br />A definite book for any true geographer to have.	2002-12-17

If one wishes to use more modern d20 supplements like Afghanistan d20, Forbidden Kingdoms, or any of the numerous historical supplements from Avalanche Press, this book will do nicely.  The six basic character classes are generic enough to fit in any &quot;realistic&quot; campaign setting, or at least ones more realistic.<br />However, if you are short on funds, you can skip this book for now if you have 3e D&amp;D.  WotC forced themselves to have a character class based on each ability score, and it makes you wonder.  Does the &quot;Strong Hero&quot; and &quot;Tough Hero&quot; really need to be separate?  These two are the classes most meant to fight, yet splitting them just seems likely to hurt the playing experience.  The differences between &quot;Smart Hero&quot; and &quot;Dedicated Hero&quot; are also rather similar.<br />The wealth system is also odd; its a compromise that will probably please only a few.<br />The new feats and skills were needed, but the advanced classes (d20 Modern's version of prestige classes) don't offer enough diversity.<br />Still, if you got the money and want to run more realistic campaigns, get it.	2002-11-22

I would have never picked up this book, save that I won it at the 2002 GEN CON &quot;Jenn Khan&quot; contest.<br />Yes, it's 40 dollars, but I must highly recommend it once they make a revised edition.<br />8 new character classes are presented, and none are weak.  It even includes two classes that use psionics; a psionic system far superior to the one that TSR published.  The new prestige class are also wonderful.  And the new skills would push this book up to 6 stars, especially with the stats fpor early 1900's cars and weapons.<br />Sadly, I could only rate this a 4, simply to the ABSOLUTELY SLOPPY editing.  WHoever edited this thing should be burned in effigy.  Many class description are worded purely.  (One entire class does not have its benefits described; just the titles.)  Numerous references to &quot;page xx&quot; were left in.<br />Still, I am looking forward to more stuff printed in this series.  They just need to cut back on the price and get a new editor, stat.	2002-10-23

Auguste Lupa is the supposed son of Sherlock Holmes (its always hinted at, but never confirmed).  Lupa must discover, with the help of a French agent, the murderer of a crime.  The murderer turns out to want to disrupt France's war effort.<br />With brillant plot, brillant characters, and a wonderfully done setting, this book of Lescroart should be reprinted and stay in print.  You will not find a better book set in WWI.	2002-10-23

The antagonist in this story is a man named Granger, who is dedicated to preventing the Transcontinental railroad from bisecting his land and is willing to do ANYTHING to keep it so.  This is perhaps the only antagonist in all of Dana Fuller Ross' books that can actually be sympathized with.<br />The two side stories deal with Kale Salton being unable to fulfill her love of the married Rob Martin, and Clarissa Holt discovering that her long-thought-dead first husband, Otto, is still alive.  While the deuk ex machina that the second does to the first is rather obvious, it still set the stages for the events in the next book, Idaho.<br />This book is recommended mostly for those who love novels concerning railroads.	2002-10-22

(Wagons West Series No. 11)	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Interesting book, but stretches stories unneccessarily	This is not a book without merit; it simply is a book that strectches out storylines that could have been wrapped up in one book.  Toby Holt stills has to quell the northern tier from Ma Hastings and Red Cloud, such as he had to in Montana.  Meanwhile, Beth Blake undergoes captivity and a homicide trial that has little in the means of suspense.<br />Still, I like the story dealing with Toby's and Gentle Doe's affair, and the introduction of Kale Salton continues the Ross tradition of having \\"ladies of ill repute\\" seens as angels trapped in a bad guy's profession.  I give this book a generous 4 stars.	2002-10-21

All it is is an excuse for TSR to give those players who prefer evil characters to have lots of tools that most players are nopt allowed to have.<br />Quite frankly, if one wants to add \\"dark stuff\\" their campaign, they are advised to simply skip this book and translate the stuff from VAMPIRE RPG to d20.  They'd be much happoer.	2002-10-21

For me, this is the book that led to the problems the Wagons West/Holts series had at the end.  By no longer having one central character, they weakened the series.  Janessa is a wonderful character, and deserved to have a book featuring her, but the series would have been better off in the long run focusing on Tim Holt.<br />This novel does a wonderful job reflecting what it was like being a Cherokee in the 1890's, as well as dealing with the problems that came with malaria.<br />Still, it is one a reader can safely pass over if need be.	2002-10-16

I have always wanted to play Everquest, but never had the net connection to do it.  After looking at the book at GEN CON 2002 a couple of times, I went and bought it.<br />First, it is mostly compatible with 3rd Ed. D&D but a warning to DMs:  the EQ classes were figured with a different experience table than reg d20.  Instead of needing (current level *1000) more experience points to gain the next level, as in regular d20, you need (current level *2000) to gain the next level, which may result in slower progression of your characters.  Plus, EQ RPG does not use challenge ratings, another divergence from standard d20.<br />My recommendation in using this book is as an extension of TSR's Epic-Character Handbook, as characters above 20th level in EQ keep the same rates in gaining attack bonuses and new spells as they do in lower levels, whereas in TSR's Epic Handbook the rates tend to retard into a slow pace.  There are also spells of up to 14th level in EQ RPG, another perk for Epic Characters to use this book instead.	2002-09-08

Morosly killing off Toby and Alexandra was not needed.  Plus, all 3 main characters ended up wasting their lives.  Had Ross decided to give Frank Blake a chance to successfully impacted Panama, and left it there, it would have been a finer book.  Instead, years pass by with no real impact, and this book is a travesty.	2002-09-08

This book, for example, is clearly better than TSR's &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot;.  The Samurai is done better, and there is a ninja class.  Also of interest is a new class called &quot;courtier&quot;, which is excellent for more cerebral campaigns.<br />Add in the new skills contained in this book, and its easy to recommend this book.	2002-07-11

Want a wizard's tower to be proud of?  Want some cool feats?  This is what this book is about.<br />This is not nearly as compatible with the Sorceror class as one would presume, but still some of it is adaptable.<br />If you like playing wizards, definitely get this book.  SOrceror players would probably like this book as well.	2002-06-25

The &quot;concepts&quot; are not as spectacular as in the first 2, but the prestige classes are nice.  It gives methods for tinkering with Domain Spell alternative, but none that are that great of a replacement.<br />I do like the idea of telling which sacrifices are most appropiate for various gods depending on their domains granted.  I also liked the idea of making sacrifices be worth something to do, although the boons granted as such seem quite weak.<br />If you like clerics, buy this book.

I wish I could rate this book more, because I'd like to consider THIS book the last of the series, and forget that AWAKENING ever existed.  The story now focuses on India Blackstone, Edward Blackstone's daughter, as she tries to become an artist.  The setting, Taos, is exotic, and Henry Blake's travails in the Phillipines also give this book an exotic feel.  Unfortunately, Henry's story is rather brief and India is too new a character for us to really care about, if you are a regular of the series.<br />Still, this book is not bad.  If you want a feel for the Old West from the Indian prospective, buy it.	2002-02-12

There are four stories in this book:<br />1) Janessa starts medical school.<br />2) Tim runs off to become a miner.<br />3) Toby runs for senator<br />4) White Elk courts a chinese girl<br />Surprising, the stories do not conflict with each other, a problem that later books in the series would have.  It is a beautifully crafted book.<br />It also illustrates what the rest of the books should have done.  It should have stayed with Tim as the focal character in the series.  By constantly switching the main characters from book to book, it weaken the series as a whole.<br />Highly recommended book, especially when one wants to read about prejudice towards Chinese.	2002-02-12

Here you go.<br />The only problem is that it is not ready for d20, but the necessary updating will help you get your viking campaign off the ground.  Buying &quot;Greenland Saga: The Lost Norse Colony&quot; from Avalanche Press will help you in this regard.	2001-11-25

Fantasy Roleplaying, HR4 )	Books	4	3	4	N	N	The most modern of D&amp;D sourcebooks	Have you ever wanted to be a pilgrim.  Or maybe follow in the footsteps of Francis Drake.  Then this is the book for you.  Although printed for 2nd edition AD&amp;D, this book is still your best source for more modern adventuring.  The book does need to be converted for d20, but any good DM should be able to do that.  Furthermore, if you wanted to adventure in the 1800's, this is the closest publication yet to that time frame.  Simply update the firearms, and much of the work is done.<br />Still, the problem with the historical sourcebooks of AD&amp;D is that they like to hinder your characters with kits that HURT your PC, with no compensation.  Furthermore, they do not open avenues for more fantasical elements.  STill, this is a good book.	2001-11-25
US	42357512	R3XZ3Q1ZBOKKO	055326849X	153707141	Kentucky! (Wagons West #20)	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A misnamed book, but a good read.	This book screams out the problem Ross would have in naming his books: the  novels were not confined to any one state by this point.  Heck, the novel was over 2/3s of the way thru before Toby even set foot in Kentucky.  Still, you have intrigue (assassination plot on Grant), turmoil over the 1973 depression, and international turmoil with Henry Blake over in Europe.  A fun read.<br />NOTE: this is the book that introduces us to Alexandra, who would later play such a pivotal role in this series and the HOLTS series.	2001-09-18

Like the other WW books, its an engaging read.  My quabbles with the book is its time frame; how much time passes in this book is beyond me.  A few months?  4 years?  I also do not like how Elisabeta had such an ignoble end.  Still, this is the novel to read for inspiration on the Gold Rush.	2001-09-18
US	42357512	R1JKCUD5DM845J	0966528034	394573698	Blood of Heroes Role-Playing Game : Special Edition	Books	4	6	7	N	N	The best Super Hero RPG ever, rules wise	The system that worked so well for the original DC Superheroes game has its FIFTH edition, but now its called Blood of Heroes Special Edition.  Rules wise, it has everyting needed to play all sorts of superheroes, as more powers, skills, and common sense is involved in this edition.  However, the reason I only give this 4 stars is because of the new setting that Pulsar games had to use because the DC liscense was unavailable to it.  Without established heroes, the game settings just fall thru.  Still, it is not that hard to find old DC sourcebooks in used-game bins at gaming stores, so you can still use that setting.<br />This would also be the ideal book to use in creation of a Transformers RPG setting, as the exp[onential system would work well when dealing with those in power level from Bumblebee to Fortress Maximus.<br />Note that this system would be lousy to use if everybody just played pure humans, as the skills just do not diversify other characters from your own.<br />Still, a great RPG.	2001-09-18

Hey, someone contradicts Andrew Jackson in the FIRST sentence.<br />With an interesting cast of characters, as well as action and intrigue, this book has it all as the wagon train starts its journey to Oregon by covering the eastern half of the US.  Historically, settlers Oregon-bound did not start until around 1844, but we can let that slide.  What is strange is that THE principle cast in this book take a diminished role in future titles, save for Cathy Van Ayl.  (I'm not counting Whip, who was more prominent later on in Nebraska and aafterward).  A MUST READ.	2001-09-18

(Wagons West)	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Not bad, but not the best of the WW series	Maybe it's because it's the first non-Oregon Trail book in the series, but Texas just does not have the &quot;oomph&quot; of most of the other books. The major characters of the series so far take a backseat to lesser characters in this book, breaking away much of the familiarity with the series. It is still a good book, especially if you want a novel set during the Mexican-American war. However, don't lose any sleep if you are trying to read the entire series and can't find this one in your library.	2001-08-29

Idaho is not a bad book, especially if you wish to read/collect the entire series. But somehow, it just didn't jell with me. Maybe because outside of Edward Blackstone no idea of importance got introduced in this book. Or maybe it was because Ross tried to put too much in one book.	2001-08-29
US	42357512	R19858MOCGDJHF	0553229257	366545194	Montana! (Wagons West)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Henry Blake	I don't see how this book could be rated a 1. LIke most of the Wagon's West series, I'd have to give it a 5. The Highlights of this book are: 1) Henry (Hank) Blake makes his first appearnce in the series. 2) This book helps sets the tone for the future books, as Toby Holt and Co. take charge of the series as the focal characters. Definitely get this book if your reading this series. Not a bad read if you're not.	2001-08-29

This book allows you to play druids that are specialized for swamps, jungles, deserts, polar, and forest climes; no single catch-all druid abilities. The kits are also wonderful and will be excellent sources for new 3e prestige classes. Want ideas for your druids in your campaign? This book gives it to you in spades. DEFINITELY go find this book.	2001-08-29

Here is a book that seems like it should be great for a Magic player, but in the end, it is a waste of money.

That is why I'm sadden to only give this book 3 stars. The author showed no imagination in how various cards could work. He offers no real analysis of the cards that could not be gleemed from older articles about M:TG on the net. If you can get this book cheap, then go ahead. But don't pay full price for it, as Visions has long ago left the TYPE-II environment.	2001-08-28
