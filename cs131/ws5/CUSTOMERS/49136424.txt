Clearly, George Wythe was a key man behind the scenes of the birth of the USA and the Consitiution.<br />The method used to educate Thomas Jefferson (and all great leaders throughout history) is simply this:<br />1)  Classics and Mentoring<BR>2)  Depth and Breadth<BR>3)  Quality and Application<br />DeMille notes:  &quot;Whatever the culture, look at its greatest leaders and you will find that they were <BR>1) guided by at least one mentor and <BR>2) made a lifetime study of classic works.&quot;<br />So, what does this imply about our current school system based on standardized textbooks and tests, tests and more tests?  It is just a &quot;conveyor belt&quot; preparing us for mediocrity (&quot;a job&quot;).<br />Get this book and learn how to mentor your children with the Classics so they will have a chance of making a difference.<br />A Thomas Jefferson Education = LEADERSHIP Education.	2004-06-26

More could not do it in good conscience because he knew it violated God's Law.  More was willing to risk his life to keep his conscience clean.<br />This play disproves the old saying that \\"every man has his price.\\"   Fortunately, some people, like More,  have been willing to lift us to higher standard of behavior by standing on prnciple.<br />I love books which demonstrate solid moral values and which are based on real history.

So it is the first edition (with a slightly different title [\\"..up to $100,000...\\"] before the inflation of the '70's).<br />This book helped give me my first dream of being self-employed.  It gave me my first education in how to run the \\"nuts and bolts\\" operation of a small business (especially mail-order).<br />Sure, it's got it's share of hype and \\"positive\\" talk, but that is what I needed at that stage in my development into a self-employed business owner.  It also lacks details that you will need with your own business.  But so what?  If you are serious about starting your own business, you'll be wanting to read several other books, anyway, to gain the help you need.  Some of it will be general information, like this book, and others will contain more specific information about your particular industry/trade.<br />32 years later, I'm self-employed and have been that way for the last 15 years, at least.

I'm not sure that I had ever heard of this incident before reading this book. I know it was never recorded in any of the text books that my Public School used for their curriculum. Yet 80 years ago, almost all school children were taught about this incident. <br />And what's more important--It really happened, it's verifiable, and it was COMMON KNOWLEGE to Colonists during the Revolutionary War era. This is one of the reasons so many people had such trust in George Washington during the Revolutionary War and afterwards. They knew that he was protected by God.<br />This booklet gives the account of the battle in which General George Braddock is ambushed during the French and Indian War. General Braddock is killed and all of the mounted officers are killed or wounded except ONE (George Washington). Washington escapes unhurt, without a scratch, though several horses are shot out from underneath him during the 3-hour (I think) battle, and his coat is riddled with bullet holes.<br />--George Stancliffe	2002-07-22

IT'S OBVIOUS THAT----	---JOSEPH SMITH HAD GREAT MENTORS WITHIN HIS FAMILY, AND THEN HE WAS MENTORED BY DEITY.<br />Reading the revelations received by the prophet Joseph Smith are inspirational.  But it is good to see the restoration from the point of view of his mother.  She tells some stories that we wouldn't know from any other source (like the story of his leg operation at age 9).  <br />I was mostly impressed with how much constant persecution and distraction Joseph Smith and his family had to endure ON AN ONGOING BASIS for the whole time Joseph Smith was prophet.  It never let up.  It's a miracle that he was able to accomplish anything at all.<br />Many stories were ones I had never heard before.  One story that I had never heard before was the time Joseph Smith's dad was thrown in jail for 30 days for a minor debt he owed.  They told him they would let him free if he would just deny his testimony.  He stayed in prison the whole 30 days and converted another person while in jail.<br />By reading this book, we can have Joseph Smith and his family (especially his mother) be OUR OWN MENTORS, to help us to be the kind of people they were.<br />--George Stancliffe	2002-07-19

Of course this is understood widely nowadays (at least among those who think).  But 40 years ago it was popular to believe in other causes like \\"overexpansion of productive capacity\\" or other fallacies.  Rothbard convincingly flushes these other theories down where they belong.<br />I believe the most lasting contribution of this book is to clearly show the basics of economics, in language that anybody can understand (Ludwig von Mises is considered the greatest ecnomist of the Austrian School of Economics, but have YOU ever tried to read his \\"Theory of Money and Credit?\\".

When he went to the U. of Chicago, he would pay 25 cents to dance to LW live each Saturday night).<br />This book is an Autobiography of Lawrence Welk, so it tells much about his private life from birth on up.  He got into having his own band during the 1920's when radio was new and he had to really struggle to get anybody to hear him at all.  It was worse than a Gypsy's life on the road.  <br />He tells many very interesting stories of playing engagements, how they were promoted, what different audiences were like, etc.  <br />One story that made me laugh out loud was how in certain areas of the country it was not uncommon for people to bring a gun to a dance, and if someone's girlfriend got looked at by an undesireable competitor, shots would be fired.  LW and his band got to where they didn't even bother getting off the stage.  They would just hide behind the piano until the shooting was over, then they would get out and keep playing, while members of the crowd would haul off the injured parties.  I don't think anybody died at any of his concerts, but it seems clear that the spirit of the American Frontier was still alive into the 30's, at least.<br />I gained a real appreciation for Lawrence Welk after reading this book.<br />--George Stancliffe	2002-07-18

I also appreciate the fact that the author doesn't pander to the sleaze that so many authors resort to in order to make  a few extra sales.  In fact he shows why the recent smear tactics on Jefferson are fraudulent.<br />THREE CHEERS FOR ANDREW ALLISON FOR HIS COURAGE TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT JEFFERSON!!!<br />The last 330 pages of text contain quotations from Thomas Jefferson himself on many different subjects.  Each of these quotations is placed alphabetically according to the subject that it deals with.  This way a reader can use this book as a reference to look up what Thomas Jefferson believed on any particular issue.  This last section of the book was prepared by Cleon Skousen, Richard Maxfield and Delynn Cook, and is, by itself, worth the price of the book.<br />--George Stancliffe	2002-07-17

From then on, his life was one of total committment and devotion to God's work on Earth.<br />Pratt served several missions for the Church and also suffered through many persecutions with the Prophet Joseph Smith himself, including several months in a filthy jail cell in 1838-1839.

But the Oak and the Calf is a personal history of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (arguably the greatest living writer in the world).<br />At a time when the punishment for owning a copy of Gulag was DEATH, Solzhenitsyn was not afraid to stand up to the Soviet system ALONE AND UNARMED (He has a lot in common with Mahatma Ghandi).  <br />When you are armed with truth and you stand firm, it is Evil itself that must eventually back down.<br />How did Solzhenitsyn gain so much courage?  How did he handle the Soviet system without becoming a corpse?  How was he able to write his first several books while still a prisoner in the prison camps?  What kept him going when things looked the most bleak?<br />We can learn much about commitment, will-power, and dedication to principles of truth by seeing how Solzhenitsyn did it.

The differences between the Right-Brained and Left-Brained children in my classes was amazing.  Based on my experience, Mr. Freed is right on target.  Right-Brained people really do make the best speed readers.  Jeffrey Freed's discovery was so important that when I updated my own book (Speed Reading 4 Kids) in 2000, I needed to add a new chapter explaining these differences.<br />I often recommend this book to parents of ADD, ADHD and Dyslexic children so they can understand their children's different learning needs.	2002-07-05

And after 30 years, the world still doesn't have a clue how important his discoveries are.<br />I'll admit, the only motive that I had to speed read, at first, was to go through  my college textbooks faster and cut my study time in half.  <br />What got my attention was the VISION that McBride showed for the subject of Speed Reading.  <br />For example, McBride experimented with the idea of TEACHING FOREIGN LANGUAGES USING SPEED READING TECHNIQUES.  Here how it works:<br />Many pages of reading material (stories) are translated from English into Spanish.  Each line of English text is followed by the identical line of text in Spanish.  So each page of the story has alternating lines of English and Spanish.  This allows the children to see all the words and their respective translations at a glance. <br />For the next 6 weeks, the children are taught to speed read, using hundreds of pages of the bi-lingual text as the reading material.  At the end of 6 weeks, the children are able to speed read Spanish-only text at up to 2,000 wpm, with comprehension.<br />Really.<br />I know it sounds improbable, but take a look at Dr. McBride's other achievements:<br />1)  He discovered and pioneered the idea that young children can and should be taught to speed read.  He was virtually ignored for over 30 years.  His work is still ignored by most of the experts and many within the speed reading industry itself.  <br />Dr McBride's book was so good, that when I finally wrote a book of my own (SPEED READING 4 KIDS) I dedicated it to Vearl G. McBride.<br />After having taught speed reading to thousands of people, myself, from ages 7 through 77, I can say with confidence that young children from ages 8-12 learn speed reading the easiest of any age group.  I know many parents and teachers who have achieved similar results in teaching children to speed read (even parents who can't speed read themselves can teach it to kids).<br />2)  He improvised a way to teach blind people to speed read in Braille.  He even conducted 2 or 3 workshops in Hong Kong for this very purpose and received an award from the government of Hong Kong for his achievement.  <br />His fastest Braille speed reader attained a rate of 4,000 wpm with good comprehension<br />3)  He was the first one, that I am aware of, who taught that many of the Learning Disabled can do quite well with speed reading.  I have found in my own work that children with such so-called disabilities as ADD, Dyslexia and some others, actually seem gifted when it comes to learning to speed read.  Many of these are the very ones who get photographic memories when they master the art of speed reading.<br />These are just three areas in which there is independent verification of the results he claimed.  I have seen some of these results in my own work (I haven't attempted the Braille experiment myself yet, but I am aware of the award that the government of Hong Kong gave to Dr. McBride).  In fact, in every facet of speed reading that I have experimented with myself, I have also received the same results claimed by Dr. McBride.<br />So, even though I haven't personally verified every experiment that Dr McBride did (yet), I have great faith in the results he claimed.  <br />I am hoping that more people will come forward to start making many of his other innovations a universal reality.  Speed reading in foreign languages is one thing that should be experimented with soon. <br />Another innovation that Dr. McBride worked on is SPEED MATH.<br />How did Dr McBride do that?<br />First they would write up many math problems (in this example, addition problems) per page, on hundreds of pages of paper.  Using speed reading techniques, the children would go over these problems at the rate of thousands of problems per minute.  After 6 weeks or so, the children would be able to view any addition problem and instantly tell the answer.  Even large stacks of numbers could be added instantly.<br />I've had a personal friend for over 15 years who can look at a whole page of numbers added together and instantly know the correct answer.  In my friend's case, nobody taught him the skill.  He's always been able to do this since he was a child.  My friend uses this skill in his business constantly.  It has helped him to earn a large income and still have time for his family. <br />Dr. McBride used the principles of speed reading to train whole classes of children to have this very skill.  Who wouldn't want their second-grade child to be this good at math? <br />Can you see where we're headed with speed reading?  To borrow a popular slogan A MIND IS A TERRIBLE THING TO WASTE.  Our minds have almost unlimited potential if we just open our eyes and see the possibilities.<br />I only wish Dr McBride would republish this book or come out with a revised, updated edition.	2002-01-31
