Many of the books I love, such as Carolyn See's \\"Making a Literary Life\\" and Barbara Grizzuti Harrison's \\"Italian Days,\\" are as much about their authors as their stated subjects. Ian Frazier's \\"Family\\" also is highly personal, yet remarkable in how Frazier presents his memoirs of growing up in Ohio, adds a meticulously researched history of his ancestors, and conflates it all into a profoundly moving meditation on a country, a society and the human condition. \\"Family\\" is a book that you'll read from cover to cover without being able to put it down, then pick up often to dip into, savoring favorite parts and the rich, supple excellence of Frazier's prose. Always poignant but never sentimental, \\"Family\\" takes us through two hundred years of the lives of various Fraziers, Wickhams, Hurshes, Bachmans and Chapmans--the genealogy that culminated in David and Kate Frazier of Hudson, Ohio, their son Ian, and his four brothers and sisters. Frazier leads us off into far-ranging but fascinating and germane tangents: Discussing a Civil War skirmish in which his great-great-grandfather Charlie Wickham fought, Frazier goes off into the life story of the leader of the opposing forces in that skirmish--Stonewall Jackson. Throughout the book, Frazier shows an unerring eye for the telling detail that throws situations and personalities into dazzling focus. He also makes us love each and every one of the family members, past and present, that he writes about, and moves us to tears with his descriptions of the deaths of his father, his mother, and his young brother Fritz. Here is how Frazier describes his thoughts at his mother's deathbed: \\"(S)oon all the people who had accompanied me through life would be gone, too, and then even the people who had known us, and no one would remain on earth who had ever seen us, and those descended from us perhaps would know stories about us, perhaps once in a while they would pass by buildings where we had lived and they would mention that we had lived there. And then the stories would fade, and the graves would go untended, and no one would guess what it had been like to wake before dawn in our breath-warmed bedrooms as the radiators clanked and our wives and husbands and children slept.\\" To read \\"Family\\" is to gain a fonder, fuller appreciation of our own families, and of all the blessed ties that bind.ed there.

Ever since the publication of \\"Can Poetry Matter?\\" the essayist and Formalist poet Dana Gioia has been one of the most polarizing figures in the current literary world. The controversy around Gioia redoubled when he accepted President Bush's invitation to become chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, causing more left-leaning poets to accuse him of \\"selling out.\\" While I don't agree with everything Gioia says, and I'm certainly further to the left than he is, I think his opinions on the current state of poetry are never less than interesting and usually salutary. For instance, I couldn't agree more that poetry and music go well together on the same program, or that poets should mix their own work in public readings with favorite poems by others. Above all, Gioia has been a forceful advocate for poets in general and for the traditional craft of poetry in particular, and my hat is off to him for that. In \\"Disappearing Ink,\\" his latest collection of essays, Gioia once again waves a red cape in the face of the academic establishment, banderilla at the ready. (Example: in the title essay, Gioia notes, \\"Attend an academic literary conference these days and you are more likely to hear, as I recently did, papers on the design of the Los Angeles freeway system as an expression of phallocentric power or gender-coding in breakfast cereal advertising than you are to find examinations of contemporary poetry.\\") The title essay, which discusses how the poetry scene is changing as the printed word gives way to the information highway, is a provocative yet common-sense examination of rap, cowboy poetry, performance poetry and other avenues poetry is taking toward survival in the 21st century. Gioia provides much reading pleasure in his discussion of various subjects, from the decline of San Francisco as an active literary center to the history of Italian-American poetry. He is at his most enjoyable when he comes to the defense of poets he admires, from misjudged classic poets (Longfellow, Frost) to underappreciated contemporary poets (John Haines, Samuel Menashe, Kay Ryan). He champions some poets you wouldn't expect him to defend, such as the late Jack Spicer, an openly gay San Francisco Bohemian who would be anathema to many in the Bush administration. His observations are nearly always astute, such as when he delineates the reasons why Elizabeth Bishop--whom he clearly reveres, but who doesn't really fit current poetic fashion--is a poetic god today: \\"During the bitterly divisive culture wars of the past quarter-century, Bishop could simultaneously appear on both sides of nearly every issue--the ally of both reformer and traditionalist, patron saint to both radical and reactionary--not to mention those beleaguered pilgrims traveling steadfastly in the middle of the road.\\" Basically, Gioia just calls them the way he sees them, which is what a literary critic is supposed to do--except that too many have pulled their punches recently, to try and fit in with the tide of current opinion. Above all, Gioia believes in the art of poetry, and has faith that it will survive--in his words, \\"(m)ostly by being itself--concise, immediate, emotive, memorable, and musical, the qualities most prized in the new oral culture, which are also the virtues traditionally associated with the art.\\" I wish I'd said that.ets (Longfellow, Frost) to underappreciated contemporary poets (John Haines, Samuel Menashe, Kay Ryan).

Whereas Pablo Medina's first two novels, \\"The Marks of Birth\\" and \\"The Return of Felix Nogara,\\" were panoramic, semi-satiric murals of Cuban society and the Cuban exile experience, his new book, \\"The Cigar Roller\\" is a pungently poetic miniature concentrating on one brutal, careless yet richly human character. Amadeo Terra--lover of earth--is the titular cigar roller, left paralyzed and speechless in a 1940s Tampa hospital after a massive stroke. He blinks, he drools, he defecates, he eats the tasteless mush his nurse spoon-feeds him. Then, one day, the nurse gives Amadeo a spoonful of pureed mango, and--like a debased, low-down Proust--he finds that the paradisal taste causes all the memories of his life to come tumbling back to him. In deliberately disordered but evocative detail, Medina contrasts Terra's miserable present with his rough-and-tumble past, his snatch-and-grab philosophy of life, and--at the end--the horrible secret he must finally face up to. Amadeo is often hateful, but--presented as we are with the totality of his thoughts--we hesitate to call him evil. To know is to understand, and possibly even to forgive. Amadeo's story is interlaced with the dramatic history of Cuba in the late 19th century--the Spanish occupation and native insurgency that led to the Spanish-American War--and should tantalize American readers enough to look deeper into the subject. Short and exquisitely honed, \\"The Cigar Roller\\" is a compelling character study that lingers in the memory.	2005-04-23

As with any poems translated from a language I have never learned, I am left wondering just how close Edmund Keeley and Philip Sherrard have come to the original style and substance of C.P. Cavafy, the great Alexandrian Greek poet of the early 20th century. (Keeley and Sherrard are scrupulous in their end notes, noting untranslatable words and the original rhyme schemes of poems translated into free verse.) Even in translation, these poems are exquisite, haunting both my dreams and my waking thoughts. Cavafy essentially had only a few subjects, but they were great ones--the lost glory of antiquity, the inevitable decline of the mighty, the death of love and beauty, the folly of human striving, the crucial importance of memory and history. In language of deceptive simplicity, he limned the ephemeral nature of beautiful things and the empty spaces their loss leaves in the soul. (Cavafy, openly gay at a time when homosexuality was truly the love that dare not speak its name, wrote only of lost, passing or unrequited love.) Most of these poems are very short, but they insinuate themselves inextricably into memory, such as \\"The Mirror in the Front Hall,\\" depicting a handsome young man who stops to straighten his tie: \\"the old mirror was all joy now,/proud to have embraced/total beauty for a few moments.\\" My own favorite in the book is one of the longer poems, \\"Orophernis,\\" about a wastrel king of the 2nd Century B.C. who came to grief trying to be a real king for once. The final five lines of this poems are Cavafy in a nutshell;<br /><br />The figure on this four drachma coin,<br />a trace of whose young charm can still be seen,<br />a ray of his poetic beauty--<br />this sensuous commemoration of an Ionian boy,<br />this is Orophernis, son of Ariarathis.	2005-04-16

I've never been a particular Faulkner fan, but after reading Jay Parini's \\"One Matchless Time,\\" I may well have to revise that opinion. I certainly will have to turn back to Faulkner's books! Parini's book is as enthralling as any literary biography I've ever read, telling a compelling story of a unique literary genius who persevered at his art with almost feral intensity and courage, despite universal discouragement from family, neighbors and editors. Parini is judicious in his appraisal of Faulkner's work, admitting that his fiction was wildly uneven but adding that the greatest Faulkner novels succeed grandly because Faulkner was not afraid to fail grandly. (Faulkner recognized Thomas Wolfe as a kindred spirit in this regard, and criticized Hemingway for not having the courage to risk failure in his fiction.) Parini also duly notes the knotty difficulty of the Faulknerian prose style: \\"Faulkner cannot be read; he can only be reread,\\" he states astutely. He admits that Faulkner-a man who tried out many personae during his life and told outrageous tall tales about himself--in the end can never be adequately summarized as a man, but adds that he hopes this book \\"will bring readers back where they belong, to Yoknapatawpha County.\\" I've already bought my ticket! As fine as this book is, however, the proofreading is horrible. Many words are misspelled (Albemarle County, in Virginia, is rendered throughout as \\"Albermarle\\") or left out of sentences, creating unnecessary confusion. There are also some factual howlers, such as the following sentence: \\"On August 25, Faulkner turned fifty.\\" The problem is that in several other places the book notes, correctly, that Faulkner's birthday was SEPTEMBER 25! With all due respect to Parini's talents, such obvious mistakes make me wonder about possible errors I have no means to check. And HarperCollins--one of the most illustrious names in American publishing--issued this book!	2005-01-05

I picked up a used copy of \\"The Queen's Gambit\\" not because I was fascinated by the subject matter, but because Walter Tevis was a writing professor at Ohio University, my alma mater. (I never had him for a class, though I did interview him for a university publication.) I had never read anything by Tevis--not even his bestsellers, \\"The Hustler\\" and \\"The Man Who Fell to Earth\\"--but \\"The Queen's Gambit\\" makes me want to rush out and find every Tevis book I can. In \\"The Queen's Gambit,\\" Tevis creates a singular, and singularly moving, lead character--Beth Harmon, an orphaned, alcoholic, drug-addicted teenage girl who also happens to be one of the greatest chess prodigies the world has ever seen. Left alone in the world at the age of eight, hooked on tranquilizers by the monsters who run her orphanage, Beth is buffeted on all sides by enemies and fools. She finds her only lasting solace in the black and white figures on the chessboard, living and reliving those strategies as if her life depends on it (which, in the end, it does). Beth is so real, and so heartrending, that she and her story will linger with you long after you've finished the book. The book contains a great deal of chess terminology and strategy--two things of which I am profoundly ignorant and profoundly uninterested. Yet Tevis made me feel the excitement Beth feels in playing the game, and involved me totally in her life-and-death struggle to master it. Even if you don't like chess, you will like \\"The Queen's Gambit.\\" My guess is that if you love the game, you will adore \\"The Queen's Gambit.\\"	2004-12-04

(It had been retitled \\"Ten Little Indians\\" as a promo for the movie of the same name starring Hugh O'Brian and Stanley Holloway, based on \\"And Then There Were None.\\") I did not yet realize that being a great genre writer didn't necessarily mean you were a great writer, and I also didn't know about editors and how even they can sometimes be asleep at the wheel. But, in any case, those two sentences--which even to my fourth-grade eyes seemed awfully inept--were what stayed with me from the book, more than anything else. \\"And Then There Were None\\" is widely considered to be Agatha Christie's masterpiece, the sheer ingeniousness of the plot mixing with an aura of impending doom to make an overwhelming reading experience. I guess that's true, and maybe I'm just too picky, but I keep thinking how much better the book would have been if written by, say, Raymond Chandler, or someone else who knew how to write a decent sentence. This is the main reason why I prefer film adaptations of Dame Agatha's books to the books themselves. Give me Albert Finney, David Suchet or Peter Ustinov as Poirot any day!	2004-10-17

We already know at the beginning that Lexy Ransome climbed the apple tree in her back yard, fell, and died. But WHY did she do it? Paul Iverson, her staid college professor husband, becomes obsessed with that question, and with learning the truth from the only witness to Lexy's fall: Lorelei, Lexy's Rhodesian Ridgeback dog. \\"The Dogs of Babel\\" alternates between Paul's memories of Lexy--a woman as impulsive and changeable as her husband is steady and stodgy--and his attempts to get Lorelei to communicate in human language. His obsession even leads him to the Cerberus Society, a truly terrifying group of maniacs who use surgical means in their efforts to reshape the canine mouth for human speech. (Paul's visit to the society is one of the most unnerving passages I've read in recent fiction; Parkhurst shows us just enough, and leaves the rest to our imaginations--the hallmark of a writer who understands how to terrify a reader.) Parkhurst's writing is lucid and lyrical, and she demonstrates a fundamental comprehension of both the irrationality of love and the impossibility of really understanding another human soul. She makes Paul a heart-rendingly sympathetic narrator, and in the end she allows him as much peace of mind as anyone who has lost the love of his life can ever really have. This is an odd, touching, and rewarding book.	2004-09-04

Christopher Conlon is a master of historic narrative poetry, his books as immediate and thrilling as any novel. His previous book, &quot;Gilbert and Garbo in Love,&quot; was a brilliant reimagining of the parallel lives of the great silent screen lovers; his new one, &quot;The Weeping Time,&quot; expands on that achievement, bringing into breathtaking focus not only the lives of his characters, but also the whole blighted story of slavery in the antebellum South. Taking as his starting point a tragic historical event--the largest slave auction in American history, on March 2, 1859--Conlon presents the story leading up to that event, through the eyes of three characters: Pierce Butler, owner of the slaves; Fanny Kemble, his abolitionist, English actress wife; and Jack, an amalgam of the hundreds of slaves led to suffering and ruin through Butler's cruelty and profligacy. Conlon alternates points of view between the three characters, bringing them all to memorable life through sharp writing and acute psychological insight. Even Butler comes across as sympathetic to a degree, but readers are most likely to remember Jack's story of pure suffering, as in &quot;Learning the Language&quot;:<br />As a boy Jack would use many words,<br />and sometimes they earned him<br />a harsh rebuke in return, a slap across<br />the face, the lash itself over his back<br />and shoulders, and so he learned to speak,<br />to remove the bad and stupid language<br />like why and stop and wrong<br />and replace it with just one word, a word<br />that was always the right word,<br />and so to the Major he says Yes,<br />and to the Missis he says Yes,<br />and to their children he says Yes,<br />and to the overseer he says Yes,<br />and to every white person he sees<br />on God's Earth he says Yes, and it's<br />a beautiful and harmonious world<br />of Yes which he says again and again,<br />even in his sleep, to smother the No<br />that always lurks at the base<br />of his spine, hot, acidic, ready to spring.	2004-07-11

From Baron Joseph von Trotta--a simple peasant soldier ennobled after saving Emperor Franz Joseph's life at the Battle of Solferino--the Trotta family's torch passes to son Franz, a dignified, meticulous, unimaginative regional official, and finally to grandson Carl Joseph, a decent, weak-willed young army lieutenant totally unsuited to the life he was forced into. Carl Joseph tumbles into drink and debt as ossified bureaucracy and resurgent nationalism pushes the far-flung, anachronistic empire toward its doom. Author Joseph Roth, though clear-eyed about the empire's many faults and injustices, nevertheless found it preferable to what came after it. (It is no surprise upon reading this novel to learn that Roth drank himself to death on the eve  of the Nazi takeover of Europe.)  While I have some questions about Joachim Neugroschel's translation--for example, did Roth really switch so haphazardly between the present and past tenses?--there is no denying the dark, poignant power of \\"The Radetzky March.\\" The Everyman's Library hardcover edition includes an astute and illuminating introduction by Alan Bance, as well as a useful timeline of Roth's life.	2004-05-29

The archetypal Chinese mother and the ultimate pragmatist, Mrs. Wei takes a vigorous, no-nonsense approach to a world filled with unreasonable gods and men. Whether helping a young girl fend off the unwanted advances of a lecherous monk (&quot;Mrs. Wei on the Bus&quot;) or battling a deadly cobra who invades her henhouse (&quot;Mrs. Wei and the Thief&quot;), Mrs. Wei combines a philosopher's equanimity with a policeman's courage and moral clarity. As created by Hilary Tham, Mrs. Wei is a magnificently rich, fully realized character, and &quot;The Tao of Mrs. Wei,&quot; the collected Mrs. Wei poems, is a triumph of modern narrative poetry, offering the same pleasure as a finely wrought book of interrelated short stories. In this book we get not only a portrait of an unforgettable character, but of the society--the Chinese minority in Malaysia--that shaped her. Mrs. Wei always calls 'em the way she sees 'em, whether commenting on Osama bin Laden (&quot;All I can say is: Here is a rat,/a rat crossing the street/to bite a tiger's tail&quot;) or on her daughter's spoiled house cat (&quot;Buddha bless us--that cat will be disappointed/when he gets reborn as a human, he'll think/he's really come down in the world&quot;). And she always gives as good as she gets, as demonstrated in this collection's hilarious opening poem, &quot;Mrs. Wei &amp; Ancestor Worship&quot;:<br />An Englishman is visiting his mother's grave<br />with flowers. He sees Mrs. Wei<br />spreading a feast of roast chicken,<br />moo shu pork, noodles<br />before her father's grave.<br />&quot;When's your father coming out<br />to eat that food?&quot; he asks.<br />Smiling, Mrs. Wei answers,<br />&quot;Same time your mother<br />come to smell flowers.&quot;	2004-04-10

Kennedy and the late John Frederick Nims, A.M. Juster excels in epigrammatic, flowing yet tightly constructed formal verse. This sort of cool, witty elegance was casually discarded by most American poets sometime around 1950, but fortunately a few noble eccentrics such as Juster have insisted on reviving it. The long title poem of \\"The Secret Language of Women,\\" set in an indeterminate, long-ago imperial China before shifting at the end to the time of Mao, is a superb example of formal narrative verse and a moving demonstration that poetry may be driven underground, but it can never be killed. However, I found myself even more attracted to the shorter, funnier pieces--the excellent translations from the Chinese, French, and Latin, and such cheeky sonnets as \\"The Awesome Attorneys of Oz\\" and \\"On Remembering Your Funeral Was Today\\" (\\"I bet by now that you have stolen time/To edit `The Beginner's Guide to Hell'...I see you basting in satanic slime /Before deep-frying in your cockroach shell\\"). My favorite poem in the collection--one of my favorite poems, in fact, of the past decade--is \\"Letter to Auden,\\" in which Juster attempts to bring the deceased poet up to date: \\"However, I'm delighted to report/That you became a hot pop property/When `Four Weddings' exhumed your poetry./You would have been amused to see its star/Arrested with a hooker in his car...\\" Hilarious and humane, A.M. Juster brings the pleasure principle back to poetry. \\"The Secret Language of Women\\" is a must for those who refuse to believe that formal poetry is dead.	2004-02-07

Espaillat, one of America's foremost living Formalist poets, eschews overt fireworks in her poetry. Like Vermeer--of whose paintings she has written most perceptively--Espaillat is a specialist in illuminating the quiet, everyday corners of our lives. She knows that the most quotidian things--a sign for a highway offramp, for example--can be symbolic of our deepest emotions, as in &quot;Minefields&quot;:<br />Homebound past Wallingford you'll say, again,<br />&quot;This is where Lenny lived; he died--let's see--<br />in forty-five, in Belgium; that was when<br />his jeep blew up. He was nineteen, like me.&quot;<br />Everywhere Espaillat sheds light on placid scenes and the complex life that looms just behind them.  &quot;Retriever,&quot; a winsome piece of anthropomorphism, depicts a dog philosophizing about the significance of his life. The masterful sonnet &quot;Nightline&quot; succinctly presents the horror we feel at the news of yet another high-school massacre. &quot;Paper,&quot; another fine sonnet, shows the poet discarding once-meaningful old documents &quot;that will not mean a thing to anyone.&quot; Espaillat has reached that stage in life when the process of attrition becomes inexorable; against that, she upholds her bedrock belief in beauty, sanity, and civilization. Like a lamp in the window, her poetry is a welcome beacon of hope to all of us 21st-century readers.	2004-02-07

If you are a Christian, what do you believe? There are as many different answers to this as there are Christians. Personally, I've long felt that, to call yourself a Christian, all you really need to subscribe to are the Apostles' Creed and the Ten Commandments, and even certain points within those are open to debate. (Even such a straightforward commandment as, &quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot;; does that include soldiers during wartime? Quakers, Jehovah's Witnesses and the Amish think so, but most other denominations disagree.) But as Bruce Bawer warns us, there are always those who would try to dictate what all Christians should believe, and in America today such people--as represented by what Bawer calls &quot;legalistic&quot; Christians, of the ilk of Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell and James Dobson--are in the ascendant. In &quot;Stealing Jesus,&quot; a bracing and compulsively readable book, Bawer demonstrates that fundamentalist doctrines--which its adherents claim are traditional Christianity in its purest form--in fact were not formulated until the early 19th century, or codified until publication of the Scofield Reference Bible in 1909. The Scofield Reference Bible, for those unfamiliar with it, emphasizes and annotates those portions of Scripture that fundamentalists interpret as setting forth the coming of the End Times, the Rapture and specific prescriptions for personal salvation. Those passages stressing Christ's message of love, community and selfless service to others are pointedly ignored. As Bawer sees it, the spiritual war in America is one between the Church of Law, which stresses salvation for the few true believers and damnation for everyone else, and the Church of Love, which stresses the need to follow Christ's teachings and emulate His example. Bawer shows in convincing detail that through vicious political inflghting, the Church of Law has gained such ascendancy in the U.S. today that when the mass media refer to Christianity, they always mean fundamentalism. Even worse, the agenda of the fundamentalists often has little or nothing to do with faith, and often is shockingly racist, misogynistic and homophobic. &quot;Stealing Jesus&quot; sounds an important warning to those Christians who don't want the world to think Pat Robertson speaks for them. Even more, it challenges lukewarm and devout Christians alike to think about their faiths, clarify their own beliefs and stand up for them; it may also serve to show some secular humanists that it's possible to give your heart to Jesus without sacrificing your mind.<br />As much as I admire this book, I disagree with Bawer on certain points. For example, he is comfortable with the suggestion that Jesus may not literally have been divine; here I have to agree with the fundamentalists that without the divinity of Christ, Christianity is nonsense. (This may explain why Bawer, an Episcopalian, never quotes in &quot;Stealing Jesus&quot; from C.S. Lewis, the most renowned Anglican writer of the 20th century; Lewis himself insisted that Jesus could only be either the Son of God or a liar and madman. Lewis, however, also didn't live to see the ascendancy of Robertson and Falwell, and would have been appalled at their flat denial of the worth of human logic, intellect, and imagination.) There are also times when Bawer lets his cultural prejudices show, as when he describes the congregation of an Atlanta fundamentalist church as &quot;people brought up on TV and country music.&quot; (I happen to have three close friends who by night are country musicians; by day they are a computer systems designer, a librarian at the Environmental Protection Agency, and a producer at CBS News. They are all extremely well-read, and if anything would think that Bruce Bawer is soft on Pat Robertson.) Nevertheless, Bawer's main point is undeniable for anyone for whom the spirit of Christianity is more important than its letter. It is put best in Bawer's quote from Harry Emerson Fosdick, thegreat liberal theologian of the 1920s: Speaking about fundamentalists, Fosdick said, &quot;They call God a person, and to hear them do it one would think that our psychological processes could naively be attributed to the Eternal. It is another matter altogether, understanding symbolic language, to call God personal when one means that up the roadway of goodness, truth and beauty, which outside personal experience have no significance, one must travel toward the truth about the Ultimate--&quot;beyond the comprehension of the human mind.&quot; Of course, that is vague; no idea of the Eternal which is not vague can possibly approximate the Truth.&quot;eat liberal theologian of the 1920s: Speaking about fundamentalists, Fosdick said, &quot;They call God a person, and to hear them do it one would think that our psychological processes could naively be attributed to the Eternal.

Not Beppe Severgnia, Bepe Vergnini or Betty Sevegnini, as some American utility and credit card companies would have it. The imperviousness of Americans to correct spelling is one of the things that drove Severgnini nuts during his year in Washington, D.C. as a correspondent for the Milanese newspaper Corriere della Sera. Among the other things were peanut butter;  the hostility of American drivers toward other drivers who want to enter their lane of traffic; the inability of king-size American mattresses to fit minuscule Georgetown townhouses; and waiters who are anxious to tell you their first names. \\"Ciao, America!\\" is Severgnini's witty, appreciative but far from uncritical assessment of America and the American national character, following up on a similar book he wrote about the English. Though he does get some things wrong--for example, Americans don't obey speed limits as faithfully as he thinks, and he doesn't understand that the Spam memorabilia craze is an ironic kitsch phenomenon, rather than a straightforward tribute to a beloved food--he gets a great deal startlingly right. And he's honest enough to write the following: \\"Italians don't copy the important things about America, such as patriotism, optimism, and a sense of personal responsibility. Our passion, which is shared by three-quarters of the world's population, is to imitate the superficial aspects of American life, which include vocabulary, soft drinks, jeans, hairstyles, films, and songs.\\" Tart, charming and at times unexpectedly poignant--particularly in the \\"Five Years Later\\" postscript chapter that demonstrates you can't revisit the past--\\"Ciao, America!\\" makes piquant and fascinating reading for any American. It would be great fun to read it right after finishing \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\"!	2004-01-11

Is it the birthplace of a new kind of society, one freed from the aristocratic tyranny of the past in which the right to govern comes solely from the consent of the governed, as the idealist Thomas Jefferson decreed? Or must the liberties it promises its citizens be safeguarded by a strong central government, as the realist John Adams insisted? That was the controversy that nearly swamped the fragile young nation in the 1790s, and--as Joseph Ellis demonstrates in &quot;Founding Brothers&quot;--that controversy has never really been resolved. That lack of resolution has been for both good and ill: it has made our nation a dynamic, ever-evolving entity, but it also led to the Civil War and the continuing divisions caused by racism, America's original sin. The national leaders of the 1780s and 1790s were constrained to steer the ship of state between the Scylla of dissolution and the Charybdis of slavery. By taking slavery completely off of Congress's agenda, they were able to preserve the Union, only to have the question flare into conflagration for future generations--as they well knew would happen. Whether Americans today should thank or blame them is very much a matter of personal conviction. But by taking us back to the time of Washington, Jefferson, Adams, Franklin, Madison, Hamilton and Burr, Joseph Ellis paints a convincing and often moving portrait of why these men acted as they did. These were brilliant, ambitious, contentious men, sometimes friends but more often bitter enemies, with cogent but often diametrically opposed ideas of what America should be and how it should be governed. From the tension between those men came the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the framework for a nation that still guides us today. In exhilarating and pertinent detail, Ellis shows us how these disparate personalities--each in his own way indispensable, except perhaps for Burr--shaped the nation for better or for worse. It shows how Washington, the honest broker and instinctive seeker of balance, held the nation together by sheer force of personality, and afterwards how the elegant, calm but sometimes woolly-headed Jefferson was able to gain ascendancy over the pragmatic but easily ruffled Adams. In the last chapter, it boils down to Jefferson and Adams, the intellectual yin and yang of the Revolution, whose friendship could not be destroyed even by the most savage political infighting. Ellis details elegantly the arguments they advanced in the sustained correspondence of their last years, their debate between states' rights and central government, between individual liberty and human nature still unresolved. The story of that correspondence leaves us in awe of the genius of both men, and in sorrow that their failure to resolve their differences reflected the nation's angrier, bloodier disagreements in the future.tion for better or for worse.

US	51866721	R2XD2RMHYPXPEQ	0679760806	778351106	The Master and Margarita	Books	5	59	64	N	N	A novel of breathtaking courage and imaginative depth.	\\"The Master and Margarita,\\" Mikhail Bulgakov's sparkling fantasy of Satan's visit to Moscow under the guise of a magician named Professor Woland, must rank as one of the greatest acts of literary heroism of the past century. Bulgakov wrote the novel in the late 1930s, under what was arguably the most repressive government ever on earth--the Soviet Union at the height of Stalin's power. When even the mildest criticism of the regime led to a death sentence, Bulgakov dared to place all the cruelty, venality and treachery of 1930s Russia under a microscope. The book was of course unpublishable in Bulgakov's lifetime; it only appeared in its original form nearly a half-century after the author's death. We can chuckle at the wicked tricks Woland and his retinue play on various arrogant, incompetent Soviet officials, but knowledge of the power wielded by the real-life counterparts of those officials gives the chuckles a grim undertone indeed. The titular characters don't even appear until the book is nearly half-over: the Master, a despondent writer sent to an asylum after his novel about Pontius Pilate is rejected by the Soviet writers' union, and Margarita, the beautiful woman who loves him and will literally go to Hell for his sake. Through their dealings with Woland, Bulgakov exalts the power of the imagination, the need for the spiritual dimension in life and the courage to live by one's own convictions--virtues that Stalinist Russia strove, mostly successfully, to undermine. Interspersed with the tale of Woland, the Master and Margarita are chapters from the Master's novel, depicting Pontius Pilate's dealings on the day of the Crucifixion with Yeshua Ha-Notsri (Jesus of Nazareth), Levi Matvei (St. Matthew) and Judas of Kerioth (Iscariot). The leading theme of those chapters is the essential nature of humankind: are people good, as Yeshua argues, or bad, as Pilate does? Bulgakov never answers this question, and Christian fundamentalists will be outraged to find Levi Matvei and Woland at the end to be allies, albeit uneasy ones. But in the Stalinist moral vacuum that denied the existence of both Heaven and Hell, how could they avoid working together? Bulgakov insists that people have moral choices, and that the greatest evil comes from abdicating those choices, as Stalin not only encouraged but demanded. The Vintage International edition of \\"The Master and Margarita\\" benefits mightily from the idiomatic, easily flowing English translation by Diana Burgin and Katherine Tiernan O'Connor, and the afterword by Bulgakov biographer Ellendea Proffer provides invaluable information, from the standpoint of both the societal context and Bulgakov's own life history.atvei and Woland at the end to be allies, albeit uneasy ones.

An amused and often appalled observer of the wretched excesses of TV advertising, Garfield in his new book eviscerates a number of failed campaigns with the skill of a master surgeon reviewing a botched heart transplant. The operation's not a success, Garfield points out, if the patient dies. (And sometimes the patient DOES die: an abstruse commercial for a Virginia bank, he notes, led to the failure of both the bank and the ad agency.) As Garfield sees it, the problem with much of TV advertising is simple: too many ad copywriters get caught up in the \\"creativity\\" of what they do and forget their purpose is to sell products, period. Sometimes the problem is merely a bad choice of celebrity spokesperson--say, hulking millionaire Charles Barkley pitching econobox Hyundais, or red-meat-eschewing Cybill Shepherd as national spokesperson for beef. Just as often, however, ad writers simply whiz past their target audience (the \\"Dick\\" campaign for Miller Lite) or offend viewers to the very core of their being (Ford and GM using the 9/11 tragedy as a pretext for great deals on Explorers and Grand Ams). Garfield, as always, is witty, elegant yet blunt about these failures: \\"Don't roll your eyes and dismiss the negatives,\\" he tells his readers, \\"because if you do, in due course, that's exactly what your target audience will do with you.\\" He also insists that ad writers--despite their frequent statements to the contrary--are subject to the same rules of morality, decency and civility the rest of us are. He is particularly scathing about Calvin Klein: \\"(H)e is not an advertiser. He is an arsonist...(T)o portray children as sex toys parading before adults is the line that cannot be crossed.\\" But Garfield notes that many advertisers lose sight of a basic fact: if you offend your audience, you are lost forever. The creative director of one agency once wrote Garfield to the effect that if he found TV advertising so offensive, he shouldn't watch. Garfield's reply: \\"Don't watch? Don't watch what? If advertising were programming, a viewer could make decisions about what to watch. But--I'll say this one last time--advertising isn't, so a viewer can't, so what's left to watch, if you choose not to be assaulted by advertising, is nothing. Which destroys the whole medium, you imbecile.\\" \\"And Now a Few Words from Me\\" is a fast (200 pages), trenchant, often laugh-out-loud funny look at TV advertising that deserves a readership far beyond ad agencies.

Paul Monette's \\"Becoming a Man\\" is generally considered to be the classic account of growing up gay in America. I myself, however, found much more to identify with in Bruce Bawer's \\"A Place at the Table,\\" a half-memoir, half-polemic that I think speaks for at least as many gay men as \\"Becoming a Man.\\"  Bawer, who is both openly gay and a conservative Christian, causes his coevals on both sides to swallow hard as he blasts the in-your-face outrageousness of gay radicals and the smug homophobia of right-wing fundamentalist pundits. Some have accused Bawer of sounding a little smug himself; nevertheless, it is impossible not to be moved at his insistence at being taken at face value, as a man both proudly, devoutly Christian and proudly, openly gay. Bawer is a distinguished poet and literary critic, and perhaps the best part of the book is his analysis of gay-themed novels and how they reflect on both gay and straight society. First published a decade ago, \\"A Place at the Table\\" remains a clarion call for sanity and understanding.	2003-02-16

Alice Munro is rightfully considered to be one of the greatest short-story writers in the English-speaking world. Certainly a story like \\"The Progress of Love,\\" in this volume--a rich, poignantly ironic delineation of the selectivity of memory--is proof enough that Munro is as great as her reputation would have it, and that she is one of the few living writers who deserves to be mentioned in the same sentence as Chekhov. Nevertheless, plowing through her Selected Stories is like gorging on a box of chocolates; you'd be a lot better off savoring just one or two at a time. The maiin problem is that Munro's subject range is narrow. How many stories can you read in one sitting about women from impoverished small-town Ontario, who are misunderstood and often brutalized by their families, boyfriends and husbands? (The reviewers who called Munro's women weak are misreading the stories severely; these women could have hauled the wounded Titanic to port, 2,000 passengers and all, single-handedly. They have the clemency of the very strong, which unfortunately means that weaker, more spiteful souls can walk all over them.) Yet within each story, Munro's elegant, lucid prose style and encyclopedic knowledge of the human mind and heart make themselves felt. I will reread stories such as \\"Material,\\" \\"Chaddeleys and Flemings,\\" \\"Dulse,\\" \\"The Turkey Season\\" and \\"The Beggar Maid\\" with joy and admiration for their perfect artistry. But I'll have to wait to reread stories such as \\"Labor Day Dinner,\\" which after an unrelieved diet of Munro stories can almost seem like a parody of the author. Do yourself a favor; buy this wonderful book, but savor its delights sparingly, as you would a box of Godivas.	2003-01-04

Jean-Dominique Bauby's achievement deserves to go down in history with Helen Keller's and Christy Brown's. A friend lent me her copy of &quot;The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,&quot; praising it as one of the most inspiring books she ever read. I have to admit I was halfway through the book before I overcame my horror at his predicament, and my fear of the same thing happening to me: Bauby was 43--four years younger than I am now--when he suffered his catastrophic stroke, and 45 when he died, his sophisticated, gracious mind still locked in his useless body. But by the end I was moved to tears of gratitude to see what a man could achieve when left nothing but his mind and one eyelid. Imprisoned in the wheelchair with Bauby, suffering every agony and indignity he does, we travel with him across continents, reviewing his rich and eventful life, ennobled by his determination to enjoy whatever life he has left to him, no matter what the circumstances. &quot;The Diving Bell and the Butterfly&quot; is a remarkable testament to the primacy of the human mind.	2002-11-10

As with another of my favorite books, the late Barbara Grizzuti Harrison's \\"Italian Days,\\" Carolyn See's \\"Making a Literary Life\\" is as much about the author as it is about the stated subject. See's subject, of course, is how to make your way as a writer--not only how to write, but how to get your writing published and make your name known in the literary world. Some of See's advice--such as writing a thousand words a day, five days a week--is eminently sensible; some of it--such as writing cheery thank-you notes to editors who reject your work or reviewers who trash it--is a little more difficult to swallow. But See's basic points are indisputable: the only way to be a writer is to write; the Biblical wisdom of \\"a soft answer turneth away wrath\\" holds just as true in the literary business as in any other;  being a literary genius doesn't give you leave to abandon common courtesy. Of all guides to writing, \\"Making a Literary Life\\" has to be the most flat-out fun to read. You get See's observations on the art of writing (\\"The passive voice is really good for only one thing: the weaselly notes in committee meetings where nobody wants to get blamed for whatever happened\\"). You get her first-hand testimony on the damage wrought when the people around you don't support your writing (\\"My first husband, an elegant, brokenhearted artiste, knew for a fact that if you were smart enough to want to write, you were also smart enough to realize the extent of your own mediocrity\\"). You get the scoop on the eccentric behavior of all the authors See has met, from Amy Tan carrying two lapdogs in her purse to Harlan Ellison's confrontation with a bookseller at a literary conference (\\"He howled like a castrated bison; she responded with shrieks from `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'\\"). While See says at the outset that \\"Making a Literary Life\\" is intended for fledgling writers without connections to the literary world, I think the book is just as useful for journeyman writers (such as myself) who have published a book or two but have no idea how to break into the next level.

M.A. Schaffner's novel \\"War Boys\\" is on its surface the straightforward story of Charles Barker, a boy during the Vietnam War, spending his early teen years on the Naval base at Subic Bay in the Philippines where his father is stationed. In clear and finely detailed prose, Schaffner relates the adventures of Charles and his buddies in Boy Scout Explorer Troop 360, putting themselves through various hair-raising rites of passage in the Philippine jungle, groping toward manhood in an atmosphere in which being a man means constantly having to prove yourself. It is only in the last quarter of the book that Schaffner's real purpose becomes plain. By slow degrees, Charles and his friends discover that the Navy--which represents all they know of life and the future to which they aspire--regards them not as potential recruits, but potential enemies. Schaffner is a poet as well as a novelist, and his first novel demonstrates the subtle art of a poet. It was a master stroke to show the upheavals wrought by the Vietnam War and the rise of the Youth Culture thrrough the eyes of a young boy caught between the two extremes; the resulting indirection gives the poignancy of innocence betrayed a tremendous impact at novel's end. Schaffner is an author who never raises his voice; most of the major tragedies in \\"War Boys\\" occur offstage, but are all the more powerful for that. \\"War Boys\\" is a novel that reads and feels like the ebb and flow of life; there is not a single character or event in it that feels contrived, and above all Schaffner paints a bracingly accurate portrait of what boys in their early teens actually say, do, and think. \\"War Boys\\" lacks the fireworks that would make it a bestseller, but one can see a small, devoted cult gathered round it in future years, in appreciation of its subtle artistry.	2002-09-29

The grandson of a U.S. senator, related by marriage to Jackie Kennedy Onassis, Vidal has lived all his life near this country's seats of power, and what he has to say about those seats--and the people who occupy them--has curdled the cocktails of the Capitol Hill party crowd for half a century. His animadversions against the military-industrial complex are salutary reading, no matter where you stand on the political spectrum; and as for his denunciations of the &quot;sky-godders&quot;--well, let's just say I always admire his wit and erudition, even when I want to strangle him.  I was hoping for more meat in &quot;Palimpsest,&quot; his memoir of his early life, but too much of it is just a catty settling of scores, although it's always fun to read. Here are the people he loved (Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Christopher Isherwood, Tennessee Williams, Paul Bowles, the Sitwells) and those, more vividly, whom he hated (Truman Capote, E.M. Forster, Anais Nin, and--most of all--his alcoholic, passive-aggressive mother, Nina Gore Vidal). There are fascinating anecdotes of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, the last living gasps of the ancien regime, and of the Kennedys, about whom he has a bracing ambivalence. The most poignant parts of the book deal with Jimmie Trimble, his prep-school classmate and the great love of Vidal's life, who was killed at Iwo Jima. But even this story line peters out in the constant flow of gossip, I only wonder when--or if--Vidal will publish a second volume of memoirs, dealing with the latter part of his life. Perhaps that will give us more depth.	2002-07-14

Tobias Wolff understands fully what F. Scott Fitzgerald meant when he said, &quot;Action is character.&quot; Wolff takes the reader's breath away not through twists of plot, but through his extensive knowledge of the human mind and heart, and how different minds and hearts work at cross-purposes. He knows the dirty little secret behind every human existence: because we are not each other, we betray each other. He knows why, in the title story, a woman is deeply offended by a sermon while her recovering alcoholic brother finds it completely inspiring; he knows why, in &quot;Firelight,&quot; a woman can't wait to flee an apartment she came to see about renting, while her young son wants to stay there forever. Wolff is a master at following the labyrinthine mental paths people take to justify their actions to themselves, to the point where much madness makes divinest sense. I found myself crying, &quot;Fool! Fool!&quot; at Wiley, the self-deluding, lovelorn protagonist of &quot;The Life of the Body,&quot; and my jaw dropped at the superbly ironic final sentence of &quot;The Chain,&quot; a brilliantly original variant of Patricia Highsmith's &quot;Strangers on a Train.&quot; Above all, Wolff understands the profound isolation of being a human soul trapped in an individual body; at one time or another, everyone has felt like Joyce, the main character of &quot;Migraine,&quot; that, &quot;In fact, everyone was alone all the time, but when you got sick you knew it, and that was a lot of what suffering was--knowing.&quot; These stories deserve to be anthologized forever and taught in every serious school of writing in this country.	2002-06-16

Patricia Highsmith came late to short fiction after decades of novel-writing, and Joyce Carol Oates opined in the New York Review of Books that Highsmith had little talent for the form. The stories here certainly are uneven. Stories such as \\"Blow It\\" and \\"Something the Cat Dragged In\\" seem too formulaic; \\"Old Folks at Home\\" starts from an unbelievable premise and curdles quickly from its mean-spiritedness; \\"Please Don't Shoot the Trees\\" is warmed-over Ray Bradbury; most of the \\"Little Tales of Misogyny\\" are total throwaways. Highsmith's best stories, however, are breathtaking, and put the lie to Oates' blanket condemnation. My favorite stories in this collection are \\"Not in This Life, Maybe the Next,\\" \\"The Cruelest Month\\" and \\"The Romantic,\\" all touching and perceptive portrayals of women who have lived too much in their imaginations. \\"The Pond\\" and \\"The Kite\\" are brilliant and moving fantasies of bereavement; \\"Chorus Girl's Absolutely Final Performance,\\" about the mistreatment of a zoo elephant and her final vengeance, would make stones weep. And that isn't even counting the tales of horror and suspense that were Highsmith's specialty. There are wonderful, Shirley Jacksonish tales of communities turning on their own (\\"Not One of Us,\\" \\"The Black House\\"), Hitchcockian tales of murder (\\"Slowly, Slowly in the Wind,\\" \\"A Curious Suicide,\\" \\"The Button\\"), tales of conspiracies gone awry (\\"When in Rome,\\" \\"Under a Dark Angel's Eye\\"). Highsmith's meticulous plots, wide knowledge of the world and bracingly acid view of life ensure that there are many more gems than duds in this book.	2002-03-03

Auden. Like Faulkner, Scafidi feels the ponderous weight of Southern history pressing on his shoulders; contrasting the 1916 burning of Jesse Washington with the 1998 murder of James Byrd Jr., Scafidi says, \\"Most white American men are the same color they were then.\\" But, like Auden, he is able to pass from the odium of history to take joy in the physical world. Scafidi's funny and exquisite \\"Latitudes of Desire\\" riffs brilliantly on the sight of his wife wearing only her blue panties, taking the reader on a mock-epic journey across oceans and continents in a celebration of  romantic and erotic love. Scafidi's language is labyrinthine and sensuous, a lava flow of words engulfing and preserving for all time every sight and thought in its path. Here is a young poet who writes with the delicacy and assurance of a master; I look forward to seeing what he gives us next.	2002-02-10

I had never heard of Henry Beston until a friend lent me--or, more accurately, pressed on me--his copy of The Outermost House. After reading this book, I understand his sense of urgency: this is a work of unique and lasting beauty, surely one of the greatest nature books ever written. In detailing his year in his cottage at Eastham Beach (now Coast Guard Beach) on the Atlantic side of Cape Cod, Beston combines a Thoreauvian zeal for nature and the examined life with a Proustian ability to record exactly the sight, sound, feel and scent of the world around him. Page after page is filled with unforgettable passages; his descriptions of the markings and songs of the shore birds alone are enough to move you to tears. His story of the plight of a doe caught in an icy flood is almost as suspenseful as a Hitchcock movie; his tribute to the courage of the Coast Guard &quot;surfmen&quot; who rescue shipwrecked sailors is particularly resonant to us who--after Sept. 11, 2001--have learned something about the value of those who safeguard the public. Beston is so quotable a writer that I'm shocked he's not better known. A few quotes should demonstrate:<br />  &quot;Nature is a part of our humanity, and without some awareness and experience of that divine mystery man ceases to be man.&quot;<br />  &quot;Man can be either less than man or more than man, and both are monsters, the last more dread.&quot;<br />  &quot;Poor body, time and the long years were the first tailors to teach you the merciful use of clothes! Though some scold today because you are too much seen, to my mind, you are not seen fully enough or often enough when you are beautiful.&quot;<br />  &quot;Poetry is as necessary to comprehension as science. It is as impossible to live without reverence as it is without joy.&quot;<br />  Henry Beston found urban life insupportable in the mid-1920s; who could know the dismay he would feel in 2002, when computers, television and jet planes make the world pass in a blur! Beston is out to teach us how to slow down, to learn to live again according to the patterns and rhythms of nature. For those who are willing to read and understand, The Outermost House remains a haven of peace and beauty.ut to teach us how to slow down, to learn to live again according to the patterns and rhythms of nature.

In leading Habib ben Hamed, a feckless Tunisian intellectual, to his inexorable fate during the political unrest of the 1960s, Kurata brings home two major truths: that in times of injustice, the war between conscience and personal safety is usually unwinnable; and that revolutions eat not only their young, but anyone in their paths. Kurata has been compared with Graham Greene and Albert Camus; in his detailed insight into how dictatorships work, he obviously knows his Orwell and Arthur Koestler as well. In its persuasive portrayal of the collision between modernism and traditional Islam, &quot;The Reluctant Agent&quot; is urgently pertinent reading in 2002. The deceptively simple yet compelling story keeps you turning the pages to the final paragraph, which is breathtaking in its lethal spareness. &quot;The Reluctant Agent&quot; is a must-read for anyone interested in the literature of revolution and politics.	2002-01-12

We read with the eyes alone, not with the imagination.&quot; Thus speaks Mr. Cardan, a character in Aldous Huxley's &quot;Those Barren Leaves,&quot; and all I can say in reply is, &quot;Mea culpa, mea maxima culpa.&quot; Wanting to rush into the plot, I found myself annoyed with Huxley's slow, careful unfolding of the characters--the upper-class English guests at the Tuscan castle of the pretentious, amorous Mrs. Aldwinkle--and their long-winded conversations about Balzac and Diderot. I started to agree with Elizabeth Bowen's comment that Huxley was &quot;the stupid person's idea of the clever person.&quot; After I had slowed down, however, and started to really read Huxley's painstaking dialogue and careful descriptions of the Italian countryside, I began to appreciate his brilliant evisceration of the motley crew around the impossible Mrs. Aldwinkle: Mr. Cardan, the Epicurean philosopher; Calamy, the amorist who is beginning to wonder if there is more to life than bedding women; Mary Thriplow, the novelist who never stops writing, even when making love; Chelifer, the disillusioned poet; and the hapless Grace Elver, a sort of female Forrest Gump without Forrest's lucky star. This wickedly funny yet meditative book repays the work of thoughtful readers, it has much to say about what is really important in life, and how expert people are at self-delusion. People who liked &quot;My Dinner with Andre&quot; or Robertson Davies' Cornish Trilogy should like &quot;Those Barren Leaves.&quot;	2001-12-08

John Haines has often quoted the novelist Hermann Broch: &quot;Political indifference is ethical indifference.&quot; Haines adds that soon it becomes esthetic indifference as well. &quot;For the Century's End,&quot; Haines's latest book, contains poems that are exemplary of political, ethical and esthetic commitment. Poems such as &quot;Blood,&quot; &quot;Politics and the Dead,&quot; and &quot;Kent State, 1970&quot; show a meticulous attention to craft, a deep, melancholy sense of history, and an abiding sympathy and outrage on behalf of history's victims. In poems such as &quot;In the House of Wax,&quot; he creates grim historic panoramas in the sparest of words: &quot;Crowned heads and axes fall,/thugs and jailors rise/and displace each other/in this long, uneasy walk/we have littered/with claims and captions.&quot; Not many contemporary poems can claim to be &quot;important&quot;--i.e. to combine excellence of phrase and image with urgency of message.

In his will, the medieval Tuscan merchant Francesco di Marco Datini ordered that all his account books and correspondence be gathered together and stored for posterity. These archives were lost soon after Datini died in 1410, but found again, remarkably intact, in 1870. These archives, constituting nearly 140,000 letters to and from Datini and 503 files of business documents, constitute the most complete record of medieval Italian life ever found. Iris Origo mined this treasure trove for all it was worth in &quot;The Merchant of Prato,&quot; creating a fascinatingly detailed portrait of how people lived, what they ate, and what they thought in late-14th-century Tuscany. Because Datini was a merchant, his ledgers provide an intimate account of what goods were available to affluent Italians of his time, and in what quantity. Even more fascinating than the details of family life are Origo's reconstruction of the lives and personalities of her three central characters: Datini himself, his young wife Margherita, and his best friend Ser Lapo Mazzei. &quot;Certainly he was a difficult man, either to serve or love,&quot; Origo says of Datini, and indeed it is a difficult character Datini presents to us through his letters: grasping, imperious, sharp-tongued, morbidly suspicious--in short a model of a self-made tycoon in any age. But a better side of Datini is shown in his correspondence with the spirited, outspoken Margherita--who could give as good as she got--and with the kindly, philosophical Lapo Mazzei. Mazzei--who founded a winemaking dynasty that continues to this day, and whose distant descendant Filippo Mazzei was a close friend of Thomas Jefferson--was constantly reminding Datini of his duties as a Christian, and at length succeeded in persuading him to leave the bulk of his vast fortune to the poor. The foundation for the poor created by Datini's will continues in Prato to this day. Origo recreates Datini and Mazzei as characters of Dickensian richness, with Mazzei--if you will--playing the Ghost of Christmas Present to Datini's Scrooge. This book is a masterpiece, and how it could be allowed to fall out of print is a mystery to me. It should be reprinted in a new edition as soon as possible.ei--if you will--playing the Ghost of Christmas Present to Datini's Scrooge.

O'Donnell tracked down all the surviving denizens of the Fuehrerbunker to provide an exciting, minutely detailed portrait of the collapse of the Third Reich and the final madness and suicide of Hitler. It is to O'Donnell's credit that the narrative doesn't end with Hitler's death, but continues in its final third to describe the hideous blood-madness of Joseph and Magda Goebbels, who slaughtered their six children before ending their own lives; to trace the real fate of Martin Bormann; and to detail the desperate (and only partly successful) attempts of Hitler's surviving minions to escape capture, rape and torture at the hands of the Red Army. These stories are just as fascinating as those of the Fuehrer himself.  There are amazing stories within the story, such as that of &quot;Mata O'Hara,&quot; the glamorous Irish spy (whose true identity is still unknown) who learned the Fuehrer's deepest secrets through becoming the mistress of SS General Fegelein, Eva Braun's drunken, cowardly brother-in-law. The great virtue of this book--and why it makes such addictive, suspenseful  reading--is that O'Donnell never forgets these people, even Hitler, are human beings, however great his horror at the unimaginable evils they perpetrated. Perhaps he goes too easy on some of them, particularly Albert Speer. But he actually makes us care about their fates, and above all he reminds us that because it was human beings who committed these atrocities, we are not safe from their kind in the future, or even from becoming their kind. I don't understand why this book has become so obscure. It's true that, because he wrote in 1978, O'Donnell couldn't benefit from the revelations about Red Army investigations and the fate of Hitler's corpse that came out after the collapse of the Soviet Union. But the book still offers many valuable insights into the final days of the Nazi high command, as well as simply being a smashing good read.ply being a smashing good read.	2001-08-11

There were certain passages of The Mill on the Floss, Proust once told a friend, that never failed to move him to tears. No wonder: In its exact and evocative attention to detail, vivid characterizations and profound understanding of human thought and motive, The Mill on the Floss had an obvious and startling influence on A' La Recherche du Temps Perdu. The Mill on the Floss is melodramatic, sure, but melodrama was the bread and butter of Victorian English novelists; compared with David Copperfield, for example, The Mill on the Floss is a model of restraint. George Eliot creates here an indelible portrait of  St. Ogg's, an English provincial town whose residents lead lives &quot;irradiated by no sublime principles, no romantic visions, no active, self-renouncing faith.&quot; In particular, she creates Maggie Tulliver, one of the most memorable characters in all literature, whose quest for sublime principles and romantic visions puts her into direct conflict with her neighbors and with Tom, her stubborn, unimaginative brother. The book's tragic ending is superbly haunting, and has helped to make it a deserved favorite of readers for nearly 150 years.	2001-08-04

In a 100-page, multi-sectioned poem,  Hilary Tham takes us across her amazing life's journey, beginning with her impoverished Chinese-Malaysian girlhood, through her marriage to an American Peace Corps worker, her conversion to his religion (Judaism), and her travels around the world. She gives us the rich particulars of her life, talking of parents, siblings, husband, daughters, the deaths of family and friends; yet her authorial &quot;I&quot; is all-encompassing, far too generous and thoughtful for self-pity or narrow self-regard. As with Emily Dickinson, Hilary Tham's business is &quot;circumference&quot;--comprehending and embracing the entire world through the eye of a poet. She sees the bad, but believes the good is stronger, and loves the world for its contradictions. The final section of the book, &quot;Blessings,&quot; is perhaps the best, combining Tham's deep religious feelings with her wholehearted celebration of the things of this world.

John Haines ranks with Thoreau, Emily Dickinson and Robinson Jeffers as one of the great solitaries of American literature. Whether he writes about hunting for moose near his Alaskan homestead or the paintings of Hieronymus Bosch, Haines remains true to his basic theme: that each of us is alone in the world, with only the examples presented by nature and art to guide us. If we are to survive, we must constantly use our minds and hearts to draw whatever wisdom we can from our experience, and make whatever accommodations we can to people and places beyond the narrow confines of our lives. He does not ask us to share his solitude so much as he tries to make us realize our own, and to help us find sustenance based on that knowledge. Haines' style--laconic, short-lined, plain but never easy--is among the most distinguished of any living poet. There are few contemporary poems, for example, as haunting as his &quot;Rain Country&quot;:  &quot;All that we loved: a fire/ long dampened, the quenched/whispering down of faded/straw and yellowing leaves.//The names and the voices/within them, speak now/  for the slow rust of things/ that are muttered in sleep.&quot; The paperback edition of &quot;The Owl in the Mask of the Dreamer&quot; contains more than twenty poems--mostly uncollected work from the 1960s--which do not appear in the hardcover version. This automatically makes it the better buy. John Haines has studiously avoided both the limelight and the tenure track, and thus has shunned the sort of lionization John Ashbery could not live without. But he is known and cherished by those readers who still believe that poetry can exhibit something akin to moral and intellectual force. It is, at the very least, an even trade.	2001-05-15

More than any other poet I know, Jeffrey McDaniel proves that the phrase &quot;good slam poetry&quot; is NOT an oxymoron.

Yet his work also has a deep underlying seriousness, a disgust with the absurdity and petty cruelty of daily existence, which keeps it from being merely clever. If you are interested in getting acquainted with the best of America's younger poets, and if you like Beat poetry with a rock'n'roll edge, Jeff McDaniel's work is an excellent place to start.	2001-05-08

The film version of &quot;Before Night Falls&quot; doesn't contain a fraction of the incident in Reinaldo Arenas' actual book. Most filmgoers will be grateful for this, for most of what happened to Arenas would be unbearable to watch on film. Here was a man--a courageous man, a true artist and a genius--who NEVER got a break in life, from the poverty of his birth to his persecution as a young man to the horrible illness that cut him down at 47. Even now, people find it hard to fit Arenas into their comfortable little molds. He was a total maverick who insisted on the utter freedom of the individual, to a point even Ayn Rand might have considered excessive. Arenas was just as appalled by the avarice masquerading as virtue that occurs so often in capitalism as he was by the bloodthirstiness masquerading as virtue which has typified Castro's Cuba and other Communist dictatorships. The tale of his sufferings in Castro's prisons is horrifying, and it is scarcely less appalling to learn that the Western publishers who grew rich from his novels refused to pay him royalties after he had escaped to America.  He was only happy when seeking out sexual partners--which eventually he had in the thousands--and that automatically made him unacceptable to many who otherwise would have claimed him as a brother in ideology. Readers of &quot;Before Night Falls&quot; are as likely to be outraged by Arenas' own actions as by what was done to Arenas; and yet they will finish the book filled with admiration, love, and pity for a man who was, in every way that counts, a true hero. I was one of those who believed that the embargo of Cuba wasn't working, and should be abandoned; after reading Reinaldo Arenas' story, however, I'm not so smugly certain about that any more.	2001-04-14

Willa Cather, a friend and protege of Sarah Orne Jewett, ranked The Country of the Pointed Firs along with Huckleberry Finn and The Scarlet Letter as the American work of fiction most likely to be acknowledged by posterity as an immortal masterpiece. While readers can easily quibble with Cather's top choices, it is easy to see that The Country of the Pointed Firs is a masterpiece--though perhaps not one for every taste. The leisurely, closely detailed novella has an unnamed narrator who describes her two summers living among the kindly, easygoing residents of Dunnett's Landing, a seaside town in Maine. It begins with an offstage funeral and ends with an offstage wedding, and very little in the conventional sense happens in the book--herb gathering, visits to neighbors, a reunion of mostly elderly family members. Very little happens--and yet the reader gets an overwhelming sense of the ties of love and gratitude that bind people on earth, as well as a keen, poignant apprehension of the passage of time and the finiteness of existence. It is somewhat reminiscent of &quot;Our Town,&quot; but The Country of the Pointed Firs is the more profound work of art. This meditative little book could probably not be appreciated fully by any reader under the age of 40. Yet for the right kind of reader, it has a power and poignancy that outstrips its minuscule size.	2001-03-18

What was really important to me about Thurber was that he came from the same part of Ohio that I did, and actually had had relatives and attended family reunions in Sugar Grove, Ohio, where I grew up. That meant all the world to me, because it showed me that someone who had ties to Sugar Grove could be a famous writer. Now, I love Thurber's work more than ever; as an adult, I can better appreciate the nuances of a story like &quot;The Catbird Seat.&quot; Thurber's work is a precise, funny, yet deeply serious portrait of an America which had just recently completed the transition from a frontier to an urban society. Women, having just won the right to vote, were flexing new-found muscles; men, divorced from the need to wrest a living from the soil, felt suddenly unmoored and emasculated; a new breed of self-help authors arose to make a quick buck from the newly uncertain populace;  and oceans of alcohol fueled the newly stirred resentments between the sexes.Thurber recorded it all, in a prose style as elegant and lucid as any in the history of American literature. &quot;The Catbird Seat,&quot; &quot;Fables for Our Time&quot; and the self-help parodies of &quot;Let Your Mind Alone!&quot; are every bit as fresh and pertinent as when Thurber wrote them 60-odd years ago. Unfortunately, some aspects of his work--most glaringly his portrayal of African-Americans--have not stood up so well. But one can only say of Thurber what the Duc de Saint-Simon said of Louis XIV: &quot;His virtues were his own, his faults were his times'.&quot; The best of James Thurber ranks with the best of Mark Twain, Ring Lardner, Woody Allen and any other American humorist you can name.	2001-03-16

The middle novel, What's Bred in the Bone, is the lynchpin of the trilogy--the &quot;biography&quot; of Francis Cornish, a wealthy art collector and restorer who in time will be suspected of being an art forger, but who in reality is a great artist of high inward purpose. To remind us of Mark Twain's dictum that a man's true biography is what goes on in his own mind, the book is narrated by the two invisible spirits who served as Cornish's guardians on Earth--the only ones who will ever know the whole truth about him. What's Bred in the Bone is sandwiched in between The Rebel Angels, about mayhem and skulduggery among a group of academics when they inherit the bountiful legacy of the late Francis Cornish, and The Lyre of Orpheus, concerning the convoluted doings when a young musical genius tries to recreate an unfinished opera by E.T.A. Hoffmann. This book features a particularly rollicking gang of characters, including E.T.A. Hoffmann himself speaking from the grave. Davies' style glistens with his trademark scholarship and wit; his Jungian philosophy, deep spirituality and often profound insights into the artistic process make these novels important works of art as well as delightful semi-satiric, semi-fantasy romps. One major complaint I have about Davies is that all his characters tend to sound like erudite, well-settled, middle-aged men--fine for the Rev. Simon Darcourt, but not for Maria Theotoky Cornish, the 23-year-old, half-Gypsy beauty. Also, some of his set pieces simply go on too long, such as the contentious &quot;Arthurian&quot; dinner party thrown by Arthur and Maria Cornish. However, the totality of Davies' gifts is so enormous that I'm willing to forgive him his flaws.m his flaws.	2001-02-25
US	51866721	RCN1A910E5V5Y	1579620426	453209505	Serendipity Green	Books	4	2	3	N	Y	A witty, imaginative, enjoyable satirical romp.	A pinch of Sinclair Lewis, a dash of Garrison Keillor, garnishes of Thurber and Twain and Dave Barry, with just a hint of Swift and Waugh: that is the recipe that Rob Levandoski concocts in Serendipity Green, and it is as darkly delicious as devil's food. Levandoski is shrewdly observant as to how tempests brew quickly in small-town teapots; he also is in touch with the need of Americans to follow the latest trend, even if it's a particularly ugly, bilious shade of green, and to believe in their own myths, even if they are patently untrue tales of an Indian maiden whose name is Polish for &quot;nonsense.&quot;  There are characters here as rich as any in recent fiction, including D. William Aitchbone, a consummate schemer on a par with Anthony Trollope's Mr. Slope, and the odd couple of Howie Dornick and Katherine Hardihood, two painfully plain middle-aged wallflowers who find each other through their mutual loathing of D. William Aitchbone. Levandoski's invention is prodigious, indeed to his detriment: he introduces so many characters and subplots that he has to scramble madly to resolve them all. The end, as a result, seems rushed and not quite all it could be. Up to that point, however, the book is a delight, and Serendipity Green is still must reading for anyone who likes a good, funny book that is ever so lightly tinged with arsenic.	2001-01-26

As with the exquisite cinematic oeuvre of Edward D. Wood Jr., the poetic works of the Victorian Scottish poet William McGonagall rate one star for quality, five for entertainment value. McGonagall is a singularly sympathetic and touching figure: this brave, honest, God-fearing man suffered poverty, hardship and ridicule, sacrificing everything for his poetry, which was absolutely...abominable. A quotation from one of his poems--about the disastrous collapse of a railway bridge--will suffice to give the flavor of his work: Beautiful railway bridge over the silv'ry Tay!/I must now conclude my lay/By stating here fearlessly without the least dismay/That your girders would not have given way,/At least many sensible men do say,/If they had been reinforced with buttresses,/At least many sensible men confesses,/For the stronger we our houses do build,/The less chance we have of being killed. The pastor of McGonagall's church, reading McGonagall's tribute to him, said, &quot;Shakespeare never wrote anything like this.&quot; Indeed not, and English poetry would be much the lesser if it had no room for gallant eccentrics like McGonagall.	2001-01-14

Annie Proulx is an expert on the extremes of both human and meterological behavior; she knows how weather and topography can both kill people physically and warp them mentally. The stories in &quot;Close Range&quot; demonstrate, in finely honed sentences that sting like scorpions' tails, the danger of living in an unforgiving landscape and of trying to deny the power of land and weather.  &quot;The Half-Skinned Steer&quot; is a brilliant, semi-surreal parable of an old man who thinks he has risen above his roots; &quot;The Mud Below&quot; is a remarkable character study, finding deep sympathy for a young bullrider who is slowly, shockingly  revealed to be pathological. My own favorite is the final story, &quot;Brokeback Mountain,&quot; perhaps the saddest, most moving love story ever written. Be warned that Annie Proulx does not write for sentimentalists; she is even more ruthless than Larry McMurtry in sacrificing lovable characters, probing the stupidity and meanness of humanity, and above all depicting the sheer pitilessness of the Western landscape. But for those who come prepared, she will take your breath away. The hardcover version is worth buying for the masterful illustrations of William Matthews, which depict the Wyoming mountains as Edward Hopper might have painted them.	2000-12-11

It took Patricia Garfinkel many years to bring herself to write these terse, painful, brilliant poems, and after reading &quot;Making the Skeleton Dance,&quot; you will see why. Garfinkel takes the twin skeletons of her family history--childhood sexual abuse at the hands of her grandfather, and her uncle and parents' careers as the legal mouthpieces for the psychotic mobster Dutch Schultz--and sends them on a sad but courageous verbal ballet. These are poems that don't flinch from anything; when you read of Dutch beating and torturing an enemy to death, then &quot;pass(ing) around a glass of warm blood/to quench the thirst to tell,&quot; you know you are reading poems of truth and power.	2000-12-03

We've had many books from authors who grew up as the children of difficult, self-obsessed geniuses, but Christopher Dickey's memoir of his father, James Dickey, ranks at the very top. &quot;Summer of Deliverance&quot; has the ring of bitter truth, and Christopher Dickey is just as hard on himself as he is on his father; this isn't &quot;Daddy Dearest,&quot; thank God. The chapters on the making of the film version of &quot;Deliverance&quot;--an abortive collaboration between father and son which ended when the father died--are both hair-raising and delicious. (I'm surprised Burt Reynolds hasn't sued!) &quot;Summer of Deliverance&quot; had the effect on me of making me want to go back and reread all of James Dickey's poems and novels immediately, as well as to check out Christopher Dickey's other books. I suspect most readers will have exactly the same reaction.	2000-12-03

Celia Brown, in her first book of poetry, shows the Irish gift of using common words as if they were newly minted, leading us to a fresh reconsideration of their sound and meaning. When Brown writes of cows &quot;knee deep in May with grassy June before them,&quot; or of a lake near her childhood home being &quot;three hearts of water,/a stem of land afloat/in the tweed of fields,&quot; we know we are in the presence of a poet who can refresh our perception of the world. &quot;Mending the Skies&quot; takes us through Brown's life story, from childhood by Galway Bay, to nurse's training in England, to marriage and emigration to the U.S., where she now lives by another famous bay--Cape Cod. Her poems mingle an exquisite poetic sensibility with tough common sense and a sometimes bawdy sense of humor. To read them is to be left in no doubt that she belongs to the grand tradition of Irish poets.	2000-11-05

Pablo Medina, an exile from Cuba, brings a solid knowledge of history and politics, a wide-ranging imagination and a deep understanding of the human heart to his second novel, &quot;The Return of Felix Nogara.&quot; The title character is a rootless fifty-year-old man returning to his island homeland of Barata (a thinly disguised Cuba) after 38 years in exile. Nicolas Campion, the feared dictator of Barata, has recently died, and exiles are flocking back to the island, hoping to regain what they lost when they fled. The only things Felix Nogara hopes for are a reunion with his long-lost mother and a sense of closure with his past. Unfortunately, he discovers there can never be any closure with a country in which there is no difference between past and present--only a change in the names of dictators and revolutionaries. Pablo Medina knows well what exile does to the human spirit--both good and bad--and the history he has invented for Barata, while fantastic and outrageous, is grounded in a thorough understanding of both Cuban history and basic human nature. His writing is lean and elegant, his storytelling full of astute and satisfying surprises. Most of all, he makes you care very much about Felix Nogara and the people of Barata--a people who, though they prefer romantic illusions to truth, nevertheless have learned to endure whatever Fate throws at them, and thrive in spite of it. In its combination of magic realism, bawdy black humor and high moral seriousness, &quot;The Return of Felix Nogara&quot; combines the best of Gabriel Garcia Marquez with the best of Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh.	2000-11-02

If you've ever said, &quot;Take off, hosers!&quot; to your friends, or caught yourself humming the tune of &quot;Who Made the Egg Salad Sandwiches?&quot; or had a hankering for Mrs. Vilve Yachke's cabbage rolls and coffee, this book is for you. SCTV was, for my money, the best comedy sketch program ever, combining the hip irreverence of Saturday Night Live with the conceptual brilliance of Monty Python's Flying Circus, and featuring a cast so excellent that my favorite performer on the show was whoever I happened to be watching at the time. Dave Thomas, a cast member and head writer of the show, provides invaluable commentary on its  the backstage operations and the sometimes less-than-amicable relations between cast members. The book is a great read for anyone who loved the show. One of the most refreshing things about it is Thomas's friendly, unpretentious, self-deprecating narration--even when he's admitting to being a jealous, angry, overambitious jerk!	2000-11-01

What Margaret Atwood does here is the equivalent of doing a jigsaw puzzle--or, more to the point, fashioning a mosaic--while walking across Niagara Falls on a tightrope. Without a single misstep, she takes the reader back and forth between newspaper articles, an erotic and fanciful novel-within-a-novel, and an old lady's final memoirs to tell the mysterious, haunting story of the Chase sisters, Iris and Laura. The structure--despite the constantly shifting viewpoint--is rock-solid, the writing precise and poetic; Atwood hammers in the final piece of the mosaic--at which point, and only then, the final picture becomes clear--with an almost audible sigh of satisfaction at a job well done. &quot;The Blind Assassin'' is a model of the novelist's craft, combining the propulsive, page-turning pleasure of any bestseller with the moral seriousness and attention to language that readers demand of high art.	2000-10-29

Osbert Sitwell, in many ways, could be considered a dreadful man: irascible and litigious, snobbish and bigoted, a W.C. Fieldsian hater of dogs and kids, even a sometime admirer of Italian Fascism. Philip Ziegler's biography notes Sitwell's glaring faults, but also his shining virtues, so that in the end Sitwell appears  profoundly sympathetic, even lovable. He was accused throughout his life of being an aristocratic dilettante, yet in the end he produced more than 50 books, including some of the most vivid memoirs and art criticism of any English author. He was notably quarrelsome--as were his siblings Edith and Sacheverell--yet to family and friends he showed touching loyalty and generosity. Osbert Sitwell was one of the biggest fish in the big pond that was English literary society between the wars, and Ziegler does a brilliant job not only of portraying that society but of delineating Sitwell's significance in it--both as an individual and as a member of the brilliant, outrageous Sitwell family.	2000-10-01

The title character, a naive,  self-satisfied young Methodist minister, is a cautionary figure for us all;  introduced tentatively to a world of sophistication, he loses faith in all  the old verities of his life, with nothing but a few poses and attitudes to  replace them. Even at the end, trying to make a new start, his  self-delusion is breathtaking. Harold Frederic had the misfortune to die at  42, just as he was starting to hit his stride as a novelist. Had he lived  to write even another 10 years, he might be a household name today.	2000-08-26

There are so  many powerful events in this book--the sad, truncated romance of Bushrod  Carter and Anna Hereford, the Satanic evil of Simon Rope, the travails of  Nebo Gloster (best described as Forrest Gump minus the sentimentality) or  the fragile intellectual Calvin Jones. Once read, this book can never be  forgotten, and it will come back to you again and again, to haunt and move  you.	2000-08-26

Reading &quot;Town Smokes,&quot; you close  the covers gasping for air, yet wanting desperately to return. Judging from  this, his first book, Pinckney Benedict appeared to be well on his way  toward becoming one of the great figures of American literature, the equal  of Faulkner or Melville. Unfortunately, &quot;The Wrecking Yard,&quot; his  follow-up book, was very fine, but lacked the originality and power of  &quot;Town Smokes.&quot; I fear Benedict's M.F.A. advisors may have gotten  to him!	2000-08-26

When you pick up a copy of Please, Lord, Make Me a Famous Poet or At Least Less Fat, you get 402 pages of peerless wit  and erudition. Blehert knows just about everything there is to know about  poetry in the English language, and nearly all of his knowledge is  displayed in this book, in his characteristic melange of parody, punning  and reasoned discourse. Some people may dismiss Blehert as a show-off, or  as merely clever. But most, I think, will respond to his expansive good  humor, and to the book's undercurrent of serious, even moral, commentary on  what poetry should be and do.	2000-06-29

For most of the past century, there have been two schools of thought about Hitler and Stalin. One states that Stalin wasn't really so bad, because he fought the Fascists; the other insists that Hitler wasn't really so bad,  because he fought the Communists. Alan Bullock leaves both viewpoints in  the dustheap of history, where they belong. Both Hitler and Stalin came as  close to pure evil as human beings ever get; both stood for the utter  repression of the human spirit and the annihilation of anyone who might  possibly be suspected of standing in their way. Bullock demonstrates this  in exhaustive, but never exhausting, detail. More people should read this  book, if only to be cured forever of any temptation to support any form of  totalitarianism, any time, anywhere.	2000-06-18

Frankly, I regard &quot;Fifth Business&quot; as the best book I have ever read, of any sort. Never have I read a book as fresh, as inventive, as rich in creating its own world, its own spell. &quot;The Manticore&quot; and  &quot;World of Wonders&quot; suffer slightly in comparison, but still the  trilogy ranks as a high point of imaginative literature in the English  language in the 20th century. Never will I forget Dunstan Ramsay's  obsession with saints, or with Mary Dempster, to his mind the most perfect  of saints; never will I forget the story of how Paul Dempster, uneducated  carny and abused child, was tempered like a bottle in the smoke to become  Magnus Eisengrim, the magnificent, the nonpareil.

While any study of a private friendship--even one of two such public men as Hemingway and Fitzgerald--must necessarily contain a good deal of speculation, Scott Donaldson's speculations always sound just and  reasonable. He relies on the considerable documentary evidence left by both  men and their numerous friends, and the dual portrait he paints is  convincing. Much of what he presented was quite new to me--such as the  considerable editorial assistance Fitzgerald gave Hemingway on &quot;The  Sun Also Rises,&quot; or the quasi-Lesbian relationship between Hemingway's  mother and a much younger woman. This book is a must for anyone who cares  about Hemingway and Fitzgerald, and who believes that, in the end, the work  was more important than the men. It isn't the only Fitzgerald or Hemingway  biography you'll ever need, but it stands as an important supplement to the  other books, and as a valuable key to understanding both men and why they  wrote what they wrote.	2000-06-17

His ear for dialogue is flawless, as is  his eye for how people try and fail to connect.  Here is an author who  knows how to create characters who live and breathe--characters who  sometimes appall us with their behavior, but who always keep our sympathy  and understanding.

Reading the story of John Money, David Reimer and the fateful, horrifying way in which their lives intersected is like reading two different Greek tragedies at once. On one hand, you have John Money, a man of  unquestionable brilliance and attainment, brought low like Oedipus or Creon  through hubris. Blinded by his own arrogance, Money ruins the life of an  innocent child--forcing the young boy into a gender change the boy neither  wants nor needs--and ends up with his own reputation in ruins, the living  symbol of science run amok. As for David Reimer, he is the innocent victim  tortured by the gods (in this case, the gods of science) for reasons he  cannot know, but who in the end triumphs to reclaim his true identity and  place in the world. David and his family, perhaps, are more like Biblical  characters--modern-day Jobs brought to the brink of destruction, and  rescued virtually at the last minute. In any case, you will be filled with  sympathy, admiration, and affection for David, his parents Ron and Janet,  and his brother Brian, and end up praying for their happy, peaceful lives,  far away from the people who hurt them.	2000-06-17

Espaillat's &quot;Where Horizons Go&quot; is for readers who look for poetry  to curl up with on a rainy day with a pot of tea. Espaillat's exquisitely crafted, polished formal verse never raises its voice, but  speaks in the quiet, conversational tone of a wise but self-deprecating  best friend. &quot;Sixty-Five&quot; demonstrates her rueful humor: &quot;My  body hates me. And it's mutual, too./ We never speak these days except to  fight./ There's less and less I like it still can do./ My bladder yells at  me; my clothes are tight.&quot; Every poem in the collection is a gentle  gem, the work of a poet who has experienced much, but has never wavered in  her bedrock belief in order, reason, and civilization.  When her grandson  Evan accuses her of being &quot;too tidy,&quot; she replies, &quot;True,  tidy seldom goes where genius goes,/But then how many do?&quot; She  delights in the work of artists who illuminate everyday life, like Vermeer,  &quot;whose people, drenched in light, like honey, wear/the blessing of the  hive.&quot;  To read &quot;Where Horizons Go&quot; is to enter into a world  where the everyday is infused with quiet magic; to reread it is like  meeting a beloved old friend on the street. At the end of  &quot;Rachmaninoff on the Mass Pike,&quot; Espaillat says, &quot;All the  heart wants is to be called again.&quot; Her poetry calls to readers'  hearts, with modest but masterful authority.	1999-02-04
