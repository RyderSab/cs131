It is not often that a book completely engrosses me, but this one has. I loved the beautiful narration of this story, the shifting perspective, and finally, the unknown outcome. For fear of giving too much away, I will not discuss the plot, but will say that it has all the appeal of a modern page-turner, combined with the atmosphere of a literary classic. Pick this one up today! I highly recommend this book!	2005-10-10
US	24295389	R1HLSY8TUHL2CT	1400031656	867047226	Before You Know Kindness	Books	4	5	5	N	N	well crafted family drama	What happens when a tragic accident rips apart not just a man's shoulder but an entire family? Can people forgive those whose actions lead to needless suffering? Can they forgive themselves for their own weaknesses and shortcomings? Bohjalian has addressed all these questions with such poignancy that they reader cannot help but reflect on his or her own life and circumstances. This novel starts as a page turner, but evolves into a slow and meditative study of human behavior. Each character is so well developed that by the end, you feel as if you know them and care about what happens in their futures. Though there is no real \\"mystery\\" here, as implied by the back cover, there is something very worthwhile. Definitely worth picking up.	2005-10-02

While Eudora Welty is clearly a gifted writer -- she is able to create lines that are rich with imagery and meaning -- she struggles to write at a pace that engages the reader, at least in my opinion. While I was pulled in for the first 50 pages or so, I quickly lost interest. This is a novel that is light on plot, heavy in meaning, which is great; I do not have a problem with that. Unfortunately, I think this book is too short and does not give enough information about the characters to make the deeper context very significant. I found myself reading that last few pages thinking, \\"Okay, I'm supposed to care here. I'm supposed to feel that this character has changed, has realized how his/her life has evolved to this point...\\" I just didn't care enough. I feel that this book probably works for Southern readers who might connect with the geography, the people, the culture of the Gulf Coast. As a Californian, perhaps, these things are just lost on me. Perhaps my faster-paced, doing-three-things-at-once sort of lifestyle prevents me from feeling the patience to get through this type of book.	2005-09-10

He is able to capture a mood, a tention and an empathy for his main character, Mr. Rath, that many authors simply can't.  I found myself able to identify with this man (who is my age, 33, though male) so closely it was creepy. He is like me in his tendency to worry so much about the \\"what if's\\" in life, that sometimes he doesn't take the risks that maybe he should. Or, if he does take the risks, he is so nervous that everything will fall apart, he can't truly enjoy it. I found myself rooting for him, and feeling his anxiety at every work conference or family incident. I was glad when the story ended, and that it ended as it did, because I don't know if I could have taken any more stress. This book DID stress me out because it is so true, then as well as now. Definitely worth reading.	2005-08-30

It does, however, have a quality about it that somehow make you feel slightly better about your life. It is very much in the vein of Breakfast Club, as another reviewer mentioned, and if you liked that movie, like I did as a child of the 80s, then you will most likely enjoy this book too. The story is just as improbable, but if you are able to suspend disbelief and accept the fact that these friendships (or whatever these odd relationships may be) would never exist in real life, then you will be able to buy in, and find something likable and all-too-human in these four people. I found myself wanting to stop what I was doing in the middle of the day and escape into Hornby's world for an hour or two. I would consider picking up another of Hornby's books for his unique way of finding humor in unlikely situations and developing characters that matter... at least for a while. Worth picking up.	2005-08-24

While reading the first 50 pages or so of this one, I felt like I was reading a book for women about twenty years older than me. I felt totally disengaged, bored. The writing didn't seem to connect with me, a reader in my early thirties. The dialogue between the main character Jo and her minister husband seemed so stilted and pretentious, arguing, for example, whether the feeling she was having was \\"admonitory\\" or \\"premonitory.\\" Come on, I thought, no one talks like this! I did become more interested in the story when it shifted back to her wild, hippy days living in a commune-style house while on a break from her dull, married life. Again, the ridiculous vocabulary worked its way into her characters' lines, though, which just seemed like it was used to show how smart Miller is. It just didn't ring true at all and was very distracting from the story itself. I did find myself caring about the characters and thinking about them throughout the day when I wasn't reading. The ending was disappointing and unsatisfying. While I normally like things unresolved at the end of books, this ending just seemed like a cop out. Too simple, too... I don't know what. Just not what I was hoping for. Overall, not bad, but certainly a far cry from \\"good.\\"	2005-08-04

I did have a few minor problems with certain aspects of the novel, like how he KNEW the exact year of his death, but I was able to completely buy into this seemingly improbable tale of a life in reverse. The characters were all so memorable, the feelings of love, regret, frustration and everything else, quite real.  It really makes you think about what you would do for love, the sacrifices you'd be willing to make, the friendships you'd be willing to relinquish. Also, what if you could meet that lost love again later in life and become someone totally different? Would you lie to the one you love in order to build a new life with them? Oh, the possibilities! I highly recommend this book to anyone. I think you'd have to be completely void of a heart not to be touched by this novel.	2005-07-28

I couldn't resist, though, when it appeared on the discount table at Borders. I ended up reading this book in a day and a half. Lively tellls this story through chapters told from various characters' points of view. I was surprised at just how emotionally involved I became with each of these characters and their individual pursuits of love and happiness. I also liked the fact the reader does not learn the details of Kath's untimely death until nearly the very end. It helped to keep me interested and wanting to read more and more. I think most readers will find this book rewarding. A good one to talk about with your friends.	2005-07-22

This book shared a lot of similarities but was definitely more rough, less refined. His style of shifting time periods and narrators, which worked so well in his other novel, just didn't seem to work for this one. There were parts that I liked, namely the narratives from the broken-English-thesaurus-abusing Alex, but even these got somewhat old. I found reading this book to be tedious and not enjoyable. I will still watch the movie when it comes out because the story itself is interesting, but I can't recommend this book. Clearly, Foer was still working out the kinks in his writing with this debut novel. I'll hold off for future efforts. Skip on this one.	2005-07-20

I picked it up because I am a high school English teacher and always looking for something new to teach. This book, in my opinion, is sort of the modern, female version of Catcher in the Rye, a book which I teach every year to students who seem to hate it! They can't seem to identify with Holden and complain that he complains too much! How ironic! This book, I think, would be much more enjoyable since it is written in more current language that teens can identify with. I did have some problems with this book, but as a person who works with emotionally troubled kids, I did see a lot of value in this, particularly for girls. I am not so sure that boys would be able to identify with it, but I could be wrong. I think parents could also benefit from this glimpse into the minds of young people. I think they will be surprised. Definitely worth picking up.	2005-07-19

I finished this book last night, and stayed awake until after 3 o'clock in the morning thinking about it. It's a complex story, but at the same time, a simple one. It is a tale of longing, of regret, of guilt, and of love.  It's the story of how we fail to communicate successfully with the ones we love. It's about the things we do and say, and the things we can't bring ourselves to. The one problem I had with it was the narrator who was supposed to be only nine years old. He was a very precocious child, and perhaps has Asperger's syndrome or Autism, though the author never mentions this. What the author did do was take a lot of creative risks with this book. You'll notice from a quick glance that it's not your typical adult novel, complete with pictures, color marks and such. While some might find these things distracting, I loved them! I looked forward to turning the page, not knowing what I'd find. I decided after just 80 pages or so that I want to read another book by this ingenious new author. Some might find the topic of 9-11 a little difficult to handle, particularly if you live in New York City, but while I did cringe at certain moments, I found myself audibly moved by so many others that I continued through with enthusiasm. I highly recommend this one!	2005-06-29

I was really looking forward to reading this one.  I love San Francisco, love historical fiction, am married to a firefighter, and am a California resident and have lived through many rather big earthquakes. I thought I'd just love this one. Well, I didn't. The story itself was not well written, kind of the caliber of what you'd expect from a made-for-TV movie. The dialogue was cheesy, like the latest summer action movie, where film makers are more concerned with dramatic effect than authenticity. This story COULD have been great. The author, in my opinion, took all the predictable (and lame) outs whenever he could. Characters in life-or-death situations were focused on the WRONG things (i.e. making a \\"romantic\\" gesture or confronting civic corruption) rather than the people in front of them who are trying to shoot them or the threatening fires reaching hundreds of feet over their heads. Just lame. All this being said, I did find myself wanting to finish it. I did want to see how things worked out, how the city came out the other end of this horrible event. Surprisingly, there is VERY little detail about the earthquake itself. In fact, it was almost glossed over, instead giving playing time to stereotypical characters (trite good guys vs. bad)and the fires that plagued the city for days. There are probably better books about this same subject; I would suggest looking elsewhere. This book just didn't do these events justice.	2005-06-21

This book pulled me in with a heart-felt story of two would-be sisters who experience difficult circumstances and moments where each is forced to select the best of two horrible choices. This novel reiterates the few choices many Indian women feel they have in their society. It brings up many difficult questions, some of which include: How much are you willing to sacrifice for those you love? How much do you owe others for the \\"sins\\" of your family members? Can we find happiness despite obstacles in our lives? I enjoyed the way it was set up, with alternating chapters told by each of the two women. While some in my book club saw the end coming, and saw some scenes as contrived, I didn't care. It was told in such a beautiful way that I forgave its little shortcomings. Well worth the read!	2005-06-09

The author has clearly done his homework, researching all the locations, interesting details and characters for this book. It was a great mix of fact and fiction and was written in a way that makes you feel like maybe, just maybe, it did happen. I particularly liked the way that the story is told in alternating chapters, from both Hemingway's and Mario Conde's perspectives. Each had a unique voice and attitude. This is a good, quick read. Pick it up and enjoy on the beach, with a nice rum drink, a la Hemingway!	2005-05-22

This book was selected this month as part of my book club. I had been wanting to read this for a while, so I was excited to pick it up. I pretty much only read fiction, so this was a change for me. I must say I had a hard time getting into it. I liked the story of both the passionate architect and the deranged serial killer, but I do think the architect story could have been edited way down. Much of the information was too detailed and cumbersome. (The index in the back of the book really is a good tool in getting through this one.) The last 100 pages or so though totally pulled me in, and I read them in practically one sitting. After discussing it in book club, I realized how much I really did like it; it's a good one to discuss with friends. For that, I would definitely recommend this one to others, especially if you live in Chicago or neightboring areas. I only wish there was a book like this written about my hometown (you know, without the murders!). Really educational, like a glimpse behind the scenes of history. Pick it up. Enjoy!	2005-05-12

I read this for my book club, and was surprised to find that so many women in my group could not get into this book! Some gave up after 5, 10 or even 50 pages. They were frustrated by what they saw as choppy translations and hard-to-remember French names. Those who did finish the book, like me, found it to be so rewarding! (Actually, I didn't have any difficulty getting into it from the get-go, but I do admit to making a cheat sheet to keep track of the characters' names and aliases.) The end is not cheesy, where many American writers and film makers would take this path. I did see it coming a bit, but it was still handled beautifully and with sincere emotion. I really liked how the author took a circular approach to this story, returning again and again to the same scene, each time with a new perspective or missing piece of the puzzle. Well worth the effort. I would definitely recommend reading this one.	2005-04-19

It's not that kind of book. I almost wish it was an assigned book for a class or for my book club so I'd have someone to talk about it with because I think it would prove to be much more rewarding that way. Unfortunately, I don't have that luxury, so I am forced to just take away from it what I can, which is that this book is rich in character, but somehow lacking in something that I can't quite put my finger on. It reads like an old classic, or something akin to Gosford Park in terms of modern adaptations of the comedy of manners theme. I would recommend it, though, but only guardedly, with friends who are interested in Victorian novels (because that's how it feels).	2005-04-19

I just closed this book moments ago, and am still not exactly sure how I feel about the ending. I loved the idea of this book, its complexities, its varied voices, the scope of its locations. I loved that the author used distinctly different voices to tell each narrative. I loved how these characters briefly overlapped into each others' stories. Very clever and well thought out, especially for a first time writer. The non-human's story, though, kind of lost me a bit, as did the last 50 pages or so. I felt like it was written in an esoteric language that I didn't quite understand. I wish that the author hadn't taken this turn when he did, because I was on the verge of giving this book 5 stars. By making this story too complex, perhaps, he lost me. At the risk of sounding unintelligent, it just went over my head.	2005-03-24

That being said, his sense of humor will pull you into his wacky stories. I had tried several months ago to read this book and just couldn't get past the first couple of stories. They just didn't grab me or live up to the \\"sidesplitting\\" review on the back of the book. Around Christmas time, I heard him on NPR reading some of his stories I believe from \\"Holidays on Ice,\\" and they were hilarious. This month, \\"Naked\\" was selected for my book club. I decided to borrow the book on tape from the library and, boy, was that the right decision! Sedaris, in my opinion, is meant to be heard not read. Unfortunately, not all the stories are included in the abridged CD. I listened to the stories that were, and read the ones that were not. By far, my favorites are the ones I could listen to. My recommendation would be for others to buy the audio and listen to it as they drive around time. It almost feels like picking up a quirky hitchhiker or a friend-of-a-friend-of-a-friend who keeps you entertained while you mill about town, and even though he makes you a little bit uncomfortable at times, you still are not looking forward to arriving at your destination and having the conversation end...	2005-03-05

I had some problem with the characters' obsessions with Latin and the odd pagan rituals surrounding the lake, but I was able to suspend disbelief long enough to enjoy the storyline. As the novel continued, though, the plot became more and more problematic, predictable, and just sort of creepy. The novel had great intentions but didn't quite deliver. I would try another book by this author, though, because I did like her writing style, but I can't really say that I recommend this book.	2005-02-26

I almost would have preferred to see this as a collection of Victorian-style ghost stories. They are written in a way that actually gives the reader chills (and I usually don't like those kinds of stories). I loved the idea of these stories integrating themselves into the lives of the characters of the novel. Great, great concept. As the book went on, though, I found myself so caught up in the stories (some of which were very long or stopped and restarted later on)that I couldn't follow the novel storyline as well as I would have liked. By the end, I was just really confused and disappointed. I hyped this book up to my friends early on, and now, after finishing it, I don't know if I would recommend it or not.

The characters in this novel were not as fully developed as they could have been, but I did care about them, and did find beauty in their story. This book is not something that will change your life, or even stay with you for any length of time after reading it. But, this being said, it is worth reading.	2004-07-25
US	24295389	R314HJAKZ6UJVV	0451202341	334925003	Back Roads	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Not for young readers...	I have worked with Emotionally Disturbed teenagers as an English teacher for 10 years. In that time, I have heard stories of abuse that are so disturbing, I thought nothing could shock me. This book shocked me. I didn't know what I was getting into when I picked it up. The front and back covers are very misleading. I feel, after reading this, that I know now exactly what Holden Caulfield was trying to protect kids from. Many times during reading this book I thought of putting it down and not finishing it. It was written in such a way, though, that I felt compelled to finish it. In fact, I read the last 100 pages in one sitting. I am warning the faint of heart, the weak of stomach, the prudes out there who don't want to hear about things that make people uncomfortable: Don't buy this book. For the rest of you, be open-minded, read it, and think about ways to make this world a better, safer place for those who need it most.	2004-07-14

I read this book over a year ago, and had honestly quite forgotten about it until I pulled all my books off the shelf to paint. I instantly remembered how much I loved reading this book. Classic literature? Not really. But the story pulls you in and doesn't let go. Admittingly, there was a scene I could have done without (kind of cheesy), but otherwise, I highly recommend this quick read. Enjoy!	2004-07-09

I read this as part of my book club, and it, like many of the other books we have read, is one that you set down after reading thinking, &quot;Hmm, not bad,&quot; but then after talking about it and analyzing it more closely, you start noticing all its subtleties. Then, it becomes so much more interesting and worthwhile. Read this one and then talk it out with a good friend.	2004-06-26

I am a big fan of historical mysteries, and had high hopes of one involving Poe. I found myself losing interest frequently throughout the novel. Other times, I just was confused. In the end, I just didn't really care what happened. Not horrible, but not worth the price, especially for a hardcover.	2004-06-26

Unfortunately Toole died so young. He could have gone on to write flawless work.    The main character is one you will think about at random times, at unexpected moments. He's a caricature , true, but unfortunately one so true to life that you'll find yourself chuckling to yourself while visiting your local bar or market. There goes another \\"Ignatius\\", doing something so foolish, so self-absorbed, so irresponsible. Pick this one up. You'll thank yourself later.	2004-06-26

The story is told in a way that shifts narrators and time period in a way that is not easy to follow. Moreover, the reader doesn't really care. Some parts of the story had me pulled in, but this didn't happen nearly enough.	2004-06-26

I'm by no means easily offended, disgusted or turned off by weirdness, but this did all those things. I couldn't finish it, and sold it (with a great deal of guilt) at a garage sale for 50 cents. That poor shmuck was ripped off! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!	2004-06-25

I was immediately drawn into both Scarlett's and Rhett's characters. The way in which their lives wove in and out of each other's was beautifully told. Mitchell presented them as real multi-dimensional people, with both good and bad qualities. When I saw the movie after completing the book, I was completely disappointed with it. While the movie stayed fairly true to the book (not changing anything important), it DID omit several things that I think were crucial to understanding Scarlett in particular. (I won't ruin it for your readers.) I HIGHLY recommend this book, even if you've seen the movie. It has quickly replaced The Count of Monte Cristo as my new favorite book of all time.	2004-05-10
