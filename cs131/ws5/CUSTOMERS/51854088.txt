I felt the IBBL did not light up the pages enough, especially if I was reading a hardcover.  I have used the Lightwedge now for about 2 months now and I am very happy with it.  I find it illuminates the entire page evenly, and it is definitely enough light to read in the dark.  Some have complained about the cirlces of light it produces, I have noticed this but after you get used to reading with this product, the circles are no longer noticeable or distracting.  Although, you do need to be careful with this because it does scratch rather easily, being plastic.  I noticed it had a lot after only using it for a very short time (the reason I gave 4 stars), yet when held against the page, you can not see them except for maybe one or two which are very faint and are not distracting or make it difficult to read at all .  It only becomes noticebale when you hold it in the air while it is on.  I do recommend keeping it in the box because that is the best way to keep it from getting damaged.  I am also looking forward to getting the paperback version- this version is a bit difficult to read with mass market paperbacks- and it comes out late November 2003.  The Lightwedge website says August 2003 but I think it was held off.  Some websites now have pre-orders for November 28 of this year.  If you are looking for a new book light, take a chance on this one!	2003-10-14

Starting off is a little difficult trying to understand who the narrator is because it is in the first person, but he is dead as well as a few of his friends.  Throughout the novel you hear both the main narrator and his friend's comments about what is going on in the lives of those they left a year ago when they died on Halloween night.  They are now ghosts who are summoned to stand by those who are thinking about them.<br />The tale was rather on the short side but never gets dull and really makes you feel for all of the characters.  Their flaws really stand out and you really feel for all of them regardless of their past mistakes.<br />I am not going to give it away but the ending was really something.  It really explained what happened a year prior and is also unexpected.<br />Get this book if you really want to read a great tale!	2003-10-13

I've read a lot of Grisham's novels and many of them I have liked, this was not one of them.  I felt there was not much of a plot except for someone finding a little over 3 million dollars and trying to figure out what to do with it.<br />Also, I read his latest novel, The King of Torts, right before I read The Summons, and I got very agitated when there were a lot of similarities between the two.  First of all there is a character who is introduced in The Summons and will play a larger part in The King Of Torts.  But when he wastes pages and pages discussing mass torts that was discussed in entirety in his latest book, it got very boring since it was nothing new he was providing.  This 340 page novel could have been cut down to a 50 page short story.  It seems Grisham is losing the greatness found in his earlier works.  One piece of advice, between King of Torts and The Summons, choose one and skip the other, if you are determined to read either of them.  I recommend don't even bother reading either of them.	2003-06-20
US	51854088	R1R82CMO0G9C6B	0553802488	607743484	The Face	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Very Entertaining	I was surprised to find Koontz publishing another novel shortly after By Light of the Moon, but it was not a disappointment.  Although I found the beginning to be a bit slow and he tended to be very wordy with the adjectives I found the plot to be great.  There was suspense and mystery and the paranormal all in one, and it was well done.  Koontz really gets into the characters heads that really helps to make the story feel a bit more real.  You can get an idea of what it is about from other reviews the from above but I would definitely read this if you like Koontz, and if you haven't read him try with this book.  I also highly recommend BY Light of the Moon, Watchers, and Tick Tock if you are looking for a shorter more humorous read.	2003-06-20

Needed more though	I've read a bunch of Grisham's novel, not all of them, and this was ok. I found the story line to be rather interesting and learned a lot how the tort system works. Yet, my main problem with this book is that Grisham seemed to start a dilemma with the main character and then it was quickly resolved and onto a new problem. I felt a lot of this book was rushed and it could have gotten into more detail. I also noticed that many of his newer works seem to to be almost exactly the same length in pages. I am wondering if he has to meet a page limit and a lot gets cut out of the finished product.<br />Overall I think this was a decent work but still doesn't live up to his very early works.  Also, after reading the Summons, a lot of the info regarding torts was discussed in The Summons and it seemed like a copy and paste job was done.	2003-05-28
US	51854088	R39N1ZXTXM8JNI	0066214122	245555180	Prey	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Good idea, Lacking substance	This was the first novel I read by Crichton and overall it was pretty good.  The concept of nanotechnology is very interesting.  I have also read By Light of the Moon by Dean Koontz which dealt with nanotechnology but in a different way.  The major complaint I had was with the whole focus on the narrator's family life.  Although it played a role in the plot, I felt it went too deep into it and took away from the story.  Also, the I didn't like the way the author portrayed the kids.  The kid's behavior didn't seem real life, the name calling was something an adult might imagine children saying to each but in reality don't.  And after awhile it just got annoying reading about them.  I gave it three stars because of the idea and also the second half of the novel was better than the first half.	2003-05-23

For a 700 page book I was expecting it to slow down at a point but it never did.  This truly was a great mystery.  I was also wondering if I would find it interesting since it takes place in 1699, but after reading this, the time setting made the story even better.  The history and descriptions of the background was really amazing.  This is the first book I read by him and I look foward to reading many more of his works. Robert McCammon really has a talent for writing.  It was dissapointing having to finish the book and few book do that for me.	2003-05-11

The action keeps you from beginning to end and does not get tiresome.  You can basically get an idea what the book is about from above and from other reviews, so I am just going to recommend to read this book if you haven't.  If you haven't read Koontz, start with this one.  I also highly recommend BY Light of the Moon, and also Tick Tock if you are looking for a more humorous, lighter read.	2003-04-20
US	51854088	R2YA8IR51DHU4J	0425181111	742127435	Strangers	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Very Good	This is the fifth or sixth book I have read by this author and I am glad I did.  The book starts out great with mysterious occurances making you guess what is really going on with a group of people. Koontz spends a lot of the time developing the characters individually and enabling the reader to really get to know them.  The suspense keeps you all the way through.  Although the ending was great, I did find it a little unbelievable. It is not because of the way it ended, but because of the things certain characters said and behaved (possible spoiler ahead).  They all held the same thoughts regarding the &quot;secret&quot;. If this occured to me, I do not think I would have felt the way these characters did, or said certain things.  I felt there should have been some conflict or disagreement among some of the characters in the end. Yet, overall it was a great and entertaining read.  I also recommend his latest novel BY Light of the Moon (although the ending there I thought was bit off too).	2003-02-23

The characters were greatly developed and the humor in the book made it even better.  The action keeps the reader involved and the story does not get tiresome.  The only complaint I have is the ending, which I felt took a 180 degree turn out of no where.  Don't know if Koonts plans on writing a sequal to the book as another reviewer suggested but I hope not because I do not believe it could live up to this one.  Regardless, definetely read this novel, it will be worth your time.  I also suggest Tick Tock by Koontz if youre looking for a shorter humorous read.	2003-01-19
US	51854088	R3TSHF253SSLQH	0451167317	877287899	The Dark Half	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Great!!	This was a great novel by King.  Many people may say it was great but one of their least favorite by King, I disagree. It is rather a shorter story than many of his more in-depth novels but it keeps your attention throughout the entire plot.  You can basically get the idea of the story from this site so I am not going to get in detail about that.  Yet, it does focus a lot on King's own life regarding his other pen name, Richard Bachman.  Overall I though this was a great read and definitly had the suspense.	2003-01-02
US	51854088	R1LOQVO2ZZ2Y4E	0553582941	191153164	Sole Survivor	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Great	This was a great book to read.  I've only read a few of Koontz's books and I have found them all to be very good, this one included.<br />The story basically involves a man who loses his wife and two children aboard a plane crash.  A year later he believes his family may be alive because he has discovered there is someone who actually had survived but is hiding from everyone.<br />Most of the novel deals with Joe, the main character trying to find this women who is hiding and hoping his family is alive.  At the very end you find out all the questions which are asked throughout the novel.<br />Overall this was a great read.  In my opinion, I would have liked to have seen the ending dealt with in more depth possibly in the middle of the novel.  I also felt the last few pages seemed kind of rushed.  But over all this was a wonderful book.	2002-12-31
US	51854088	R3FCJV22ASR1ZD	0553582925	199284738	Tick Tock	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Really great and fun read.	This is about the third book I read by Koontz, the other having been read about 8 years ago, but I thought this one was great.  It's a shorter novel and fast paced.  It basically tells about one night where a man and a women- who seems a bit loose some screws- are on the run from a demon who has been summoned to kill the male character.  The author takes a lighter tone with this novel and makes you laugh at times over the dialogue between the lead character and those he knows.  The only thing I felt could have been better was the ending.  It wasn't as climatic as I would have like, but still definitly good.  Definitly read this book if you like horror suspense with some laughter along.	2002-11-23

It took me over a month to read this because it just didn't grab my attention as many as his other books have.<br />Basically, its about a Buick (if you haven't guessed) that has some portel to somewhere else and tends to both vomit and consume things from both worlds.  The upchucking scenes were interesting but there weren't alot of those, and the rest was just a narrative of the past experiences of a group of police officers in Penn.  Yet, the ending was good and defintely had my attention there.  Overall, it was good and that is why I give it three stars.	2002-11-11

Although this was the first book I read by Little, I am sorry I did.<br />The book starts out with a man who leaves his life to find a new one. He does by stumbling across a group of college students digging up the remains on some Anasazi Indian culture. First off all, the author used a lot of Native American Indian terms, and if you don't have a clue into the history of Native Americans, you will be at a lost. The author really needed to explain what some things were in the novel, such as certain artifacts, but instead he decides to draw out a scene where a couple searches for a lost mummy. ... It was like enough already!<br />Also, I know this is a horror book, and horror books are usually far fetched, but this novel I found ridiculous. The way characters reacted to certain scenes was not typical. [It] made me feel like I was reading a 10 year old cartoon. ...The author wanted to make it seem like the rest of the U.S. could care less about the west, which was also far fetched. ... Thank you.	2002-09-28

What I really like about this book is that these stories supposedly &quot;true&quot; which, for me has a tendency to have a little more harder time going to sleep.  Its a collection of accounts of paranormal activity across America, usually just one or two per state.  If you like this book I recommend their other called Haunted Heartland, although this focuses mainly on the mid-west.	2002-07-30

I must say there were a lot characters which kept it a tiny bit hard to keep track.  Yet, I've read about 12 other novels of King's and this is up there on the list.  I thought some parts would be drawn out considering the length of the book but this did not happen.  I must admit that I did not find this novel scary and up at night because of it, but it did have some suspenseful scenes.  If you like King definetly read this and if you haven't read any of his works then start with this.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because there a few other of King's works that I enjoyed more, but this was definetly good.	2002-07-28

I especially liked Riding the Bullet, a classic haunted story.  Many others were fantastic, such as 1408.  Others were chilling.  A few were a bit slow, such as the gangster story (I forget the title).  There is a Dark Tower short story, since I've only read the first one, it was a little difficult to follow.

It took our reality and made a chilling twist to it where there is a contest every year and a hundred or so young guys walk continuously until they can't any longer.  When they can't they're killed.  At times the book seemed to be a bit slow and at times it seemed to jump ahead too quickly.  I found the ending to be a little to quick and unlcear, but just the idea behind the book, and how the characters excepted this as normal and fun is all-out creepy.	2002-05-20

I dealt with aliens, which I am assuming is a bit different from most of the author's previous novels.  But the plot and subplots were really indepth and fascinating.

Although its over 600 pages, its not too drawn out.  I felt it slowed down during the chase part of the novel, but i felt overall it kept you threw it.  Since it was the first I have read I do not have any comparisons to his other works.  One reviewer criticized the obsentities, theyre are a lot but I truly feel without these, (they were portrayed through the characters) the characters would have looked less real, and some of them were funny.  I was expecting more of ghosts, scary, type horror, but this novel dealt with aliens.  King made it seem true, most of the time, not fake and too unbelievable.  Overall a very good book.	2001-06-28
