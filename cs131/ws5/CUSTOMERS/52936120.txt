Okay, I do have a pet peeve that this book does not contain all of the recipes that are done on the show. If a book is meant to be a tie-in with a television program, it makes sense to include as much as possible. <br /> <br />The book does have lush color photos and is beautifully designed, as is the television program, but I find that the content of the book is on the simplistic side. That is not to say that there aren't some really nice recipes, such as the Lemon Pasta, a favorite of mine, but I feel that overall the recipes in this book tend to be ones that I have seen in many other books.  <br /> <br />If you are looking for a book that offers BEGINNER'S basics on light Italian cooking, then this is for you. If you already have a couple of Italian cookbooks in your possession, then skip this one, you probably already have 90% of the recipes in this edition.	2005-08-26

I am well acquainted with the videos and DVD's of Bryan Kest and he is one of my favorite yoga teachers. His style is very warm and relaxing, not uptight. He concentrates in this CD on the breathing first and foremost, then the poses, stressing that you should follow what your own body needs and can do. That said, this is a really good, intense workout that makes muscles sore that you didn't even know that you had. I am not usually one to do ninety minutes of working out on a regular basis, but the time goes fast in this workout. None of the poses are especially difficult to do, although there are a few that I did in the modified format. Advanced power yoga refers, as Bryan says, to your body awareness. I am aware of mine - it is still sore! (but in a good way!) The workout leaves you relaxed yet invigorated and I feel that I can concentrate easier on the poses in this audio only format where I am not distracted with someone else's form. Another interesting aside is that this CD recording is of an actual class - you can hear Bryan interacting with the students, helping with poses, you can even hear the bus go by outside once or twice! It feels as if you are there ---and I find that his narrative is comforting, but also humorous sometimes and helps break up any tension you might be feeling going into the pose. A welcome Workout to anyone's collection.<br />Namaste.	2003-04-29

I am an aficianada of Bryan Kest's original Power Yoga series from 1995. I also enjoy his new videos (especially Intensive Sculpting) from 2002. But...I just love this CD. It is the best workout that I have done in a long time - maybe ever. I thought initially that it might be weird working out without the visual imagery of video, but it is actually better. Bryan's voice is extra soothing, and his direction easily guides you from pose to pose without needing to look at the included book, (assuming that you know a few basic poses, such as cobra and down dog - the others he aptly describes.) I found myself more able to concentrate on the yoga, without distraction. The basic workout begins a bit more relaxed than his Power Yoga series, taking a bit more time to stretch, as opposed to getting your muscles &quot;hot&quot; right away. But before long, you find that your heart rate is getting up there and your muscles are working and that you are doing some invigorating but really challenging balances. This is spinal strenghening at its best, relaxation at its deepest. Bryan Kest's emphasis is, as always, on knowing your body and its limitations and first and foremost, feeling the breath. Another nice thing about this workout is that although it is divided between two CD's, the second CD is basically the last stretches and relaxation, so if you have a single CD player machine, you are not changing the discs in the middle of an intense pose. Also, you might like to do the relaxation CD by itself sometime, just to unwind. A bonus is the book, which has all of the poses and could be taken on a vacation even when you don't want to take the CD. This CD is great - and a day after doing this workout, all of my muscles feel like they got their fair workout. Six stars. Check it out.	2003-04-24

I bought this one on ... months ago, and it has since become a faithful friend in the kitchen. While I cannot say that I use it as much as HOw To Eat, which is a virtual cooking bible, it has some fantastic recipes that have become instant classics, such as the seared mustard coated salmon, which is light, flavorful and so easy it makes you almost feel guilty to accept all of the compliments - or the figs for a thousand and one nights that is almost effortless, but so full of flavor, with rosewater, cinnamon, butter, orange and mascarpone. YOu just have to trust me on how good this tastes. This book is full of creative and flavorful salads and soup that borrow from a few different cultures (the beet and dill salad is very Russian). There are some very nice Asian style fish dishes, as well as plenty of meat recipes, on the grill and off. The book finishes with plenty of summery old fashioned ice cream recipes, shortbreads, etc. and the last chapter is full of fun cocktails, mostly fruit based, both classic and new. The fare in this book tends to be a little bit lighter (summer!) and there seem to be even more easy to prepare recipes (that do not sacrifice flavor!) This book will be a happy addition to your cookbook collection. :)	2003-04-03

I am a big fan of Nigella's books, and although I am not really a &quot;baker&quot; - more of a home gourmet cook- I have really got an affectionate place in my heart for baking. This book is great, because when I have the urge to bake, or I need to bake something quick to take over to someone's house, or I want an intricate recipe to spend the afternoon making - this book satisfies my every mood. The easy almond cake is just that, and was so worth buying a springform pan for - looks as impressive as heck and is so quick ;) . Tonight I came home and forty five minutes later I had wonderful rose scented madeleines that were already cooked! What I like about Nigella Lawson is that she understands that so many people have busy lifestyles and that if every recipe that we see for baking is intricate and complicated and time consuming that we just won't do it - we will get too discouraged. There are simple, classic and delicious baked goods that one can make well and make often,  and there are some spectacular recipes when you want to pull out all the stops. Oh, and since I didn't really mention it, there are plenty of savory baked goods in this book, as well as some lovely baked things for children. I just haven't made these ones - yet...<BR>Buy it, don't be scared, baking is fun, and yes, it can be truly therapeutic (especially yeasty breads and things you can pound)	2003-03-16

This is not only a wonderful resource for Mexican cooking, it is also an extensive geographic and historic research of the various regions of Mexico. In my naivete, searching for \\"authentic\\" Mexican cookbooks a few years ago, I skipped over Diana Kennedy's books as being written by a western and therefore \\"unauthentic\\" Mexican cooking source. Oh, foolish me. Little did I know that this Welsh born woman has traveled and lived in Mexico for over three decades! She came here with her husband in the fifties and loved it here so much that after he died, she decided to stay. She is the source of Mexican cooking - this is her life and her love, and the book reflects this. For those who don't cook, but love to eat, love to travel and love Mexico, this book is for you. For those who love to cook and love to read about food - que buena suerte! (btw - this book is in Spanish) And - this makes a greaaaat gift for relatives in Mexico who love to cook (oddly enough, it is not easy to find a nice Mexican cookbook in Mexico, and if you do, it is quite expensive.)	2003-03-11

I was originally dissuaded from buying this book from a reviewer on the UK site who said that this book was a combination of \\"Domestic Goddess\\" and \\"HOw to Eat\\"; it is not. Nigella's style is very chatty and it is like having a friend in the kitchen with you. She also encourages substituting ingredients (offering her own options) when you are unable to find something, such as Seville Oranges. She also encourages that the reader/cook use these recipes as a guideline, changing them to suit their own taste/ingredients on hand, and she includes a section at the end of each chapter where you can jot down your own notes. I have already tried two of the recipes, the Lemon Risotto and the Chicken Breast with Cannellini Beans and Kale (I substituted Beetroot Greens - I am sure Nigella would approve.) These met with great success from my culinarily spoiled husband, who said they tasted great, and from me, since both recipes were fantastically easy, yet looked like I tried so much harder than I did. Nigella's recipes range from slow-cooked meals for lazy weekends to very fast dinners, what ever suits the cook and the eater(s). Finally, thumbs up to the organizational sections of the book, and I positively cannot give less than five stars to anyone who readily admits to being an Amazon addict (like myself!) Check this book out - you will not be disappointed! :)	2002-12-11

For those who like Jamie Oliver's first two books, this is more of the same nice stuff - good rustic recipes that are tasty and some of which are very fast and easy to make. The recipes are a mixture of Italian, British fare from Jamie's childhood days, and a mixture of a few other cuisines. What is nice about this book is that there is also a section about cooking with kids and getting kids interested in helping with food preparation and to make meals more interesting and interactive for them (and you!). Also, at the end there is a section of drinks as well, some alcoholic (like the sidecar) and some non-alcoholic (like mango lassi). All in all this is a really nice book and it will make you realize that making your own bread, soups, tarts, etc is not really hard, and is really rewarding and fun. And... as a wife who cooks every day, it has given me a lot of fresh ideas for new meals. check it out!	2002-10-01

Really easy to make and tasty	This book, which is also on the British site published as &quot;Return of the Naked Chef&quot; is a real find. I have had this book for ages, as I have a British copy and I have found myself using it over and over again, especially for the pizza recipe, which Jamie makes so easy that it's unbelieveable (and the results are so much better than what you get in a pizzeria!-well, at least one on this side of the Atlantic). HIs style is mostly Italian, with a bit of British and a little bit of French and a little exotic Indian touch now and again. The recipes are healthy, creative and make me want to cook when I come home from a long day at work. I find that his ideas in the book will sometimes inspire a different recipe from me, but I get the impression, that in writing his cookbooks, that is kind of what he wants as well. I also like the lists he gives of what you should have in your pantry to be able to make a dinner. Oh, by the way, Happy Days with the Naked Chef is also good, and if you can't wait until November, it is available on AmazonUK.	2002-07-11

I can't say enough good things about this book. The subject matter, murder, initially put me off, until I read an excerpt of the book on Amazon (the whole 30 pages, as a matter of fact) and was completely taken in. THe writing is so crisp. One feels as if he/she is hearing Susie's thoughts, and the author seems to have a perfect recollection of a fourteen year old's mind and what would be important in her world. The book is about death, of course, but it is compelling in that the book's secret is that it is really about LIFE, who we are, the choices that we make, how we live our lives, how the lives of others affect us, and how we are perceived by others. Susie takes us on a wonderful journey through her own heaven and realizations about life, love and family, and we see the journeys of those closest to her. This book is so fantastic!

It really puts your life into perspective. The book is well written and is really informative about the Stalin era in the Soviet Union, but it reads as a personal account and not as a page out of a history book. Even people in prison can be petty and selfish and these people do not always look out for each other - but sometimes they do, in remarkable ways. This book really tells about human nature and the strength of the human spirit to endure, without being preachy at all. This should be on everyone's must-read list.	2002-07-04

Kundera is one of the great writers of our time - for those who don't know, he is a Czech who lives in France and writes all of his stories in French. This book deals with the 1968 Czech occupation by the Soviets, a familiar topic to Kundera, however, the book is so much more. It is more of a statement about life and the choices that we make. At one point in the novel, the protagonist, Tomas, revels in the idea of having two lives, the first to do what we want, and the second to go back and get it all right. Does Tomas make the right decision between his two loves? Does he make the right decision between his job and his integrity? Is there such a thing as a right choice, really? I won't spoil it for you - you have to read it to find out. FYI - for those of you who are not big historical buffs, the emphasis on history is minimal - don't let that scare you off. For those of you who are afraid that the book might be too philosophical  - it really isn't - it is just beautifully written and will make you think...	2002-07-04

While to be sure, this is not an in-depth thesis of forensics, for what it is, which is a layman's overview of forensic methods and detection, it is quite good.

Perhaps it says a bit more about this reviewer than it should, but that photo is one of my favorites - I just could not stop laughing! The photo essay ranges over about three decades and the pictures are not your typical pictures of the Eiffel Tower or of the Arc de Triomphe but rather people and places and neighborhoods of Paris. One gets the feeling of sneaking a peek into these people's lives. Cartier-Bresson is a master behind the lens and this is his city, so you can't expect less than the best - and he doesn't disappoint. (check out the two dogs...)	2002-06-30

I was not expecting the book to be what it was in this context - there are a lot of family stories and stories about her life in Chile. The book is fascinating, but is also quite sad as well. Indeed there are many passages about Allende's daughter Paula being in a coma and later in a vegetative state, and these passages, although well written are often times very emotionally difficult to read. My heart goes out to the author - it must have been an incredibly difficult book to write. I found the book easier to read a bit at a time, and as I was reading it in the original Spanish, this was not difficult. It is well worth reading. I waited too long to read this book because I thought that it was going to be nonstop depressing news of Paula in the hospital and for the most part, it really isn't, but it is sad and it probably will make you cry at the end, but go for it anyway - it's good to have feelings to know that you are alive, right?	2002-06-30

I received this book as a gift from a pen pal in Japan about fifteen years ago, and recently found it on Amazon - so I had to buy copies of it for all of my friends. This is a very sweet, simple book and it is also a true story of the author, who is a famous television personality in Japan. The story is written very simply, and it would not be inappropriate for a child, yet not too simplified for an adult. The story begins when Totto-chan, the heroine of the story, is on her way to a new school after being expelled from her old school (she does not find out about the expulsion until years later). The new school is a progressive school which does things in a different way, and treats children differently, teaching them to see the world in a new way. The book is filled with side splitting funny stories, and a few touching ones as well. When you finish reading it, (it won't take long) it will bring a tear to your eye, but make you smile, and make you feel better for having read it. Check it out - I promise you won't be disappointed.	2002-06-27

Cartier-Bresson knows his craft well, and yet I feel a slight disappointment in the book, as I had hoped that his range of subject matter would be a little more varied, and perhaps show a few more pictures of the countryside. This collection of photos is nice, but consists mostly of shots of a sociological nature, from the poor classes of Mexican society. I understand that this is Cartier-Bresson's personal photo essay, but perhaps he could have widened his scope of Mexico to have included a wider array of subject matter. I do like the pictures, there just should have been more of a variance of them. If you like Cartier-Bresson, his book of India is simply fantastic.	2002-06-27

Whereas the subjects of the other two books are of more of an artistic or sociological nature, the subjects of this book are primarily political in nature. Cartier-Bresson was in India in 1947 (as well as numerous other occasions) to photograph the turbulent times of the country. Some pictures are of Gandhi the day before his death, others are of his body on the funeral pyre. These images are spectacular. There are plenty of images of day to day life in India ( the most current being circa 1966) and these are quite nice - I especially like the photograph of the saris (which are about 5 yards long) drying in the sun. This is such a beautiful book- and it is much cheaper than a trip to India!	2002-06-27

She speaks a lot of France, and about her life experiences mingled with all sorts of facts and trivia and research about food. It is lovingly written.

It is like a cooking bible. I have over 100 cookbooks, so I do not say this in jest. I love the way that the book is organized and sectioned off, from dishes for solo or duo diners, to dishes that are lowfat and food that can be cooked with children. It is really cleverly designed. The recipes range from elaborate dishes, to the roast asparagus that I prepared the day that I got the book.

I have searched at great length to find books of Mexican cooking which are authentic, and not adapted to suit American palates. The cuisine of Veracruz is really varied and due to influences from Mexico, Africa, and the Caribbean. Most of the recipes in this book are not what one would think of as stereotypically Mexican.

It is by no means a comprehensive in depth guide to every religion, but it is quite useful in giving one a thumbnail sketch of the religion in question, and it covers a lot of territory.

Mistry's prose, and  the way the book is laid out is flawless - he captures the characters  perfectly by letting the reader get to know them individually, then  collectively.

Although the book shows some very therapeutic poses, it also shows how to &quot;purify &quot; your nose by using dental floss and how to purge your stomach  - not the book I thought it would be.  For those fellow fans of power yoga I suggest Birch's Power Yoga - an excellent book.	1997-11-16
