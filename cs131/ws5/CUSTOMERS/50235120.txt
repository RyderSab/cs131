With currently 707 reviews of this book I don't know how you are going to notice mine <br /> <br />~ B U T . I . W I L L . G I V E . I T . A . G O . A N Y W A Y ~ <br /> <br />This book isn't bad. Have a quick look through the other reviews, you'll see about 1/3rd of the people loved it, 1/3rd hated it, and 1/3rd were 50-50 .... so it is worth your while trying to discover if you are in the 1/3rd who loved it. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed it. It isn't perfect. It isn't great literature. It isn't bestselling blockbuster fiction. It probably will be made into a movie, with an A-rate budget but B-rate profits. Or maybe the script will never get through ... the novel reads a bit like it was designed with a movie in mind, a thriller.  <br /> <br />The science is far from realistic, but THIS IS A NOVEL, people, this is not a textbook. Surrounded by doctors, geneticists, engineers and with skill in AI and interest in nanotechnology that puts me well above average understanding of these topics I did not have much trouble suspending my belief whilst reading this book - my secret is, when I look down and see a book in front of me, I realise IT IS A WORK OF FICTION and I don't nit-pick it to pieces. If the other reviewers can't suspend their beliefs for awhile, then it is true that the author has failed them - it is the authors' job to help people suspend their belief.  <br /> <br />I would imagine many fans of Crichton are very technical, and love his previous work for helping them suspend their belief, something they probably have trouble doing if they are scientific minded people. Although perhaps he did that in the past by presenting accepted science, not through the skill of an author.  I would say that people with some knowledge in these fields who have trouble suspending their beliefs (to allow for the inadequacy of Crichton in this novel) will probably be disappointed. They certainly sound angry in their reviews. <br /> <br />However if you can suspend your belief andmake up for his stuff ups, then you can really enjoy this novel.  <br /> <br />There isn't much else I can cover that has not been covered by the many other reviews here (which are as good a read as the novel itself) - just keep in mind that you might really enjoy the novel, perhaps give it a go.  <br /> <br />	2005-08-15

The Shakers themselves are quite interesting, and their attitudes of constantly improving and making work easier, more joyful and freeing time for better pursuits than toil are a mantra we all should live by, perhaps. Although the Shakers were very minimalist, I believe many other great craftsmen of the past shared their attitudes and enjoyment of the process of making furniture. <br /> <br />The second part of the book details many fine examples of Shaker furniture. These are great items, well made, well designed, and even if the style is not your preferred one, they still may inspire you.  <br /> <br />Note that it is NOT a \\"how-to\\" book as another reviewer pointed out, although if you have some skill you could easily reproduce the items in it ? more importantly, be inspired by them. <br /> <br />I have an extraordinary library of woodworking and furniture books covering all styles and all ages and I would definetely recommend this one as being in the top 10% - but I have to stress, it is not a how-to book, look elsewhere if you are looking for that. <br /> <br />Finally, thanks to all the other reviewers here who convinced me to purchase it, I had seen it in the shops before but passed it over (not preferring Shaker style). I will now go tick all your reviews as being helpful. <br /> <br />Did I mention it is absolutely full of colour photos, sidebars of interesting information and very readable and interesting? <br />	2005-08-10

(I was tempted to give it 2 to get your attention even more) <br /> <br />It is a good book. It is worth reading, although painful at times ... by painful, I mean BORING, incredibly boring, for the last 2/3rds of the book I was wishing it would end. Why didn't I just throw it aside? Because it is worth reading, every so often there are gems of information, it does cover everything quite well, and Coucy's story alone was very interesting.  <br /> <br />I agree with the other reviews written here, there are currently 72 reviews, I have not read them all but most I agree with. There were some negative reviews which almost turned me away from the book, I am glad I ignored them and read it, but I do agree with them that it was very boring at times.  <br /> <br />I can't add much more except to say that it is a large book, very thick, with smallish type, which doesn't make it any easier to chew through it, there are some good photos in it to help break it up a bit.  <br /> <br />If you really want an overview of the period, it is worthwhile. I am just trying to warn you that it isn't exactly a pleasure. <br /> <br />Oh, and my thoughts on all the knights of the time, that I am sure are admired by many readers with concepts of chivalry - those knights were a bunch of idiots, and the concept of chivalry, moronic, hypocritical and pathetic, as seen in every example of everything they did. So it is probably worthwhile reading for anyone bewitched by the popular fiction concept of chivalry.	2005-07-28

I don't really know where to begin or what I can add to the many other fine reviews here, they that convinced me to buy this book. <br /> <br />I don't even like Windsor chairs, I think they are kind of ugly, I've seen too many cheap country furniture knock-offs, they make me kind of sick. Some - very few - are stunning. There are a few good ones in this book, and in other books I have on furniture history.  <br /> <br />Why I bought this book was for the techniques involved, and reading the other reviews I was convinced it would be worth my money.  <br /> <br />AND IT WAS - AND THEN SOME. <br /> <br />I have many, many books on woodworking and it is rare that I am surprised by something new, old or different that I did not know, but this book is so incredibly thorough and covers so many things - well - it blew me away. I am very impressed.  <br /> <br />If it introduces a tool, it tells you how to use it, make it, even with plans. It details everything every step of the way. I can't be bothered counting all the things it tells you but I would have paid the money just for info. on building a shave horse and designs for one chair and a bowsaw. <br /> <br />Also, it is a BIG book. Tall, wide, and THICK, 300 pages makes it quite a thick book. PACKED with information, not waffle. <br /> <br />I hope my rambling review helps convince you it is worth it, the other reviews here have more detail, I really just wanted to add my vote. I think everyone gave it 5 stars. I'd say it probably should be on every woodworkers' bookshelf. <br /> <br />	2005-06-29

Look at all the 5 star reviews - I agree, I don't know if there is anything I can add, except that along the bottom of the pages, is a timeline that spans history with notes on the important events of the years, which match the current topics on the pages.

He does not stick to strict Queen Anne but covers the subtle variations such as the Gaines chair (one of my favourites) ... this book is a true gem and since receiving it I can hardly put it down. A great resource and would make a fantastic present for someone interested in woodwork. Queen Anne furniture would have to be near the pinnacle of woodworking but with this book it seems reachable. <br /> <br />Truly excellent.  <br /> <br />Wish that author would write some more on other periods (ie ALL other periods from early medieval to modern). I would not hesitate to collect them all.	2005-05-30

I have not read or worked through the entire book yet (it is truly enormous, and I already have most of the skills so it is re-capping them for me) but it is worth 5 stars for the pictures alone - many, many examples of carved furniture through history. Books with that many photos of historical pieces are hard to come by and usually very, very expensive. So for that alone it is worth the price. <br /> <br />I cannot yet comment on the written content nor how suitable it would be for a beginner, but it is certainly worth a look.	2005-05-30

There are 4 pages at the front talking of the history in general but nothing specific for each of the pictures.  <br /> <br />The purpose of this book seems to be for people to transfer the images onto something else (by tracing etc..) but really, there is little substance to it, and you could find better pictures with a simple google search.  <br /> <br />This book would have been far better with detailed explanations of the diagrams, their origins, photos of originals and greyscale, or dare I ask, colour. A great opportunity missed by the author. As it stands, it is worth approximately $2.00 only, with free postage. <br /> <br />A vastly superior work is \\"the Dragon and the Griffin\\" which is a 160 page book that details the elements of the designs and the progress through time.  <br /> <br />I hate to have posted such a negative review but wish to save people the waste of time and money I endured due to the other favorable reviews, which I suspect were friends of the author. <br /> <br />	2005-05-30

If you are looking for one, get this one, and good luck. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-30

It paints an excellent picture of all the main characters and gives an understanding of what drove them to do what they did, it shows the people behind the history, instead of just laying out the \\"facts\\" (which too often in other books are from poor sources) and showing everything as black and white. The reader should realise how human, and fallible, the people were, rather than telling history as if it was a modern movie, with simplistic characters following dumbed down scripts.  <br /> <br />It is also very readable, enjoyable, gripping.  <br /> <br />I cannot recommend it enough.	2005-05-09

I cannot recommend this book enough for anyone who wants to learn woodcarving (and I have many books on the subject), it is a shame it is out of print but chase it up on zshops or marketplace, it is worth it. Well written, enjoyable and useful. <br /> <br />I would say, if you are going to get a single book on woodcarving, get this one - it shows you everything from tool selection (even pointing out the differences in mallet handle shapes and their advantages) to tool sharpening, then goes through many different projects building your skills with each one. The techniques are explained in detail, with all the subtle differences required. Examples are shown of works gone wrong - even though only slightly wrong - and an explanation given for what went wrong. It is more important to show what goes wrong than just show perfect examples, otherwise you would not even know what was wrong with your piece or how it could be improved. The examples cover everything and build a great skillset.  <br /> <br />Also, the many, many, many photos are COLOUR, and excellent quality.  <br /> <br />Considering what you would pay to do a course such as this, it's a steal. <br />	2005-04-27

It is quite large, very thorough, is loaded with colour photos (every second page?) and as well, colour diagrams. It covers everything (that I can think of) with almost step-by-step instructions and many examples from both real life (pictures of buildings, doorways, windows) and the workshop (finished items on the table). I find the colour photos very useful, as they give a good indication of the kind of beauty you can aim for, and the photos of work in progress also very useful. I don't think black and white photos are as good for this kind of book, so I was very happy to see so much vivid colour. <br /> <br />I would say you would need to be a bit beyond beginner to get the most out of this, perhaps early novice would be enough.  <br /> <br />Overall a very useful book, well worth the money and the best I have seen for carving these kinds of things, and I have the Taunton books (which often seem lacking, somehow). <br /> <br />	2005-03-30

Spain is a beautiful place and this book is a bit one-sided, although to be honest I didn't even notice that until I read the other review.  <br /> <br />If you are interested in the things it does concentrate on, it is a very nice book.

I think this is a very good book and I cannot understand the negative reviews that have been posted here.     I also have &quot;Reminiscences of a Stock Operator&quot; which I read first, and I don't find repetition here. Although I found Remin. to be a good book as well, I think I prefer this one - being closer to the truth, and full of investment advice worth its weight in gold, where Remin. tended to hide the advice amongst the fictionalised story.     I did not find it poorly written. I found it very entertaining, interesting and educational.     I won't go on and on about the good things in this book - if you are involved in the markets and can't afford to take a gamble at buying it and taking a look, and throwing it in the bin if you decide for youself it is no good - if you are struggling to justify the $$$ to be able to do that, then just give up now.     I just wanted to post this review to counter the few negative reviews here, so that the few who might be turned away by them instead might reconsider. It is good, it has valuable info. in it, and it is entertaining and educational. Give it a go.	2004-07-21

He is a very aggressive marketer - and successful at making a name for himself - and I would not be at all surprised if he deliberately spammed amazon + other sites with positive recommendations for his books. <br />There is no justification for many of the positive reviews seen here. Quite a few of them refer to things that the book simply does not contain. <br />I have nothing against Pavel and I think some of his other works are very good, for example, the Kettlebell book. It is not the best it can be, far from it, it is very incomplete, but overall the Kettlebell book is a good read, has good exercises, Pavel has  quite a bit of eccentric charm. <br />HOWEVER I think this book is a bit light, nothing special, and I think most if not all the positive reviews here are covert advertising - so anyone reading these, take note of what I am saying, take them with a grain of salt AND LOOK AT THE BOOK FOR YOURSELF before you buy it, make up your own mind. <br />I am not denying that the book has some worth nor that the exercises won't help you out, however the price is high, the content sparse and the advertising thick and in your face.<br />MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND. <br />Oh, and Pavel (+friends), please don't come back posting a review along the lines of &quot;well I was put off by the negative review then I had a look in the bookstore and it was fantastic&quot; you've already done a few of those. I say to genuine readers - go and LOOK at the book first (then order from amazon if you like it). DON'T trust these reviews.	2003-12-01

For example, if you are already very advanced, and have developed your own systems either in your head or on computer. <br />If you are a beginner / novice you might be completely overwhelmed. <br />Read the other reader reviews and you'll see generally those who are experienced loved it, those new to trading wanting easy answers hated it / disappointed. <br />It is one of the few books I am reluctant to promote because I don't want the secrets in it to get out - ha! oh well hopefully most people won't get it.	2002-06-30

I am so glad this book has been written I hope it makes kettles more popular and hence available!<br />This kind of workout will make you much much more functionally stronger - if you are looking to just pump up your muscles, look elsewhere. There is nothing wrong with pumping up your muscles however this kind of training will thicken and strengthen your tendons and ligaments because of the ever-changing stresses of the weight in motion, and believe me it feels a lot more real and complete than the mechanical motions of conventional weight lifting (actually I should say bodybuilding). <br />I am not having a go at the normal modern approach there is a lot to be said for many of the exercises still popular e.g squats, benchpress, deadlift, dips etc.. but these are all generally single line of motion and stop-start ... you will reap huge benefits from the dynamic motion of swinging kettlebells. <br />I look forward to adding this book to my extensive library of old world strongman books, and I recommend you take a look yourself. Look at all the other reader reviews, all positive! That has to be a good sign!<br />Good luck! Get strong!	2001-10-11

I thought mistake, bad foot work, wrong position elbow, what if attacker does this, telegraphed movement, approach from wrong side etc.. <br />However after thinking about it, compared to what other books are out there it is quite good. Certainly what I have learnt in my training I have NEVER seen in any book. For me KM was nothing new. It was a good read and interesting and gave me an insight into the psychology and social history behind its development. Maybe I should write a book  seriously, maybe I will. <br />Kjetil Moland you asked what techniques I advocate against guns, knives and sticks  I recommend techniques similar to Krav Maga  but when I saw the KM techniques I picked them apart, I forget that what I know is not widely practised. I made specific points in my other review. THERE ARE SHORTCOMINGS IN THE TECHNIQUES IN THE KRAV MAGA BOOK. If you cant pick up on them then you need more experience. Coat your practise knife in paint and see where you get cut. Karate, Taekwondo, Ju Jitsu, Judo, kickboxing, thaiboxing are inferior to KM for real world self defense (although Ju Jitsu should not have been too bad) they all have their own strengths but in all that I have seen of those you mentioned I have never seen adequate real world techniques taught. 4 of those you mentioned are purely sport and the other 2 are a combination of sport / traditions and none of them strictly taught without any pure real-world self defense practise are adequate for the real world  you should know that. <br />p24 Stab to the Stomach from the Side, Oriental Hold, Forearm defense. Anyone skilled with a knife will immediately twist withthe knife and slash the veins along your forearm, retreating and driving the blade down into your throat. Even if the attacker has no knife skills and just lunges at your stomach, you would be lucky if the knife was short enough to not hit you regardless. Either way you have put yourself in the path of the blade. Do you honestly believe that after blocking with your right forearm you are able to then move your right arm and grab the same position on the attackers wrist with your left hand while he stands there not moving? He has a huge knife, any movement he makes with his arm is leveraged with the length of the blade. Slash your forearm, hook it up into your armpit or bicep, not to mention your throat, the knife wielding attacker has the advantage of reach speed and leverage (not to mention the sharp edge) and the KM guy is basically saying dont stab my gut, stab my throat instead.<br />You would be far better off initially trapping the arm by deflecting it to your right, leaving you on the outside of the attacker (on his right hand side past his arm) and able to break his arm at the elbow or drive him down. <br />However after criticising that technique I will say this: what they show IS instinctive, simple, easy to apply even in for example a really crowded place with people all around, easy to learn, and most importantly could well save you especially if the person attacking you is just some ordinary guy with a knife trying to stab you, and not a trained killer (with a cool head, knife skills and a deliberate intent). More likely than not, if you practise these KM skills, then in that situation your trained reflexes will save you and give you the edge over the attacker (the last thing he would expect is a competant counter attack). <br />Also I would point out that many martial arts, if you had learnt them instead of KM, you would have the reflexes to block the initial stab but you probably would not instinctively grab the knife etc... like KM would teach you.  The traditional martial arts generally do not give adequate training for real world events. KM does fill the gap quite a bit. I am sorry if I seemed overly critical before but remember I didnt look at KM and think gee I never saw this before<br />If you do not think you can defend yourself against knives, guns, sticks (or grenades  something I hope I never encounter) then you would probably learn a great deal from this book  and then you must practise it a lot as realistically as you can. Get it, get a friend, practise practise practise  experience is the real key. Practise until it is second nature and then practise some more but with chaotic unpredictable opponents (not just rehearsing) (like the reviewer who mentioned going all-out with pads). Tell your partner: &quot;Take this knife and kill me or die.&quot;<br />Dip the practice knife in paint. Use a water pistol with food dye in it. Make no excuses. And dont go thinking KM is the be all end all just because youve never seen techniques like these before. Everyone loves to think their martial art is the best and to pretend to themselves that because their technique is superior they will be OK  dont fall in that trap, practise, learn what is useful and what works.<br />Good luck and may you never have to use these skills. <br />I also recommend Bouncers Guide to Barroom Brawling  - an accurate account of street fighting, however it does not have many illustration or specific techniques like Krav Maga does.	2001-08-18

This may be the case in Israel but sadly is not so in other parts of the world. <br />Now that is one insulting statement I just made so I had better elaborate. I did enjoy this book and it does have some value, I just worry it might be a bit dangerous especially for beginners.<br />It is quite well written, I did not find the photos difficult to understand like one reviewer here commented. As far as being a book is concerned it is quite well put together and good value. It is the actual techniques that are dodgy. <br />It really does assume the attacker is over committed, off balance or just plain stupid. Most of the Krav Maga counters are themselves very easy to counter, the Krav Maga guy putting himself in an off-balance, over committed position not to mention exposing himself in the most extreme ways. How does wrestling a gun so it points at your groin sound? No good? Alright, someone stabs at your midsection - lean forward as far as you can and offer them your throat. Provided they are a lunatic stabbing madly in religious fervour, you'll be fine. Although most people will simply stab you in the throat. <br />Many of the anti-gun and anti-knife moves approach from the open side instead of the blind side, telegraphing the move and prob. will leave you dead. Some of the anti-terrorist moves are likely to leave the poor hostage dead, usually from wrestling the gun so it points at yourself or the hostage. <br />I do not suggest trying to grab the barrel of a gun to stop it revolving and hence firing a second bullet: the first bullet will prob. kill you (as you've just wrestled the gun to point at a vital part of your body), the flash will burn your hand and many gunners oil their guns making it IMPOSSIBLEto hold it still. I know this from a friend with a burnt hand and a hole in his leg. You're better off jamming your hand in the hammer instead. The grenade tactics are OK but if you mistake a bomb trigger for a grenade, you're history. <br />Overall it is interesting (if brief) in its coverage of all these weapons such as grenades, machine guns etc... but not effective. In my opinion dangerously inadequate, very bad technique, unfoundered on actual experience. Again, these are insulting statements so I would like to point out that the \\"real life examples\\" they use to justify their techniques are garbage stories like \\"when the grand master was 13 his brother pulled a gun on him and he hit it and it went off and he was unhurt\\" and stuff like that. NOT real life examples of combat for life and death on the street, just idiots stuffing around and accidents, they neglect to mention that the REASON the gun went off in those examples was BECAUSE they hit it. Just plain stupid. The obvious lack of experience astounds me.<br />The reason Israel is not known for its martial arts is because they are really really bad. I find it difficult to believe anything in this book would stand up to anyone other than a person standing still for the photo. However I did enjoy reading it - it makes you think about your existing skills, it gives an insight into another M.A culture, it is interesting for any instructors out there with spare time and money to have a look. <br />But for ~anyone~ who wants to learn serious self defense techniques this is absolutely NOT the book to get, stay away unless you are already experienced and just want an interesting read. I hope I have not offended anyone with this review - if I have then don't get mad at me, get some other skills and compare them for yourself.	2001-08-08

Not for me particularly but I can easily see how many reviewers had trouble - at times long winded or even pretentiously worded, where simplicity and eloquence would have served better. Perhaps the author goes out of his way to sound grand - needlessly - at the expense of readability for some and comprehension for others.<br />Now that 1st paragraph of mine is an example of babbling on unnecessarily and annoying people, as used in the book. <br />Having said that, there is substance in this book, there are even specific scans to use / implement / program, you do have to work at it though, but if you do that you won't come away saying &quot;what a waste of time.&quot; <br />It is also very &quot;negative&quot; (realistic - sobering) in the beginning, talking about the many ways to mess up your trades and lose money, perhaps this negative tone might be disillusioning for some people but then again, so many other books have a stupidly optimistic tone to get readers chanting success and rush in with untested systems: to lose money. <br />Overall I think a very worthwhile book, but you will have to work at it, if you are a complete beginner then get yourself some experience + intro. books first or this will drive you nuts. <br />Might be an idea to get your hands on one and read a bit before buying.<br />Good luck!	2001-05-09

E.g the moroccan rice recipe, called for some spices I did not have, and an apple which I also did not have when I first did it. The teriyaki spare ribs - well, naturally they call for some Japanese ingredients, but I've made them with none of the fancy ingredients in fact I did not even sit them to marinate - I just cooked them and poured the liquids over them, delicious! lol <br />In fact if I want to cook say a stew, I just look at the recipes now to get some idea of what to do, and throw everything in. There is nothing to it. <br />This is not the most basic pressure cookbook, not the &quot;sauce, meat, vege&quot; type cooking. But people, it is sooo much simpler than some of the crazy gourmet ones I have, with the most exotic ingredients, where some of the ingredients are other RECIPES from earlier in the book .... this book is somewhere in between and a very comfortable medium.<br />Like I said, it is the one I use all the time.  I eat at some of the best restraunts in the country, and you know, sometimes they can't come close to the hearty home cooked meal I can whip up in 30 minutes. Now I'm hungry, and its 2am ...	2001-04-04

Apart from a breakdown of all the aeroplanes and a beautiful poster of them, it shows you how to do some really excellent combat aerobatics - with illustrations and descriptions right down the the throttling e.g &quot;use 3/4 throttle and no more or you'll risk stalling the plane&quot; ... <br />And tells you how to shoot at an angle to which you are travelling by sliding the plane at a 5 degree angle - which is substantially better than crashing into the slow moving zeppelin you are trying to shoot to pieces like I used to ! <br />Now that section alone is worth the price of the book. The author, I see, is an actual experienced pilot (and perhaps fanatic!) and knows what he is talking about. <br />It helps lift the game to a whole new level, because it will give you the technical knowledge and the base skills required to fill the boots of Nathan Zachary. <br />I also recommend a good joystick, I use a force feedback which makes it more difficult to hold steady but hey - good! A nice touch of realism. <br />This would make an excellent present also, anyone who likes this game would very much enjoy the book as well.	2001-04-01

It sheds light on some of the shonky / cunning / not what you expected behaviour of big names of the past - and present. <br />Reading this will give you a perspective on a plunging market that will allow you to:<br />1. get out quick smart 2. if you didn't get out quick smart, to get out but not feel like too much of a fool 3. to know when to get out 4. when to get back in again<br />Most importantly it will help you make money, rather than lose money. <br />I am afraid this review does not do the book justice, so in summary: just get it, if you cannot afford this little book you CERTAINLY cannot afford to have anything to do with the market, furthermore, it is very good reading, good information, depth of perspective, a respected author and by far one of the best stock books I have read, and I have read many many stock books.<br />PS: it is also quite funny in parts.	2001-01-23

There aren't any. <br />This book is worth  ever dollar. Many other books make TA seem so complicated, difficult.  Furthermore, it gives a much deeper understanding of what it explains, many  other books simply tell you something but you don't learn why, how, what to  do if there is a variance, etc etc you get the idea. <br />It is a huge book  and very well presented. The graphs are well located to the text, easy to  understand, each with its own detailed annotations directly underneath as  well as references in the text.<br />It is recently updated, and might I say  ~thoroughly~ updated, it has a section on Japanese Candlesticks which makes  obsolete a previous book I bought (by the same author, looks like he pasted  most of it in this book). Look at the contents, it covers most everything,  including Elliot Wave theory. They have done an excellent job at updating  it.<br />There are other TA &quot;Bible&quot; books out there, classic  masterpieces, which are very good, however the recent updates made to this  one, combined with its easy to read, learn and wonderful presentation make  this the winner. <br />If you get one book on TA, get this one. It is worth  the money. You will save money in three ways: <br />1. if you get another book  instead, you won't have to purchase this one later when you realise how  lacking the other one is (or worse, buy several trying to fill knowledge  gaps)<br />2. you will make better trades<br />3. you will save time, learning  faster<br />I really cannot emphasise how well the concepts are explained.  This is a class act all the way, I highly recommend it, I cannot believe  there are not 80+ positive reviews, I guess all the other TA people out  there either want tokeep the knowledge to themselves or are too lazy.  <br />If you already own a previous version of this book, I would even  recommend getting this latest one as well.<br />Also I recommend The  Disciplined Trader, Candlesticks by Nison.<br />Good luck!	2000-09-07

And yes  there are spelling mistakes and things, but don't worry about that.<br />The  information is first class. I highly recommend this to a beginner because  it will give you a good grounding on truth in bodybuilding, and techniques  that work. Honestly, if you are a beginner, pretty much anything you do  will get great results (and hopefully not injury - get a book on weight  training technique if you don't get this one), so don't get all wrapped up  in any specific system just because it gives you good results when you  start out. The information in this book is as good as any you'll find and  covers all topics (except you should also get a really good nutrition  book).<br />Polloquin Principles is a bit basic - now it has a lot more  information than many other books, but Polloquin has a lot more tricks and  techniques than just what is in this book, it is a shame he does not do a  part II with all his many many tricks. For example, if you exercise a  bodypart in the morning, then again 6 hours later, you will have a major  neurological advantage because in those 6 hours your nervous system  overcompensates, giving you major strength opportunity later in the day for  the same muscle group. He has many obscure tricks like this and I wish he  would write them all down!<br />However this book is more like a good, solid,  overall book. The beginning covers basics, then workouts, things like reps  and volume and stuff. Then, it goes through every major muscle group (legs,  back, arms etc..) and tells you the most productive, most important  exercises to do, how to do them. <br />It is a good foundationbook, essential  for beginners and intermediate, and even advanced (although by now you have  prob. encountered just about everything already). <br />Note it is not only  for bodybuilding but if your aim is to gain strength, or sport conditioning  as well. <br />And I highly recommend it for women as well. Don't think all  this is just for men, women and girls have got a lot more to get out of  weightlifting than men do if you ask me.	2000-09-04

It was wonderful. <br />The reason I did not give it 5 stars  is because I believe some full colour photos of the meals would be nice ...  although, at the same time, might detract from the wonderful country feel  of the book. <br />I would say this is a very good present for anyone remotely  interested in anything Celtic + cooking, it has a wonderful feel to it,  warm, enchanting, entertaining you can actually browse through the little  tidbits.	2000-09-03

Design your own bench	OK where do I start ....<br />This is a great book. Inspirational. Great photos and illustrations, well written, fascinating history, deep insight  into the various uses of benches and the techniques of holding workpieces.  <br />I bought this to inspire the design of my own bench.<br />Now this book  might not be for everyone, so I am breaking this review into  bits:<br />Beginner: will educate you to the history of woodworking and  inspire you. Making your own bench is probably beyond you at the moment. If  you have a love of woodworking, this will fire your enthusiasm.<br />Novice:  can give you ideas for the future. There are sketches in this book, but not  plans, especially not detailed router diagrams with measurements.  <br />Intermediate: (you can design your own projects) get it. You should  seriously consider making your own workbench, to your own requirements and  style. This book will show you many possibilities and get your  thinking.<br />Advanced: well you should definetely get it, and make yourself  a variety of benches to suit different applications. <br />I really enjoy this  book. I have designed my own bench with the many, many ideas from this  book. I have many innovative concepts, and specific requirements - for  example, I carry my bench into the courtyard, and so have a hole in the  middle where I can put a beach umbrella to keep the sun off (not to mention  fact that it must be light enough to lift). I also work with leather,  jewelry, metal, and beads, so I need adaptability for hammering, soldering,  velvet lining to prevent beads escaping, etc etc you get the  picture.<br />This book gave me many many ideas for various means of clamping  a work to the bench .. things that I can make myself, which is great. For  example, there is a detailed diagram for cutting your own woodscrew, to  build your own vice. <br />Hmmm... a bit of a warning to power tool users,  however, this is not really aimed at power tool users. The benches are  designed for traditional woodwork, although the techniques are still useful  for you if you want to build yoru own router bench. <br />Note there are  benches for carving as well, Japanese approaches, medieval benches  ...<br />Overall I am very pleased with this book and I would recommend to  anyone. Furthermore, I would recommend it as a present, I don't know anyone  who works with wood who would not be pleased with this one, although as a  present I would first recommend some of the books such as Art of Fine Tools  or the Handplane book. <br />Note that I bought this book as part of the boxed  set, which is excellent value and you save on shipping since it is one item  not 3.	2000-08-31

I bought others which were cheaper, even though many reviews pointed towards Nisons' work. Note that in  Australia, we are talking about $35 (other books) compared to $150 (Nison's  book) ... so anyway, after buying many others, and looking all over the  'net for info. on Candlesticks, I ran into Nisons' book in a shop, looked  through it and had to have it.<br />It has a LOT LOT LOT more depth than the  others. There is more to candlesticks (or any price movement analysis) than  just a bunch of patterns, names, formations ... the other books are far far  too brief. I cannot emphasise this enough. <br />Look at all the other reviews  for this book, many many good words said.<br />It is very readable, very  clear, the examples are excellent, but most valuable are the insights for  all the patterns ... that other books simply do not have. <br />Sure, it costs  a bit more than the other candlestick books, but hey, how much money are  you trading? Does an extra 30 or 50 bucks make that much difference for the  extra insight you will gain? <br />This is not just the best ~Candlestick~  book, but it is a very very good TA book as well. Candlesticks are, after  all, just a way of plotting price movements. <br />Note that, in searching the  web for info. on TA and investing, this book came up time and time again as  ~highly~ recommended. Now I pass that recommendation on.<br />Note also Nison  has another book, &quot;Beyond Candlesticks&quot;, and while I think that  this is also a good book, get this one first and learn it all, the second  book concentrates more on a few &quot;Advanced&quot; techniques, I don't  know if they are so much advanced as they are just a few more techniques +  brushing over what is in the first book. Get this first book, because it  has more depth on the essentials that you need to know. Get the other book  later, don't try and save money by jumping to the second one in the hope it  will make the first obsolete, don't try and save money by getting a cheaper  candlestick book, don't brush this stuff off thinking you've learnt all the  candlestick stuff just by seeing a couple of patterns and names.<br />I also  highly recommend Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets, this is  recently updated and so incredibly good.<br />Beginner trader: will help you a  lot, a very good investment, but also look to the book recommended  above.<br />Intermediate: what are you doing? making a profit? get the book.  Not making a profit? get the book, or get out of trading.<br />Advanced: why  don't you have it? it should be on everyone's bookshelf, have you no pride?  can't you afford it? <br />This is one of those trading books you cannot  afford not to have. I don't give that rating to many other trading  books.<br />Good luck!<br />Oh, and it is enjoyable to read.	2000-08-19

The nitty gritty, behind the scenes and all in a  very well organised, highly readable manner.<br />I believe even a complete  beginner could learn a lot from this, although if you are a beginner you  might be overwhelmed at first by the sheer volume of the whole book, you  will find that you can take one relevant section at a time.<br />For experts,  I am sure you will find something of value in every chapter, for us it is  like a fascinating casual read, and may reveal things that have mystified  you all these years.<br />Finally it is very up to date.<br />- TOTAL BEGINNER :  good, but you might need some sort of visual guide first, or tutoring.<br />-  BEGINNER and INTERMEDIATE : you will learn a lot from this book.<br />-  EXPERIENCED : discover what has really been going on in the background all  this time.<br />- EXPERT : probably do not NEED this book, probably know a lot  already, but I think you will enjoy it nonetheless, and as it covers so  many areas it might round you out in ways you did not expect.<br />- DEVELOPER  : could provide inspirations, and you know what they're worth.	2000-08-07

This book will make you laugh  at yourself, and may help you make better decisions instead of getting  caught up in spite, anger, frustration, aggravation. For that reason it is  very valuable. <br />You won't find trading strategies or anything like that  in it though, it is a comedy book.<br />I think it would make a great present  for anyone who trades, I know that if someone bought it for me as a present  I would be exceptionally pleased, there are hundreds of uncontrollable  laughs in this book, and that is good for your heart.<br />I realise it is  quite pricey, but I've paid more to see movies that weren't nearly as funny  as this little gem.<br />Uh-oh, market's closing, gotta go......	2000-08-07

I would more accurately give this book 3 1/2 stars ...I am a firm believer in Candlestick charting - not because it is foolproof, and not for some mystical ancient timeless qualities it possesses in predicting stocks. <br />The simple fact  is, it is much easier to recognise patterns by looking at a  &quot;candle&quot; rather than looking at the western plot (which I find  visually confusing, especially if the graphs are cramped). Using  candlesticks has its flaws but overall I think it is a good way to view  price data. <br />The book: a bit light, however substantially more depth than  anything I have found for free on the web, and I have found a lot. The book  takes a pattern, shows you what is likely to happen next, explains  deviations from normal and also tells you to what degree confirmation  recommended. It is easy to use as reference.<br />It gave me enough  information to create my own computerised candlestick recognition software  .. the book also contains statistics from their own software, e.g the  percentage of times they found &quot;hammers&quot; or &quot;doji&quot;  patterns - this was interesting.  <br />I chose this book over the work by  Nison because it was 1. cheaper and 2. it was recommended on an investor  site as being better organised than Nisons' work ... and it is very well  organised. Also nobody really grilled it in a review. <br />However, I still  plan to purchase the books by Nison to expand my understanding ... that  does not mean this is a bad book, I just want more information. I would  want an entire book just on the fascinating history of the ancient inventor  of candlesticks, Sakata, what a character. I would not mind reading a  translation of his work. Also I would like more insights into the  psychological interpretations.<br />I recommend taking a look at this book and  at Nisons', and deciding then. It is quite a good book. But don't expect  any one book to give you everything you need to become a successful trader,  that will take perspective, experience and a watchful eye.	2000-07-25
US	50235120	R2Y4GK5MT7SD5A	1561581259	668857066	The Complete Guide to Sharpening	Books	5	220	220	N	N	Fantastic, definitive and best book on sharpening, ESSENTIAL	Ooooh what a book ...<br />All the positive reviews made me want to know more, so I asked about it at a local woodworking shop and they said, &quot;This is THE best book on sharpening.&quot; <br />It is essential to have  sharp tools, I do all my work with handtools but the book goes into great  detail on ALL tools, machines, different shapes of tools, the advantages of  different techniques ... great detail, but it is also concise, VERY easy to  read and understand, and has excellent placement of photos within the text  - if you are reading about something on page 30 the pictures will be on  page 30, not page 29, not page 35. Also the large pages are broken up  nicely with tidbits of fascinating historical and scientific information.  In parts, I actually laughed out loud!<br />There are electron microscope  photographs of the edges of blades that have been sharpened using various  methods. You can actually see the effects ... you will gain appreciation of  lapping and rust prevention ... you will know how to select good tools,  good sharpening aids ... you will learn about the structure of wood and how  to cut with a blade. <br />Part of the way through it I thought, &quot;this is  great, but I wish it told me how to sharpen my kitchen knives&quot; -  wholah! in a few pages it did, it showed me how to use that stupid thing  that came with the set of knives, and the method worked very well.<br />I  could not be more pleased with this book. I highly recommend it to anyone  interested in sharpening, especially woodworkers, these are essential  skills. Sharp tools will enhance your entire woodwork experience. You will  produce finer work with greater ease, even if you use mostly power  tools.<br />I give it 6 stars out of 5.<br />If it had all colour photos and was  bound in leather, I would give it 10 out of 5 AND it would be a fantastic  coffee table book as well (warning: that does not mean it is insubstantial,  just that many non-woodworking visitors would very much enjoy it)	2000-07-25

A Must have	I ~highly~ recommend this book!<br />I would pay the price of the book just for a single serving of any one of the recipes I have made so far.<br />The food I cook for myself at home using these recipes is as good as any  restraunt. Sure, when I prepare a meal it is not as neatly presented as in  a classy restraunt, but these pressure cooker meals are many times more  hearty, more satisfying.<br />My favorite recipes so far: Hungarian Goulash,  BBQ Pork Chops, Spaghetti Bolognese, Grand Champ Chili. Tomorrow I'll be  trying Teriyaki Spare Ribs. What will you be eating?<br />If you are thinking  of getting a pressure cooker cookbook, this is a very good one. Divided  into sections, I have listed the sections and number of recipes in each  section here: <br />Soups 13, Meats and Poultry 19, Stews and one-dish meals  12, Fish and Seafood 7, Vegetables 7, Rice Beans Pasta 11, Sauces 5,  Desserts 10<br />The recipes are easy to follow even for a complete beginner,  not like some recipes I have seen in other books that are just way too much  work. Furthermore, the pressure cooker is probably the only washing up you  will need to do.<br />I would say that, from this book, you will cook at least  one of the meals every week for evermore. <br />If you have a pressure cooker,  get this book!  If you don't have a pressure cooker, GET ONE they are the  future of home cooking.	2000-07-03

I believe  the hardcover would be much better, especially if you are giving it as a  gift. <br />It is a good book. There are many, many beautiful illustrations  throughout, making it a great gift. It has many useful techniques to help  you shift your thinking. <br />I hope you get it, enjoy it and learn ...	2000-07-03

Don't expect  a list of do this, do that, if customer says this, then say that, prepare a sales line etc..<br />This book is about the ~opposite~ of that.<br />Read it with a  sense of what is possible, and a sense of being flexible .. and you will  get many ideas about how you can go about your selling more effectively ..  take what you already know and make it better ... <br />Selling and persuading  .. <br />Do you feel guilty? nervous? anxious? tongue tied?  this may help  change your perceptions .. helping you to sell feelings along with the  product, something you do anyway.<br />If you want a list of things to do,  read the book and write out ideas as you read it, and wholah! a  list!<br />Finally, there are other reviewers who did not like the book, and  so I will say it is not for everyone, but the only way you will know if it  can give you a great edge is to read it.	2000-06-15

And I mean great success, and it has a cult following, so there must be some value in it. <br />Many of their conclusions  are wrong. Just plain wrong. <br />For a start, some humans HAVE to eat meat,  some humans are primarily carnivorous. And others are very much vegetarian  - that is their genetic makeup. <br />I am sick of people concluding from  their own physical makeup that ALL humans are one or the other, most are a  mixture. For you personally, try to find what works for you.<br />Example of  their stupid conclusions: &quot;humans should not eat meat, because meat  eating creatures like dogs, cats, lions etc.. have high acid content in  their stomach, and humans don't&quot;. Well, derrr those animals don't just  eat meat, they eat BONE and SINEW. Might I remind the authors that many  purely vegetarian animals they admire so much like the cows have multiple  stomachs ? <br />So apart from &quot;the world should be  vegetarian&quot; nonsense that insults you .... like I said, some people  have great great success with this book. But don't buy into their  reasonings ....	2000-06-15

Bandler is a genius face to face. He has many great books. <br />But some of that is lost when putting things into words in the form of a  story, I don't think he has the talent Milton had ... <br />This is a weird  book. I found some things of great value in it, however my advice is this:  if you have already a collection of Bandlers' works, get this. If not, or  if you have no experience with him, do NOT get it - it might turn you  off.<br />OK?	2000-06-15
