US	49429603	R3E9ZSF5MVKY9A	0425203506	177969128	Vigil	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Angelus Interruptus	This book showed promise. It started well with engaging characters and a mysterious object that you just couldn't wait to find out about. Then, the object is revealed and nothing much else happens. A story that could have gone somewhere and went nowhere. Of course, the end is set up for a sequel but I'm sure I'll be skipping that one. It's a shame that authors can't seem to find anything good to do with fallen angels. It seems like a subject that could yield fertile and satisfying results but so far, all the books I've read on the subject have been disappointing. No one seems to be able to make the angels fly.	2005-07-14

Although a little shaken at first that the vamps are not your typical ones, (these are from space) the book grabbed my attention and I raced through it. The ending was disappointing only because I didn't want it to end. It was a little difficult investing in the life of Valentine but as the story progressed I found myself liking him more and more. In the end, when love motivates him to heroic deeds, he becomes more human and thus, the ultimate warrior against the hordes of galactic vamps.

Having a djinni serve a young magician is a great idea but the author does nothing with it. The djinni does nothing exciting with his powers and the young boy magician is a snivelling bore. It seems many are trying to write the new \\"Harry Potter.\\" Many are trying and many are failing...but they're getting published anyway. A total mystery to me. So, avoid this book and look for your young adult fantasy elsewhere.	2004-05-27

I've been a fan of he and Child for a long time, although I've been disapointed with their last few books. Although not disappointed with &quot;Codex,&quot; I found it to be so-so. It suffers from a predictable plot and characters. You know the two leads, thrust together into a high intensity situation, are going to fall for each other. You know that they will find what they are looking for. You know the bad guy is going to meet his doom in the end. An enjoyable read but nothing special. It distresses me a bit to think that all the writers that work in the thriller genre (Preston/Child, Matthew Reilly, Steve Alten, James Rollins) are all copying each other. &quot;Codex&quot; seems to have elements in common with &quot;Temple,&quot; &quot;Amazonia,&quot; and &quot;Domain.&quot; They all harken back to &quot;Congo&quot; by the original thriller writer, Crichton. I hope they can all break their wave of familiarity and come up with some fresh ideas soon. I'm aching for a great story.	2004-02-14

I thought the combination of dinosaurs and time-travel would be a winning combination. That's what I get for thinking. The plot was boring and a bit far-fetched for my tastes. There's a certain level of believability that I like and this one didn't fall within the parameters. The characters were dull or irritating. The dino encounters were lackluster. The plot was, to me, a bit silly. The sub-plots, even sillier. I would be more specific but it would require me to give away plot points in the book.

That said, \\"Ice Hunt\\" is not one of his best. While it has its moments, I had a sense of deja vu while reading it. In a sense, I felt like I was reading \\"Ice Station\\" by Matthew Reilly again. I love both authors but their choices can be a bit \\"odd\\" at times. Rollins has chosen as his monster a pack of walking whales. Below (or is it above) that is a plot about human experimentation in cryogenics. So...we have our civilian heroes struggling between American black ops, Russian troops, and some kind of Moby Dick on land. (Land Shark anyone?) Rollins has done better work.

Not so with this book. One would need a chart to keep up with the characters as they zip back and forth in time. But my main problem with the book is not the overly complex time travel/paradox angle but the authors sheer wrongness about certain things and the sheer ridiculousness of some of the characters actions. In one sequence, a band of scientists are stranded in time and one of them dies. Finding a \\"New Testament\\" in her bag, they begin to try to choose a verse to read at the funeral. Their choices include a passage from Genesis and another from Psalms, two Old Testament books that would not be included in a New Testament. Sometime later, the scientists build a house and proceed to, after a night of singing hokey songs, have an orgy. Necessary? I think not. It's not that I'm a prude, I just found the entire action to be stupid and totally unnecessary for the story. I invested 200 pages of my time into this book. It was a waste of time. I wish I had a time machine so I could go back and not have bought it.	2003-07-27

It's annoying to me that King is considered the &quot;Master of Horror&quot; and McCammon has quit writing due to frustrations with the publishing industry. Swan Song is one of McCammon's best. I've read it twice now and it never fails to satisfy. Is it perfect? No. Is it involving? You betcha! McCammon's take on the &quot;end-of-the-world&quot; is a winner. The character's are satisfyingly strange, quirky yet lovable. Perhaps the biggest down side to this novel is that it seems a bit dated. It has an 80's sensibility to it, so much so that you could actually visualize it being an 80's movie directed by John Carpenter (in his heyday, of course) Warts and all, this is a fun book to read.

In this book, Harry has werewolf troubles and we soon find out there are different types of the beasties. All the different types come crashing out of the woodwork around Harry and he must battle his way out of some hairy situations. The supernatural/detective/fantasy angle of the stories is really well done. I've started &quot;Grave Peril&quot; and love it so far. The books seem to get darker and better as Butcher goes along.

My only complaint, of course, would be that every religious novel and movie revolves around Catholicism. Why don't the Methodists and the Southern Baptists get equal billing? Seriously, this book is an incredible thriller, a tour guide to Rome, and an educational adventure all rolled into one. I've never learned so much from a work of fiction. Being an art major in college, I appreciated so much the references to art from the Renaissance. I think the book suffers a bit from Crichtonism. That being defined as &quot;when an author can't decide what to do at the end so he throws out the most ludicrous thing he can think of.&quot; Let's just say one thing at the end stretched my ability to suspend disbelief just a tad too much.

It's a fun and sometimes gory romp through the adventures of a wizard/detective. Set in the real world, the book overcame my dislike of pure fantasy. Dresden interacts with supernatural characters but the grit and grime of today's society are part of what he's fighting. I disagree with the review saying Dresden is inept and he's always dropping his wand. I don't think this person read the book. Dresden is a likable character and his use of magic is believable (in a suspension of disbelief sort of way). I'm 3/4 through \\"Fool Moon\\" and plan on reading the entire series. I'm not saying this is Shakespeare but it is a fun world to dive into for an enjoyable read. It's nice to see a wizard finally show his real power and use it. So many wizards in fiction use their powers in subtle ways. Aren't there many of us out here who want to see the Gandolphs and the Merlins just totally kick butt? In this book, the wizard gets to. Kudos to Jim Butcher for a great series.	2003-03-28

What could have been a killer \\"coming-of-age\\" thriller was nothing more than a \\"B\\" movie with a weak plot. Why do horror writers keep rehashing the same themes over and over with no freshness. (Haunted schools, cursed objects, and burrowing creatures of unspeakable horror that take over the bodies of dead people) It's all been done before. If only writers like Simmons would explain the circumstances behind the supernatural occurrences rather than letting them just happen, leaving us to scratch our heads and go, \\"What?\\" Keep digging Dan.

I don't think there's an author out there with better premises for books than he but when you get into the heart of the story you find that he's done nothing creative with it. If throwing one odd thing after another at you is creativity, sign me up. Strangewood could have been such an awesome book but instead it's a mess. The story's potential for excellence declines the further you trod into it. The characters are shallow cliches and the conclusion is predictable. All of the books I've read by Golden are the same. Great ideas written badly. I want to give him another chance. I think he has potential but...I just don't know if I can waste my time and money on this author anymore.	2002-12-13

Several times, I thought of putting it down but it finally grabbed me. Most books fizzle by the last third. This one takes off like a UFO! The ending didn't grab me but it makes me think he may be thinking of writing another one.

The descriptions I had read were leading me to the adventure of a lifetime. That didn't happen. What happened was I read an okay book about some high school friends who suddenly find themselves in a real-life, twisted Neverland. The adolescent angst story was good but when they found themselves in Neverland, it went too crazy too fast. There should have been a bit of reality that follows them into the Neverland. Or perhaps there wasn't enough of a buildup of fantasy to make us truly believe we've plunged into a violent, bloody Oz. If the transition had been smoother, the book would have been more enjoyable. As for Golden, his style is very readable and I plan to give him another chance. I've started the &quot;Shadows Saga&quot; and I hope it lives up to it's hype. &quot;Straight On 'Til Morning&quot; did not.	2002-04-22

I usually love tales of alternate history and this one had potential. I was disapointed to find that it's only an average read. The Ripper, evil as he is, is portrayed as no more than an English fop. The hero, Trevor, gives new meaning to the word fickle as he tromps from one adventure to another. The whole story seems disjointed. I found myself scanning a lot. Laymon seems obsessed with adolescence and the sexual obsessions thereof. I haven't read a book of his where some teenagers glands weren't percolating with lust.

Should a Christian's art be obviously Christian or is there room to fudge a bit? These and many other types of questions are answered by Turner. Perhaps the greatest insight he shares in the book is that a Christian artist is also a human being. The art created by this person is affected by all things in their environment. To create only art that reflects an inflexible spiritual message is ludicrous. If the artist is touched by the power of God, the artist paints it. If the artist is hurt by a lover's rejection, the artist writes a song about it. If the artist likes french toast, the artist writes a short story about it. Christian themed or not, it's art and it's justified. Let the fundamental, backward thinking, Super Christians beware. Steve Turner is a champion for the cause of Christians in the arts.	2002-04-04

Taylor Field and his family are shining examples of servant evangelism. They moved out of their comfort zone to love the unloved in the harsh streets of NYC. There are not too many of those people who call themselves ministers who would do such a thing. If you read the Bible (and I mean really read it) you'll find that Jesus didn't stand in a pulpit, wearing a designer suit, shouting at the world to &quot;get saved or suffer the fires of hell.&quot; No, he walked among us, loved us, touched us, helped us, and eventually, died for us. Field has taken the challenges Jesus set before us to heart and this book tells his (unfinished) story. I myself have ministered on the streets of NY. It's tough. (I was only there 2 weeks) Field lives there. He walks among them, loves them, touches them and helps them. Something tells me he would die for them.

The story; disapointing. Give the &quot;Killer Virus&quot; genre a rest for a bit and skip reading this book.	2001-06-17
US	49429603	R2P5HMTMJ9GHGZ	0762409487	392730696	The Writer's Block: 786 Ideas to Jump-Start Your Imagination	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Good Things Come In Small Packages	This is the best writer's tool I've ever seen. The prompts are provoking and the short snippets about writers and their craft are wonderful. Don't buy anymore of those high brow books that you have to buy another book just to understand. Get this little gem instead. It's well worth the inexpensive price.	2001-06-13

This book is a grown-up, deadly serious adult version of the movie &quot;The Goonies.&quot; Basically a treasure hunt story, it pumps up the action with it's modern day spin of hunting for an impossible to get to treasure with today's technology. As escapist reading goes, this is a real keeper.	2001-05-03

Wow. That's about as exciting as grouting my tub. This book had nothing. Dull characters, zero plot and the worst ending I think I've ever read.	2001-03-28
