This one rates with Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment. Fascinating characters, great story, interesting twists, authentic dialoge that rings true. At times, you may believe you're reading an autobiography.<br />Also well researched. It is apparent that Wally Lamb did his homework on paranoid schizophrenics, the relationships of twins, and more. Hope to read it again.<br />There's a valid reason why over 1000 people have rated it at 4 1/2 stars. Take the plunge! Read the book!!!!	2001-03-24

Eleven-year-old Bobby Garfield lives with his widowed, controlling, miserly mother in an apartment. Life is humdrum for Bobby until an older neighbor Ted moves in upstairs. Bobby's mother is highly skeptical and suspicious of Ted, and warns Bobby to keep his distance from this new neighbor. In time, Ted introduces Bobby to ''Lord of the Flies'' Bobby grows to admire Ted, despite Ted's &quot;problem&quot; Ted tells Bobby that he is being pursued by  &quot;Low men in yellow coats&quot;  He hires Bobby to be his sentry, watching for signs of their presence-- lost-pet notices, stray kite tails, upside-down supermarket flyers, etc.<br />Low Men is the best part of this whole book. But just as the story really starts to develop, WHAM! It turns a corner and goes straight off a cliff.<br />&quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;, or story #2 revolves around a dormitory of several pathetic University of Maine college students whose lives are being consumed by the card game of Hearts. Bobby Garfield doesn't exist in this, the largest segment of the book at all. Several new characters are introduced, and we focus on their addiction to this card game, which is keeping them from studying, sleeping, bringing down their grades, flunking out of school and into the Vietnam War...YAWN...it's unimaginable how much time King wasted on this silly story. It reads like a high school English Lit. essay.<br />King's voice is so overwhelming in this segment, that I honestly thought he had shifted from fiction to autobiography. Like many Baby Boomers, King wallows in nostalgia, and reminisces about his generation. He says:<br />&quot;I like lots of people our age when they're one by one, but I loathe and despise my generation. We had an opportunity to change everything. We actually did. Instead, we settled for designer jeans, two tickets to Mariah Carey at Radio City Music Hall, frequent-flier miles, James Cameron's Titanic, and retirement portfolios. The only generation even close to us in pure, selfish self-indulgence is the so-called Lost Generation of the twenties, and at least most of them had the decency to stay drunk. We couldn't even do that.&quot;<br />In the book's two short stories, Willie Shearman &quot;Blind Willie&quot; takes the train from his comfy house and loving wife in the suburbs, to the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral where he transforms from mild mannered Willie Shearman, into begging Blind Willie. He leads a double life, as passersby don't realize Shearman's sight is intact.<br />The final story features a revisiting character, John Sullivan (Sully) whose haunted, literally, by the war. Plagued with feelings of guilt of a murdered Vietnamese woman, readers discover that Sullivan is frequently visited by her, yet she says nothing, only staring at him.<br />So what's wrong with this book? The separate stories are connected by small threads, a character here, a baseball glove there, but have no real unifying purpose, and lead to nowhere of any significant meaning.  I found his characters to be unbelievable. At times it reads very slow, with pointless detail, or story that serves no purpose.<br />I get the feeling that Mr. King is trying to make the transition from Horror story teller, to a Dickens or Faulkner novelists, but instead falls into a chasm. The ending is abrupt, leaving many questions unanswered, and many readers like me disappointed.  Maybe King plans to put the missing pieces together in another book?two tickets to Mariah Carey at Radio City Music Hall, frequent-flier miles, James Cameron's Titanic, and retirement portfolios.

There is so little story to this story, that the illustrations are the only worthy feature.<br />It's about the giants who stole Lord Buckley, crowned him their king and took him to their home, where he was lonely, he sends a message to his home, where Sir Joshua comes to the rescue,etc., etc.,etc. The story reads like the preceding run-on sentence.

My 4 year old was quickly bored, because the story dwells on a topic that is not interesting for young story listeners--learning to read. My 6 year old was mildly interested, but there are too many books that she'd rather have read to her. The illustrations are as good as you'll see for a childrens book, but that alone can't salvage a dull story, that only a select age group will pay attention to.	2000-09-26

It seems to capture all of the elements of a typical reunion--the abundant good food, the old folks reminiscing, the children playing--but it avoids excessive detail that will bore young story listeners. Johnson has a way of saying so much, with so few words, that children are likely to enjoy this story.	2000-09-26

Knowledge is power, so I would advise readers to prepare themselves for what may be the biggest investment of their lives. I read it five years ago, and find that it is still very relevant today.<br />It covers topics such as: Developing a financial strategy dealing with, and selecting real estate agents, sellers, attorneys, lenders, inspectors, escrow and title companies, deciding on a property, mobile homes, condominiums, country property, landlording, mortgages, offers and negotiating, closings, contingencies, etc.	2000-09-26

Based on an ancient Inuit myth, a grandfather tells his grandson the story of the caribou and the wolf. It explains the power of ecosystems--the wolf ferrits out the weakest caribou, which ultimately benefits the caribou, the wolf, and man. The book takes a complex topic, like Survival of the Fittest, and makes it understandable to children.<br />I read this story to my 4 &amp; 6 year-olds, and they understood it, and enjoyed it.

Sort of a long story about some house pets--Harold the dog, Chester the cat, Howie the small dog, and Bunnicula the rabbit--who are worried that someone is trying to break into their humans' house. They talk to each other in the story as they set up guard duty, and then try and solve the mystery of the missing fudge.<br />The story can be a little long for young ones, and there are multiple characters talking on various pages. This can be confusing to children listners if the reader parent/teacher doesn't seperate, or change the characters' voices--there are humans who also have dialoge--so children can easily identify who is talking. But, it's a fun story that ends happily, and if that's not enough, there is a recipe in the back of the book for Mr. Monroe's Famous Fudge!	2000-09-26

Both brothers, in need of food, worry more about the other brother's welfare. All turns out well in the end, and we're all better for having read this story!<br />This is a truely excellent story for children. The book only has one flaw, but it can be a big one with children. The illustrations are rather primitive, and don't seem to really capture the essence of the wonderful text. But the story is so good, it overshadows this flaw.

They are hungry, the baby is sick, and they're all tired from trying to keep the farm going.<br />But Jimmy's Uncle James is their savior. He will be coming to help out, and make things great. He has been logging out west, and writes the family of his many, incredible adventures. Only when Uncle James shows up, things aren't so great.

Probably best suited for 7-9 yrs? First, in fairness, it should be pointed out that the illustrations are top notch and, the story is certainly  interesting. It could've worked for my 4 and 6 yr olds, if the author  hadn't taken a left turn at the end, and made the story read like an Alfred  Hitchcock bedtime story for adults. It has a very TWILIGHT ZONE ending,  that will surely bring on the nightmares for younger children.<br />The story  revolves around Edward, a youngster settling down in bed for the night, who  is deluged with visions of scary dinosaur possibilites by his wacko, cruel,  older brother who shares the same bedroom with Edward.<br />There are so many  other childrens books that should be read before this one.

It seems to be more observational then as a  teaching tool.<br />Based on a passage from Henry David Thoreau's Walden, the  story is about Henry--the main animal character (bear?) in the story--and  his friend, who decide to go to Fitchburg. Henry chooses to walk the 30  miles, while his friend plans to work, so that he can earn enough money to  ride the train.

It read as if the author was trying to emulate Margaret Wise Brown  (Goodnight Moon), but falling far short of the mark.<br />I'd say it's  probably best for the 5-8 yrs audience, but I'm affraid they'll be bored.  3-4 yrs. won't get it.

There is a little boy  (Sean) and girl (Meghan), three very old ladies (the children's aunties),  and a leprechaun exchanging dialogue in the same 1 or 2 pages, at different  points throughout the book.<br />As a parent reading to a child, who wants to  present a different voice for each character so that the child can easliy  identify who is speaking in the story, there are too many characters  talking, but with no distinguishing personalities to make understanding  easier.<br />However, the story is somewhat entertaining despite its flaws.	2000-08-21

The first,  containing a vast history of Vietnam, which can be laborious to get  through, yet for history buffs, worth the effort. Second, the Vietnam  War.<br />It is the second part of the book which will leave the readers awed  by the ineptness and corruption of U.S. &amp; South Vietnamese  leadership--both military and political, especially at top levels--angry by  the uninformedness of the American people, and shocked by the great cost in  lives and property to two warring groups, whose involvement and happening  was entirely preventable.<br />Probably no other person was, or is better  qualified to write the Vietnam story than Stanley Karnow, who lived in  Paris in the 1950's, as a U.S. foreign news correspondent during France's  fight for dominance in Vietnam. He also interviewed numerous key  participants. He dug into once classifed U.S. documents to reveal unknown  information, and he researched and reported on the recollections of  high-level polticians, dignataries, military leaders, and the soldiers,  men, and women who fought on both sides.<br />An outstanding work!<br />I'd  recommed reading &quot;Paris in the Fifties&quot; by the same author as a  primer to this book.	2000-08-21

It is not depressing, but it is more of a learning experience for children readers  that is easily understood as they're able to empathize with a troubled  little boy whose father has died.<br />The illustrations are keen and exhibit  people dressed in exotic nineteenth-century Madagascar clothing.<br />I read  the story to my four and six-year-olds, and they, as I, loved it!	2000-06-16

I've read numerous job hunting books, but this one offers the unique perspective of the authors' experiences as recruiters. With this view from the other side  of the desk (hiring), they let you in on what works and  what commonly practiced job search techniques are a waste of your  time.<br />The book is thorough in covering numerous aspects of the job search  process. Some topics covered include, but are not limited to:  The New Job  Market, Motivating Yourself in the Search Process, Researching  Industries/Companies, Telephone Skills, Resumes and Cover Letters, Getting  in Front of Decesion Makers, Getting Hired, etc.<br />Sadly, this book is  vastly underpublized.	2000-04-11

To be fair, there are a couple of interesting tidbits of information in this book, but overall, there is very little to be learned.<br />The authors go on at length using their ad firm's (KB&amp;P) previous successful  campains as learning examples, or case studies, but there is nothing  revealing or earth-shattering in their message.<br />Save your money, and  instead, pick up books written by Al Ries &amp; Jack Trout, Paco Underhill,  Jay Conrad Levinson, or David Ogilvy.	1999-07-09

Did I say book? Maybe doorstop would be a better description.<br />Having grown up, and traveled extensively through the areas that the  author describes with such deft fictitousness, I question whether he ever  actually has been to the places he relates.<br />I grew up in the Mid-West and  moved out to the West Coast (Portland/San Diego) in my late teens, but the  lifestyles the author describes of Iowa in particular are so bent out of  proportion, and contrived, that this is one book that should definitely be  left in the outhouse.	1999-05-13

This is the noteworthy story about Anita Roddick and her founding, and leadership role at The Body Shop.  More than any single point, she stresses the importance of PASSION (in what you do) with religious zeal.<br /> You'll enjoy reading about the life of this fascinating entrepreneur, and the loyal and dedicated people that helped elevate The Body Shop into the international success that it is today.<br />  This is not a conventional business book.  Just thumbing through, you'll notice page-after-page of illustrations, photographs and an inspiring and unique way of looking at the world--both in a business sense and a humanitarian sense.  I was so inspired after reading this story, that I felt compelled to visit The Body Shop nearest my home.<br />  Anita Roddick isn't afraid to tell you how she feels.  I wish I could've been there when she delivered her speech to an audience of advertising executives and their clients on, &quot;Why I would never use an advertising agency.&quot;<br />  Funniest Line in the Book:  &quot;I'll never hire anybody from Harvard Business School.&quot;  You've got to read the book to appreciate it.<br />  She wants her stores to be clean, exciting, and the people who work there to be passionate about their work.  This book should be recommended reading for WAL-MART executives, and there employees.<br /> Actually, it's a good book for anyone interested in business, the environment or serving as a didactic for what women can achieve in this world.  I plan on encouraging my daughter to read it when she grows up.  Good work Anita!	1997-11-09
