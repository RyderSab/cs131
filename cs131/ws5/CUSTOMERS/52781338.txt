I had already photographed the wild flowers of Arches, Canyonlands and Colorado for my website. Now I could identify them. The book organises the flowers by colour which is good for an amateur like me. Now, I have to admit that I could not identify all the species I photographed, but I was pleased when I could. A big thank you to Damian Fagan for this book, I thought I might be a little bit too excentric hunting for new wild flowers in Canyondlands and Arches National Parks, even worse photographing wild flowers during my lunch hour while working in Colorado.	2005-07-31

It is true that the pictures on this CD are over saturated and have high contrast, this is partly because the photographer likes sunrise and sunset pictures. Most of my digital pictures are taken in full sunlight and there is a remarkable difference between our shots. However, there are many shots that I have not seen and it has encouraged me to visit the more obscure sites on my next visit. Some of the sites I will never see because too much hiking is required. This CD compliments the book, the pictures in the book are in black and white. Many of the pictures are superb. The CD also contains the excellent ThumbsPlus software which I have been using for 8 years and is a must for any photographer to sort out and edit digital archives. All my website pages were also generated using this software. All in all this CD has many good shots and will give the 'Southwest'photo enthusiast new ideas about this area, especially off the tourist track. In my opinion the wave photos from the Paria region were worth the price of the CD, as I had never seen them before. If you have the book it is worth getting the CD, if you have been here as a tourist it will show you some of the shots you missed.	2005-07-31

He compares the views of different commentators (useful because he cites Beale and Aune). He deals with most options on difficult passages before coming to his own conclusion.

Uses his own translation of the Greek, which is better than the NIV. He is very useful on the Greek and Greek text is transliterated. Footnotes are kept to a minimum and textual variants are left to the end of each section. There is a good bibliography and four indexes. The introduction is short (49 p) but adequate for the student. Comments on a paragraph at a time, individual verses are not indicated, which is a pity. He is a little weak on numerology and sometimes fails to see or mention contrasts such as the new Jerusalem the Bride and Babylon the whore.<br /><br />Overall however, a very useful commentary, which I highly recommend for students, teachers and preachers.

He has the advantage of having taught Revelation over many years in seminary, college, and church; the result is a mature reflective commentary. The commentary is not over technical, or large, there are useful footnotes as required and he comments on a passage rather than verse by verse. His writing style is a bit like D M Lloyd Jones so he is not a quick skim. It is meant to be read as a book and not dipped into. The text of Revelation is in italics and appears in small sections or individual words as he discusses a passage. The commentary could do with more detail, but as he says \\"writing a book, like making fine sculpture, is about knowing what to leave out\\" and this is a commentary that needs to be savored not gulped. The commentary would be useful to the pastor having the time to study and digest the passages, especially for those who have not preached beyond Rev 3. At the time Revelation was written the greatest danger to the church was complacency just as it is today.<br /><br />I found his transformation of the seven trumpets to the two witnesses to be interesting; the first being unsuccessful while the second successful in achieving repentance among some of the earth's inhabitants.<br /><br />Worth getting for the pastor and the scholar, but not my first choice for the student, try Osborne, Mounce, Krodel or Ladd.	2000-12-02

The first edition came out 1966 and the second in 1984, the year he died. G B Caird is a well-respected NT scholar and was Dean Ireland's professor of exegesis of Holy Scripture, Oxford. At the time he wrote the first edition he thought he was swimming against the tide, but in fact he is pretty main stream. He was influenced by A M Farrer, but that is no bad thing. While scholarly, it is very readable, not much Greek and very few footnotes. He did his own translation from Greek to English, my only quibble is that he uses 'lamps' instead of 'lampstands' in 1:20, this difference is important because Jesus is the lamp (21:23). He tends to deal with a section at a time but verses are indicated and key words are in bold. It is not exhaustive or over-detailed and occasionally he has little to say, but when he has something to say he is worthwhile listening to. For the student this would not be my first choice (try Osborne and Mounce), but if you already have a good working knowledge of Revelation you will enjoy Caird's thoughtful commentary, get it while it is still in print.<br /><br />Note: Among 7 recent (1997-2005) scholarly commentaries on Revelation Caird is the fifth most cited author.

He does, as you would expect, do justice to the letters to the seven churches, especially Smyrna where he relates the martyrdom of Polycarp. His mention of the Greek is useful.<br /><br />His dispensational and pre-tribulation bias appears in his comments about Philadelphia (3:10). When discussing Rev 4:1 he falls into the familiar trap of saying that the church is nowhere mentioned in chaps 4-19 (p 145) and things go downhill from there. We get the usual litany of dispensational interpretations of Revelation; the 144,000 are a select group of Jewish believer (p 219); 11:1-2 refers to a rebuilt Jewish temple and a restored sacrificial system (p 294); the two witnesses are Moses and Elijah (p 300). The literal approach focuses on the Jews (Israel) rather than the church, which is its fatal flaw.<br /><br />One wonders why MacArthur writes a commentary on Revelation in the first place if the church is nowhere to be seen after chap 3. I have to ask how the 144,000 get converted if there is no one to evangelize them. While I agree that the word 'church' does not occur in chap 4-19 what about the word 'saints' which occurs 12 times, not to mention 'servants' 6 times and 'prophets' 6 times.<br /><br />The more mainstream commentaries clearly do find the church after chap 3. Revelation has been a source of comfort to persecuted believers ever since it was written; shortly after which the church went through over two hundred years of persecution until the time of Constantine. I would rather not recommend MacArthur's commentary on Revelation; you would get a more balanced and relevant approach from the likes of Mounce, Krodel, Ladd, Johnson and Newport (who is useful because he came out from the dispensational system).	2000-10-02

The plot is simple, by Rev 4:2 the church has been raptured and those left behind go through the tribulation. Thus Revelation chapters 4 -19 are made totally irrelevant to the church who will be in heaven. LaHaye's interpretation is a distinctly dispensational view and is at odds with the other modern mainstream commentaries on Revelation. His commentary is also one of the few that indulges in Catholic bashing.<br />His interpretation relies on a very shaky interpretation of the letter to the church in Philadelphia especially in Rev 3:10 (p 81). And an even more shaky interpretation of Rev 4:1-2 in which John is summoned in the spirit to heaven (p 99). John is in heaven in the spirit, it is not a bodily rapture because his body remained firmly in Patmos and we cannot therefore take this event to symbolise the bodily rapture of the church. LaHaye notes that the absence of the word 'church' in the rest of Revelation indicates that it is not on earth during the tribulation (p 100). This is a poor argument because 'Israel' is not mentioned after Rev 7:4 until Rev 21:12, are we to assume that Israel is raptured after Rev 7:4? While the word 'church' is not found after Rev 3:22 until Rev 22:16 we do find 'saints' mentioned 12 times after Rev 3:22, 'servants' 11 times, 'prophets' eight times and 'brothers' four times. Not all of these references are to those on the earth but some are, see Rev 13:7 and 10 for example. He also states that the extensive use of OT language in Ch 4-18 indicates Israel not the church, however the whole of Revelation from Ch 1 - 22 has allusions to the OT.<br />He holds that the seven churches represent the seven ages of church history, which was popular when I was a young Christian at college. However the problem is that the seventh and last church (Laodicea see Rev 3:14) is the lukewarm church that Christ is about to spew out of his mouth. Now we all like to think that we live in the last days, but according to the church age view we are lukewarm. This is no problem to LaHaye, he says that the first three church ages are consecutive but the last four are parallel, all ending with the rapture (Philadelphia) or tribulation, the Laodiceans get left behind (p 24 and 84).<br />He claims that this book represents the theology used for the 'Left Behind' fiction series, but he gets his theology wrong. By all means buy his &quot;Left Behind&quot; books and 'Revelation Unveiled' and enjoy them as fiction. Don't just take my word for it, read a few other commentaries on Revelation and judge for yourself. For a more balanced interpretation of Revelation get Hendriksen, for the layman try Ladd, students try Krodel and for the young Christian try Barton (all available from Amazon).Now we all like to think that we live in the last days, but according to the church age view we are lukewarm.

It is scholarly without being over academic and it is readable. He has the knack of getting to the spiritual meaning of the passage, which makes it especially valuable for pastors wanting to feed their flock. He rightly highlights the twin themes of worship and idolatry, rather than emphasising persecution thus making it more useful to the church in the West. He served as a pastor for four years and I have a strong suspicion that he still regularly preaches; the preacher could easily preach whole paragraphs from this volume.<br />The introduction is excellent for its history of the misinterpretation of Revelation. It has no footnotes, the Greek is kept to a minimum necessary to bring out the meaning of the text but it is sufficiently detailed to keep the preacher and student happy. The scholar may find that the lack of references to sources and a lack of an index frustrating. I might quibble with the author calling the four living creatures &quot;God's pets&quot;, but this is a typical preachers prerogative. I certainly think that the publishers should have made the book from a larger paper size.<br />However this is still one of the best commentaries available on Revelation today, especially for the preacher. Preachers looking for further application may find Keener useful, which does emphasise current day persecution.	2000-09-24

This commentary is aimed for the young Christian and the group study leader. It is well designed and easy to navigate. It is also reasonably  detailed and readable. Generally it gives the various alternative  interpretations for difficult texts, including the rapture and millennium.  The text of Revelation is in bold, and the comments are on one or two  verses at a time, with the fragment of text being commented on highlighted  in italics. It alternates between different modern bible versions, which I  found annoying. It does a reasonable job of interpreting the meaning of the  symbols. It includes additional tables and maps, an index, application  notes and classic quotes from noted Christian thinkers.<br /><br />There are  instances of sloppy interpretation or editing, such as saying that the  church at Ephesus was filled with pride, which is not what the text says,  pride applies more to Laodicea. The mighty angel of 10:1 becomes an  archangel by 10:2. On page 173 it misquotes Tertullian by saying, \\"The  blood of the martyrs is seed\\" it should be \\"The blood of the  martyrs is the seed of the church\\" (or seedbed of the church). However  these are minor criticisms on what is basically a sound commentary.<br /><br />Its  strength is that it avoids the crass sensationalism and fiction of some  modern interpretations and in general it follows the interpretation given  by the more scholarly commentaries, which is to be welcomed. It is readable  and not over technical and will help make Revelation meaningful to the  young Christian. It is not so brief as to be useless but it packs quite a  lot of information in its 284 pages making it worth buying.<br /><br />The study  leader will find Keener useful for application and Johnson or Krodel useful  for further detail, with Mounce as a more scholarly reference.

The scholar has Beale and Aune, the student has got the less detailed but scholarly Mounce, and the  layman has the rightly popular Hendriksen. There are a lot of other good  commentaries out there, but it is hard to find one that stands out from the  crowd.<br />This one by Professor Craig S Keener fills a need in that it is  designed to apply the lessons of Revelation to contemporary life. Keener is  no academic lightweight, he has already written a 1061 page commentary on  Matthew, but he is no stodgy academic either, he is also actively involved  in contemporary church life.<br />In the commentary he covers short sections  of Revelation by first discussing the original meaning of the text, which  he does reasonably well. Although I think more care is needed to bring out  the meaning of the symbolism of Revelation. The layout could also be  improved to make clearer which verse he is talking about. After the section  on the original meaning there is a section which builds a bridge between  the world of the bible and the world of today. Finally there is a longer  section which applies the passage to contemporary western life. The pastor  or teacher who has to teach Revelation will find this commentary very  useful and it will help to answer the question. &quot;Well what has all  that Roman persecution got to do with us?&quot; Craig Keener knows the  Western church well enough to be suitably challenging in his application.  He will also help to enlarge the horizon of an inward looking church.  Because he applies Revelation to contemporary life a new edition will be  required five to ten years hence.<br />The 576 page commentary is sufficiently  detailed to answer the main questions posed by the text but it is not over  detailed. The busy pastor will still need to supply some more analysis. The  book has quite extensive footnotes, which can usually be ignored, and four  indexes. Pastors and teachers will benefit from this book as well as  students who want more than just an academic interest in Revelation.

He also introduces each passage he is about to discuss. The commentary is not really a starter for the student, his introduction is patchy, and the commentary is not full enough to be a main commentary for the student. However, he has clearly thought through Revelation and his comments are usually appropriate and frequently helpful. He writes from his own perspective and the commentaries he had available in 1979. He includes liturgical aspects of Revelation which can be helpful at times. His comments on the Greek are useful, for example, when the dragon `pursued' the woman in ch12, it can also mean `persecuted'.

He recognises that the purpose of Revelation is to  'comfort the militant Church in its struggle against the forces of evil'.  It is not a verse by verse commentary, he discusses one passage at a time,  which means that the book is readable.

This goes one better and is at least two volume. It is an abridgement of the excellent 12 volume Expositor's Bible Commentary. If you are not likely to buy the full set or even the CD then this 2 volume  series is a good buy. I was very impressed by the 100+ pages on the book of  Revelation. There are six pages devoted to Mat 24. It will represent a good  start to a layman's library although in later years you will want to buy individual commentaries. The Tyndale series of commentaries will make a good start.	2000-04-29

Typically I did not read it. Since then I have read it twice - both times it was a good read. It is a mans personal experience -  to me it shows the triumph of God's grace. If you are a Christian you will  find it a good read, if you are a Hindu searching you will find it hope  from the dead - but you will need to search just a little bit more.	2000-04-12

Not a light read but worth a serious study. First published in 1873 after his death in 1871, the introduction is by Charles Hodge.<br /><br />James B Ramsey (1814-71) This is the only book he had published, and that after his death. \\"Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.\\" \\"Blessed indeed,\\" says the Spirit, \\"that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them!\\" Rev 14:13.	1999-10-25

The author is a physicist and was a practising scientist, he is British and therefore he writes from a slightly different perspective to the books coming out of the USA. The most significant part of the book is the section  on the age of the earth where he looks at the young earth arguments and  demolishes them quite effectively. It is also significant that in the same  year (1985) another book written in the USA by the physicist Don Stoner  also debunked the young earth arguments. Hugh Ross in his 1994 book  Creation and Time exposed the same fallacies as well as demonstrating the  cosmological arguments for an old universe. All young earthers should read  Hayward's book. &quot;Claiming that the Bible teaches a young universe only  adds an unnecessary stumbling block to those who are sceptical about the  faith.&quot; - Matt Perman.	1999-04-01
US	52781338	REHLGONC9L9PJ	0805413243	594115326	The Lion and the Lamb	Books	4	14	15	N	N	One of the best laymans guides to Revelation available.	Extensive coverage of the methods of interpreting Revelation. The author started out as dispensational and gradually changed to historical-premil. Quotes other good authors on Revelation such as Mounce, Johnson as well as Hal Lindsey. Includes short essays on important topics. As one who has read the more academic commentaries on Revelation I recommend this for the layman. Excellent value for money.	1998-03-14
