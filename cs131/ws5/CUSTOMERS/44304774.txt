It is very interesting how Morton weaves history into some sort of a novel that's very easy to read.  Inspired by the death of his uncle in World War I, Morton writes about the history and the climax leading up to the very moment when the Crown Prince Francis Ferdinand and his wife Sophie were assassinated by a Serbian terrorist youth.<br />Morton explains the nasty relationship with the Hapsburg Empire (that includes Austria) and the lower Slavic nations and the growing animosity between them.  This is a great book for history buffs.  My only complaints are that there aren't any citations in the book and that the friendship between Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud don't seem to have anything to do with the story itself.	2004-05-26

It's a great book about a story of two friends, Nel and Sula who go their separate ways after Nel's wedding and reunite after 10 years.  I liked the book but I was a little disgusted on how Morrison likes to write about character's bodily functions in gory detail, which I deducted one star from the 5 star rating...hence the 4 star rating.

I was even more surprised after buying and reading &quot;The Enemy Within&quot; yesterday.  Mike Savage goes further than his previous bestseller, &quot;The Savage Nation&quot; and digs up more crap from the extreme liberal lefties (and goes into gory detail on how they are affecting America and American values).  Those who are giving one star ratings should take a good look around themselves and their country.  The reason for the 4 star rating is due to mild grammatical errors (if I could, I'd give this 4 and a half stars because the grammatical errors are very few and far between).

What he didn't tell me is that he was mentioned in the preface of the book (the author obviously used my professor's book for a reference).  Anyway, the book does a great job detailing the economic, political, and cultural situations in Scandinavia dating from 1500 to the present.

This just goes to show you that Dave is old, but he doesn't mind making fun of the fact that he's old.

Either certain learning institutions aren't doing their job or college students aren't paying attention in class.

My World War Two history professor required us to read this book for his class.  Needless to say, I was blown away with the gory details (no pun intended) of war.  Before reading this, I thought everyone who fought for the Nazis held Nazi ideology.  This book proved me wrong.  A non-Nazi soldier (Guy Sajer) is trust into the reality of war; disease, combat, and pathetic political ideology were among the many dangers of war and Sajer endured every one of them or otherwise, he wouldn't have written this book.  Wisked away from his family and his girlfriend Paula, Sajer begins his journey into manhood as a young teenager nearing his twenties being forced to fight a man's war.  <br />To me, this book is to World War two as Stephen Crane's \\"The Red Badge of Courage\\" is to the American Civil War.  The typical, uneducated lad of sixteen wanting to be patriotic and finding out how REALLY patriotic he is by enlisting in the army.  <br />I'm glad my professor required me to read this.  It really opened up my eyes to the horrors of warfare and made me realize how good I have it here at home with my family.	2002-12-01

The subject matter is often complicated but rather interesting to the uneducated mind.<br /> It is clear that Anderson's intent was to educate and enlighten those who are not familiar with the concept of nationalism or the very sub-themes connected with it (i.e. religion, patriotism), however, it appears that Anderson seems to be writing for the audience of college students with the purpose of using his book as text rather than creating the book for the average person, since he is a man of academics.<br /> Origins and the outcomes of nationalism are the two main, distinct themes of Imagined Communities.  Anderson explains that the United States is not the only one to be known for its nationalistic and patriotic nature.  Many people, not just in North America, but in Europe and Asia, have a profound sense of patriotism and love toward their country of origin.  Motivated by religion, patriotism, or loyalty, people from around the world either rise up against the government or crush those who oppose the status quo.<br /> Imagined Communities is a detailed sketch of the outcomes of extreme nationalism.  Cases of people being imprisoned or wiped out due to imperialistic mindsets and goals are described in explicit detail.  Anderson points out that America and Britain are not the only nations to practice the Manifest Destiny ideals.  Countries like China, Japan, and Russia are not immune to those ideals as they decide to push further and further into westward expansion.<br /> The subject matter of the book accurately defines its title, Imagined Communities.  Each country imagines itself to be perfect in ideals, government, society, and religion and the country`s inhabitants strive to meet those idealistic goals.  Some countries have lived up to their imagined standards and some have not done so.  The United States was successful in expanding westward and \\"converting\\" the Native Americans to Christianity.  Russia was successful in its monarchial form of government until the revolution of 1905 after the massacre known as Bloody Sunday.<br /> Anderson's sources appear outdated to those reading this text today, since his sources have been dated as far back as the mid-19th century (the first edition of Anderson`s book was published in 1983).  The oldest sources are the primary sources, consisting of letters and manuscripts written by the history-makers themselves.  Nonetheless, the sources are valid in accordance with the people who wrote them and their viewpoints on the occurrences.<br /> The viewpoints used to construct this text include writers, poets, social reformers, religious leaders, and anyone from any walk of life imaginable.  These viewpoints provide accurate and vital accounts of those involved with or the victims of extreme nationalism and imperialism.  Anderson's academic experience and knowledge contributes greatly to this novel along with his numerous sources.  He gives each case a realistic touch and tries not to let his personal opinions interfere with the hardcore evidence used to prove each case.<br /> The shortcomings of Imagined Communities are few and far between but they must not go unmentioned.  Although the intent of the text was to educate the unenlightened and uneducated reader about nationalism and its good and bad points, it appears to take on the shape of a college textbook, educating those who are studying the field of history, social sciences, or international studies.  It is quite complicated and hard to understand, even to the eye of a semi-educated college student.  As mentioned earlier, Anderson seems to try to not let his biased opinion interfere with the historical evidence, but it is definitely clear.  He appears to be preaching his biased opinion on everything from religion to patriotism instead of sticking to the facts.  The text's strength is that it drives the point home, the point that every country all over the earth we live on, strives to and imagines itself to be perfect and heavenly.  The title itself is very appropriately fitting for the text.<br /> Anderson's Imagined Communities is a mediocre work with good intentions.  Unfortunately, those good intentions fall short of their standard of enlightening the reader about nationalism due to the fact that Anderson's style reads like a textbook and it is very complicated, however, his point at the end of every chapter summarizes his thesis very briefly, which makes it easier for the reader to understand and comprehend Anderson's academic writing style.  The historical worth of the text is astounding.  Anderson's sources provide great insight into the minds of people from the past though his liberal bias appears to be preachy in almost every chapter of his book.  It's a great book, but it is more suited for the college student rather than the average, uneducated person.to be preaching his biased opinion on everything from religion to patriotism instead of sticking to the facts.

It's a quick read, something that can be easily read in two hours.  It's also fairly understandable.  Endo's depiction of each character on their journey to India is amazing.  Mitsuko, the self-abosorbed, divorced, cynical woman and her friend Otsu, a Catholic priest who is more pantheistic than he is Catholic, Numado, a meloncholy man who writes children's books and can talk to animals, Isobe, a widower trying to make sense of his life and his wife's death, Kiguchi <sp?>, a sickly war vet in which everything around him reminds him of combat, and the Sanjos, the yuppie, naive couple going to India on their honeymoon.<br />There is great significance in each of the characters.  Ostu being a Christ figure, the Sanjos representing the \\"Westernized\\" Japanese who are almost ignorant of the Indian culture and religion.  Although I cannot agree with some of the worldviews discussed in the novel, it's a great book and the most symbolistic book I have read in years.  <br />It is no accident that Ostu gave God the name of \\"Onion.\\"  An onion has several layers to it.  Ostu believed that the God of Christianity was also the God of Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, etc.  This is where I give this book 4 stars instead of 5.  The God of the Old and New Testaments cannot be the same as the ones of Buddhism, Hinduism, etc.	2002-09-14

I bought it with a giftcard I got for my birthday.  I read through it when I was at a point in my life when I had doubts about God.  In a way, God led me to read this book and it helped to open my mind and my heart about God and His love for me.  I truly recommend this book.	2001-10-28

I can't believe it's been that long.  Although I'm nowhere near 50 years of age, I enjoy the Peanuts comic strip and I've read it for as long as I can remember.  This is a wonderful book to read to kids or to yourself.  It's a great compilation of Charles Schulz's creative genius.  It may be...but it's worth the cost.	2001-10-28
