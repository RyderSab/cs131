The pictures are lovely and the recipes are unique.  A couple things: Several of the recipes require an icecream machine.  The book says you can make them without it but that doesn't work so well.  Also, this book was publish in England so I didn't have access to some of the ingredients here in the States.  Gooseberries anyone?	2001-01-13

This book also gives good basic info for the novice who has never made pizza from scratch.  There is a diverse range of pizzas to try in this book but some of them are a bit to ornate or experimental for me.  Caviar or dessert pizza sound gross to me but I'll make the basic tomato pizza over and over.	2000-12-12

This is an elegant book with lots of lovely photos that captures the essence of authentic Mexican cusine.  It's the total oposite of the stereotype of Chevy's burritos an whatnot that so many people associate with Mexican food.  This book shows that Mexican food can be as involved as French food with many steps and ingredients.  This isn't something I often have time for but when I do, it's worth it.	2000-12-05

The down side is that I haven't made many of the recipes because I don't have an icecream maker or the time to make these intricate desserts.  However, if I wanted to impress people with a gorgeous frozen or chilled dessert, this is the first place I'd turn.	2000-12-05

The problem I find is that some of the stories are to experimental and poetic.  I'd rather not read about the AIDS crisis or world poverty within the context of erotica, which I consider to be an escape from the harsh aspects of life.  But that's just my personal preferance.  I know others feel differently.	2000-12-05

I has step-by-step tecniques illustrated with photographs, which is great for a beginer cook like me.  For example, they show how to make fresh tortellini stuffed with pumpkin.  I personaly wish the book had more pasta an vegetable recipes and less meat and seafood ones but that is just a personal preferance.  The dessesrts look pretty and unique.	2000-12-05

As with most books combining different stories, not every one did it for me, but most of them did.  My favorite was about two men who sit next to each other on a plane and have to whisper to each other and be very discreet.	2000-12-02

Actually, the book did make me the greed of American Society in a new light but some parts of the book just struck me as pointless.  Or maybe they just went over my head.  I was a little kid during the 80's.  Maybe if I'd been older during this era or had experienced the transition from the 60's/70's to the 80's, this book would have had a greter impact on me.	2000-12-02

Until I discovered authors like Ralph Nader and Paula Begoun I only read about beauty product in fashion magazines.  It is fascinating to look at this subject from a consumer-advocate's perspective.  This is a well-written, down to Earth book that is not afraid to tell the truth.	2000-12-02

All of the stories are really well written but not pretentious or rambling. I liked the fact that many of the stories involved everyday situations like an 18-year old taking his driving test. The authors were able to take otherwise mundane scenarios and make them very sexual. Reading this book was pure pleasure.	2000-12-02

Most Japanese recipes include some sort of fish product so this book was a good find.  The recipes concentrate mainly on low-fat dishes where I would have like to see a combonation of low and moderate fat recipes.  I also would have like to see more info on vegetarian versions of sushi, tempura , you know, Japanese fast food.  But still, a good book--probably one of the few of its kind.	2000-12-02
