US	52255875	R3PNEDB7ZAU5UM	0439784549	162568542	Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Book 6)	Books	3	13	20	N	N	Three stars well-earned	I'm glad to see a few other reviews have broken the you-must-only-say-fantastic-things-about-this-book curse. HPHBP (like most of the rest in the series) is good kids' literature. Very descriptive, believable characters, an interesting premise. But the cult of HP has kind of cloaked the fact that they are not *great* books. There is a lot of repetition throughout the series, which is fine; kids like repetition, and most young lit (even fairy tales) repeat certain narrative patterns. But everyone at the beginning of every HP book seems to have amnesia--no long-term memory of who turned out to be right/wrong, trustworthy/not, no lessons learned, no growth undergone. And that's what children's/adolescent lit is supposed to be about: growth and change. All three young protagonists seem virtually identical to the characters they were 6 years ago. If anything, they seem to be getting less mature. I know this can happen in real life, but I'm particularly surprised and disappointed by Hermione--I would have expected more from her. It's also been clear from Book 1 that Hermione and Ron are moving toward some sort of relationship, though it becomes less clear with each book just *why* these two would be interested in one another. A good title for the 7th book would be, \\"Harry Potter and the Endless Exposition.\\" Rowling always takes FOREVER to wrap it up, with  villains laying out every last detail of their diabolical plan and heroes explaining what just happened for 700 pages and why for the hero's/reader's benefit. This may have worked for Holmes and Watson, but a skilled 21st century writer should really be able to come up with something better. (I was glad to see Harry is a bit tired of it too.) <br /> <br />It's still a good read--makes a few deviations from the (frankly boring and predictable) pattern of the last several Potter books. [SPOILER--skip if you haven't finished] One of the biggest flaws in this overall good book was the lack of any depiction of the relationship between Harry and Ginny. After all that buildup, not even one scene of them alone together, talking or being worried or happy or whatever. When he breaks it off, I feel like I'm supposed to feel some great sense of loss and irony, but all I felt was, \\"Oh, were you two ever together?\\"	2005-07-23

There's a very good 300-page story here, even though the \\"plot\\" isn't the traditional arc but rather a wander through the 18th century Beau Monde. Beautiful, vivid slice-of-life, however, gets old at 600+ pages, especially since there were no real twists or surprises at the end. The stuff you think will happen does in fact happen. Some characters exhibit mature self-awareness and control at times, and then abruptly change their minds and behavior for no apparent reason. Sure it happens in real life, but this is fiction--I need more consistency!    Also: I don't know if anyone else has mentioned this here, but it's clear that Donoghue is out to draw some parallels with the political and social climate of today, particularly in the U.S. (e.g. the \\"war on terror\\" and the attempted legislation to curtail the rights of gays and lesbians). This is a good idea that I would have liked to see developed in a less obvious and heavy-handed way. It's like she doesn't even attempt subtlety: phrases like \\"terrorism,\\" \\"homeland security\\" and (yes) \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" make the analogy extremely obvious and interefered with my ability to really lose myself in the period. I know it was during the Reign of Terror and all, but at times these really felt like anachronisms. (Did the 18th century even have the concept of \\"weapons of mass destruction?\\" Canons, maybe.) All in all, a good read, but maybe wouldn't have been published and read so widely if not for the previous success of Slammerkin.	2005-07-06

Check it out from the library: enjoy the scene where Mrs. Fairfax dangles a pregnant Jane Eyre out a high window (one-handed, from the sound of it) while narrating her diabolical deeds and future plans for at least two pages. Be amazed at the stupid errors (though the more I read the more convinced I became that they're not errors but the author simply ignoring what Bronte wrote): fer instance, Adele was not six months old when Rochester left Celine, as Bronte says; she was seven years old (mathematically impossible for any number of reasons), and apparently in the room while the two of them had kinky sex. Twins cannot have different fathers, and I'm pretty sure even people in the 19th century knew this. (I don't care if you've heard the urban legend about the black and white twins, it ain't true.) The red herrings abound, all of them bad, some jaw-droppingly hilarious. I can't describe them all. Read it, read it, you'll see.	2005-06-20

Her intelligence and energy do shine through, but she goes off on long, book-reportish tangents about nearly every title she comes across (and she works in a bookstore, remember), without even going into more depth than the back cover blurbs. There is no logical organization or progression of ideas, personalities or events; it's a lot like listening to random breakroom chatter. News flash; it's not so very uncommon for authors to work (or to have worked) in bookstores. This type of environment draws literary types. She acts like she's the sole human being ever to have attempted such a groundbreaking step. Get over yourself.	2005-06-13

And while I'm guilty of this, it's the other way around: I don't love this book because I'm an English teacher. I became an English teacher (in part) because I have always loved this book. I suspect there's been a school project somewhere requiring the class to write Amazon reviews of JE. If that's the case, hang in there, kids: it's a spooky, touching, dramatic story, well worth some of the less interesting bits (like the St. John subplot). Not all of you will like it, and yes, the language can be a bit difficult. (In case this shows up on the test, it's Victorian, not Old English--a difference of approximately 1000 years.) You don't have to love it or have it change your life. But it's a window into the literary tastes of the past (almost like 19th-C chick lit), which shaped and reflected pretty much all other ideology of the time. That's why it's important, and that's why a lot of people, even those who didn't have to read it (like me), continue to genuinely love it.<br /><br />My only problem is with the ending. It still bugs me that Jane can be so powerful and end up doing such a cop-out. I hate to think that Bronte was pandering to popular taste, but that's the only explanation I can think of.	2005-06-06

As a few others have indicated, there are some really moving pieces here about family and memory, as well as some good looks at the life of a writer in many arenas (at the keyboard, on tour, etc.). Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to have been enough of that stuff to fill a book, and so we get a lot of filler, including e-mails that are not that riveting and the essay she wrote about the library when she was 8 (no, I'm not kidding). There is a LOT of repetition; many of these pieces were written and published previously, and that's fine, but when you sit down to edit them into a collection that hangs together, you really need to go through and make sure that things like her father's and brother's deaths, moving to Switzerland, first boyfriend, etc. are not repeated 15 times.<br /><br />I still love this book for the good parts, but would have been just as happy checking it out from the library.	2005-05-11

What I'd heard was wrong. In addition to rambling on about himself and/or nothing, Armstrong offers only warmed-over advice from other published books on writing. That's right, he's done no original research with any primary sources whatsoever. He takes lots of advice from King's _On Writing_ (making sure also to tell us in detail about King's van accident and how the driver was found dead the following year...and what does this have to do with advice on how not to write a novel?) and plenty of mildly relevant personal experiences, such as joining the Crime Writers' Association (though he didn't have much time to devote to it because he'd just started a new romantic relationship, you see). The advice he offers isn't bad (with one exception), but you could easily cut out the middleman by buying this advice in its original packaging rather than Amrstrong's dull recycling.    The exception to the good advice is the repeatd mantra: Don't do it. Don't be a writer. Just don't do it, you'll regret it, and so on. This would have been clever once or twice, but he does it over and over and over again. Excuse me, but if I weren't serious about writing I probably wouldn't have bought your f*cking book, now, would I? As if a single book is going to talk me--or anybody else--out of it.     This is minor compared to the other flaws the book contains, but Armstrong and/or his editor have absolutely no idea how to punctuate. He sprinkles commas, liberally, throughout, to the point where, they make no sense and, slow down, or stop your comprehension. This leads as well to some truly leviathan sentences--I counted no fewer than 9 clauses in one of them. Sheesh.	2005-04-09

(That thing about Pellegrino claiming Lord interviewed Lightoller after Lightoller had died is particularly disturbing.) This book is a lot of fun to read, in spite of (and at times because of) the fact that it's totally all over the place; information is scattered randomly throughout and there's no apparently logical order to it. Yes, he does also go off on some tangets--some of which are interesting, and some of which are maudlin, overly personal and just embarrassing. The best parts are those where Pellegrino's voice does not dominate, but where we get to hear extensively from other, very well-informed people like Ballard, Lord and yes, even Jim Cameron.     Be warned, though: Pellegrino fabricates dialog for conversations that have never been supported with documentary evidence, and is a much better oceanographer than a historian.	2005-03-12

Nicholl has done an extraordinary job of gathering the available evidence to present a seemingly strong case for Marlowe's espionage work and murder. What he hasn't really done is write a gripping story about Christopher Marlowe. The Marlowe chapters are good, and there are several other chapters that aren't about Marlowe but are still good, though I wonder what they're doing in here. It's like he didn't have quite enough material for a book-length manuscript on Marlowe's murder, so he threw in lots of other (admittedly very interesting) stuff. For instance, there's a lot about the Babington conspiracy, which does give one a good insight into the intelligence world of the times, but oops, sorry, has nothing to do with Marlowe per se. Still, I'm glad Nicholl got it published as a book rather than a scholarly article (which is more what it reads like), since this way there's a much greater chance more people will find it and read it.	2005-03-06

If \\"Laura\\" says that's the way it was in the books, then that's the way it was, period, and they want to hear no more about it.  <br /> <br />LIW's personal letters and newspaper columns are...well, boring. RWL's prizewinning fiction, on the other hand, is remarkably similar to the descriptive style of the Little House books.  <br /> <br />Some have complained this book does LIW no favors. Well, no. (Nor does it go out of its way to bash her--Holtz silmply states cold, hard facts. Very cold and very hard.) The strange thing is, no sympathy or warmth for RWL really comes through, either. I disagree with the reviewer who said that RWL would be horrified at the publication of such private material: no professional author keeps a diary and copies of all her correspondence over an entire lifetime without an idea of a future biographer collecting and publishing them. She wrote enough biographies herself to know this! Of course she'd want them to be published and read. Would this be the book she'd want? Maybe not. But it's a thorough and factual account of a long and fascinating lifetime, even though there's no clear hero in it.	2005-02-25

Unfortunately it's being marketed as adult fiction, which it is not. It could also have been a great short story or even a novella, but doesn't hold up to being a full-length novel.    Before everyone throws stones accusing me of being a hard-hearted, glass-is-half-empty cynical misanthrope, let me list a few of the major problems with this book:    1) unrealistic and unfair depiction of Alcoholics Anonymous. Sponsors provide support and insight on the program. They do not insult you and the one thing you can count on them never, ever doing under any circumstances is giving you direct instructions. Yet Bonnie orders Arlene around like an angry mother. She also tells her to \\"make amends\\" when she's five days sober--this is actually Step Nine, and takes years (if ever) to arrive at. It's like she heard about how AA works once and took it on her own from there.    2) Why does the gay character dress like a woman? Homosexual and transvestite are two different things. More bizarrely, why does the gay character dress as a woman in order to date straight men who he then prays won't beat him up when they discover he's not a woman? Why would anyone do this? I don't know a single gay man, no matter how messed up, who's attracted to straight guys. Again, it's like Ryan knows a *little* bit about gay culture, and in trying to bend over backwards to be open-minded ends up buying into some of the grossest misconceptions about homosexuality.    3) The foreshadowing is really, really, heavyhanded. No spoilers in this review, but the book contains spoilers enough. I saw the end coming from a mile away.     4) People make huge, life-altering decisions in the space of days, get over the devastation of death and loss and abandonment, overcome years of ingrained conditioning and decide to risk everything based on one magical \\"little boy\\" (thirteen going on fourteen is not \\"little\\"). Trevor's age seems to shift around--sometimes he acts and sounds like he's eight, and sometimes like he's 40. The one age he never seems to fit is 13.    5) The better-developed characters are two-dimensional, the rest are one-dimensional. Despite the rotating p.o.v (which gets REALY annoying by the end), we never really get to feel for or with anyone--just hear them narrating their own actions.    6) Other silly holes in the plot, or things that are never really explained: what the heck is going on in that \\"climactic\\" scene in D.C.? Why is the reporter so incredibly dense and stupid? Would a reporter's ethics allow him to knowingly run a false story as \\"bait?\\" Why does Arlene work herself to death to make payments on a truck she hates and ultimately destroys, instead of just letting them repossess it? Or sell the dang thing? And we don't really get to see \\"The Movement\\" growing--we see it spread to about 5 people, and all of a sudden it's all over the whole country.  It's like Hyde had a grain of a good idea for each character and their motivation, but never developed it beyond draft stage.    I agree with the comments that said it was a great premise, weakly executed.	2005-02-13

I was expecting funny. What I got was one of the most dark, haunting, poking-into-uncomfortable-areas experiences with literature I have ever had. And I loved it.  <br /> <br />As other readers have noted, it turns the romanticized pro-slavery ideology of GWTW on its head. If you don't want that, okay--don't read it. But it's done in such a masterfully emotive way that reading it is painful, humiliating, mesmerizing and sweet/sad. It's an experience everyone should at least try. There is such a wealth of careful detail here, and every bit of it hangs together, i.e., is plausible based on the events depicted in GWTW. (I always did wonder why bad things seemed to happen to Melanie whenever the slaves were close by.) The one thing I'd say Randall forgot to address was Will Benteen and Suellen O'Hara's claim to Tara.	2005-02-07

Diamant's prose is powerful and mesmerizing, hooking the reader from the very first page. Dinah takes us to a place we care about, filled with people we care about (either good or bad), and recreates such vivid sensory input that it's a disappointment to put the book down and go back to the everyday world. <br /> <br />Diamant takes just the right number of risks, re-casting the familiar story and characters in such a way as to make you go \\"Aha!\\" but without veering off into the realm of wildly goofy or too modern. The second act isn't as good as the first, and the climax is more of an anticlimax, but it's more than worth the read. This is the standard that most modern Biblical fiction aspires to (the one that re-started the trend), and few measure up. As fiction, it's a highly readable, believable, entertaining, heartbreaking work.	2005-01-24

I'm sure she is a fine scholar and writer in her area. Writing about Tudor England, however, is not her strength. Aside from the glaring factual errors (which many reviewers have noted both in this book and others, most notably The Other Boleyn Girl), she just doesn't get the 16th century worldview across. There are anachronisms, both small (riding sidesaddle) and large (false assumptions about the range of literacy and religious practices of the time). These books would be fine reading for someone totally unfamiliar with the period (like the author herself), but for some reason she also seems bent on assassinating the reputations of every notable female political figure on Tudor England. Here Elizabeth is the shallow, histrionic puppet so many (male) 19th century historians dismissed her as (though what else could we expect from the horribly shrewish Anne Boleyn in Gregory's previous work?), and all the good ideas are really Cecil's. Come on! I think it's fitting that only the heroines' torsos are pictured on the covers, to indicate that Gregory's stories and characterizations are entire physical. Thy're more about the costumes and weak-romance-novel intrigue; we never truly get into anyone's mind.  <br /> <br />And yes, I know it's fiction. But why bother to write historical fiction if so much of the history is wrong? (Not \\"open to question\\"--just plain wrong.) Why not write about a fictional queen?	2005-01-22

It's as if she wants to make them into the people she thinks they should be. The great thing is that this biography reads like a novel in many places, with inner monolog and dialog fleshing out many scenes. On the other hand, it reads like a novel, not a scholarly work. It's gotten a bit dated since 1932, but it's still a pretty fun read. She has a refreshingly positive view of Constanze and even Salieri.	2005-01-21

If it hasn't hooked me by now, it's not going to. What a shame that such a marginalized, pushed-around, forgotten historical character as Maude has to have not only her crown but the telling of her story usurped by the male characters (one of them totally fictional, with a trite romance invented for him as well). The Ranulf-Annora subplot is a pale repeat of the one between Richard and Anne in Sunne in Splendoure, and while the rotating perspective worked pretty well in that book, here it's just plain confusing. Every page and a half the p.o.v. switches AGAIN, and we can never really get inside anyone's head. A waste of a thousand pages. <br /> <br />Normally I like accurancy in my historical fiction but I also believe in a little author's license for the sake of not confusing the reader (as she did in SIS). She could have named her characters a bit more distinctively! The tangle of Matilda-Maude-Maud (yes, without the e)-Annora-Amabel-Robert-Rainald-Ranulf gets kind of irritating after awhile.	2005-01-06

This book captivated me, even though I was expecting it to be the story of Wolfgang and Constanze's romance. (I think it suffers from mis-titling.) Instead it's more of a portrait of how he touched the lives of each of the Weber sisters, which was very absorbing. The physical and scenic descriptions are perfect, not too overwhelming, not too scant or showy; each of the characters is entirely believable. Ironically, the action seems to slack off only once Wolfi meets Stanzi. Since she's the one who actually marries Mozart (hope I didn't blow the ending), I had expected at least a bit more depth--the fact that it comes nearly 300 pages into the novel clued me in that it wasn't going to be just about them. But their courtship and marriage seems rather shallow and rushed; her confrontation with Mozart's father seems hurried, as though Cowell couldn't wait to get it out of the way. I see their deepening conversations and their small quarrels and jealousies; I see her determine to break up with him and then go back, determine to break up and then go back again. I see them going down the aisle together on their wedding day, smiling and crying. What I don't see is them falling in love, or getting to know one another. Every single one of the complex and intertangled subplots was more real, more engrossing and better developed than theirs. So it's a novel about Stanzi and her sisters, not Mozart; the title could have reflected this a bit more accurately.	2005-01-03

Instead I met a bunch of thoroughly unlikeable people, telling unbelievably selfish stories of their own sick behavior and glossing it over with a thin veneer of faith. This is Christianity at its absolute worst: preachy, judgmental, hypocritical, materialistic (the money and possessions these women demand are absolutely amazing), self-righteous and smug. People like this are responsible for the unfortunate holier-than-thou stereotype that plagues real Christians--those who walk the walk as well as talk the talk. One character (do real-life people count as characters?) goes to the local Newmann Center (Catholic group) and then gives us a few paragraphs about how misguided Catholicism is  and how it makes her so spiritually uncomfortable. \\"No wonder the world doesn't want to be Christian, it's too much work\\" [sic]. Exactly who is forcing her to be there? Not a single one of them seems to repent anything, or undergo any kind of spiritual/philosophical change whatsoever--indeed they appear proud of not having changed at all. Every one of them manages to say something nasty about others and brag about her own piety, cloaking it with the ever-handy \\"I know Christ tells us not to judge, but....\\". I believe these ladies need to read what Jesus says in Matthew 23:13: \\"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees--hypocrits!\\"    Even more nauseating are the end-of-chapter suggestions on how to spread the Gospel: \\"Invite a woman of a different color to your home this week.\\" \\"Invite a single mother to your home this week.\\" Thanks, it's a well-intended idea, but terribly clumsy and inconsiderate. If I'm invited to someone's house, I want to be invited because they like me and/or want to get to know me, not so they can check someone of my skin color/marital/religious status off their go-to-heaven list.    By the way, this isn't what broke it for me, but this is also probably the worst copyediting I have ever read in a published piece of work. Repetitions, misspellings, punctuation errors (including the dreaded \\"it's\\" for possessive), vague pronoun references and dangling modifiers abound. And for the record, I am an atheist who has enjoyed other spiritual/ inspirational literature, both fiction and nonfiction, many times in the past. But it's exactly people like this who make the whole religion-thing hard to swallow, for me.	2004-12-17

Last I checked, feminism was rooted in female solidarity and sisterhood. I challenge any reader to find a single female character in this book who does a single kind, generous or supportive thing to/for another woman, with no gain for herself. The female relationships are largely shallow or antagonistic, and the male-female relationships take up a far greater chunk of the plot and character development. Just like in the traditional versions.  <br /> <br />That doesn't mean it's not great. It's fantastically written. The range of characters Bradley brings to life is nearly unbelievable. I can open it literally anywhere and become absorbed in reading--seeing, hearing, smelling, feeling, tasting everything. Definitely Bradley's best work.

Excellent and very engaging until about 2/3 of the way through, when the long, inspirational sermons started to blur together. I can handle the heavyhanded symbolism of the bees, the Virgin, etc., but I kept waiting for the human relationships to have more conflict and really come to life. It's more like a very nice Disney cartoon (with an implausibly happy ending) than a realistic/literary novel.<br /><br />The worst part about this book is that it makes integration/overcoming racism/the entire civil rights and feminist movement look easy.	2004-11-14

But as she slowly comes to more self-awareness and maturity, the sentence structure seems to reflect this by becoming more complex, more subtle and ironic. I ended up being glad I finished it. Nice touch. <br /> <br />Mind you, I wouldn't have given her a penny (and I borrowed this book from a friend). Someone said this would be a great and hilarious book if it were fiction. Probably true, because the thought that this is a \\"real\\" inspiration for people makes me feel kind of itchy.	2004-11-13

In a book this thick, I expect to have some new insight or revelation about at least one of the characters. That doesn't happen; it could easily have been half the length.

Suffice it to say that much of its advice is straight out of the Fifties (including all the stuff about your dad getting his Heart Broken because his Little Girl is All Grown Up Now....barf). Also, one page says that invitations should never be addressed \\"and family,\\" and then about 100 pages later there's a sample invitation addressed to \\"so-and-so and family.\\" This is what happens when 3 people write a book.	2004-10-24

So I tried to think of a book that I loved, and this one popped to mind right away. Great characters, lots of interesting exposition that almost never gets tedious. (The stick, sock, can, etc. parts go on a bit too long, and sort of peter out near the end--that's the only reason it's not 5 stars.)

At first I was doubtful of this book, but it won me over. There are a few minor factual errors (such as who walked with Anne Boleyn to the scaffold) that don't matter very much, but which remind you that Lindsey is first and foremost a feminist rather than a historian.

But I kept reading, which has not been the case with many other novels that tell this well-told story. It's something different.    Just to clarify: many of the objections here are about language. This seems to lead people to think that we're demanding the \\"Hark, prithee, for I shall smite thee, varlet\\" type of stuff. No thanks. Modern language is one thing--if Anne Boleyn and her crew spoke like 21st century royalty/nobility, that'd be one thing. But we are subjected to descriptions like \\"cute Franky Weston\\" and \\"Hank Norris\\" and lots of other colloquialisms. A historical author's job is to balance what we think the time period should be with his/her closest approximation of how it really was. Whichever side you end up coming down on, it's got to be believable. This was just a plain stupid choice.	2004-10-24

Instead we get to hear about what everyone else thought of her, but no scholarly conjecture about Barton herself. Lest you think the author is a serious historian above comitting conjecture, his superstition is very clear whenever he talks about visions, prophecies, possessions and archangels as absolute fact. He also has quite a bone to pick about the English Reformation--he sounds as upset as though it happened last year. There's also a bit too much archictural description, what kind of dung the walls were made of, etc. Skim it.	2004-08-04

The melodrama piles up at a dizzying pace: child-beating and incest followed by killings, racial and ethnic tensions, promiscuity, a lesbian affair, drug abuse.<br />In attempting to play out the Pipers' saga against the backdrop of early 20th-century history, MacDonald has produced an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink narrative that lurches wildly between affecting insight and inexcusable sloppiness.<br />There are anachronisms (would someone really use the term &quot;foolish lardass&quot; in 1914?); cliches (&quot;March came in like a lion&quot;); and awkwardly telescoped transitions (&quot;The summer flies past. Materia cooks, James works, the little girls thrive&quot;).<br />There are also some lyrical descriptions and hilarious dialogue. And the book is almost redeemed by MacDonald's vividly imagined treatment of the Piper children's inner lives: their secrets and terrors, their religious fervor and yearning for redemption. These dreamlike passages, including visions of saints and satanic forces struggling for the children's souls, are harrowing.<br />Less convincing is the way in which these characters metamorphose as adults, the pious Mercedes becoming petty and controlling, bad-girl Frances turning from Magdelene into madonna figure, and the Lear-like father, James, being redeemed by suffering. The point, hardly original, is that humans, like the world they inhabit, are neither all good nor all bad. But MacDonald's characters are too incompletely realized for their hasty transformations to ring true.<br />Her book is a noble failure	2004-07-14

Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you. Star Trek-- First Frontier by Diane Carey and Dr James I Kirkland. Doctor Kirkland is credited as the dinosaur expert, since the story is set on prehistoric earth. I hesitate to guess what Ms Carey's field of expertise may be, since it certainly isn't writing clear, literate English prose. The book is littered with cherishable errors - at a rate of one or two biggies every four or five pages. Particular favourites include a resolute refusal to use the phrase &quot;He (or she) said&quot; if at all possible. So we have: <br />Kirk clipped, Chekov bolted. (While not moving from his seat), he malaised, Kirk distilled....., he resigned (While not going anywhere) Kirk impugned. <br />Chapter 23 starts with the entirely incomprehensible sentence: &quot;Head down into the storm they went, pressing barehanded to their chests an unshielded sense of peril.&quot; <br />There are so many pleasing subjects for speculation here. How does a group of humanoids have multiple chests but only one head? Do you sometimes need gloves to press unshielded senses of peril to your chest? Do senses of perils usually come shielded and they took the shield off, or did they put a shield on and then took it off afterwards? And if so, why?<br />But all these pale into insignificance before the panoply of riches which is Chapter 29.<br />We have a Klingon who &quot;gazed up at Kirk with roguish languor.&quot; <br />A dinosaur described as a &quot;shriven corpse on the floor.&quot; As I Catholic, I find it curiously reassuring to know that Confession was available to prehistoric reptiles. A human is endowed with a twenty-foot arm. (apparently only the one, though) and the best of the &quot;he said&quot; alternatives.<br />&quot;Pushing, Kirk under-girded, &quot;But........&quot; <br />And I haven't even mentioned the rest of the book : Kirk leering at the bridge screen, the seconds that went by like surgical time (faster? slower?) the chap who cloyed to his work, Kirk reeling with respect for someone, disinterest used for uninterest, Kirk's surfeiting nod, vilification used as a synonym for hatred, and disdained for despised, etc.	2004-07-14

Otherwise I would have chucked it aside. Ditto to what other reviewers have said about the bogged-down prose style, plus several other serious flaws, including but not limited to:<BR>characters that are developed at ponderous length and suddenly disappear, never to be heard from again; the incomprehensible pattern of events which the narrator chooses (giving us every random detail for about a 12-year period and then skipping over a whole lot of stuff that would have been nice to know); stomach-churning prissiness that attempts to pass as womanspeak (&quot;I then scolded my prettiest girl for lisping so&quot;), and a burning-of-the-plantation scene that is laughably stupid as well as flat-out physiologically impossible.

US	52255875	R88ZA88PZGRFR	0743227441	512398584	The Other Boleyn Girl	Books	3	3	3	N	N	OK	The Other Boleyn Girl takes a few too many liberties in placing Mary Boleyn at the center of every single thing that goes on. History states that she was dismissed from court in 1534 and did not return. It also takes the traditionally patriarchal view of AB as a social-climbing shrew, as if she hasn't been maligned enough. At 500+ pages, this book still skims over the surface of events and is very, very talky. Sometimes Gregory seems so determined to cram everything in, and has such a melodramatic flair, that it's hard to connect with the characters' feelings (there's a lot of \\"I did this,\\" \\"s/he said that.\\"). Also nauseating is the author interview in the back, in which Gregory disparages nearly every single other form of fiction writing. Tacky.    And by the way, the operative word in \\"historical fiction\\" is the former, not the latter. If Gregory's going to deviate from the known facts to the extent she has (i.e. everyone who complained that the error in Mary's age was nitpicking), then why bother to name them Mary and Anne Boleyn at all? Why not just tell a good, fictional story, rather than dressing it up as something it's not? From some of these reviews, you get the feeling some people wouldn't object if the author had made Anne Boleyn a gas station attendant in Des Moines, Iowa.	2004-07-01

So there you are. It's pretty good for a novelization. It has a bit more in it than the film does--the few conversations that 1969 censors snipped out are here for your mild titilation. Odd that such a long movie (146 minutes) should be such a short novelization (barely 160 pages). It's not terribly accurate, either in history or characterization, but that's hardly Fenton's fault.	2004-06-29

(Can you imagine how dull The Excorcist would have been if Blatty had written, &quot;And then the demon said terrible things and made Regan perform disgusting acts&quot;? Come on!) It's dull and slow and bloated, the descriptions go on and on, the dialogue is just silly, and I'm not impressed with the research this time: ripping off the same demon (BY NAME--Pazuzu) from The Exorcist is just plain cheating. As if there's only one evil spirit in ancient middle eastern religion.<br />It seems to me that the whole point of writing a novel about Mary/Jesus/the disciples would be to put some kind of spin on it, provide an interpretation that differs somewhat from the mainstream. Well, guess what: the gospels are more exciting, and at least there you have a fighting chance of telling the characters apart. Very few of them are consistent or interesting. First the Virgin Mary doesn't believe in Jesus's mission, and then around page 500 she's &quot;always known&quot; what his calling was... Mary Magdalene misses her daughter terribly, for about 5 pages, and then we hear very little of her emotional anguish after that. Et cetera. <br />It was fortunate for George's sales that this book came along not long after The DaVinci Code. Otherwise I think there would be even more of them left on the shelves. Read anything else by George, but not this one.	2004-05-17

I read the reviews here, interlibrary loaned it right away, and sat down expecting a hilarious, jaw-dropping bunch of howlers. Instead I feel like I've spent the afternoon with someone's snooty great-aunts. There are a few stories in here that live up to the hype, but the \\"Bridezilla\\" phenomenon (described by the author as what happens to otherwise normal women who suddenly find themselves the center of the party) doesn't seem to be what's going on here. It's no fun to read about people who seem to have etiquette/behavior issues on every other day of their lives (including a few physically abusive grooms, which I don't think is necessarily caused by being a groom), and especially when at least half the people contributing to this book appear to think that the only \\"proper\\" behavior for a bride is that of a blushing concubine with bound feet. Admonitions that a \\"gracious\\" bride \\"thinks of others before she thinks of herself\\" (yes, really) are straight from 1950. Oh, and bacherlorette parties are the height of bad taste (agreed) because the bride will one day be somebody's mommy (HUH?!?!?!) This book has madonna/whore complex written all over it, and the horror stories aren't particularly horrifying: (paraphrase) \\"I carefully selected and purchased a thoughtful gift, and did not receive a prompt thank-you note.\\" Sounds like Ann Landers's worst nightmare, but no one else's. <br />I think my favorite is the guest who bought and sent the couple (the presumed \\"Bridezilla and Groommonster\\") a book, found it months later in a used bookstore, and bought and sent it to them again. Makes you wonder who's got the real issues. The message: show any creativity, spark or gumption at all, step away from rigid 19th-century convention just once, and you are a Bridezilla. See you in Etiquette Hell.<br />I won't even mention the historical and grammatical violations this book commits. But the authors condemn the bride who wanted her wedding party to go intothe neighbor's yard and steal flowers for the cermony for \\"not caring about the style and quality of the flowers,\\" and, oh by the way, for \\"putting her guests' reputation on the line.\\" Would it have been better if she'd swiped 'em herself?!?!? The chapter on bridesmaids and shower hosts who deliberately sabotage the bridal shower and/or ignore the wishes of the bride is particularly sickening.	2003-03-27
