I will point out that I read hastily and it was my fault that I didn't read more of the reviews.  When I received the book I was suprised when I read in the first few pages that the book is on traditional characters.  However as I continued on the author makes a case for why it is better to learn traditional characters and he makes a very good case.  I started thumbing through the book, and the book shows the brush strokes for the traditional characters and then for the ones that have a simplified equivilant, the simplified character is given (although without the strokes).  So my plan was to attempt to learn them both at the same time.   <br /> <br />Now it has been almost two weeks since I've received the book and I've learned over 50 of the 1,062 \\"basic\\" characters.  What I've found is that it's easier to learn the traditional characters than the simplified ones.  A simple example is the character for book is composed of the characters for \\"brush\\" and \\"say\\".  This makes it easy to learn and remember.  Whereas the simplified character for book is totally different.  In other cases the simplified character just reduces some strokes, for example the word \\"ma\\" in traditional has four horizontal dots whereas in simplified they're replaced with a line.  So these are very easy to learn. <br /> <br />I like the book because its approach corresponds very well to how I like to learn.  I need to learn 1,062 characters, give them to me and I will learn them one at a time.  There are no exercises, no sentences, just characters.  Often he shows how two characters come together to give a new meaning.  For example \\"little\\" + \\"hand\\" = \\"pickpocket\\".  Examples like that are really interesting and help to learn how the 1,062 characters give thousands of words.   <br /> <br />The author's approach starts with basic elements and then builds on them.  For example, you learn the character for silk.  Why?  It's not a common word.  But the character is present in the character for \\"you\\", which is very common.  So he presents the characters in order of their frequency, but also he introduces them gently.  My teacher tried teaching me to write \\"wo\\" (\\"I\\") and I had a hard time.  With this book I remember it as \\"hand\\" + \\"lance\\" and it's much easier.  This is why I love this book. <br /> <br />Really I can't say enough good things about it.  He says if you can learn 6 new characters a day you can learn the material in a year.  I find 6/day difficult, as I'm also listening to the Pimsleur CDs (highly recommended) but I am making progress.  At 50/1062 I'm 5% of the way to understanding 80% of Chinese.  It seemed impossible at first but now I know I can do it, all with this book! <br /> <br />One final note: You will need something to help you learn to pronounce the words.  Wenlin is good, if not a tutor could help.	2005-05-14
US	51885166	R2EVAVQAJTNKJ0	0671790617	225878554	Chinese (Mandarin) I	Books	5	30	30	N	N	Anyone and I mean anyone can learn Mandarin with Pimsleur	With Pimsleur, it is so simple to learn a foreign language that anyone can do it.  I'm terrible at foreign languages yet even I can learn Mandarin.  I'm really impressed with how much I've learned.  And the best part is I've learned while using time that would normally be wasted.  What I mean is I learn while walking to the train station and while taking the train to work.  Or while waiting at an appointment, etc.  That's what I love about this program, since there is no reading or writing, you can do it while walking, driving, riding, etc. <br /> <br />Repetition is the mother of all skill, and this is the basis of Pimsleur.  But they are masters at making you think and formulate sentences.  You don't repeat what they say, you say and then listen to the native speaker and then you repeat again and then listen again.  It's just how a child would learn.  It's like having a tutor sitting next to you, correcting you.  The vocabularly is well planned to allow you to say a maximum of sentences.  And the number of sentences you say grows exponentially with every new word or phrase you learn.   <br /> <br />I could go on and on but I think the other reviews have it covered so I will say a few things I haven't seen in the other reviews.  I listen to most lessons twice, and I try to make it on two separate days so that it sinks in over night.  Some of the lessons were more difficult than others, a few I listened to five times. <br /> <br />One thing I will point out is that I think Mandarin is difficult enough that learning only from a CD is not enough.  The reason is that each of us have a set of sounds we've learned over the years.  When we hear new sounds, such as those of a foreign language, we fit them into our existing sounds (it's very hard to learn new sounds as adults).  It's possible to listen to the native speaker and then repeat using our own English sounds and not know that the sounds aren't correct.  For this reason, I think it's necessary to have a tutor to work on pronunciation.  As proof of my theory, I will use me and my wife.  I am American, fluent in French (with a strong American accent).  My wife is French, fluent in English (with a French accent).  We are both listening to the Pimsleur CDs yet when we say the same phrases in Chinese we say them differently!  We even pronounce \\"wo\\" differently.  Living in Paris, there are a lot of Mandarin speaking people here so I decided to test out a few phrases.  In the beginning, after only a few Pimsleur lessons, no one understood me.  I had to stay the words in english, then in mandarin before they'd understand me!  I think now that I'm on lesson 18 my pronunciation should be better.  My tutor says she understands me better but that I have an American accent.  Sometimes we spend 5 minutes on one word and I just don't get it.  But like I said, I am not good at foreing languages.  So if you're really good at foreign languages, maybe the Pimsleur CD will suffice.  If you're like me, I think you'll need access to a native speaker to help you with the pronunciation. <br /> <br />Finally, one other thing important is to learn pinyin and that's not tought in Pimsleur.  I find writing down the vocabularly in pinyin really helps.  It helps me to learn pinyin but also to pronounce correctly the words.  Somtimes it's not clear if it's a \\"d\\" or \\"t\\" etc. When I see the word in pinyin it's more clear.  I strongly recommend doing this. <br /> <br />Overall pimsleur is excellent.  I recommend the tutor for pronunciation and the pinyin exercise but I do not count that against Pimsleur because that is not Pimsleur's goal.  Pimsleur's goal is to get you speaking Mandarin with only an audio program.  And that it does exceptionally.  If you think it's too expensive, I think if you listen to each lesson twice then there are 30 hours of instruction.  The benefit of being able to do the lessons whenever you want, during time usually not very productive in my opinion justifies the purchase.  I learn more with one hour of Pimsleur than one hour with my tutor.	2005-05-14

On one hand it's small and very to the point, with lots of color photographs which explain things better than lots of words.  On the other I think there is not enough coverage of the knife techniques and too much coverage of the demonstrations.  For example there are no exercises for practicing the knife techniques, which is something I got out of another book \\"Learn to Paint With a Knife\\" that I found extremely helpful.  The hardest part of learning to paint with a knife for me was to put down paint over wet paint.  This book dedicates just a few sentances on the subject, which were not enough to help me at all.  More than half the book is demonstrations, like \\"this is how to paint a rock\\" \\"this is how to paint a cloud\\" etc.  I am sure it's good pratice to learn how to paint these but I feel it's a cookie-cutter approach and when the reader wants to paint something else, like a building or a still life for example  he will be lost.  Why do these books always use a mountain for the big demo at the end?  In the end it just seemed a little too much like Bob Ross for me.  Search google for the author and if you want to paint like him (he does very nice work, just not my style) then this book is for you.  If not, I still recommend this book for the color photos and because it's not expensive.	2005-03-05

The book's goal is quite ambitious.  Teaching you how to paint like each of the impressionist masters in less than 150 pages just isn't possible.  But the author does as good as a job as possible in this setting.  The book is evenly devided amongst the artists, so you can get a feel for the differences of each artists.  Instead of copying an entire painting, which would be much more challenging, she focuses on a small area of the painting.  This actually makes sense to explain the techniques.   <br /> <br />The shortcomings of this book in my opinion are that I felt the book was more about copying the impressionist paintings rather than learning their techniques.  In many cases the copies were pretty good but close examination showed completely different textures and it's obvious the technique was in fact quite different.  In other cases the copy wasn't very close to the original. <br /> <br />I've also read \\"Paint With the Impressionists\\" and the author took a different approach:  He painted original scenes in the styles of the various impressionists.  I think that one gives a little more insight to their technique. <br /> <br />I think a better title for this book would be \\"How to copy impressionist paintings\\".  Overall if you want to learn about the impressionists and need some guideance in copying their paintings, this is not a bad book.  However if you do some studying on your own, and have access to a museum to study some original paintings I think you can do equally well without this book.	2005-03-05

That's the most important thing to look for in a book.  I've purchased some books where some of the paintings are horribly reproduced.  This isn't the case with this book.  I am fortunate enough to live in Paris and I have went to the modern art museum to see the Matisse paintings in person and I am pretty satisified with the quality of the book. <br /> <br />However, the text of the book is disappointing.  I really got the impression that the author was just writing to fill in space.  I didn't really learn much about his technique or much about him in fact.  I quit reading the text half way through and just enjoyed the paintings. <br /> <br />If you are just looking for good reproductions, this is a good book.  If you want to learn more about Matisse and the artists of his time, I'd look at a few other books first, maybe you could do better.	2005-02-25

They actually take the time to explain what a fax machine is!  I'm sorry but anyone who does not know what a fax machine is does not have what it takes to be a manager, no matter how many books they read.  The content that is there is great, but it is highly repetitive.  Just when you think you understand how important it is to reward employees they bring it back towards the end of the book, several times.  Ok, we get the point!  I got bored reading this and started skimming it, just reading the bold phrases and/or the bullet points.  I didn't miss anything.  It's full of fluff.  If you want a book to pass the time or make you fall asleep, this is a good book.  But I just felt a little cheated.  They take an intuitively obvious point like how delegation is useful and beat it to death.  I also felt like I was watching a commercial for the authors' other books as they seem to mention them every few pages.   <br /> <br />Overall the subjects they covered were good.  I wish they would cut the fluff and cover more topics.  The book could easily be one half the size.  I guess it depends on the reader.  If you've never managed anyone before, even a 2 person team then this book may be for you.  But if you've led others before I think you'll find you already know most of what's in this book.  Skim it over at the bookstore and you'll see what I mean..	2005-01-24

The only thing he could propose me was a few sessions of relaxation (I won't call it hypnosis).  It helped me relax, but as soon as I left his office back into the stressful world I realized that it didn't really help me.  So I ordered this book.  My coworkers made fun of me but I don't care, they're all stressed out right now and I'm not.  One of my coworkers even told me that I'm not showing that I'm committed.  I guess people think you're really committed to your project when you stress out over all the things overwhich you have absolutely no control. <br /> <br />This book is great.  He covers all the major areas of stress management and gives plenty of concrete ideas for reducing stress.  The book is very practical, meaning you can practice it and improve your health.  I read it about 6 months ago and I think I'm going to go back and read it again.  If you're feeling stressed out I highly recommend this book. <br />	2004-11-07

If only she had put the word beginner in the title I would have known and chosen another book.  The book is very basic, and more than half of it consists of experiences of her friends.  She goes into too many details about them, and the quotes sound made-up.   <br /> <br />I'm a beginner to heart rate training but not a beginner to exercise.  I ended up with lots of questions that her book doesn't answer.  She says many things that I'm questioning.  Maybe they're true for beginners who are out of shape but for me?  According to her book, I'm running anaerobically (86% of HR max) yet I'm not even out of breath.  Later she says that the threshold is different for everyone.  so these percentages she gives (60%, 70%, 80%, etc.) are not accurate. <br /> <br />Overall I got some good ideas from this book, like the importance of cross-training and keeping a log of what I do.  But at the same time I think at least half of it wasn't helpful.  If you haven't exercises in a while and are out of shape, and are willing to buy a heart rate monitor (I suggest Polar) then this book is for you.  If you already exercise I would search for a more advanced book or website. <br /> <br />	2004-09-09

I read some of the reviews here and was shocked at how people criticize Bryson, especially saying he got scientific terms mixed up or had errors in his book.  He is not a scientist and in my opinion that makes this book that much more impressive!  Bryson devoted years of his life to learn this material, and to think we can take it all in by reading a book.. well it just doesn't seem fair!  I was sad when I reached the end of the book, I wanted it to continue.  I learned so much from this book, and it's interesting how many times the subject material in this book comes up in every day conversations.  <br />Bryson approaches history from two angles:  Astronomy and what we know about the universe, and Evolution and what we know about life on Earth.  I learned so many things I didn't know.  Fascinating facts such as that meteorites are used to date the earth with carbon dating (they're the same age).  Meteorites contain proteins needed to build life.  Human like species have been on Earth for 1 million years.  After finishing this book, I find myself thinking about topics like these during my free time.  That's how impressive this book is.  If you love science, this won't be a book you just read and forget.  It's a book that will teach you things you'll be thinking about for a long time.  <br />Honestly I cannot recommend this book highly enough.  If you're interested in science, it is a must read.<br />Michael	2004-07-17

I've read a few books on France before, and always learned from them.  This book is no exception.  What I liked about this book is it really studied the French from different angles.  For example, a lot of detail was given on their school system, government, and history (especially the wars).  I've been here 4 years and I learned so much about the French that I never knew before.  I feel like I have a much better understanding of the French.<br />While living here I constantly find myself comparing France to the US.  France does a lot of things right, such as universal healthcare, 7+ weeks of vacation per year (this year was higher than normal with 38 days).  But there is a cost:  Taxes are high, there is a 19.6% VAT tax.  Gas is 3 times the price in the US.  There are very little part time jobs.  Most jobs are in Paris and the housing is insanely expensive (a 100 year old 1 bedroom apartment costs as much as a brand new 1400 sq foot home in Arizona).  If you read this book you'll understand a little more of these tradeoffs.  I wish the book had focused more on this angle as I think this is one of the most interesting.  <br />I also highly recommend &quot;French: Friend or Foe&quot;.  it deals more with the social aspects of living in France.<br />-Michael	2004-07-05

I've read it front to back several times, and I've read through different chapters numerous times.  He uses a very limited palette:  cad yellow light, alizarin crimson, ultramarine, and phthalo green.  I've been using a limited palette since I read his book, although I often alter the colors a bit.  People say the palette is too limited but once you master it you can easily change the colors and add others as required.  I found they're seldom required.<br />He has a challenge to do 100 starts which is great.  I'm current doing this with a group of artists at WetCanvas (search Google).  He also has another challenge to paint a 6x8 plein air in one hour every day for 3 months.  I'm quite confident that after painting 100 starts and 90 paintings I'll be a much better plein air painter.  I also like his suggestion of using a black marker to make a b&amp;w sketch before painting.  This helps to see the light/shadow patterns.<br />Overall this book is great.  Although it's for oil, his technique will work for any opaque medium.  MacPherson also gives workshops and from what I've heard they're very good.  The material in the book is what he presents in the workshop!	2004-06-27

Sometimes Michael Moore goes a little too far with his conspiracy theories but it's definitely food for thought and I think the majority of the time he is dead on.	2004-06-16

Lots of his quotes are great.  Like this one:  &quot;Don't ask someone for a critique until you're unable to give one yourself.  Then you will be ready to receive it.&quot;  The main premise in the book is to have the art spirit.  That is, instead of just copying what you see, paint what you feel.  I think that is something very few painters do.  Have you ever looked at a well executed painting but it just didn't do anything for you?  This could be why.  Really I think this book is a must read for all artists, even non-painters.	2004-06-16

One thing I liked is Carlson gives guidelines which help to make realistic landscapes.  A teacher such as Hawthorne (highly recommend his book) would say to forget rules and just get the color right.  But I find that's not easy to do.  Carlson's guidelines, especially comparing values between foreground, trees, mountains, and sky are very helpful.

Sloan is a big advocate of drawing.  What a big difference from other teachers like Hawthorne who says not to worry about drawing and just concentrate on color.  It's good to hear both sides.

The book aims to be the total book on guitar but unfortunately it doesn't cover anything well.  For a beginner it's very weak.  It doesn't describe how to position the fingers very well, it devotes two pages to how to play chords, that's it!  It tries to cover things like improvising and recording but it just skims the surface.  I think a beginner would be much better off with a good beginner book, such as Guitar for Dummies.  Then if you need to record, improvise, etc. search out books specific on the topic you want.  These \\"all-in-one\\" books rarely work and this book is no exception.    PS: The fret diagrams are extremely confusing as another reader pointed out.  They use 8 lines and I constantly look and think I'm looking at the 6th string when in fact I'm looking at one of the extra lines.  The fact that the author did this tells me just how clueless he is!  Any beginner that proof'd this book would have caught this as it is so confusing!!	2003-12-03

I wish I had looked at it in the bookstore first because this book wasn't for me.  First let me say I agree with almost all the reviews here.  Whether you like this book or not will depend on what you want to do.  If you're like me, and only want to draw as a hobby, this book is NOT for you.  The book requires exercises that must be done every day.  It amounts to a couple years of drawing exercises, and that's if done every day.  Who has time for that?  After that, if you're still interested, I strongly suggest you take a look at the book in person.  The quality of the drawings in the book are pretty bad in my opinion.  They're scribbles.  If I drew like that after 2 years of daily exercises, I'd cut off my drawing hand.  Look closely at the cover, look at the picture on the left and right, that is what this book teaches.  The drawing in the middle is misleading in my opinion because there are very few drawings like that.  So now I've concluded that this book is for people who want to draw scribbles every day for 2 years.  A serious art student maybe, but the average person wanting to learn to draw I don't think so.<br />I strongly recommend &quot;Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain&quot; by Betty Edwards if you're a total beginner.  If you're not a beginner, my advice is to either continue practicing or find another book.  I really doubt this book is for you.	2003-10-12

First she explains basic materials, and doesn't go into all the advanced materials that aren't useful for beginners.  This is good because other books overwhelm the beginner with material they don't need.  Then she explains color theory in a way that was very easy to understand.  Many books skimp on this but her concise explanation and examples were great.  Finally the step-by-step examples are good.  There are more steps than in most books, which I really liked.  Unfortunately there are never enough steps though and beginners often get lost.  But to have all the steps would make the book 1,000 pages.  So I think the author did the best possible in a book this size.  I've compared this book with a few others and I really believe it is the best.	2003-09-22

So disappointed in fact that I am returning it to Amazon.  This will be the first time I've ever returned a book to Amazon.  The book does cover materials well, but where it falls short is everything else.  He goes straight from materials into painting techniques.  He skips color theory all together.  No mention of a simple palette for beginners, warm/cold colors, mixing secondary &amp; tertiary colors.  I can't imagine a book geared towards beginners that doesn't cover this.  This book is definitely not &quot;step-by-step&quot;, many styles have no steps whatsoever.  For example in Alla Prima he just shows several different paintings, and the reader has no idea how he did it.  Other styles just have a few steps.  None of the steps are adequate to attempt a similar painting.  As one other reviewer said, his paintings are a little on the blurry side.  <br />I picked up &quot;Oils (Step-by-Step Art School)&quot; by Patricia Seligman and it is simply wonderful.  It has less info on materials (most of which aren't useful for a beginner anyway) and more much emphasis on color theory and detailed step-by-step examples of various styles.  The color theory section is absolutely fantastic.<br />If you just want to read about materials and see a few paintings done in various styles, this Creevy's book is for you.  But if you want to learn how to actually do these different styles, look elsewhere.	2003-09-22

It could have been a 5 star book, but unfortunately it's not.  The biggest drawback for me is the &quot;step-by-step&quot; instructions are very vague.  If you're a beginner like me, you'll find them very difficult.  There are not enough photos of the step-by-step exercises, sometimes there will be one photo for 10 steps and it's hard to see exactly what happened.  The book is full of oil paintings, mostly from the author.  There's almost one on every page.  Why couldn't she leave out a few of her paintings and put in more pictures for her examples??  The book seemed just as much of an exposition of her work as a book on learning impressionist techniques.  Having more pictures of the exercises would have made them so much easier.  Her instructions are very vague, for example in between layers she doesn't say if you should let the painting dry or not.  I've discussed this with people who have used her book and some tell me let it dry and some tell me not to let it dry, so obviously it wasn't clear for them either.  Why couldn't she just be more precise?  Sometimes she'll say &quot;cool the violet with its complement&quot;, well what is the complement of voilet?  Sometimes she'll say &quot;I look at the white block and see a bit of pink.&quot;  Well I look at it and I see white!  I think this book would be OK for an advanced artist who's experienced with mixing colors and color theory, but for a beginner it's tough.  She does have videos that cover the material form the book, but unfortunately they cost $200.  Finally, be sure you like her paintings (search Google to find some).  Some of them I really like but the majority I don't particularly care for.  One in particular was a house with snow on it.  She painted it with the snow being yellow because it was in the sun.  Most of her paintings are very heavy on reds.  They just seem unbalanced to me.  Some of them are downright unrecognizable.  <br />Overall if you are an advanced painter and want to create paintings like hers, this book is a good place to start.  But it might not get you all the way there.  If you are a beginner, I suggest some other books first.	2003-09-18

It all depends on what you're looking for.  If you know how to draw, then Edwards book is definitely not for you.  If you think you don't know how to draw, then this is the perfect book.  It's fun, you can make rapid progress, and you can finish the book in a week or two (depending on how much time you have).  If you couldn't draw before starting the book, I gaurantee you will be impressed with your drawing afterwards!  <br />The book teaches you how to copy what you see.  So if you're drawing a person, a room, or a landscape, it works great.  If you want to draw cartoons, imagined scendes, or something from memory, I don't think this book will help you.  <br />Finally, people seem to not like her left brain / right brain stuff.  Whether you believe it or not, you can still benefit from the book.  Personally I believe it.  When I drew my chair, my left brain told me that the angle between one leg and the bar connecting the two back legs was 90 degrees, so I drew it 90 degrees even though from the angle I was looking from, the angle was clearly not 90 degrees.  So why did I draw something I didn't see?  That is the entire premise of the book, and is why most people &quot;can't draw&quot;.  I started over, yet I still find my left brain telling me how something is supposed to look.  But now I'm aware of it and I draw what I see.  The result is things that were difficult such as a winding staircase, the wrinkle in a shirt, etc. are all easy.<br />Overall I highly recommend this book for anyone who thinks they cannot draw.	2003-08-29

I was quite suprised to see many of the concepts and best practices McConnell presents in this book are very consistent with XP's practices.  I also like how McConnell gives lots of references for his claims.  He gives plenty of convincing data and supporting arguments to show what many of us already know yet many managers refuse to believe.  Things like mandatory overtime can make productivity go down, the importance of moral, why managers can't control all the variables of a SW project (cost, schedule, &amp; product).  Overall this book is a great read and I really believe if everyone followed this book's best practices, especially 40 hour work week and honest scheduling, the entire SW industry would be much better than it is today.	2003-08-19

It's easy to say that companies need business intelligence and throw around some very vague and general facts and examples.  And that's what this book does.  The case studies offer no details at all.  If you've never heard of e-business or intelligence (basically if you've been living in a cave) then this book will introduce the topic at a high level.  But if you're looking for more information you'd better look some place else.  I know the author is the founder of Business Objects, but I just expected more from this book and was very disappointed.	2003-08-19
US	51885166	R16CJAAAM22ADR	0201733978	995351584	Extreme Programming Explored	Books	3	5	7	N	N	A good 2nd XP book, but lacks advanced content	I'm a big fan of eXtreme Programming.  I've read XP Installed (the first XP book I read), XP Explained (the first XP book), and Planning XP.  I must say I was a big disappointed in this book.  Here's the problem:  This book doesn't explain XP in enough detail to be useful as a first XP book.  But at the same time it does try to explain XP concepts which are already known to anyone who's read one of the XP intro books (Installed or Explained), making it too basic for someone who's been using XP.  That leaves this book some where in the middle, with a little bit of introductory material and a little bit of advanced material.  I think it's a good second book on XP (read XP Installed first), but if you've been using XP (especially refactoring and test driven development) then this book isn't going to be very helpful for you.  <br />Also the book is pretty thin and quite expensive for the small amount of content it contains.  In my opinion you'd be better off buying Fowler's Refactoring book and downloading the JUnit docs, and reading Jeffries' XP Installed.	2003-08-19

I rank this book up with John Gray's Mars &amp; Venus book.  The concept is simple:  People express their love differently.  If you're not expressing your love for your spouse in the way they like, your efforts will not be as effective as they could be.  For example, if I buy my wife gifts all the time but to her love is expressed by spending lots of quality time together, then my gifts aren't going to make her happy.  By focussing my efforts on what makes her happy (quality time in my example), my effort will be much more effective.  Dr. Chapman states that people usually show love in the way they like to receive it.  While that's not necessarily the way your spouse likes to receive it.  Kind of like when we buy someone a gift we often buy something we like instead of what they like.  It's a very simple concept but learning it completely can lead to very powerful results.<br />I especially like how Dr. Chapman gives specific examples from his counseling experiences.  To me, specific examples are what really drives a point home.<br />Dr. Chapman does mention principles and teachings from the bible several times, but honestly I don't think that would turn anyone off if they're not a Christian.<br />Finally as someone else pointed out, it is funny how he mentions his own name every change he gets.  Funny yes.  Annoying just a little.  Effect, definitely.  You won't forget his name after reading this book!<br />Overall I highly recommend it, especially if both couples in a relationship can read it together.	2003-07-14

I absolutely love his music.  So when I heard about this book I had to get it.  It's obvious Yanni gives his music 110% and after reading this book I realize Yanni gives everything 110%.  The book is very interesting, starting with Yanni has a young boy and progressing through his rock band years, his relationship with Linda Evans, and his struggles putting on the Acropolis and Taj Mahal shows.  The book was never boring.  If you wonder how he got to where he is today this book is for you.  If you think Yanni is \\"gay\\" (literal or figurative) and just for women, you'll be pleasantly suprised.  If you think he got to be so successful because he was a born natural, you'll be suprised again.  So how did he do it?  You'll have to read the book to find out but basically it was tons of hard work and lots of passion.  And that's what I enjoyed the most about this book, it's very inspirational.  After reading it I really felt motivated to work harder at my goals and not to give up.  That's why I think this book would appeal to non-fans as well.  Everyone can make their dream come true.	2003-07-14

I'm a software developer who's always had a mind for business.  I've worked for a few start-ups and even started a few myself.  My wife has an MBA and I had been thinking of going to school for an MBA when I found this book.  My wife read parts of it and confirmed that it is the same material in an MBA program.  Now I won't claim this book will teach you everything you'll learn in an MBA school (obviously), but I will claim this is a great book for anyone considering an MBA as well as for anyone who has one and wants to brush up on the material.  The author presents the most important information tought in business schools, at a high level although full of real examples.  What I liked most was how he gave specific real life examples, sometimes true and sometimes ficticious.  For example, one that I remember off the top of my head, he explains how Quaker bought Snapple when it was popular but couldn't win the battle against Coke and Pepsi and ended up selling it at a huge loss.  There's tons of real life examples like that.  I like the style of the book, because he presents the material at a high level and if you want to go into detail you can pursue the subjects that interest you on your own.  I also like his touch of humor, which keeps the book interesting.  Overall I cannot recommend this book enough!	2003-06-26

It was lighthearted and extremely fun to read.  My favorite thing about it was the little stories it had.  Things I never knew, that really inspired me.  I liked reading about how famous songs were rejected over and over before getting signed and recorded.  If you're feeling rejection or dispair, this book will definitely pick you up.  It contains great information on writing lyrics.  If only it had some more info on the music part of songwriting.  The stories are funny and entertaining and the information is really good.

I grew up going to a Christian church every week but I haven't went to church regularly in over 10 years.  So I find myself doubting my religion.  I choose this book because I wanted to know if Jesus really existed.  What I really liked about this book is the author makes his sources clear, which are most often the bible itself (and he always gives the verses and often quotes it).  When he states the opinion of other bible scholars, or gives his own opinion, he clearly states that.  He doesn't try to mix his opinions in with the facts.  That gives him much more credibility.<br />The book describes the life of Jesus and tells what we know about him, and just as often what we don't know about him.  It points out many of the inaccuracies and inconsistencies of the gospels in the new testament.  I learned a lot about the bible from reading this book, and I was already pretty familiar with it from my childhood Sunday school sessions.  The author separates Jesus into two issues:  The physical man named Jesus, and the question of was he the Son of God.  The evidence for the existence of the physical Jesus is overwhelming.  And the evidence for whether or not he was the Son of God is for you to decide.  <br />Overall let me say that this book is not pro, nor anti-Christianity.  It seemed to be very unbiased.  That's probably what I liked the most.  If you are a Christian, you will be suprised to learn a lot of things that you didn't know about Jesus.  And if you're not a Christian, you will be suprised to learn that Jesus (the man) really did exist.<br />There are many books available on the bible and questioning Christianity, and many have lots of negative reviews.  I highly recommend this one as a great place to start.	2003-01-05

I've read several of the original XP books (Explained & Planning) and to me this is the one that best explains XP and how to implement it.  This book was a revolution for me, and I haven't looked at software development in the same way since I read it.  It's hard to convert a company (especially managers) to XP, even at a new company on a new project.  Managers typically want developers to agree to schedules based on business goals.  XP will show you how to do this, but XP won't let you do the impossible.  There are tradeoffs, functionality for time.  Less time equals less functionality.  Sometimes managers just don't understand this (they want it all and they want it now).  In that case, it's best to find a new job!  But if you are able to apply the XP method, you will love your work, your customer and manager will be happy, and software development will be a pleasant and enjoyable experience.<br />A final note, I've read this book twice and several sections probably over a dozen times.  It can be a little skimpy on details and examples in a few places.  I've recently glanced through the new XP books and they give examples and fill in details, but they're expensive and you'd have to spend hundreds of dollars to buy them all and get all the details!  Instead look to the web.  There's an XP newsgroup (search for it with Google).  This book won't take you 100% but it will get you close enough to make it the rest of the way.  And of course if you can afford to buy XP Explained and Planning XP I think they're worth it.	2002-12-06

I consider myself an intermediate at piano, I'm completely self-taught and never taken piano lessons.  I just got fake books and taught myself.  However this book fills in a huge whole (for me).  It gives patterns in different styles.  So after completing this book, when I read a fake book I'll have lots of patterns to chose from.  <br />As the others said, this isn't a book for beginners.  Someone with years of piano lessons can probably go right through it, whereas I spend 30 minutes just on a couple patterns.  If you're a novice and don't mind spending a lot of time praticing, you can greatly benefit from this book as well.<br />Finally, I purchased the MIDI files from Mark Harrison's website.  I strongly recommend these if you're not a really good piano player.  I mute each hand while playing the other while learning each hand.  It's very helpful.	2002-05-18

But as I read on I found myself believing in a world in which they exist.  That's why I liked the book, he made it believeable.  I was a little disappointed with the ending, but I think that's because I need to read the second book.	2002-01-02

I tried reading it three times, the first two I gave up.  Finally while on vacation I finished the book only to be disappointed.  The story was way too long and had entire chapters that contributed nothing to the plot.  I don't think I can bring myself to read the other two books, instead I'll watch the movies.	2002-01-02

But then as a master storyteller, he connects them in a way that keeps the suspense throughout the rest of the book.  I even see events that happen today and I think back to some of the concepts in this book and I wonder if it's possible.  This was my favorite Grisham book.	2002-01-02

I think I set a personal record for finishing a book so fast.  DeMille really does a good job of putting us on scene in icey cold Moscow with the KBG at our backs.  I really felt there with the characters.	2002-01-02

There were also several times I thought the characters actions were totally unbelieveable.  But it was an OK read.  I hope the second and third are better because I already bought them.	2002-01-02

This is the worst star wars book I've read!  The first person perspective is boring as it leaves out important events.  The main character is boring as well.  How can a guy go on for weeks knowing his wife has been kidnapped?  The plot was totally unrealistic, even for sci-fi.	2001-06-05

Plus I like more of a country history instead of just city history.  As an experienced traveler, I can say that overall this book is good.  It's hotel suggestions must have been good because they were all full.  The maps were very nice.  The restaurant suggestions were great.  Only a few complaints:  It didn't tell us that the castles are closed on Mondays (we found out when we saw the big CLOSED sign on the castle).  Also there is not much info on tipping.  The book said 5-10% yet EVERY restaurant added at least 20%.  I got the impression the book hadn't been really updated since the previous version.	2001-05-09

I'm an intermediate student with very weak comprehension skills (my grammar is OK).  I got tired of not understanding native french speakers so I thought I'd try these tapes.  Well at first I  didn't understand a word they said!  I was so depressed!  But after a while  I picked up another word here and there.  THEN I read the transcript (in  French &amp; English) to see what I missed.  I've listened to this tape  probably 15 times already and I'm STILL working on it.  For $10 this is an  incredible bargain.  I've improved so much.  See learning how a word sounds  in French isn't enough, you must learn how words sound TOGETHER!  And the  only way to do that is by listening to native speakers.	2000-02-22

It covered areas like Database connections and connection pooling, EJBs, etc. that normally you need  seperate books for each topic.  The examples are small (a good thing) and  clearly demonstrate the topics presented.  If you want to do javaserver  programming, this is the book!	2000-01-29

It also has a comprehensive section (half the book) on the  BUSINESS.  It's a quick, easy read and definitely worth the price.  But if  you want to get serious about songwriting, you'll also need a book with  more theory such as WRITING MUSIC FOR HIT SONGS.	2000-01-29

It has so many songs that I recognize, I can just flip through it and play new songs any time.  It's a great tool for practicing because you can always practice a new song.  I  choose this book because I wanted songs I knew well since I'm a beginner at  the piano.	2000-01-29

It basically teaches you the chords that you'll find in fake books.  It doesn't say much at all about the right hand melody.  If it had included more about which  fingers to use (to avoid bad habits) and more about playing melody, I'd  give it 5 stars.	2000-01-04

I knew how to play the saxophone, but I didn't know how to write music.  This book quickly moves through chords (I used &quot;How to Play Popular Piano in 10 Easy  Lessons&quot; by Norman Monath to learn the chords on piano) so it's not  for a beginner musician.  But if you have experience playing an instrument  (any instrument), and have access to a piano/keyboard, this book is for  you.  I'm almost finished with my first reading and I plan to go back and  read it again, this time doing the exercises.  I wish I had done them to  begin with but I was so intrigued by this book I just couldn't stop long  enough to do them!  If you want to write your own music (and it's not as  you may think), BUY THIS BOOK!	2000-01-04

Great book on ASP but it used VBScript almost in all the examples.  I'd prefer some more JScript examples, however I will admit VBScript has more features for server side scripting.  This book is great as a reference  because the examples are so good.	1999-08-15

You'll have to read some sections twice and study the code to understand it.  It's more of an academic book because most projects don't allow sufficient time to do a  proper design and implement design patterns (I wish they did).  If you want  to be a good OO Designer/Developer, this book is required.	1999-08-15

I just bought this book and have already used it extensively.  My coworker went out and bought it too.  The book has great examples and a very comprehensive reference in the back.

Zahn saved the best for last with his final book of the Thrawn trilogy.  This book was great, I read the last 180+ pages in one day because I was hooked!

I liked this second book more than the first, especially the Mara Jade character.  By the end I was hooked (for the third book) to see what becomes of Mara Jade.  Zahn seems to take his time telling stories, and if  it were shorter (and just a tad bit better) it'd be 5 stars.	1999-07-31

I thought George Lucas told a much bigger and better story in Episode IV - VI than Zahn did, and in the same amount of pages!  In other words, Zahn's book is good but it's pretty lengthy.  I think the story could have been  told in a shorter version.	1999-07-31

It was great!  The thing I liked the most was  overall the complete trilogy is very short (less pages than Zahn's Heir to  the Empire).  And I didn't feel cheated by the lack of pages, things  happened quickly and seldom got boring.	1999-07-16

He doesn't just give you all the details at once, but gives bits and pieces throughout the book.  The second 100 pages were pretty boring and I almost  didn't finish the book.  Then for the last half it got more and more  interesting as everything came together.  I would have rated it 4, but it  had a terrible ending.  In fact, I wish I hadn't even read the last  chapter.  It made absolutely no sense at all and just ruined my impression  of the book.  I don't know what Grisham was thinking but I was certainly  let down.	1999-06-15
