I found this completely useless as more species are covered in other regional field guides I have.<br />As for descriptions of protected areas, that was another disappointment! :-(<br />The book devotes a mere 20 (small) pages to listing these, writing no more than a few sentences of each one. There is no information on trails, facilities, likeliness of seeing certain species... in fact general travel guides to Samoa or the South Pacific offer more info!<br />Maps?<br />There isn't even a decent one of the entire Samoan archipelago (for a laugh, I have uploaded here a scanned image of the only one in the book), let alone of individual islands or nature reserves!!!<br /><br />Buying this book was a complete waste of money, and if it wasn't for the fact that I am in Europe and postage costs more than the book itself, I would send it back! :-(	2005-04-22

This is very much a story of colonial life - information on the life of the native people of Maluku is rather scarce.<br /><br />The second part describes life under the Japanese occupation - mostly as POW in camps on Ambon and in South Sulawesi. It is interesting for her rather objective description of the Japanese, who are shown to be humans after all.<br /><br />In the third part, van Diejen describes how she stays on after Indonesia becomes independent, becoming a social worker. With most of the Dutch (and her plantation) now gone, she is now working with Indonesians and spends much time visiting remote regions. This is the part which contains the most interesting descriptions of Maluku and its people.	2005-04-17

Well, I am a native speaker of Hungarian myself, so I was quite curious to see this book.<br />For the most part, I found it very good.<br />The main part of the book, the phrases are quite good and natural - it really shows that they had native speakers check it.<br />The phrases cover all sorts of issues from shopping to visiting a doctor or even dating and having sex!<br />The boxed texts on culture are also quite good and often amusing.<br />It has only 12 pages on grammar, but that's quite spot on.<br />It does include a box on present tense verb conjugation (taking vowel harmony into account!), and has even devoted a whole page to conjugating four common, but irregular verbs (come, go, eat, drink). Another box conjugates \\"to be\\" and yet another shows the suffixes for possessions. I guess it's quite OK for the space.<br />The 2000 word dictionary at the back is quite comprehensive.<br />A weaker point is the \\"phonetical transliteration\\" system used - Hungarian is written fully phonetically in its original form (thankfully also presented here), but the phonetical transliteration provided here for English-speakers may result in blank looks in many cases - you could always choose to ignore it.<br />The intro contains useful facts about the history and roots of the language, though the map showing where Hungarian is supposedly spoken might raise some eyebrows in neighbouring countries! ;-)<br />The layout is attractive, with color illustrations.<br />I even like the cover (different from what is shown on Amazon)- certainly better than a kitshy horseman or traditionally clad dancer could have been! ;-)<br />Overall: RECOMMENDED.<br />If you are planning to spend any time away from the major cities and tourist areas, you will find it VERY useful!	2005-04-03

This is one of the very best books ever written about West Papua!<br /><br />The author was the leader of a British-Indonesian zoologist expedition into the remote highlands of the Lorentz Nature Reseve. The entire team was kidnapped by OPM guerillas fighting for West Papuan independence, and held hostage for several months until being freed by the Indonesian army - minus the two Indonesian male members of the expedition who were executed by the OPM.<br /><br />This could easily have been turned into a shallow account of hardship and horror, but instead the author has used the experience to give us probably the most interesting and insightful account of West Papua ever. Rather than just concentrating on how the hostages themselves felt during their ordeal, he is painting a thorough picture of the background to the kidnapping, and excellent descriptions of the Papuans' psyche and motivations. His observations are sharp and balanced, and instead of pointing fingers at any party, he leaves us with an understanding of the tragic circumtances that lead to the kidnap, and the hopeless situation that continues in Papua to this day.<br /><br />We also get to \\"experience\\" the down-to-earth lifestyle that was a horrible ordeal to the hostages, but is in fact the everyday reality of life in the extremely isolated Papuan highlands.<br /><br />Having spent months in West Papua myself, I also found the book entirely free of factual errors, hype and exaggrations that abound in other travelogues of this \\"exotic\\" place.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone planning a longer trek through the mountains of Papua.<br /><br />Don't let it put you off visiting - there has been no similar incident ever since. Read it for its description of life in this singular, remote part of the World.<br /><br />Note that while it is marked out of print here, this book is more readily available on Amazon's UK site!	2005-02-09

It is a rare and fairly detailed account of life on Buru in the early 20th century. While the story itself concentrates on a typical tale of colonial life, the translator's plentiful, unbelievably extensive and well-researched footnotes contain a wealth of background information on the culture, history and ecology of the Moluccas!<br /><br />The second story describes, in what seems to me a nostalgically  idealizing manner, the life and work of a young Dutch officer in South Sulawesi. While I have my doubts about the truthfulness of the way Dutch colonial administration is described as being to the benefit of the locals here, the picture painted of the local Makassarese aristocracy, then losing its power and importance,  is fascinating. Again, a wealth of background info accompanies the text in the footnotes.<br /><br />This book is well worth reading by anyone interested in the history of Eastern Indonesia.	2005-01-12

It is THE single most famous literary work from Estonia, and finding that it is not available in English presently is outrageous!<br />You can get it in German and French on Amazon's German and French sites...<br />Should anyone be able to locate a 2nd hand copy in English, they will find a tale similarly fascinating to the Kalevala (which I recommend reading too), though the poetry is found by some to be slightly less beautiful. Remember though that the author of Kalevipoeg had less rich of a source of folk-poetry to construct this epos than was the case with the wealth of Karelian runo verses that formed the base of the Finnish epos.<br />On the other hand, Kalevipoeg has more historical relevance, with many places and events hinting at the real history of Estonia.<br />Highly recommended, and hopefully it will be published in English and made available to a wider readership once more.	2005-01-08

Very few described, very poorly.<br /><br />History & politics? These chapters look as if they had been contributed by the propaganda department of the Eritrean government, with glorifying accounts of the heroic fight for freedom and no mentioning of the disgraceful present.<br /><br />Flora & fauna? The author's knowledge seems to end at distinguishing a mammal from a bird - maybe.<br /><br />The bottom line is that until Bradt gets a new author to rewrite this guide completely, you are far better off reading the shorter but much better chapter on this wonderful country in Lonely Planet's Ethiopia & Eritrea guide than wasting your money, like I did, on ordering this book.<br /><br />The 2 stars were only given as an acknowledgement for the publisher's effort to put out a separate guide to this unusual destination, not for the actual value of this book which is closer to zero.	2004-10-23

Regrettably, Gaelic-speaking minorities of Britain and Ireland are omitted from the book.<br /><br />Though I was somewhat baffled by her often decidedly ad hoc approach to finding informants and the family's hippy or gypsy style travel (complete with unwashed clothes and lice), overall she has presented a fascinating look at Europe from a very unusual angle.<br />Reading about often tiny minorities struggling to preserve their identity, culture and language under rather different circumtances in the various European countries, one can't fail to be shocked by the ignorance or even hostility exhibited towards them by many of the supposedly democratic nation states they live in.<br />Rather than case studies presented in a dry, academic manner, the fate of each group and their language is depicted through personal impressions of them and their lands by a layman (well, woman) and personal accounts of various members of these \\"tribes\\". This manages to bring the issue to life, giving us a good feel of what the minorities themselves think about their own history, present situation and future prospects.<br />As the title suggests, one of the focal points of the author's investigation was the fate of the mother tongues of these minorities, and she presents an often sad, yet sometimes cautiously optimistic picture of past (sometimes even present) opression, lethargic neglect, and passionate efforts to turn back the process of assimilation and extinction.<br />While those preferring just to get the essential facts and statistical data are advised to look elsewhere, this book can be an absorbing read for those who wish to get to know the human faces of Europe's endangered minority native peoples and languages.<br /><br />Note that while it is marked out of print here, new copies of another edition (ISBN: 0330372815) of this book are still available cheaply on Amazon's UK site!e who wish to get to know the human faces of Europe's endangered minority native peoples and languages.

She successfully avoids generalizations by pointing out how different relationships were/are between natives and Slavic migrants in various regions.<br />There are also plenty of interesting references to the traditional Khanty belief system. Unfortunately the fact that both the author and her major informants are women seems to have limited the extent of insight she could gain in this field - among the Khanty (and the related Mansi) only men are allowed to see certain sacred sites and rituals.<br />While much of the book illustrates how successfully the Northern Khanty have managed to incorporate elements of outside cultures while preserving their own identity, the last chapter, which details worrying developments that have happened since the fall of communism, leaves one wondering quite how much longer this small group can hold out in the face of ever larger encroachment on their traditional homeland and way of life by the powerful petroleum industry in particular.	2004-10-17

He not only points out the fact that often communities themselves are to blame for not doing enough to pass on their native tongues to the following generation, but also examines what may have lead them to do so.<br /><br />One shortcoming of the book is that very few actual \\"real-life\\" cases are mentioned to illustrate his points and breathe life into the subject, and those few cases that are mentioned only get a few lines - this leaves the text somewhat dry and academic.<br /><br />He has also devoted one chapter to \\"Why should we care?\\", and as usual in books about this issue, that is where his writing is weakest. I found his arguments rather unconvincing, but also unnecessary - I personally don't feel the need to have practical arguments to care about preserving languages, which I think should be considered valuable in their own right.<br /><br />A valuable extra in the book is the appendix listing organizations devoted to the preservation of endangered languages worldwide.	2004-10-17

The little-known eastern Finno-Ugric peoples have so far seemed to receive scant attention in the West, and this is one of the few topics about which I found more books published in my native Hungarian (in a fellow Finno-Ugric country) than in English.<br />Most publications on the Finno-Ugric peoples tend to be linguistic or ethnographic descriptions, and for history one had to be content with short introductory chapters in these, or in general histories of Russia or Siberia (of which Forsyth's \\"A History of the Peoples of Siberia\\" stands out) where the treatment of the Finno-Ugrics is invariably limited.<br /><br />Taagepera's book now largely fills this gap!<br />It is detailed history of all but the smallest of these nations (including the Samoyeds) right up to the mid-1990-es.<br />After introductory chapters on the Finno-Ugric nations in the World context and on the independent Finno-Ugric countries of the EU, he describes the history of each eastern group in separate chapters (40-50 pages on each). While \\"traditional\\" culture is described briefly and the long history of contact with the Russians is dealt with in depth, the major focus is on the recent developments and prospects for the future.<br />Unlike some other books, this one doesn't see all these ethnic groups (and their languages) as doomed, though it does advocate that a greater extent of autonomy is required to help them survive as distinct nations.<br />The last chapter is devoted to examining chances of this being granted in today's Russia.

After seeing all the raving reviews of this book, I was excited to have a look myself.<br />Unfortunately, it turned out to be a major disappointment. Its coverage of Indonesia is largely focussed on Java, with very little attention paid to other islands. What is worse, I often found the style to be very much of populist journalism, aimed at uninformed readers, based on catchy phrases and anecdotes rather than hard facts. This is particularly evident when the author does deal with the outer islands, about which his knowledge seems to be, err, limited...<br />To give just 2 examples:<br />In the chapter on Aceh, the author makes a lot of fuss about how the Grand Mosque in Banda Aceh, with its very \\"un-Javanese\\", Indian style expresses the orientation of the Acehnese towards West, rather than towards Java and the rest of Indonesia. What a poor example! He obviously failed to realize that the beautiful mosque in question was actually built by the Dutch colonialists (designed by an Italian architect), after they had destroyed the original, typically \\"Javanese-looking\\" Acehnese mosque previously standing there during their bloody conquest of Aceh, and is therefore an example of the westward orientation of the Dutch, not of the Acehnese!<br />In the chapter on the conflict in Ambon and the rest of Maluku, he puts much of the blame on the breakdown of traditional values due to westernization, claming the coming of cell-phones and McDonalds (among others) paved the way to the bloody events there. Oh dear... anyone familiar with Ambon (I was there in 1999 when the troubles started) will know that neither cell-phones nor McDonalds had made it to that remote island back then, so while the real roots of that conflict will probably never be fully revealed, they were certainly something rather more serious - and political.<br />Information from Indonesian policy-makers themselves? Well, the description of the one meeting he had with president Megawati described in the book tells us pretty much nothing besides the fact that Megawati could actually speak English!<br />I admit that having read such silly stuff and finding the style so populist, I put the book down without reading the whole lot.<br />I really think there are far better books on the history of Indonesia by more serious authors available even on Amazon, notably those by Kingsbury, Ricklefs, Taylor, and Bertrand - to name just a few.ing besides the fact that Megawati could actually speak English!

But every single genus is represented, and of rodents, every species of squirrel is dealt with separately.<br />The information accompanying each species is very detailed and appears up to date.<br /><br />Now for the shortcomings:<br />1) The illustrations are next to the description of each species. Given how detailed/long the texts are, this means that usually there are just 1 or 2 species shown on each page, so to compare all antelopes you must look through a hundred pages or so - not very practical in a field guide!<br />2) Maps are often pages away from the text and illustration, with no reference to their whereabouts. I often thought there was no map for a species/genus, only to find it pages away, combined with the map for another taxon.<br />3) While illustrations are identified by the species' English name, the maps are confusingly id'ed by Latin names only. If you aren't familiar with the latter, it takes some cross-reference to find out which species' range you are looking at.<br />4) The illustrations vary so much in standard that it is hard to believe they were drawn by one person... While most are quite good, even excellent and life-like, others are quite awful, either showing animals with stiff, straight limbs/bodies as if drawn with a ruler (like the Crowned Monkey) or in highly unnatural positions (like the Potto with the limbs twisted out, or the Cheetah standing up like a circus horse).<br /><br />Note that a cheaper, condensed version of this guide, without the first 3 shortcomings listed above and more practical for field use is now available: [[ASIN:0691122393 The Kingdon Pocket Guide to African Mammals]]. It is probably the book you would want to take to Africa while keeping this one at home for reference.book you would want to take to Africa while keeping this one at home for reference.	2004-06-17

It did not!<br />For a start, it is surprisingly detailed and well-organized. The editors have resisted the usual temptetion of cramming too many similar or small species on one page. Usually there are just 5-6 species on each page, sometimes 7 or just 3-4.<br />What this means is that illustrations are big enough to show detail, plus there are often 4 or more different illustrations for the same 1 species, showing different colour morphs, juveniles, females, birds in flight, head or wing details, etc.<br />It also means that the maps and text for each species could be placed on the page facing its picture.<br />The text itself is still amazingly detailed for a book of this scope, giving the essential information on distribution, appearence, habitat, status and voice.<br />Too good to be true? Well, some of the illustrations show important colour or pattern details wrongly, even contradicting description in the text - in these cases the text tends be more accurate, so have a look at that one, too!<br />But all in all, this book is a great value introduction to the bird fauna of Africa, though perhaps unsurprisingly, I found it a bit too bulky to carry on the field.<br /><br />Note that while shown here as out of print, another edition of the very same book by another publisher is still readily [[ASIN:1868728579 available here]]!	2004-06-12

It is basically a checklist covering nomenclature, range, regional variation (subspecies), and sometimes essential features distinguishing similar species. A basic distribution map is provided for most species, though drawings illustrate only a few, so this is obviously more of a reference than a field guide.<br />It is particularly useful for regions like much of Indonesia, whose fauna is yet to be dealt with in detail in any separate book.<br />Unfortunately, with all the recent discovery of &quot;new&quot; mammal species in various parts of the region, this book is no longer truly comprehensive and an updated edition would be very welcome.	2004-06-12

In the &quot;Getting There &amp; Away&quot; section after each town/destination, it was merely mentioned that buses do run there (surprise, surprise!), but no information on how long they take and how much they cost.<br />That is exactly the kind of practical information people usually buy Lonely Planet guides for, and I don't think I have ever seen another LP guide that didn't have them...<br />The 2 stars were given as it does give information about major sights, but given how poorly-researched the practical information is, I would be surprised if the rest was accurate.<br />This may just be the worst LP guide of all.	2004-05-23

She barely stops even at those islands where her ship passed, yet is quick to make far-reaching conclusions.<br /><br />On page 219:<br />\\"On the nearby Kai islands... my heart sank as I saw that coarse grass now dominates the hills that Wallace desribed as inexpressibly beautiful... No-one will know what biological treasures existed there.\\"<br />Well, had she bothered to take a short boat trip from Tual, the capital of the Kai Islands, to the larger island of Kai Besar, she would have found forest and fauna largely intact. But if one only visits the major town on a smaller isle...<br /><br />On page 218:<br />\\"Seram is perhaps the only place in South-East Asia where you can walk continuously through undisturbed lowland forest...\\"<br />For all the qualities of the relatively small island of Seram, there are far greater expanses of rainforest on the great islands of Sumatra, Borneo, etc.<br /><br />On page 220, she claims:<br />\\"In Sarawak, where Wallace  'collected his Orang-utans, no Orang-Utans exist any more.\\"<br />Oh dear.<br />The orangutan is probably the single best-documented species in the entire region, and an estimated thousand of them are still found in Sarawak's Lanjak Entimau Wildlife Sanctuary and Batang Ai National Park (which I have visited myself).

The Christian Ambonese became a pillar of colonial rule after earlier harsh policies (notably the spice monopoly) towards all Moluccans had been changed for preferential treatment of Christians in education and military service in the 19th century.<br />Also interesting is the description of the era of Japanese occupation during the 2nd World War, when the Indonesian nationalists and Muslims were favoured.<br />Finally, the period leading to RMS and eventually Indonesian rule is examined in great detail.<br />The first, introductory chapter gives a good picture of traditional Ambonese social structure, and describes earlier history of these islands - unfortunately very briefly.<br />Easily the most detailed historical treatment of these islands - and a very thoroughly-researched, objectively presented one at that. It is also useful as background reading to understanding some of the underlying causes/factors of the horrible sectarian violance that devastated these islands in 1999-2002.<br />Unfortunately, like all the best books on the history of Maluku, this one is also out of print and hard to find now.	2004-04-24

After he had died of cancer, his parents published some of his photos and the tales he collected in this book.<br />Unfortunately they have done so knowing nothing about Papua.<br />The result is a collection of potentially interesting tales that are not accompanied by any note on which region or ethnic group they come from. This is a pity, as they seem to come from varied regions, judging from those few that contain place names.<br />Ditto the photos and drawings that are used as illustration: no information on what they show or where they were taken. It is obvious though that many were NOT taken where the tale in question was collected - highland photos accompany coastal stories.<br />Even the translation is suspect. Basic Indonesian kinship terms (like adik = younger brother, or kakek = grandfather, but used as grandmother here!) appear as capitalized personal names in the English text!<br />All in all, the tales might be interesting if you just want to read them for their own sake (maybe for children?).<br />But if you are seriously interested in the fascinating oral traditions of West Papua, you'd be much better off buying the following book, containing a more extensive collection of folk-tales/myths from the Lani people and accompanied by great background info: [[ASIN:0761807608 Vernacular Christianity Among the Mulia Dani]] by Douglas James Hayward.	2004-04-20

While this might be of interest to some, it isn't directly linked to the main topic, and may make some readers put the book down with boredom.<br />Secondly, it deals in greatest length with examples of language extinctions from the historical past: Latin 'killing' European languages, English 'killing' Celtic ones in centuries gone by. Again, these are of some interest, but have little to do with the situation today, when minority languages face unprecedented pressure from globalization, television and universal education, none of which were factors centuries ago.<br /><br />Therefore I think the present/recent examples would have deserved more detailed coverage.<br />They do get some to be fair, but not as much as they should.<br />As usual, the emphasis among current examples is on native North American languages, a group already spoken by very few only, and mostly doomed.<br />There are also interesting examples mentioned from Australia - but described as mere anecdotes.<br />Finally, this book does give at least some coverage to countries where most of the presently still existing languages are being spoken under heavy pressure from a 'national language': eg. Indonesia, the Philippines or Nigeria. Unfortunately the interesting and complex situation in these countries receives a far less-detailed coverage.<br /><br />All in all, this book is interesting and will hopefully go some way towards raising awareness of this important issue.<br />Because of the disproportionate emphasis on old history and the situation of minority languages in English-speaking countries, I would actually only  rate it only 3-4 stars, but I gave it 5 to even out an unfair 1 star rating of a silly \\"review\\" (which has now been removed)long sitting below mine.and the situation of minority languages in English-speaking countries, I would actually only  rate it only 3-4 stars, but I gave it 5 to even out an unfair 1 star rating of a silly \\"review\\" (which has now been removed)long sitting below mine.	2004-04-08

The role of two different education systems (secular & religious) coexisting in today's Indonesia is examined, and is found largely responsible for the basic division of the young people of Ternate into \\"secular modernist\\" and \\"orthodox Muslim\\" groups.<br />Young men and women of both types are introduced by selected biographical portraits, and quotes of comments by local youth are inserted to illustrate their views on issues throughout the book.<br />An interesting chapter is devoted to the official youth organizations under the Suharto era, described as \\"Youth Politics without Youth\\". There is also much insight into the New Order system offered elsewhere in the book.<br />This is another title that can be very hard to find, but it can still be ordered from Germany by writing to: vfesbr@aol.com<br />Highly recommended for those who are interested in the life of Moluccans as it is today, and may also go some way towards explaining some aspects of the inter-religious conflict of 1999-2002.	2004-04-02

Most sightings were by chance, often on remote offshore islands or when hiking in rugged interior mountains. No less interesting - and far easier to locate - were their huge incubation mounds, or some well-known nesting grounds where they gathered in masses, like the beach near Simau village on Halmahera Island.<br />But observing these shy birds in the wild was always a difficult task, so I was very pleased to be able to obtain all information about their life, status and taxonomy I could think of in this extremely thoroughly-written book.<br />Highly recommended to anyone interested in this very special group of birds.	2004-03-13

Though written as a novel, the author has obviously done his research and tried to summarize all factors, events and characters involved in the real conflict in a short book.<br /><br />On the positive side, his general conclusions about the causes of the conflict are pretty correct. He has even managed to remain more impartial than most Westerners writing about this conflict by pointing out that attrocities were also commited by the Christian side, and even making a Muslim the main hero of his story.<br />The role of the Army and the character of its leaders are also well-described.<br /><br />The devil is in the details, which are more errorous.<br />The island he describes is placed in South Maluku, yet has a neglected sultan - in reality sultans only ever ruled North Maluku, where they have always commanded much respect. The South has rajas instead, both among Christian and Muslim communities.<br />The main spice of the fantasy-island is called \\"noli\\" - but its description is so obviously of nutmeg that it left me wondering why call it by any other name?<br />The chronology of the events described is wrong. For one, he claims that strife in Ambon started with Muslims attacking the Christian-run market! Anyone familiar with Ambon knows that until the troubles Muslims ran the markets there, which was in fact correspondingly burned by Christians first. Then the incident of forced islamization on Kesui is described as having happened soon after the initial outbreak of violance - in reality it happened much later...<br />Generally, the long phases of the conflict that took 4 years to run its full course in reality take place in a matter of days, weeks and months in this book - which might well leave readers bewildered on how things can change so rapidly.<br />And while the characters are nice and moving, I found them less than life-like - but more idealization of them might be justified in what is a novel after all.<br /><br />Maybe I only noticed the above as I myself spent much time throughout Maluku during this conflict over the past years and hope to have got to know its people and history better than most visitors.<br />This has probably made me a somewhat critical reader - but even so I would still say that all things considered, the author has tackled the difficult task of making this cruel conflict comprehensible to the wider public pretty well.be justified in what is a novel after all.

Much of their findings confirm what had been published in other books or media sources earlier, though they do add the interesting fact that the OPM themselves are partly responsible for forcing West Papuan refugees to PNG.<br />But while this book may not add much to one's knowledge to the politics of this troubled land, it does remain one of the best travelogues about Papua, for in addition to the usual destinations like the Baliem Valley, the Asmat region and the Jayapura area, they also visit places usually ignored by travellers like the interior of Sorong, Midiptanah and transmigration settlements near Merauke and Arso.<br />However, their conclusions reflect the situation as seen 20 years ago - many of the places described are rather different today.	2004-01-20

After a short overview of the history of Papua, particular attention is paid to the early history of the OPM guerilla movement, to the economic importance of the province to Indonesia (based on local government statistics), the Freeport mine, and events between 1995-1999.<br />While individual cases of human rights abuses are mentioned, the major focus of the book is the impact of Indonesian economic development and the accompanying demographic changes and environmental damage on the life and future of the Papuans.<br />Its conclusion, that independence is the only way the native Papuan people can survive, is hopefully incorrect as in view of recent political developments in Papua independence seems an even less likely outcome today than it did when much of this book was written.	2004-01-15

Even books devoted to Maluku in general, or Southeast Maluku in particular offer very limited information about this unique archipelago which lies in the shadow of New Guinea to the East, or the art-rich islands of Southwest Maluku (like the Tanimbar or Leti groups) to the West.<br />When I visited the Arus in 1999, I could find very little information about them, yet eventually ended up spending a week among the very same people described in this book, whom local Arunese recommended for being the most traditional. Several times I was told about a Western woman who had spent time there doing research years earlier, attending local festivals, and who must have been the author of this book.<br />It was all the more interesting to finally (and accidentally) find this book published a few years later.<br />In addition to the wealth of detail about the culture of the Barakai people it also offers much information about the Aru Islands in general.	2004-01-12

Even failed and highly repressive Dutch colonial policies are given a sympathetic treatment by Wallace.<br />Unfortunately, having become such a classic, some of the dated conclusions of this book are still being reproduced in new works published about this region nowadays, nearly 150 years later!<br />So I would say that while this book is certainly worth reading as an account of how things were in Wallace's time, one should never forget when it was written.

This way she had the chance to witness rare traditional events that few visitors see, and to make close enough friends among Christian Ambonese to hear personal accounts of local superstitions.<br />She had such an eye for detail that her highly entertaining book is even quoted as a useful etnographic reference in bibliographies.<br />Nor is the book about Ambon alone. The author did travel around South Maluku whenever she could, describing Saparua, Seram, Banda, the Keis and even the remote Watubela Islands.<br />Her only failure is that having spent all her time among the Christian half of the Ambonese society she gives only the shortest, and often mistaken remarks about the Muslim Ambonese (based on her city impressions she says Muslims are mostly immigrants from elsewhere - this is certainly not true in rural parts of Ambon Island) who do make up half the population there and actually preserved more of the traditional culture. But this is just a small shortcoming in what is otherwise a brilliant book.<br />It is a pity that it is out of print now - fortunately cheap second-hand copies are usually available on Amazon's UK site!	2003-11-08

It is well worth having on a trip to Nusa Tenggara, even if you already have the general Indonesia guide (whose coverage of this region is far less extensive).<br />If only all LP guides were written by this author!<br />A word of warning though: despite the title, this book DOES NOT cover most of Indonesia's eastern islands, only the smaller region of Nusa Tenggara or Southeastern Islands.	2003-11-08

Like those reviewing it before me, I struggled to get through even those chapters relevant to the Moluccas.<br />Still, it is an important and valuable first hand account of a remote region and of course of a truly historic voyage.	2003-11-08

It is probably the most thoroughly-researched, best-written history of Maluku (especially North Maluku) ever written. All historical events described are cross-referenced with the sources.<br />The book is remarkable in that it puts an emphasis on trying to describe the troublesome history of contact between Malukans and Europeans from the native as well as the colonial point of view.<br />Unfortunately this book can be very hard to find but is certainly worth the trouble!<br />Can't praise it highly enough...	2003-11-08

Seeing its forbidding price here I realize how lucky I was to pick up an Indonesian edition for just a few dollars...<br />An extremely throughly written book dealing with all imaginable aspects of orangutan conservation, pulling no punches when pointing out mistakes made by conservationists so far.<br />I can't recommend it highly enough to anyone seriously interested in the survival of these apes.<br />If you have already read more popular books like Birute Galdikas' \\"Reflections of Eden\\" or Linda Spalding's \\"A Dark Place in the Jungle\\" and are left wishing for more balanced, serious information you could find nothing better than this one.<br />Pity for the price!	2003-05-17

Even a quick look at the regional maps will confirm that all hikes described only cover relatively small areas.<br />So those planning a longer trek through the backcountry of Japan might be disappointed (I was, anyway), but I understand we are just the minority...<br />On the other hand, those looking for advice on a variety of short hikes in national parks or near the major cities will find lots of good ideas, and practical details that tend to be amazingly correct by guidebook standards!<br />Don't worry too much about the book being a few years old - Japan is such a stable country that much of the information remains as valid as ever.	2002-12-15

Needless to say, lots of that is wrong.<br />This may just be a blessing in disguise however, as most remoter islands of Maluku are ill-equipped to cater for tourists, and those determined to visit such places will find discovering them on their own all the more exciting.<br />I'd still recommend this book for anyone interested in Maluku, but would warn against expecting too much from it!<br />In fact, general guidebooks to Indonesia by [[ASIN:1741044359 Lonely Planet]] and Rough Guides (strictly the [[ASIN:1858284295 1st edition]] only!) contain just as much info on the sights and facilities of Maluku as this book, and are certainly more up to date.<br />But if you find all these too limited, you will just have to wait and see things for yourself!	2002-12-15
