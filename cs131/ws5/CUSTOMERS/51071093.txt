This book by Angier is just such a pile of speculative junk.  And poorly written and poorly organized to boot.  <br />Mind you, I am a fan of \\"analytical\\" biography & history.  Where the author does not just narrate but attempts to interpret the facts & to tease out conclusions.  Angier has gone so much farther than that.  Since she speculates without facts and ignores existing facts (which is to say, the material in Primo Levi's own wonderful writings).  She turns an interesting man, a fascinating man into a pathological man, who is no more than her (made up) aggregation of psychological complexes.<br />I am so disappointed in the NY Times Review of Books for having featured this volume on the cover of their publication this weekend.  Angier should pay me for having read it.  Instead, I paid her.<br />Instead of wasting your money on this junk, buy a complete set of Primo Levi's works [...].  And if you own them already.  There is nothing better, I think, than reading the Periodic Table again.	2002-06-15

Kupperman pulls out of the dustbin of the archives the intriguing story of Providence Island, off the coast of central america &amp; in the midst of then-powerful spanish colonies, to elucidate the motives of the puritan founding fathers.  By so doing, Kupperman adds greatly to our often stereotyped insights about the differences between the &quot;US&quot; colonies (most notably, Massachusetts &amp; Virginia), and the influence of environment, composition of migrants, &amp; support from the home island.  Kupperman also brought to my attention, for the first time in so bold a way, the hooks between the puritan founding class &amp; the englishman who overthrew Charles I &amp; involved themselves, in one way or another, in the administration of Cromwell.	2001-11-11

Games successfully combines her torturous mining of the archives of the UK, Bermuda, US &amp; elsewhere, with a good understanding of statistics, with intellectually honest speculations about the data (where it exists &amp; where it does not, carefully showing where each hold), with a comprehension of the sweep of history in which this work fits, with a fine writing style.  This book is denser than most colonial history, but it is worth pushing through that density for the unique insights the history carries with it &amp; the stimulation of mind the book provides to the reader.  Fundamentally, as Games shows, history is about ordinary human beings.  The aggregation of their actions is what makes something worthy of the historians attention.  In Games work, we can see the individual actions of UK &quot;citizens&quot; in the 1500s &amp; 1600s in making the trek to colonies.  This book should be on anyone's required reading list for understanding what happened in the British colonies early-on.	2001-11-11

The book is filled with detail of the day-to-day travails of the seaman &amp; officers, and interesting speculation about the relationships between major players in the drama.  The book would be of particular interest to people intoxicated with the sea &amp; sailing, since there is plenty of information about how sailing &amp; navigation was done (right &amp; wrong by this group) in the early nineteenth century.  Where I found the book to be weak is in the general history, the context in which all this occurred.  I prefer a book that uses an incident like this as a centerpiece to elucidate the social, political, economic, cultural situation of the day.  Philbrick does this, in places, particularly in the first few chapters, but then the book degenerates, or better said, narrows its view to the Essex voyage itself, abandoning the historical context.  The book would have been much much longer &amp; less focused had it taken the approach I suggest ... but it is nevertheless the approach I prefer.  That is why I gave it a 3.	2000-12-08

Unless you were a comp. lit. major &amp; also understand Indian &amp;  Muslim politics.  I have no doubt that those books are &quot;great&quot;  but they are a hard read if you want to really follow all the allusions.   The Ground Beneath Her Feet is a much more accessible work that shows  Rushdie's brilliance without overwhelming the reader with obscure allusions  (it does, of course, help to be well read in some of the classics &amp; in  Indian history, however).  Two aspects of Rushdie's strengths are most  manifest -- his ability to write beautiful sentences and his ability to  intertwine multiple plots together into a beautiful, elegant &amp; coherent  whole.  And, of course, the book has an intoxicating ryhthm -- which goes  with one of its themes -- the music of 2 of its 3 protagonists -- that  keeps the reader wanting to go on, to learn more about the misadventures of  the characters.  I recommend this book highly.  Don't be put off by any  experiences you've had with other works by this author.	2000-08-06

The author, I believe, successfully resurrects Burr from the usual dustbin historians like to put  him in, while at the same time, showing many of the warts on the sometimes  sterling-looking characters of Hamilton &amp; Jefferson.  With respect to  these latter, the author does not bring out alot of new information ... the  book is not too strong on Jefferson &amp; a bit more on Hamilton.  For the  interested reader, there are numerous books on these two, so you needn't be  too disappointed by the short shrift they get here.  There is not alot of  extant writing on Burr, however, so this book is a welcome addition to the  literature.  I disagree with some of the other reviewers about the  treatment of Burr here -- the author shows that he was a man of his times,  not that he was any saint. The author shows that his western expedition can  be put into a context of expansionism, and that his 3 treason trials can be  put in the context of both political rivalry (with Jefferson) and early  political debate about slavery (Burr was a powerful anti-slavery advocate).   The reason I gave the book only 3 stars was not because the book lacks  originality or original information or interesting interpretations of  already known facts.  It has all that.  I just felt it could have been  written better ... with a less peculiar style that made it more readable.   The book seems to have needed a better editor.  Or perhaps Kennedy was  &quot;experimenting&quot; with a different stylistic approach that didn't  touch my fancy.	2000-07-03

You see, Dr. Fischer was a professor of mine at Brandeis, many years ago, by  far my best &amp; most personally influential professor of either my  college or grad school years.  So I eagerly, too eagerly in this case,  await each volume he produces.  This book has alot of great information in  it, and it is beautifully produced, with well chosen, well reproduced  paintings, maps &amp; photographs throughout.  But in narrative style, it  is sorely lacking.  If you are looking for traditional narrative history,  this is not it.

The Shoemaker  &amp; the Tea Party is just such a volume of interpretive history.  The  book consists of two historical essays, the first of which dredges  everything we could possibly find out about the Shoemaker &amp; his  involvement in historical events ... the second which evaluates how the Tea  Party has been viewed through history as different &quot;powers&quot; have  had their hands on the rudder of historical interpretation.  This book,  like others about the early Republic, shows how our revolution was a  profoundly conservative event, not an event that challenged the social  structure of the colonies (except insofar as assets from the Tory elite  were confiscated by the revolutionary elite).  Although the revolution was  made by both the elite &amp; the workingman (tradesman &amp; farmers), it  was naturally the elite who chose to view &amp; to institutionalize that  view, historical events through their own eyes.  The importance of social  stability was paramount, hence the mob'ist origins of the revolution were  downplayed or ignored.  By the time this fellow, the Shoemaker, reemerged  in the 1830s, the course of our American History writing about this topic  was set in stone.  The revolution was not a chaotic, angry event, but a  smooth, patriotic one.  This is a short book, alittle pricey for its  length, but well worth reading.	2000-05-15

But Agnes  herself is at times a sympathetic character &amp; at other times, an  extraordinarily tiresome character.  I know that Cusk succeeded in getting  at the nub of the insecurity that woman (&amp; men) often feel in their  early-20's.  Insecurity about one's appearance, one's fitting-in, one's  job, one's relationships.  But after I read 100+ pages of Agnes cogitation  on these subjects, I was ready to read about something else, something  completely different.  I guess I am inpatient.  But I didn't enjoy the rest  of the book nearly as much as the first part, since Agnes' life seemed so  much drudgery.  Perhaps that is the way it is, sometimes, in real life, but  I don't have to spend all my leisure time reading about real life!  I have  a real life of my own!

Author does an OK job following his various lines of argument, to the point you believe him, but I was very bothered by two things in his writing (aside from the incessant rambling).  The first was the absence of a recognition that  chance must have played a big role in where we ended up ... but the author  seems convinced that the reader needs a rational, pattern-based explanation  for everything.  That is tantamount to biological determinism.  There  couldn't be an explanation for EVERYTHING.  The second &quot;bother&quot;  is that the author never, never ever, has an alternative explanation for  anything.  It would help alot if we had an idea of what the realm of  &quot;scholarly debate&quot; on some of these topics is.  Yet the book is  written as if nobody else ever investigated these issues, and came up with  an equally compelling argument contrary to this author's.  The author seems  intellectually honest enough to recognize that there are other explanations  for things, but he spends no time exploring those other explanations in his  rush to come up with a believable explanation of his own.  Alot of the  foregoing could be forgiven if only the book was well written.	2000-03-24

The book is useful not just for its anecdotal review of how credit cards got started &amp; how  they are used; and not just for the wealth of statistics it provides on how  card &amp; other payment usage has changed over the years; but most  importantly, by putting some structure around all that material so that we  can understand it coherently.  So many books on banking &amp; on industrial  development (like things by guru Tom Peters) are just so many anecdotes  strung together for 100s of pages, with no &quot;system&quot; for  understanding what's being talked about.  This book's strength is that it  provides the reader with a way of interpreting not only what's in the book  but with a way of understanding the incessant new developments in the  industry that we read about in the trade press every day.

First, the structure is obvious as an intellectual construct (something like watching a simpleminded movie in which you know the entire plot line in the first 5 minutes).
