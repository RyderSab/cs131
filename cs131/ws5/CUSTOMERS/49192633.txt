US	49192633	R28JCQVVSAVH9N	0679722769	705442339	Ulysses	Books	3	29	35	N	N	The Good, The Bad & The Ugly of Modernism	\\"Ulysses\\" is a deeply flawed work of genius that richly deserves both the bouquets and the brickbats that critics have hurled at it over the years. It is by turns a desperate struggle to free writing from the literary straightjacket of convention, and an unctuous exercise in literary hubris. It is one of the most definitive products of the modernist movement then in vogue and shares the inconsistency, contradiction and schizophrenia that plagues that movement, constituting a rejection of bourgeois conformity on the one hand while on the other yielding accessibility only to a literary elite.    \\"Ulysses\\" is many things: a literary experiment in variety and anti-style (different chapters are written in entirely different voices and forms); a rejection of Victorian conformity; a protest against method, structure and classicism; an attempt to transcend conscious boundaries; and not least, a gross and orgiastic display of literary exhibitionism.    There were few contemporary works that dared to take the modernist movement to such extremes. Faulkner wrote similar stream-of-consciousness works but ultimately anchored his writings to a foundation of literary convention that allowed ordinary readers to understand him. Joyce, while ostensibly writing ABOUT ordinary people, never wrote FOR them. He was the ultimate literary snob who, by this time, had grown so infatuated with obfuscation that he would follow up \\"Ulysses\\" with the utterly impenetrable \\"Finnegan's Wake\\".    There is something hypocritical about such an outlook: to extol the typical Irishman in writing that no typical Irishman could ever hope to understand; to reject not just established convention, but any appreciable sense of system at all; to push 'writing' entirely beyond the bounds of 'communication'.    What saves \\"Ulysses\\" is that, with this work at least, Joyce does not yet go entirely over to the dark side. He goes right to the edge, but only playfully puts one foot over. Despite its calculated obscurity, its see-how-brilliant-I-am experimentation, its auteur elitism, he doesn't quite abandon content for form. This would be the last work in which he holds on to reality, and his decision to anchor his work in at least SOME recognizable conventions allows us to see where he is trying to go.    This is a book that is far more important than it is either enjoyable or even readable. Its status as a \\"masterpiece\\" is problematic and misleading: since this honorific is earned if the work is judged by its incomparable technique and sheer audacity--but is undeserved if judged by its respect for the common man. This is a book written for literary highbrows--at times, one almost suspects that it was written solely for Joyce himself--and no one should feel obliged to wade through a morass of such literary contrivance. Those who do, however, can expect to glean many moments of brilliant revelation out of long stretches of teeth grinding frustration.	2005-03-31

He is writing schlock, knows he is writing schlock, and is having so much fun writing schlock that his delight is infectious. When some conniving wretch reaches a dramatic resolution, one can almost hear the welling orchestral accompaniment. Great fun. <br /> <br />It is refreshing to read a book that refuses to take itself seriously. Rather than masquerading as Something Deep, this book flouts its trash pedigree boldly. \\"Dahhling... have you ever met anyone so deliciously WICKED as Noelle? In the next chapter, we'll see just how much more WICKED Noelle can GET.\\" This book is campier than a pot-boiler on bennies. <br /> <br />Books like this must be written over-the-top, or they don't work at all. The characters have to be caricatures, the setting has to drip with decadence, the plot has to twist and plunge like a runaway roller coaster and the prose has to reach such heights of garish camp that the reader gets nosebleed. <br /> <br />And Sheldon delivers all this by the barge full. <br /> <br />The manipulative witch, the love'm-then-ditch'm playboy, the wide-eyed innocent and the implacable billionaire, all have their respective moments. But they aren't just moments, they are Moments - teary-eyed (or steely-eyed) close-ups - the pores hidden with pancake makeup. <br /> <br />While this type of camp-glam amusement isn't really my thing, I can understand its appeal. It takes personality types, pumps them full of steroids, then throws them into ridiculously overwrought situations to generate exactly the exaggerated absurdities that keep the pot burbling. If you like this sort of thing, Sheldon hits all his targets with the skill of an Olympic fencer.	2004-10-10

The Second World War had just ended, the Europe of his memory was in ruins, the full horror of the holocaust had been laid bare and the victorious powers seemed bent on completing the destruction the planet. The best of optimists would have quailed, and Orwell was no optimist. Surrounded by this stark despairing landscape, he wrote a stark despairing speculation. It was his damning indictment of the dark places of our souls.<br /><br />It has been called a masterpiece; one of the twentieth century's greatest prophecies; a visionary dystopia that will speak for all time.<br /><br />I beg to differ.<br /><br />I do not question the brilliance of Orwell's writing. It exactly conveys the utter dejection and despair that he felt in the aftermath of the war. It is an incredibly taut development of character, theme, setting, and plot that strikes our psyche like a fist to the stomach. It attains exactly the right balance between storytelling and polemic.<br /><br />It is also all wrong. It felt wrong thirty years ago when I first read it. It feels just as wrong today.<br /><br />If we ever manage to create hell, it won't be Orwellian. Humans are far more amenable to seduction than oppression. Why spy into every household when one can be persuaded to spy on oneself? Why use techniques as inefficient as torture when far more can be accomplished by appealing to our basest pleasures? Why need doublethink be forced when we will freely embrace it where it is invested with enough allure? And why would the denizens of a misbegotten future bother to listen to voices of discord when their every waking hour can be filled to excess with titillation, shallow ecstasy, and unending bombardment of the senses? The dystopia of the future will not be one of oppression, but of gluttony.<br /><br />An observant person, looking at the here and now, might conclude that hell has already arrived. But it has arrived via Huxley, not Orwell. We already have the Brave New World of test tube babies, mass pacification, casual sex, and broadcasted voyeurism. The key to keeping a society docile is to make docility so pleasant, so seductive, that we will freely and willingly embrace it over the rigours of a well-examined life. The road to hell is paved with syrup, not vinegar.<br /><br />Orwell was a brilliant thinker and writer, not just of fiction, but of social and personal commentary. His essays are probably the finest since Montaigne's, and his powers of human observation and his sheer intellect are overwhelming in their stature. This is what makes 1984 so difficult to understand. Such a keen mind should have arrived at very different conclusions from those exposited in this book.<br /><br />In a really hellish future, there will be no need to destroy malcontents; they will simply be irrelevant.	2004-10-10

Huxley is the smarmiest of the lot, and in Brave New World, he is so right, it hurts.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; this is a brilliant book. Of the various works of dystopian fiction written over the years, Huxley's strikes closest to reality. This is what makes it depressing.<br /><br />I first read this book decades ago, and it was the first work I ever read that portrayed the future as a hopeless mess. I remember hating it because it didn't fulfill my expectations for happy endings. When you are twelve years old, you expect stories about the future to have happy endings. I didn't understand much of it at the time, but even then, I realized that it was an intelligent work of great power, meant to do more than entertain. This may have been the first book I ever read that truly challenged me. For that alone, I owe Huxley a great deal.<br /><br />This work is invariably compared to Orwell's 1984. And while some critics say that they address two different themes, I beg to differ. 1984 may be about totalitarianism, and Brave New World may be about social utopianism, but they both share something more fundamental: they are cautionary tales about our innermost natures. They dissect our slavish need for order and our desire for a social framework to cling to, no matter how dysfunctional such a framework may be. The differences between the two works are in their conclusions, and here, Brave New World strikes closer to the truth.<br /><br />1984 asserts that we will accept the yoke of oppression before we surrender to anarchy. Brave New World asserts that oppression is unnecessary: that humans will re-engineer society if we have to, in order to suppress the desire for challenge that leads to unhappiness. If we look around us at the mass soporific of popular entertainment, the titillation of \\"Reality TV\\", the sensory overload of music videos, the casual attitudes to sex and drugs, the superficiality of relationships, and most of all, our increasing intolerance for even the slightest risk, it is the Brave New World that is coming into being before our eyes, and not 1984. Made to order babies, \\"feelies\\", sex purely for physical gratification, mass tranquilization, broadcasted voyeurism, \\"curing\\" of malcontents, bland political correctness, all may have seemed distant and surreal in Huxley's day, but they precisely describe our present society.<br /><br />This book asks us to consider whether \\"happiness\\" is truly a goal for which humans should strive. Or, more accurately, it asks us whether happiness, in and of itself, is a sufficient goal. Behind this question is a larger and more abstract one. What makes life worth living? We don't get much of an answer from Huxley, except his literary equivalent of a shrug. \\"Dunno,\\" he says, \\"but it sure ain't this.\\"<br /><br />The book suffers from artifice. Huxley dabbles in the stream-of-consciousness experimentation that was the literary rage of his day. It is jerky and inconsistent. As a writer, he doesn't believe in self-discipline. But to criticize this book for such failings is to read it for the wrong reasons. He is not writing classical literature, but speculative fiction. In fact, he is one of science fiction's pioneers.

The book itself is drivel; but the reactions to it form some of the most intelligent and enlightened reviews I have encountered. I have never sprinkled as many \\"helpful\\" votes within a single site as I have here, to both one-star and five-star appraisals alike.<br /><br />Firstly, the book itself. I cannot subscribe to any of the academic apologias. This book took an interesting concept and stretched it well past the point of absurdity. Like the surrealist movement that ultimately ended up justifying paintings of Campbell's Soup cans, \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" takes stream-of-subconsciousness to such idiotic lengths that it becomes self-parody.<br /><br />Yes, I have exhaustively analysed the book. I studied it many years ago under the tutelage of an infectiously enthusiastic English professor who dissected its every nuance. Puns, portmanteau constructs, auditory versus literary jabberwocky, dream-state evocation: we analysed all of these elements and more. And for a time, during my \\"intellectual\\" period, I pretended to admire it. Nowadays, age and--I like to think--wisdom compels honesty: this book is a self-indulgent conceit. Had anyone other than Joyce written it, it would never have been published, much less garnered all the notoriety it has enjoyed over the years.<br /><br />The real value in \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" has been in the intelligent debate that it has fostered. By stringing together chaotically connected thought fragments, Joyce created the literary equivalent of a star-field: any resulting patterns are a tribute to the richness of the readers' imaginations and not the writer's.<br /><br />Does Joyce's exercise constitute genius? Hardly. Artificial Intelligence research has produced numerous examples of similar jabberwocky constructs, some practically indistinguishable from \\"Finnegan's Wake\\". So what we have here is a sampling of the peculiarly human ability to impose order upon chaos. Some of these five-star reviews are testaments not to the meaningless jumble that is \\"Finnegan's Wake\\", but to the creative ingenuity of their authors and to the larger genius of the human imagination.<br /><br />Joyce was not a prolific author, but what he did produce was some of the best writing ever conceived. \\"Portrait\\", \\"Ulysses\\", \\"Dubliners\\": each is a star in the literary firmament. It is natural to try finding a place for his last work in the same firmament, but \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" doesn't deserve such elevation. This novel was the product of a genius who in the end became so narcissistic and self-absorbed that he dared to pen a scatter-brained homage to his own ego. Would we dismiss this work as vapid nonsense by any other author, it would be dishonest to do otherwise just because that author's name is James Joyce.e order upon chaos.

US	49192633	R18MP74DMWI9F2	0345459407	981903971	Perdido Street Station	Books	3	13	18	N	N	A Brilliant Self-Indulgent Mess	I don't take to horror, so this book had trouble punching my hot buttons, but perhaps some such reserve is necessary to critique this work with any sort of objectivity. <br /> <br />\\"Perdido Street Station\\" is a brilliant mess--it is equal parts originality, vivid imagination, artistic preening, and sheer sloppiness. For example, the author goes so far overboard conveying the smelly slimy decay of the urban streetscape that the narrative goes from descriptive to grotesque to outrageous to finally, laughable. It isn't necessary to club us over the head with page after interminable page of slime and stench and excrement. We get it. New Crobuzon is a disgusting place. There comes a point where relentless exposition destroys the very effect the author is trying to create. It inures us to any more disgust. <br /> <br />Another example. The book is filled with foul invective. Let me rephrase: it is not just filled but bloated to the bursting point. Now, I'm no prude and will resort to my share of salty phrases, but I understand the limitations of such language and reserve it for occasions when only a choice morsel will do. In this book, invective is sprayed about with such indiscriminate abandon that, once again, it loses all fineness of effect. It's like those pathetic juveniles on city buses who spout continuous strings of obscenities because they want to be shocking and considered dangerously grown up whereas such conduct only makes them look, well, pathetically juvenile. <br /> <br />This book contains ideas of striking invention. One cannot read about slake moths, remade, crisis engines or material manifestation of trans-dimensional psychic energies without admiring the ingenuity of the author. Moreover, his pseudo-Victorian steampunk setting is a perfect fit for the gothic horror he wishes to invoke. But such invention is coupled to inconsistencies of such absurdity that our suspension of disbelief is left in tatters. For example, the rarest specimens of the most awful threats to sentient existence are delivered to a top secret biohazard lab by... I kid you not... parcel post. The protagonist, a scientist with a presumably first class mind, rejects a loyal and courageous friend's need because he faults his friend for a crime that he himself commits to far worse degree just hours earlier. Then there is the contrived lingo. Everyone talks like druggies in pain, from scientists to politicians to--ahem--druggies in pain. And there are unnecessary affectations to the writing that are at best distracting, at worst artificial: chemicals are chymicals, electrical is elyctrical, worms are wyrms--you get the picture. <br /> <br />While brilliant and inventive, this book cries out for self-discipline. There is far too much exposition, too many adjectives, too much frenzy; too little restraint. There is, in fact, so much excess that it is hard to see where an editor could begin to sort it out. The narrative threatens to drown us in a sea of literary overkill. The author needs to turn down the volume and let the finer tones and textures come through. In this work, his verbal pummelling numbs our sensibilities until we are aware of only the most general outlines. This is a shame. Given that the author's world is already so ingenious, the addition of finesse and subtlety could have made the story one of truly haunting allure.	2004-09-12
US	49192633	R2H1BWGDR8276T	0451459652	960632728	The Last Light of the Sun (Kay, Guy Gavriel)	Books	2	16	22	N	N	A Third Rate Retread	I was glum after reading this book. Unlike Kay's finer works, it left me cold. In fact, it outright failed me. I kept searching for the pulse of life, but found only the flash and bang of spectacle. &#34;The Last Light of the Sun&#34; is nothing but a montage of depressingly one-dimensional characters. We never come to empathize with any of them like we do the wounded but irascible protagonist of his preceding work, &#34;The Sarantine Mosaic&#34;. <br /> <br />Character montages can only carry a story so far. For us to love the characters, to not just politely concede them their existence, their lives must have weight and not just affliction. <br /> <br />In Kay's previous works, we come to care for the central characters because they are complex and multifaceted. They elicit our empathy because they have layers, flaws and inner lives. But in this work, the characters are like the elements in a butterfly collection: devoid of life, but gorgeous enough to warrant pinning and display. <br /> <br />Kay's canon seems to swing between style and substance. In some of his past writings, he effectively captures the cadence of life; in others, he misses because he turns to his devices and falls in love with the lilt of his own writing while neglecting the honest literary craftsmanship that is necessary to impart substance and heft. In a world already psychedelic with colours and textures, we don't need yet another supporting character to add yet another hue. What we need is shape, definition, nuance and dimension in the MAIN characters. Instead, what we get is the Prodigal Son, the Redeemed Father, the Evil Villain, the Grieving Brother, the Noble King, the Imperious Princess, each nothing more than the thinnest stereotype of their kind, their one defining feature writ large. There is even the Faithful Dog. &#60;Sigh&#62; <br /> <br />Obviously, this book disappointed me. It possesses neither the subtlety, the substance nor the finesse that makes for a compelling read. The story is predictable, the setting insipid and the themes recycled. Given such failings elsewhere, the characterization must carry the whole weight of the novel, yet each character is incapable of supporting even its own burden. Frankly, I found the book formulaic and superficial--populated with caricatures more than characters. <br /> <br />I confess that some of my sullenness arises from a sense of betrayal. After reading stellar works like &#34;Tigana&#34; and the &#34;Sarantine&#34; duology, I had anticipated an intelligent and subtle book. To find myself instead wading through a mishmash of phoney characters is a bitter disappointment. Not recommended, even for Kay fans--perhaps ESPECIALLY for Kay fans.	2004-09-12

It is posh and elitist, set for the most part within the circles of the upper flakes of the Russian upper crust. It says little about commoners or the underclass, and what little it does say is shot through with a patronizing condescension that often shades over into caricature. In this regard, it reminds one of \\"Gone With The Wind\\", another book that recalls the past through a haze of selectively sanitized nostalgia. The difference, I think, is that \\"Gone With The Wind\\" focused on little more than the loves and lives of its characters. This turned it into nothing but well written soap opera. \\"War and Peace\\", on the other hand, speaks to a larger purpose. It tries to give us a sense of an ancient and honourable culture suffering through invasion and tottering at the edge of ruin. It is saved from triviality by its attempt to transcend the lives of its characters, an attempt at which it largely succeeds.<br /><br />It is a long book, much of it given over to digression, polemic and minutiae. Judged by modern writing conventions, it is too wordy, too literal and lacking subtlety. Contrary to the tenets of \\"good\\" writing, Tolstoy does not show; he tells. There is nothing of the oblique, the restrained or the quiet voice in his style. One suspects that a modern genius would write the same novel in a little over one third the length.<br /><br />But this book was written over a century ago in an age of simpler conventions. Their novels were the equivalent of our epic movies, with the same grand gestures, elaborate costumes and cast of thousands. One must be prepared to read the book in the context of its time and place, failing which the author's labours look staged and artificial. Who knows? Future generations may look upon our epic films in much the same way, seeing them as creatures captive to our times. But this would not strip these films of their greatness.<br /><br />This book requires not just an investment of time, but of patience. Impatience will destroy the experience more quickly than cheap cynicism. Tolstoy confounds us with such a tangle of characters, settings, plot lines and conflicts that at times one must chart out the profusion of interdependencies. Such thickets tie us up in brambles and roots. Sometimes, we are so bewildered by this underbrush that we forget to cast our eye upward to the forested cathedral above.<br /><br />And this is why this book is ultimately still worth reading. Despite its faults, it manages to attain greatness. It goes beyond the confines of singular lives to explore universal themes. It touches both the small and the large. It invests its characters with depth and strength of purpose, and it doesn't shrink from giving them human failings.<br /><br />I don't recommend this book for everyone. Frankly, those who look upon its length with a jaundiced eye are justified in their suspicion. It is not an easy read and demands more concentration than is dictated either by necessity or by good taste. However, it is a worthy read if you are curious about the Napoleonic invasion of Russia, the lives of the Russian nobility or just what the fuss is all about. And ultimately, there is more than enough substance to reward the determined reader.r />This book requires not just an investment of time, but of patience.

It takes its cue from the socialist stereotyping of materialism that pervaded the theatre of the 1930's and shamelessly goes on to gore its straw man with remorseless abandon. Today, it reads as blatantly biased, but given the tone and tenor of its time, this is a forgivable sin.<br /><br />This play is often included in grade school curricula as a superior example of mid-twentieth century theatre. This is done partly because its themes are simple and its language accessible, but also because, truth be told, it is a well-crafted play with meaningful characters and a significant message.<br /><br />Death of a Salesman is not a complicated play. It argues that capitalist materialism consists of fraud, hypocrisy and delusion, and its central character, Willy Loman, has embodied these traits so completely and for so long that he can no longer distinguish between meaning and emptiness. His wife and sons are not just ciphers, but complex people in their own right, and the fallout from Willy's values is so toxic that it leads to the forfeiture of their own chance at happiness.<br /><br />This play elicits mixed feelings because it straddles both the relevant and the simplistic. On the one hand, it accurately dissects certain aspects of western culture and the unthinking pursuit of riches. Our society does produce shallow unreflective wage earners who chase the almighty dollar to the exclusion of all else, and we have probably all met our own Willy Lomans before. However, the vast majority of the middle class do not conform to Miller's portrayal and, in this respect, Willy Loman resembles caricature more than personality. This feeling, that Willy Loman was constructed not so much to explore life as to score points, is what detracts from the general experience. Although the insights are both accurate and current, they are also simplistic, and the reader cannot shake the feeling that Willy Loman is an artifice that was built up in just such a way that he could later be knocked down to best press the playwright's agenda.<br /><br />So this is the reader's dilemma: the central character is a caricature, but a finely wrought one; he is used to make a point, but a worthy one; the playwright preaches, but does it well. This play reminds me of Dickens's best work, where charming Cockneys, implacable revolutionaries and other memorable characters of remarkable distinction were used to promote similarly simplistic and partisan agendas. Those who can forgive Dickens should be able to enjoy this play. Those who find Dickens too barefaced will have problems with this work too.ing that Willy Loman is an artifice that was built up in just such a way that he could later be knocked down to best press the playwright's agenda. <br /> <br />So this is the reader's dilemma: the central character is a caricature, but a finely wrought one; he is used to make a point, but a worthy one; the playwright preaches, but does it well.

I had found Tehanu so mundane and pedantic, so unfaithful to the original spirit of Earthsea, that I had resolved not to read any further additions to the cycle. This resolution did not arise from petulance or spite, but from a genuine fear that any further destruction of the Earthsea universe would bleed whatever delight remained to me out of the Earthsea that I had once loved. Such fears proved to be groundless and I am glad that I read this collection. <br /> <br />In this collection, Ursula Le Guin revives the magic with which she imbued her first three Earthsea books and that was so sadly sacrificed in the fourth. The result for the reader is like a homecoming. <br /> <br />She doesn't retreat from the feminist perspective espoused in that fourth book. Many of these stories look at the world through a woman's eyes. But unlike Tehanu, in this collection, she rediscovers the grace, dignity and evocative charm that were at the centre of the original trilogy. We can believe that we are visiting a different world: one where magic is a part of everyday life, where imagination takes flight and where dragons ride the winds. While some of the short stories may be about pain and loss, we are never in danger of mistaking the world of Earthsea for the plain old world of Earth. <br /> <br />The various stories explore themes of madness, power, sexism, vengeance and intransigence. These are more politically charged themes that make the stories less universal than those of the original trilogy, but unlike Tehanu, here they are handled with a sensitivity that largely redeems them. The polemic that destroyed Tehanu is not entirely dropped, but is sufficiently subdued that it no longer occupies centre of place. The emphasis shifts back to the dramatic.

After the plodding banality of Le Guin's previous novel \\"Tehanu\\", which all but ruined the world of Earthsea, this latest work is a resurrection.<br /><br />One suspects that Le Guin wrote \\"Tehanu\\" as penance for making the first three books in the series so male-centric. The resulting novel straddled the worst of all worlds: combining insipid un-fantasy with a hectoring message that read like a sermon more than a work of speculative fiction. In \\"The Other Wind\\" she gets it right. This latest work contains themes similar to \\"Tehanu's\\", but they are shown rather than told, revealed rather than reproached. Le Guin also achieves a balance between the male and female perspectives that leaves one feeling enriched and not browbeaten. \\"The Other Wind\\" is an altogether nobler creature.<br /><br />Le Guin's writing has always been in a class of its own, but here, it ages like fine wine. She writes with a poetic austerity that provokes affectionate admiration. Her characters live and move in three dimensions, and think and feel in a universe filled to overflowing with thinking and feeling.<br /><br />This story is a philosophical reflection on life and death; not surprising since each book in the series was a similar reflection. But in this one, Le Guin resolves the open questions that she left unanswered in the previous works. I would have been perfectly happy with her leaving those questions unanswered--as incitements to thoughtful readers--but I am content that she has answered them, and in a way that is so complete and fulfilling, yet so totally consistent with the world of Earthsea. This work inspires metaphysical reflections, yet does not demand them. It can be read as a simple story of courage, compassion and resourcefulness, or as an existential allegory of Being and Nothingness. Indeed, it is both: the genius of the author resides in her ability to meld story and philosophy so flawlessly that the novel speaks to us on both the simple and the profound.<br /><br />This is the kind of patient gentle writing that will appeal only to those in no hurry. Containing little of adventure or intrigue, it is the work of an author who is \\"done with doing\\" but, fortunately, not done with living or with writing.<br /><br />There are quibbles. As a stand-alone novel, it is confusing and too dependent on the reader's familiarity with the preceding works, and the prose is sometimes so austere that it hazards obscurity. But such blemishes are niggling. The novel as a whole is a mature piece of art--a gentle work of the soul that embodies a lifetime of reflection on what it means to live, to create, to face death and to touch those whom we cherish.and philosophy so flawlessly that the novel speaks to us on both the simple and the profound. <br /> <br />This is the kind of patient gentle writing that will appeal only to those in no hurry.

I remember the first time I watched this play. I believe it was Lee Marvin's portrayal of Hickey on a presentation of American Playhouse. I was held from first to last with that jaw-gaping awe that only the best dramatic works can inspire.    This is a rare work of the highest measure. It combines its existential angst with portrayals so uncluttered that we are spared the usual contortions of the literati. To be sure, there is symbolism and allusion enough: the entire play takes place in a bar called \\"Hope\\"; the setting is a meat packing district, literally the most dead end of dead ends; Hickey sells for a living, a profession that trades on hopes and fears. But these are just passing nods to the writer's craft. O'Neill includes them to keep the acolytes happy. The story depends on neither its setting nor its devices. It would work as well set in some professional clubs I know.    This play is concerned with the necessity of delusions. The various characters assembled around the bar waiting for Hickey's appearance are different flavours of delusion. It's like Dante's Inferno, with each character defining a different circle of hell. And when Hickey shows up, his effect is not much short of Satan's.    No one could write a play like this today. We have become a society so steeped in cool cynicism that we have lost our authenticity. Today, a theme like O'Neill's could only be invoked with a veiled smirk. Think of all the recent movies that have dealt with this thesis: they are either clichd, cruel or contemptuous. Consider, for example, \\"American Beauty\\". Delusion is a topic we approach with patronizing disdain for fear of seeming earnest.    What is the line between delusion and hope? Is hope itself delusional? Perhaps all humans are fundamentally flawed and can only avoid despair by wrapping ourselves in a cloak of unreality and fantasy. Hope is a crutch; avoidance is therapy; unflinching reality leads only to death or to madness. Heavy stuff.    It doesn't matter whether you agree or disagree with O'Neill's thesis because this play wasn't written to advance a specific point of view; it was written to exorcise demons. All of O'Neill's great plays were, to varying degrees, products of his suffering. This one came closest to connecting his personal pain with universal aspects of the human condition. This theme scares us because we are all so very vulnerable to self-delusion, and O'Neill's unsparing scrutiny exposes our own fear and pain so candidly that we are forced into self-reflection and humility. This empathy is at the heart of all the great tragedies: we could be as foolish as Lear, as jealous as Othello, as ambitious as Faust, or as delusional as Hickey. Don't set yourself higher than these figures: there but for the grace of God go I.	2004-09-12

US	49192633	RCMOYC6P4PSLY	0300093055	853845831	Long Day's Journey into Night	Books	5	4	4	N	N	An Aching Cry From the Heart	Before dysfunctional families became talk show circus acts, they were used as morality tales to warn us about the wages of sin. When that dysfunctional family is a playwright's own, and when that playwright is as gifted as Eugene O'Neill, we get a work of genius that makes other morality plays look like cartoons.    Firstly, a warning: this is an utterly depressing work. It doesn't contain anything upbeat. The characters start at bleak and chart a passage to despairing. If you are the kind of person who can't stand angst, then this play is not for you. Long Day's Journey works on countless levels and addresses themes of surpassing worth, but pretty it is not. I can understand why some people would hate it. What I don't understand is why they would read it in the first place.    Now for the good stuff. This is a play that addresses sins like vanity, pride and self-deceit, but in a way that does not preach, beat its breast, or feel contrived. How characters of such obvious intelligence come to such a pass is what fascinates. Through the course of the play, we come to see that talent, brains and social standing are insufficient to life's sustenance; the vital ingredient is sternness of character, and each of the protagonists in Long Day's Journey suffer from failings of character to a greater or lesser degree.    The title is a poetic metaphor that echoes the course of the family's lives. Substitute 'suffering' for 'day' and 'hell' for 'night' and you will get a clear picture of the play's progression. It observes not only the classical unities of time, action and place, but strives for the Shakespearean in its elocution. O'Neill's language is magnificent--he achieves a spare eloquence that meets the tenets of open verse. This re-infusion of poetry back into the playwright's craft is not the least of his achievements.    Many existential plays achieve their thematic objectives by indulging in theatricality. Even good plays like \\"Death of a Salesman\\" or \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" suffer from a sense of artifice. But \\"Long Day's Journey\\" feels genuine to its core. This is not a product of the imagination, but a story from a master storyteller who is baring his own soul. These are his own demons on display and the pain we feel stems from the fact that two of those demons are his mother and his father.    I don't know what it took for him to write this work. This is more a confession than a catharsis and one suspects that O'Neill derived no comfort or spiritual release from giving us this gift. We are the sole beneficiaries of his largesse, and this knowledge imparts a special sense of poignancy to the sympathy we already feel for its bent and wounded incumbents.	2004-09-12

It pounds away at its Message relentlessly, scene after scene, passage after passage, at times, word by word. Yet it moralizes with such dramatic skill, that we overlook the play's ruthless blatancy and are carried away by the force of its conviction. <br /> <br />I am not giving anything away when I tell you that this play is about the presumption of innocence, the evil of racism, the importance of moral courage and the meaning of citizenship. In fact, this is the sort of play that struts about, proudly parading its themes as brazenly as it can. There is nothing subtle, refined or nuanced about \\"Twelve Angry Men\\". It is about a man who finds himself holding a contrary conviction alone against a hostile mob and who finds not only the courage to stand up to them, but to reason with the mob until, one by one, he wins them over to his more enlightened views. <br /> <br />It contains everything that your English professor deplored: obvious themes, stereotypes, absurdly polarized action, melodrama, contrivance, and manufactured tension. Yet it works. It is not only unashamed of its coarseness--it is proud of it, daring us to call its plebeian pedigree into question. There are many enjoyable things about this play, not least its sheer audacity. <br /> <br />There is a lot of yelling, a lot of anger, a profusion of lurid dialogue directed at raising the temperature inside a confined little room. In one respect, the author chooses a perfect setting for his transparent psychological drama: the jurors in this play are themselves captives of the law, unable to escape until they have served their time and paid their dues to society. <br /> <br />I can understand how some may dislike this play for its lack of refinement. But I enjoyed it immensely. If it is coarse, it is also sincere. If it is high-handed, it is also unpretentious. For every moral that it bludgeons into our head, it takes pains to make sure that it is a worthwhile moral, and one now too often sacrificed to political convenience. Think of the terrorism suspects held for years now without open trial in Guantanamo. <br /> <br />We are blessed to live in a society that champions freedom, the worth of the individual and the primacy of law. This play shows how that blessing must be earned and reaffirmed every day. It shows that the defence of those values require more than just physical defence, but involve mental and philosophical defences as well. Mostly, this play shows that the strength of a society resides in its average ordinary people, and it shows this truth so powerfully that it forces its way into our consciousness, our consciences and ultimately our reflections on life. Well worth the read.	2004-09-12
US	49192633	R2YWQVQZRXFG3	0451525264	996904481	Les Miserables	Books	5	40	43	N	N	The Grandeur of the Human Spirit	Reading some of the criticisms of this masterpiece gives rise to a certain measure of despair. With so much to honour in this novel, what do these critics focus on? Its length. Its digressions. Its departure from modern writing conventions. It's like disparaging the teachings of Jesus Christ because He was preachy, given to parables and wanting a fashion sense.<br />Les Miserables is not an easy read. Worthy literature rarely is. Hugo takes pains to paint complete pictures of time and place, sometimes going on for dozens of pages just to set a scene. This is because he wrote before the advent of cinema, a narrative medium that has trained us to think in terms of pictures. As modern readers, we are well versed in such visualization, but Hugo's readers were not. Most had never seen a battlefield; had no idea about the horrors of war. Contrast this to the modern reader who has already seen a hundred depictions of battle before the age of ten. Is it any wonder that Hugo felt the need for exhaustive descriptions of settings that we take for granted?<br />This is a novel with many stories. But the arc of one life ties them all together. Jean Valjean is the warp that binds otherwise disparate wefts. He is more than the heart of the novel; he is its soul. Hugo indulges in a writer's conceit, showing us a man's passage from barbarism to the attainment of grace: the soul of the story on a journey of the soul. What a marvellous self-referential device. This is but an instance of the intelligence that informs this work.<br />The many characters that populate this novel all contribute to Valjean's spiritual journey. From the Bishop, he learns virtue; from Fantine, pity; from Cossette, love; from the nuns, humility; from Marius, patience. Even his implacable nemesis Javert has something to offer. In matching wits with him, Valjean learns courage.<br />Another warning: this book is melodramatic. It was written in a more innocent age, before the advent of cynicism and disdain. It is foolish to judge Les Miserables by current standards, and the fact that it may look naive to our jaded eyes says more about the failings of our times than the failings of the author. But insofar as it is melodrama, it is good melodrama. The author's sincerity is never in doubt. He puts melodrama to noble purpose and doesn't yield to false sentiment.<br />Consider the following passage from the book. Fantine has died and her child, Cossette, has been forced into slavery as a drudge. On a dark night, in the dead of winter, this little girl is tasked to haul water from a well deep in the woods:<br />&quot;She struggled with [the bucket] for a dozen paces, but it was too full and too heavy and she was forced to put it down again. After resting for another moment she resumed the struggle and this time got a little further before she again had to stop. Then she went on. She walked bent forward like an old woman, with the weight of the bucket dragging on her thin arms and the metal handle biting into her small chilled hands, pausing frequently to rest; and each time she put the bucket down a little of the water slopped down on to her bare legs. And this was happening to a child of eight in the woods at night, in winter, far from any human gaze. Only God was there to see, and perhaps her mother, alas, for there are things that rouse the dead in their graves.&quot;<br />&quot;Her progress was very slow. Although she shortened her periods of rest and forced herself to go as far as possible after every pause she reckoned that it would take her over an hour to get back in this fashion to Montfermeil, and that Mme Thernardier would beat her when she arrived; and this was a further distress to be added to the terror of solitude and the night. She was nearly at the end of her strength, and still she had not got out of the wood. Coming to an old chestnut tree with which she was well acquainted, she made a last pause, longer than the previous ones, so that she might be properly rested, then bravely started again; but such was her despair that she could not prevent herself from crying aloud - 'Oh, God help me! Please, dear God!'<br />The passage is clearly manipulative in the way all melodrama is, yet I defy anyone with a working heart to read this and remain unmoved. But this passage does not exist simply to milk our tears. Hugo is condemning the failings of his society with passion and with shame. It is unconscionable that a child of eight should be sentenced to a life of indentured servitude because bourgeois morality first destroys the mother and then throws away the child. Such melodrama is purchased with the dearest currency.<br />This book is so all encompassing, so finely textured, that we sometimes lose sight of its magnificence. The only phrase that does it justice is &quot;grandeur of spirit&quot;. This book, more than any other work of literature, epitomizes the grandeur of the human spirit. When Valjean dies, it is more than the death of a good and gentle man. Les Miserables occupies a place among the most vaunted tragedies because Valjean has penetrated to our innermost being. He represents all that is numinous about the human spirit, and his passing is the passing of greatness.	2003-11-19

Bolt has taken More and idealized him into almost mythical proportions. This is not difficult given that the historical reality was larger than life to start with, but those looking for insights into the real More won't find them here. The playwright was not striving for a biography. He wanted to use More as a launching point for a reflection on Being. This is in some ways a Platonic work, and in this sense, Bolt's idealization of More is entirely acceptable, and the play, entirely successful.<br />In a way, the play, idealized as it is, does not do the man justice. It presents Thomas More as little more than an ideologue. There is a reference to his friendship with Erasmus, but the real More was accounted one of the foremost philosophers of his time and enjoyed a moral prerogative throughout the western world that is difficult to credit in our own cynical age. The closest modern equivalent might be Martin Luther King or Mohandas Gandhi.<br />The play presents him primarily as a unique man of the world. However, as a true Renaissance man, More was of considerably broader genius. He gave us the word &quot;Utopia&quot; and formalized the concept within western thought through his writings on this namesake perfect society. His essays may seem dated and naïve today, but this is unfair, viewing them as we do through the filter of the intervening centuries. In addition to being a lawyer, judge and Chancellor, More was a scholar, author, essayist, philosopher and minister.<br />But the play is concerned with none of this. It focuses on one aspect of More's character: his acute sense of Self. The person of Thomas More commands our respect, because he possesses a strength of character that we all admire, some envy, and a few hate.<br />But where does this strength of character come from? Strangely enough, it's not faith, in the traditional sense of the word. The playwright uses faith as More's particular moral centre because it happens to be true in More's case. But we are allowed to generalize from More's case to our own, and Bolt argues that for every man, even the nonreligious, an unshakeable sense of Self is necessary for life to be worth living. More would not cross the line drawn by his faith because, in his case, his faith defined his Being. Is there a line we would not cross? A line defined by our own core values and beliefs? Contrast More's character to that of his foil, Cromwell, who embodies his antithesis, a life hired out to considerations of 'administrative convenience'.<br />In the end, we are our principles. Nothing less and nothing more. If we destroy our principles, we destroy our Being. You don't have to believe in the divine or in an immortal soul to understand the thesis at the heart of A Man For All Seasons.<br />This is an easy play to read and just as easy to understand. For all its literary beauty and thematic potency, it achieves a level of clarity that is missing in even the great classics. For this reason, some erstwhile intellectuals dismiss it as superficial. Ignore such snobs. This play is made the more wonderful by its accessibility, even to children, and certainly to intelligent youth who could do far worse than to start out on life's journey following the example set by such a man for all seasons.	2003-11-19
US	49192633	R1C2PJJ04LWBWZ	0345346904	289202770	Gateway (Heechee Saga)	Books	3	13	16	N	N	Ruined By Hollywood Angst	This book has some merits. Pohl paints a convincing miners' world by giving us a sense of its grit and stench. The lives of the miners are also handled well. The cramped seediness of their environment stunts their souls and this is crafted both believably and professionally. And, in spite of portraying Twenty-Third (?) century scientists as being unrealistically dense, the mystery of the Heechee is equal to any other creation in science fiction.<br />However, for all its strengths, this book didn't engage me. I found the angst of the main character both affected and contrived. And while his emotional self-flagellation was not central to the workings of the story, it kept distracting me from the more important elements. Consequently, I couldn't enjoy the story because of my resentment towards the book's heavy-handed artifice.<br />In this book, Pohl is so intent on teasing a multi-dimensional character out of a uni-dimensional kernel that he overindulges in Freudian excess. The main character is a parody of psychological trauma. His self-consuming guilt is advertised to the reader with all the subtlety of a highway billboard. Just as blatantly, our hero goes through unbelievable mental contortions to evade his real feelings. What we get is not a characterization we can identify with, but a painfully simplistic parody of an emotional breakdown. If despair and survivor guilt were really this superficial, psychiatrists would all be out of work.<br />Many readers unused to science fiction complain about the genre's tendency towards simple characters. This book illustrates why simple characters in the service of a good story are preferable to &quot;complex&quot; characters purchased with pretension. Grandmasters like Clarke, Asimov and Heinlein rarely created multifaceted or engaging characters. Yet some of these works proved to be classics because characterization was unimportant to the story. Here, a great story is felled by a misguided attempt to inject &quot;dimension&quot; into the hero when a simpler hero would have allowed the complexity of his world to take centre stage.<br />If you can get past the Hollywood angst, this book is actually a pretty good read with interesting ideas, settings and storyline. But it could have passed from &quot;good&quot; to &quot;great&quot;, and it's a shame that its excesses prevent it from achieving something grander.	2003-06-20

I am usually the first person to defend SF as primarily an exercise of the imagination. Consequently, flat characters, pedestrian writing and simplistic plots do not detract as much from SF as they would from other genres. The grandmasters of SF like Asimov, Clarke and Heinlein all suffer from literary inadequacy to varying degrees, yet they have all produced stellar works that must count among the classics of the genre.<br />By this measure, Ringworld should be entitled to the same consideration as the classics. So why are these same failings in this book so grating? The difference, I think, can be found in the authors' contrasting egos. Those other works do not try to make a virtue of their shortcomings. They acknowledge their weaknesses by making them the least significant elements in their respective stories. Such acts of humility predispose us to forgiving them their faults. But in this book, the author is unrepentant. Despite the fact that the characters, the writing and the plot are all weak, unexciting and predictable, these elements are still made the central features of the story rather than the supporting cast. It's almost as if Niven were daring us to take his literary shortcomings to task by shoving them in our face.<br />To illustrate what I mean, it is instructive to compare this work to something like Arthur C. Clarke's Rendezvous With Rama. The two novels share some remarkable similarities. They both take a tried and true scientific concept (an alien ark in Rama's case; a Dyson sphere in Ringworld's) and turn them into stories of exploration. Both novels tell a story of initial discovery, then the assembly of an exploration team, followed by adventures and revelations, and finally, escape back to human civilization.<br />But that is where the similarities end. In Rama, the characters are the least important part of the story. Consequently, their individual blandness does not matter because the characters themselves do not matter. Clarke realized that the only entity that really mattered was Rama itself. So he invested Rama with the mystery, intrigue and personality lacking in his human characters. The result was a spellbinding read because the focus was on the spaceship and the spaceship exceeded our expectations.<br />In Ringworld, the characters keep getting in the way of the setting. We are forced to consider their squabbles, foibles and pettiness, and in doing so, lose our focus on Ringworld itself. How much awe can discovery hold when the explorers of a new world spend most of their time bickering instead of exploring?<br />So while the best science fiction deserves to be judged as imaginative science, this novel demands that it be judged as fiction. Yet, this is precisely where it is at its weakest. I suppose that Niven's world still earns marks for its imaginative scope; but its failure to deliver on memorable characters, well crafted language or compelling story turns this particular novel into a sterile and unengaging bore.	2003-06-20

It's a work that leaves little room for ambivalence. Yet that is the reaction that it provokes in me.<br />Gibson's world is imaginative, his prose taut, his imagery vivid, his attitude a cocky swagger shoved in your face. So what's not to like?<br />Its very surfeit of style, is what. In fact, there's so much style that it overwhelms the substance. This, I suspect, is what his detractors can't stand. This book is smothered in style, from the various settings all reeking of decay to the punk fashion in the characters' dress to the throw-away jargon and mannered ennui that inform their speech to the staccato fragments that comprise Gibson's prose. Gibson's decision to enthrone style turns this book into the literary equivalent of a high fashion strut. Those who love it admire its flaunt, its poise, its very excess. Those who hate it despise it for the same reasons. Shouldn't science fiction be more intellectual fare?<br />I suppose it depends on your tolerance for excess. While Gibson overdoses on style, he doesn't vacate substance. His dystopian vision is as disturbing as Brave New World or 1984 (the very year this book was published). Neuromancer cautions us against corporatism, rampant consumerism, the seduction of immortality and the hive mind. It also speculates about artificial intelligence, bio-techno symbiosis, universal information matrices and the nature of reality. Such a substantive collection of themes is nothing to sneer at. But this book doesn't deserve the boatload of awards that it garnered either.<br />Personally, I have little tolerance for excess. I value restraint over indulgence, introspection over flamboyance. Brilliance shines brightest when freed from artifice. There is brilliance in this book, but it is buried under the mass of all that cool posturing.<br />Ultimately, this book is worth reading, not least for its numerous firsts. But discerning readersmust steel themselves against its cynical, oh-so-hip nihilism.	2003-06-20

I first read it decades ago, and it was written even earlier, between the two world wars when Captain America seemed something more than cardboard. This series hooked me on a lifelong addiction to science fiction, so I cannot view it impassively. It will always be associated with pleasant discoveries.<br />This series arouses so much nostalgia in readers that any criticism of it risks sending my review ratings into the toilet. However, maturity compels me to critique it honestly, and the light of objectivity reveals some harsh and ugly flaws.<br />First, the good stuff. This is an unpretentious series entirely devoted to plot. The superficiality of the characters doesn't detract. Nor do the simplistic, cartoon-like settings. The story barrels along like a runaway train, and performs admirably as escapist adventure fare. Think Buck Rogers meets Conan the Barbarian. And because it doesn't pretend to depth and doesn't employ any artifice, the simple-minded nature of the story is actually quite engaging. Moreover, the cheesy dialogue and the hammy characterizations are a lot of fun, adding to the Buck Rogers like feel.<br />But the series is also deeply disturbing. As a product of its era, it is burdened with the baggage of its insular xenophobia. Its rah-rah jingoism is not only grating, but troubling, especially in light of the fruits that such jingoism has since borne. Mindless chauvinism may be tolerable in dime novels, but not in science fiction, a genre that has always worked to expand horizons and promote a higher awareness. Here, the setting aside, we might as well be reading a comic book.<br />These books do not invite us to think. The good guys are obvious in the crudest sense of the word. The bad guys, even more so. And the death, genocide and mass exterminations that course through the series are all excused on the implicit understanding that bad guys deserve to die and good guys deserve to do the killing. I have heard this series referred to as a \\"classic of the genre\\" When I compare it to true classics of the genre like, 2001, Dune, Foundation, or Fahrenheit 451, where every loss is real and where death leads to anguished soul-searching, I cannot help but shudder at how utterly callow this series is.<br />If you think of science fiction as nothing more than pulp fiction in an unconventional setting, and you are prepared to discard your moral compass, then this series is a great action flick with its requisite allotment of pyrotechnics and mega-death. The good guys [prevail] while the bad guys get squashed like bugs. But if you consider science fiction to be something more than mindless fluff, if you expect it to engage you with a higher set of ethical values and touch upon the larger themes in life, then this series is a failure. One thing is certain: despite its pioneering pedigree and its many firsts, a \\"classic\\" it most assuredly is not.	2003-06-20
US	49192633	R2ILNTPALGM8Q5	0553278223	726968599	The Martian Chronicles (The Grand Master Editions)	Books	4	8	8	N	N	A Cubist Telling of the Red Planet	Mars has always played a big part in science fiction. From Burroughs's macho fantasies to Wells's merciless invaders, from Heinlein's strange land to Robinson's terraforming, Mars has been writ large in our imagination. But the current that runs through all of these works is of a world both coherent and uniform. The planet exists as a whole and is presented to us as a whole.<br />But if we stopped to think about it, how can a planet as immense as Mars be taken as a whole? If we looked deeply, wouldn't Mars present an infinite number of facets to our scrutiny? Wouldn't each facet tell its own unique and peculiar story?<br />This is what Bradbury does in &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;. The title serves as fair warning. This is not a conventional novel, but a set of chronicles: a collection of tidbits written to give us a taste of a place's boundless variety. And what a refreshing approach it is. In this work, Mars is more than just a setting. It becomes a personality; some days happy, some days sad; some days heedless, some days thoughtful.<br />Some of these vignettes succeed better than others. But taken in their entirety, they provide us with a breadth of feeling that would not be possible in a single uniform work.<br />However, if this were all that this work accomplished, it would be no more than an interesting exercise in technique. &quot;Chronicles&quot; really compels us because it touches our souls. Of all the science fiction greats, Bradbury strikes closest to the human heart. No one else can write quite his way; achieving that just-right balance between eccentricity and pathos, ordinary and fantastic; life and circumstance: living and breathing filtered through the orange mist of nostalgia. Nowhere does he strike that balance as well as he does here.<br />Nor should readers be put off by the abrupt changes. The various stories may jump from place to place and character to character, but there is a wealth of strong underlying themes that bind the varioussegments into a coherent whole. How do ordinary people respond to an extraordinary environment? Can intelligence overcome tribal instincts to embrace completely different beings? Can we ever, in the depth of our bones, truly make an alien landscape our home? Is our greatest challenge the conquest of space, or the conquest of human frailty? These are only some of the many worthy themes that run through the various episodes.<br />It's not perfect. I will be the first to admit that some episodes don't quite work. But what it lacks in consistent polish, it makes up for in nerve and originality. Bradbury is not content just to explore human themes. He chances unconventional approaches because the themes he wishes to explore are themselves unconventional. It takes literary guts to take such chances, and when they even half work, the composer deserves respect. In this collection, the general quality is so high, that it demands our appreciation.	2003-06-20

So, it isn't even a particularly interesting technique. This is why the assembled chorus of oohs and aahs are so disheartening. Have standards of readership really fallen so low that turgid potboilers can be reprocessed into art?<br />The effete intelligentsia crowd would have you believe that this book is a daring post-modernist feminist expose on the lives of three Really Interesting Female Persons. It is endlessly lauded for its supposedly unplumbed depth. The sort of thing Melville might have written had he been born a woman into the trash bin of Hollywood during its macho dominion days.<br />Don't you believe it.<br />This book is tripe. Oh, it is spry, titillating, breathy, voyeuristic, dewy-eyed tripe, but it is still tripe. It tells the story of three gold-diggers who prostitute their bodies and their souls for... well... this is the hard part. We don't quite know for what. I mean, we can understand the surface goals, like happiness and true love; but early on, it is made quite clear that none of them have any delusions about actually achieving such ends. So, we can only conclude that they prostitute themselves because that is the way they are wired. After this, whatever sympathy we can muster is of the sort we feel for salmon that must wriggle upstream to spawn before they die.<br />Many readers have said they can identify with the characters. This is scary. The characters are all shallow materialistic emotionally retarded twits. Others cite the author's writing. The writing is hackneyed cliche, filled with prose so purple it shames mashed beets. The camp-glam setting has been flogged to death in hundreds of films and thousands of books, and the themes are pop culture formulae straight out of prime time soap opera.<br />Ultimately, this novel sold a gazillion copies and begat an entire generation of trash that levelled whole virgin forests, because it scopes out the smelly underbelly of stardom. It gives us a vicarious taste of glamour and allows us to wallow with the pigs.<br />One can't get upset about such motives if they lead to honest writing. There are hundreds of hack writers I don't get the least worked up about. But unlike Susann, they don't take themselves seriously. This book is not good, and is not substantial enough to qualify as bad. It is just ugly. A phoney book by a phoney author about phoney people. If that's your cup of tea, you might like it. I prefer my schlock straight up, thank you.	2003-06-20

I just don't happen to agree. This book is a strange amalgam of originality and confusion, exotic imagery in the service of melodrama, bold visions in search of meaning. It tries for, but falls short of real depth.<br />I admired it for its spunk, its willingness to take risks, its determination to say something. But, in the final analysis, it is a failure: a respectable failure perhaps, but a failure nonetheless.<br />This is the sort of work where the writer leaves things ambiguous to afford us the freedom to reach our own conclusions. Normally, I would be beside myself with joy. Most writers do not respect their readership enough to take such chances, and to happen upon such boldness is a cause for celebration. If daring were the only criterion for good SF, Hyperion would constitute greatness.<br />But there is more to science fiction than daring. For one thing, there must be a sensible and coherent vision: something that aims for the mind and not just the heart, or in this author's case, the gut. This book fails because it suffers from a case of intellectual dissipation. The various episodes are almost sessions of free association. Only the most superficial threads connect the various stories. The common world that the characters share is made up on the fly; contrived as a vehicle for what is basically a pastiche of personal horror stories. This is simply unjustifiable self-indulgence on the part of the author.<br />There is also a self-conscious cleverness about the writing that is extremely annoying. One can almost see the author congratulating himself as he tweaks this particular symbolism, or that particular allusion. 'I've just likened the Ousters to heaven, and the Technocore to hell. Ain't I clever?' Or: 'marvel at how neatly I subvert the crucifix icon.'<br />What this book lacks is self-discipline. The author is so enamoured of his bold visions, that he throws them all into the book like a vegetable stew. Thebook would have been far more effective had the author resisted the temptation to overdose on originality and sacrificed some of his exotic ideas for the sake of structure and coherency.<br />This book reads more like a fantasy novel than a work of science fiction. Fantasy is a genre much more forgiving of undisciplined flights of fancy. Science fiction demands form and precision: more like to classical than to jazz.<br />It is obvious that many readers have enjoyed this novel, so I am not about to tell you that you won't. But it isn't the masterpiece that some would have you believe. It is interesting, provocative and disquieting, but at the end of the day, it leaves one feeling unfulfilled. This is a failing that exists not so much in the heart of the novel as in its mind-space, and limits its accomplishments to the level of the superficial.	2003-06-20
US	49192633	R1FDM8ZF8KFACV	0441294677	274386890	God Emperor of Dune (Dune Chronicles, Book 4)	Books	1	43	68	N	N	Suffocating Under the Weight of Pretension	This work tries to pass off muddle for sophistication. Like the academic who uses big words to intimidate the unwashed masses, Herbert cannot resist indulging in obscurity, in the hope that deficient thought and calculated confusion will be taken for deep philosophizing. This is dishonest and insulting to our intelligence. Worse, it makes for a lousy read.<br />This is not to say that one shouldn't have to sweat to grasp difficult or elusive concepts. Philosophers through the ages have expanded our minds by requiring us to think hard to understand complexity. But complexity is not obscurity. Mental effort should be called upon to reach a higher understanding, not to penetrate opaque muck that a writer exploits simply to appear clever.<br />The main theme that Herbert tries to explore is actually relatively simple: Life can only have meaning if contrasted with death and can only have value if we fear its loss. Therefore, to live fully, we cannot live securely. This is life's big and seeming contradiction; that although we hanker for the comfort of safety and order, such things lead not to vitality, but to stagnation and extinction.<br />The rest of the book is about a benevolent dictator's attempt to revitalize humanity by introducing a measured dose of disorder into the universe. Various interests oppose him because they believe that he is either evil or wrong.<br />Stated this plainly, we have the germ of an interesting and successful story. But Herbert lades this theme with so much convoluted symbolism and metaphorical baggage that it suffocates under the weight of its own pretension. As readers, we must wade through a swamp of contrived bombast and Zen-like gobbledegook to arrive at an understanding that could have been better conveyed if the writer had simply phrased it cleanly.<br />Other writers also obscure their themes for ulterior purposes. They may wish to create dramatic tension, or to pique our curiosity. Some few do so because they genuinely believe that such an exercise brings out hidden textures within their themes that a straightforward exposition will not uncover. But such artifice must never be overused or the reader will feel manipulated. In this sequel, we feel not only manipulated, but positively browbeaten.<br />Herbert's theme has been done before and done better by others. For an exquisite example of how such a theme can be explored both honestly and gracefully, try Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea Trilogy. Here, Herbert tries to be so tangential, so mystical and so clever, that he misses the target entirely.<br />No sequel of Herbert's ever came close to the brilliance of Dune. Readers should bypass all of them and stick to the original. Allow the unanswered questions of that masterpiece to stand on their own and the quality of your own imaginations to supply the answers. The result will be far superior to the contrived, pretentious and meandering bombast contained in the sequels.	2003-06-20

This is not true. This series may earn the crown for pretension, but it does not qualify as philosophical.<br />As a long-time student and admirer of philosophy, I have rarely come across so little pretending to be so much. Aside from the first Dune book, which earns its reputation justly, the rest of the series is nothing more than bafflegab posing as Deep Thought.<br />By and large, philosophy strives to clarify. It takes complicated subjects and renders them intelligible by steaming out their wrinkles. Herbert does just the opposite: he takes simple concepts and smothers them in muddle. We are invited to conclude that the Zen-like gobbledygook emanating from his characters is wisdom. But it is really nothing more than Zen-like gobbledygook. What wisdom there is could have been expressed clearly and honestly, and the result would have been a good book that rings true. What we get instead is an obvious contrivance.<br />One of my favourite professors was fond of saying, \\"Opacity is the refuge of a lazy mind\\". Never was this truer than of the various Dune sequels. \\"Opaque\\" doesn't even begin to describe them. They could reflect X-rays. Characters speak in elliptical flourishes. Sentences are terminated in mid thought. Everyone is in a constant state of confounded distress. Thoughts run in vigorous circles earnestly trying to invoke hidden profundity, but go nowhere. When a conniving underling dispenses yet another perplexing bon mot, the other characters soak it up in slack-jawed acceptance and waste ridiculous amounts of effort and time trying to puzzle it out. Why? Any self-respecting hero would simply order ...to make himself clear. And any self-respecting villain would have the discipline to keep his mouth shut without leaving hints about his deeper motivation lying all over the place ... The fact that such silliness is allowed to populate this book speaks either to the characters' vapidity, or to the writer's laziness of mind. Neither is acceptable to the integrity of the story.<br />It is time that writers stop trying to pass off obscurity as sophistication. The use of such tricks insults our intelligence and demeans the reader. It's a con, and should be recognised and condemned as such: not passed off as the product of genius.	2003-06-20

For the events in this book to take place, we must believe that, in the event of a catastrophic impact:<br />1. Millions will have the foresight to seek high ground, but our elected leaders will not.<br />2. The authorities will not take the possibility of an impact seriously, will not even make preparations for it, have no disaster management or recovery plan, and are incapable of developing or implementing such a plan after the fact.<br />3. A fragile nuclear power plant will survive an apocalyptic catastrophe intact and be worth saving, but far simpler, more numerous, and more robust coal fuelled power plants will all be utterly destroyed and not worth the effort of salvaging.<br />4. Human knowledge, custom, institutions and social cohesion are so fragile, that they will utterly disintegrate at the first major shock.<br />5. The honour, training, discipline and practically unlimited resources of the military machine are so tenuous that it will unravel into assassination, desertion and feudal fiefdom at the first opportunity.<br />6. Cannibalism is such a societal taboo that those who engage in it, even in extremis, are marked and shunned for life.<br />I could go on with episode after episode of such silliness. Additionally, such elements of interest as exist are overwhelmed by the writers' insufferable moralizing. The authors have a political agenda and do not hesitate to flog it. And, as the book's detractors have elsewhere noted, it's about as politically sensitive as Jean Marie Le Pen. Even if we make allowances for its time (1977), race is portrayed with an absurdity that defies description. The authors are by turns condescending and disdainful, disingenuous and stereotyping: Howard Stern in blackface.<br />If you are only looking for an apocalyptic adventure story, this book manages to deliver the goods, though barely and only under considerable strain. Against this, it is filled with inconsistency, absurdity and delusional flights of fancy, managing to be both childish and mean spirited. If you believe science fiction to be something more than third rate adventure stories, if you think it serves a higher calling and should reach for profounder truths, then this book is a failure.	2003-06-19

A good biographer is always aware of this and avoids the worst pitfalls by keeping himself out of the biography, thus allowing the life he is examining to stand on its own. A lousy biographer is blithely unaware of this and will inject his own prejudices and shortcomings into the biography, thus smothering the story in &quot;spin&quot;. Davidson is of the lousy sort.<br />Davidson's incessant yammering makes this biography a special form of torture. He plays everything from armchair psychoanalyst to coffee house sage. By the end, it becomes clear that this book is not about his subject matter as much as it is about himself. The life of Carl Sagan is just a convenient hook on which to hang his own politics, values and biases. There are passages where he does not even bother to conceal his scorn. There are others where bias is dressed up to look like objective analysis. It's not clear which is worse.<br />Most readers are capable of reaching their own conclusions. It is neither necessary nor desirable for a biographer to also act as a colour commentator. When such commentary is lobbed at us like mortar shells, the natural reaction is to run for cover.<br />When I picked up this book, I was hoping to form some insights into a man who had fascinated me. But I wanted to form my own insights, not have the biographer's opinions get in my face. I can decide for myself, thank you, whether Sagan was wise to choose a certain course in life, whether he was a good husband and father, whether he sacrificed his scientific integrity in his pursuit of fame. A good biographer exposes all of the wrinkles in the life he is examining: he doesn't try ironing them out for us.<br />If you are the kind of reader who can ignore the clown frantically waving on the sidelines, I suspect that you can glean some essentials about the life of Carl Sagan from the chaff that chokes this offering, and this may make the book worth a read. But if you find it difficult to filter out baloney, you will find this book a tortuous experience filled with biased innuendo, unsolicited moralizing and soapbox opera.	2002-09-26
US	49192633	R39I64207R6MWZ	006101351X	637283524	The Perfect Storm: A True Story of Men Against the Sea	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Respecting Both The Facts And The Dead	I am puzzled by the criticisms of this book decrying it's fractured narrative. Connected narrative is welcome, even necessary, in a work of fiction in which the reader expects to be immersed in an alternate world. But this writer committed himself to making his work one of fact, firmly grounded in THIS world. When an author makes such a commitment, he is not at liberty to make things up as he goes, just to keep things nicely bubbling along. Such a commitment imposes serious constraints on a writer, and Junger is to be commended for the care and self-discipline he shows in adhering to reality.<br />Take, for example, the author's approach to the severity of the sea. He could have descended into purple prose and hoped that the reader would prove kind enough to go along with him. Instead, he cuts to data buoy #44137 recording waves of 100 feet and winds of 80 miles an hour before the waves block the readings. There is something starkly menacing about the pure unadulterated facts that a more melodramatic treatment just would not convey. This also serves as the launching point into a consideration of wave dynamics. A digression from the narrative? Yes, but a worthy one, because only so can we understand that waves of 100 feet are not just twice as powerful as those of 50 feet, they are sixteen times as destructive: that swelling waves do not endanger ships, but that breaking waves kill.<br />The crew of the Andrea Gail, and the other people who lost their lives during this fateful storm, are better served by the author's commitment to fact. Their tragedy is rendered the more poignant because Junger's refusal to fictionalize them keeps them real. We cannot take refuge in the knowledge that they are just products of imagination. There but for the grace of God go I.<br />This is not a book for those looking for quick thrills or for maudlin drama. It shoulders its responsibilities seriously. It shows immense respect for the dead by its refusal to fictionalize their end. Speculation about their thoughts and deeds are left not to Hollywood hacks, but to friends or fellow fishermen: brothers and sisters under the skin who have lived through similar hells.<br />So here's the rundown. If you simply can't stand technical talk, don't read this book. If you're not fussy about the truth and prefer smooth embellishment to messy reality, don't read this book. If slick melodrama is more important to you than respect for the facts, then watch the movie instead and don't read this book. But if the storm of the century, and real heroics, and real lives hanging in the balance by a hair's breadth is sufficient drama for you, then this book will not only involve and move you; it will have you reflecting on the awful power of nature and the fragility of life for a good long time to come.	2002-09-26

It's an affectation, like lip gloss or tassels. So humdrum it's supposed to be clever.<br />Michener's books are like his titles: affectations. And for titles so pithy, his books sure are looong. They are melodramatic travelogues, trying to pass off minutiae and exotic venues for epic drama. Unfortunately, they are as laborious as a family slide show. Of interest to the travel hound, but an ordeal to the poor guest forced to endure the whole presentation. We squirm, stifle yawns and sit the thing out for courtesy's sake more than anything else.<br />This book tries to be an epic by copying the trappings of the great works. It gallops over exotic geographies and spans historical if not geological time. War and Peace in grass skirts. Its problem is that it copies the time and space of the great works while foregoing both their dramatic passion and their majestic language. Michener is a pedestrian writer, and his workmanlike phrasing just doesn't pass muster for the job that needs doing.<br />The book has its good points. It is well researched and historically accurate. It is also filled with well developed, if stereotypical characters. There is the noble savage, the chauvinistic missionary, the saintly wife, the virile entrepreneur, the Rock-of-Gibraltar peasant woman, etc. On the face of it, this book has everything it takes to be a good read: fabulous setting, sweeping plot, varied cast of characters, some worthy and significant themes.<br />What it lacks is a soul. There's nothing here that speaks to the human condition, nothing that cuts to the very nub of things. There's no point to the suffering, except as a litany to suffering itself. We are supposed to identify with the aboriginal Hawaiians, then the Chinese, then the Japanese, not because they endured and overcame, nor because their spirit shone in the darkest hour, but because they were oppressed and exploited by often wellmeaning whites. Sorry, but after the horrors of slavery, holocaust, gulags and killing fields, suffering takes on a dimension that Michener's talent is simply not equal to.<br />By diminishing the epic scale and ignoring the personal scale, Hawaii lands in the worst possible place: the middling zone of mediocrity. If the reader wishes to experience a dramatic epic of the finest sort, then try the aforementioned War and Peace, or Les Miserables. Both books tie the sweep and grandeur of an epochal time and place to the physical and spiritual struggles of one man. They give the reader a soul to cling to and, in doing so, make the suffering both personal and real. They were also written by literary geniuses up to the task of imbuing their creations with unforgettable prose, vital characters and most of all, a penetrating vision that strikes to the very heart of life; things that Hawaii does not even try to deliver.	2002-06-24

It is a convoluted maze of disconnected vignettes mixing moments of high drama with long stretches of sheer pedantry. It is also a curious jumble of epic phrasing and reference information. This must be the first book I have ever read that falls into the brand new genre of Dramatic Encyclopaedia.<br />This book probably garners its high reviews because it follows up one of the most beloved creations of the twentieth century. Lord of the Rings is the kind of writing that haunts one for life. The world of Middle Earth is so richly textured that Tolkien himself felt the need to further clarify his world through the inclusion of a series of appendices to the main story. The Silmarillion should have been another collection of appendices. Instead, it was turned into a self-conscious, puffed-up, precious tome: an accountant in epic costume.<br />I don't know about the reading public these days, but I still demand minimal standards from my books. Things like consistency, coherency, connected narrative, and clarity still matter. These are some of the things that made Lord of the Rings such a magical experience. By no means the only things, but they were indispensable, and Tolkien delivered.<br />The Silmarillion does not.<br />I struggled with this rating. As a reference work, it is an interesting addition to any Tolkien aficionado's library. But as a dramatic work, it is deplorable. Averaging out three stars and one yields two.	2002-06-24

I could never understand why. Educators either habitually underestimate the intelligence of their charges, or this series maintains its grip on the curriculum through brute inertia: it is chosen this year because it was chosen last year, and the year prior, and the year before that.<br />This series rehashes the same \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\\" malarkey that has been done to death in countless B movies and pulp novels. As a boys' adventure, it is little better than the Hardy brothers. And as introductory science fiction, it has precious little to engage the imaginations of girls, who, at last tally, accounted for roughly half the human race. Maybe this is why science fiction tends to be a disproportionately male genre. Do authors unconsciously post an \\"all girls keep out\\" sign above the door?<br />However, the book's biggest flaw is its provincialism. By keeping to its evil-aliens convention, it surrenders its birthright. It doesn't open up the larger universe of possibilities to the young mind. Things like alien vistas, epic grandeur, cosmic perspective and awe of discovery go utterly begging. This series starves the imagination, and imagination is the central element separating science fiction from other genres. I am saddened when I think of the number of young readers who must have turned away from science fiction because they concluded that this was all it had to offer.<br />Lest you think I am abusing this series because I am reading it as a jaded adult, I first read it decades ago for my own grade school reading assignment. While it introduced me to science fiction, it did nothing to interest me in the genre until I read Asimov's seminal Foundation series shortly thereafter on my own. It was this second instalment of science fiction that enthralled me. While it is somewhat unfair to compare White Mountains to one of the all-time classics of the field, it is even more unfair to allow it to stand as the genre's representative to young people. As an ambassador to the craft, this series is a poor emissary indeed.<br />This series cannot be blamed for its simplistic dialogue or its one-dimensional characters. The author set out to write a boys' adventure. But it can and should be blamed for perpetuating the \\"fear of the unknown\\" paranoia and the evil-aliens tripe that already pollutes so much of speculative fiction.

And that jarring juxtaposition between cruelty and brilliance is what makes the whole thing tick.<br />Cruelty is personified in the book's antagonist, an Army nurse who uses her position and her bureaucratic influence to sustain a reign of quiet terror on her inmates. Brilliance is embodied by the protagonist, an irascible rebel who uses his wit and sheer zest for life to instil courage and a sense of self worth in those same inmates. The contest between them is a struggle for souls. It mirrors the larger struggle we face between the spiritual death of slavish conformity and the spiritual vitality of chaotic abandon. Sometimes, to live at all, one must live madly.<br />And it is all shown to us so naturally that we never know we are learning it until we pause for reflection and thought. This is the sign of a great writer.<br />The book also has faults. For one thing, it is sexist. The women are either emotional fascists, like Ratched; or spineless, like the other nurses and Bromden's mother; or tarts, like Candy. It would have been nice to see a woman with substance and backbone as a counterpoint to the depressing figures cut by the female characters. Moreover, there is a rather misogynistic subplot hinting at Ratched's repressed sexuality and old maid syndrome as the reason for her sadism. The women are placed in positions where they lord it over the men, from the obvious to the barely perceptible, and we are vaguely made to feel that this is against the natural order of things. Kinda cheesy, and frankly, a cheap shot by the author.<br />But the book was written in 1962, before writing had become stilted and sanitized by political correctness. Perhaps it is the more honest for being what it is: a story set in a men's mental institution being run by women.<br />This book isn't really about mental institutions or old maids or the politics of the sixties or even the virtues of rebellion. It's really about power. Power to live, powerof control, power to transform and, in the end, power to escape from whatever makes us small. This theme is the skeleton. The story fleshes out the bones. In its way, it is Orwell's 1984, brought down to the level of a single institution, Big Brother replaced by Big Nurse, Winston replaced by McMurphy, and the totalitarian state replaced by the totalitarian cuckoo's nest.<br />It isn't a cheerful read. There is tragedy and loss. Some may find the book depressing. I found it inspiring. If you can step back from the characters, the setting and the plot, and look at the author's world as a coherent whole, Kesey is telling us that the Ratched's don't prevail. The cost may be painfully high, but if we are willing to pay it, we can triumph over the spiritual strangulation that Big Nurse wishes on us all.	2001-10-27

From Babylon to the Greek city-state to Ancient Rome to modern cities like Tokyo and New York, the city has epitomized progress and achievement. How subversive then to see this symbol extended to its highest utopian degree, then promptly inverted and stood on its head.<br />Clarke shows us once again why he is one of the grand masters of science fiction. Are all utopias also dystopias? Is immortality a truly desirable goal? Is security worth the sacrifice of curiosity? In achieving paradise, do we surrender our humanity?<br />These are large questions that this book answers provocatively and incompletely, itself a tribute to the author's good sense. Too complete an answer would not only be pedantic, it would deprive us of the pleasure of our own ruminations.<br />His detractors will cite his usual shortcomings: flat characters, slow plots, pedestrian imagery and merely adequate writing. While true, such complaints miss the point because Clarke has never pretended to great literature. His purpose is to provoke: with the facility of his intelligence, the depth of his creativity, the breadth of his imagination. Expecting depth of character from Clarke is just as misplaced as expecting alien planetary vistas from Shakespeare. Such expectations say more about the limitations of the reader than those of the author.<br />The City and the Stars was written years before the dark urban vistas of Dick and Gibson. If others have constructed more compelling visions of futuristic dystopias, it is because they have had the benefit of standing on Clarke's shoulders. But even in the venue of dystopias, Clarke's questions go beyond the merely dystopian. He isn't interested in obvious dystopias; he wants to explore the underpinnings of utopias that are not what they seem. In this respect, only Huxley comes to mind as someone who trod the same path, and Huxley was too cynical a writer to allow us much room for our ownreflections.<br />While not in the same league as 2001, Childhood's End or Rama, this is a very worthwhile read from a uniquely inventive writer. The book is enjoyable and thought provoking and far better than the vast majority of science fiction from lesser authors.	2001-10-24
US	49192633	R3CGNLPG6UY0PK	0345322401	193021593	The Songs of Distant Earth	Books	2	18	22	N	N	Intimate, but slow and uninspiring	This is one of Clarke's quieter stories. It's a chamber piece rather than a symphony. And because he aims for intimacy and muted volume over grandeur, it doesn't have the sweep of his best work.<br />It tells the story of a society of humans, transplanted from a dying earth, who are visited by a starship of later generation humans also fleeing destruction. In terms of plot, that's really about it. The rest of the story is a relaxed reflection on the consequences of such a meeting. In almost every way, it rehashes themes that Clarke has explored before. The utopian existence of a self satisfied, slightly stagnant society shaken by the arrival of strangers was explored in various stories, but especially The City and the Stars. The evolution of life in a watery environment was covered in 2010. Unattached sex and atheism are to be found in practically all of his works. And a ship full of hibernating passengers on a long and distant journey was used first on 2001 and then on Rama.<br />The trouble with this book is that it suffers in comparison with those other works. If it had come earlier in his career, it could at least have claimed the distinction of originality. But themes so much better presented elsewhere gives this book the feel of a used hand-me-down. It is interesting, in a quaint sort of way, but does not arrest us with the sheer power of revelation that we have come to expect from Clarke's best.<br />This is a work I would only recommend to his most die-hard fans. But even such fans will find the pace slow and the story uninspiring. I sense what he has tried to do here, which is to depart from his usual exploration of vast themes and come closer to the human dimension. But he has always been weak with his character development and he doesn't play the introspection card at all well. Clarke is out of his element here. Intentions are not enough, and marks earned for trying are lost again to mediocrity.	2001-10-24

This sequel is brutally bad. It is worse than bad. It is a betrayal.<br />If Rendezvous With Rama is the high point in Clarke's career, then this sequel is most certainly his nadir. It sacrifices everything that makes its progenitor such a classic. The mystery and inspiration of the Ramans are turned into a cheap stage prop for an episode of Survivor. We are treated to the Roman spectacle of a bunch of worthless misfits, each conniving to remain the last one standing. We neither know nor care about their fate. Halfway through, I found myself praying that the Ramans would just show up and ray the lot of them.<br />To understand how bad this novel really is, one must understand why the original is so good.<br />The best science fiction gives us something no other genre can: a cosmic perspective that is vastly greater than the merely human. In offering this, it teaches us valuable lessons like humility, tolerance and understanding. And it teaches us these things not at the personal level, but at the universal one. For example, suppose we meet an alien species that is nobler than we. Nobler in every way and in every detail. In art, science, philosophy, morality. What if, due to some cosmic calamity, only one race could survive? Should it be the alien's or ours? Is there a higher cosmic ethic than survival of our species?<br />This is just a poor approximation to the kinds of reflections that good science fiction can provoke; yet it gives you a sense of the thoughts that the original novel stirred. Such a book cleaves to your heart and to your mind and just won't let go.<br />Now, take this theme and trivialise it. Consider instead a supermodel who is prettier than we. Prettier in every way and in every detail. In hair, shape, flounce and pout. What if, due to some catering disaster, only one of us could enter the pageant? Should it be the supermodel or we? Is there a higher standard of display appeal than that of the runway?<br />My analogy may sound like a caricature, but it is not. The trivialisation that occurs in Rama 2 is exactly of the kind that I have expounded. We go from contemplating the majesty of the cosmos to wallowing in the pettiness of twits.<br />It is no good pretending that this travesty is not the work of Clarke; that it is Gentry Lee's fault. Mr. Clarke has a duty to defend the integrity of his visions. By putting his name to trash, he implicitly if not explicitly participates in the destruction of what is magnificent. Avoid this sequel like a case of herpes. It will do nothing but destroy whatever mystery and intelligent reflection as made the first book so sublime.	2001-10-23
US	49192633	R33D6033NCYOP	0691023808	246272576	The New Science of Strong Materials or Why You Don't Fall Through the Floor	Books	5	32	32	N	N	Elegant, Simple and Fascinating	Professor Gordon is the sort of teacher I would have appreciated in school. One imagines him as a grey haired gentleman in rumpled slacks and cardigan with a pipe and sneakers who makes it his kindly mission in life to fill his students with a zest for his chosen calling.<br />His explanations are elegant, simple and fascinating. I can't think of higher praise for someone trying to make sense of a discipline as complicated as materials science.<br />The problem with most academics is an inherent need to appear learned. This leads to obscure and convoluted explanations that are, if not overtly, at least subconsciously designed to maintain the gap between the ignorant masses and the enlightened adepts. Even when such academics make a conscious attempt to simplify, their efforts are too often sabotaged by the bad habits of a lifetime.<br />This is why good popularisers are so difficult to come by, and why the Gordons of the world should be so prized.<br />This book isn't just about the science of materials, but about how such an exotic subject actually connects with our everyday lives. We live in a certain way, and not in a different way, because of the strengths, weaknesses, costs and working difficulties in the materials that we use. I don't think most laymen ever bother thinking about the world in quite this way.<br />This book is not actually meant for engineers or scientists, although most such technos would greatly benefit from reading it (if only to learn the meaning of true grasp and clarity). Its true benefit is to those curious laymen who wish to know more, but who find the usual explanations beyond them.<br />This book should be required reading for all undergraduates, not just aspiring scientists or engineers. In fact, it should be especially required for non-technical types.	2001-10-23
US	49192633	RA6NMBHC0FS25	0553287893	458314472	Rendezvous with Rama	Books	5	4	5	N	N	A Grandmaster's Best	Of all his works, this is my favourite. The story of Rama is told with something that Clarke rarely displays in even his best work: that ineffable quality that the French call élan.<br />Some of his novels are given to large themes, like the fate of humanity in Childhood's End. Other works excel in the small, like the technological miracles making up everyday life in The City and the Stars. But in this work, both large and small matters are treated equally: with an imaginative scope that defies comparison.<br />This is the story about a first alien encounter that Steven Spielberg could only wish he had created. Unlike Close Encounters, this story does not feign significance through flashing lights or latex prosthetics. The aliens are so much more interesting for remaining mysterious. It is an exquisite balancing act of startling revelations and teasing mystery.<br />The story is constructed like an onion. An alien ship is detected entering our solar system and an opportune survey ship is dispatched to investigate. The crew enter the starship and uncover its secrets layer after splendid layer. Every chapter springs a surprise; but they are not the cheap surprises of a dime novel. They are, instead, dazzling surprises; like the first time you learned that your uncle was a Nobel laureate; that he was one of a set of twins; that the other won a Pulitzer; that to this day, dad keeps it in the same drawer as his socks.<br />Some reviewers will disparage this work for its shallow characters and its insipid prose. Such criticism is accurate, but it is also silly and beside the point. Expecting deep characters and Shakespearean phrasing from Clarke is like expecting a symphonic work from the Rolling Stones. Clarke isn't setting out to write literature. He is writing speculative fiction, the essence of which remains the one overriding commandment: \\"above all else, the imagination must shine\\". In this work, Clarke's imagination shines as never before.<br />The most striking thing about this book is how consistently creative it is. Most authors find a single creative vein, stake a claim to it, then spend the remainder of the novel working it for all it is worth. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this. After all, creativity is precious and rare, and when one hits upon an especially rich vein, one cannot be blamed for mining it. Nonetheless, in Rama, Clarke opens up new veins in practically every chapter. As readers, we are not dependent on one theme to carry the novel, but are privy to a wealth of material that continually overwhelms us with awe.<br />Nor is anything left unresolved. All elements are directed at bringing the whole novel to fruition, but in a way that is not neat, not tidy, not contrived. The ending leaves endless scope for our own speculations and is all the more satisfying for doing so.<br />Like his other great work, 2001, Clarke creates a brilliant stand-alone masterpiece. However, the sequels are simply brutal. This is one of those books that should be treated with finality. It won the Hugo, Nebula and Campbell awards and deserves every one of them. If you own a copy of this book, don't make the mistake of lending it. You'll never see it again.	2001-10-23

It is actually a human story of great power that uses science merely as a means to explore themes like pain and loss, alienation, society's prejudice for intelligence, and our innate fear of mental deterioration.<br />Throughout this work, the author must improvise. Consider what he has to overcome. Keyes is telling, in the first person, the story of a mentally retarded man, and he must convey his character's universe to readers who, by virtue of being readers, are far from retarded. The author also has to bring his character through an immense intellectual range, from a barely functional literacy to a genius level mind, and he has to do so not only incrementally, but honestly and believably. There are many other nuances that Keyes handles deftly, but the two already mentioned would sink the average author as he leaves dry dock.<br />We all remember the bell shaped grade school plot diagram - the one wherein Mrs. Frump shows us the story starting at the bottom, rising to its climax, then down again to some strange French province called the &quot;dénouement&quot;. Almost every story we have since read has conformed to this plot design. But how many stories apply this curve not to the plot, but to its central character?<br />This is the secret to Keyes's achievement. We are invited into Charlie Gordon's mind and our sense of his world expands as his mind expands, until we can't tell if the quickening pace of the thoughts are Charlie's or our own. What a wonderful device. It seems unfair to even call it a &quot;device&quot; - as if it were something the author uses to con us. Add to this Charlie's emotional journey, and the story grips with rare poignancy.<br />There is one stipulation. To live and breathe as Charlie, one must be willing to accept the book's device, immerse oneself in its first person perspective, and go along for the ride. Readers who approach their reading with a reserved detachment will find this book manipulative. It IS manipulative, but in the way that all good fiction is: the author is guiding us to undiscovered country.<br />The author never pummels his message nor engages in easy sentimentality. If you are the sort of reader who can chip off your encrusted cynicism for an afternoon and let Charlie Gordon in under your skin, you will appreciate this story as one of still reflection and quiet pity. It will give you a fuller appreciation for your own life.<br />As a postscript, a film titled &quot;Charly&quot; was made based on this novel starring Cliff Robertson in the named role. Robertson won an Oscar for his portrayal of the central character. In its abridged way, this film is almost as good as the book, and gives a different slant to Charlie's life.	2001-10-23
US	49192633	R2A1TXP9C3V67D	0345342968	383457570	Fahrenheit 451	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A thinker's treasure, but not for the shallow of mind	We all hold some novels so close to our hearts that we cannot view them dispassionately. For me, one such treasure is Fahrenheit 451. This is the novel that first awakened me to the possibility that science fiction could be about more than just action heroes, quick thrills and mindless drivel: that at its best, it honours a unique literary duty, allowing us to glimpse horrific futures that may actually come to pass if we leave the path of wisdom.<br />Fahrenheit 451 is one of the finest examples of that sub genre of science fiction called dystopian fiction. Every science fiction writer of note has drawn from this well, but few as successfully as Bradbury. The only other authors to realise equal successes are Orwell with 1984 and Huxley with Brave New World. Some would add Gibson and Dick, but theirs are derivative works of a later generation. Of all such works, Bradburys is the most accessible. At his centre, Bradbury is an optimist while the others are not. Consequently, Fahrenheit 451 holds out the light of hope when the others leave us despairing.<br />This book operates on countless levels. It can be read as a futuristic fable, a psychological drama, or a social commentary. It is a rich character study; a pounding plot-driven quest; an overwhelming thematic work, or a setting of sterile horror. In actuality, it is all of this and more. Rarely does one happen upon a work in which the parts fit together so exquisitely, and for this reason alone, it deserves its reputation as one of the greatest works in the genre.<br />But it is the characters that make this book come alive. When the protagonist experiences the emptiness of a hollow life, the anguish of guilt, the glimmerings of a real love, the terror of blind panic or the despair of pursuit, it is as if these things are happening to us. Bradburys skill transforms science fiction into literature.<br />This is not a book for juvenile minds. While it is written in tight, almost Spartan prose, and reads like achildrens novel, it is actually a highly philosophical work. In some ways palpable, but in more ways subtle, it focuses an unflinching light on those ugly aspects of our nature that impel us towards superficiality and mental sloth. It is no wonder that shallow readers and idle thinkers find this book unrewarding and depressing; even vaguely insulting. More thoughtful readers will be disturbed, but that will only be to Bradburys purpose.<br />This work is really written for brave thinkers - those willing to confront unpleasantness and sweat for their rewards. Such readers, no matter what their age, will fall in love with this book. Bradbury exposes the failings of our natures with a perception and a depth of wisdom that few science fiction authors can reach. Most of all, his love for humanity shines through the darkness of his cautionary tale: and he has the literary courage to warn us against ourselves without the addition of artificial sweetener.	2001-10-04

As a stand-alone novel, it actually has considerable merit. Clarke still shows a powerful and provocative imagination, and the events that unfold still manage to fill us with wonder. However, this is achieved at the cost of demolishing other, more central wonders, for no better reason than to service the plot.<br />2001 was a supremely intelligent work. I don't mean that it was written in intelligent sounding phrases or possessed the convolutions that pass for intelligence among the sophisticated. I mean that it respected our intelligence. It gave us room to reach our own conclusions. It never channelled our thinking along furrows already ploughed into the mental landscape. The most important skill that a writer can cultivate is to reveal just enough to provoke thought, but to respect the reader enough to leave the actual thinking to us.<br />Therefore, the star-child's actions were left for us to interpret. The reason behind HAL's mutiny was left to our imagination. The nature of the mentor race was left to our own speculation. Most importantly, the ways in which humanity would change in the wake of the star-child's awakening were left to our own musings. We were left with a sense of awe and something akin to a spiritual awakening. Would we become a better race? Would we leave our earthly cradle and join a cosmic community? Would our focus change from an ingrown provincialism to an outreaching cosmopolitanism? For that matter, did the star-child rid the world of its orbiting nuclear weapons to give the human race a fresh chance, or did it destroy humanity because we were beyond redemption?<br />This is the essence of good science fiction: to leave us with lingering reflections long after the final chapter is finished. How discouraging then, to have the mysteries laid bare, and our own reflections directed along the confines of some dried up mental riverbed. 2010, for all itscleverness, punctures our imaginings. The star-child turns out to be a mediocre messenger boy, the progenitor race is arrogant and aloof, and humanity doesn't change at all.<br />Certainly, there are other imaginative developments to replace these, but do they really belong in the universe of the original work? The developments in 2010 could easily have been written for an independent novel and the result would still have been pure Clarke. Here, the wonder of the present work is achieved by destroying the wonder of the earlier work, and this is a bad trade.<br />If you don't care about the earlier novel, you won't be disappointed by the developments in this one. The plot, themes and imagination are all up to Clarke's usual standards. But if you are like me, you will find the reading experience greatly diminished by the realisation that these achievements were made at the expense of a higher and more inspiring vision.	2001-09-30
US	49192633	R34CU33KMTYEAN	0441172695	445283043	Dune Messiah (The Dune Chronicles, Book 2)	Books	2	15	19	N	N	Unattractive sequel to a brilliant progenitor	Some books should never beget sequels. They are so perfect that any attempt to serialise them will only succeed in making the sequels look bad. Dune is such a book, and the sequels all meet their destinies by indeed looking bad. Some critics have even suggested that Herbert wrote the sequels only to cash in on the popularity of the original. This is uncharitable. Herbert wrote the sequels because he believed that he had important things to say. The problem is that he throws out most of what made the progenitor so good in order to say his Important Things.<br />Nor does it help that those Important Things don't turn out to be too important. Crusade as a cleansing social/moral force; the psychoanalysis of prophesy; the pitfalls of omniscience; all are themes that have been explored more deeply and more cohesively by other writers.<br />Moreover, such themes are out of place in the world of Dune. Dune was effective because it was simple. The Fremen commanded our interest because their outlook on life was as stark as their environment. Jessica commanded our sympathy because she chose her loyalty as consort and mother over her instilled training as social engineer. Paul commanded our respect because he continually overcame adversity, displayed courageous resourcefulness and showed himself in every way his father's son. These are all characteristics with which we can identify because they satisfy our yearning for love, honour and justice. And in Dune, Herbert successfully elevated them from the commonplace to the heroic by keeping them free of unnecessary artifice.<br />In Messiah, Herbert forgets this principle and overindulges in cleverness. Every character has inscrutable agendas, unfathomable layers, infinite subtlety. Such properties must be used sparingly. When they are slathered on with a trowel, as they are here, they only succeed in turning the characters into caricatures of themselves. I was nauseous after the umpteenth description of such and such a verbal blade unerringly penetrating to such and such a depth because it was precisely engineered with such and such a sub-harmonic and delivered with exactly such and such a sneer. Ohh Puhlease!<br />This is an unattractive work and the sequels that follow only get worse. But when a writer composes a masterpiece as fine as Dune, I suppose he can be forgiven his later excesses.	2001-09-28
US	49192633	R2WIVYEIPPNPU8	0553293354	834333861	Foundation	Books	5	1	2	N	N	&quot;Classic&quot; is an understatement	I liked Star Wars. But for those of us who knew and loved the Foundation trilogy as one of the greatest masterpieces in all of science fictiondom, it was galling to hear the misplaced accolades heaped on the movie lauding its originality.<br />Asimov's seminal universe was created decades before Lucas's derivative one, and Lucas shamelessly lifted whole passages of ideas, themes and settings from Asimov. The idea of a galactic empire; the conflict between an established empire and a fledgling but vital upstart; a world-girdling city at the heart of galactic government; a noble elite with incredible mental powers; a mysterious antagonist possessing the same mental powers but directed towards dark conquest; even the robots are there (albeit from a different Asimov source).<br />I mention these things not to disparage Star Wars but to elevate Asimov. Today, it is too easy to forget just how original and inspiring the Foundation trilogy was when it first appeared in print. In the intervening decades, lesser imitators have copied, twisted and diluted the original story so often that its brilliance has been buried under mountains of mediocre muck.<br />This trilogy has so much going for it that it is hard to know where to begin. For one thing, it is tautly written. Asimov would tend towards bombast later in life, but not here. For another, it sustains bold visions and landscapes of truly cosmic proportions. It also strikes the right note in setting the lives of a group of protagonists against a backdrop of immense historical forces. In so doing, it attains the weight of epic.<br />Mostly, it astounds us with the sheer power of its imagination. I have already alluded to its many firsts, but it is what Asimov does with these firsts - the subtle way he folds them into the very substance of his story - that distinguishes this work. Take the theme of psychohistory. Asimov coined this term for his premise that all of human behaviour is reducible to a complex set of mathematicalequations. He translates this abstraction into a storyline that is so compelling that we never think to question the outlandishness of his premise.<br />This is science fiction at its finest: the marriage of science with fiction, all done with such consummate skill - the one merging so seamlessly into the other - that we are never aware of where the one ends and the other begins. Do not pass up the opportunity to read this trilogy. In the science fiction universe, it is the work of a grand master at the height of his calling.	2001-09-26

The central and critical theme in the film came from \\"The Sentinel\\" a story that Clarke wrote long before Kubrick's involvement. Consequently, the film was built on a secure literary foundation and the concurrent novel could be sourced upon the muse of writers and not that of directors.<br />The other secret to the novel's success is Clarke. A lesser author would have floundered. But Clarke is one of the grand masters of the genre and, in addition to the prodigious intellect and creative powers that he could bring to bear, his reputation allowed him the freedom to depart from the film's script and impose his own vision on the novel. The result is a book with enough differences from the film that it can be separated from its twin sibling and judged on its own merits. This is especially important when we consider how large an effect the film has had on the genre's psyche.<br />So many superlatives have been heaped upon this work, that there is nothing to be gained in further praising it. More useful then, is defining who will not like it.<br />Those who wish their thinking done for them will not like this book. It asks too many difficult questions and has the temerity to leave them unanswered. It even implies that some questions can have no answers. Some people will find that this messes with their minds to a totally unacceptable degree. Likewise, it will not appeal to action junkies. The pace of the book reflects something of reality. For example, the journey to Saturn is described in much the way such a journey might feel - leisurely and methodically, with the crisis arising at the end and not a series of emergencies manufactured just to pump up the plot. The descriptions of astronaut routine are fascinating, but only to those who have cultivated a sense of patience. Those with the attention span of a flea will find this book boring.<br />Most of all, this book won't appeal to those who want comfort: whether the comfort of formula, the boundaries of the purely human, or the reassurance of what is already known. This novel has earned its reputation because it seeks to expand our minds, beyond the human and into the unknown. There is absolutely nothing formulaic about it.<br />The only beef I have with Clarke is that he didn't leave well enough alone. None of the sequels remotely approach the quality of the original and some of the subsequent explanations destroy much of the mystery that made 2001 so unique.	2001-09-26
US	49192633	R2GCZJRTRCVPDM	0441172717	88529599	Dune	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A &quot;masterpiece&quot; deserving of the claim	There is no praise that can be sung about this book that has not already been sung. When it was first published in 1965, it burst upon the science fiction scene like a supernova. Nothing had ever been written that was even remotely similar. Reviewers coined new phrases to describe the novel: space feudalism, feudal-futurism, even sand fiction. Yet, anyone who has read the novel can attest to the poverty of such labels. This is a book that defies pigeonholing.<br />Where shall I start? Firstly, unlike so much in science fiction, even by grand masters like Asimov and Clarke, this book develops characters of exceptional depth. They each have such vibrant inner lives that it is impossible not to identify with them. The writing is absolutely first class. Spare, tight, exquisitely metaphorical, not a word wasted, its a pleasure to read. The imagery is so effective you can feel the grit of sand in your teeth. Then there is the sheer genius of Herberts imagination. He borrows from history the religious and feudal societies, but transform them into something unique and original.<br />This is one of the most complete science fiction classics ever written. Whether it is writing skill, plot, themes, setting, characterizations, breadth of imagination or sheer weight of ingenuity, it beggars parallel. I cant think of a single fault, except perhaps that it had to come to an end.<br />The only unfortunate aspect of this work was that it scaled pinnacles of such extraordinary height that Herbert would never attain them again. Each of his sequels fell further and further from the mark set by this novel, and some of his later works were simply embarrassing.<br />Beg, borrow or steal this book. Just dont pass up the chance to read it.	2001-09-26

Some of the best parts of that book were the questions it left unanswered. What did the star-child actually do? Why did HAL mutiny? What is the nature of the progenitor civilization?<br />All good fiction shares this one virtue: it allows the reader a private mental space. Our imaginations are given room to breath and we are afforded the opportunity to reach our own conclusions because enough of a resolution is provided to complete the story, but no more. Too much exposition fences in a universe that must remain, if it is to compel us, both expansive and elusive.<br />2001 also dealt successfully with big themes: humanity's place in the universe, the nature of sentient thought, the definition of life, moral judgment in a machine.<br />These are all elements that are missing from 3001. An astronaut is resurrected who should have remained dead. A society is exposited that is fundamentally no different from ours. This is a poor resolution, especially after an event as momentous as the emergence of the star-child. It's all terribly anti-climactic. It's as though we were given a thorough and detailed exposition of Odysseus' retirement after his great struggles. Enjoyable for Odysseus perhaps, and certainly well deserved, but hardly the compelling stuff of epic, and of no interest to posterity.<br />Blandness is the great pitfall of science fiction. Plot, character, setting, themes, even the quality of the writing can be second rate, but the imagination must scintillate. In 3001, the imagination plods and Clarke tries to make up for its absence with a series of vignettes that make no new contributions to the human story. We end up with a work that is too clever by half and too comfortable by far. All in all, one of Clarke's weakest contributions within a lifetime omnibus of the highest achievement.	2001-09-26

Le Guin will come into her own with the Earthsea trilogy and earn pre-eminence with The Left Hand of Darkness. But here, in her first efforts, we can see the developing touch--the sure hand and the restrained voice already at work.<br />The City of Illusions is the last of a loose trilogy of works that the author calls the \\"Three Hainish Novels\\". Set in the same Hainish universe as two earlier works, this novel shares little with its predecessors, except for a hazy reference to a collective history and the common device of telepathy.<br />Still, it is pure Le Guin. The author likes large themes - in this case, truth, falsehood, and the crisis of identity. The protagonist is on a journey, both figuratively and literally, to find his true being - not just his being, but his true being - a subtle but important difference. When we are introduced to him, he is a blank with no identity and no past. He must painfully build a new identity from nothing; burdened with the belief that a previous lifetime has been erased. In searching for that past, he is forced to face the fear of a false self; a life based on a lie.<br />Such a psychological drama could have sunken into contrivance but for the skill of the author. Le Guin navigates this hazard by making the anguish of the protagonist real and immediate, and she avoids manipulation by revealing rather than directing.<br />Yet, for all the written skill, this novel does not fulfill its potential. It is unsatisfying - not severely, but enough to diminish the reading experience. For one thing, the plot is incomplete: it needs an epilogue to sate our curiosity. It is also incomplete in a more vital and thematic sense: a large need is filled in a small way. When the human race is enslaved to aliens, what significance can we attach to the fleeting freedom of one man? The weight is all off kilter. The final passage ends on a note of hope, but is insufficient to redress the imbalance.<br />Though better than most science fiction, this book remains uneven. The austerity of the writing is cool and bracing; but the ideas lack expansiveness and the story lacks a resolution. While reading it, we set aside the immediate for the promise of things to come; but when that promise goes begging, we are so flustered by its unexpected absence that we lose sight of the vibrancy in the present. This book appeals more to stylists; less to seekers after an organic whole.	2001-09-17

Like the old friend who doesn't know when to quit the party, this sequel has overstayed its welcome. Producing one-sequel-too-many seems to be an occupational hazard that strikes many writers of popular fiction, but it especially afflicts authors of science fiction. Herbert should have stopped after his first Dune novel. Clarke should never have added any further digits to 2001. And Asimov, who created what is arguably the best trilogy in the genre, should never have produced the dish-watery addendums that have made up each of the sequels to the three masterful originals.<br />The original Foundation trilogy worked in part because it struck the right balance between exposition and mystique. As the founder of psychohistory (one of the most inventive creative achievements in the SF genre), Hari Seldon may have been no more than a man, but Asimov wisely invested him with an almost mythical allure. This mystique was derived by maintaining a certain distance between the reader and the character, a remoteness that was necessary to sustaining the enormity of the books' setting. In making Seldon a larger than life figure, Asimov produced an archetype: a personification of knowledge; a symbol of intellectual potency; a prophet for the totality of human history. It is unwise to flesh such a figure out too fully. By limiting our knowledge, Asimov frees our imaginations to impart an element of majesty to the archetype that a more detailed exposition would only have destroyed.<br />In this book, and in each of the subsequent sequels, Asimov makes the mistake of demystifying Seldon. In so doing, he demystifies the universe that he so painstakingly created. We can no longer lose ourselves in the vast historical sweep of a galactic empire. Instead, our attention is diverted from the large drama of its collapse to the small drama of one man's struggle. In losing the mystique, we also lose the wonder.<br />To be sure, in the hands of a literary genius, stories setting off the life ofa single individual against a backdrop of immense historical forces can be very compelling. But Asimov is no Hugo or Tolstoy. As a writer, his strengths are not to be found in his characterizations, his finesse, or in his facility with high drama. Like all great science fiction writers, Asimov's primary strength is his imagination. A galactic empire; a planet-straddling galactic capital; human behaviour reducible to mathematical laws; mental manipulation of emotions; the delicate balance of the human mind; the empathic relationship between the individual and the group; these are the themes that show him in the best light. When he sticks to them, as he does in the original trilogy, he invents a future that is overwhelming in its texture and its scope. When he departs from them, as he does here, the shallowness of his characters doom us to a disappointing stroll through the merely mediocre.	2001-06-26

Or more accurately, it is not merely or even primarily about humanity. This story evokes its strong reactions because, at its core, it is really about the universe. It transcends the cares and concerns of humanity and asks us to consider the cosmic perspective. Therein lies its power. Step by step, we come to understand that the story of humanity is actually only one thread within a huge and truly awesome canvass.<br />Childhood's End may be one of Clarke's earliest novels, but it is by no means immature. In many ways, it is his most ambitious project. While many of his future novels will force us to view humanity in a context that greatly exceeds our conventional perspectives, he will never again force upon us a perspective as vast as this. Those who interpret it as pessimistic are wrong. Clarke's vision is too large to be confined to purely human terms like optimism or pessimism. In its final pages, we are caught up in something so momentous that to apply human concerns to it seems pedestrian and provincial.<br />Clarke's writing will never qualify as great literature. His characters tend towards the static and the flat. In all of his writings, there isn't a single protagonist who is burdened with the angst or the inner conflict that defines the most memorable characters in the classics. He cannot reach the depth that, say, a Joyce or a Dostoyevsky can. In 2001 A Space Odyssey, far and away the most interesting character is a sentient computer. Similarly, Clarke's themes, while entirely worthy, offer no fundamentally novel insights into human nature. His plots are interesting, but don't keep us up nights turning the pages.<br />Clarke's genius lies not in the strength of his writing but in the depth of his imagination. In general, Science Fiction is distinguished from other genres primarily in the depth and breadth of its imagination and Clarke is one of its Grand Masters. He is at his best describing other worlds so exotic and astounding that one can't decide whether the greater marvel is his imaginings or the fact of his imagining them. This is very evident in his description of the dreams of the super-child, dreams that are, quite literally, otherworldly. And the ending itself comprises one of the most imaginative exercises in the genre.<br />All good writing challenges one to think outside oneself. But for me, Childhood's End is a masterpiece because it challenges one to think outside all of humanity. We are reminded that the universe is comprised of more than just bipedal water-based oxygen-catalysing meat. Clarke goes beyond the grandeur of the human spirit to encompass the grandeur of the universe.	2001-06-26

In the land of Earthsea, magic is inexorably tied to the true name of a thing. Potential, in and of itself, can do nothing without knowledge. It is the two together that enable magic. Wizards spend their lives learning true names, without which, they can only perform charms and tricks.<br />This book is a magnificent piece of literary art. It works on so many levels that one can only marvel at the facility with which disparate pieces of such varying sizes and shapes are moulded into a coherent whole. The result is a masterpiece.<br />One level is dedicated to children. It is an adventure story of inner courage and strength of character. Another level is dedicated to young adults. It is a story of a boy's journey into manhood and the conquest of self-limitation. The deepest level is also the most mature. It is a philosophical rumination on the balance of life.<br />There is more than the one type of magic here - the author submerges her themes into the story so naturally, that one is never aware of her literary magic at work. For example, she does not stretch for the philosophical. She eases into it, without hurry or seeming care. It is only afterward that one becomes aware of having experienced something profound.<br />Another sample; this one a taste of the writer's lyricism: &quot;But Ged went on, falcon-winged, falcon-mad, like an unfalling arrow, like an unforgotten thought, over the Osskil Sea and eastward into the wind of winter and the night.&quot; The gift for vivid similes, the cadence of the sentence, the sheer potency in the words, all combine to weave a literary spell that surpasses any magic present in the story. This is a great gift, and not even the greatest.<br />The greatest gift that this or any writer can give to her reader is that of self-discovery. In this work, as in each of the subsequent two,Le Guin crafts such a discovery so perfectly, that her work is elevated into literature. This is one of those books that change lives. Had she written nothing else, the world would owe Ursula K. Le Guin an immeasurable debt of gratitude for writing just this one.	2000-11-29
US	49192633	R35ZR86RFAJKL6	0937986860	776280377	The Hour of the Dragon	Books	5	7	8	N	N	In-your-face adventure with an attitude	In this age of unrelenting political correctness, it is risky confessing to a liking for Conan. The character has few redeeming qualities. He slays and steals without compunction, is indifferent towards the suffering of others, is avaricious and selfish, contemptuous of weakness and authority, and conceited in his physical strength. His code of honour, such as it is, consists mainly of a rough honour towards women. This just means that he doesn't bed them unless they are willing. That Howard's females are invariably ditzy bimbos who throw themselves at the hero's feet makes this code less onerous than it might otherwise seem.<br />Howard's writing is filled with violence, sexism, racism and misology. It is writing that wallows in gore, oversimplifies conflict and is unabashedly unrepentant about its swaggering macho creed.<br />But god, what writing it is.<br />The man writes like an angel, some would say a devil; but irrespective of political stripe, one cannot but concede that he writes well. His world is intense; the colours more vibrant, the sights sharper, the smells stronger than anything we have a right to expect. We are not just invited, but compelled to leave our civilised selves behind and become immersed in a barbaric world of hard men, soft women and nerve wracking adventure.<br />And it's all a game. The violence, the racism and the sexism are disarmed by the fact that the writing is completely without pretension. Howard does not seek to plumb deep waters or unveil hidden truths. He only wishes to tell a good yarn. Monsters, demons, wizards and nubile wenches all succumb to this simple-minded epitome of raging testosterone so that we can lay aside our own pretensions for a while and indulge the primitive side of our nature. There's no message, no complex themes, no agenda. Faulting Conan for his paper-thin persona is like faulting Mickey Mouse, or Paul Bunyan for the same. They are all cartoon characters, larger than life, but much shallower too, representing one simple and very narrow aspect of existence taken to its extreme.<br />To appreciate this character properly, one cannot take oneself too seriously. Readers who can't stand anything less than Austin or Joyce should stay away. There is absolutely nothing refined, sensitive or intellectual about Conan the Barbarian.<br />Incidentally, the Conan franchise practically gave birth to the sword-and-sorcery fantasy epic. It eventually evolved into a host of derivative works, some written by gifted and famous authors. But I have yet to come across a derivation that matches Howard's originals. In breadth of imagination and sheer writing skill, Howard is without equal. I own copies of all his work but most are now out of print. If you run across one in a used bookstore, buy it, and be prepared to spend a sleepless night in demon haunted crypts battling crazed monsters and power mad wizards.	2000-11-29

In so doing, the author takes a chance. Because the thesis is central to the entire series and is revisited here for the second time, she invites comparison with what has gone before. Other writers who have so dared have stumbled. This writer is sure footed. She produces a glorious work of immeasurable grace and beauty - a jewel of the writers' art.<br />As with all her works, Le Guin writes with an exquisitely literate style. Dramatic but not theatrical, spare but not severe, eloquent but not ephemeral, every word and sentence is framed with obvious love and care. This is a writer who respects our intelligence and challenges us with her wisdom. We have no choice but to respond to her in kind.<br />This book is an exploration of the balance of life. A thesis of such scope always risks pretension, and in the hands of a lesser writer, such pretension would have been unavoidable. But Le Guin is one of the best authors of our time. She avoids pitfalls with a deftness that can only leave one filled with quiet admiration. In this work, she not only avoids pretension, but subsumes her thesis in an adventure of such vitality that the world of Earthsea remains firmly embedded in our consciousness long after we are finished.<br />There are so many levels at work in this story that this short review does not have the room to list them. Literary types will find enough symbolism, metaphor and literary allusion to keep them occupied and content for weeks. But the story is not about technique. Le Guin is foremost a reader's author. She has a story to tell, a question to ask, and an answer for us to consider. Her technique, as wonderful as it is, is a by-product of her genius, and as such, it is a bonus. For those who appreciate such skill, the technique adds to her story, but it never distracts us from her goal: the creation of a magical world in which the larger questions of life can be explored bravely and sincerely.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone without reservation. Young people may not understand the deeper themes; but for them, there is enough plot, characterization and action to enthral. Mature readers will find here a work that treats the large issues of life with dignity, compassion and an uncommon intelligence. Altogether, it is a fitting final movement to a perfect symphony.	2000-11-29

This author not only brings it off, but does so in a way that feels just right. We allow her four chapters to set the stage because it is time well spent. She does not waste a single thought.<br />Hers is a quiet and unhurried voice, but also cleanly intelligent. She writes sparingly, allowing the reader to fill in the spaces. In so doing, she makes room for wisdom.<br />The first book in this story was about the balance of life. This one is about identity. It features two protagonists: the mage already mentioned, and a young girl whose identity is ceded and then regained. I am giving away some of the plot, but this is not a betrayal. This story is about so many things, least of all plot.<br />How many works of fantasy depict a magic that is boastful? The magic in them is like fireworks - all thunder, flash and vigorous action. Here, the author chances another approach: her magic is so subtle that it almost escapes notice. It is used to quiet great powers, conceal a desperate escape, forestall a mounting cataclysm. This runs contrary to what the fantasy genre has taught us to expect of magic, and yet it is precisely appropriate to the story the writer tells.<br />This is also where the wisdom resides. The mage is more powerful than he seems. In the end, despite his humility, his power is revealed as something vast. One must delve deep to see his power, and deeper still to understand his nature. The heroine's journey takes her to such depths, and in journeying with her; we come to understand the essence of such depth.<br />If this depiction of the book sounds seriousand weighty, this is because, to some extent, such a depiction is true. It takes a contemplative soul to appreciate this book, and it will disappoint many who come seeking simpler pleasures. This is the second of a series of three (I will always think of Earthsea as a trilogy) and far and away the most muted. It is not for everyone; but for those willing to commit the emotional investment, it reveals itself as the slow middle movement in a beautiful concerto; missing perhaps the sweep and power of its sister movements, but possessing an intimate grandeur of its own.	2000-11-29

It should never have been written.<br />The first three were works of wonder, touching on universal themes: sublime, compelling, cogent and inspiring. They asked large questions and arrived at honest answers, but they did so gently and gracefully. The quiet unhurried voice is one that this author has honed to perfection. Her world of Earthsea ranks among the very classics, alongside Middle Earth, Narnia and Avalon.<br />Here, everything that made Earthsea so inspiring and evocative is sacrificed to make a point. Le Guin has decided that the fourth book of the series shall be a polemic - an undisguised and prolonged treatise directed at female empowerment and decrying child abuse. Are these worthy moral pursuits? Of course they are. Do they belong in the world of Earthsea? Not even remotely.<br />This book was one of the most excruciating and disappointing reads I have ever undertaken. It's not the writing or the skill - the author's proficiency remains unparalleled - but the desecration of what was magnificent. The skill with which this work is written actually adds to the anguish; we remember what this skill was harnessed to build and cannot help but contrast it to what it is now being used to destroy.<br />Reading this book, one is struck by how fragile a fantasy world like Earthsea really is. Earthsea works because, like all myth, it is founded in a successful illusion. When an author creates such a world, she makes a pact with the reader: \\"Accept this illusion, and we will journey to a place more vital than any you have known.\\" If the author ever forgets this promise, if she ever turns from the myth to the commonplace, the illusion collapses and the world disintegrates.<br />In this novel, Earthsea suffers precisely such a fate. The mysterious is rendered mundane, fantasy is replaced with reality, imagination is sacrificed to treatise, and the philosophical is surrendered to the prosaic. In the process, Earthsea is reduced to plain old earth. Our imagination is arrested in mid flight and we land with a shattering thump.<br />The third book of the series was a magnificent work. The hero must save Earthsea from the death of its magic. He succeeds, but at great personal cost. In this book, the magic of Earthsea truly dies, but the death comes at the hands of its author and for reasons that are unworthy. This is one of the few books that actively destroys what has gone before. This destruction is so complete that I wish I had never read it and that the memory of Earthsea had been preserved for me unstained.	2000-11-29

Kay's is such a fresh voice in what is often a formulaic genre, that one is predisposed to looking favourably on every one of his contributions. But this work is missing a piece from its core that thwarts any heartfelt enjoyment.<br />There is nothing wrong with having ones emotions manipulated. This is what fiction is all about. But there is a difference between sincere and insincere, and the Lions of Al Rassan manipulates insincerely. Kay seems to have become so conscious of his considerable talents that he succumbs to artifice - like those insufferable operatic arias inserted for no reason but to show off the technical range of the Diva.<br />Kay's goals are worthy ones. The supernatural has almost completely disappeared because no purpose is served by its inclusion. Characters and their actions act ostensibly through the vagaries of history, and the only concession to the genre is that the historical setting is an alternate to the closing days of Moorish Spain.<br />Did I say vagaries? This is partly where the story fails, because there are no vagaries. Characters march from action to action, thought to thought, feeling to feeling. It is all laid out with surgical precision. There is nothing left to the imagination. This is a story that could have used more vagary.<br />Then again, vagary is not the same as deficiency. A city is sacked, its inhabitants slaughtered; the heroine is devastated, and we are expected to jump from an intellectual identification with her feelings to an emotional one. But how? We don't know this city. We never know its sounds, its inhabitants, its life. We form no attachment to it. Thereafter, the heroine's feelings do not involve us. We follow her subsequent actions on an intellectual level but find ourselves emotionally detached. There are similar deficiencies throughout.<br />Overall, Kay pushes for effect while taking short cuts. This leads to a contrived and self-conscious effort that exposes the author's literary devices with painful clarity. I sometimes felt that I was reading passages filled with bold type and exclamation marks. Strange, coming from an author who has previously shown such mastery of nuance.<br />I don't want to leave the impression that the work is without redemption. Kay at his worst is still better than most fantasy authors at their best. However, in Tigana and A Song for Arbonne, he has shown what he is really capable of and raised the bar of expectations to a higher setting. With Al Rassan, he fails to clear that mark.	2000-11-12

In his preceding work, Tigana, he has already dropped the plethora of non-human and mythical entities that are an obligatory part of most fantasy settings. Here, he further reins in the role of magic. In A Song for Arbonne, magic is reduced to a completely subsidiary function. It is used only to supply a motive for one kingdom's conflict with another.<br />This is an entirely good thing. By divesting himself of fireballs, voodoo and the most overwrought elements of the supernatural, Kay has freed himself to play to his strengths: his gift for characterization, his lyrical voice and his facility with evocation.<br />This is not to say that there is anything wrong with a basic blood-and-guts sword and sorcery epic. Some of my favourite tales are Howard's original Conan stories. But Kay is a different writer. He is strongest when depicting the human condition. He does not paint dragons or demons convincingly. But his balladeers are so real that you swear he must have lived as one in a prior life.<br />It is not a perfect work. The changing tenses are confusing and unnecessary. Allusions are sometimes indulgent. The main character arrives at his redemption a tad too easily. The antagonists are not fleshed out deeply enough. Some of the secondary characters need more to do. But these are quibbles. They are noticeable only because Kay has achieved such a high standard throughout, that any criticism must focus on the niggling stuff. However, they are distracting enough to prevent a perfect score.<br />So what is there to recommend this book? Kay has produced a world so textured and substantial that we are intrigued more by the imaginary land of Arbonne than the real land of Provence after which it is modelled. We care not only for the main characters, but for all its inhabitants. A land so given to music and courtly love brings out the romantic within us. And Kay presents it with suchgrace and moderation that it is never forced or affected. As a result, the inner journey of the main protagonist from dour cynicism to compassionate nobility is entirely believable.<br />Kay's writings are not for everyone. His later work, especially, strays further and further from the comfort zone of fantasy, and this alienates many readers who are attracted to fantasy precisely because of the comfort zone. It is as if a mystery writer neglected to include a murder or a romance novelist foreswore any scenes of heartbreak. Kay appeals more to the introspective sort who appreciates human drama, in whichever setting it may take place, and feels at home with departures from the formula. For such a reader, this is a treasured find.	2000-11-11

What they don't see is that Kay intended it so - he has taken an artistic discipline, and mirrored it in his writing. The Byzantines made the art of mosaic more central to their cultural and spiritual life than any civilisation before or since. Kay has used mosaic as a writer's conceit. The lives of his various characters are presented to us in fragments, like pieces of tile; allowed to scintillate on their own while being assembled into a greater whole. Up close, each piece is unique and tells us its own particular story. But as we recede from near to far, the form and pattern of an empire emerges.<br />The use of this kind of metaphor is not new. Kay has used it earlier in his Fionavar trilogy. There, the metaphor was a tapestry and the lives of each character a thread. But in that earlier work, he could not resist the temptation to push his metaphor in our face. Here he has learned restraint. In fact, he submerges the metaphor so successfully into the texture of his work, that its presence passes most of us by. This is as it should be. It is meant to be felt, not noticed.<br />There is something else admirable about this work - its quiet voice. In Kay's earlier works, his characters undergo the profoundest changes through singularly defining experiences. I often found such changes abrupt and contrived. Here, it is different. Here, Kay takes his time. The main character lays aside his survivor's guilt and rediscovers his joy for life in increments. His life change is entirely believable because we are witness to its evolution.<br />This is a wonderful duology for people who find pleasure in the nuances of human complexity. It is oblique, subtle, restrained, multi-layered and evocative. But it does not conform to the trappings of fantasy. There's little magic and even less mayhem. The only battle scenes involve two urban riots - hardly the fiery stuff of typical sword and sorcery. It's a shame, really, that this work has been co-opted into the fantasy genre. Hard core genre readers will find it tepid while detractors of the genre will avoid it through association. For my part, I hope that Kay continues to evolve. His latest work puts him within the first rank of Canadian writers.	2000-11-10

It is as if he hasn't enough confidence in the mastery of his craft to trust to understatement and restraint. Instead, he strikes for bold effects, and ends up with melodrama.<br />Melodrama has its place and, when done well, can be quite effective. Consider Les Miserables or A Tale of Two Cities. But here, it is not done well. Perhaps I am alone in my weariness, but I am tired of Elves and Dwarves, Dragons and Trolls, and appendices to Arthurian myth. This story parallels the Lord of the Rings so obviously that it is rendered formulaic: the fellowship of protagonists with varying characters and strengths; the wizard who leads them; the dark antagonist in his invincible fortress who is the very embodiment of malice and desolation; the lonely quest by a tortured soul, carrying a great burden into the heart of danger. Even the mountain is here. And the Arthurian elements are, frankly, tired and distracting. It's all been done before and done better.<br />Then there are the characters. They can only be described as uni-dimensional. The antagonists are cartoon bad guys; the protagonists are stereotypical personality types; the secondary characters are introduced and have their respective moments, but are often dropped and forgotten with disjointed ease.<br />Take the case of a southern princess seduced by a northern prince. First she loves him. Then she hates him. Then she loves him again. I'll try not to give away too much of the plot, but what motivates such conflicting emotions and what happens to her in the end? We don't know. It's unconvincing and incomplete.<br />I don't want to leave the impression that I actively dislike the work. Some of it is quite good. Kay shows flashes of the brilliance that characterize his later works. His writing is regal and elegant. He may not have learned yet that less is better, but he shows a gift for presentation that often intrigues and occasionally compels.<br />This is a series only for hardcore fantasy buffs. It makes no attempt to transcend its genre. It adheres to the fantasy formula so conventionally, that its main appeal will be to those readers who read fantasy for the comfort of the formula. However, the overall skill and the occasional nugget saves it from failure and earns it a guarded recommendation.	2000-11-10

Stripped of all artifice and affectation. He leaves only the very essence - of art, of life, of creation.<br />In reading the various reviews, it seems that many young people have read this work as part of their class curriculum. It pains me to see how so many of them have had their perception of it directed - no, constrained - to the wrong things. Their teachers should be ashamed of themselves. They have taken something exquisite and eloquent and unadorned, and coated it, suffocating its splendour with &quot;symbolism&quot; and &quot;interpretation&quot;. The Old Man and the Sea is not about symbolism. It's not about Christ parallels, or communing with Mother Earth, or the price we pay for ambition.<br />It TELLS us, clearly and poignantly, what it's about. And we must have the humility to take it at its word. It's about struggle, and courage, and pity, and proving something to the only two beings that really count in the end - our Maker and our Self.<br />There's nothing complicated in any of this. And Hemingway strives to reflect these simple, yet powerful truths in language that is likewise simple and powerful. He succeeds beyond measure.<br />To properly understand this work, we must actually oppose modern teaching. We must resist the temptation to analyse. We must strip away bombastic complexity and artifice. This is a story about essences. It is set away from civilisation, in the majestic vastness of the sea, precisely so that there can be no distraction, no adornment, no artifice. Adding such elements does not further the understanding; it only pollutes.<br />As is true of all great works of literature, this one is not for everyone. If your depth extends no further than low-rent thrills, then don't bother. You will find this book boring. Similarly, effete intellectuals need not apply. There's nothing here that appeals to cheap cynicism, nor to cowardice masquerading under the guise of sophistication.<br />This story is a great man's parting gift to you and me. It speaks with pity and a deep sorrow to those lonely acts of courage, large and small, about which no one will ever know. Only our Maker and our Self. What a masterpiece.	2000-10-16
US	49192633	RJ892LU7FIVTW	0451451155	446908784	TIGANA	Books	5	21	24	N	N	Sublime Paean to the Human Spirit	Tigana is that rarest of books; one that dares to transcend its genre and aspire to great literature. It is not plot driven or even primarily character driven, though Kay develops both plot and character with a deftness that is a wonder to behold. Rather, this work is driven by themes: it exquisitely balances cruelty and compassion, conscience and necessity, love and tyranny, honour and betrayal, memory and loss; and it accomplishes all this with a lyricism that verges on poetry.<br />There are few outright villains in this work, and just as importantly, few outright heroes. In this, as in so much else, Kay seeks to reflect the complexity of life. Just one finely balanced contrast must suffice.<br />The key antagonist, Brandin, is a supremely complex man. Unlike the antagonists of lesser works, we come to empathise with him. He is deeply flawed - he would expunge an entire culture from human history for the sake of a bitter personal vengeance. At the same time, he is worthy of praise, of devotion, even of love. Except for the land that he has sworn to destroy, he seeks to rule wisely, justly and, within the limitations of his Machiavellian world, compassionately. We come to understand him not as a bad man but as one who betrays his innate goodness first for glory and then for a grief filled hatred.<br />Brandin's consort, Dianora, must live with a betrayal of a different sort, for she betrays her homeland, her family and her oath of vengeance for the love of this man. As the story unfolds, we understand why. We cannot condemn her. She sees the nobility that is in him. And the measure of that nobility is the sacrifice he is prepared to make, renouncing his larger inheritance and willingly reducing himself to the rule of an insignificant island kingdom, simply that Dianora may become his queen. Only a heart of stone would fail to be moved by the fate that eventually befalls these two.<br />This is only one of many intricate threads at work within the book. Yet, the whole flows with such a refined balance that to read Tigana is to sense a master storyteller at the height of his calling.<br />I would not recommend Tigana to everybody. It is a work rich with layers, undercurrents and deep subtlety. Those who read fantasy only for the clashes of armies, the duels of wizards, dragons, demons and vigorous action will find this book disappointing. But if you prefer your fantasy leavened with wisdom, pity and humanity, Tigana will fill you with a sublime compassion for the human condition that will have you dreaming about this haunting world for perhaps the rest of your life.	2000-10-11

In the wonderful tradition of Sagan, Cousteau and Asimov, Professor Gordon  shows us that science and technology need not be abstruse and tedious, but  can be made both pleasant and fascinating. Structures, or Why Things Don't  Fall Down stands perfectly well on its own, but the best benefits are to be  derived when reading it in tandem with its sister publication, The New  Science of Strong Materials. In both books, Professor Gordon strikes the  difficult balance between the ease of exposition and the exactness of  detail that characterises only the very best of scientific popularisations.  He combines his technical presentation with a warm and self-deprecating wit  that will have you feeling that you are not being lectured to, so much as  enjoying an engaging explanation from a friend.<br />For example, in a typical  moment of whimsy, Professor Gordon speculates upon the benefits of  attaching army surplus chicken feathers onto motor cars - a suggestion  designed to evoke a humourous image, except that his preceding explication  on the structural properties of feathers is done so well that it lends the  idea a certain fanciful credence. The pages are filled with such moments.  Professor Gordon delights in drawing parallels between the unlikeliest of  phenomena - how an intelligent reflection on the properties of worms led  him to the design of a better anchor bracket, or how his introduction to a  circus proprietor's somewhat self-conscious invention ended up improving  everything from military aircraft to household doors. Through the liberal  use of such anecdotes, he leads us, gently but inexorably, to a fuller  understanding of the interconnectedness of the physical world.<br />While his  book deals with abstract ideas, Professor Gordon comes across clearly as a  practical man. Whereas others would deal only with joints and fastenings,  he chooses to title one chapter &quot;Joints, Fastenings and People&quot;.  He does so with especial purpose because his hands-on and sometimes tragic  experience has won him the understanding that most joints fail not from  want of material strength, but from human negligence. Anyone who has ever  taken responsibility for the work of others will sympathise with his  observation that: &quot;All of our efforts to persuade [the aircraft  workers] that a badly made joint was morally equivalent to manslaughter  foundered on a deeply-held folk tradition that it was silly to fuss about  such things and that strength is a boring subject anyway.&quot; Professor  Gordon always manages to marry each abstraction with a human element and  this is what makes his narrative so engaging and so relevant.<br />While  extremely well written, this is not a book for dilettantes. Professor  Gordon does not evade mathematics, although he keeps it to a minimum and  always to the point. Where necessary, he does not spare the technical  details, but he has both the mastery and the skill to make it go down  easily and the reader always comes away from the experience feeling  enriched. Those who are completely mathematically phobic can still follow  the general thrust of his narrative while skipping the formulae.<br />This is  popularisation at its best and Professor Gordon's works should be required  reading not only for aspiring engineers but for all university  undergraduates.	2000-07-10
