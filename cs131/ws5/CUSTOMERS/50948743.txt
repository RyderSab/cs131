Gore is a politician, and he does what politicians do at their best--inspire us with the possible, and pass on a sense of optimism about the future.  Most importantly, he questions (with facts at his side) the notion that humanity must choose between prosperity and environmental protection.  He also defies those who think that all environmentalists are wild-eyed radicals by questioning some of the more extreme &quot;deep ecology&quot; ideas, as well as the notion that Christianity is responsible for the environmental crisis.  This is a very important book.	2002-11-18

The focus on individuals makes the book all the more moving; the author's knowledge of and sympathy for the subject country comes through clearly.  One can't knock the stories of the Kuwaitis; I was a little disappointed in the author (mention is made of the Kuwaiti government's lack of democracy, which she rationalizes by resorting to the old &quot;a nation's internal policies are no one else's business&quot; excuse, also used by none other than Saddam Hussein).  For this, I was forced to deduct a star from the rating.	2000-09-24

While Heyerdahl is not an especially modest person, he has a  great gift for a witty yarn, which keeps the book entertaining at all  times.

If so,  it is definitely worth searching out for fans of the original Star Wars  movie, much more so than most of the other tie-in merchandise from that  film.  The black-and-white ink drawings offer many insights into the design  and creation of the film's legendary ships and vehicles (the door to the  Millenium Falcon was apparently quite a challenge!)

It is filled with history and lore that may keep you  browsing for hours if you have even the slightest interest in the Old West,  or in American culture in general. While somewhat dated (it was first  published in the 1950's), it also highlights genuinely little-known  history, such as the &quot;Rustler War&quot; in Wyoming in the 1890's. The  information about famous Old West artists like Frederick Remington could be  valuable to art historians as well.  Speaking of art, the illustrations by  Jackie and Fiore Mastri add greatly to the book's appeal, as does Grant's  cleverly-written text.  Even the typeface is well-chosen.

Her critique of radical feminism is written well, and makes some very useful points (particularly her argument against  the idea, promulgated by some radicals, that there is something inherently  &quot;male&quot; about scientific inquiry, and &quot;female&quot; about  intuition and going by one's feelings).  There are just too many things she  leaves out. For example, she divides feminists into &quot;equity&quot;  feminists (the good, non-radical ones) and &quot;gender&quot; feminists  (the radicals she is attacking).  She has a lot to say about the latter  group, but almost nothing to say about the former.  What is it that equity  feminists want?  What are their tactics?  Most critically, do they have any  goals that would offend conservatives, and are they willing to do so to  achieve them?  When one matches up this omission with Sommers' insistence  that most of the goals of feminism have been achieved (she argues that the  much-mentioned male-female pay gap is vanishing, if it ever actually  existed), one begins to wonder why Sommers thinks there should be anything  called &quot;feminism&quot; at all.<br />There is more in this vein,  unfortunately.  Sommers (like everyone else, with hindsight) ties herself  to the tradition of Susan B. Anthony and her sisters, claiming that they  were the original equity feminists.  She also knows her history too well  not to mention that they were called radical, man-haters, and lots of far  worse names in their time.  What I want to know from her, however, is how  the people who called Anthony and her cohorts all those names are different  from the people who *nowadays* call feminists all kind of nasty names.  There may very well be a difference, but Sommers' book doesn't say anything  about it.<br />Unfortunately, it becomes all too clear that Sommers' book  (like Dinesh D'Souza's work on campus political correctness) is selective  in this manner because of a political agenda.  She wants us to think that  the Democratic Party is in the thrall of radical feminism (an idea that  must seem laughable to groups like NOW, who regularly, if falsely, insist  that the Democrats and Republicans are carbon copies of each other).  What  is clearly needed is a critique of the most zealous aspects of feminism by  someone within that movement, someone writing with more credibility.

The Emberley books use about two dozen simple shapes (dots, lines, right and equilateral  triangles, and so on) to draw a wide variety of animals, vehicles,  monsters, and any number of other things.

As a young man, he took up painting with the WPA artist program and made left-leaning, social-realist murals and canvases in many places around the country.  By  the late 1940's, he had moved on to abstraction, producing shimmering,  painterly works that were somewhere between the dynamism of Jackson Pollock  and the stillness of Mark Rothko.  In the last ten years of his life,  influenced by the restlessness of the 60's, he painted Robert Crumb-like  cartoonish images that hinted at even darker comic nightmares than Crumb  ever imagined (and, more occasionally, the uplifting power of love and  idealism).  This last phase may have been the best of all.  Storr's great  book is an excellent exegesis of all three of these hard-to-follow  transitions, by an artist that simply did not make analysis easy.  The  mostly full-color illustrations complement the text almost perfectly.	2000-07-02

If it had been around when I was 13, I would have been unable to put it down.  Now, I'm 31, and I am unable to put it down.  You simply don't have to be young or adolescent  to enjoy this book.  It is just specific and detailed enough to paint a  vivid picture, and also (like many of Samuel Beckett's best books) just  abstract enough to be timeless. Stanley Yelnats--the main character, a  nebbish punished (like all of us, occasionally) without any sense of  fairness--does not make us relate to him by being a superficial copy of  anyone.  He, and the other characters--especially Mr. Sir, a macho  overseer, and the other boys enduring youth correction camp--are  understandable because they are so very *real.*   Every character in the  book is like a statue carved in wood, and etched with both wit and  compassion.   Mark my words--people will still be reading this book 100  years from now.  They may be astounded to know that it dates back all the  way to the early 21st Century.	2000-06-08

Edward Abbey is quite possibly the most overrated author of the 20th Century.  For proof, look no further then this little book of pseudo-wisdom.  You'll have the pleasure of watching as Ed spouts tiresome  untruths (all government is bad, all science is bad, all rebels are good,  etc.) with the petulant attitude that he is the very first person in  history to say them all, and that it makes him great.  Environmentalists  who think that Abbey was some kind of hero might be shocked by the elitist  arrogance of this &quot;man of the people&quot; (he thanks nuclear  physicists for inventing the atomic bomb) or by right-wing moronics worthy  of the most brainless militiaman (&quot;the rifle and handgun are  'equalizers'--the weapons of a democracy&quot;). Abbey even puts the s-word  in print and brags about it as if he were the first person on the planet to  do it.  If you are an environmentalist (like me) and you want inspiration,  read Emerson, read John Muir, even read Wendell Berry--but skip Edward  Abbey.	2000-06-07

You don't have to be from San Fran to love this little story, although I am sure that it helps.  The plot follows Charlie the cable car as he and a favorite passenger (the narrator, who is Caen himself, of course) leave the  cable car routes and decide to explore their hometown of San Francisco,  coming into contact with Chu, a Chinese New Year's dragon.  Caen's  legendary wit is surprisingly well-suited to this kind of writing; I loved  his personification of the young cable car (he compares Charlie's voice to  &quot;a piece of wood being rubbed across steel&quot;).  Byfield's  watercolors help tell the story (making the book a good mixture of visuals  and text) but are also pleasures in and of themselves.  <br />The story does  not have a very specific and blunt point for children to take away (which  is fine with me). That said, it does imply that thinking out of the box (or  off the trolley routes) is good and that making friends with people from  other cultures is beneficial.  Kind of appropriate for San Francisco when  you think about it.	2000-04-06

His most distinctive work uses his native language--American Sign Language, or ASL--in playful ways that combine the  images of the language with more conventional art images. In one of the  best pieces, &quot;Tyger, Tyger,&quot; he overlays a threatening image of a  tiger with the sign for &quot;tiger.&quot;  I hate to use a cliche, but  this dreamlike piece truly has to be seen to be believed.  Baird also  produces more conventional artwork, including photorealistic paintings  something like those of Don Eddy.  My favorite work is a study of an  old-fashioned camera with bright colors as succulent as those of Wayne  Thiebaud or any Pop artist.  The reproductions are very well done.	2000-04-05

McNair is a bit of an ingredient-snob (he  seems horrified by the idea that anyone would use anything but a tomato  ripped from the vine moments ago to make a pizza).  That said, the book  will help you unleash your creativity before you stick that Boboli in the  oven.

As their name implies, they are not  emotional expressions (like the work of Rothko) or heavily-distilled  versions of real images (like many of Ellsworth Kelly's pictures). Instead,  they seem to follow Donald Judd's dictum that a size, volume, or shape is  something of itself; what to make of that something is largely up to the  viewer.  I, personally, love the way that the huge (often 10 feet tall)  drawings are smooth and calming from a distance, but turn out to have a  harsh and earthy texture when the viewer moves to a closer location.   Unfortunately, this is not visible in a book of small reproductions such as  this one.  (I wish that the authors had included a detail of one of the  works.)  Sometimes, you just have to see the real artwork for yourself.	2000-03-20

(I have always doubted others' insistence that our culture has been turned by television and computers into a short-attention-span travesty, but now I am  reconsidering that skepticism.) If this book is boring, a speech by Martin  Luther King is boring. A beautiful day at the beach, or on a mountain, is  boring. A beautiful woman is--boring. And frankly, if you think those  things are boring, I have little use for your opinion.<br />More pertinently,  there is so much about this book that is so moving, and what is moving is  exciting by definition (at least in MY opinion). The universality of  Paton's dialogues, the way he shifts so effortlessly from present to past  tense to convey tension and emotion, his command of the Zulu culture and of  the history and terror of his native land--all of these factors are simply  astounding. This is a book people will read three centuries from now--and  it will be just as exciting then.	2000-03-12

This is most useful  for NPC's, but there is also no reason that a player character's basic  stats cannot be selected from this book as well (since the book has only  bare-bones information, doing this will require the player to flesh out his  PC's remaining traits).

It was Palmer (the author) that  bothered me.  As I was reading the book, I could not help but feel that she  was trying to manipulate me, tugging at heartstrings that needed no tug to  be moved by these heartfelt stories.  I felt a bit patronized by her.

This may be the best of all the modules (pre-designed ready-to-play adventures) that TSR published for Dungeons and Dragons.  Mike Carr, the original writer (I'm not sure why Gary Gygax is credited above) did a  brilliant job fleshing out each room of the dungeon to the tiniest detail,  giving adventurers lots to explore and discover.  He also left out just  enough detail (including the specific placement of monsters and treasure)  to allow the DM to adapt the adventure to players or characters of any  experience level, and to his or her inclinations. The detailed descriptions  of rooms and materials are good enough to be &quot;borrowed&quot; and used  in other scenarios. Even the map is well-done, although the shade of blue  used for the printing is too dim (as is the case with all the old D&amp;D  modules).   This one is well worth searching out at used game stores or at  the next Con you attend.	1999-12-31

D2  introduces another evil nemesis, the fishlike kuo-toa.  These adventures  are fascinating for their relative complexity (a D&amp;D group could meet  once a week for three hours and still be working on these modules after six  months on that schedule) and for the flexibility that they give the DM to  flesh out the situations.  The main negative is that not enough creativity  was put into the problems facing the players--the modules seem to encourage  the combat/heal/combat/heal pointlessness that D&amp;D can become at its  worst.  (Contrast this with a module like C2, the Shrine of Tamoachan,  which seems to require a decision of some kind in virtually every room!)   My suggestion for the DM would be to buy the module and then add his or her  creativity to it in order to give the players a chance to use their  cleverness and skills, instead of just using their battle axes.	1999-12-23

She convincingly traces his development from realistic imagery through  Miro-like surrealism to his distinctive ethereal but emotional rectangles.   Along the way, she makes a good case for his stubborn insistence that his  work did, in fact, have a subject.  At least one other art-thinker, Georgia  O'Keeffe, caught on to this (in a documentary made a few years before she  died, O'Keeffe commented that a Rothko piece in the MOMA seemed like a  timeline of a man's life), as did at least one of Rothko's more sensitive  collectors (this is chronicled in the book).  This, in my opinion, is why  Rothko's work isn't ideally suited for calm meditation, unlike that of some  other abstract artists (which is not to say that being meditative is a bad  thing, by the way). I would recommend this book to anyone who doesn't quite  get modern art, and is willing to put some effort into the task.	1999-11-08

Chenhall's System for Classifying Man-Made Objects	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Needs an update	As a museum cataloger, I've now worked with Chenhall's system in several contexts, and on both 19th and  20th century museum collections.  The system is great for the former  (especially with its specialized vocabulary for wood, metal, and  agricultural tools) but needs an update to be more useful for the latter.   I used to work on the Park Service's Vietnam Veterans Memorial Collection,  and we found ourselves inventing new terms frequently (although we were  still able to use the item-purpose taxonomy).	1999-10-31

It's a combination of beautiful cat illustrations (which are really almost portraits) and tongue-in-cheek  poetry that captures the nuances of personality with which all cat owners  are familiar.  My fiancee and I have had fun writing Leman-esque poetry  about our own cats, inspired, of course, by this book.	1999-10-31

Both men can write about their subjects fascinatingly and in layman's terms  without dumbing down the material. That said, Gould is more down-to-earth,  with a sense of humor that is more uplifting than caustic. In  &quot;Bathybius and Eozoon&quot; (no, that's not a comic book duo) and  &quot;Crazy Old Randolph Kirkpatrick,&quot; he takes a look back at two of  science's more oddball mistakes while reminding us that scientists are more  human than shallow stereotypes might allow.  &quot;The Great Scablands  Debate&quot; questions the widely-held notion that all geological (and, by  extension, evolutionary) change happens at a snail's pace.  In  &quot;Women's Brains&quot; and &quot;Dr. Down's Syndrome,&quot; he  questions some of the uses to which science has been put in the past, while  not (unlike certain feminists who should know better) discarding the whole  idea of science altogether. There are even essays on the (supposed)  stupidity of dinosaurs and on Mickey Mouse, which might make excellent  reading for a child with good reading skills and an incipient interest in  science.	1999-10-31

Sorensen  is an eloquent writer, both principled and pragmatic, who is more  respectful to his/our opposition than you would expect (but not without  explaining *why* they're his opposition!)  His historical background as a  witness to the Kennedy years enhances his credibility.  While it is short  on specific facts (for that, I would recommend American Prospect Magazine,  or an E. J. Dionne book), Sorensen's book is inspirational and moving, and  will always have a prominent place on my shelf.  What a pity that it's out  of print.	1999-10-30
US	50948743	RSTZU97EPD00M	0810915545	539739082	Ad Reinhardt	Books	5	17	18	N	N	A good introduction	Aside from being rather expensive, this is an excellent introducion to Ad Reinhardt, perhaps the most irascible and independent of the (by their own  description) irascible abstract expressionist artists of the 1940's and  50's.  There are enough reproductions that you can see Ad's development,  and they were done very well technically.  This is an achievement because  Reinhardt's late paintings, which relied on very subtle gradations of  black, have to be among the hardest to reproduce in the history of art.   (By the way, they are also good paintings to show to people who think  abstract art does not take any skill.)  The introductory essays are more  readable than much of what has been written about modern art.  However, the  best writing about Ad Reinhardt's work was that of Reinhardt himself  He  was a very witty and idiosyncratic writer who fiercely defended his  attitude about art and life in prose that is sometimes difficult, but  always funny and ultimately enlightening.  This book is comprehensive  enough to be a mini-anthology of Reinhardt's writings.  If you can possibly  look at this book before you buy it, I would do so, since it is so  expensive; if you like abstract art, however, I think you will find it  beguiling.	1999-10-30

I seem to remember reading a critic who said of James Joyce that his writing was (I am paraphrasing) not *about* anything, but was, instead, the thing  itself.  While I love Joyce, I think that this statement applies even more  perfectly to Mr. Stevens. Let be be finale of seem!	1999-10-19
