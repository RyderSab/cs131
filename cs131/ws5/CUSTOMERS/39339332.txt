It's written in the first-person in a semi-stream-of-consciousness style and was, for me, almost impossible to enjoy, or follow. The moral dilemma and dichotomy of being a cynical virgin in today's society just wasn't enough to string together this rather random story, which lacked plot and pacing. It just wasn't enjoying to try and read--more like work, than fun. I focused so much on HOW the book was written (and it was poorly written, as far as I am concerned), I was never ever able to enjoy the story, such as it was.	2001-10-17

Or do you even need a father (i.e. your very own &quot;Big Bird,&quot; as in Sesame Street, to love and take care of you and the proposed little one)? Or do you even need the kid? Zigman makes the whole motherhood/career/relationship struggle very funny and emminently readable. <br />Zigman doesn't break any new ground in &quot;Dating Big Bird&quot; and the ending is far too pat, but the entire story is funny, fast-paced and entertaining. Mommies and single gals alike will recognize the characters, even if they are a bit cliched. (Cliches are cliches for a reason--they're often true.)	2001-10-17

Her father, a neglectful artist, gains little sympathy from this reader (he may &quot;intend&quot; to be a good father, but he isn't), nor does the too politically-correct, pseudo-radical mother, who late in the story becomes desperately ill.<br />Set in the 1950s, &quot;Some Things That Stay&quot; is a beautifully-written coming of age story. You probably won't like or approve of the character's actions, or motivations, but they seem real, in the strange, dysfunctional way that has become all too common. The born-again Christian neighbors, the random experimentation with sex for lack of anything better to do ... all seem real and believable, if not admirable. Though some readers will be disappointed that the characters don't &quot;learn something&quot; from their many mistakes, I think it's far more realistic that life does just go on, without big moral shifts or life reassessments. That's the way it is in the real world. Things don't always &quot;just work out in the end.&quot;<br />Willis' voice as an author is clear and sharp and I look forward to reading more by this talented storyteller!	2001-10-17

(I don't just say &quot;Chinese food&quot; because I've been to China and what we eat here, even in the most &quot;authentic&quot; restaurants I've visited, doesn't really resemble the real, everyday Chinese cooking you see in, say, Beijing. And, having seen what &quot;real, everyday Chinese cooking&quot; is, I have to say that that's probably a good thing. &quot;Real&quot; Chinese cooking just does not gel well with American palettes, in my humble opinion.) Well, when a job took me from the coast back to the Midwest I was tortured by the lack of quality Chinese cuisine and decided that if I wanted it done right, I'd have to do it myself, so I set out to become a stir fry pro.<br />My first step was picking up a couple of Chinese cookbooks, the best of which turned out to be &quot;Yan Kit's Classic Chinese Cookbook.&quot; The book features simple, step-by-step recipes for all the &quot;traditional&quot; Chinese take-out style food Americans have come to love. Everything is easy to understand and, once you get the technique down, it's incredibly easy to adjust the recipes to your own taste, or substitute ingredients you have on hand. After all, stir fry is meant to be a very casual kind of cooking. (This book offers far more than just stir fry recipes but those and things like the dim sum and potsticker recipes are the pages I turn to most.)<br />I'm not sure how &quot;authentic&quot; the meals I prepare are but I know that my family always asks for seconds and we never order Chinese take out anymore.	2001-10-05

And I have to say that &quot;The Way to Cook&quot; is one big, beautiful cookbook. The huge tome is filled with full color photographs of not just completed dishes (the so-called &quot;beauty shots&quot;) but detailed shots of the step-by-step techniques needed to prepare the often complicated recipes--a feature I found extremely helpful.<br />I really liked this book, but I have to say the title is a real misnomer. This is NOT a book for beginners who want to learn to cook (for that I'd recommend &quot;The Betty Crocker Cookbook&quot; or maybe &quot;The Best Recipe&quot; from &quot;Cook's Illustrated), it's an advanced course for wanna-be gourmets. If you don't love to cook, or don't enjoy making &quot;fancy&quot; dishes (though there are a few &quot;basics,&quot; this book focuses on Child's forte, classical French cooking that's pretty enough to serve in a restaurant), then this cookbook isn't for you. But if you're ready to expand your cooking horizons, I think this title is perfect.<br />One more note ... a fan of Martha Stewarts television cooking segments I noticed that a great number of the techniques that Martha promotes come straight from Child. Something I never realized before reading &quot;The Way to Cook.&quot;	2001-10-05

Her gently-paced, east-to-read stories, are laced with her own past (she's a third generation Italian-American) and make any reader understand what it means to possess (or be stuck with, depending on how you look at) a specific ethnic identity. <br />&quot;Sometimes I Dream in Italian&quot; is a sometimes funny, always poignant look at the Lupo family, whose daughters wish their father, whom they call Babbo, would change his name from Carlucci to the preferably American &quot;Charles Wolf.&quot; The book, told from the perspective of younger daughter Angelina, known a Angel, bounces back and fourth between the Lupo girls less-than-perfect childhood and their equally unsettled present. <br />Ciresi doesn't rely on tired plot devices to entice readers to delve into the lives of the Lupo clan--there are no melodramatic events (planes crashes, kidnappings, child abuse, etc) to push the plot along--it's just the simple story of one family; a story very much like the stories all families have. Still, you're drawn to this obviously dysfunctional, but no more so that most, clan's tale--sucked in by the very ordinariness of their story. Ciresi is to be commended for making the every day seem extraordinary in her prose.	2001-10-01

The &quot;Sour Cream Frosting&quot; has been added to my repertoire as a great, all-purpose dessert topper and the truly unusual &quot;Lemon Pie Unique,&quot; adapted from an old Sunkist recipe, is a show stopper of a dinner party dessert--looks great; a real &quot;guest impresser.&quot; (My advice: add an extra half cup of sugar to cut the tartness. It's also great served with whipped heavy cream.)<br />My only complaint with this slim volume, which also features a wealth of &quot;old-time cooking&quot; trivia and lots of great artwork, is its brevity. At only 92 pages, including the introduction and index, this book only boasts about 40 recipes. And, if you figure that most people only find about a quarter of the recipes in any cookbooks appealing, well, that's not a great value.<br />As with any cookbook, I suggest a &quot;try before you buy&quot; philosophy. Most libraries boast an extensive cookbook collection. You can check out the book's value for free by taking it home and trying it out. If you're a real penny pincher you can simply photocopy any recipes you think you'll want to use again.	2001-10-01

I had heard good things from a friend (who has a two year old) but just couldn't get into this self-righteous and unfunny book. Karbo eagerly adopts the &quot;all men are pigs&quot; attitude as each of her male characters lies around watching sports, failing to take care of his child and or wife in a suitable manner, most also invariably run into trouble keeping their zippers shut. While men can obviously be giant dufuses (is there a correct plural to &quot;dufus?&quot;) when it comes to fatherhood and/or romance not every man is an oversized five year old unwilling to do his part. I also can't recommend Karbo's whining female leads who are SO absorbed in their children's neediness they fail to recognize that there is a world outside their babies dirty diapers or fathom that not everyone thinks their child is the center of the universe. (I don't much like woman who are like this in real life either.) I kept wanting to shake Karbo's protagonist &quot;Brooke&quot; and say, &quot;Listen lady, you're not doing yourself or your kid any favors by totally ignoring your own life and turning yourself into the cloak of bitter complaining martyr. Take of the hair shirt and join the real world why don't you?&quot; Perhaps if I had some little ones underfoot I'd feel differently, but I just can't recommend this version of &quot;Motherhood&quot; to anyone.	2001-10-01

Based on historical fact, what little of it there is anyway (the painting is real, the history behind it imagined, but well researched), this story of a young maid/muse in the house of legendary Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer. It is a beautiful tale of love, jealousy and human nature. The characters are richly drawn and young girl, Griet, from whose perspective the story is told is a compelling and believable protagonist. <br />As interesting as the book's gentle plot (there are no big &quot;events,&quot; per se, but the book still manages to move along at a brisk pace), is the look at a culture little known to most Americans. &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; reminds me of other sweet, detail-oriented books I've read, such as &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha.&quot; Both transported me to another time and place which, before reading these novels, I knew little about but have learned to love, thanks to the author's writing prowess.	2001-09-28

I do remember watching her shows as a child, with my mother, and know she pioneered the genre, but the meals she made rarely appealed to me--too time consuming, too &quot;fussy&quot; and just too &quot;strange&quot; for every day taste. (If I have to visit eight different shops and peruse three mail order catalogs to make a dish, I'm probably not going to try it.)<br />Recently, I picked up &quot;Julia's Kitchen Wisdom&quot; at the library and was quickly sold. I am now ordering a copy to keep. The book is filled with useful basic recipes and techniques, as well as lots of helpful time-saving tips that Child has picked up over the years. It's not really a recipe book per se, though tried-and-true formulas for things like Hollandaise sauce and pastry dough do appear, it's more of a kitchen guide. It's full of ingredient substitutions, serving suggestions and definitions of terms you may come across. More useful to experienced cooks, it's also a helpful guide for the best technique, according to Child, for things like braising, searing, roasting and folding. Child's years in the kitchen have made here at master and I was pleasantly surprised to find many time-saving techniques and places were Child says the &quot;easy&quot; way is actually better.<br />This slim volume really packs a wallop of cooking information and I think it would make a nice addition to any cook's bookshelf.	2001-09-28

His case-by-case breakdown of some of the world's most famous unsolved (or possibly incorrectly solved) murders, including Jack the Ripper, Lizzie Borden and Jon Benet Ramsey, is well-researched and, as far as a lay person like myself can tell, highly accurate. Douglas makes a good case for a likely suspect TYPE in each case, and offers opinions in some as to the identity of the killer and validity of accepted evidence, but remains thoroughly professional and refrains from the lurid speculation often associated with &quot;true crime&quot; books. (He is particularly circumspect in the more modern cases, fearing, I'd assume, legal retaliation.)<br />In fact, therein lies the problem. Douglas is so professional that reading this book is like reading a police blotter, factual and insightful, but not very interesting. The prose is dry--more proof that Douglas did this (profiling) for a living, not even Mark Olshaker's writing skills can punch up Douglas' fact-by-fact analysis. I'm not usually a true crime fan and I don't obsessively follow serial killers or &quot;big cases&quot; on the news. Actually, I'm not even sure why I picked this book up, as it's a bit out of my typical fiction genre. I guess if I'd been more the audience this book was geared towards, I might have enjoyed it more. As it is, it just sort of creeped me out and made me realize (once again) the frightening number of truly sick individuals our modern world has spawned. Detailed reports on exactly how Jack the Ripper or Borden mutilated their victims (OK, their entire face was gone. Oh goody!) doesn't make for great bedtime reading as far as I'm concerned and as Douglas refers to case after case which has &quot;similar&quot; overtones to the more famous murders chronicled here you get the feeling that there's a serial killer around every corner. Mostly I just found myself wondering, again and again, how anyone can muck through horrors like this for a living. A book on how that affects someone's psyche might be REALLY interesting.	2001-09-28

Most of us remember the delicious meals our mother's and/or grandmother's whipped up without ever even glancing at a recipe. The problem is that the skills these women possessed were honed by years of experience--cooking three times per day for 30+ years--and usually instilled in them by their mother's and grandmother's in early childhood. The world has changed a lot since then and not only have our tastes vastly changed, but they've also expanded. Most of us regularly eat, and cook, many types of ethnic foods, as well as a host of &quot;healthy&quot; meals that would have baffled cooks in the 1930s and '40s.<br />So, instead of &quot;teaching&quot; people to &quot;cook without a book,&quot; as Anderson's title promises, it focuses more on how to put a meal on the table for your family in about 30 minutes--a territory already well covered by dozens of other (more useful) cookbooks.<br />In fact, the &quot;tips&quot; Anderson offers here are so basic as to be useless for almost anyone who knows anything about cooking (Hey, did you know that lettuce could be chopped instead of torn to save time? Or that vinegar and oil made a good salad dressing?) Anderson's advice is hardly revolutionary. And I just can't imagine anyone being that perplexed about how much lettuce needed, per person, per salad.<br />Of course, this book might be nice for someone who literally doesn't even know how to boil water, or thinks opening a can is equal to preparing dinner. The advice and tips given aren't bad, just painfully basic. If your cooking skills are already past the &quot;heating up a Lean Cuisine in the microwave&quot; stage I doubt you'll find much here that's of use.	2001-09-28

Though most Americans think of &quot;geisha&quot; as synonmous with &quot;prostitute,&quot; nothing could be farther from the truth. The women who lived the life of a &quot;Geisha&quot; were well-educated and highly sophisticated, a rarity for &quot;average&quot; woman in the stifiling confines of Japan's male dominated society.<br />The story of this real-life Geisha and her mentor is both touching and historically insightful. From her birth at the height of Geisha glory, through Japan's painful defeat in World War II, this story is a peek not only into the secret world of Geisha culture but also a look at what it means to be Japanese--something few Americans truly understand.<br />This beautifully-written book is a joy to read!	2001-09-28

In fact, at the risk of being lumped with the &quot;mindless masses&quot; (as I saw one reviewer term King fans) I'll even go so far as to say he's my favorite author. Yep, I'm well educated, appreciate Jane Austen and Henry James and love &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; and also think that Stephen King is a great writer. <br />An avid reader since age 5, I stumbled on King sometime in junior high. I can remember reading &quot;Salem's Lot&quot; alone in the house and actually getting the creeps (I was afraid to get up and close my open window for fear a vampire would be there, so I slept with my face to the wall)--something few novelists can achieve (you to have to be really &quot;into&quot; a story to forget it's &quot;just a book&quot;--and I think only a talented author can draw their readers in to that degree).<br />In high school I actually wrote a National Merit Scholar essay on King's &quot;The Body&quot; (the novella &quot;Stand by Me&quot; was based on) as an example of &quot;great literature&quot; and was lucky enough to have a teacher who was convinced by my arguments and let me do it. (Most other students did &quot;Grapes of Wrath,&quot; &quot;Moby Dick&quot; or &quot;War and Peace&quot;--I thought, and still do as a matter of fact, that great literature doesn't necessarily have to be dead boring. Even the review board that judged my paper appreciated my &quot;unique&quot; choice.)<br />To date, I've read everything King's ever written, minus a few magazine articles and have to say that, while I don't think they've all been gems, I've never tossed one down in boredom (and isn't entertainment why we read fiction in the first place?). <br />&quot;The Stand,&quot; which King himself has called his &quot;attempt at the great American novel,&quot; is my all time favorite. In the face of viral destruction of most of the US population, perpetrated upon us, of course, by our own government, only a handful of Americans are left alive. The story of these people, and their journey towards each other and towards creating a better world than the one decimated by flu, is truly spiritual--in a funky, Stephen King kind of way. And every page is worth reading. (Don't be scared shy readers, this is a long book that doesn't seem long. The story is good enough to carry you through all those pages.) There's a lot of &quot;deeper meaning&quot; in &quot;The Stand&quot; but it's also just a good, old fashioned adventure story that's a joy to read.<br />I think that &quot;book snobs&quot; and reluctant readers alike should give Stephen King a try. I mean, there's got to be some reason why the man is the must published fiction writer of all time.	2001-09-26

And, while I don't think he's in the same league as King, he continues to entertain me most of the time (which is all I'm really looking for when I sit down with a book).<br />&quot;Lightening&quot; remains my favorite Koontz work, and one of my all-time favorite, pure pleasure reads. It's definitely more of a thriller than a horror novel, though there is a bit of fantasy thrown in. &quot;Lightening&quot; won't change your life, but it's a great action-packed story with a super twist that perks up what could have been a typical action/thriller genre storyline.<br />A great beach book or perfect for a rainy day, &quot;Lightening&quot; will keep you involved and entertained.	2001-09-26

I was hoping for a male take on the standard romantic comedy, but thought Nicholas Weinstock's tale lacked both love and humor, not to mention any shred of believability.<br />I never really liked the main character, Oscar, and his &quot;poor me, put upon&quot; act doesn't really fly. From page two you're thinking: 'This guy is a drip! Why didn't he leave years ago?' You also have zero sympathy for his completely insane boss (and she become a successful publisher--which is all about dealing with people and making insightful decisions--how?) and couldn't care less if she married a giant creep or not. <br />Oscar's romantic lead, cynical journalist Lauren LaRose, and the stupid Harlequin-romancesque misunderstanding that keeps them apart for much of the book is equally insipid. Why Ms. La Rose never asked Oscar, whom she is supposedly falling in love with, a single straightforward question is never explained, nor is why Oscar feels compelled to lie to her to &quot;protect&quot; his dreadful boss's impending &quot;secret&quot; nuptials. (The book would have ended after the first chapter if he'd just gone, 'Look, don't tell anyone, but I'm really planning my boss's wedding.') And the ending, well, too stupid to be believed. (These people have never even dated and they're ... well, I won't spoil it, but it's very trite--the sort of ending not even suitable for a Lifetime Network movie.)<br />I didn't loathe &quot;As Long As She Needs Me&quot;--it's not the worst book I've ever read or anything, it's not even the worst book I read this month--but I did find myself rolling my eyes and saying &quot;Oh, please&quot; after almost every exchange of dialogue and plot development.	2001-09-26

I picked up &quot;Good in Bed&quot; thinking it would be another funny, cynical single woman looking for love and trying to get her life together book--and, don't get me wrong, I really enjoy those sort of books, despite being plenty cynical but no longer single--but author Jennifer Weiner's debut is a lot more than just another American version of Bridget Jones.<br />As with many first novels it's obvious that huge chunks of 28-year-old, somewhat overweight struggling journalist &quot;Candace Shapiro&quot; are taken straight from Weiner's own life. And the personal touch shows in the all-too-true writing, which draws you in and will make just about any woman sympathize with the often hapless &quot;Cannie,&quot; as her friends and former lovers know her.<br />Cannie's already shaky world is turned upside when former slacker flame Bruce turns up as a the newest columnist for trendy magazine &quot;Moxie,&quot; a &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; clone. Not only does Bruce's sudden success shock Cannie, a second-tier entertainment reporter at a Philly newspaper, but the fact that he's writing about their sex life, and Cannie's struggles with her weight, is far from helpful. I mean, wasn't her missing  missing-in-action louse of a father and the fairly recent discovery that her mother is in love with someone named &quot;Tanya&quot; enough to deal with?<br />As Weiner takes us into Cannie's life she makes everything from meeting (and befriending) a major movie star to dealing with the aftereffects of a misguided reunion, of sorts, with Bruce, eminently real and totally believable. Anyone who has ever struggled with weight, relationships, career and family--and that's everyone, isn't it?--will see pieces of themselves in Cannie. <br />Totally fun and deeply touching, Weiner is winner.

Fielding and Keyes make their slacker, angst-ridden characters fun and relate-able, Forrester, herself a former receptionist, follows the Fielding diary format but doesn't have any of the magic. You hate the whiney, no good character by page four and are forced to wade through a series of annoying symbols (look, the author discovered the font &quot;Wingdings&quot; on her computer and now we all must suffer) and acronyms. The entire book is practically written in code!<br />All that could be overlooked if you liked, cared or even laughed with any of the characters but the diary writer (I've forgotten her name, if I ever knew it) was thoroughly detestable and no one she wrote about worth knowing. The whole &quot;Man Who Mustn't be Mentioned&quot; mystery (her secret lover) takes up most of the book and, to be honest, I couldn't care less who he was or whether he ended up with what's-her-name.	2001-09-24

(&quot;High Fiedelty,&quot; the first one I read, was terrific, &quot;Fever Pitch&quot; was also very good and &quot;About a Boy&quot; was above average.) <br />The story centers around Dr. Katie Carr, a London liberal who is unhappily married to David, a house husband who writes a cynical newspaper column and putters about, occasionally working on a truly awful novel. Katie and David are a heartbeat from ending their 20 year marriage--in fact the book opens with Katie, who is dabbling in the waters of infiedlety, asking for a divorce over her mobile phone--and their kids, Tom and Molly, are choosing up sides. Then the mysterious DJ GoodNews, a &quot;spiritual healer&quot; enters their lives and, eventually, their home, making Katie question her own &quot;goodness&quot; and turning David from the &quot;Angriest Man in Holloway&quot; (the title of his newspaper column) into a liberal do-gooder who brings homeless teens home to live with them and gives away Sunday dinner to the less fortunate. Suddenly, though Katie has always wished David would &quot;lighten up,&quot; she finds herself wishing for her obnoxius husband back.<br />As the brief plot synopsis above may indicate this is an odd duck of a story. Hornby does the marriage stuff very well--making Katie a remarkably realistic disgruntled wife. Her wry wit and observations of marriage as jail will ring true (in an obviously exgaerrate satire) to most married folks and the commentary about liberal politics, versus liberal actions are also spot on. Unfortunately, the characters, while well drawn, don't follow a realistic path. (Why on Earth would Katie put up with all of David's outrageousness? Why would she let, first, the healer move in--and never leave--and then a homeless kid? It just doesn't track.) <br />Still, the book is well-written (styalistically) and quite funny in parts....	2001-09-22

As a longtime reader of cold war spy thrillers, I stumbled across &quot;The Moscow Club&quot; when it was first released in paperback in 1991. It's out of print now, but worth looking for.<br />This is, bar none, the best, most engrossing spy novel I've ever read. Not only is it brutally realistic and eerily prescient (it was written just months before the Soviet Union fell), it's also the most accurate representation of Soviet/Russian politics I've ever read, and I'm a former Soviet Studies major.<br />This is true can't-put-it-down novel. Intelligently written and probably a lot more real than we want to think--the concept that a few wealthy and powerful individuals really run the world isn't that far off--the fact that it was Joseph Finder's first novel is pretty impressive. His other books have been good, but nothing matches &quot;The Moscow Club,&quot; which is not only a non-stop thrill ride, but also the most intelligently-written political thriller I've ever picked up. Nothing Tom Clancey has written even comes close to the brilliance of Finder's &quot;Moscow Club.&quot; Don't miss it!	2001-09-17

The name Fannie Farmer is synonymous with good old-fashioned cooking and, in my opinion, &quot;The Fannie Farmer Baking Book&quot; is THE best baking cookbook available. I love to cook and tend to read cookbooks like novels, picking up tips and figuring out exactly which of the new recipes I'd like to try. When thumbing through &quot;The Fannie Farmer Baking Book&quot; I kept finding recipe after recipe that looked wonderful and learning all sorts of little hints that makes baking easier. <br />A lot of the recipes in this book are Fannie Farmer originals and have been appearing in various editions since the late 1800s. The reason these tried and true standards have stuck around so long is because they are truly wonderful.<br />&quot;The Fannie Farmer Baking Book&quot; is not only filled with great, old-fashioned cookie, cake and pie recipes it also features plenty of high-end desserts, all accompanied by step-by-step instructions on exactly how to make each and every item. It's easily the most complete and informative book on baking out there. Novice cooks and experienced bakers alike will gain a lot from this well-researched and informative tome!	2001-09-17

I stumbled upon Tabitha's novels while searching the library shelves for something of her husband's--since that fortuitous discover I've read all of the lesser-known King's novels and been completely entertained. In a style that differs totally from her husband's macabre touch, Tabitha seems to focus on character developing, creating real people that live in your mind for years after your read her stories. (I'm a HUGE Stephen King fan, having read everything he's ever written with the exception of a few magazine articles, but I can't say that his characters necessarily stick with me the same way as Tabitha's do.)<br />In &quot;One on One,&quot; the first Tabitha King novel I read, by the way, teenage jock Sam finds himself mysteriously attracted to, and ultimately sexually involved with, weird, gothic Deanie. A member of a very dysfunctional family, Deanie is part tough, dangerous chick and part incredibly vulnerable little girl. One thing that has always stuck with me about this book, which I read shortly after its 1994 release, is that I didn't really like either Sam, too wimpy, or Deanie, too disturbed, but I was entranced by their tale. This is one of those stay-up-all-night-and-finish-it-books--once you start Sam and Deanie's story, you'll have real trouble putting it down.<br />Since discovering Tabitha with &quot;One on One,&quot; I've become fan of all the King family writers. (For the record, while I've like many of Tabitha's other novels, I think &quot;One on One&quot; is her best effort.) I also admire Mrs. King for 1) publishing under own name, knowing the inevitable comparisons and envy (&quot;Gee, I wonder how SHE got a book deal?&quot;) that would result and 2) undertaking the struggle of writing at all. Goodness knows she didn't do it for the money!	2001-09-17

Sophia Kinsella is a utterly brilliant--or &quot;brill&quot; as a real Brit would say. In &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic,&quot; Kinsella has a created a loveable but looney character who is funnier than Bridget Jones (really). This is a truly stellar entry in what my husband teasingly refers to as the &quot;British Chick Book&quot; genre. <br />In the hapless Rebecca, Kinsella has created a laugh-out-loud funny heroine any clothes-loving, finance-challenged gal can relate to. (And who hasn't misused their Visa at least once or twice?) Of course, Rebecca's financial foibles come with a twist: she's actually a financial journalist, who deals with her own money woes by stuffing letters from the bank in her top drawer (out of sight, out of mind) and solid savings plans, such as winning the lottery.<br />&quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic&quot; is well-written and terrifically funny.

Many prefer this edition to the &quot;New Joy&quot; since it contains less fussy and more classic recipes. Personally, I have them both, and they each have their pros and cons (the &quot;New Joy&quot; finally takes into consideration some basis of healthful cooking, for instance, and drops some of the more antiquated appetizer and cocktail recipes). I also own the &quot;Joy of Cooking : A Compilation of Reliable Recipes With a Casual Culinary Chat,&quot; which is a word-for-word reproduction of Irma Rombaur's original, self-published edition of this cooking classic.

I was recently in a local [bookstore] and noticed it on the \\"New Fiction\\" bookshelf so I guessed, based on the popularity of Bridget, they've no released it in the States.<br />Now, don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad book and, if I hadn't first met Bridget, I might have liked Rosie Richardson, the TV producer turned end-world-hunger activist, a whole lot better. Fielding herself put it best, saying she thought \\"Cause Celeb\\" was a \\"better\\" book adding: \\"People criticize Bridget [for being shallow] but I wrote a book about a a serious issue (\\"Cause Celeb\\") and it made no money.\\" And, let's face it, people starving to death in Africa, even in front of minor British celebrities, isn't terribly humorous. <br />Though Fielding does her best and \\"Cause Celeb\\" is far from a bad book--there are some very funny moments--it just doesn't hold up to the side-splittingly funny and eminently relatable, for most woman, woes of Bridget: lumpy thighs, louse boyfriends and crap jobs.

Green doesn't have quite the same wit as a Marian Keyes, Helen Fielding, Jenny Colgan or Isabel Wolff--all great British romantic comedy authors whom I encourage everyone to check out--but she does produce entertaining &quot;set in London&quot; (albeit a London that seems way too &quot;American&quot; to me) tales about spunky female &quot;singletons&quot; searching for love.<br />Jemima Jones is fat, very fat. A wanna-be features writer at a crap paper, Jemima discovers the Internet and hooks up with hunky Los Angeles gym owner Brad, then sets about to transform herself into the model-thin PhotoShop-doctored photo she has sent him. And she's successful, going from 210+ to 120 pounds. <br />Anyone who has ever struggled with weight or love--and what woman hasn't?--will sympathize, at least in part, with Jemima. But I only gave this book three stars because it's impossible to totally like Jemima, as her choices are a little too bizarre, her sudden weight loss (100 pounds in six months) and transformation into a model-pretty, head-turning beauty no man can resist too utterly unreal and the entire plot far too predictable.<br />This book entertained me fairly well on a Sunday afternoon by the pool (I finished it in about six hours) but Green's &quot;Dear Reader&quot; style of writing (where the author often &quot;talks&quot; directly to the audience, leaving the characters in limbo) gets rather tedious by the end.	2001-09-10

I've now read about 90% of ... Books\\" and, while I don't always agree with Ms. Winfrey's taste, I continue to check out her picks because I have found some authors--most notably the spectacular Wally Lamb--I honestly respect, and most likely would not have otherwise discovered, thanks to ... super-popular \\"club.\\"<br />After reading \\"House of Sand and Fog\\" I'll be adding Andre Dubois III to my list of must-read authors. This book is completely unlike any of Oprah's other selections and, to be honest, unlike just about anything else I've ever read. (And I've read 3-5 books a week since I was five years old.) It's not an \\"easy read,\\" by any means--it's an undeniably emotionally powerful and thought-provoking story--but the suspense got me so hooked I finished this novel in less than a day. When I completed it and tried to describe it to my husband, who I thought would also enjoy it, he initially balked because it was an \\"Oprah Book.\\" Oprah, to him, equals \\"chick story.\\" And, while I admit that Oprah's choices do seem to favor stories of poor, disenfranchised or abused children (no surprise, since she can obviously relate to that), \\"House of Sand and Fog\\" is a notable exception. This is no \\"woman's story.\\"<br />After much racking of my brain I decided that this book most reminds me of Steinbeck's \\"Grapes of Wrath,\\" not because the stories are similar in any but the smallest and most superficial of ways, but because, like \\"Grapes of Wrath,\\" which starts off as such a straight-forward descriptive tale, you really never know where \\"House of Sand and Fog\\" is going. There are no \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" characters--all are terribly flawed--and the story takes a wealth of strange turns I NEVER would have seen coming. (In fact, the story is so distinctly \\"split\\" Dubois has divided the novel into \\"Part 1\\" and \\"Part 2.\\")<br />Becausethe novel is so incredibly unpredictable I won't offer much of a description here, for fear of spoiling it for others (WARNING: a few of the other reviews I've read do, I think, let on way too much). The story revolves around a Corona, California bungalow and the two very different families who have a claim on the house. The book begins with a detailed description of once-proud Iranian Colonel Behrani, who was forced out of his country after the Shah was overthrown. A proud man, steeped in the old Persian ways, Behrani, and his skittish wife, Nadri, are obsessed about keeping up the appearance that they have retained their status as \\"pooldar,\\" wealthy and influential members of the Persian community. The lengths Behrani goes to maintain this paper-thin illusion are both frightening and touching. (And the accuracy with which Dubois portrays this culture is incredible, considering he himself has no Persian ancestry, from what I understand.)<br />Recovering addict and alcoholic Kathy Nicolo is as different Behrani as night and day. The fact that their lives, and that of deputy Sheriff Lester, who has formed an instant, and life-changing, attachment to Kathy comes together at all is nothing short of shocking. (Again, that Dubois can so accurately depict a working class woman, since he himself is so obviously not one, is amazing.) Kathy cleans houses for a living, just barely keeping her head above water. She is uneducated, unmotivated and, for the most part, pretty unlikable. She watches endless movies in her free time and avoids problems, including the random departure of her second husband and the county's erroneous tax claim on her house. <br />At different times in the novel you may \\"side\\" with either Kathy or Behrani, but I have yet to talk to anyone who has read this book that fully liked either main character. (I'm more of a law and order gal myself, so, while I sympathized with Kathy's plight, I was more sympathetic to Behrani, overall.) And it's also impossible to truly like Lester, whose concern for Kathy may have been  perceived as touching, that is if he didn't have a wife and two kids at home.<br />\\"House of Sand and Fog\\" is a perfect \\"Book Club\\" book as, after reading it, you'll certainly want to discuss these indelible, if unlikable, characters with others. Their motivations and the shocking, yet somehow subdued, ending will certainly give you lots of conversational fodder.	2001-09-09

Freelance writer Clara is a mostly happy wife and mother. Sure she's put on a few pounds since her wedding day and her husband Robert is a little less enthusiastic in the bedroom and a lot less than helpful with the children, but they're mostly happy, right?

While there weren't a lot of suprises in this classically-ploted thriller, Illes keeps you entertained throughout this action-packed book, even if you can practically see the author imagining who would play his characters in the inevitable movie version. (In fact, it almost seems to be written with movie rights in mind--more screenplay, than novel.) Will Jennings is a successful doctor with the almost-perfect family, a loving wife, Karen, who loves her home and husband even if she does have regrets about having to drop out of medical school to get them, and a five-year-old daughter, Abby. He's also just invented a new drug that would take him from comfortable to astronomically wealthy. (Even though, judging by the author's rather over-eager descriptions of the doctor's possessions, he would already have to be a millionare several times over to afford the perfect house--Illes even raves about the top-of-the-line appliances--on an exclusive golf course in suburban Maryland, a private &quot;$300,000&quot; jet Jennings &quot;paid cash for,&quot; a high-dollar art collection and the cash reserves this book details. Doctors do well, no question, but few have private jets and can toss away $350,000 grand &quot;without even noticing,&quot; as the fictional Dr. Jennings claims he can.) While Will is at an annual medical convention, introducing his new wonder drug, Karen and Abby find themselves the victim of a ruthless kidnapper. Soon all three family members, all in seperate locales, are trapped in a nightmare with an experienced kidnapper who has already gotten away with this same crime on five previous occasions. But this time there's a few twists (of course): Abby has juvenille diabetes so the 24 hour plan the kidnapper insists they stick to could kill her and you soon learn that this time the kidnapper is after more than money. (Yep, &quot;this time it's personal.&quot;) And, of course, smart, but not TOO smart, kidnapper Joe Hickey didn't depend on the resoursefulness of the Jennings family (Abby is the most literate and self-composed five year old in history) who go on a rampage (leaving a wreckage of vehicles and other possessions, as well as a body count, in their wake) in order to avoid what has been the inevitable for all of Hickey's previous victims. This book won't change your life, or throw you many curves (Hmm, whom do you think will triumph, the good guy or the bad guy?) and offers the obligatory over-the-top chase sequence (involving that plane I mentioned earlier) and last-second vanquishing of the bad guy via an unexpected source, but there are worse ways you can spend a Sunday afternoon.	2001-08-27

Soon the sheriff is at Ford's door and the quiet little town of Monroe will never be the same. Can a bad man become good? Or has Ethan/Byron simply been pretending to be a local hero and model father for the past 15 years? Ford's friends and family struggle with these questions in &quot;Blue Diary,&quot; which is not a murder mystery (Ford quickly confesses) or courtroom drama (the book ends before the trial even begins), but instead a probe into every day human nature. &quot;Blue Diary&quot; also takes Hoffman's unique narrative style (writing each chapter from a different character's perspective) to a new level, as she tells the story in the voice of at least nine of the novel's main characters. The premise that drives the plot is an intriguing one, but the schizophrenic nature of the book makes it hard to get interested in the story line, or get to know the characters, until you're at least halfway through the story. That having been said, I remain a fan of Hoffman's work and, while &quot;Blue Diary&quot; probably isn't for everyone, and isn't my favorite Hoffman novel (that would be &quot;Here on Earth&quot;), it's another unique and interesting tale from this talented author.	2001-08-26

I have read at least three books (often more) a week since I was five and in my 20-odd years as a reader I have found just a handful of authors I love so much I'd read the back of a cereal box if they wrote it. Wally Lamb is one of those authors. I started &quot;She's Come Undone&quot; on a plane and was so engrossed that I couldn't stop reading even when I'd reached my destination. I literally walked through the airport reading this book and didn't stop until I got to the end (I was safely in my hotel room by that time). It's been several years now since I've read the book, but it still sticks with me. (With many titles, you could ask me next week and I wouldn't even remember the main character's name.) I think that only a really great author has the ability to make a reader care about a character that is, to say the least, less than perfect. Lamb so draws you into the life of overweight, dreadfully unhappy Dolores Price, you care completely about what happens to her, even if you frequently don't like her very much. I won't give anything about this completely unique story away, but suffice to say it's not just another &quot;fat girl makes good&quot; tale. The biggest shock for me when I sat down to read Lamb's follow-up book, &quot;I Know This Much Is True,&quot; which was also magnificent by the way, was seeing the author's photo. After reading &quot;She's Come Undone&quot; I was POSITIVE that &quot;Wally&quot; was a woman, despite the obviously masculine name. I mean, how could any man so perfectly personify that uniquely feminine struggle with beauty, weight and acceptance? Lamb is a genius. No question about it.	2001-08-24

I was at Heathrow, needed something to read and picked up &quot;The Last Chance Saloon,&quot; which was on a best seller rack. What a find! Keyes is one of those rare &quot;laugh out loud&quot; authors. The zany inhabitants of &quot;Last Chance Saloon&quot; entertained me throughout my five hour flight home and I instantly wanted more. Unfortunately Keyes, a hit in Britain, is only just now getting her just due in this country and her books can be hard to find. (They are released first in Britain.) Keyes so perfectly captures the existence of a single British gal heading into the 20th Century. I would be surprised if ultra-popular Bridgett Jones Diary author Helen Fielding wasn't influenced by Keyes, as their tone and style are quite similar. (I've discovered that British single woman comedies are an entire genre in popular fiction.) My only complaint is that I can't find any more Keyes books to read!	2001-08-24

I continue to read many of the queen of talk show's recommendations because she has led me to some of my favorite books, and introduced to me authors, for example Wally Lamb, whom I probably wouldn't have discovered without Ms. Winfrey's encouragement. &quot;Cane River&quot; is another one of those &quot;Oprah Books&quot; I can easily recommend. It's a great read which is also great history. An intriguing &quot;based on a true story&quot; novel, this story details the struggle of a Southern family as they transform from slave, to Negro to Colored. (The tale ends before they hit Black or African-American.) As a non-African American, this book was a real insight for me into the racism that lives within racism. Sure, I knew that the South was hardly a bastion of political correctness, but I was basically ignorant of the social standing based on skin color that lived (and likely still exists to some extent) within the black community. It's not only a story about color, it's also a story about women's place in society. Real women, not the wealthy, privileged elite. &quot;Cane River,&quot; written by a former female CEO of a Fortune 500 company, puts into perspective just how far we've come as a society, and how far we have yet to go. It also lends hope that, with each succeeding generation, progress is, in fact, made, even though it's sometimes hard to see until you step back and look at the big picture. And, yeah, the fact that Lalita Tademy, the great-great granddaughter (I think that's right), of a slave can become a corporate bigwig IS the big picture.	2001-08-24

(One of many drawbacks is that 2 lb. recipes are nonexistent, as 2 lb. machines didn't exist when that book was written, plus lots of model-specific advice is given for models that no longer exist.) &quot;More Bread Machine Magic,&quot; published in 1999, remedies that somewhat by steering clear of maker-specific information and adding 2 lb. versions to every recipe. There are a lot of interesting recipes in here and the few I've tried have turned out fairly well, but I can't say that this book breaks too much new ground. If you already like and use your bread machine frequently, you probably already have a lot of these recipes (and the ones you don't, you might not want). But, if you're looking to add usefulness to a bread machine that's just gathering dust on your countertop, this volume will probably provide a lot of new ideas for you. I would warn though, that most (all?) of the best recipes in this book are &quot;dough,&quot; recipes, i.e. not cooked in the machine. Conway and her partner have gone the route of most &quot;serious&quot; cooks and turned their machines into kneading and proofing boxes, instead of all-in-one ovens. That doesn't make these recipes bad--in fact I think that mixing and kneading is a great use for a bread machine--I just wanted to warn those who want to throw some ingredients in a machine, walk away and return to hot, baked bread that this book might not be for you.	2001-08-24

Most of the models listed are no longer made (or, if they are, are radically different) so few of the suggestions for use have any meaning. It also means that these recipes were not tested on the new, more high tech breadmakers of today, requiring slight adjustments in almost all the amounts and rendering the &quot;advice&quot; and &quot;how to cook&quot; chapters all but irrelevant. A big drawback is that 2 lb. recipes are nonexistent, as 2 lb. machines didn't exist when this book was written.<br />This isn't necessarily a bad book, but if you're looking for a good bread machine cookbook I'd recommend skipping this outdated volume and instead choosing &quot;More Bread Machine Magic,&quot; which was released in 1999.	2001-08-24

While I haven't been a fan of every &quot;Oprah Book Club&quot; selection I continue to read many of the queen of talk show's recommendations for one reason: She led me to Wally Lamb. I have read at least three books (often more) a week since I was five and in my 20-odd years as a reader I have found just a handful of authors I love so much I'd read the back of a cereal box if they wrote it. Wally Lamb is one of those authors. I started his first novel, &quot;She's Come Undone,&quot; on a plane and was so engrossed that I couldn't stop reading even when I'd reached my destination. I literally walked through the airport reading this book and didn't stop until I got to the end (I was safely in my hotel room by that time). It's been several years now since I've read the book, but it still sticks with me. (With many titles, you could ask me next week and I wouldn't even remember the main character's name.) Lamb so nailed the uniquely feminine struggle with beauty, weight and acceptance I was certain Mr. Lamb was a she. So, well before Oprah put her stamp of approval on Lamb's second novel, &quot;I Know This Much Is True,&quot; I was dying to read it. My first shock was the author photo--Wally Lamb was obviously a man. The second was how totally different, yet equally compelling this book was when compared to &quot;She's Come Undone.&quot; The fact that this novel was amazingly well written and deals with an incredibly emotional subject are basically the only similarities between the books. Their pace, tone and style are so completely different I could have never guessed that they were written by the same person. &quot;I Know This Much Is True&quot; asks an intriguing question: How can family members be so different and how strong are the ties of blood. This is the story of identical twins, one normal, one a paranoid schizophrenic. This book grabs you on the first page and never lets go, twisting your emotions this way and that throughout the story and making you question just about every hardcore belief you've ever had. Lamb is such a good writer you tend to feel emotionally drained after reading one of his novels--that's how real his characters are. Lamb is a genius; no question about it.	2001-08-24

I also never fail to learn something from their informative kitchen commentary. All in all, his recipes and advice are beneficial to both novice and experienced cooks.<br />That having been I have to point out that taste is, of course, subjective. For instance, I've found, from trying a number of Kimball's recipes, that he is a salt-a-holic. I prefer to cook with little or no salt, as I find the taste harsh and unpleasant, and if I followed Kimball's recipes exactly I'd be drowning in the stuff. I prefer pepper and tend to double or triple the often meager amounts Kimball calls for in his recipes (usually he calls for four or fives times more salt than pepper, and I tend to reverse those ratios).<br />The recommendations too, are, of course, all one man's opinion. He speaks harshly of Le Creuset, which is my favorite cookware, despite the expense (don't listen to Kimball: the enamel service is as good or better than non-stick), and frequently raves about plain cast iron which, while I'm sure can be great, takes a great deal of patience to properly season (I've NEVER had any luck doing so), can't be washed in a dishwasher (big downfall, in my opinion) and can easily destroy an induction cooktop (something Kimball fails to even mention). <br />All of Kimball's cookbooks follow the same basic format: a long-winded, but often interesting, discourse on how Kimball views the &quot;perfect&quot; version of whatever it is he's showing you how to cook, including a lengthy explanation of variations he has tried, followed by his &quot;Master Recipe&quot; for the food. I recommend carefully reading the introduction, focusing on what Kimball considers &quot;perfection,&quot; before attempting the recipe, because whether you agree with Kimball's definition of &quot;perfection&quot; is very important as whether this recipe will be a hit with your or not. <br />In short, if your taste is the same as Kimball's when it comes to a particular food his well-researched and thoroughly-tested recipes will be amazing. But if you don't feel the same way, the &quot;master recipe&quot; won't really work for you. For instance, I like my cookies more &quot;blonde&quot; and chewy than Kimball and his team, so his cooking times/methods aren't exactly to my specifications.<br />But my biggest problem with Kimball cookbooks is this: If you have one, you have them all. He lifts whole passages and recipes and uses them in multiple books. &quot;The Yellow Farmhouse Cookbook,&quot; and the &quot;Cook's Bible,&quot; for instance, have at least 50 identical recipes, not to mention verbatim introductions to each section and cookware recommendations repeated word-for-word. &quot;The Best Recipe&quot; features ALL of the recipes (as far as I can tell) from the &quot;Cook's Bible,&quot; with the same commentary, which is, in turn, lifted in whole chunks from past issues of &quot;Cooks Illustrated.&quot; I'm sure this saves Mr. Kimball a great deal of time when compiling his cookbooks but it leaves little reason to own more than one edition of his work. The &quot;Dessert Bible&quot; follows this same somewhat annoying pattern, featuring duplicates of basically every recipe in the &quot;Cook's Bible&quot; and &quot;The Best Recipe.&quot; I'd say at least half, maybe more, of the recipes are duplicates--something you should be aware of, especially if you already own one or both of the above cookbooks, before you buy.<br />That having been said, the &quot;Dessert Bible&quot; does expand enough on Kimball's earlier works for me to recommend it to cooks with serious sweet toohs. Occasional kitchen goers would probably be better served with &quot;The Best Recipe,&quot; Kimball's best cookbook to date.	2001-08-22

I bought this little book recently and discovered that the Cook's Illustrated team has come up with, bar none, the best homemade ice cream recipe on Earth. The taste is so rich and creamy, you'll think you're eating at the world's best ice cream parlor, not in your own kitchen. Their recipe is far more time consuming than most (be sure you've got a fine mesh strainer, high quality heavy saucepan and digital thermometer on hand), but it's worth it to produce ice cream this good!<br />We've got a Simac Gelatio Magnum, which this book incidentally calls &quot;The Rolls Royce&quot; of home ice cream makers, and the ice cream we made with it in the past had been good, but not as rich or creamy as the store-bought stuff. But combine the Simac, or any other high quality maker, with this book and you'll have the best ice cream you ever tasted!<br />My only complaint is that there are no variations from the &quot;Master Recipe&quot; that provide for a lighter, or quicker version. The ice cream produced by this recipe is ultra-rich, and sometimes a more simple, cooling treat is what you're looking for. For that I recommend &quot;Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream and Dessert Book&quot; which contains a passable &quot;sweet cream base&quot; recipe that can be whipped up in less than five minutes.	2001-08-21

I also never fail to learn something from their informative kitchen commentary, including kitchenware recommendations. All in all, his recipes and advice are beneficial to both novice and experienced cooks.<br />That having been I have to point out that taste is, of course, subjective. For instance, I've found, from trying a number of Kimball's recipes, that he is a salt-a-holic. I prefer to cook with little or no salt, as I find the taste harsh and unpleasant, and if I followed Kimbell's recipes exactly I'd be drowning in the stuff. I prefer pepper and tend to double or triple the often meager amounts Kimbell calls for in his recipes (usually he calls for four or fives times more salt than pepper, and I tend to reverse those ratios).<br />The recommendations too, are, of course, all one man's opinion. He speaks harshly of Le Creuset, which is my favorite cookware, despite the expense (don't listen to Kimball: the enamel service is as good or better than non-stick), and frequently raves about plain cast iron which, while I'm sure can be great, takes a great deal of patience to properly season (I've NEVER had any luck doing so), can't be washed in a dishwasher (big downfall, in my opinion) and can easily destroy an induction cooktop (something Kimball fails to even mention). He also highly recommends an electric rice cooker which is, perhaps, the least useful tool in my kitchen and is quite scornful of breadmakers, an appliance I use several times a week quite happily.<br />All of Kimball's cookbooks follow the same basic format: a long-winded, but often interesting, discourse on how Kimball views the &quot;perfect&quot; version of whatever it is he's showing you how to cook, including a lengthy explanation of variations he has tried, followed by his &quot;Master Recipe&quot; for the food. I recommend carefully reading the introduction, focusing on what Kimball considers &quot;perfection,&quot; before attempting the recipe. For instance, he prefers very hard, extremely crusty bread (one of the main reasons he despises breadmakers, by the way) with a light, &quot;air-filled&quot; interior, while I like a soft, almost blonde, crust and am quite fond of the &quot;cakelike&quot; bread consistency Kimball is so disdainful of. So, in terms of bread, Kimball's &quot;master&quot; recipe is obviously not going to suit me.<br />In short, if your taste is the same as Kimball's when it comes to a particular food his well-researched and thoroughly-tested recipes will be amazing. If you don't feel the same way about, say, chicken (he likes it quite salty and greasy--though he uses the terms like &quot;savory,&quot; &quot;succulent&quot; and &quot;moist&quot; to describe what I think of as &quot;salty&quot; and &quot;greasy&quot;) as the author, his recipe for roasting a chicken will leave you cold.<br />The other caveat to keep in mind when purchasing Kimball's books is that many, most notably the &quot;Cook's Bible,&quot; are extremely outdated (far more so than they should be, judging by the publication date), particularly when it comes to appliance and cookware recommendations. (Often the products he has tested either no longer are made or have been radically changed, and the ones he panned are now considerably better.) For instance, Kimball frequently talks about the &quot;rarity&quot; of a kitchen which contains both a food processor and a stand mixer while I'd say at least half the wives I know have both, and quotes bread machines as costing &quot;upwards of $300.&quot; (There's also a rather long and ludicrious section where he goes into great deal about how &quot;most&quot; people who own a stand mixer &quot;only have a whip attachment&quot; when KitchenAid, and other popular models,have been including dough hooks and paddles, as well as whips, as standard equipment for at least the last 15 years.) Kimball also terms ceramic cooktops &quot;experimental&quot; though they are actually quite common now. (Off the top of my head I can think of a dozen people I know who cook on induction or ceramic ranges.) In addition, he completely ignores the Internet when giving out reccomendations of where to purchase certain items. (Most of the things he says you need can be easily found online.) In addition, he says you can buy a top-of-the-line Wusthof Trident chef's knife for &quot;around $85,&quot; when in fact the knife he reccomends now costs well over $100. I could go on, but I think you get the point: Listen to Kimball's advice, but don't always take it as hard fact.<br />But my biggest problem with Kimbell cookbooks is this: If you have one, you have them all. He lifts whole passages and recipes and uses them in multiple books. &quot;The Yellow Farmhouse Cookbook,&quot; and the &quot;Cook's Bible,&quot; for instance, have at least 50 identical recipes, not to mention verbatim introductions to each section and cookware reccomendations repeated word-for-word. &quot;The Best Recipe&quot; features ALL of the recipes (as far as I can tell) from the &quot;Cook's Bible,&quot; with the same commentary, which is, in turn, lifted in whole chunks from past issues of &quot;Cooks Illustrated.&quot; I'm sure this saves Mr. Kimbell a great deal of time when compiling his cookbooks but it leaves little reason to own more than one edition of his work. Exceptions to this rule are his specality cookbooks, such as his &quot;Complete Pasta and Noodle&quot; or &quot;Complete Poultry,&quot; which again contain exact repeats from other books but also add a wealth of new recipes and information.<br />If you're going to buy a Kimbell cookbook, and I do think it's a worthy investment for any semi-serious cook, buy his latest (for example, &quot;The Best Recipe,&quot; in lieu of&quot;The Cook's Bible&quot;), whatever that may be. That way, you're sure to get 90% of what's contained in earlier versions, without paying for &quot;repeats.&quot; On the other hand, if you already own, say, &quot;The Cook's Bible,&quot; don't bother with &quot;The Yellow Farmhouse Cookbook&quot; or the &quot;The Best Recipe.&quot; In addition, as mentioned earlier, Kimbell's speciality cookbooks, focusing on one particular item, are also worth the purchase price, but only if you're interested in that particular food type.	2001-08-05

They are standard-bound hardcover editions that rarely lie flat (the latest, &quot;The Best Recipe,&quot; is a little better than the others) and the index is dreadful--a fairly major gripe when you consider how important an index is to a cookbook when, say, you quickly want to find a recipe for &quot;Chicken Soup&quot; and you can't even decipher where the &quot;Cs&quot; start! There may be six or seven pages under the tiny heading &quot;entrees,&quot; five of which may start with &quot;chicken,&quot; leading you to believe you're in the &quot;Cs&quot; when you're actually in the &quot;Es.&quot; It's very confusing. Many other people have recommended putting dictionary like letter headers (for example &quot;CHI-CLA&quot;) at the top of each index page and, after trying it, I have to say I highly recommend this method.<br />All of Kimball's &quot;Cook's Illustrated&quot; cookbooks follow the same basic format: a long-winded, but often interesting, discourse on how Kimball views the &quot;perfect&quot; version of whatever it is he's showing you how to cook, including a lengthy explanation of variations he has tried, followed by his &quot;Master Recipe&quot; for the food, including common variations. In &quot;The Complete Book of Pasta and Noodles,&quot; Kimball covers everything from homemade pasta (surprisingly, he doesn't stress it's necessity, saying dried pasta is almost as good and a whole lot easier) to every type of sauce and other topping--Italian, Chinese, Mediterranean, etc.--imaginable.<br />Usually my biggest problem with Kimball cookbooks is this: If you have one, you have them all.

I still prefer the latter method and use either apple cider or white vinegar--half water, half vinegar--with great success and no salty after taste.)<br />All of Kimball's &quot;Cook's Illustrated&quot; cookbooks follow the same basic format: a long-winded, but often interesting, discourse on how Kimball views the &quot;perfect&quot; version of whatever it is he's showing you how to cook, including a lengthy explanation of variations he has tried, followed by his &quot;Master Recipe&quot; for the food. I recommend carefully reading this introduction, focusing on what Kimball considers &quot;perfection,&quot; before attempting the recipe. If you don't feel the same way about, say, roast chicken as the author, his &quot;master recipe&quot; for roasting a chicken will leave you cold (he likes it quite salty and greasy--though he uses  terms like &quot;savory,&quot; &quot;succulent&quot; and &quot;moist&quot; to describe what I think of as &quot;salty&quot; and &quot;greasy&quot;). But this can all be easily adapted to create a brilliant chicken you will love. In short, the basics are all there, you just may have to fiddle with the seasonings.<br />I must also warn cooks that Kimball's cookbooks are books not necessarily made for cooking (odd, isn't it?). They are standard-bound hardcover editions that rarely lie flat (the latest, &quot;The Best Recipe,&quot; is a little better than the others) and the index is dreadful--a fairly major gripe when you consider how important an index is to a cookbook when, say, you quickly want to find a recipe for &quot;Chicken Soup&quot; and you can't even decipher where the &quot;Cs&quot; start! There may be six or seven pages under the tiny heading &quot;entrees,&quot; five of which may start with &quot;chicken,&quot; leading you to believe you're in the &quot;Cs&quot; when you're actually in the &quot;Es.&quot; It's very confusing. Many other people have recommended putting dictionary like letter headers (for example &quot;CHI-CLA&quot;) at the top of each index page and, after trying it, I have to say I highly recommend this method.<br />Usually my biggest problem with Kimbell cookbooks is this: If you have one, you have them all. He lifts whole passages and recipes and uses them in multiple books. &quot;The Yellow Farmhouse Cookbook,&quot; and the &quot;Cook's Bible,&quot; for instance, have at least 50 identical recipes, not to mention verbatim introductions to each section and cookware recommendations repeated word-for-word. &quot;The Best Recipe&quot; features ALL of the recipes (as far as I can tell) from the &quot;Cook's Bible,&quot; with the same commentary, which is, in turn, lifted in whole chunks from past issues of &quot;Cooks Illustrated.&quot; I'm sure this saves Mr. Kimbell a great deal of time when compiling his cookbooks but it leaves little reason to own more than one edition of his work. The &quot;Complete Poultry&quot; cookbook though, is an exception to this rule. While it does contain exact repeats from other books, it also add a wealth of new recipes and information, making it more than worth your while for anyone who cooks poultry regularly.<br />While I wouldn't take his meat recommendations too seriously--I'd say that most of us can't REALLY tell the difference between a $90 special-order free range turkey and a $15 Butterball (I did try both and it's not worth the cost)--Kimball's recipes will help you make the best Thanksgiving dinner ever and help answer that near nightly question: 'What on Earth am I going to do with these boneless, skinless chicken breasts this time?'	2001-08-05

I also never fail to learn something from their informative kitchen commentary. All in all, his recipes and advice are beneficial to both novice and experienced cooks.<br />That having been I have to point out that taste is, of course, subjective. For instance, I've found, from trying a number of Kimball's recipes, that he is a salt-a-holic. I prefer to cook with little or no salt, as I find the taste harsh and unpleasant, and if I followed Kimbell's recipes exactly I'd be drowning in the stuff. I prefer pepper and tend to double or triple the often meager amounts Kimbell calls for in his recipes (usually he calls for four or fives times more salt than pepper, and I tend to reverse those ratios).<br />The recommendations too, are, of course, all one man's opinion. He speaks harshly of Le Creuset, which is my favorite cookware, despite the expense (don't listen to Kimball: the enamel service is as good or better than non-stick), and frequently raves about plain cast iron which, while I'm sure can be great, takes a great deal of patience to properly season (I've NEVER had any luck doing so), can't be washed in a dishwasher (big downfall, in my opinion) and can easily destroy an induction cooktop (something Kimball fails to even mention). He also highly recommends an electric rice cooker which is, perhaps, the least useful tool in my kitchen and is quite scornful of breadmakers, an appliance I use several times a week quite happily.<br />All of Kimball's cookbooks follow the same basic format: a long-winded, but often interesting, discourse on how Kimball views the &quot;perfect&quot; version of whatever it is he's showing you how to cook, including a lengthy explanation of variations he has tried, followed by his &quot;Master Recipe&quot; for the food. I recommend carefully reading the introduction, focusing on what Kimball considers &quot;perfection,&quot; before attempting the recipe. For instance, he prefers very hard, extremely crusty bread (one of the main reasons he despises breadmakers, by the way) with a light, &quot;air-filled&quot; interior, while I like a soft, almost blonde, crust and am quite fond of the &quot;cakelike&quot; bread consistency Kimball is so disdainful of. So, in terms of bread, Kimball's &quot;master&quot; recipe is obviously not going to suit me.<br />In short, if your taste is the same as Kimball's when it comes to a particular food his well-researched and thoroughly-tested recipes will be amazing. If you don't feel the same way about, say, chicken (he likes it quite salty and greasy--though he uses the terms like &quot;savory,&quot; &quot;succulent&quot; and &quot;moist&quot; to describe what I think of as &quot;salty&quot; and &quot;greasy&quot;) as the author, his recipe for roasting a chicken will leave you cold.<br />But my biggest problem with Kimbell cookbooks is this: If you have one, you have them all.

Exceptions to this rule are his specialty cookbooks, such as his &quot;Complete Pasta and Noodle&quot; or &quot;Complete Poultry,&quot; which again contain exact repeats from other books but also add a wealth of new recipes and information.<br />If you're going to buy a Kimbell cookbook, and I do think it's a worthy investment for any semi-serious cook, buy &quot;The Best Recipe&quot; which is the most complete and contains a minimum of what I feel are Mr. Kimball's fairly useless opinions on cookware and appliances. On the other hand, if you already own, say, &quot;The Cook's Bible,&quot; don't bother with &quot;The Best Recipe.&quot; In addition, as mentioned earlier, Kimbell's specialty cookbooks, focusing on one particular item, are also worth the purchase price, but only if you're interested in that particular food type.	2001-08-05

We recently purchased a high-end electric ice cream maker (the Simac &quot;Gelatio Magnum&quot;) and, along with it, the Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream Book; we're in love with both products! Ben and Jerry share the recipes for all of their best flavors--including chocolate chip cookie dough and Heath Bar crunch--plus tell you their own story and &quot;ice cream philosophy.&quot; It's a fun cookbook with plenty of practical tips. <br />So far we've made six or seven of the recipes, including the French Vanilla (not as rich as I'd like), Strawberry Banana (wonderful, but add an extra banana) and Orange Dream (our favorite). Their sweet cream base is extremely easy to make--it takes about 15 seconds--but if you prefer a richer, more creamy consistency, look for a cooked &quot;custard&quot;-style receipe.	2001-07-30
