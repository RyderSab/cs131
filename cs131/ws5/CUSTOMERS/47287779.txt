He lists numerous scriptual passages to be used in combatting different types of diseases and conditions. His prescription requires that these bible verses be spoken at least two or three times daily. If the condition worsens, he advises us to double our efforts. <br /> <br />Capps' little booklet is clearly written. His message is not really unique since it is similar to the approaches to healing advocated by Kenneth Hagin, Jim Glennon, Ralph C. Brittain, Dodie Osteen and many others.	2005-04-24

Funk believes that the Jesus of the gospels is an enigma to many Christians because he seems to belong to an alien time and space.<br />One of the more interesting facets of HONEST TO JESUS is the author's discussion of his own perception of Jesus. In the view of Funk, Jesus deprives all people of entitlements and special priviledges which separate them into categories. Jesus also preaches that all rewards and punishments are intrinsic and not something we can expect to receive from God either now or later. Jesus has a very different view of the world because he can see things other people do not see. For this reason he is considered to be demented by many including some members of his own family.	2003-05-18

His arguments are sometimes persuasive but when he starts to predict how the new Christianity will look after his second reformation, his ideas become less convincing.

He does, however, have a much different view of the origins and development of the Bible which make it impossible for him to accept the idea that it contains the inerrant word of God.<br />The writers of the Bible knew nothing about dinosaurs or cave dwellers. They thought that the earth was flat and that it was created in 4000 B.C.E.<br />Scholars date the earliest written material from the Old Testament back only to the period after David. This means that the stories about Moses were probably written at least three hundred years after the death of Moses.<br />Several separate strands of Biblical narration have been identified. Scholars have referred to these traditions as J(Y), E, D and P and these were all later merged into one version.<br />As for the New Testament it should be noted that no gospel had been written by the time Paul died about thirty years after the crucifixion.<br />The Book of Acts was written about twenty or more years after Paul's death. Paul's conversion on the Road to Damascus was described fully in Acts but never by Paul himself in his letters.<br />Most of what we know about Jesus comes from the gospels which were written much later. Mark was the earliest gospel and it was produced about twenty-five or thirty years after Christ's crucifixion. John's gospel was the last gospel and it was written about 100 C.E.<br />Spong believes that words cannot capture Christ. They can only point to Christ. Spong worships the God he meets in Jesus and in worshipping he tries to risk love, dare to live and have the courage to be himself.	2003-04-15

This theory contends that the first five books of the Bible are based on four major source documents which have never been found. These sources are hidden in the text of the Bible but most serious biblical scholars recognize their existence.For  purposes of identification they are referred to as J, E, P and D.<br />Each was the product of an evolutionary process over centuries and all were finally integrated into a single narrative.<br />The J source probably originated as early as the ninth or tenth century B.C.E. - perhaps in the time of David or later. God was here referred to as Jahweh. This God interacted with humanity. In the E source God was referred to as Elohim. The P source was concerned mostly with rituals as well as precise dating, numbers and measurements. At some time J and E became a single narrative and after the fall of Israel D was introduced sometime around 700 B.C.E. The D source was named after Deuteronomy and it reflected the reformist view of King Josiah.<br />There are other sources of the Bible that Greenberg describes as non-biblical books. An example of such a source is the Book of Jasher which is mentioned in the Bible in Joshua 10:13 and 2 Samuel 1:18.<br />In addition to the above sources writers of the Bible often used records of the monarchies. Of course they also relied on myths and legends of the Middle East.<br />Most of 101 MYTHS OF THE BIBLE is devoted to a discussion of individual myths. Examples of the myths are such favorite Bible beliefs as Cain kiled Abel or the rain lasted forty days and forty nights.<br />101 MYTHS OF THE BIBLE is a fascinating book which includes a lot of dense material. It is not an easy read but the author does make an effort to produce a very understandable text for the ordinary Bible enthusiast.	2003-03-21

In this book Spong continues to proclaim the death of theism while calling for a radical new reformation.<br />The most exciting part of A NEW CHRISTIANITY FOR A NEW WORLD is the author's description of his initial introduction to the historical Jesus and how that meeting inspires him to embark on a fresh pilgrimage.<br />Jesus is now mediating to Spong in such a forceful and authoritative way that he is still able to call Jesus his Lord and himself a Christian. The author finds Jesus to be more thoroughly alive than previously imagined. The main message of Jesus summons us to a Kingdom of God here on earth. This is a level of being where we are able to break down the barriers that separate us from others due to our prejudices. All such tribal fears tend to diminish our humanity.<br />I find this book uplifting on the one hand and at the same time unsettling since it is very unclear just exactly where the new reformation will lead us. I sure hope it is not the desert.	2003-01-23

It was also not unusual for farmers to employ servants as was the case with both the Earnshaws and the Lintons in this story.

For instance, besides the romance between Jane and Edward there is also the contrast provided by the relationship between Jane and St. John.<br />Imagine what may happen if Jane accepts the marriage proposal of St. John and goes with him to some foreign land as the wife of a missionary? In answering that question while taking a closer look at the unfeeling St. John, we  see an anti-Christian message in the book. Add to this mix the despicable Mr. Brocklehurst, the school manager who is also minister of Brocklebridge Church, and you receive a very negative view of Christianity. JANE EYRE is a love story with an anti-Christian bias - but the theme proclaiming that love can conquer all is still the dominant message of the novel.<br />The above represents only one perspective. The book of course can be read and interpreted from many other vantage points. For me that is its greatest strength and enjoyment.	2002-11-21

He is referring to Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity and Islam. In all of these religions it is taught that the world was made by God. The creator is God and the creature is the world. The world and God are not the same. In these religions the Divine is not within the individual.<br />In the Christian tradition Jesus is regarded as the one true God-and-true-man and the only incarnation on earth of the Godhead. In Buddhism, however, the Buddha is seen as a model through which the incarnation is experienced within oneself. Similar beliefs are also present in other religions of the Orient.<br />THOU ART THAT is a useful introduction to the work of Joseph Campbell.

The sacred is not somewhere else. God is always in relationship to us and journeying with us. God yearns to be known by us.<br />The closing chapters resemble an instruction manual on how to open up to God. Borg includes here a clear vision of what we can expect from our own pilgimage with Jesus. This is what sets the author apart from most of the other Jesus Seminar scholars. Borg goes beyond the reconstruction of the historical Jesus to emphasize the rewards of seeking a relationship with the living God.The author suggests that the Christian life is about opening the heart now to the God who is already here. It is about entering into a relationship with God in the present that begins to change everything now.	2002-08-01

Both men agree that 'the gospels combine historical material with metaphorical significance' but disagree on how much of the material is history remembered. Borg emphasizes that the gospels are heavily influenced by the theology of the developing Christian tradition during the last part of the first century and consequently gives greater weight to the gospel layers he identifies as being written earlier. I am probably more sympathetic to the traditional view of Jesus as put forth by N.T. Wright. However, Borg seems to do a better job of defending his position.	2001-12-24

Borg believes that the images of Jesus in the synoptic gospels are very different from that presented in the Gospel of John. Since John's Gospel was written at a much later date, he argues that the Johannine image of Jesus is nonhistorical. For the development of the historical Jesus, Borg relies on the early layers of Matthew, Mark and Luke as well as the Gospel of Thomas which was discovered in Egypt in 1945. There is much more to this book than just a discussion of the historical Jesus. However, for anybody seeking a highly readable introduction to the subject, Borg's description in the second chapter of his own quest for the historical Jesus will be very useful.	2001-12-06

The author gives us an orientation to prayer based on Matthew 6:9-13. His guidelines include making a shift in our praying from simple supplication to a much broader relationship with God. This is possible if we increase our daily study of the Bible, make prayer a priority and above all find that special place where we can pray in secret. Our model for the practice of praying in secret is Jesus Christ Himself.<br />The formula put forth by Hanegraaff sounds simple but I am sure it is not easy to successfully follow.

In the first one God disciplines us to remove sin and in the next season  God does some pruning to allow us to better order our priorities. In the third one we will be invited by God to abide more deeply with Him.<br />The author shows us how to recognize which season we are presently in and how to get the most out of it. The lessons of the book are easy to understand but the prescriptions for growth appear quite difficult to complete. It is important to remember that most worthwhile goals in life are not easy to reach.

The book is suitable for any Christian who wants to do more for Christ and live a larger life. As an example of the kind of blessings available to those who pray the prayer, Wilkinson tells the reader about his WorldTeach which is an attempt to build the largest bible-teaching faculty in the world with a goal of 120,000 bible teachers in fifteen years. Now in its fourth year this ambitious program is striving to be in fifty nations with 12,000 teachers by the end of 2001.<br />Wilkinson writes with clarity and the result is an inspirational message.

Colonel Hugh North and Lieutenant Kenny Trotter are sent first to Zamboanga and then to Fort Winfield, an American guided missile base on the island of Sanga Sanga in the Sulu Sea. Their mission is to retrieve a microfilm containing the names of enemy agents still operating in the vicinity of the Philippines.<br />George Lee, a key aide to the deceased World War II enemy spy Arnulf Hansen, had recently been released from a Communist Chinese prison. Lee had known much about the current operatives of the Hansen spy ring who were still in the espionage business. However, Lee was murdered by an American soldier in a seedy bar in Zamboanga before North and Trotter were able to reach him.<br />When North and Trotter finally arrive at remote Fort Winfield, they find five senior officers and four wives whom North identifies as possible enemy agents or suspects in the murder of George Lee. In addition to the microfilm, there is also a collection of valuable pearls at stake. From this point on the story becomes one of old-fashioned detection with Colonel North playing the role of sleuth and Trotter as his admiring assistant.<br />The Pocket Book edition of THE SULU SEA MURDERS was completely rewritten by the author and published in 1958. An earlier version was published in 1933 for The Crime Club, Inc.,  by  Doubleday, Doran &amp; Company, Inc. This review was based on the 1958 edition.	2001-01-27

He is accompanied as usual by his friend, former military intelligence officer and current FBI agent John Lau. Gideon is invited to help the police in the investigation of skeletal remains found in the basement of the du Rocher chateau. Members of the clan have gathered there in answer to a summons from the family patriarch, Guilliame du Rocher. Guilliame's untimely demise by accidental drowning leads Gideon to a current mystery and an old one dating back to World War II. Elkins does a good job of describing the tensions, greed and rivalries resulting from the reading of Guilliame's will. The plot is intricate but easy to follow as Gideon explains each step of the crimes' solutions to John Lau enroute. I understand why the author won an Edgar Award for this book.	2000-11-15
